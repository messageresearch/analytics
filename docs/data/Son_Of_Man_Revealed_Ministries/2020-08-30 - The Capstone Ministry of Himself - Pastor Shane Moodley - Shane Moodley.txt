nobody's running up and down the highlight amen amen i'm waiting to see the day amen amen amen we're singing and worshiping [Music] amen you know king david said i was glad amen and they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord amen are we glad this morning amen amen so he was glad you know he knows he's gonna beat and worship there although he wrote many psalms you know at home and things like that but it was something when he had to go together with the believers there amen amen amen and then when you find his son solomon build the temple and when he prays all right lord if anybody's got a need amen let them look to this temple yes amen let them look towards this temple and answer them amen and then we find when jonah was in the whale's belly he believed while he was bowing down in the whale's belly and he looked towards the temple yes he looked amen so this morning we say lord lord you gave us a provided place of worship we must look to god's provided amen amen place of worship all right for this day amen amen the prophet clearly said god provided place of worship for this day amen and where he put amen amen we give him all the praise amen and all the glory you know we we're hearing home time and see all the signs the events you know in spite of uh some countries are hit with their with their virus they also got uh hurricanes and tornadoes yes louisiana that's where temple is they've got hurricanes and and a lot of destruction and damage and all these things so besides the coveting they're getting even behind the things and earthquakes you know in uh lebanon they had the blast over there and so many people are homeless so many people kill yeah and uh they're going to be disastrous after disasters but we know we are hearing all the time and jesus said in luke 21 all these things must come up for me amen so we are trusting you know we are believing and trusting we are in the last days amen uh we can see nations are actually preparing for war now and they're actually in the seas and aircraft training amen for a while we can see that all around us yes so we just be faithful be faithful and serve him and say lord just give us grace amen amen he also still want to remember he's recovering quite well amen just that he's got a he's got a bag that you know is uh collecting water about 150 to 200 milliliters per day so they want to find a way to stop that blockage you know it's got a bag and drain it from the lung see so uh i was encouraging him and telling him you know what the woman of the issue of blood yes amen amen he said if you can only touch the hem of his garment yes yes and the bible said she was healed instantly amen she was passing blood for 12 years damn amen but instantly it stopped amen so we know god can stop that yes wherever that water is coming and he's uncomfortable getting the bag and sleeping is a bit painful and all but let's pray for him that god will totally deliver him and be driven off the bank also you know remember brother lionel and his family is being transferred to johnsburg uh work working later he's gonna i think he's gonna go sort of the company up there some issues over there and then that there's gonna be in mid-range so he's got a few churches that he's going to decide whether they're going to fellowship there so we pray the lord lead him to the right fellowship and remember them in prayer i was telling them we're going to miss their children singing yes in the group here when they come to sing but pray god will be with them and uh remember them in prayer that uh you know everything will go according to the will of the lord amen so he's the family is living tomorrow morning to jerusalem so uh so you won't be with us so we're going to miss them so we pray god bless them anyway amen amen and keep them daily in your prayers praise the lord he is worthy of our place now from this coming wednesday we resume our normal wednesday service right we'll come back to normal wednesday service we'll officially be in spring not winter we'll be in spring i'd be glad for that but i'm here you waiting for another spring amen amen amen there'll be another spring amen we thank god for them so from wednesday we'll get a noble our normal services wednesday service and then also in september we will also have our communion service but there will be a community service so we pray god bless us amen we're happy to have our apostle shane with us to sacrifice the time and uh they've also been out of church for from their lock down there from march uh they were forbidden to go to the school and use the place and all but i think they're going back this week after so many months and then so we pray god will bless them and the believers out there i've preached there quite a few times and i tell you there is a simple humble group of people amen very simple humble down to earth so just pray for them that god will bless them and thank pastor shane also you know i've seen pastor shane on the dead bed i didn't see him on the dead bed some of you others must have seen him on the dead birthday but the lord raised him up amen the lord healed him and he's being going around a few services churches blessing them with the word amen so we thank god he spurred him that he can still preach the word praise the lord so we pray god and bless him this morning take the sacrifice and to come this morning and and minister to the word of the lord so we once again say lord if you can bless us with one word i'll be satisfied amen god knows all our needs amen say there's nothing about god he knows all our needs and i was thinking this morning while i was getting ready and shaving and i reckon lord i was thinking about the church the people coming to church and uh with your what you know some of david said i was glad amen so i was thinking a lot how are the people coming are they glad to come are they forced to come and then uh while thinking on those thoughts the prophet tells us many times god showed him exactly where people are sitting before the service could start while he was at home god showed him exactly who was sitting there amen so god is mindful amen and you also show them exactly what color of clothing and everything they're sitting god knows everything now when he was at sunset mountain day and there was a brother mcgeuse he asked brother branham do you get visions out here in the mountains and things and then while speaking to him he says you know what he saw that he had a heart problem and the doctor he saw the doctor examining him a few days ago and telling him you're going to lose an eyesight amen right over there in the sunset mountain but he said the lord has healed you amen amen amen and he said beside that before you leave home your mother told you when you meet brother brennan she picked up a skirt and she showed him some problem with the leg i don't know what it was some leg vague problem or whatever it is please tell brother branham to pray for me and he says this is what happened your mother told you when you meet me please pray for me hallelujah amen all right praise the lord she's healed amen amen you know it's all things right so we trust him and believe him this morning he knows our means he knows how much we love him amen he knows how much we serve him thank you lord amen he knows how much we want to be perfect amen praise the lord how many of you looking for perfection thank you we all looking for perfection thank you he sees that amen and he knows me we're fed up of living here in this earth yes amen we want perfection we want to be hard of hearing amen praise the lord and if the lord carries the best thing to get out of here is why d e a t h praise the hello amen the best way to get out of here quickly is death amen praise the lord amen you know christian can't die amen he died two thousand years ago and he wrote a lot amen so we can't die amen we're near those heroes amen praise the lord you believe that amen amen let's stand and pray the lord will bless us for the word this morning in the presence of jehovah i'll be glad for that amen god will make a way for us press on the battle love him with all our hearts all our mind all our soul great in the presence of jehovah [Music] [Music] god [Music] uh [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] amen shall we pray the most gracious and eternal god yes as we are bowed in your divine presence on this great and wonderful resurrection morning it behooves us of our souls to be gathered in such fashion lord [Music] in the accompaniment of your spirit to give us thoughts yes to give us your word amen [Music] this we humbly say this morning yes how glad we are that we never found this message for the message from us so collectively as we have gathered here and in the live stream we pray near god that will be given to you of your undivided attention at all times thank you lord for without you we can do nothing wrong yes we'll just be trusted [Music] different directions different line of thoughts that is the work of the devil but father as we heard what your servant master ronald again has [Music] ourselves to be in that beautiful condition and that you one ministry the son of man ministry of god with the revelation that's deep down in our hearts we pray and we test the service over to you that you may give absence lord that you may speak through this vessel that you are forwarding that we may be found in your presence just glad oh god to be in this place we commit everything to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray of whom this blessed revelation is our lord i want to greet you all in the wonderful and mighty name of our lord jesus christ amen so glad that we could be here this morning to come up here and just to be a blessing to the church amen amen and we have a wonderful message yes that's the message of the hour it teaches us he brings us to a position sometimes we may not remain you know we may just feel why it is like this way but we fail to realize that god is shaping us amen and holding us to that perfection spoken of amen so as the pastor said it only takes death to be there but now we have the word amen to be in position whereby we would be glad to see that we are the word bright and we are bringing the rapture amen and let us give our hearty hand to the lord [Applause] i want to speak on a subject matter this morning uh the capstone revelation of himself amen praise the lord amen and in search there is this the time when brandon brought a subject matter pertaining to that no man and it's revelation chapter 10 1-7 we have your bibles let's get to it amen amen i'm so glad that the pastor of this church here has such wonderful ministers coming up the joshua the sunny brother adrian coming up wonderful musicians that are here and it only takes the grace of god in the functioning of his spirit to perform that which he has purposed amen for them in their lives to be a blessing to a passion of the bride of jesus christ on the side of eternity may god be praised amen john was caught up in the isle of patmos and when he was caught up in the isle of patmos and he opened up and in revelation chapter 10 it says chapter 10 he says and i saw that means john saw another mighty angel clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head now the question arises now church why did john say and i saw another mighty angel why didn't john say i saw an angel why did he say i saw another mighty angel let's catch it and the rainbow was upon his head speaking of the covenant and his face says it where the the sun and his feet has pillars of fire amen hallelujah one day we wonder now why all these things are happening feet as pillars of fire so there were men that were ordained by the pillar of fire to take something and give it into the hearts of the believer in that right there's two and he had his hand his hand he had his hand in his hand a little book open amen the book was open um and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth the book was open amen but nobody read it something was happening and he climbed with a loud voice as when a lion wrote it and when he had cried seven thunders after their voices hallelujah sounded their voices just correlated and when the seven thunders had under their voices i was about to write i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven amen amen hear a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered amen and write them not he was given permission to be caught up in the isle of patmos wrote the book of revelation jesus himself wrote the book of revelation but he was there as a revelator just to come and give these uh scriptures for our admonition written in the bible and we say now hey but how come now what's going on here right he said write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth which angel not when he saw another almighty so that means there was a an angel there he was standing upon who where he stood to stand upon the sea and upon the earth this angel will have power over roman america okay catch and lifted up his hand to heaven the other hand he raised it up to heaven i'm taking authority over the papacy here they can't take advantage over my ministry i am the elijah that came from america amen i didn't have malachi chapter four relationship one chapter 1-7 i am the one that's going to have that authority and denounce the satanic powers and give revelation and power to the blood of jesus christ and sway by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that they're in our and the earth and the things that they're in out and the sea and the things which are they aim that they should be kind no longer amen our blood is in our darkness of our heart amen we have the supremacy we have the power amen it all was performed at calvary amendment to destroy the words of the devil yes but the devil cannot destroy us hallelujah amen amen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound wow there's a changing dispensation the mystery of god in this great mystery this great mystery the capstone revelation of himself this great mystery about the goddess will be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets may take the company god bless you thank you so there were a lot of key verses in there that sometimes we may read it on casually but you see brother branham was a word prophet and being a word prophet he was directed brother america he was directed spiritually amen to conduct his god-given ability amen and power and ministry to a god-given people to go into the rapture there will be some that will not chase death but they will be caught up and now we need to understand amen amen i'm so glad that i could be identified with your pastor amen because your pastor has the ability of getting from god to feed you amen i've been listening to the brethren here that has been ministering the word of the lord and the pastor ministering the word of the lord and you know i was praying when he told me a few weeks ago and i've been praying and said lord what am i what are you going to give me that i could be used in this ministry for your church in the son of man ministry amen then i suddenly this this thought that i was reading church ages the capstone revelation of himself then i said now lord how would i know now whether everything is okay hey you will be there son of man ministry you will be here at that church because the son of man ministry will identify the capstone ministry of himself amen [Music] pastor ronnie was ministering here just saying a few words i said lord use him but i see now suddenly he gave the servant over to me but anyway i'll catch him sometimes praise the lord amen okay first of all we must understand amen that brother branham uh is speaking about the six dreams plus a vision that transpired in his life and in his ministry man that's right so there are many people that will deviate from this spell presuming what it is this way or what it is that way amen but we need to catch the revelation amen and catching that revelation it will centralize logically our thought of direction through the world brother branham taught us amen there is scripture right requires a revelation a scripture requires a revelation anybody can get a torch and say this and say that and presume wrenching without authority but friends this is a serious business amen we're going to eternity amen i don't want one word that you've misconstrued then i don't want one line of thought that's going to be saying here there on the other i want to be true to the word amen and the only way that i could be true to the word lie that if you could show me the path of righteousness to act the way that i could act as a believer and do the things that i could do that would surpass my thoughts of nature into a realm of spiritual advancement that i will be adopted son and a daughter of god so therefore now over the years william brennan had learned obedience through the things which he suffered every minister will suffer you will suffer i will suffer amen he had learned to wait on a clear-cut decision from the lord and once he knew it he had learned to act on that decision too many times we want to act on decisions the decisions that we act on is not the way that it should be acted on understanding misunderstanding you say amen amen so it was with this with his decision to move westward he waited until it was god's time amen i want to tell you something we come to church to build our spiritual life yes amen we eat the word we want to act the word we want to manifest the word but it is a progression of time you see like a child when it's born you cannot take meat or whatever and give the child there are certain nutrients that the child must have to develop him or herself into what you are today so we take good parents the father and the mother to bring up the child according to the way of the lord amen that really goes oh it won't depart from him amen so naturally you take care of them and provide for them and give them everything as a parent that they should continue the work for the lord spiritually speaking we have a five-fold ministry and the five-fold ministry not only is to the locality of the church but a universal amen and and the revelation of that fifo ministry will be the same revelation that william brennan had amen it can never change amen i am the lord thy god and i change not amen can you see my friends so he had always known that someday he would live in the west as a teenager he had a vision of a cross in the sky with the glory from the cross streaming down upon him okay and in this vision he was standing somewhere out in the west those are the things that we we need to to search and find out like you must realize in uh uh the book of matthew uh the three megas where is he that is born king of the jews we have come from the east and now we're going to west to see where he was being born everything ties from the east to the west amen can you say amen amen praise the lord since his early teen years he had always had that yearning in his spirit to go west this yearning wasn't just for the west it wasn't just for the west in general but rather he felt he was being pulled towards a definite part of the west for him arizona was the place and the poem which he had written as a young boy of 16 years old was strangely prophetic indicating exactly where brother branham will live in arizona okay now he says here brother branham begins by reading the text of revelation 10 1 to 7. how are we going to find out is this the sign of the answer amen is this the sign of the end your pastor is well read he picks up what's happening in the world what's going on and we know revelation 10 7 time shall be no longer thanks for being no longer all these events that are being made clear by prophecy amen so we need to pick these things up by spiritual antenna that has been encrypted before the foundation of the world that nothing can blot out these things from us amen because we have something that will take us and that way there is something that we're going to stand true to and that is the word of the lord amen okay is this a sign of the answer and it goes on right up to revelation 10 1-7 why did he say that let's go further he says and my text if i should call it that tonight is this is this the sign of the answer ants amen we all know that we are living in a glorious time for the church but a horrible time for the unbeliever okay and we are living in one of the most dangerous times of all that ever was since the world began amen no prophet no apostle never in no time ever ever lived in such a time as we are now america this is the end amen you know if you realize that the statement there the blind makes [Music] you want to get something you want to feed on something lord i need something lord that i that i need to to to know how how i'm developing my spiritual deeds to the spiritual body in the spirit the pastor preached the message of the spirit and and all these kind of things how brother everything is just coincided it's getting together lift up your redemption amen amen praise the lord it is written in the skies it's written over the face of the earth it's written in every newspaper this is the end amen if you can read the handwriting the prophet lived in the time when the handwriting was on the wall for a nation but we are living when the hand writing is on the wall for a time we know that time blends into eternity we know that we bypass our theophany and came into this world now through this world that we are living in there's something that is taking place inside of us you may not understand god understands and in its season he will let you know that you are a gene seed of god amen if you are a gene seed of god then you are planted right you are watched right you are fed right you will grow right and you will be all right amen amen so we must search the scriptures to find the hour that we are living amen yes always a true prophet of god will go to the scriptures therefore is absolute that it's going to be the way in the old testament when the prophets said anything they're always somewhere was a prophet with a word or stayed with the word amen can you say amen amen so there was a blessed plague of alan there the human common and all those kind of things that were there when something was true it will flash you know it is right i'm in the right track i'm moving but if it's it's not lighting up something is something is wrong and don't want to do this anymore i don't want to do it lord i want to act right do right and do the things that you for they need to do can you say amen amen look at david david took another man's wife he instructed that army got to take him and put him in the front deck and kill him but yet god loved him and chosen look at saul what he did look at all those people in the bible look at ray of the holidays yes look at the woman at the well yes look at the woman that they ran and came through and just said to the uh to jesus this woman was caught in adultery this death so we all come through different walks of life through simon and trespasses and once the uh word of the lord stuck the gene soul inside of us we are a new creature in a new creation in a new environment in the new message in a new directive way of thought that we will be a son and a daughter of god don't look to the past and look for your future amen that's your destiny he watched god for visions and if his visions was contrary to the word then his vision was wrong i was thinking about the yura that's god's way of getting his word to his people now i'm going to read a quote for you the bride church will come to his headstone okay 171 of the church age book if your pastor gives me a chat bookmark check it look at it praise the lord overwatch amen praise the lord you love him amen okay 171 i said in paragraph two yes what i am trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own time amen even according to genesis 1 verses 11. amen amen now why is he bringing this into catching our attention for what he wants to say this morning let's go further and god said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb healing seed and the fruit tree hearing fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself amen upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the sea came fought into a plant and danced into fruit amen the very same law applies to the church paul said i have planted amen upon us as water but it is god that giveth the increase hallelujah so it is god that has given the increase to the son of man ministry that's here and to the bright universal throughout the entire world whatever seed started in the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed amen in these last days the true bright church christ's seed will come to the headstone and she will be the super church as super race as she needs him amen amen they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image amen this is in order to be united with him amen absolutely they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god amen denominations cannot produce this amen long seed amen see you you may have a a group and then they come and you know what happens come go come and go and whatever it is they just can't take it because why the nutrients that's given from the help disk of god doesn't warrant the state because they they they're looking at what they want to satisfy the ego and they the position and then they're gone but the true bride will stay because she is the seed of god see what i mean never be discouraged amen what a friend we have in jesus amen amen praise the lord hallelujah they will produce the creeds and the dogmas mixed with the word this mongrelizing bring spot a hybrid product right now friends our attention is being driven to this morning with a capstone revelation of himself amen our thoughts now are projected by why brother branham was bringing these things out for our admonition to see whatever transpired day will be the very same thing will be transpiring here amen amen you know what to watch the capstone revelation so i'm bypassing a few things here and then we're going to go into the dreams okay you got that book says this is the time you can go through there and uh i am sure uh you will you will be blessed amen now i'll just read to you uh right the first dream now the strange thing happened about a year ago i was having services one night down at brother junior jackson's church just to show you how god deals with these people we have a group the prophet of malachi 4 the bride each we also have junior jacksons they go on the daylight stream and whatever yeah but i want to show you now the divisions that are not staying true to what brother branham has brought for us amen are you happy amen just to show you how god deals with his people knowing what was going to happen brother jackson dreamed the dream in february of 1961. he couldn't get away from it and i was leaving and i was leaving his church amen and he just couldn't stand it while the prophet is leaving the church and he come to me and he said something is on my heart i must tell you brother bran and he said i dreamed a dream you know i just said stop and i listened and watched right and he said i dreamed that there was a great big hill like out in a field where blue grass or something was and said up on top of this hill where the water had washed away the soil there was a top rock up on top of the hill like the top of the mountain right it was a rock no glass and where the water had washed down it had cut some kind of readings on this stone streaming nuts this is the thing that i had and the water the washing of the water by the wood washed and there were writings on that stone okay and where the water had washed down it had cut some kind of readings on these stones and you were standing he saith they're interpreting this reading on these stones and said the brethren from georgia and from all around we are all standing together listening to you interpret that mysterious writing on those stones that mountain he said then you picked up something like from the air but before we go there we spoke about the writing i want you to catch an attention to revelation chapter 5 when he said you know the seals were written within and on the side sealed with seven seals just a thought that you have on the back of your mind as you are now listening and having your attention to what the property is saying okay now i will read you something here from the church age just to appease your spiritual hunger okay are you with me amen praise god i'm happy for this message no matter what every process said i was in my deathbed but i will never leave this message i will just go with the lord just past you and i'll say lord snake away from me okay now revelation of himself you're in the right place you're in the right ministry you have a god-given pastor respect him appreciate him amen before he sleeps he has to take each one of you and present him to god amen for your soul day morning evening take them work safe bring them back lord supply to every need and do all those kind of things huh it's it's an easy job pass the job i like to be sitting there somebody passing yeah amen thanks a lot yes let's go he says here now you know brother branham made a remarkable statement he said that the god and revelation is above every other revelation amen we need to understand that that the godhead revelation is above all other revelation if you don't have that revelation which is your foundation you will never grow up into realizing and understanding the capstone ministry why did brother branham come he came because of her purpose and what was the purpose to gather the bride together to make them ready to get into the rapture time shall be no longer amen we need to expedient our time in relationship to the word of god to act and to grow spiritually in the administration of christ come and say amen amen yes yoga of the old testament the god of the amen sorry i'll just go to you first just say the amen jesus is the amen of god jesus is the so be it of god amen stands for finality amen stands for finality amen so either what other things that you want to add up here to add finality amen it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise it stands for the seal of god grieve not the holy spirit of god where whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption so the seventh seal shields you into the day of redemption the seventh seal is a progression of revelation to the end when we are caught up for it to be concluded i want you to watch this carefully now and see something really sweet and beautiful i said this is his end time revelation of himself you're just imparting just a little don't you know that you are gods are you staying so quiet amen you're god you're walking you're a living bible you're walking you're god so what's so bad about thinking that you are gods and you are god's people you understand god's way of understanding and you're moving on why do you think that you came here you think the devil brought you here the devil didn't bring you maybe you just had little petrol now we can make it then and we go don't worry about cooking the food early and whatever no no let's listen to the word of god amen amen praise the lord the new the new testament does not reveal another god yes doesn't reveal him another god amen we're traveling in the train and he says no i'm a catholic lord how must i approach this person here i mean a message of the hour i didn't know what to do i gave him a book on hebrews i think it was okay and that changed the whole episode in his life and there he is here sitting here today under the tutorship of the son of man ministry praise the lord the new testament does not reveal another god it is a further revelation of the one and the same god christ did not come down to make himself known he did not come to reveal the son he came to reveal and make known the father yes he never talked about two gods he talked about one god and now in this last age we have come back to the capstone revelation the most important revelation of the godhead in the whole bible amen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sum the mystery of god will be completed as he has declared to his servants the promise so we had a prophet in the same time that declared the mystery of god and we cut the mystery of who god was god is and god will be we know about the unmarked uh transcript of the word we know changing the mask we already changed our mask from natural to spiritual say amen amen praise the lord so therefore the seven thunders of revelation 10 1-7 came to pick you up in a steep sincerity of understanding and knowing who you are in your relationship with god amen we have come back to the capstone revelation amen most important revelation of god in the whole bible amen that is jesus is god amen he and the father are one there is one god and his name is god amen so therefore we got to be identified and then where we go with church we go which minister we come in contact yeah so you could be the devil says hey you know yeah lord please lord go down on your knees like john wesley he had one spot there in the cupboard for years and years he played the carpet got one why he was he had the fervent desire to please god right fervent desire to please god try to reach out in the spirit and the passion to know his word and by that way of thought you could see where john wesley was you could see where brother branham was you could see where we the blood of jesus christ he is the god of the a man amen praise the lord let us go further okay so now the water came in watched the rock and there were readings on the stomach they were reading on the stone yeah catch this who saw julia jackson's dream amen reading on the rock john and the isle of patmos he was there seal it up john you don't like it junior jackson you don't like it you don't know you don't know don't capitalize on your own thoughts don't capitalize on your own way watch and pray god will reveal it to you what these things went to be god sends one prophet yes for the age yes and this prophet will have a prophetic utterance yes it will be the voice of god another people amen amen so therefore we need to adjust ourselves in the line of thought in the perseverance of our prayer amen and the understanding of the scriptures to earmark ourselves in a spiritual growth that will be appeasing to ourselves and to god yes amen okay here he goes now he said then you picked up something like from the air something like a wrecking bar or a crowbar how you done it i don't know and said you struck the top of the mountain ripped it around and lifted the cap on it off it was in the shape of a pyramid i want to tell you something you as an individual you can't lift up a boulder right you can't have a border you can't be strong but you want to put something there you can turn your face you said somebody come please help me i want to shove this thing over one man tipped that ball and he cut open the top and it was in the shape of a pyramid in the light of this dream so that there must be something you know now it's written on the outside and supposed to be in the inside what this is all about hallelujah amen this is only this is for the bride amen praise the lord amen he ripped it around and looked at the cap of it off it was in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top of it off now that was months and months and months before the pyramid message the statute of the perfect man amen right was preached and said we need that was white stone granite and he said the sun has never shined on this before look watch this higher order by prophets amen okay because a prophet is a divine revealer absolutely you are england you got eagle eye your eye is getting transformed to reach to higher heights to seep way down to see way down to see things are you are you catching it brothers amen praise the lord so there's no other higher order right now he said further we have upon this rock you will build my church amen amen and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it but we will prevail against it can you say amen so it is a revelation pertaining to this rock which is an uh which is that great revelation that we need to understand and let's go on this is only the first dream best mission let's go and he says and in brother jackson's dream i said to the brethren look upon light has never come i said to the brethren to that brother brothers they were following brother branham amen watch here okay i said to the brethren look upon this light has never come upon its before and when all of them got up and i told them to watch that and all of them came up to look in while they were looking next to me i slipped over to one side and start going towards the west towards the setting of the sun coming up here going down a hill coming up a hill going down a hill getting smaller and smaller and went all the way out of sight if you are reading the message correctly and understanding the spirit inception of the world brings about brother branham going down and he's vanishing you know why because he was caught up in the constellation there was something between god and man to be brought out to the private age hallelujah so something happened then now let's go okay you say he speaks about that naturally down under there in the ages that formation was the light had never come upon that stone nobody had a revolution of that stone right brother branham was the light of this age come on now we are not doing laudation that we are out we are moving the cemetery message is moving like a magnet it's moving here it's moving there it's moving about everywhere and then praise the lord so he's the light of this age so if he's the light of this age then he must interpret what that capture of himself is okay it looked out of the you looked at the corner of the eye and watched and i slipped over and he went away out of the side and now when i did that he said then the brethren turned around after a while and said did he vanish where did he go didn't brother branham said catch your attention to that amen don't leave why because they were distracted amen they were distracted amen did you know what was going on okay and said that some took out that way some took one way some another but a very few state and looked on to what i had told you same thing is going into this church here this morning and bride universal amen the second dream not long ago police said brother billy is all torn up he had a strange dream i went to brother beer down at his house house one night when i was waiting on some calls and he said brother branham i had a strange dream okay he said i dreamed that i was going down a stream of water towards the west and there was a road on the left side and i was on the left side going westward on the road seemingly like hunting for cattle and on the right side i happen to notice after i got down there there you were and you were rounding up a big bunch of cattle and there was plenty of feed over there then you got those kettle and started them back up the river they now try and get his attention as to what his dream was all about amen no more than he said he spoke the dream i saw it the notice he said he got a little leery around about me so he went back to look and said that i was coming to a solid mountain what's that junior jackson mountain solid mountain and all at once i vanished and he wondered what was wrong he ran down then he had a little stream on this side that off to the left and he noticed over on my side was a terrific fall terrific fall and then he thought i could have got it got in those falls and perished then he noticed then and he said he looked around and he's seeing the effects of those falls that went down this way and was causing an artesian well and then to spread out but the water wasn't going back in the ground wow you looked across the little branch a little stream and you seen some little animals with round ears and said i believe i will take one and he crossed then in the dream he got to thinking about me he got up on a little gnaw to look over and see if there was a little bitty narrow ledge you know that it could have walked around but said there wasn't nothing and he got worried about that got worried about and said wonder what happened to brother brennan she vanished spoke about that storm right i was standing up on top of a mountain right and told brother biller an interpretation of a dream that i've given him not long ago and told him to wait on the lord that someday i would meet him on an island and there he was fulfillment of the dream now these are all these are things that has been said from the help desk of course to a piece for you to understand for you to know the time and the season in which we are living in right i say okay it's good to have some this meeting or that meaning or whatever but we need to have some form of solid foundation and if we have that solid foundation we will stand together in the unification of his spirit we won't have wandering spirits wandering thoughts whatever we will be one as the father and the son is one we are one with the father we are one with the spirit we are one with the son there's nothing that can pull against it it only takes the spirit of satan to cover and disrupt but it cannot distract you because you're a child of god it will only disrupt them who are not solid and grounded in the word of the lord amen praise the lord are you happy amen let's go to the third dream so now then immediately after that brother roy robinson he had a dream and he dreamed that we were rounding cattle and that in the third one and that is the third one running up chapel and there was grass very deep plenty of food all of us brethren were together they were all together they were not separated we have a meeting you're all together you're not separated can you say amen amen when you have fellowship all together amen not separated praise the lord because while you have an understanding of the spirit amen and what is the understanding of the spirit you want to learn more [Music] amen all of us we have never reached a perfection but if you think that a man knows everything he knows nothing so therefore you need to go down on your knees you get something to understand please the fourth green third dream and he spoke about the cross and the brethren were together and we come to a place for dinner and where the fred shot man raised up and said elijah the great prophet will speak from here today at noon and then when we all had dinner everybody went away and wondered and he wondered why they didn't wait to hear it being spoke the reason why they went away why now see how that exactly curves with brother jackson how does people walk away they never had their eyes focused on brother see all these people had the dinner they walked away they will focus on brother branham and the ministry today all the people will walk away because they haven't got themselves focused on the message of the hour with your brandon's message they know everything but you're doing nothing praise the lord okay then he says didn't hear right and when we all had dinner everybody went away and he wondered why they didn't wait to hear it being spoke now see how that exactly occurred to brother jackson see that it's exactly what brother billy said no one waited to find out what was in those standards no one knew but we need to know it will take a profit to make us understand and make known what the thunderstorm these will divinely turn our hearts so the changing of the hearts will be the revelation of the tenderness and you will no longer be the same if i be lifted up i will draw all neighbors amen wonderful i love that nobody wants to find out only the bride will find out therefore we are amen we are here today to be enlightened by the word amen amen so you never come here just to say well hey i'm sitting and agreeing now you are a foreordained member amen four ordained brave member remember that now he goes on and this is what he says notice in the 15th notice immediately after that sister colin collins dreamed a dream of being here at of being here at the church and there was a wedding fixing to take place and when she did she saw the bridegroom come in perfect the bridegroom come in perfect catch the spiritual concept of what is being said here but the bride wasn't very perfect yet it was a bride we are not yet perfect but we are the bride so we are following the spiritual digestive order of the word to be fully nourished in the way that god allows it to be in the individual as he takes and retains the word to grow up into that which god has proposed can you say amen amen that's what different people do in different times some people catch it some people don't catch it later on this that and the other let's move on amen let's hold to god unchanging he's the only one that could make a way for us putting first put in number one more than your wife more than your husband more than your child more than anything else put god first and i want to see a person that put god's first as feelings in his life he goes and he says that and immediately after he said that uh but the bride wasn't very perfect here it was a bribe now that is the church and there was like a communion or a service going on there like a dinner being set and it kind of forgot next to her because what brother neville was serving at dinner in the church but she said it was the best food that she had ever seen brother branham spiritual food is the best we cannot take an understanding of anybody else yes we cannot take an understanding of what that brother said that pastor said this said and that said if anything has got to be said it's going to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word made manifest with the results it burst 100 upon 100 and i want that nothing else she was so hungry but she thought maybe that in the dream that he shouldn't serve it she and brother willard was going to go up to the ranch house and eat when they did the light on the right hand side went out now you know what that is the food the bride isn't perfect but the bridegroom is perfect the bride is not perfect yet but the food that was being given was not literal food it is the spiritual food that you have been having all along let me stop here on the front dream just a moment you see when your pastor comes to the help desk of god and he ministers the word of god he's giving you food spiritual food and you take that food a digestive friends you don't know how he's going down and how he's praying and how god is revealing and i said to myself today you know i and then the rest of the days i said lord i'm looking at you the augmented head of christ and the seven angels that say on the photograph and i said lord no brother branham looked at him and he prayed lord there was no failure there was nothing else but not only you that was their father that made a provided way can you say amen so god is there god was making a way can you say amen amen praise the lord hallelujah so the spiritual food that comes from the help desk is from the scripture from the message of the hour not from year day and the other the rest of the ministries i certainly checked how they minister so well in this congregation to the congregants and to see that how they are captivated by the word of god and the anointed gift that has been working in them to provide spiritual food in due season amen praise the lord at this point brother branham forces to explain a vision that the lord had given him the previous year in the vision he was instructed to store in food he said and then the food in that little long building i returned to this little building and we made dozens of tapes of the pyramids and everything to show the people the hour that we are living in just for your clarity when he preached the stature of the perfect man they thought that the seven thunders are the virtues there was certain group those groups that went away didn't stay the program you're with me so they were moving in later on as they moved on then the revelation struck them now they come to an understanding of what it was amazing can you say amen praise the lord never give up just pray for them just pray for them don't say any bad things about it just pray for them pray for them lord give them revelation give them understanding we've come this far lord you can make your way for i returned that you spoke about the pyramids and everything to show the people the hour that we are living in now compare even that with the others the dreams this was a vision the food which is here this is the place that will dream right can you say amen praise the lord so everything that abraham said and done it was not something that was uh not far for us it was for the bible you see key words like you know he said you know like for example in revelation 19 uh like john didn't know what to do he didn't know what to say what to do and then he wanted to worship and then he went down on his feet to worship and death don't worship me worship god this is one of their fellow servants amen the brothers one of the prophets or whatever can you say amen so could you see the tendency of the scriptures could you see the revelation that has been bestowed and given to us in the end time that is why the other churches that don't believe the way that we believe amen what can you do it's like you take your water and pouring on touch back you don't stick it'll flow amen hallelujah so therefore in the light of what i'm saying and what the spirit is saying to you this morning hold to god amen hold to the spirit hold to you know please church don't ever fail in your prayer life pray you know i know it's hard i know it's difficult sometimes i know it you don't have to tell me i went through this experience but the holy spirit is revealing to me to tell to you this don't fail of this peace try to get your families together try to get your your families the husbands the wives together whatever pray and pray and pray and see god will turn out something inside of your life that will be so precious to you that you will know the values of jesus christ you will know the words of jesus christ you will know the works of jesus christ why because he has captivated that thought in your heart to do his work to pray everyone thank you lord amen so please don't forget about that thank you put that in your mind and when you go home tonight husband one wives on your bed the children or whatever if the children don't come you continue to pray and pray sooner or later they will children will catch the spirit they will come in they will join you and they will be they what your purpose is notice now then what took place then immediately after the fourth dream that was told me up come a brother parnell and billy wasn't here and the man was frantic and he had a dream and he come to brother wood and he said i just can't let this go i've got to tell it i've got to tell brother branham it is bothering me and god knows not one dream in between them just come one two three four five and six yeah everything was coming true said i had a dream a dream that i was going to have a meeting up there and somehow another there was a meeting here in a new church watch praise the lord this new church how it come out that he wondered why there wasn't cooperating between the two or something on that way there were other churches too there were no cooperation we can't cooperate with the denominations we can't take sides with a denominational pastor him the truth he wants you to praise the lord he doesn't want it go where you go do what you do be happy and gain we will stay with what the prophet tells us and we'll do all what he tells us to do say amen praise the lord amen speaks about the church right and said he was standing here and thought well i've been in here i will just wait and we'll attend the service and said a man come through the building with a brown suit on and a book i think he was writing and he told brother parnell said this is a closed meeting it is only for deacons and trustees well he kind of felt a little stepped on so he went out the door of the new church the church that had been elected or this one repaired fixed over and when he went outside it was snowing bad weather winter time and none of these people know nothing about this watch now and when he went out the door i was standing there looking at whisper and i said don't feel stepped on brother i will direct you what you should do and then brother parnell he said that i said to him brother stop and the first place you will ever come to will be separa which means hyphen don't stay there then go next and you'll find an old woman coming to a climate right and when you're undivided and then don't stop there go again you will find a real old woman don't stop out there and all the time i was talking we were walking through the snow and still in his dream i said go till you find my wife say till you find my wife and when you find my way stop there stop there and say he looked and we was out of the snow on the desert and i had vanished and he looked back and he saw his wife pumping water from a well and some minister pulling on her to pull her away from the pump she was watching him and he will come and watch the interpretation of the dream and that's very important here is the interpretation of your dream and i could have told you that night but i just turned away in so much that zipporah and the old woman and another real real old woman that's churches watch who is telling this interpretation as daniel told the interpretation to nebuchadnezzar now brother branham he's giving the interpretation of this dream to the brother and explaining now that these were churches there are many churches millions of churches there's only one church and the church is a mystical body amen he's a mystical body and the individual is baptized in spiritual revelation to get into that body to be called the church the called out one let's go further see i told him not to stop at them no matter how old they was they were organizations don't stop at them they have lived their time but when he comes to my wife which is my church that jesus christ has sent me to in this last day and here it is stopped there and i was gone a true sign that has been overlooked by others now we are failing to see who is william amen who is this man the prophet of malachi he come in a suit put his hat on when he stood on the helpdesk of god and the holy spirit the pull out of cloud fire was out there who was he he was the voice of god to this generation and the five-fold ministry the pastors and whatever they are the voice of god in the true sense of revelation amen but the same word but the same revelation that william branham had will come from the happiness of god to sustain you to appease your hunger come on say amen amen right so in other words that's jesus christ that sent me to this last day and there it is stopped there and i was gone whispered luke 17 30 revelation 10 1-7 that's a church amen absolutely i don't want to go to another church i want to be in the church i want to be amen i don't want to change i don't want to do this i don't want to do that i have my eternal life lord if i change i might go astray amen please lord help me [Music] let's go now comes the sixth grade then sister steffi came to my house for prayer before she went to the hospital for surgery that god would help her and bless her and he certainly did and she said i have a strange dream brother and she said i dreamed that i was out west and it is rolling country and when i looked standing upon a hill there was a real old man with a long white beard and what hair he had was grown down across his face and he had a white white wrap around something garment and said the wind was blowing and she said listen very carefully i kept drawing closer you were standing up on top of the mountain julia jackson mountain next mountain now mountain [Music] he was standing on top of a mountain watching eastward i wondered who this old man and she moved closer closer and when she got closer listen very carefully church she recognized who it was it was the immortal elijah the prophet standing up there watching the east listen very carefully now she said i must see him she had a knee and she ran up the hill and fell down there to speak in the name of elijah and said when she spoke she had a voice say what do you want sister steffi yes it was me [Applause] your dream was fulfilled right there sister steffi or immediately after that i went to louisville what you was needing was the prayer to see what she got through all right at the hospital and the sign of me going westward watching israel for my flock amen right for my flock amen why says is this time amen my sister is this time why he wanted to go and give to us that interpretation of that rock and we see in the book of revelation 10 1-7 revelation 8 1 and out there brother branham how he was doing things how he was performing how he said now my understanding of these things were quite different to what he has told me now in my room you see you were subjected unto that spirit so when he came there and uh uh day after day day after day the angel of the lord came and spoke to him god in some british guardians of the bridge first year secretary right up to the seventh seal and whatsoever and god was a part of it and he regarded in the book of the revelation of the seventh seal and if you got it brother read it day and night day and night day and night the seven churches day and night day and a day and night it will do something to your sustain to pray for sister stephanie then he goes on you may read that in search this is the time it says here i turned away and that quick something struck it i went home and went into my den room picked up that book that book what book did you and there it was wasn't concrete blocks it was stones i said mira get ready needed to go home now needed to leave that place you need to go because something is taking place he needed to go there he knew that the mighty angels will come down and when the mighty angels come down the pillar of cloud with the reformers and all that they formed jesus christ and he was caught up in the constellation to be there to understand what god has said and then he had his hand a little book that was open and then the messenger the earthly messenger was on earth at the time of his coming so he was captivated in that uh theophanic uh body of glorified body and he received the word of the lord and he came and he was there and taped a change day by day he gave the capital revelation of what it was and that is what we are training on praise the lord hallelujah during the first week of january 1963 brother branham and his family arrived in tucson it was to this oasis on the arizona desert that god led his prophet knowing that soon he would be calling him into the wilderness amen amen okay let's just stop let's go back did brother bryan said that he preached what paul preached amen did paul say he was taught by gamalia that's why i feel that did you say that you know you you taught all these things and but still you never got the satisfaction to have the philippine fire experience when you had the pillar of fire experience where you went he went into the desert did when he went to the desert what happened god spoke to him look to look yeah to hear come on now say amen i never received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ brother branham he went to the backside he went there to the oysters in the arizona desert that god led his prophet knowing that soon he would be calling him into the wilderness god had called his elijah prophet aside for a time of communion and revelation in the wilderness of the catalina mountains the lord will commission his servant for the third and final phase of his ministry come on our same man rejoice hallelujah this phrase would bring an anointing that would not only change the prophet but it's ordained to change a bride for this complete right he says here it has to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to a manifestation of the sons of god coming back and the spirit of god coming in to these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like christ's children it will join them and his church together i think i would have to stop there praise the lord right your thoughts can only take so much next time maybe we can just expand on those things and let god come and make our way and to show to you the capstone ministry of himself now no man was worthy amen to lose the shield amen behold the lion of the tribe of judah amen the lamb opened the seals who is our land come on who is our land is it is it our prophet is it something else or is it whatever it is where is the spirit of god how did the spirit of god come in how did the spirit of god come into and more fair with our prophet messenger who was our prophet messenger what relationship will the word bride be to the world what relationship will the prophet be to the word can you see what i'm saying so when he spoke why did brother branham say look to his wife and then said his wife is the church who are we looking to our husbands and wives who is our condition today do we understand one another do we have a cooperative uh balance of understanding and knowing what we need to do as a husband and a wife amen amen children how are you are you doing the things that god has forwarded for you to do are you respected to your parents to your fathers to your mothers right are you going on the frenzy or this way or that way are you thinking that why am i not prospering why am i not getting a job why am i not doing this that and the other in this lockdown people may have lost at the job people didn't go to work but you as a portion of the bride of jesus christ in this particular area and whichever area in the world god every day gave you a plate of food a drink of water to be sustained and to move on look to god and god will look to you it is with your faith that you exercise like enoch at the testimony that he pleased god being seventh from adam he was translated we come in the seventh church age we come out of the audacia in that phrase of that voice trumpet voice and the trouble and voice we are waiting we are dead anything is going to happen in any time right it's going to happen where we are friends can we give the meditation of our hearts and the thoughts of god to be replaced by the things that we that so easily beset us to be a son and a daughter of god you have a chance this morning to step up into the seventh city to step up in the capstone revelation of himself until you do that you'll have peace that passes all human understanding may god richly bless you amen and keep you to the furtherance of this time of fellowship to be caught up in a spiritual awakening to raptured to be raptured in the rapture in grace it's my humble prayer to you to your pastor and the church and those that are streaming life to them that are out there amen that god be with you shall be great dear heavenly father amen when we came in lord we came in just as the way you brought us in this morning amen but when we listen to the things that you had in store for us amen he changed us yes not to be what he was but to be what you want us to be but lord jesus how appreciative we are towards you for your grace yes your grace lord has brought us and will take us and i pray father for those that are here and another may you forgive us our faults our families our attitude whatever we may have done that

this church and the ministering brotherhood amen pray for brother sonny an excellent minister pray for him as well be his portion healing setting free be the portion of it bless the united gift that thou has bestowed upon them that they may take the word of god and rightly divide it into the hearts of your children so that they could be sustained bless us now father blessing you lord that's my church with my family i pray strengthen me keep me from all i'm in danger heal me completely that i may be of service to you in the fullness of time that you have called me to be your servant in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray and ask these mercies and all shall say amen [Applause] amen you know while the word was coming you know you get thoughts going through your mind you know virtually most babies all babies they need milk yeah they can't get into the hot stuff isn't it but you're not the ego eagles don't drink milk amen the mother don't go and drink milk and give them in the nest she don't get a fresh kill and they start eating meat how many of you know that amen praise that praise a lot amen it says in luke 17 30 the prophet is reminding us where the carcass is the eagles will be gathered that's right amen around praise the lord amen so thank god uh glorious ministry for his last day amen amen that god set up on this earth amen and our people couldn't see it amen theologians bible scholars you know men of the church they couldn't see these glorious lights now one day when they realize we're going to tell them jesus already came amen he came already amen luke 17 30. his glorious message of this day amen in the prophet amen this message is jesus christ so one day when they realize you know what what they have missed in there what they turned out yes now we thank god for this because they'll say it's ripped on the whites but revealed to babes amen so we can feast on this word see they're the learned man the educated bible scholars they know about this message they read it yes they even studied they got their tape library in the in their studies yes but they can't see that's nice brother amen a lot of them are preaching from the message they want the message yeah there's to preach it and they say they can't see this message so the word has come and turned our hearts back thank you jesus for the pentecostal faith see all these hidden troops that were lost through the ages they made known to us amen and these divinely revealed mysterious truths turn our faith back hundred percent we believe it so our hearts are turned back thank you and uh if they can go and study all the ministries right from 1947 there were great men all robots here tia osborne yeah billy graham many many others but never had a ministry like this and then they can see it's completely different to everybody else and they yet they're blinded they wanted to go back to the denominations how many of them came to the prophet and said we know you are preaching the truth amen but if you're going to go teach this and please you're gonna get kicked out but the prophet told them you know what you must be begging for your living on the streets then compromise and go to hell amen sure see some of them even knew it was the truth but they didn't wanna go wrong with it but we thank god he opened our eyes amen not to see these things see that's what will take uh it'll take a special people to believe these things amen say the bride special thank you the bride is predestinated and the prophet said the rapture is for the bride correct pre-destinated bride she's ordained to be there and then you know if you're listening to the messages you'll pick up the things the problem is saying while he's preaching and making altar calls and all yes and he's telling people give your heart to the lord come and serve him it talks about predestination he says if you're not in the predestination god has also made a way for you yes and he talks about free model agencies amen we don't come in by free model agencies no sir pick up a destination but there's people can come in by free moral agency amen they can they can repent and see that you know see what the message is about see what the law is all about and they receive it he actually says that god has made a way for you through free moral agency i'm glad for that amen so people that want to repent and receive the lord jesus christ they can't like the thief on the cross there the last minute he had no chance he had no chance to get baptized he had no chance to be part of a church nothing but right there he spoke to the lord to remember him amen and he said tonight you'll be with me in paradise he never got baptized the lord he received his salvation before even jesus was crucified and not went on the ground amen look at that glorious thing he got saved there on the cross okay see so let's press on the battle if you haven't been maybe what we are listening here maybe we need to go and brush up and then take our books up and study and you know amen you know get freshened up with what's being spoken amen see we spend too much time it's not that we haven't got time we've got plenty time amen but we use it for other things yes amen yeah we got we don't really pray that we ought to pray we don't study and read like we ought to study in the amen see how many of you when you may be sitting and reading your bible and you know you're reading video and you quickly grab your bible again and you start reading reading reading it happens it falls down again amen and you quickly get up you grab your bible does it happen to you yes amen happened to you but you know what happened to a lot of people they're on the cell phones yes they're on the whatsapp yes you're on youtube hey look it up put it on again yes oh yeah the eyes will close sleeping look at the phone again yes huh yes they don't want to sleep because of the phone so they're always late let's brush up on these things and uh you know we're living in the in the hallway now yes amen amen god revealed this glorious life yes no so let us keep walking and you know praising the lord and doing things you know we just before this uh when we had our last meeting with the brothers we're planning on doing outreach work and going out and doing outreach or something like that now we were robbed of all that yes but that was our desire and then we wanted to do something now you know but uh let's we can still do things individually you know see we we've opened together the uh place there and get out of there but we had all those opportunities but now we can go individually and then and we can witness do something for the lord thank the lord let this uh you know be like those two men on the way to him yes what they said did not our hearts burned within us yes amen amen while he spoke to us along the way the word himself and the hearts were burning yes so we have the word here let our hearts burn every day amen let everything take second secondary place and say lord we thank you for your love your message amen give us grace to press on thank you lord see all this what we have now was history once it was prophecy now it's history now we are part of that history living today we are part of it i mean right there in the book of uh daniel daniel didn't understand but he said seal up the book to where until the time of the end yes sir see so we are right here at the end time hey man the books have been opened right no more books should be opened yes sir okay so let's press under the word stay with the word and uh you know as if anybody knew who jesus christ was it should be the prophet amen glory because he had a personal encounter right so what is telling you jesus christ is god the father is one he had a personal experience amen amen praise the lord see so we believe that and it's revealed to us so people come and tell us contrary things we must stand up and say listen yeah this was not the way people start i was the only one that did the challenge amen amen when the preacher came and preached and said in the other meetings and he said no jesus not god no what is he talking about i was the only one amen amen none of the other pastors there amen took up the challenge amen man i challenged him i've sent him all the quotes on the goddamn amen and he was trying to put his own interpretation and there was another person trying to back him up and you know try to say this and say that amen but we showed him all the quotes and he all had his orders he was trying to bring in subtle two lords but we protested and protested and then the second time he preached he did the same thing and then i brought it up again amen none of the pastors want to challenge it amen we have the word amen but you know the third time he preached he preached him right he preached the goddess right amen he actually preached jesus christ he's god amen so let's stay with the world and press on and serve him he has made a way for us amen amen amen let's stand together [Music] you are here you're working in this place i worship you are here [Music] let's sing it out again
