[0:00] I pray you are blessed amen hallelujah
[0:02] you know today is a special day the the
[0:04] prophet was getting ready to start to
[0:05] preach the Seven Seals and the Seven
[0:08] Seals was a special time for us because
[0:10] that's why those Seven Angels Came Down
[0:12] Amen to reveal those seals when he was
[0:15] caught up into the constellation of
[0:17] angels He was told go back to the east
[0:21] for there's coming forth the revelation
[0:23] of the Seven
[0:24] Seals so he had to go west to connect
[0:26] with the angel amen hallelujah and no
[0:30] Ministry can survive in this hour if
[0:31] they don't connect with the angel
[0:34] Hallelujah if they are not following the
[0:36] instruction remember Mary could only
[0:39] bring the word to pass because she
[0:41] connected with the Angel's message amen
[0:44] now in Revelation 10 there's a voice
[0:46] from heavan saying to John the bride
[0:48] connect with the angel go take the book
[0:51] connect with the angel so no ministry
[0:53] will be successful neither will you grow
[0:56] neither will you come to your full
[0:57] potential if you don't connect with the
[0:59] angel of God amen amen praise the Lord

[1:28] after its kind
[1:30] amen whose seed is in itself upon the
[1:33] Earth and it was so amen praise the Lord
[1:38] amen so we know that's the law of
[1:40] reproduction that every seed must bring
[1:43] forth after its own kind amen are you

[1:49] forth after your own kind in this time
[1:51] let's turn to Ephesians chapter 1 amen

[1:55] seed we have within
[1:58] us we'll read from verse

[2:41] before him in love having predestinated
[2:44] us unto the adoption of
[2:47] children by Jesus Christ to himself

[4:17] he promised you the Holy Ghost and he
[4:19] said out of your innermost being shall

[5:51] because I
[5:54] have I have a normal sermon but then
[5:57] I've got the quotations which is seven p
[5:59] pages to back up what I am
[6:02] saying amen so I can preach under the
[6:04] anointing under the inspiration or I can
[6:06] take you quote by quote and prove what I
[6:08] am saying either way we'll come to the
[6:10] same
[6:11] conclusion amen but we'll trust the Lord
[6:14] amen hallelujah amen the preparation was
[6:16] there for as the spirit leads amen so
[6:19] praise the Lord amen how many of you uh
[6:22] appreciate the Lord for what he's doing
[6:23] in this time amen amen hallelujah so my
[6:28] title will be the Holy Ghost birthing
[6:30] the seed of God Amen the Holy Ghost
[6:35] birthing the seed of God Amen Hallelujah
[6:40] now we'll go to our first quote there
[6:42] and uh the prophet says if you want to
[6:45] know what stage the church is watch the
[6:48] stage the woman
[6:50] is cuz she is the
[6:53] church watch what she is
[6:56] doing amen now if I watch this church
[7:00] amen I can see what stage the church is
[7:03] in I can see what kind of woman you are
[7:07] amen because the prophet saying if you
[7:08] want to know what stage the church is
[7:10] watch the stage the woman is cuz she is
[7:13] the church watch what she is doing amen
[7:17] now we got a strong church amen we got a
[7:19] faithful church amen hallelujah amen
[7:23] this is no ordinary time you see the
[7:25] Holy Ghost pouring out in this day is
[7:27] like no other time before amen yeah you
[7:31] can't reference it to any other time
[7:33] before because the Holy Ghost has come
[7:35] in this time for a special purpose amen
[7:39] amen the prophet says the evening
[7:41] messenger loose the Holy Ghost he says
[7:44] denominational Rivers had him bound but
[7:46] the evening messenger comes to set the
[7:48] Holy Ghost
[7:50] free amen so this is adoption time this
[7:54] is our time this is our season to
[7:57] manifest to bring to pass scriptures
[8:00] concerning us amen hallelujah amen now
[8:05] you know that the prophet of God tells
[8:06] us that Adam and you can read it in the
[8:09] Bible was a created spoken seed
[8:13] son amen he was like God he could speak
[8:17] to all creation on the earth and they
[8:20] would obey him I if you can testify that
[8:23] you read that in the message amen he was
[8:25] an original son and if he was an
[8:28] original son that operated in that way
[8:31] but he fell from his position we must be
[8:34] restored back to that position amen yes
[8:38] last week we were speaking on
[8:40] Dominion you can't have
[8:43] dominion if you don't have control of
[8:46] things you don't if you don't have
[8:48] control over your situation over your
[8:51] circumstance amen over your trial God is
[8:54] not going to suddenly put you on a stage
[8:58] to perform signs wonders and miracles if
[9:01] in your life there is internal
[9:04] chaos if you have no peace within you if
[9:08] there's a storm within you you can't
[9:10] speak to a physical
[9:12] storm amen you first got to be
[9:15] spiritually calm no storm within you
[9:18] because the man that is operating like
[9:20] this is the master of all
[9:24] circumstances God is not going to clown
[9:26] around and make you the master of every
[9:29] the circumstance but you are not a
[9:31] master of your own
[9:34] circumstances you go read in perfect
[9:36] Faith Jesus lived in a world that nobody
[9:39] knew about and he says he was the master
[9:41] of all circumstances but he was able to
[9:44] control himself
[9:45] first amen hallelujah don't say my
[9:49] tongue is uncontrollable don't say my
[9:51] emotions are uncontrollable you can
[9:53] control it with the word you can control
[9:56] it with prayer amen you can bring your
[9:59] body the flesh man under
[10:01] subjection amen so we must be restored
[10:03] back to our position amen amen amen we
[10:08] have fallen sons who were birthed the
[10:10] animal way because Eve was given a
[10:12] choice whether she was going to produce
[10:14] another Son of God via the spoken word
[10:18] or reproduce a son bya the animal
[10:22] way now how many of you would agree Eve
[10:25] had the word of
[10:27] God Eve had the word word of God she
[10:29] quoted back the word yes so Eve had the
[10:33] word of God Amen she knew what the word
[10:35] of God said so we see knowing what the
[10:38] word of God said is not good
[10:40] enough having the word of God is not
[10:42] good enough amen praise the Lord her
[10:46] guide her leader
[10:49] Adam right had the mind of Christ and he
[10:52] knew what to be what was to be done with
[10:54] the word amen but we find she was on her
[10:58] own at this time amen she had the word
[11:03] but she had no
[11:04] guide you see why the Holy Ghost is
[11:06] important amen you can have the word but
[11:09] you got to have the Holy Ghost so he had
[11:12] the word but she had no guide amen she
[11:15] left the headship so she did not know
[11:17] what must be done with the word so the
[11:20] serpent found a way to make her to
[11:23] reason with the word and when she
[11:26] reasoned with the word she chose to
[11:28] reproduce amen hallelujah according to
[11:30] the animal
[11:32] [Music]
[11:34] way amen she did not want to wait time
[11:37] wait for God's time and season she did
[11:40] not want to wait for God's purpose to be
[11:41] fulfilled yes she found a substitute way
[11:44] to reproduce amen amen hallelujah
[11:49] amen so you know even in
[11:51] nature trees bear fruit in its
[11:55] season and we just read every seed must
[11:58] bring forth after its kind in its season
[12:01] Eve didn't want to wait for the right
[12:03] time and season yes because that's a law
[12:06] of reproduction amen according to time
[12:08] and season amen you find even the Animal
[12:12] Kingdom reproduces in their season they
[12:16] are not like men who can reproduce any
[12:18] time of the year
[12:21] Hallelujah so she left she did not want
[12:24] to wait for a guide she left the guide
[12:27] and stepped out on the grounds of
[12:28] reasoning and she was deceived now when
[12:31] Adam comes he finds a deceived
[12:33] Church yes amen and this deceived church
[12:37] has an animal seed within
[12:39] her amen she knew so Adam knew that God
[12:43] was going to kill
[12:45] Eve so to save her he puts his seed
[12:48] within
[12:50] her amen same way God Saves Us by
[12:54] putting his word within us because the
[12:56] word of God is a seed amen amen so we
[13:00] know that we came to the Earth amen from
[13:03] the Eternal thoughts of God Amen
[13:05] Hallelujah we came to flesh the prophet
[13:07] would say we bypass the AL theophany
[13:10] amen Adam fell away from the original
[13:13] faith and when he fell Adam did not lose
[13:17] his
[13:18] seed yes Adam lost his position Adam
[13:22] lost his authority but the seed remain
[13:25] original amen come on now amen the seed
[13:28] remain the original amen you can fall
[13:31] you can fail amen you may come across
[13:33] trials in your life amen you may come
[13:36] across Temptations but the seed of God
[13:38] remaineth within you amen trust the seed
[13:41] amen thank you Lord hallelujah thank you
[13:44] Lord the prophet says a seed amen
[13:46] sometimes can backslide amen but if it's
[13:48] a true Original Seed it must come back
[13:50] to its original condition amen thank you
[13:53] Lord amen hallelujah amen so he didn't
[13:57] lose his seed he lost his position he
[14:00] lost his authority amen he lost his
[14:02] godship he fell but the seed remained
[14:05] within him that's why Amen in this time
[14:08] we must go back to the original Faith
[14:11] amen amen amen hallelujah our birth is
[14:14] based on Adam's birth because Adam was a
[14:17] spoken word seed Son of God amen amen
[14:21] and the prophet is preaching a message
[14:22] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[14:26] amen so we are going back not just to
[14:29] Pentecost but we are going back before
[14:31] the fall we are going back to full
[14:34] restoration somebody say amen amen
[14:37] hallelujah amen get search theology out
[14:40] of you we are going all the way back to
[14:42] the beginning amen read the three-fold
[14:44] mystery purpose he is taking a a restore
[14:47] amen Jesus Christ Eve to a restored Eden
[14:50] again so we're going back to our
[14:53] original condition oh yes hallelujah
[14:56] amen aren't you glad Jesus didn't redeem
[14:58] us partially to make us half superhuman
[15:02] amen amen to give us certain powers and
[15:04] limitations but he's come to restore
[15:06] amen the word of God says I will restore
[15:09] sayith the
[15:11] Lord amen if you lost things in your
[15:13] life expect full restoration if Satan
[15:16] has stolen from you expect back a full
[15:19] restoration amen job was expecting back
[15:22] a full restoration and he got back seven
[15:24] times
[15:25] amen yes Lord our God is a god of
[15:29] multiplication he could have replaced
[15:31] what Adam lost amen but he's a god of
[15:35] multiplication praise the Lord amen amen
[15:38] amen hallelujah amen so we must go back
[15:42] to the original Faith amen because
[15:44] Adam's birth is what we are
[15:46] after Adam's condition is what we are
[15:49] after amen a created SE son we must be
[15:53] restored to what from what we fell from
[15:55] we came to the earth born in sin but the
[15:57] mystery is the seed of God was always
[16:00] within
[16:01] us we did not know this at first we
[16:04] thought we were born the son of chinami
[16:08] Amen we thought we were born amen the
[16:10] son of some
[16:11] men and they gave us our our identity
[16:14] and we walked around proudly saying I am
[16:17] the son of
[16:18] chinami Amen we walked around amen
[16:22] because maybe the certain family has a
[16:24] certain Prestige amen holds a certain
[16:26] social status amen but that can only
[16:29] take you so far in this
[16:30] life amen hallelujah but inside of us
[16:34] there was a gene of God am inside of us
[16:37] amen the seat of God is locked up inside
[16:40] waiting for the right time and
[16:43] season amen
[16:47] hallelujah now based on our first birth
[16:50] we can't get back to our original
[16:53] condition so God made a way for us to be
[16:55] reborn to take us back to Eden amen
[16:58] that's the way of redemption that's the
[17:01] way of the Cross that's the way of the
[17:03] blood that's the way of forgiveness by
[17:06] accepting what Jesus Christ did for us
[17:07] on Calvary it's the way of the holy
[17:10] spirit amen
[17:13] hallelujah this is a time and season
[17:15] amen for the restoration of seed Sons
[17:19] amen hallelujah seed Sons Spirit sons of
[17:22] God we have a message to restore us back
[17:25] to our original condition the holy
[17:27] spirit is here now to burp that seed and
[17:30] bring us back to our original condition
[17:32] amen amen the Holy Spirit couldn't burp
[17:35] the seed in any other age because it was
[17:37] not meant for Sons to come back to full
[17:40] Restoration in any other age therefore
[17:43] the holy spirit is outpouring itself in
[17:45] a different way right now because it has
[17:47] a different kind of seed to birth oh yes
[17:50] thank you Lord thank you Lord amen
[17:54] praise the Lord I pray the Holy Spirit
[17:56] will make clear what I'm trying to tell
[17:57] you amen hallelujah
[17:59] amen when you become a true seed of the
[18:01] word covered by the blood you go back to
[18:04] your
[18:06] innocence because what is the blood
[18:09] doesn't the prophet say it's like
[18:11] Clorox it strikes off every sin and it
[18:15] takes it back to the original come on
[18:17] now You Really Got to Believe In The
[18:19] Blood You Really Got to Believe In Jesus
[18:21] blood because when you accept the blood
[18:24] of Jesus he puts you back in your
[18:26] original Condition You Are sinless you
[18:29] are spotless you are perfect somebody
[18:31] give God praise
[18:34] amen amen we walk around living defeated
[18:37] lives because we don't value the blood
[18:39] neither do we understand the power the
[18:41] cleansing power amen hallelujah there is
[18:45] power power wonderwork power in the
[18:49] Precious Blood of the Lamb amen maybe we
[18:52] need to bring some of the songs Back
[18:54] Amen to instill the truth to us amen the
[18:57] blood cleanses us amen yes puts us back
[19:00] in our original condition thank you Lord
[19:02] thank you Jesus amen amen amen it will
[19:06] never lose it
[19:11] power amen hallelujah thank you Lord now
[19:15] you must be born right to handle the
[19:18] place of adoption we read there right
[19:22] your birth must be right to come back to
[19:25] the place of adoption because before you
[19:28] get to full adoption what must there be
[19:30] you go to training you know all of this
[19:33] right you go to training but there must
[19:35] come a trial a
[19:37] test the test is to show because the
[19:40] tutor the trainer now must give a report
[19:43] back to Father yes and he must say
[19:46] whether you passed the test amen
[19:49] hallelujah the test is for promotion the
[19:51] test is not to bring you down the test
[19:53] is not Amen to make you fall amen
[19:56] hallelujah Satan TS you to make you fall
[19:58] but God puts you through a test like
[20:00] when you're going for a driver's license
[20:02] you study the first part you got your
[20:04] learners but then you must go to a
[20:06] physical test because the test is to
[20:08] make sure that you can really Drive amen
[20:12] otherwise you're going to kill people on
[20:14] the road and then they're going to blame
[20:17] you so they have a system where they put
[20:20] you through a test and the test is once
[20:23] you pass the test they promote you and
[20:25] they reward you with a
[20:27] license amen praise the Lord so God Amen
[20:31] remember now what I'm saying
[20:33] now you have to have the right birth
[20:36] before you are
[20:40] tried because the trial is for
[20:44] adoption praise the Lord amen you can't
[20:47] be born a Son of God and come out a son
[20:49] of Satan
[20:51] yes impossible the seed must reproduce
[20:55] itself amen amen hallelujah
[20:59] yes Lord your place of trying is only
[21:01] showing you that your birth was right
[21:04] amen let's look at Isaac for a
[21:06] second Isaac had the right
[21:08] [Music]
[21:10] birth he was not like ishma the wrong
[21:12] birth he had the right birth therefore
[21:15] he should go to his place of trying amen
[21:18] and willingly he laid down his life so
[21:21] that his father could get the reward of
[21:27] obedience you see there what I just told
[21:30] you I'm putting it from the perspective
[21:32] of Isaac Isaac had the right birth and
[21:36] he willingly laid down his life yes so
[21:39] that his
[21:40] father
[21:42] wonderful could
[21:45] receive amen hallelujah so the new
[21:49] that's the birth now remember right
[21:51] bedding ground was
[21:52] Sarah he had the right birth therefore
[21:55] in the place of shrine he could stand
[21:57] the test
[21:59] taken up on the mountain Carri the wood
[22:01] on his back amen going to the place
[22:04] laying himself down on the altar amen
[22:07] why he had the right birth amen yes amen
[22:11] praise the Lord thank you Lord amen look
[22:14] at Esau didn't have the right birth so
[22:17] he sold it out he sold his birth right
[22:21] amen hallelujah don't be a sellout don't

[22:28] You Are be birth in this hour amen
[22:30] hallelujah amen we heading to a point
[22:33] here amen praise the Lord so God sent
[22:36] the prophet Malachi 4 let's just read
[22:38] amen something here very
[22:40] quickly
[22:42] Hallelujah listen to why it's very
[22:44] important now for you to know your
[22:45] position in the message Christ is the
[22:47] mystery of God revealed he says if the
[22:49] church only knew its position do you
[22:51] know your position have we been
[22:53] preaching about your position amen then
[22:56] expect the next part if the church only
[22:58] it position it
[23:00] will one day I say this is the day amen
[23:04] the church knows a position then the
[23:06] Rapture will go when it knows what it
[23:10] is amen does anybody have a doubt what
[23:13] the church
[23:17] is amen he says look Christ in you makes
[23:20] him the center of life of the Revelation
[23:24] Christ lives in you makes him the center
[23:27] of the revelation amen Christ in the
[23:30] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[23:32] revelation of Christ Christ in you makes
[23:36] you swallow now Christ in you makes you
[23:42] the complete Revelation amen of the
[23:45] whole thing
[23:47] amen see what God is trying to do he
[23:51] goes on to say what is the new birth
[23:56] then you would say well brother Brandon
[23:58] what is the new birth it's the
[24:00] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[24:04] you am thank you am right I want you to
[24:08] understand this now because the
[24:11] Revelation the new birth is also a
[24:14] mystery and if you don't catch the
[24:16] revelation of it you will miss truths
[24:18] about it right so he's saying it's the
[24:22] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[24:26] you what is it it's Christ being
[24:29] revealed he is the word and when the
[24:32] word is revealed it expresses itself
[24:36] amen so you can receive the word but
[24:39] without
[24:43] expression you see it's you notice they
[24:45] in one in one sentence he explain the
[24:47] whole thing amen amen praise the lord
[24:50] it's revealed yes the prophet reveal the
[24:53] word but the word has
[24:55] expression
[24:57] amen if we shut off the expression then
[25:01] it's not going to be
[25:02] manifest it stop
[25:04] short that God's purpose for Jesus
[25:07] Christ was to express himself to take
[25:09] his own law and to live by his laws
[25:12] fulfill his law by death and Christ God
[25:15] died in the flesh in order to condemn
[25:17] sin in the flesh that he might bring to
[25:20] himself a glorious bride amen redeemed
[25:24] back that will believe only in the word
[25:26] of God and not swap it like Eve did for
[25:28] intellectual conceptions of men you see
[25:31] it that's Christ's idea that's God's
[25:33] idea the new birth reveals
[25:37] this amen so here the prophet says in
[25:40] the signs of his coming I will restore
[25:42] say the Lord what will I do I will bring
[25:44] her back to a original condition I will
[25:47] bring her back to her original Doctrine
[25:49] I will bring her back to the original
[25:51] word I will break every denomination to
[25:54] in pieces I will bring her back to my
[25:57] word how
[25:58] right he says maybe I better shut up
[26:01] stop boy I will bring it
[26:05] back amen because it's not for
[26:08] everybody amen praise the Lord
[26:10] hallelujah
[26:14] amen so we know that God sent this
[26:17] Prophet we just read he's going to bring
[26:18] you back to the original word God sent
[26:20] the prophet according to Malachi verse 5
[26:22] and six Amen to restore us back to the
[26:25] original Faith amen amen how many if you
[26:28] like genuine things
[26:31] amen how many if you go looking around
[26:33] for fake
[26:36] stuff amen the bride of Christ likes
[26:38] genuine things amen yes we like genuine
[26:42] Faith amen amen not counterfeit Faith
[26:45] but original Faith amen hallelujah we
[26:49] know that after our Lord Jesus Christ
[26:51] ascended to Heaven he came back to live
[26:54] and work in the apostles through the
[26:56] holy spirit amen the early church was a
[26:59] super
[27:00] Church they had the seed within them
[27:03] that was designed for that age yes in
[27:06] the genetics of that seed they could
[27:08] give their
[27:12] lives I if you know every seed carries a
[27:15] promise amen every seed carries a
[27:21] promise if the seed is planted it will
[27:24] bring and watered and in the right
[27:27] condition it will bring forth the
[27:29] promise if I gave you a mango seed and
[27:32] you plant a seed that seed has a
[27:35] promise that if you plant it in the
[27:38] right
[27:39] conditions in the right season it's
[27:42] going to give you the promise which is
[27:44] mangles
[27:47] amen everybody understand that every
[27:49] seed carries a promise are you a spoken
[27:52] word seed Son of God you carry a promise
[27:56] amen praise the Lord
[27:58] Hallelujah so the early church we said
[28:01] was a super Church they had a seed that
[28:03] was designed for that
[28:06] age it was the foundation of the
[28:09] [Music]
[28:11] church and they had a super
[28:14] anointing hallelujah amen amen the
[28:17] original faith is that you can see Jesus
[28:21] visible working before you they took
[28:24] took note that these men had been with
[28:27] Jesus it was a physical evidence that
[28:30] they had been with Jesus it was not a
[28:32] guess
[28:34] work because the science follow them
[28:36] that believed amen and Jesus Christ is
[28:38] the same yesterday today and forever
[28:41] amen if we are going back to the
[28:43] original Church these signs must follow
[28:46] the believer amen hallelujah amen yes
[28:48] praise the Lord yes amen if it doesn't
[28:51] do something that the original did it's
[28:53] not the original amen amen hallelujah
[28:56] maybe it was made to look like the
[28:58] original maybe it was shaked by men's
[29:00] Creeds and ideas to make it look like
[29:03] the
[29:03] original amen how many of you know that
[29:06] sometimes you see UPC women and you
[29:08] think one day if they are message women
[29:10] because they made to look like the
[29:12] original the prophet says that's he ask
[29:15] you look so much like the original and
[29:17] you'll think it's the seed but it's not
[29:19] the
[29:21] seed Hallelujah the original Faith you
[29:25] can see Jesus visible walking amongst us
[29:28] yeah you become what you're looking you
[29:30] know that what you behold is what you
[29:35] become amen amen hallelujah so we always
[29:38] keep Jesus before us and as we Behold
[29:41] Him we are being changed into his very
[29:44] own image and likeness amen hallelujah
[29:47] that we function like God Amen we have
[29:49] the character and nature of God amen
[29:52] amen so my point I'm trying to bring you
[29:55] to is that new your new birth could only
[29:57] come forth in this under this Faith
[30:00] under this word you were kept back for
[30:02] such a time and season as this to be
[30:04] birthed under the ministry of Malachi
[30:06] 4:5 and 6 behold I send
[30:10] you put your name there I'm sending you
[30:14] and within you you have a seed but only
[30:16] Malachi 4:5 and 6 has a Ministry amen
[30:20] that will identify that seed within
[30:24] you praise the Lord hey amen Revelation
[30:29] 10:7 Luke 17:30 amen your seed that you
[30:33] carry within you could not be planted in
[30:35] any other age with any other
[30:38] message you would have been out of time
[30:40] and out of
[30:42] season oh praise the Lord praise the
[30:45] Lord yes Hallelujah imagine if you were
[30:48] planted in Luther's
[30:51] age and Luther came out with
[30:55] justification and if you were planted in
[30:57] that you would be the fullness of the
[31:01] world so you couldn't be planted in that
[31:05] age praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen
[31:10] you couldn't be planted in the days of
[31:11] the early Apostles you couldn't give
[31:14] your life for the gospel because it was
[31:16] not encoded within your genetics within
[31:19] your seed it was not encoded there amen
[31:21] because within your seed you had other
[31:24] genetics over there within that seed
[31:26] they had a Lon anointing but imagine an
[31:28] eagle anointing being swed in a lion
[31:31] anointing wouldn't
[31:34] work Hallelujah so the seed had to be
[31:37] swn in the right time and the right
[31:39] season amen yes hallelujah amen praise
[31:42] the Lord amen oh praise the Lord amen so
[31:46] the seed must be planted in this age
[31:49] under this ministry amen under this
[31:52] fivefold ministry you have to come forth
[31:54] in the age under the word that's being
[31:56] presented to you
[31:58] we know that every seed is unique every
[32:00] seed brings forth up to its kind so God
[32:03] designed the seed amen hallelujah so
[32:05] that in it is locked up qualities in the
[32:08] seed is locked up potentials amen and
[32:11] you'll never know the potential of the
[32:13] seed until you plant the
[32:15] seed
[32:17] yes and you need the right
[32:20] environment to give it proper care you
[32:23] need Amen in order for the seed to
[32:25] prosper you must amen grow it in the
[32:28] right
[32:28] climate in the right season if you buy
[32:31] these seeds from the shop in the back of
[32:33] the packet they'll tell you when to
[32:35] plant the seed how much of sunlight it
[32:37] needs how to take care of the seed amen
[32:40] so some seeds only grow in certain
[32:43] conditions and certain
[32:46] climates the original spoken word seed
[32:49] cannot grow in a denominational climate
[32:52] doesn't feed it amen doesn't provide the
[32:54] nutrients it need doesn't provide
[32:57] sunlight
[32:58] because they are in Gross Darkness so a
[33:00] seed can't burst forth into life in a
[33:03] denominational Church it must be exposed
[33:06] to the ministry of Malachi 4:5 and 6 it
[33:09] must be birthed amen under Revelation
[33:12] 10:7 amen thank you praise the Lord they
[33:16] kick the light out of the church so no
[33:18] one can come to life in a denominational
[33:21] Church therefore Mama Eagle is crying
[33:23] out come out of there if you come out of
[33:26] there I can shine some light upon you
[33:29] amen come out of where my people be not
[33:31] partakers of our
[33:33] sins praise the
[33:35] Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[33:39] amen so when the seed is planted
[33:41] correctly in the right climate it
[33:44] receives enough sunlight enough water it
[33:46] begins to
[33:48] grow amen so what happens if you're in a
[33:50] church where the pastor denominates
[33:52] around an
[33:55] idea amen puts his own interpretation to
[33:58] the word what happens to your seed is it
[34:02] receiving the right kind of nutrients
[34:04] the right kind of moisture the right
[34:06] kind of
[34:07] sunlight amen hallelujah that's why the
[34:10] five form Ministry must stay in line the
[34:12] five form Ministry amen must be
[34:14] connected to the angel of God in this
[34:16] hour because there seeds of God that's
[34:18] going to be birth to life I'm not
[34:21] talking about ordinary Christian birth
[34:23] here I'm talking about being birth Amen
[34:26] to original Sons and Daughters of of God
[34:28] Amen if you want a normal denominational
[34:31] chicken birth amen there's enough
[34:32] sunlight in there amen fake light
[34:35] artificial light that they got in the
[34:37] chicken
[34:39] yards you go in there amen everything is
[34:42] dark and they got strobe lights for your
[34:46] chickens and you see them clacking
[34:49] around amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[34:54] amen you go there with an eagle scream
[34:55] and they're clacking amen praise the
[34:58] Lord you show them the truth of the
[35:00] scriptures and they go clck clck clck
[35:02] clck clck clck amen but an eagle screams
[35:06] out praise the Lord hallelujah amen
[35:10] whether the word is Grievous to them or
[35:11] not they say I'd rather take the word
[35:14] I'd rather repent and turn away
[35:17] Lord amen praise the Lord thank you Lord
[35:20] Oh Praise the Lord so proper is needed
[35:22] for your church amen hallelujah the
[35:24] didn't Jesus say except a corn of wheat
[35:27] amen
[35:28] dies goes into the ground he abided
[35:30] alone he says but if he dies and it's
[35:33] raising up again it brings forth much
[35:35] fruit amen so you find that in seed form
[35:39] you can't tell what it is if I gave you
[35:41] seeds here unless you're a
[35:46] master what they call you oldfashioned
[35:48] word is Gardener I don't know what they
[35:50] call them now Specialist of
[35:54] seeds they can tell you what seed this
[35:57] is I'm talking about say you had no
[35:59] study of seeds and I gave you a seed you
[36:02] would never know what seed it was till
[36:05] you planted it wait for it to come and
[36:08] grow all the way to the top and until it
[36:11] put forth
[36:12] fruit then you could tell me what kind
[36:15] of tree it was amen you see this is our
[36:18] time Hallelujah and every seed that was
[36:22] sown is now coming to full
[36:25] maturity Jesus said let them grow
[36:29] because a s went forth to seow but
[36:31] somebody sow tears Amongst the Wheat
[36:33] Jesus said don't go and pl it now lest
[36:35] you pluck up the wheat also so let it
[36:37] grow so they grew with the message
[36:40] church amen they rejoiced in the message
[36:43] Church they let songs in the message
[36:46] church amen they Rejoice about the
[36:49] coming of the Seven Angels they Rejoice
[36:51] about the cloud amen they even were so
[36:54] convicted and so convinced they printed
[36:56] T-shirts and said believe the
[37:01] signall they put up websites believe the
[37:05] sign until they got onto the grounds of
[37:10] reasoning
[37:12] amen and then they realize uhoh I was
[37:16] time in the presence of the sunlight I'm
[37:20] a
[37:21] tear so rather than tell everybody I'm a
[37:25] tear I'll attack them
[37:28] and say they are
[37:30] false just so that I don't get exposed
[37:33] that I am Mr
[37:35] tear amen so they left very quietly so
[37:39] they can go back to cutting their hair
[37:42] and going to places they shouldn't go
[37:45] yes and having some alcohol and going
[37:47] back to their
[37:50] lives you leave the message what message
[37:52] you going back to right amen what
[37:55] message what quality of life will you
[37:57] have correct amen amen you'll know
[38:00] you'll be condemned all your life
[38:02] because you'll know there's something
[38:03] better amen but unfortunately Jesus said
[38:08] those that were without wedding garments
[38:09] must be kicked out amen so even if they
[38:12] wanted to stay they couldn't stay
[38:15] because let me tell you you got plucked
[38:20] outall so when you see them next time
[38:23] tell them how does plucking out
[38:26] feel
[38:28] how does it feel to be pled
[38:31] out amen praise the
[38:34] Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord
[38:36] must be
[38:38] painful because when you pluck one a out
[38:40] you know how painful it is it plucked
[38:43] out and Jesus didn't leave Roots there
[38:45] when he plucked he plucked him by the
[38:49] roots that's why they were
[38:52] crying amen praise the Lord
[38:55] amen so you got to leave it for hours
[38:58] time when the seed is fully mature when
[39:00] it comes back to the fruit you'll know
[39:01] what type of seed fruit it is amen so we
[39:04] know that the angel of God comes at the
[39:07] time of
[39:08] life
[39:11] hallelujah praise the Lord the time of
[39:14] life is the season for the birthing of
[39:16] original
[39:17] Sons and Daughters of God who carry the
[39:20] DNA of God Amen praise the Lord and the
[39:24] faith that's required for this hour is
[39:26] perfect faith
[39:28] amen so God sent a word in the time of
[39:31] life to Quicken the seed that's within
[39:33] you to germinate your life because you
[39:37] carry within you the secret of the
[39:39] mystery of God being revealed yes am do
[39:41] we not just read there you carry the
[39:43] complete
[39:47] Revelation praise the Lord God wants to
[39:50] have the preeminence in your body God
[39:52] wants to adopt you and place
[39:55] you not only God want to do that all
[39:58] creation is
[40:00] groaning yes praise the Lord God wants
[40:04] to have the preeminence you have unique
[40:06] qualities about you amen you are able to
[40:09] receive the word for your
[40:11] age praise the Lord amen you are able to
[40:15] receive the message of the hour ask
[40:17] yourself how come others can't receive
[40:19] the message of the hour how come others
[40:21] reject the message of the hour but for
[40:23] you it's like music to your ears amen
[40:26] amen
[40:27] hallelujah praise the
[40:32] Lord how come you can say be unto me
[40:35] according to your word now you know
[40:37] human reasoning can step
[40:39] in right but watch how the holy spirit
[40:43] will come to answer your
[40:47] questions questions are
[40:49] okay because the holy spirit is the
[40:52] dissolver of all doubts amen because
[40:54] when the angel what did I I just told
[40:56] you the angel come at the time of
[40:58] life amen praise the Lord 4,000 years
[41:03] had passed since the Genesis prophecy
[41:06] and it was now the time of life to bring
[41:08] to pass Isaiah
[41:10] 7 everybody understand the angel of God
[41:12] comes to Mary the angel always comes at
[41:15] the time of life
[41:18] amen amen I'm saying it again and you
[41:21] say a better amen the angel always comes
[41:24] at the time of
[41:25] life Hallelujah so he comes to Mary and
[41:29] he says Mary you are blessed and highly
[41:31] favored amongst all women amen and he
[41:34] tells her the plan she asked a question
[41:38] how can it be seeing that I have no man
[41:42] I know no
[41:43] man so you see there very quickly you
[41:47] can see there was a question there was a
[41:53] thought what is that the human
[41:56] reasoning but the angel comes to
[41:59] dissolve all doubts and says the Holy
[42:01] Ghost shall overshadow you amen and you
[42:05] shall have a son amen
[42:07] amen that seemed
[42:10] impossible but what he was really doing
[42:13] was answering Eve's
[42:16] question how shall I have a
[42:21] son Adam was supposed to speak the word
[42:24] amen and Mary
[42:27] having the authority on the earth
[42:29] connects with the Angel's message and
[42:31] gives him the authority to use her body
[42:34] she says be it unto me according to Thy
[42:36] word amen amen praise the Lord
[42:41] hallelujah so you're like Mary you don't
[42:44] doubt any word of God Amen how many if
[42:47] you can testify I love the word of God
[42:49] Amen Let me see your hands I love the
[42:51] word of God Amen praise the Lord amen I
[42:54] love the word of God you are not
[42:56] fighting with the Holy SP
[42:57] spirit amen how of you fighting with the
[42:59] holy spirit amen some of you saying I
[43:02] want to be like Jacob let me fight the
[43:04] Holy Spirit you're wrestling with the
[43:07] Holy Spirit you're wrestling with the
[43:09] holy spirit amen amen amen you keep
[43:12] wrestling amen hallelujah you know what
[43:14] he's going to do he's going to touch you
[43:16] one of these days your walk will even
[43:18] change amen
[43:19] hallelujah Jacob's walk changed
[43:23] yes after the Angel's touch yes am amen
[43:28] praise the Lord You're not fighting with
[43:31] the Holy Spirit but you are co-workers
[43:33] with the holy spirit amen hallelujah you
[43:36] submit and surrender to the will of the
[43:38] Father the word that is within you is
[43:40] becoming stronger and more visible until
[43:42] you are the very image and the life of
[43:44] Jesus Christ your character and your
[43:47] nature is like your father you are a
[43:49] masterpiece but you're also a piece of
[43:52] the master amen so remember another type
[43:56] now to show you the point the angel
[43:58] comes at the time of
[44:01] life Genesis 18 doesn't the angel come
[44:04] at the time of life to Sarah the angel
[44:08] always comes at the time of
[44:10] life and 28 is a number representing the
[44:14] time of life amen therefore it came on
[44:18] the 28th of February and it was remain
[44:21] sunlet for about the space of half an
[44:23] hour which was 28
[44:25] minutes hey amen amen hallelujah praise
[44:29] the Lord what was that showing us the
[44:31] time of
[44:32] life now just in these two examples I
[44:36] showed you the angel coming to two women
[44:38] coming to Sarah coming to Eve so is the
[44:42] angel in Revelation 10 coming to another
[44:47] woman Hallelujah yes coming to another
[44:50] woman because this woman must produce an
[44:53] original son again amen yes amen
[44:57] Hallelujah so like Sarah you have to you
[44:59] have to have faith now remember you can
[45:01] walk for many years in the message don't
[45:04] think I'm preaching an ordinary message
[45:05] now you can walk for many years in the
[45:08] message and be obedient like Sarah she
[45:11] left the land of her birth and she
[45:14] followed
[45:16] Abraham now remember Abraham when I
[45:18] every time I say Abraham you think of
[45:20] our messenger
[45:22] Bram right she left denominations to
[45:25] follow Abraham amen praise the Lord amen
[45:29] so she what did she do she left the
[45:31] place of her first
[45:33] birth and she followed Abraham and came
[45:36] to a new
[45:39] land yet she was not moving in perfect
[45:42] Faith so she had a certain amount of
[45:45] Faith to follow Abraham but she didn't
[45:47] have perfect
[45:49] Faith
[45:51] yes amen she was looking to the flesh we
[45:54] were looking to the Flesh and too
[45:56] focused on Natural Things amen still

[51:36] angered you are not frustrated but you
[51:38] have been built up with Temperance and
[51:40] patience oh
[51:45] yes so you can't be reborn until the
[51:48] angel
[51:50] comes to your full potential oh yes
[51:54] prior to that you are walking in faith
[51:57] but the angel comes to bring perfect
[51:58] Faith the angel brought perfect Faith to
[52:01] Mary the angel brought perfect Faith to
[52:03] Sarah the angel brings perfect Faith to
[52:05] an end time
[52:09] people
[52:14] amen let's get to the core of what I'm
[52:16] trying to say here
[52:18] now
[52:20] justification was a
[52:22] seed lther had a seed within
[52:25] him and when the Holy Ghost
[52:29] fell remember Luther developed to his
[52:33] full
[52:35] potential Luther didn't go off the scene
[52:38] not having completed the work that God
[52:41] had for him
[52:44] yes understand what I am
[52:48] saying the prophet says justification
[52:50] made a way for
[52:52] sanctification and sanctification made a
[52:54] way for the Holy Ghost
[52:57] but when the Holy Ghost fell in
[53:02] 1906 it fell on a
[53:05] seed that at its full
[53:08] maturity could only produce the
[53:10] restoration of the gifts
[53:16] yes which
[53:18] means that was all that the seed could
[53:21] produce and the Holy Ghost can only
[53:23] birth what's in your seed amen yeah
[53:28] amen you know the prophet is talking
[53:30] about this in stock tessel
[53:32] ask three stages there he says but
[53:35] there's another
[53:37] stage praise the
[53:39] Lord so Wesley seed could not be planted
[53:42] under this climate and
[53:46] condition can you imagine Wesley seed
[53:48] being planted in this time and this
[53:51] season this is another age you know the
[53:55] prophet there's many quotes I don't have
[53:56] time to go into it what does he say
[53:58] Moses message won't work today amen
[54:02] other Messengers messages won't work
[54:04] today he says this is another age yes
[54:06] this is another season amen so Luther's
[54:09] message won't work today because we have
[54:12] Luther's message plus Wesley's message
[54:15] alone won't work today because we have
[54:18] Luther's Wesley's message plus yes the
[54:21] restoration of the gifts won't work
[54:23] today because we have justification
[54:26] sanctification restoration of the gifts
[54:28] and we gone into a plus amen amen
[54:34] yes I'll say this again the Holy Ghost
[54:37] can only birth the seed that's within
[54:39] you so what kind of seed do we have God
[54:43] has planted a bright tree and he's been
[54:46] restoring the three tree through three
[54:48] stages I will restore say the Lord
[54:50] justification sanctification baptism of
[54:53] the Holy Ghost amen now listen to Just
[54:56] that statement baptism of the holy ghost
[55:00] sounds like the real
[55:03] thing doesn't it justification
[55:06] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:09] you'll think there's no other stage
[55:11] beside that but watch what the baptism
[55:13] of the Holy Ghost
[55:15] produced it only produced the gifts back
[55:18] in the
[55:21] church praise the
[55:23] Lord amen so from 1906 6 to
[55:28] 1946 the Holy Spirit God was looking for
[55:31] a ripen
[55:34] seed that could
[55:36] bring adoption to the
[55:40] age what's 1906 you say 1906 was zza was
[55:45] the restoration of the
[55:48] gifts but it only produced restoration
[55:51] of the gifts so from 1906 to 1946 how
[55:55] many years is
[55:58] that 40 1906 to 1946 does it sound like
[56:04] Moses 40 years then connects with the
[56:08] angel come on now amen first Exodus he's
[56:12] 40 years in Egypt after 40 years he
[56:17] leaves goes to meet the angel of God in
[56:20] the pillar of
[56:22] fire Hallelujah 1906 to 1946 another 40
[56:27] years 1946 what happens angel of God
[56:30] comes down meets him in a
[56:33] cave praise the
[56:35] Lord so God is looking for a man who can
[56:38] birth the adoption
[56:43] age amen praise the
[56:46] Lord God can only find one man that he
[56:49] can call to the
[56:52] adoption so he starts to use this one
[56:55] man amen
[57:00] amen I ask you how many in this age can
[57:03] God call to the
[57:06] adoption amen praise the Lord Amen
[57:08] brother brandham was a ripen seed son
[57:10] who knew the denominations you'll find
[57:12] this throughout these messages now
[57:14] blasting denominations he knew that
[57:16] denominations were following their own
[57:18] interpretation of the word they were did
[57:21] not have the original revealed word so
[57:23] he told us that the only way to know
[57:25] what the true church is and what the
[57:27] seed is in them is to judge them by the
[57:29] word amen he said give them the word
[57:31] test yes then you'll know what kind of
[57:33] seed is within them they will respond to
[57:35] the word amen hallelujah because the
[57:38] word produces the right
[57:42] environment for the seed the word
[57:45] produces the right kind of f to Quicken
[57:47] the seed and it Waters the seed and burs
[57:50] it and brings it forth so you can come
[57:52] forth in this
[57:55] time now here what I'm saying in a
[57:57] nutshell the Holy Ghost falling in
[57:59] Luther's day could only birth that seed
[58:02] as far as
[58:03] justification they couldn't go any
[58:05] higher in that
[58:06] age because out of justification came
[58:09] Wesley now Wesley continued with the
[58:13] growth and the Holy Ghost fell upon
[58:17] Wesley and the Holy Ghost brought forth
[58:19] Wesley's seed to its full potential with
[58:23] the message of
[58:25] sanctification
[58:27] and from sanctification the Holy Ghost
[58:30] fell on Aza Street and brought it to
[58:33] their full
[58:35] potential restoration of the
[58:39] gifts and he couldn't move any further
[58:42] because each one of those Messengers
[58:45] messages denominated they denominated
[58:48] around justification you still find
[58:50] lutherans they denominated around wsans
[58:52] you'll still find them today
[58:54] sanctification they denominated out of
[58:57] restoration of the gifts now speaking in
[58:59] tongues is one of the gifts but they put
[59:02] it as the initial
[59:03] evidence even now they'll say unless you
[59:06] speak in tongues you don't have the Holy
[59:08] Ghost right so that was not the final
[59:12] outpouring of the Holy
[59:14] Ghost so how can they come to adopted
[59:21] Sons amen praise the
[59:25] Lord
[59:26] only seed can be reborn the prophet says
[59:29] so how will you know if your seed give
[59:31] it the word test any seed must be
[59:33] planted must die and when that seed
[59:35] germinates to life you're able to see
[59:37] the growth of that seed so follow the
[59:40] life of the seed all the way to the
[59:42] fruit and you will see what kind of seed
[59:44] it was amen the Holy Ghost was birthing
[59:47] the seed of Luther amen and the fruit of
[59:50] Luther produced
[59:51] justification amen the Holy Ghost was
[59:53] birthing the seed of Wesley and the amen
[59:56] the fruit that wle produced for
[59:58] sanctification the Holy Ghost amen
[1:00:00] birthed the seed of Aza Street Revival
[1:00:04] and it produce the outpouring of the
[1:00:06] holy spirit that brought back the gifts
[1:00:08] to the
[1:00:11] church let's just go to a quote very
[1:00:13] quickly I'm going to show you what the
[1:00:14] prophet is saying here amen praise the
[1:00:16] Lord amen amen
[1:00:24] hallelujah
[1:00:27] let's go to uh
[1:00:29] the the Masterpiece
[1:00:33] amen praise the
[1:00:41] Lord you got it there 134 starts
[1:00:53] off he says now notice here the life
[1:00:55] that was in the stalk tessel all now
[1:00:58] ends up in the seed the life has come
[1:01:00] out of the original seed come up through
[1:01:02] different
[1:01:03] processes then turns back till it's
[1:01:06] original again right I'm sure I'm just
[1:01:09] trying to show you all that I've been
[1:01:10] preaching now is in the quotes and the
[1:01:13] life that was in the stock went one went
[1:01:16] to make the other justification made a
[1:01:18] way for sanctification sanctification
[1:01:20] made a way for baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:22] Holy Ghost amen made a way for the holy
[1:01:25] now watch
[1:01:27] made a way for the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:28] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made
[1:01:31] a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come
[1:01:34] right down in Perfection back to the
[1:01:36] word again to manifest itself amen yes
[1:01:41] that's why we are not like the
[1:01:42] Pentecostal Church they had the
[1:01:44] restoration of the gifts but we got the
[1:01:46] Holy Ghost itself
[1:01:48] amen right it says what denominated dies
[1:01:52] like life in Luther went to make Wesley
[1:01:54] and from Wesley it went to Pentecost
[1:01:55] from from Pentecost to make the Original
[1:01:57] Seed onto Pentecost comes out of Wesley
[1:02:00] until that time so he's saying the same
[1:02:01] things again
[1:02:04] amen okay let's go to paragraph 140
[1:02:09] then stalk tessel ask living they
[1:02:12] produced in the early Revival a holder
[1:02:14] of a certain portion of their seed life
[1:02:17] but when they organized the life moved
[1:02:19] out of it Watch The Life is traveling on
[1:02:22] now it's moving on that life leaves a
[1:02:24] stalk to make the tassel from the tassel
[1:02:26] it makes the As and from the as it goes
[1:02:28] into the original grain it goes on to
[1:02:30] its
[1:02:31] Perfection
[1:02:33] amen now here we are we're trying to get
[1:02:36] to now at the Harvest Time the seed is
[1:02:38] back to its original condition and must
[1:02:40] have all of the word in order to be the
[1:02:43] seed now you can't have half a seed it
[1:02:45] won't grow it's got to be the whole seed
[1:02:48] it's got to it's got to not manifest I
[1:02:51] believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:53] Hallelujah I believe in speaking in
[1:02:55] tongues that's just part of the seed but
[1:02:58] now there's added to that amen you see
[1:03:01] what I was saying I was preaching it but
[1:03:02] now I'm showing you the quotes amen
[1:03:05] added to that here's what I'm trying to
[1:03:08] get to the life not the gifts the life
[1:03:12] of the gifts see what I mean we are at
[1:03:15] the end time Brethren so we are after
[1:03:18] The
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:20] Life what does the life produce the life
[1:03:23] puts us back in Dominion again amen so
[1:03:27] the gifts look
[1:03:29] temporary because when you're in your
[1:03:31] rightful position you're a God of the
[1:03:34] Earthen you don't need to be a Gifted
[1:03:36] Man you're back in original condition
[1:03:39] amen praise the Lord so stock Tel ask is
[1:03:43] dead and dry now but I like to
[1:03:45] fellowship with them he's dead and dry
[1:03:48] now I like dead and
[1:03:53] dry he dead and dry now

[1:03:59] happen to that is to be gathered in the
[1:04:01] world Council of churches for

[1:04:25] seed again the seed that fell in the
