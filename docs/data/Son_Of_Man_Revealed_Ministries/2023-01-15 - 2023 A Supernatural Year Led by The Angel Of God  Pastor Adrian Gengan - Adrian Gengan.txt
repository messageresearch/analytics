of the Lord amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord in spite of the uneasiness and the humidity amen but we come to serve him amen I know I often make that statement that we are with the Christians we don't care whether it's hot whether it's cold whether it's snowing amen but we serve the Lord amen I like to greet every one of you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen welcome you in the house of the Lord amen we also have our brother amen that's visiting with us this morning with a Renault am I saying their name properly no amen so he stays down in green Manner and obey the spirit of the Lord let him here he said his mother and his father told him there's a church here so he should come amen but I don't believe things happen just happened as a amen because we believe in the leading of the angel of God and I appreciate the morning prayer brother Sunny amen the angel of the Lord is still here on the Earth right now and you'll see some of the things where why I'm saying that is you'll see our message is going to be centered around that amen we appreciate the song service we appreciate the singers amen I noticed you were flowing uh in a good spirit and anointing this morning and that's a good atmosphere for the spirit of God to move Amen brother Gans is here this morning let's keep my hand welcoming amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen so brother salvation and his family is still away and they should be back this week amen pray the Lord will give them a safe traveling buses amen coming back home amen so we'll turn our attention to Exodus chapter 23. amen Exodus chapter 23 . the message will start on 23. amen so we're going to be looking at amen a few things in the scripture and in Exodus chapter 23 reading from verse 20 I just want to read a quote before we get into that okay you can give me that back our words foreign amen Exodus chapter 23 and verse 20. it says behold I send an angel before thee who is the Lord talking to you Moses right the Lord is talking to Moses and he's telling him behold I send an angel before thee now very important to note what he's going to tell him number one he's going to keep thee in the way now if I'd ask you who was the deliverer in the first Exodus you will tell me it's Moses but here we see that Moses the deliverer is being led by an Angel and the Lord is telling him behold you can pick it up in your scriptures Exodus chapter 23 and verse 20. amen to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared so whose job is it to bring them from Egypt to the promised land is it Moses job or is it the Angel's job so the angel is going to keep him in the way the angel is going to bring thee into the place which I have prepared aren't you glad he said I'm going away to prepare a place for you and there's an angel leading us to take a place just beware amen Beware of the angel amen amen right there's two ways you can read that beware of him and then be cautious or be aware of him and you know from the news if service the spirit has been leading us and telling us to be more sensitive to the spirit of God and the angel of God that is leading the church so be aware of him obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions all verse 5 said I mean the fifth point there is for my name is in him [Music] which do you say I came anybody knows that a name represents character that's why the prophet is telling us watch what you name your children it represents their character amen and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Mighty God fruits of peace this Angel is going to have that same characteristics are you reading with understanding 22 says but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries note 23 23 now make this 20 so Exodus 20 23 is your scripture for the year for my angel shall go before thee amen and bring thee unto the amorites the e-tites the peasal rights the Canaanites the invites the jebusites and all the other pornographic sites and all the other websites so he's going to deliver you from the rights the tights the sights the knights the whites and the sights he's going to deliver you from all of these things amen may the Lord have blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen oh isn't he a good God give him praise amen I know you're feeling uncomfortable where you are right now for those of you streaming in it's extremely hot here in Durban South Africa today and uh but we're just going to bear with the Heat this morning amen hallelujah aren't you glad that we serve a God and he gave us his glorious message amen such a prophetic word amen why would we want to be out in some denominational Church when we are living in the glory of his word amen Caleb I'm going to give you this back and then you can just see if you can pick that up amen so I want to say this morning that this is no ordinary Church this ministry sorry one said amen watching you amen this ministry is designed Supernatural amen and when you are caught up into a spiritual Supernatural atmosphere it's going to overflow into the natural it will affect everything about your natural life and that's the true meaning behind Matthew 6 and 33 when Jesus is saying seek ye first the kingdom of God no no the kingdom is not natural the kingdom is Supernatural spiritual he says when you seek the spiritual Kingdom and his righteousness all the things in natural shall be added unto you so we are those Ministry is designed to lead you into the supernatural spiritual things of God you've come just looking for a natural church for church membership this is not the place to be amen because you will be grieved by the things that the spirit of God is speaking the spirit of God will make you feel uncomfortable so the ministry is designed to connect you to the supernatural world and then you will live gloriously in the natural the demand should pick it up amen all right it's fine maybe you can pick up the quote I want to read this brother Brandon is saying yeah and he's talking about Exodus 23 and 23 he says I usually read this at the starting of your Revival there you go because this deals with something the way God is dealing today amen amen it's dealing with the way God is dealing today Exodus 23 and 23 I send my angel before thee amen now what were the children of Israel why did they need Deliverance they were in Egypt and as long as they were prospering under Joseph and the next 400 years they had need of nothing and went along living life just fine but that got away from God and that's the trouble in man they got in trouble with God and they got under bondage and they came a great need a great persecution that they had to endure to drive them to see God again now there's a lesson to be learned right there because we live in the midst of leadership the most lukewarm and cold Church age that there ever is but it's also the most easiest age to live life amen you can become anything in this life if you put your time your effort your discipline and you can live a comfortable life but what will it profit a man if he gains the old world Amen and he loses his soul amen and the nature of man has not changed if we are not converted if we are not born again all of us have this nature as long as things are easy man does not seek after God amen man always wants to call out to God and cry out to him only in the time of trouble but I pray him and there won't be the wind with us this morning amen may we always seek the Lord amen may we always call out to him when times are good when times are bad through sickness when we are in good health in times of financial prosperity and even when economic times are tough may we never lose weight or belief in God Amen amen may we be steadfast to him how many times have we spoken about job and don't we sing that song Blessed Be Your Name amen when I'm found in the desert place though I walk through the Wilderness no matter the circumstance find a place where you can praise God no matter how difficult to test still testify still sing to him amen most people say oh no I'm not feeling good I feel down in my spirit I cannot praise the Lord that's the right time to praise him Amen in the midst of your circumstance praise the Lord and watch the devil begin to tremble because he cannot stand to see a Believer rise up in faith he'll say no matter what I'm putting through this Christian through he is still praising God he wanted job to curse God amen now we serve a mighty God we serve a powerful God amen can you testify to that this morning we serve a God who is worthy of praise and a true worshiper does not worship God according to circumstances amen a true worship God does not worship amen God Less in trouble times but in fact he increases his level of praise and his level of worship in troubled times amen Hallelujah a true revelation of God will make you worship Him in spirit and in truth amen amen amen now you're the prophet of God says when God's prophetic time comes to pass after he promised Abraham that his seed with sojourn in his Strange Land for 400 years he would bring them out by strong hand he says no matter how impossible it seems that it will not be when the time of the promise draws nigh God will make things eat up to foot his prophetic promise amen I didn't give you my title this morning the title for my sermon is 2023 and my focus is on 23. It's Supernatural here led by the angel of God and I'm going to show you how 23s associated with the angel of God amen 23 is associated with the angel of God we read Exodus 20. now for those Skeptics who are saying oh no why are you making these things up Exodus 23 and 23. my angel shall go before thee wasn't it God who designed man to write the Bible wasn't it God who made them so meticulously number it accordingly otherwise how can we fathom Revelation 10 7. that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound you know that sounding was the sounding of a trumpet a jubilee trumpet to let man go free and on the tenth day of the seventh month he laid down the law and Leviticus and he told him in the tenth day of the seventh month you shall call the trumpet to be blown so God is accurate in the way numbers things amen so he makes it as 23 and 23 my angels shall go before thee amen hallelujah and I told you we're going to be looking at some of these things and show you how the number 23 is associated with the angel of the Lord and what year are we living in 2023 I declare that this year shall be a shift in the church there'll be a shift in and a move towards the supernatural things of God you become more aware of the angel of God you become more aware of his presence and his Supernatural walking amongst the Believers of course that only applies to the ones that are expecting it if you remain in a natural you will not see the move of God but if you are on the expectation this morning amen you shall see the supernatural moving of the spirit of God live and take a switch it's me deals with the seven Feasts what are the seven feasts given for it's all typing Christ it's typing Christ's sacrifice amen and we have lived amen Christ typed the first three trees amen and you know the fourth Feast was the Feast of Pentecost and there's been 50 years amen a jubilee a Pentecostal feast amen hallelujah I will show you amen that amen this feast day is the past and then the prophet wants to preach Feast of the trumpets he wants to lay out seven days and preach Feast of the trumpets but then he cannot do it because the spirit of God tells him you already preached the trumpets supernaturally under the Sixth Seal so watch what happened supernaturally now and the prophet himself does not even explain this because the last three Feasts is the Feast of atonement amen sorry the Feast of trumpets the Feast of atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles and yet he preaches three consecutive Sundays the first message he takes is fear the Feast of the trumpets right the second message he takes is recognizing your day and its message which is what's going to happen to the Jews recognizing the atonement there are three more fees left for them now we know six trumpets have already sounded right the property has six trumpets rushed him to the Homeland they are waiting for the seven trumpet which will be under the ministry of Moses and Elijah can somebody say Amen amen hallelujah now you're going to be spiritual to catch these things some some of these things may go over your head otherwise but watch how the prophet the spirit leads the prophet to preach Feast of the trumpets one Sunday the following Sunday he preaches recognizing your day and its message like how the Jews are going to recognize the atonement the one they rejected was the true atonement we the denominational world have rejected the message but we have recognized our day and its message and then the third message which is typing Feast of the Tabernacles or Feast of boots so what did they do in that Feast they made temporary Dwelling Places even up to today they do these temporary dwelling they call it boots it's signifying a move from the this world into the next world and then the prophet preaches the third Sunday the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he preaches his messages supernaturally led by the angel of God Amen amen showing us that we have received it spiritually amen amen hallelujah and aren't you thankful it's a Heavenly bridegroom coming to an Earthly bride what is he doing he's gonna take an ugly bride away into another world he is the architect of that world he is the designer of that world amen and watch our signs now in the natural where do they want to take man because they are trying to copy God don't they want to take man out of this world and try and find another Dwelling Place that is the more motive behind it amen because Satan is a copycat Hallelujah now we're just going to hit some highlights Exodus 23 and 23 was the angel leading Moses but what did he say I will take you into the land now did Moses take them into the land who took them into the land so it's the same angel I hope you picked this up Moses was The Exodus Prophet now the same angel that started the ministry in Moses is the same one leading them in Joshua the same Ministry that started out in William Branham is the same Angel leading the church today Hallelujah and watch out supernaturally now the spirit of God would take Joshua 23 on New Year's Eve and I didn't know that still I Was preparing for last night that Joshua 23 . amen are we speaking about 23 being associated with the angel of God Joshua coming to the end of his ministry now he's telling us what did the prophet says Joshua types the end time leader leading them into the promised land what is the promised land the land of the Holy Ghost and he gathers all the elders together and he tells them hey you possess so much of the land but I've mapped out the rest of the land go on to possess it who's going to lead them now the angel of God Joshua 23 . amen the same one that started in Moses he's the same one working in the Joshua Ministry he's now commissioning them to continue possessing the land and to go on to claim all of the inheritance or I could show you Three Angels message in Revelation 10 right now there's the mighty angel the same angel that I'm talking about amen the angel of the Covenant comes to commission the seventh angel amen hallelujah and then there's another John Deere typing the bride with the last commission that must prophesy again amen and all of us know Psalm 23 what is Psalm 23 about the Lord is my shepherd [Music] make this your sound for the year the Lord is my shepherd what are we speaking about the angel leaving the church Psalm 23 speaks about and you know the prophet tells us the angel of the Covenant was Christ himself so the Lord is Our Shepherd he's the one leading us I shall not want amen let's read it the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want let's read it together he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leaded me beside the Still Waters He restored my soul he leaded me in the paths of righteousness for his name sin yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fulfill no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy stuff they comfort me God prepare us a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointed my head with oil my cup run it over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen did you catch that the angel of God is going to lead you from the natural into the house of the Lord Supernatural the house of the Lord is not natural how many of you know David was a prophet amen David was a prophetic writer but he was no priest David was prophet and King but we had one Prophet priest and King the Lord Jesus Christ amen how many of you are following me this morning amen hallelujah we're coming now into the New Testament and Luke 23 remember what we've been speaking about now the spirit of the Lord is leading there now what did they have in the first Exodus they had a natural lamb that was slain the blood of the Lamb was applied on the doorpost in the second Exodus they had the true lamb they had the blood of the lamb and in Luke 23 deals with the crucifixion of that lamb the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ the turning point in Humanity's history the ultimate sacrifice for the sin of mankind is found in Luke 23 and it was he was offered and he was sacrificed once and for all and an atonement was made and through the blood of Jesus Christ you and I are set free you and I are no longer bound and he whom the son of man has set free he is free indeed amen Hallelujah the angel led him all the way to the cross amen Hallelujah and that was the last Bleak gloomy day for mankind man would never have to be dark and gloomy again because on that Resurrection Sunday brought a promise of New Life amen the Glorious King of Kings rose again on that Sunday morning and he brought a promise to the church he said I'm going away but I'm going to send you the comforter the angel of God is going to lead you and guide you amen oh I know it's hot I know it's hard for you to concentrate right now but pay attention amen Hallelujah don't miss it because amen this service depends on how you're going to finish this year amen this is going to be the most glorious year for the church this is going to be the most Supernatural here for the church amen or the first messenger of the first age the Apostle Paul [Music] let's turn to Acts 27. and oddly enough what verse do you think it's found in who's following me the 23rd verse of Acts 27 . what does he say for they are stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve d do you think that's coincidence Exodus 23 23 talking about an angel leading the church acts 27 and 23 they stood now this was give you context he remember the ship was going to go down the Apostle Paul is telling them they stood by me an angel of God whose I am amen so who is this angel that the Apostle Paul wants to be associated with him and he's saying who am I serve the angel of the Covenant the one leading the church the prophet we don't have time to go into it now he says people think that the angel doesn't leave the church anymore he says come to find out I'll show you in the scripture and then he takes him throughout the angel let Philip the angel LED Paul Peter the angel LED Paul we went through that a few months ago when we preached on the wings of the mighty Angel and we showed you how the angel was leading the church that was first Exodus right Exodus 23 23 here's the second Exodus Jesus Christ Angel of the church Angel leading the church and you're starting off the first church age Paul the Apostle Paul telling us the angel of God was with him leading him confirming the angel is leading the church now watch what the prophet says he says go to a Moses I'm going to send an angel before you to keep you in the way he said I love that now anyone knows that that angel that met Moses or guided Moses was the angel of the Covenant which was Jesus Christ the pillar of fire and he's the same yesterday today and forever it's the same Angel leading the church today LED that one dead thank you now let's just jump forward amen I'm trying to be mindful you know humans are something that if they feel uncomfortable they're not going to pay attention amen so I'm trying to be mindful I'm trying to keep you focused this morning amen the prophet of God in his second marriage he told Mida to go and pray about it you remember that she wasn't sure and he wasn't sure so he told her to go pray about it and he said I'll pray about it as well so she goes to pray about it and the Lord gives America the old I send you Elijah the prophet and what did the prophet tell her he said the Lord told me to marry you on October 20 third saying are you playing around with numbers this morning why did the angel of the Lord tell brother Branham to get married October 23rd now I'm sure most of you don't know this this morning why October 23rd is a very significant date in the creation of the Earth the prophet in in the message 70 weeks of Daniel to find this in paragraph 195 you make a note of this in the message 70 weeks of Daniel is referencing a writer by the name of Usher and he makes reference to Ash's chronology and he's telling you how they had 1954 years that God dealt with the Jews that's the only point I want to get to that the prophet is referencing Usher so who is Asha amen everybody feeling okay Asha lived in the 17th century and he used the Bible to pinpoint the first day of world's creation and using the Bible and you know the Bible has dates and would pinpoint accuracy he says the first day of creation was October 23rd 4004 before Christ right so four thousand and four years before Christ and watch how accurately he predicted it is because we believe that the Earth is six thousand years old come on now we believe that the Earth is 6 000 years old or creation since creation started amen now why would the Lord tell him get married on that day October 23rd if it did not carry a significance amen then you know what happened on October 23rd he was having a moment in the wilderness and he was remembering his wife because it was the anniversary you'll find this in the message of the guide and while he is remembering her he said he sits down and he says he looks before him and he sees he's changed he turns back young again how many of you know the testimony he said he was sitting there in virgin Timber he turned back young again is that coincidence I'll leave you with one more thought before we continue you can go and do the math on this it's 2023 and we know the shortest search Angels when shortest churches 117 years everybody agree when did this church Aid start approximately 1906. you're gonna do your math I'm asking you have you made yourself ready could this be the year where God will finish up walking with the Gentiles could this be the year that the Lord is going to lead the church into the third port I'm talking about the supernatural I'm talking about where she left that said the Lord is everybody with me or if you're not with me amen you can leave we're looking for a supernatural Church we are preparing people for a Rapture amen amen lots of churches around the corner you want a church program or do you want to go in a reaction do you want to be prepared to see your lord and savior Jesus is coming soon how many times have you heard eventually screened that out Jesus is coming soon could this be the year the year the world enters a World War could this be the year they changed popes could this be the year then everything comes to its climax we don't know but watch and pray we're trying to keep you in Readiness of the hour God moves in times and Seasons doesn't he amen hallelujah I want to leave this with you do you know that every time in your natural cycle as well you know if you've gone extremely bulky I'll use the word bulky right the other word for it is fat okay come on somebody smile amen they tell you you need to change your diet and how long did they give you they say you must do this diet for how long don't they say three months 90 days nobody agrees three times four is twelve twelve weeks how many of you seen most diets tell you 12 weeks three months 90 days come on people how many of you have seen that I know you only read the message books how many of you just stumble across it somewhere what is three months if not I see what are they they're working according to a law because the Bible says in Ecclesiastes to everything there is a season what is a season three months then if the Bible is saying to everything there is a season and if you are going through something more than three months ask yourself why if there's not been a turnaround in that situation you either have not your lunch or less than you are not listening to God so God is keeping you in a prolonged season whether it's a season of sickness poverty whatever it is I mean if you want to walk by biblical laws this year and biblical principles the Bible says to everything there is a season to your situation and you say according to the Lord and the principle of God everything there is a season and I declare and I decree that this season shall pass from me [Music] you are sick shall be sick no more you are depressed shall be depressed no more amen you are bound shall be bound no more but you've got to accept God's will you know a pardon is not a pardon until it is received as a pardon and neither is the gospel trumpet of Jubilee if you are hearing the word of God telling you you can go free and you choose to remain in your situation then you are to blame for it what are you trusting God for let me ask you young man what are you trusting God for young woman what are you trusting God for having expectation in your heart trust the Lord believe the Lord amen I need to see a church rise up in faith I need to see young men young women of God rise up in the power of His word amen have a testimony have a power of an amen have a power of an Allelujah to worship a god a living God this is not a dear church this is not a good formal tradition amen but this is the Living Church of Jesus Christ can't you hear the angel crying out to you amen you know amen come out of all my people oh Hallelujah let's just bring the store close the first Exodus was the holy spirit amen in the form of the pillar of fire god coming down up in manifestation and brought Israel out of Egypt he brought them from a natural land to the promised land second Exodus Christ bringing the church out of Judaism what was Judaism it was a traditional condition and I want to death say Amen that there's been tradition in the message God wants to bring us out of the traditions of the message into the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and then the Third Exodus The Exodus which we are now where the same Pillar of Fire takes the bride from the church world out of the natural denominational Church into the spiritual body which is called the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Branham says he is bringing them from his spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost right back into the Eternal land of the Millennium amen message is designed to take you out of this world you are in no ordinary Church if you are in this church you are going to I'm not talking physically now you got to be spiritually conditioned for it now I'm not talking about having your confidence in a church I'm talking about if you are in the body of Jesus Christ amen amen this message is designed to give you a body change amen there's no way with the message I know that Enoch was packing he could have remained outbound they could have tried to pull him into the ark the message that he received will not permit him to go into the ark he had to take a flight they're trying to pull you into the tribulation but the message you have received will not permit you to go into the tribulation but you shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye give God praise if you believe it you are not destined to go into the tribulation the message is designed to take you out of this world oh yes cry this morning amen Hallelujah from 1963 to 2023 we've had a sweeping word Revival we've experienced the greatest move of God regarding end-time prophecies for the Gentile Church yes it's one of the timeline you'll see from 1963 to 2023 has been the most Supernatural time for the church 1963 was the start of Revelation 10. if you think amen amen that being in the upper room or something we who have experienced this move of God under the opening of the word amen oh man amen there in the upper room the Holy Ghost brought itself out amongst 120 people and they shut the world in place with the gospel amen that was something important to be a part of but I'm telling you we are part of something very important 1963 was another season of the Holy Ghost not pouring amen we know we read the sport in Feast of trumpets he says the Holy Spirit has been bound by this denominational Rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening messenger the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time if you think amen I wish I lived in the days when Peter stood on the day of Pentecost you are living in a much more glorious time you are living in a much more glorious season amen this is the season amen that was the start of the Holy Ghost amongst the Gentile church this is the finishing of the holy ghost moving amongst the Gentile church and you were glad to be a part of the move of God Amen aren't you are glad to be associated with the move of God thank you Lord 1963 saw the Fulfillment of one of the greatest and most important scriptures relating and pertaining to end time prophecies and the time and season that we are living in now he had his Prophet William Branham prophesied in about six months before he took place read about it in church is this a sign of the end and you know what the prophet announced it to the world I saw in a vision sorry could have been five or seven angels and was caught up in the constellation of angels which man can predict something like that and then it comes to pass amen now while the modern Church world were unaware of the supernatural phenomenal event they are still unaware of it they don't know it it was the Fulfillment I declare to you we've got the picture put it up I declare to you that this was the Fulfillment of Revelation 10. the most powerful scripture in the Book of Revelation for us can you connect with that this morning the most powerful scripture in the Book of Revelation for us because it ties up our ministry in the scripture you have the most powerful Mighty Angel descending when the open book from heaven you have seven thundering voices we have the most powerful Gentile prophet the seventh Church age messenger revealing the mystery of God and you have the most powerful people typed out by John and they are receiving the word and they are commissioned to finish up the entire prophecies they are packing the message of the shout to gather the living Saints amen the supernatural happenings that I'm talking about are not for the unbelievers God is not interested in proving and fussing and debating with the unbelievers these signs are given to Believers that understand the times and the seasons to give them rapturing Faith so that they can prepare to live this three-dimensional world Amen and go to the marriage supper of the Lamb pick this up for the Caleb in trying to do God his service without it being his will 27th November 65. hear what the prophet says now when he's talking about the cloud talking about the coming of that angels he says how many have you seen the picture of it was taken in Houston you got the message paragraph 77. he says as it went up I didn't know that the observatories and things Plumbing to Mexico was taking that picture years Life Magazine packing the picture of it a mysterious thing here and they said they don't know where it come from but we know it's too high it's above all these peers and everything else to be it's too high for fog because it's 30 miles high and 27 miles across after it got up that high there's not even humidity or nothing up there and they thought of a plane so they checked all the places no playing up that day said that was 78 79 he says here it is in Science magazine where they can't understand they don't know what it is and in Haiti he says Tucson University a friend of mine went over the other day and was talking to them about it and they told him we can't understand him Supernatural things of God cannot be explained by man and in 81 he says I said don't say nothing won't do no good cast not your Pearls Before Swine it's to the church to the elected the called out I tell you to the church the elected and the called out they have no problem with the picture amen [Music] amen amen in the Third Exodus so our last quote and
