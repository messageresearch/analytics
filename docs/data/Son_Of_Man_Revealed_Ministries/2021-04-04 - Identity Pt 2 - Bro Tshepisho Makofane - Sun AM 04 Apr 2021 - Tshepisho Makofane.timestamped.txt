[42:00] walk him
[42:01] and i will be their god and they shall

[46:01] someone in there
[46:02] in this depth somewhere laid our bodies
[46:06] at that time
[46:07] for we are the dust of the earth and in
[46:09] heaven there was a book of
[46:11] memory and
[46:23] [Music]
[46:24] he knew
[46:36] [Music]
[46:40] is
[46:54] how much more glorious was that sunrise
[46:58] amen to us right in the beginning much
[47:00] more glorious
[47:02] than that very festive amen
[47:05] because the real scene had been broken
[47:08] the one who
[47:22] yes
[47:29] [Music]
[47:35] in all the history of the world
[47:47] [Music]
[47:50] of the old testament prophets of all the
[47:54] the mighty works that god manifested in
[47:56] their lives
[47:58] satan always sat in a corner and knew
[48:00] that
[48:01] when they come to the end of life's
[48:03] journey they are coming
[48:18] uh
[48:25] [Music]
[48:41] [Music]
[48:45] the bible shows
[48:47] [Music]
[48:54] and the lord jesus christ can come to
[48:59] declare
[49:01] [Music]
[49:14] is
[49:41] [Music]
[49:52] [Applause]

[51:19] [Music]
[51:24] [Music]
[51:48] is
[51:57] [Music]
[52:03] the first one to reach maturity and what
[52:06] does it mean
[52:07] and it means that the rest of the field
[52:10] must come to the same
[52:11] level of maturity in our age god brings
[52:14] up a prophet
[52:15] who reached the level
[52:23] it gives us hope to know that we are to
[52:26] reach
[52:26] the same level of the church amen no god
[52:30] did not
[52:42] this message is from god this message
[52:44] has been dedicated
[52:50] [Music]
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:58] you
[53:06] [Music]
[53:12] hey
[53:41] church and he must have that type of
[53:43] vision
[53:44] for him to receive he's not going to
[53:46] receive the
[53:47] christians that are still greed once the
[53:50] witch has reminded him
[53:52] and then i'm
[54:00] we look back to our origin to see
[54:02] ourselves
[54:03] in the mind of god and to see ourselves
[54:07] as an attribute
[54:23] question and answers where the prophet
[54:24] of god says
[54:27] and i look back and
[54:31] hope to capture it but i think i'll just
[54:35] take it
[54:38] if you start a cod
[54:41] you can go all the way back and to sort
[54:44] of page 14
[54:45] there but i wanted to pick it up
[54:47] somewhere i think it's in page
[54:49] and 21 52
[54:53] cog it says now and
[54:56] privacy to understand um
[55:02] that's pretty good that's
[55:17] [Music]
[55:43] [Music]
[55:47] and we are returning back to that image
[55:51] that's right to our first created
[55:54] image amen i like what the program is
[55:57] teaching us here
[55:58] because you know again we can read
[56:00] genesis 126.
[56:31] i was before the foundation of the world
[56:34] he made my being
[56:35] my spirit i wasn't conscious of anything
[56:39] as far as but i was dead all of us
[56:42] we
[56:52] [Music]
[57:07] because he's saying something real
[57:10] important
[57:25] i wasn't conscious of anything as far as
[57:28] i know of
[57:28] but i was dead oh but now
[57:32] just a minute jesus told the disciple
[57:34] that he knew that before the foundation
[57:37] and paul said here that he chose us in
[57:39] here before the conditional world
[57:41] now there was some part of me
[57:44] me here is to my
[57:47] analysis
[57:50] these spirits which
[57:59] rotated off of god they were a part of
[58:02] god
[58:02] and all that god wanted to do was to
[58:04] express it
[58:06] [Music]
[58:27] [Applause]
[58:31] [Music]
[58:34] [Applause]
[58:43] which the prophet says for a jewish
[58:45] person to end up in that position
[58:46] he has really would have been
[59:05] [Music]
[59:15] and that same way that became flesh in a
[59:18] body called
[59:18] jesus is that same well as we can flesh
[59:21] us today
[59:22] it has to be fresh in us today and
[59:25] we saw when also who
[59:29] for many years lost his crop to the
[59:31] philippines
[59:32] but one day when he realized that he's a
[59:35] jew
[59:35] and when he got to again who
[59:38] came to himself
[59:42] he is a jew and he would slave
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:12] rotated
[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:37] [Applause]
[1:00:41] into existence by the word of god
[1:00:44] no to see that you know you're not just
[1:00:47] a
[1:00:47] a believer but god
[1:00:51] spoke you into it amen and for you to be
[1:00:54] here today
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:23] this bible is our id books amen when we
[1:01:25] pick up this bible to
[1:01:27] to find ourselves in this book to see
[1:01:29] ourselves and here
[1:01:31] the bible says i will dwell in them
[1:01:34] and walk in them and you put yourself in
[1:01:37] the way
[1:01:38] and imagine yourself in the scripture
[1:01:40] what it says i will blame them
[1:01:42] you say god is saying he will develop in
[1:01:45] me
[1:01:46] he will walk in me he's saying that
[1:01:49] i am his temple
[1:01:53] a book and see ourselves in here
[1:01:57] it gives us authority it gives us power
[1:02:00] we are able to live
[1:02:01] victorious and because
[1:02:47] amen he he allocated us to different
[1:02:50] times and seasons and he declared
[1:02:54] here in this age to come and receive
[1:02:57] this message to come and manifest his
[1:03:00] history
[1:03:12] [Applause]
[1:03:15] the right to the finish and that's why
[1:03:17] the bible says in hebrews 11
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:23] and we'll just take it for context in
[1:03:27] in the midst of god
[1:03:34] god expressed in jesus christ
[1:03:38] who was old father son and holy
[1:03:41] all manifested or
[1:03:44] in the lord jesus christ and that's why
[1:03:48] also gracious tonight and he was the
[1:03:51] fullness of god in the body amen
[1:03:54] and he says the fullness of the godhead
[1:03:56] body now the complete
[1:03:59] fullness of the body and body dwells in
[1:04:01] this church
[1:04:04] he just said to us god expressed in
[1:04:07] jesus christ
[1:04:14] [Music]
[1:04:23] [Music]
[1:04:38] the
[1:04:42] poured into christ and all christ
[1:04:45] lost he poured into the church
[1:04:49] and you know we need to
[1:04:53] highlight and emphasize the bible and
[1:04:55] then probably say here
[1:04:57] oh amen
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:02] because you can say that because
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:41] amen because a son of god cannot be
[1:05:44] cannot be god god is only
[1:05:48] together
[1:06:16] you receive me amen because then i
[1:06:19] received me
[1:06:20] received the network
[1:06:23] that all that was god he has
[1:06:26] been poured into me
[1:06:27] and he said that all that is in me i
[1:06:30] recorded him
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:44] and
[1:06:59] receive the father because all that was
[1:07:01] in god
[1:07:02] was poured into me and all of us in the
[1:07:05] lord jesus christ as we poured
[1:07:07] into the church the beginnings
[1:07:10] and maybe we appreciate and recognize
[1:07:14] that
[1:07:14] that all means all right and and and
[1:07:17] also that as as as god
[1:07:22] is and maybe
[1:07:26] this this story that the prophet calls
[1:07:29] chaos
[1:07:31] himself it's not so much it's not like
[1:07:33] you're putting water into it
[1:07:36] and then you pour water into a glass but
[1:07:38] that's not that's not that kind of
[1:07:39] product
[1:07:40] it's a complete
[1:08:04] so the only place that the jews could
[1:08:07] find god in their age
[1:08:09] amen if they sought god they had to come
[1:08:13] to the lord jesus christ
[1:08:14] and and so any anyone
[1:08:18] else that they thought they are
[1:08:20] worshiping as god
[1:08:22] when jesus says all power in heaven
[1:08:25] he is saying that that one is no power
[1:08:38] [Music]
[1:08:44] he is now poured into the church he says
[1:08:47] in the spoken word
[1:08:48] have faith in god part of sin and
[1:09:05] his inspiration and it books the whole
[1:09:08] bible together
[1:09:09] on every word in the bible it's the most
[1:09:13] wonderful book that has come out and you
[1:09:16] know
[1:09:16] it's a it's a it's our story
[1:09:20] [Music]
[1:09:46] and where you are
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:51] and jesus christ the son of god he was
[1:09:54] the word of god here on earth
[1:09:57] we know that he was god's way in the
[1:10:00] beginning
[1:10:13] amen god entitled to working himself
[1:10:17] since he was either god himself
[1:10:19] manifested in flesh
[1:10:20] or the greatest deceiver the lord has
[1:10:22] ever had
[1:10:24] he was god amen
[1:10:28] he's given us
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:39] [Applause]
[1:10:56] to say that the lord jesus christ
[1:11:00] he was both human and god amen
[1:11:04] and he said coming out the mountain he
[1:11:06] was hunting like a man
[1:11:08] when he saw the tree he looked to find
[1:11:10] things and
[1:11:30] [Music]
[1:11:36] whatever he said it had to come to pass
[1:11:40] because it was god speaking out of the
[1:11:43] name
[1:11:45] that created power of god same creative
[1:11:49] power
[1:11:51] and everything that god wants he emptied
[1:11:54] his entire being
[1:11:56] amen there was no part left anywhere
[1:11:58] else
[1:12:00] that they didn't even know what because
[1:12:01] there is a dimension yes
[1:12:05] he's walking heaven
[1:12:10] into jesus christ and everything
[1:12:13] jesus christ was every day
[1:12:17] underlying everything that jesus christ
[1:12:20] was
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:34] that we should not come to a spot where
[1:12:36] we don't realize who we are
[1:12:38] you don't realize the power that's life
[1:12:41] in this
[1:12:42] building
[1:12:48] is
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:14] [Music]
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:44] is
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:58] uh
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:12] but now how would we look for him
[1:14:16] what kind of person would we look for
[1:14:19] if we wanted to see if you are the same
[1:14:22] if he was here in arkansas tonight
[1:14:26] in this room
[1:14:38] he says
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:53] [Music]
[1:15:01] [Applause]
[1:15:10] [Music]
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:36] that's
[1:15:40] [Music]
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:16:04] yes
[1:16:28] [Applause]
[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:56] [Applause]
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:41] that's exactly what
[1:17:47] [Music]
[1:17:56] is
[1:18:25] [Music]
[1:18:36] we are the word
[1:18:43] [Applause]
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:03] and that's why he says
[1:19:21] was here today he would be the word of
[1:19:23] god
[1:19:24] that's exactly what he wants and he
[1:19:26] still is he is the way
[1:19:28] not only the ritual yes
[1:19:32] but the manifestation
[1:19:40] [Music]
[1:19:49] and he was manifested in flesh that was
[1:19:52] jesus christ
[1:19:53] god in mind amen so that's our mystery
[1:19:56] today
[1:19:58] because the question that was answering
[1:20:00] says but
[1:20:02] now
[1:20:17] he
[1:20:28] [Music]
[1:20:44] bible says exodus 4 15 and thou
[1:20:48] shalt speak unto me and put words
[1:20:52] in his mouth and i will be
[1:20:55] with thy mom with his mouth
[1:20:59] and will teach you what you shall do and
[1:21:02] you
[1:21:02] and he shall be life's old man unto the
[1:21:05] people
[1:21:06] and he shall be even he shall be to be
[1:21:10] instead of the mouth and thou shall be
[1:21:13] to you
[1:21:14] instead of god
[1:21:17] this is this is god moses amen and
[1:21:20] you know god says to moses because moses
[1:21:24] and i can't go away when
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:22] is
[1:22:34] [Applause]
[1:22:36] uh
[1:22:49] god made moses so much of god
[1:22:53] that he never no he wasn't just god
[1:22:57] god was god he made moses god and even
[1:23:01] made him a prophet and aaron the bible
[1:23:04] says
[1:23:05] aaron was not the prophet because
[1:23:08] moses which is what he says in chapter 4
[1:23:11] he will be unto you okay because the
[1:23:14] prophet
[1:23:18] amen is that's what moses and that's
[1:23:21] again
[1:23:22] the key that they have to the length we
[1:23:25] have to look at ourselves too
[1:23:27] that's that's where we have to find and
[1:23:29] locate
[1:23:30] our identity that god
[1:23:33] has made us god
[1:23:36] the same way that he did moses
[1:23:48] moses coming from the presence of god
[1:23:50] with the word of god
[1:23:52] for that age now watch uh
[1:23:55] 19 or 20
[1:23:58] that's where it goes says
[1:24:15] for that age he says there is a word
[1:24:18] for each age yes
[1:24:22] and moses coming further his face shine
[1:24:26] so shiny saucy the word
[1:24:29] was in amen ready to be
[1:24:32] manifested to be given out today
[1:24:36] so this moles is now coming with the way
[1:24:39] the word in him ready to be given out
[1:24:42] today
[1:24:50] moses noticed him to us with moses
[1:24:54] and was ready to be myself
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:37] moses had to date himself
[1:25:52] that
[1:26:06] um
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:35] [Applause]
[1:26:48] he was god and that's what the prophet
[1:26:51] is teaching us here and in the prophet
[1:26:54] and the word is in the mind
[1:26:56] so now if the word if moses
[1:27:00] made moses god whatever
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:16] is
[1:27:58] jews
[1:28:12] [Applause]
[1:28:22] [Music]
[1:28:26] rejected now at the end of this
[1:28:28] dispensation
[1:28:29] much like so the word was rejected as
[1:28:33] the son of man
[1:28:34] in the midst of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:54] the truth because what is the message
[1:28:56] the message is to identify
[1:28:58] christ this is the same ingestion of
[1:29:01] christ
[1:29:02] yeah and now the revelation of the word
[1:29:05] will reveal to them and he says there's
[1:29:08] seven seals to the gentiles
[1:29:14] christ and and that's why
[1:29:21] when they receive the revelation
[1:29:47] [Music]
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:30:04] for which
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:18] foreign
[1:30:21] but for blessing when you want to call
[1:30:24] yourself
[1:30:25] god has to bless you when you want to
[1:30:32] receive
[1:30:47] that god had made himself man
[1:30:51] it wasn't a man making himself god god
[1:30:53] had come to make himself
[1:30:55] man that's what happened there he said
[1:30:57] he said
[1:30:58] jesus is not written in your lord
[1:31:02] i said you are god
[1:31:05] the word of god came and the scripture
[1:31:09] cannot be wrong
[1:31:10] so what name moses god
[1:31:13] was because he had the word
[1:31:19] [Applause]
[1:31:26] and that's what makes the right god she
[1:31:29] becomes that final voice
[1:31:30] in this age and the proper god says
[1:31:34] and in souls are increasing up three
[1:31:36] four five
[1:31:37] he says uh look at the scriptures
[1:31:40] hiding here could it be in
[1:31:55] the church is going yeah
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:25] of his way the power of this revelation
[1:32:28] and it will
[1:32:28] break forth into the other dimension but
[1:32:31] he is yet
[1:32:32] to remain as the word of god sixth
[1:32:40] sin has produced itself amen and the
[1:32:43] prophet
[1:32:45] is the two prophets yes and it says the
[1:32:48] seventh
[1:32:50] take our office again
[1:33:00] [Applause]
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:20] is
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:53] [Applause]
[1:34:17] down and go and call him lord see what
[1:34:20] would you have to do
[1:34:21] the life that was in him will be
[1:34:24] produced
[1:34:25] in us that's saying like i was in the
[1:34:27] lord jesus christ the same one who
[1:34:29] strike what
[1:34:30] will be the people
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:44] that our lives have to be a reproduction
[1:34:48] of the life
[1:34:49] of the lord jesus christ and because
[1:34:52] you know it was not so much when we talk
[1:34:54] about the blood it's not so much the
[1:34:55] character but
[1:34:56] the light of the that lord
[1:35:00] life and that's why the prophet teaches
[1:35:02] us that the life
[1:35:03] of bulls and gold couldn't help because
[1:35:05] the life of the animal
[1:35:07] could not come into the community but
[1:35:10] when he
[1:35:10] came as our kinsmen redeemer
[1:35:17] the children were partakers of flesh
[1:35:20] and blood amen he had to come and
[1:35:23] partake of
[1:35:24] flesh and blood here to come and become
[1:35:38] [Music]
[1:35:38] [Applause]
[1:36:12] [Music]
[1:36:23] of us and
[1:36:28] okay something is the same the same
[1:36:31] point that he's making around that any
[1:36:33] imposter
[1:36:34] can come here he says
[1:36:37] in the spoken recording jesus he makes
[1:36:39] this point
[1:36:41] and that man could be trying to make
[1:36:43] himself jesus
[1:36:44] he says and jesus will not be seen in
[1:36:47] that
[1:36:48] kind of a body until we see him
[1:37:11] god identified himself in you
[1:37:15] you are his temple yes you are
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:29] what should not confuse us is that
[1:37:35] [Applause]
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:15] is to feed our souls to this way and the
[1:38:18] more we
[1:38:19] eat this way the more the the
[1:38:22] inner man has power over this place the
[1:38:25] more the stress
[1:38:26] comes under subjection of the way
[1:38:42] [Music]
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:40:01] [Applause]
[1:40:03] [Music]
[1:40:05] [Applause]
[1:40:06] [Music]

[1:40:48] um
[1:40:50] he says look god in his body
[1:40:53] christ and christ in his body

[1:41:10] from the body of christ his flesh
[1:41:13] his body which is the way and is
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:30] that god was in his body cut
[1:41:33] and that christ is not in his body
[1:41:35] thereby
[1:41:37] god manifested himself in that body
[1:41:39] called jesus christ
[1:41:40] and now christ has manifested himself in
[1:41:42] his body
