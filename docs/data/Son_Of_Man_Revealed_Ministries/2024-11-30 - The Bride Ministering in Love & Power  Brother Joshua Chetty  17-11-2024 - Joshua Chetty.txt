TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] amen amen praise the Lord thank you Lord amen you may be seated God bless you amen greet everyone in the name of our Lord and savior Jes Jesus Christ amen amen our God is a mighty God amen amen and he's worthy to be praised hallelujah amen Bible says in Psalm 57 be merciful unto me oh God be merciful unto me for my soul trusted in thee y in the shadow of thy Wings will I make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed I will cry unto God most high unto God that performed all things for me me he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up God shall send forth his mercy and his truth amen and he's really done it for us in this time and season amen he sent the opening of the word he sent us a prophetic gift amen according to the scriptures Revelation 10:7 Malachi 4:5 and verse 6 Amen to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers amen I if you've been rejoicing with the meetings been blessed with the services amen and most of all I've trust that we are growing in Christ amen so like the song says amen the song was sonng this morning the answer is Jesus Christ yahusha amen Jesus Christ he's our savior he's Our Redeemer he's the king of kings and he is the Lord of lords amen so I just want to share a testimony to give glory to God this morning amen everybody feeling good amen amen so if you remember last week after the service while we were singing We stopped singing and I turned to these brothers and I said with this teaching you can look for greater anointing and miracles how many if you remember that amen praise the Lord so we got a testimony to give glory to God and sometimes things are done in Simplicity and but he'll do it in a way to bring glory to his name yes remember what we've been teaching you that the glory will be revealed in the bride to give him greater glory yes amen so you know on Wednesday we had a prayer meeting how many of you enjoying the prayer meeting amen amen praise the Lord amen so Chantel we brought the prayer request to the church on wedness day so she was admitted in hospital on wedness day and prior to that she was diagnosed with kidney stones and so she said her inflammatory markers were really high so they were going to schedule her for for the test and things like that but prior to that she was also having Iron Infusion and also getting blood transfusion I think she was getting it at least once a year amen so this time she got admitted and she told me she was going to have a c scan the pelvic exam x-ray ultrasound blood test and so when I checked on on uh was it wednessday I think it was wednessday or Wednesday she got admitted and then I checked to her and then she said well she's just waiting now for the doctor to come she should be discharged in the morning that's Thursday so I said that's fine amen we brought the pray request to the church then uh she wasn't discharged on Thursday so then in the evening it gave me the opportunity to go to the hospital and pray for her amen and uh so I you know On th on Tuesday I was there with brother at brother Denver's house Wednesday we had church so Thursday and I was looking forward to spending some time with the children amen and you know how they get if you leave them so I told them okay all of you jump in the car they sat in the car while I went up to pray amen so I go up in the room amen just begin to minister scripture to Shantel and there's other patients in the room and uh very simple prayer for some reason Susanna was shantel's daughter recorded the prayer so if you want to hear the prayer it's a very simple prayer very Ash tone not a screaming prayer or a shouting prayer very calm prayer amen but uh someone in Authority who knows the position don't have to shout and scream yes amen so anyway we left her there and then I also in my prayer I prayed over the other patients as well so the next morning they they sent a message on the group and she says the doctors have come back and all of them have been discharged amen now she says that uh there was another lady in the room there had endometriosis she had one ovary removed last or some time ago last year she had a and she was back now because they were going to do further test and they told her that she's got this endometriosis and they're going to probably if the test results come back negative they're going to remove that as well amen but a doctor came in and said all the test results are clear amen and she's discharged as well there's another lady who had a tumor also discharged and she says all of them were in shock even the nurses were in shock because that entire room got discharged am now come on and give him praise amen Lord amen so that's what the power of God can do amen and that's what we are looking for is Bible times back again amen amen we are not preaching these things to educate the people and then not show the proof of it amen so Peter and John amen is typing and like brother brandom says needs to be in every believer the combination and we know that Peter and John is typing love and he's typing Faith but in between is all the other virtues amen so we're looking for a church coming into perfect Faith amen a perfect condition amen and I like amen I was having our prayer night services on awareness day because it's equipping the church amen it's getting the church involved to pray amen amen hallelujah and then brother Joshua was also sharing a testimony amen when we went to pray for his dad he also prayed for another man who was there for a heart attack and he had heart condition and things the family is still in touch with him saying that after he prayed that man is completely well amen completely healed hallelujah amen so we just want to be humble servants of God Amen that can allow his glory to be revealed in us and his power to be revealed in US amen because we can't have word only yes amen amen the prophet says we don't go chasing after signs but he says if we get the word the signs must follow amen so if we had the full opening of the word this church a messy Church can't be a dead Church it can't be a poish church amen we've got to rewrite the book of Acts Hallelujah and if we can just count the testimonies that have transpired amen since last year you'll see the magnitude of it it's not ordinary testimonies amen that's the power of God coming through the church now and you'll see it increase and get greater and greater and greater as the bride comes into full maturity and that's what we are contending for that's what we are laboring for to bring the church to maturity amen and to give God praise amen praise the Lord so we just want to thank him amen for what he's doing amen it's it's nothing Amen to to get puffed up about because remember these things you need to remain in humility amen amen it's just to give glory to God and to testify because these things must be seen amongst the people can you imagine if I'm preaching something and you see no evidence of it and I'm going to be honest with you on Wednesday night when I left home I I had a discourse with the Lord I mean sorry when I went home praying and I said Lord it can't be that in the Bible when they are receiving the Holy Ghost it is Flowing so freely and it seem such like a natural process but yet in the message church it's being preached like you have to know this you have to know this you have to know this but yet 40 years later they know all of these things but no power in the church something is is wrong amen we don't want educated Geniuses so the letter can kill you and brother we were laboring for the for the mechanics brother brandham opened up all the Mysteries now how can we take 40 years to preach revealed the Mysteries yes amen the prophet revealed the Mysteries everybody agree that's was his job so can we come week after week to teach you revealed Mysteries something is wrong now we can't like I said there's a sickness uh the the message came to take away our Amnesia but there's a sickness called dementia amen where you can know your identity but sometimes you can forget the next day you find you remember who you are as a son and daughter of God then you get dementia you forget who you are we don't want spiritual dementia yes amen we want a spiritually strong church and I tell you nothing shall be able to stand before you I ask you in any area of your life hallelujah amen amen thank you the body of Christ is on the earth now the angel of God is on the earth now amen and we challenge any sickness any circumstance any any problem that you're going through bring it under the Shan of glory and watch it disappear amen amen amen praise the Lord amen so that's what we are contending for so be in prayer amen when we having prayer services when we having prayer night services amen even if it's all night prayer or we're having special services amen be there be a part of it be equipped with it and I also believe amen that your prayer on Wednesday night also had a major part to do with it amen amen so you are also part of the testimony amen so if you're not in church if you're missing Church you got to get yourself back in church amen you got to get yourself back in church because things are heating up now God is maturing the church and you don't want to be immature you don't want to be left behind where you are not coming in the presence of the sunlight your fruit is still green While others are ripening amen amen so we all want to mature together we want to grow together so that amen God can get the glory amen how many if you want to make the Rapture the body change we are all striving for that amen so we don't want to come so close and then miss it amen let's all Stand Together We Bless The Name of Jesus Amen praise the Lord so I pray amen even as we've been speaking on love Hope and Faith there's some things you need to ponder you know there was a quote going around you know uh voice of God sends out these quotes a daily clip amen you must have read it I think brother s also put it on the group amen I just want to read it because it was confirming what we've been preaching here and now listen to what brother gram is saying here in this message amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says in 20 years of research of the Bible so he has a man who studious and listen what he says next and talking with the angel of the Lord 20 years of Bible research and talking with the angel of the Lord and many things I find here is two things that is love and faith amen amen hallelujah Peter and John love and faith if you love God just purely unadulterated love you've got to have faith in him it'll accompany Faith every time and when love and faith gets married you ask what you want and you'll have it amen so that's our desire the word has been producing Faith but we want love and faith to be joined together yes amen he says when love and faith gets married you ask what you want to and you'll have it when you know that your heavenly father cannot tell you any Lie Is God he can't lie and then when you believe him with all your heart and you believe that what you ask for you ask it not with any selfish motive but your right motive behind there is to ask it for the glory of God and believe without a shadow of doubt that your father won't lie to you something's going to take place when you get all the cockle birs out the way just look straight straight there to Calvary and believe it with all your heart amen so I found that very striking 20 years of research and talking personally with the angel of the Lord he ties it down to two things and that's where the angel has taken us hasn't he been taking us in that in the last few weeks we've been speaking on that so here comes the court now to confirm it amen praise the Lord so let's just lift up our hands amen even as we invite our amen our brother Joshua to come to share the word of the Lord you be under expectation amen you beond expectation whatever your need is whatever your desire is if you want the Holy Ghost if you're saying Lord I want a greater portion of the Holy Ghost if you're saying Lord reveal yourself more to me maybe you're unwell in body maybe you're going through a financial need maybe you're going through a personal problem maybe your family is in distress maybe you're trusting God for a partner in life maybe you're trusting God Amen to help you in your exams whatever it is this morning you know your needs let's present it before the Lord while the word is being preached you present your needs before the Lord and before you leave this place your prayer shall be [Music] answered yes's my cup [Music] Lord I Lift It Up

written right now written by a people end time people oh God Jesus Lord we know when the time was supposed to come Prophet said it'll be a quick short work yes we know we don't have much time left oh

is distracting us this morning and bring our thoughts to The Obedience of to your word this morning Father And I pray this morning that when we leave this place oh God be like the two men from M said did not the heart burn within us along the way and father I pray this morning oh God many others might have different needs but Lord we have rightful claims to every Redemptive blessings oh God and we know that every time we mention this promises we cause chaos in Satan's kingdom but Lord we have rightful claim to this promises and Lord we know that we can freely ask of these promises of God and we know Lord that you want to give us these promises of God but you want your children to ask oh God and we lord when we ask you must ask with confidence in your word father believing having faith that we when we ask these things we shall receive them Father and we know Lord Jesus this morning that you are more than able to meet with every need father I pray now you'll come and take full cause of this meeting in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen GRE you all in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you heard testimony from Pastor Adrian it it is indeed these things that we can say that what was one's prophecy is now being manifested amen through a bride yes because it's the body of Christ amen it's the body of Christ that is on work on the earth amen amen each one has a different part to play in the body but all are fly framed into this body amen each one has a different Ministry one each one has a different gift but we all make up the same body amen and each one got a might have a unique uh way of operating in the body but you got to find your position amen because you can't operate outside the body you got to operate within the confin of the body of Christ it's the mystical Body of Christ it's the book of Acts in continuation amen so for scripture reading this morning we'll turn to the book of second Timothy second Timothy chapter 1: 7 second Timothy 1: 7 amen praise the Lord for God had not given us the spirit of fear yes amen but of power amen and of love and of a sound mind so once you got fear you don't have power you don't have love and you don't have a sound mind amen amen but God has not given us that spirit of fear yes it is not for his children amen yes amen it wasn't so in the beginning yes when God created his son on the earth when Adam was on the earth he wasn't Walking In Fear yes amen fear came when he sinned that now he could he wants to be fearful and hide from the presence of God because he recognized it a sin yes amen but apart from that he looked forward to his father coming down every evening to have fellowship with him a and when God would go down he would looking he was looking forward to have fellowship with his son but on that day on that evening when he wants to go and have fellowship with his son his son was not available for him amen we also turn quickly to the book of one John before we take our seats 1 John 4:8 to 20 1 John 4: 8-20 he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love amen in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him hearing his love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to to be the pro propitiation for our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another amen amen no man had seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US amen so God's love can only be perfected through his body which is the bride of Christ amen hereby no know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he had given us of his Spirit yes thank you that's the evidence amen and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that Jesus is a Son of God God dwelleth in him and he and he in God and we have known and believe the love that God add to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him amen herein is our love made perfect that we may have Bish in the day of judgments see love gives you this confidence amen because as he is so are we in this world so we must reflect his very image amen his very characteristics there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear at torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hated his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he had seen how can he love God whom he had not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also amen you may be seated amen just for a little title this morning we'll speak on the bride of Christ ministering in love and power amen amen the bride of Christ ministering in love and power for the subtitle we call it Satan will be powerless before the bride amen amen amen hallelujah so this bride is ministering in love and power amen amen you know the prophet says when Divine love has been projected and come to its end its destination Sovereign Grace will take over amen amen The Book of Luke chap 10:19 says behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy me and nothing shall by any means hurt you so you see this power is given it comes because of inheritance amen it comes because you are part of him he can't give this power just to anybody amen God's love come down amen through Jesus Christ yes that he can be the savior of the world to redeem back man to the original condition and that's why he says now I give unto you power because man has lost that he lost his first state amen he lost his condition that he was in because he lost titled did in the Garden of Eden but Power had to come back to man yes cuz man had to come back to his original condition but what brings the power down is the love of God Amen because of his love towards us he wants to restore back man to his original condition in a condition where you will walk in perfect love in a condition you will have no me he will not walk in fear Amen in a condition where he walks having dominion over the Earth over every circumstance that he face in his life he has dominion over it he works as one with authority amen so we find that when in this day when we receive this word amen it comes to reflect and show us back what our true identity is amen because in our true identity we recognize our true Authority amen but sometime it was lost amen we had Amnesia yes we suffering from spiritual Amnesia but the opening of the word comes down the shout comes down with a message what to wake us up out of Amnesia amen amen to make us recognize who we truly are what's our purpose on the earth we have a Divine Purpose on the earth you have you have normal human beings on the Earth and people have purposes people are career driven and Purpose Driven but our purpose is a Divine Purpose it's from the Eternal thoughts of God Amen our purpose were pre was already predestinated by God Amen so Luke 10:19 says behold I give unto you power to tread on Serpent and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you yes John 14:2 says and that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you amen there must come a time where you have to recognize the oness the unity amen that God Christ was so much displaying the father amen amen he he come he said the son can do nothing by himself but what the father shows him yes amen he was in such a Oneness amen and this Wess must dwell must come into the bride where she become so in tune with Christ in such wonders with him amen amen that if you see her you see him yes amen there was nothing less of seeing him that's why he said Philip I've been so long with you and you have not seen me when he said show was the father amen so there must be such a Harmony between Christ and the bride but this bride is ministering in Divine love amen Colossians 3:14 says and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness amen amen so we know one of the attribute the main the core attribute of Christ is what love amen amen that Christ when we look at when we look at our people's failures we look at him through the human eyes but when God looks at it that's why he's giving you parables in the Bible like the prodal son and so forth he's showing you a person going down to their path to their Journey but he's also showing you the end results amen amen that's why he said to Jeremiah I know the plans I have for you plans to prosper you plans to give you an expected end am amen so you look at your life and you look at your life's journey and you look at your failures along the way by your carnal nature but when the Holy Spirit comes down and when you receive the new birth and you start to look at into the eyes of God's word you now to try start to look at your life through the word and see what the word says about you amen amen the word shows you that you are being redeemed back to an original condition amen the word is showing you that you have to come to be the sinless Spotless bride the word shows you that you are to be the judge of the Earth the word shows you that you are going to be the one that will inherit the earth amen the word shows you that you are coming back to Dominion again the word shows you that you'll have power over every deadly thing nothing shall by no means harm you amen yes amen the word shows you that you can take every divice promise of God and you don't have to take every negative word said by your doctor every negative word spoken by your employer every negative word by your bank balance you can take what the Divine Promises of God says amen yes he says to you I am Jehovah Gyra to you I am Jehovah Rafa to you I am Jehovah Shalom your god of peace to you I am the one that is with you ever present God Amen yes every attribute of God is available to you so how do you look at yourself because this is the hour where the there must be a ministering of love and power yes amen they couldn't have that people were were searching after the power amen people wanted the gifts they wanted the power but they wouldn't operate under Love Now firstly Jesus said if you love me you will keep my words yes amen and my word will not be Grievous unto you yes so you must love the words and the word is Christ and you must become one with the words because you are changing back to the words amen amen and when you are now walking in the word when you're looking at your brother your brother might have fallen down but you're not looking at what he's fallen down but you're looking at him as the sinless Spotless bride of Christ you looking at him the person that's going to be in the Rapture you're going to look at him as the one that's going to have a what he change you're going to see him as the one you can have eternal fellowship with you're going to say this brother is part of me we have the same father we have the same genes where we're in Eternal thoughts of gods because why that is why you can have love towards his brother amen and that's why when your brother has need of something he can have so much of love for you he can have confidence in you that he can come to you and say brother I have need of this and he can have because you are walking in his Divine love amen he can trust you that if he tells you his situation you're not going to go and cheat T to everybody you're not going to look at him in a caral way but you're going to look at him as a Son of God and say brother we know the enemy has come but now the enemy has come to steal and destroy but I've come to give life and give it more abundantly as a Son of God I'm taking this word and I give it to you amen amen amen amen now this is the bride that Satan will be powerless before amen because she is the one that will recognize their position she will recognize their true identity she will recognize the true church amen amen amen that's what he says he says now remember this Christ in the true church yes is a continuation yes of the book of Acts so no way did he take the book of Acts and he and he closes it off amen no way is the book of act closed off but he said is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless you see what Satan was always his tactic was make the church powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word how you discredit God's word take out the power take out the scripture that speaks about all the promises of God Amen that belongs to you right down to the time he's pass into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it amen listen to this part now he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is not what somebody else is it is good what the apostles was it's good what Jesus did on Earth it's good what brother Brandon did but what she is amen what she's stand for and that she can do the Greater Works John 14:12 she will be an invincible Army amen if they get a true revelation of the true Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit and I just telling you that before that Satan wants to make a formal and Powerless now he's telling you you must get a revelation when you see that happening then you know what Satan ising doing yes Satan will be powerless before her amen amen he will be as definitely twed today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it amen with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them you see now when you are true have a true identity a true revelation of who you truly are what's your purpose on the earth what's your position in Christ when you have a revelation of that then the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it because now you know who you are you know why you are placed in this season you know why you save for such a time as this amen when now is the time to utterly slay and Destroy every part of the enemy you leave no squatters behind don't let people squat over your land don't let people squat over your circumstances amen amen what I'm talking about demon powers yes don't let demons come squat over your land amen or your inheritance in this hour every promise belongs to you so he find his the bride when she must be the one projecting Divine love in his hour amen amen she must be the one where the world sees compassion when I'm talking about compassion I mean there's many people going and doing doing good deeds I'm not talking about that type of compassion alone that's good there's nothing wrong to do that that's a good thing to do but I'm talking about compassion when you see a person and you know you have a revelation that we are at the end time the Rapture is about to take place and after we leave the Earth Grace leaves the Earth the gospel got to go back to the Jews we in a final break we in a final hours of the Gentile dispensation and you know that many will be lost so when you look at somebody that is knowing that the soul is going to be lost you have compassion amen amen that's what brought Jesus down Amen to come and die for our sins amen so you have to show grace to the Earth right and you can't do that if you're not walking in Divine love because you have to see it how God sees it you someone might be so wasted so so much in sin so so much gone into the pits of sin but when you are walking in love you see this person and you see the way Christ looks at it amen amen because Christ is being projected through your eyes yes Christ is been projected through your hands amen through your lips amen yes so every word you speaking you speaking with instead of speaking say no that person is a waste of time just leave them they far gone no you speak life yes life and death can come from your mouth amen you have the power to do that Hallelujah because why you are reflecting the sacrificial Love Of Christ yes no one else is going to do that in this hour it's only the bride of Christ the body of Christ that can display the sacrificial Love Of Christ amen amen and is not limited only to words yes amen but is demonstrated to the way we have our service through our brethren we love God by loving each other yes amen and love comes forgiveness amen I'm talking about forgiveness not when you forgive your brother and then you go speak I forgave this brother for doing this to me you know what he did to me but I forgave him no that's not the type of forg that's not Divine love amen amen Divine love when you forgive yes and now you can walk with your brother and say no my brother I take you by the hand as my brother I love you my brother we are finishing this race together amen my brother maybe yes the enemy has come and the enemy has tried to attack you my brother but that is not you you are a son of God and I see you in the perfect image of Jesus Christ I see you as a sinless spotless bride my brother I see you my brother that we're going to finish this race together amen true forgiveness can only come to those that are walking in Christ amen it also bring you to humility amen amen Jesus showed the example of true humility yes he can go to his Brethren the apostles amen he could go to them and show them how to when he's washing the feet what are you teaching them humility amen and that's why you find that love covers a multitude of sins because that's how you overcome yes sometime you might find a situation so messed up but love can cover a multitude of sin because you can overcome to love because he's removing fear amen he's removing hatred and now he's making you think as a Son of God Amen and when you think as a Son of God what you think about you think about Grace you think about what he done for you you think about UNC no conditions to that love amen cuz he died with you died for you with unconditional love amen when you went on a cross every fault that we made every sin that we would have do everything was taken on the cross unconditionally without condition he loved us amen he didn't say I'll go to the Cross if this people do this right right right no unconditionally in our love there's nothing that you can do now to take away your sin but what he did already for you amen you are walking now in appreciation of what he's done amen you are living a life of appreciating him for what he's already done for you Hallelujah you can't add anything to your life you can't go to good works today because of the bad works you did yesterday if you if you fa Paul said I backslide daily now if you backslid yesterday today you can't go do one good work to outdo that yes no today you'll appreciate him more for bringing you out from what happened yesterday am Amen in fact you will love God more Your Love becomes stronger when you was in a worse condition amen because remember Jesus gave the example who will thank God more a person who's in a worse condition is going to and be more appreciative amen amen yes so you as a brother a son and daughter of God you take some out of their worst situation who's going to be more thankful amen amen see Christ was our example he was the example of love amen so we called as the church the church is called to live what with this bride is called out to live the word of God live out the word of God yes we had the word of God in mechanics yes we received it in theory form we received it by the letter form we received it by the hearing form amen but we are called to live out the word of God Amen in the power of the Holy spiritu amen because when the because when the Holy Spirit comes when there a refilling of the Holy Spirit it brings forth the Dynamics in the church amen it brings up forth to action Hallelujah it brings her forth to life it brings her back to operate the word of God and she doesn't compromise on the truth this bread of Christ she doesn't bow down to the pressure of this world Amen yes amen amen if you find a person who don't have the Holy Ghost they will easily compromise they will easily bow onto the prees of the world because why our foundation is on the unchanging word of God the foundation of right the foundation was on the unadulterated word of God the mechanics had to be right amen and now we find that this work that we got to do it has to be of healing Deliverance amen all the things that Christ did salvation must be a demonstration of God's power amen there must be a demonstration of the power yes all this healing Deliverance salvation and the demonstration of power must follow the true church amen a wicked and adul adulter generation seek it after signs yes but true signs follows the believer yes amen so we find that healing Deliverance salvation all these things must follow the true church it must follow it's normal that's the continuation yes of the book of Acts but if if I started on a journey maybe I'm a businessman and I started on a journey in my business and few years ago I was making the thousands of rents then maybe 10 years ago I was making in the millions of rents but now in this generation I have to be making in the billion going on to the trillions I have to have a prog Rive walk in other words there must be in my continuation of this business it must go higher there must be more Progressive amen so if we are continuation of having a continuation of the book of Acts it will continue on because Redemption is being revealed and revealed and now it's fully revealed until you're coming now where you're almost there now the only left in this part of your walk continuation is the body change amen you'll be nothing shorts of every Divine promise of God except the body change Parts amen because that's not your part to do amen your part is to come up right till you come till you get adopted in the hour yes amen where you will come to a maturity and now able to handle these words able to in handle the intelligence that's given to you able to handle your father's Kingdom amen amen because your father's kingdom is that you are handing you are earing the part on the earth amen but he said whatever you lose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven yes amen whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven amen so you find a brother that's bound bound by the enemy you loose him amen you speak that he shall be loose from that bondage amen am yes and when you are walking with anointing it's an anointing that breaks the Yoke of bondage am so your brother is walking in bondage and if you are walking such an anointing it will be the anointing that will break the Yoke of bondage but preach on Wednesday that every fiber of you amen even your Shadow amen the supernatural will take place even through your Shadow amen through every fiber of your being amen hallelujah even dead man can have the anointing yes you don't believe that look at the Bible amen the Prophet Elijah Elisha was dead for a long period of time then they plac another dead man in his tomb the dead man ran out amen amen amen even your bones are carrying an anointing yes amen amen Moses had so much of the glory of God that that his face short of the glory of God your words your speech carries an anointing amen somebody may be coming trying to give you all this flowery words and so forth and trying to put you down you just have to speak one word amen yes and shut the M of the lion hallelujah amen maybe your your employee is trying to put you down you just have to speak one word under the anointing so we call out to live the word of God Amen yes and we find all these things must follow the church amen but the secret to the power of the church is the revelation of who she is yes amen yes amen That's what Satan tried to make a stumble on Satan always tried to keep up back in history Satan tried to keep her back with the things of the past but Satan don't want her to enjoy the benefits of who she is Satan doesn't want her to walk in her own identity amen but when she understands a position in Christ amen we we know that she can never be defeated when she ident understand her identity amen you can't walk around with somebody else's Identity book am I right you're going to do your business you carry your own ID you carry your own identity you don't carry somebody else's identity so when she understands her identity now if my father is a rich man a wealthy man and I walk with my with his identity card it won't help me but if I have the same surname and I walk with my identity and now I've acquired the rights to his business I have to show my identity but I've got his same surname then I can now conduct that business so just like that Christ we know you can't go and use the name of Christ without identifying yourself in amen so when you come to this age now of ad when you are now coming to adoption and you are now able to use his ident use his name amen amen and now you can walk with your own identity because you are recognizing who you are in him yes amen cuz your blessings are in him yes amen and now you can work under your identity because you can now you can now handle the business amen yes amen and you find if you do that you will become Unstoppable amen amen you will become victorious in this end time yes amen that's right Satan has been trying to keep you away from who you are amen but this bride must minister in love and power amen you can't just have power because power without is satanic amen but when Divine love sets in amen Sovereign Grace takes his place amen we find that this bride is not an ordinary group amen because a identity is divine according to Ephesians 1:4 he says according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and not blame before him in love so we must be holy and Without Blame before him in love yes so you see our we are not ordinary group but a predestinated group because God chosen us before the foundation of the world and we have this Authority we can Now operate under the authority amen when you now recognize who who you are you recognize your Authority your identity then you are know who your father is yes and when you recognize who your father is you now know that you have a Divine Authority and why you have this Divine Authority because you come into Union the invisible Union of the Bride of of the Earth the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride you come into a union with him and now you can oper at this Authority because of the Union amen before you didn't have this Authority because you didn't know who you are but now you come with him you you are now have a hup you never had hup before but in this day the edstone has come down amen amen when the church comes up to maturity headship comes down amen yes yes and this church knows her head oh yes and when she recognizes her head she can Now operate through operate Authority because of the Union amen that's why he said many will come in that day and say Lord have I not prophesied in Your Name Lord I not cast demon in name but they didn't come in a union yes they were after the power but they own minister in love amen this one is ministering in love and power because why she's come under the Union Yes amen because now this is a love affair amen this is a love Union amen this is God's the gape love coming down to his bride amen and she becomes so much like him and everything she wants to do is because of her love for him amen amen yes she wants to come and serve him because she loves him not because she just want the power no you know the story of the Seven Sons of ska and so forth how people just wanted power you know the story of the the the prophet people that call themselves prophets toward Nigeria and all over Africa they only want the power but they don't love the word they wouldn't take the word they wouldn't take their unadulterated word yes but he has to come through a union you miss the union you miss the Rapture yes amen because if there's no Union you cannot produce Jesus Christ again so you can have your Authority because of the Union amen so this bride when she recognizes who she is she can now walk and exercise the authority and when you were walking in the authority you don't have to mince your words you don't have to scream you don't have to go to a situation a cancer case and scream yes you can speak to that demon of cancer you can expose that demon that's there because you know where the demon comes from and you know where you come from you know the end of the demon and you know your end that you have an eternal life and he's going to go into the Lake of Fire right amen amen we find that being united with Christ we carry his authority amen the same power that he demonstrated over Satan belongs to the bride John 14:12 says verily verely I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than the shall he do because I go unto my father you see Jesus know knew he's telling them that I have to go unless I go you can't have this yes you can't have the authority unless I go because if I'm here I'm the authority but when I go my spirit will come upon you then you can exercise The Authority yes amen and therefore if God's Prophet was here on the scene now then this bride can't take her position because long as God's Prophet was on the scene he was the authority of the day yes amen but now when he's of the seen the authority comes to the church to the body of Christ amen amen because now she come into a union with Christ and his Spirit comes upon her amen and now that is why he says there'll be a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost comes to bring forth this church in Authority he brings it to become an operational Church she doesn't become a religious church but she's to be an operational church amen amen she's to be a living body now yes the resurrected body of Jesus Christ again amen amen and he's now what he is drawing Christ out of the scriptures drawing Christ out of History showing that he's the present God amen amen the very god of the Bible the very god of the Apostle the very God of William brandham is here now amongst us amen so ask what you will whatever your situation may be today amen if you believe that God is here then you must doesn't look at your brother and sister as Ordinary People you look at them as Divine people partakers of the divine nature of Jesus Christ and if you are looking beyond the image today you can have you can ask what you will and you can receive it amen you got to recognize where God is working in the hour he working in amen yes because once Satan gets you not to recognize the hour and the way God is working you're going to miss your blessings yes you're going to miss what he has in store for you amen and you find that people that are catching it are enjoying the blessings of God Amen people that are catching it are enjoying all the promises of God Amen because they have the right attitude towards it yes but it got that's why I said you got to do it in love then you enjoy the power amen now we know that Satan was already stripped in Calvary he stripped off his legal rights yes yes and what are the proof of it when he comes down in Revelation 101 in this day when the mighty Angel comes down with the book in his end yes and he showing the legal right is now coming back to the rightful owner amen he's showing now the legal rights must come back to his sons and daughters amen amen he showing them that you are the ones that this book belongs to amen you are the ones that must take of this book oh thank you Lord you are the one who I'm going to reveal to you now and when I reveal this the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I'm going to reveal to you the names in the book I'm going to reveal to you all my secrets and you are going to be the one who have the right now to prophesy again before Nations and tongues because you are the ones who have the right to call out those names in the book amen the lost on you have the right to to prophesy again amen you Lord thank you Lord because it's revealed unto you amen and to you alone amen thank you you become now the authority on the earth amen thank you Lord because why you was prepared to come in Oneness with him you was prepared to come into a union with him not like Vash who turn away the king's call amen but Esther was prepared to come even if it if it meant amen a life being taken away from her she was prepared to come because the love of her people amen and she loved the king as well she also had confidence that she knew the king loved her amen amen so he find that Satan was stripped off his legal rights so don't let him come lie to you with his little H bringing little circumstances in your life right don't let him lower you to speak his language don't let him lower you to speak the negative thoughts yes because he's just lowering you you are partakers of a divine nature amen yes your language is a Heavenly language amen your language knows no fear amen your language is walking in perfect love it casts way it Cast Away all fear your language Works in confidence in your father's promises amen amen because you find that Colossians 2:15 says and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumph triumphing over them in it amen so we find the Bride As the continuation of Christ on Earth enforces this Victory amen as the continuation of Christ as the body of Christ we must enforce this victory that he triumphed over Satan over every power over every demon power over principalities amen amen no demon power must ever rulership over the bribes yes no demon power has the right to bind any son and daughter of God Amen they must flee from the children of God amen amen yes we find that you know people give Satan a lot of accolades in this world but you know Satan's power is limited right Satan has an expected end the Bible speaks about it yes amen we know what's going to happen to Satan eventually Satan and his demons are going to be cast into the Lake of Fire El was created not for us not for human beings I was created for Satan and his agents yes so he has an expected end yes his defeat is already declared in the Bible yes but you'll find that Satan's power is now remember the Satan's power is effective but it's only effect when the bride doesn't exercise her Authority yes and he was having a jaw ball of a time because after the prophet left the Earth the prophet was causing chaos on the earth his ministry was causing chaos in Satan's kingdom yes but when he Lees the scene and while the bride was getting ready while the bride was receiving the word receiving the word Satan was going on a rampage but now in the hour where the bride is recognized their position she recognizes her Authority amen and now she's able to exercise The Authority then Satan becomes ineffective yes his power becomes ineffective but in the places where the bride wouldn't exercise The Authority his power will be effective that is going to bind people that is going to hold him in bondage but when the bride now is exercising her Authority because it's good to say I am the bride I am the Invincible Army I have all power given to me I it's good to say all that but unless you operate in this power you exercise in it you exercise in this authority of the word then only Satan become powerless amen amen when you start to do it when you start to go out to pray for the sick when you start to go in speak into situations amen when you start to open your mouth because you must prophesy again amen don't the the word to yourself hear it from your ears never Echo it one day from your mouth you hearing all the word but not one day you're professing it from your mouth when you start to exercise The Authority yes Satan's ability become ineffective amen Satan because he works through deception That's what Satan does col 2 Corinthians 4:4 says in whom the God of this world had blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them and Ephesians 4:30 says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption so we know that the blood of Christ is already sealed until the day of redemption amen but he comes to attack you to make you think to make you have I identity crisis yes he comes to attack you to think whether you already saved and got your going to your Eternal destination but if you are sealed it means you already sealed to your Eternal destination yes nothing can prevent you from going to that destination yes amen so you can't touch the bride because she's sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of redemption amen yes amen but he tries to come now and give you an identity crisis yes comes to give you a mental breakdown amen it plays on the five on your senses on your five senses it plays on your the conscious and so forth your memory your all those things your spirit he plays on your body he tried to bring sicknesses in he tries to do all it but he can't come to the soul amen it can't come to the soul so you got to bring the body now in line to the soul amen yes amen you got to bring the body under subjection you got to have dominion over the body amen amen you got to exercise your Authority amen and bring it in line yes amen amen now they has to be an anointing in this end time for this bride that's why God had to anoint you in his hour you could have been anointed in a day where they were fed to the Lions burnt at the Stak fought with Gladiators and so forth you could have been anointed for the where you would reform but you are anointed for this age amen you are anointed for the time where all H is Unleashed on the earth yes you are anointed for the time when deception is on the earth deception is so high that it will deceive you to believe that you are in a comfort zone believing that you are going because you are saved you receive the message of the hour but as long as he got you not to exercise your Authority not to bring that word effective in your life then you are not ministering in love and Power amen because if you are ministering in love and power because you have so much of a love for him then you will recognize what you got to do in this hour amen that you love your father so much that you got to carry out his business in his hour wasn't Jesus at the temple when he was 12 yes sir and Mary and Joseph on their Journey started looking for him and then Mary came and said don't you know your father is looking for you he said don't you know I'm about my father's business amen because in his mind was the mindset you know he had a mandate and when you come to love your father and you know the mind the Mandate that you have on this Earth that you have to beat That Body of Christ the hch is down in the to but the hch can't do nothing without the body amen we have received in the hour the body couldn't do anything without the head yes and the head can't do anything without the body but the head is sending the signals to the body but the body needs to function yes but if the body now is in life with the head in such love amen then she'll be ministering in love and power amen amen Satan hates to get exposed he hates this time when the bride can exercise her Authority he don't like people to say I am now taking this scripture and I'm going to use it now in this hour he like you to pick on somebody else they did it sometime in the past he like you to speak about a bygone testimony but he don't want to give you a present day testimony amen sometimes he make you ashamed to say your own testimony because why he doesn't want you to exercise your Authority Romans 8:19 says for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God there was there was a waiting amen there was a groaning there was a travailing waiting for this hour where sons of God will come to the maturity and be manifested on the earth amen hallelujah because why demon power were polluting the Earth demon power destroying the Earth but now that the sons of God on the earth they have to exercise The Authority the same Authority that Christ exercised when he was on the earth the same Authority that he gave Satan's kingdom a hard time when he was on the earth this bride must continue that yes because Revelation 1978 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come yes and his wife and made her ready amen now nobody goes no bride groom goes to dress up their wife maybe he would have presented the the money for the wedding and so forth yeah the Garment was given to us yes amen yeah he gave us the Garment but you have to take the Garment you have to fit into the Garment you have to make yourself ready amen you have to come into the conforms of the word amen you have to make yourself ready yes amen he said for she his wife had made herself ready now our Authority don't come on our own thoughts he don't don't come on our own ideologies our own ideas our own Doctrine our Authority comes from the word of God and that hasn't changed amen we don't add to the word we don't take out from the word our Authority lies upon the word of God Amen the Holy Spirit comes to align us with the word and when you find that this bride her Authority comes from the complete Reliance on the word of God what the word says about her what the word wants her to do in this hour amen we find that Jesus demonstrated that in Matthew 4:4 when Satan was tempting him he said man shall not live on bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God and therefore that everything that we do we follow the word of God yes therefore you can't have power without love yes Jesus said that very clearly a lot of people want the power he said if you love me you will keep my word now it's not easy for people to keep the word because they're not in the union but when you are when you are in the union you're nature your makeup everything is part of him remember the gene of God is in you amen there was a stage where you thought you just born to Earthly parents but there was another stage where you come to the realization of who you truly are amen that you no longer the Son and Daughter of so and so but you're a son and daughter of God Amen that your brother sitting next to you he is a son of go of God your sister sitting next to you she's the daughter of God so every time we're claiming the promises of God what we doing we are reminding Satan of his defeat you know that every time you claim a promise because the promises only came when Jesus died on the cross he defeated he stripped Satan of his rights on Calvary so every time you're claiming the promise do you know that you're reminding Satan of the defeat you know when you're claiming your healing you know Mind by his stripes we were healed every time you're claiming something your salvation is because of the blood of Jesus Christ your atonement every time you come you bring a sinner to the Cross you a sinner to the altar amen when a sinner is coming to the altar you're reminding Satan of his defeat yes that he has no rightful claims over you amen you think Satan's got a grip on you no he's lying to you he's only squatting on you he doesn't have the legal rights Christ has the rightful claims over you you are Christ purchased possession he purchased You by his own blood amen we know Satan's end Revelation 210 says and the devil that deceived them will cast was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the Beast and the false prophets are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever amen but this church what he said that he might present it to himself a glor glorious church amen yes not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen so we find this let me give you this last one more quote here now to show you our love is projected this you might laugh at this it's true as I'm standing here one time I was out in the field when I was a game warden and there had been a bull and killed a colored man okay you know the story there he comes there and he speaks about this bull now we get to the main part of the story so he's saying there was a killer bull right and I got close to him and he raised up and he was a killer I looked back to the fence it was too far for me to run so he was now in a position now where he couldn't even run and he was so close to me there was no tree for me to get into it well I thought this is the end I can't go no further for if I try to run you will catch me so what can I do now that's when we come to this crisis and that's when Sovereign Grace steps in then something happened in my life that I wish it would if it ever comes again that I'll never leave and I only wish that there was some way that I had the power this morning to project this to this group of men and women here and it will never leave you like when the maniac up at Oregon when when he began when he ran to the platform to kill me many of you read the read that book something happened there you often wondered I guess how those things happen it's something in instead of despising that man though he was there to take my life a Divine love set in for him and he called me a hypocrite and a snake in the grass and thousands of people sitting there and spit in my face and Drew back his fist and said I'll break every bone in your body people probably sitting there sitting here was there but instead of despising the man something grace came in and in a moment when I needed it Grace sets in and projected a Divine love into my heart that I could project to him and thought there stands a man like a man like I'm he likes to eat and drink and his family but the devil has him bound you see ministering in love what happened now you try to see a man in his normal position amen so the love of God constrained me and the man humbled himself and fell across my feet Grace stepped in When Love Was projected amen and in the case of this bull trying to kill me he got got up on his feet I looked at and looked at me and snorted three or four times and throw his horns into the ground I looked around and there was nothing and as an officer I was I was supposed to pack a gun and I wondered why I didn't have it you see now we try to think about our normal what we can do to our to protect ourselves in the flesh and I would would have killed the bull and then went and paid for it but I had no gun god seemed to e that I had no gun so sometime you put in a situation and you wonder why you are there and and you and you try to help yourself but you find that you couldn't do the things that you wanted to do to help yourself because sometime God allows that to happen amen so he wanted to show his divine grace in a crisis hour so sometime you might be in a crisis hour but God sometimes want to show his divine grace amen and something struck me way better than a gun or any weapon of this world it was the divine grace that took my heart and thinking of that animal wanted to live the same as I wanted to live and instead of hating him as he was planning to take my life I loved him that sounds juvenile but it's the truth and as he rushed towards me I said creature of God is's a man back in his Adam condition amen back man back in his original condition I am the servant of God I'm on a legit legitimate call to a man who's dying and our creator has sent me and I'm sorry disturb to disturb you out of your rest but in the name of he who created us both go go over and lay down under the tree now he man back in Dominion again instructing the animal what to do and when he got so close to me within 10 ft I was no more scared of that animal than I would be of my brethren here this morning come Divine love perfect love cast out all fear and he stopped he just looked so depleted he took both ways turned around walked over and lay down under that tree and I walked in there walk in three feet three feet of him pass by through the field safely When Love is projected Divine Sovereign Grace of God takes a hold that's what happened to okay you see what happens yes so he's showing you the situation now something got over him Divine love took over amen so one more can I give you a second don't have to my [Music] notes put myot up second one okay I got it it's in it's in the same one it's in the bottom God hat a powerless religion yes it's got to be power certainly it's a power to save a man from sin it's a power that can do signs and wonders and miracles as Jesus Christ promised they zeroed in on the word of God back there and believe it and hit the target you zero the same way on the word of God it will hit the target again it's got to because it's the same yesterday today and forever God don't like a powerless religion God does not want that God wants to perform God wants to show himself alive amen our very hope in is the resurrection is that right our hopes of life is Resurrection the resurrection of Jesus Christ you see God wants to work in his church Jesus said I'll be with you always even to the ends of the world the works that I do shall you do also amen John 14:12 Greater Works than is shall do amen amen you may stand to your feet amen [Applause] yes the musician there amen so the bride of Christ must be ministering in love and power amen you love him this morning amen amen he said God doesn't like a powerless religion amen God wants to demonstrate his power he's a supernatural God I don't know why people are afraid of the supernatural when his sons and daughters they are partakers of a divine nature they must also display the supernatural because he's a supernatural God Amen let's sing the song the original life amen God attributes were
