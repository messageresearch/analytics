[0:25] amen amen finally you found us a
[0:29] privilege to be gathered in his most
[0:31] holy name amen amen hallelujah amen you
[0:35] thank the Lord for the songs that have
[0:36] been sung amen the worship that has gone
[0:39] on
[0:39] amen you may be seated I believe in
[0:41] Ramesh at a testimony we'll call him
[0:43] before amen
[0:53] amen
[0:56] Jesus Christ
[0:59] amenities two verses from psalm 146.
[1:03] amen praise ye the Lord
[1:06] praise the Lord O My Soul while I live
[1:09] will I praise the Lord I will sing
[1:12] praises unto my God while I have any
[1:15] being amen the spawning on repeat all of
[1:19] you in the wonderful name of the Lord
[1:20] and Savior Jesus Christ amen even on
[1:23] Wednesday
[1:24] it's not too well I mean it's severe
[1:27] pains
[1:28] I said my hands and I put from the
[1:33] doctor to book a book in they told me
[1:36] there's
[1:37] no bookings for witnessing
[1:40] book on Thursday
[1:42] so when I got home I just prayed I said
[1:45] Lord you know what
[1:47] I want the Elders of the church to lay
[1:49] ends and pray for me
[1:51] and because this is what your word says
[1:54] and it's unusual amen that when I came
[1:57] to the service
[1:59] called for a prayer prayer line
[2:02] and I believe amen
[2:04] you know because I desired that yeah
[2:09] this time shall follow them that believe
[2:12] amen amen and the prophet has always
[2:14] taught us taught us that we must only
[2:17] believe all things are possible
[2:19] hallelujah amen and then uh
[2:23] called for the prayer line I said you
[2:25] know
[2:31] you know
[2:32] it's a prayer answering God Amen
[2:38] who cared for us he cares for everything
[2:41] that has our body
[2:43] our every being
[2:46] of every being
[2:51] and then
[2:53] on Thursday
[2:55] I had the pains very bad
[2:57] and I said that it's very bad
[3:01] and
[3:02] I just pretend to say that amen amen I
[3:06] just thought about what the prophet what
[3:08] the word has said what the pastors
[3:10] preached on
[3:17] an hour later
[3:25] you know the prophet has taught us about
[3:27] the supernatural
[3:29] in his early Ministry and I don't know
[3:31] why
[3:33] we are not embracing it we need to
[3:37] embrace the supernatural amen because
[3:38] our inheritance
[3:40] yes
[3:44] and we are the true inheritors of this
[3:47] Supernatural amen we have seen the
[3:49] glorifier in the days of Moses we have
[3:52] seen the same to the profile in the time
[3:54] of Paul we have seen the same color of
[3:56] fire in this last day
[4:03] oh my goodness amen
[4:08] amen God bless you Brothers for the
[4:10] testimony you believe it's in the prayer
[4:12] answering God Amen it's still Hebrews 13
[4:15] and 8. still the same yesterday today
[4:17] and forever amen thank you man
[4:20] hallelujah amen so this morning we're
[4:23] happy to be found in the house of the
[4:25] Lord
[4:26] and uh just a few announcements Amen
[4:28] brother Sani sister Lily have left this
[4:30] morning
[4:31] tour of Israel
[4:33] and we pray that the Lord will grant him
[4:36] a bless you amen amen and bring them
[4:38] home safely amen I trust that they will
[4:41] really enjoy you know they they always
[4:43] say I haven't been there
[4:45] but they say the Bible comes alive
[4:48] because we're reading about the woman at
[4:50] the well and we're reading about
[4:51] Jerusalem and reading about the temple
[4:53] or believing and have the opportunity to
[4:56] go and visit these places amen so we
[4:59] pray that the Lord will blessed him amen
[5:01] so stay Elaine and sister Jaylen are
[5:03] still recovering after the accident amen
[5:06] I'm sure most of you know amen they were
[5:08] caught up in the accident on the m41
[5:11] and they have requested the church to
[5:13] continue to pray for them as they
[5:14] recovery amen and we really want to
[5:17] thank the Lord for his protection over
[5:19] them amen yes
[5:21] the message I preach Entertaining Angels
[5:25] amen because the angels of the Lord are
[5:26] always encamped around us and from last
[5:29] year we've been preaching on the wings
[5:30] of a mighty Angel amen we've been
[5:33] speaking on the angel of the Lord
[5:36] the angel of the Lord is in the message
[5:37] the angel of the Lord is on earth now
[5:39] fixing things my brother Ramesh is
[5:41] talking about it's already
[5:44] it's already happened for the numbers
[5:45] it's already happening
[5:47] we're already writing another book of
[5:49] Acts it's no more a future tense thing
[5:52] amen amen we are currently writing
[5:55] another book of Acts
[5:58] amen if we had to take and document all
[6:02] the supernatural that has transpired
[6:05] amen there will be volumes written
[6:08] I'm talking about amongst the pride of
[6:10] Jesus Christ amen if just locally has
[6:12] been working so supernaturally with us
[6:15] how about the entire body of Jesus
[6:17] Christ amen amen hallelujah
[6:21] the thing is we can't hold back on our
[6:23] testimony and be a thief with the
[6:25] testimony because sometimes God does
[6:27] things to us and we know we are too shy
[6:29] to come and testify about it
[6:31] amen we are not to do that yes you know
[6:34] when the Lord healed uh he told him go
[6:36] and tell them
[6:38] you remember that song I got to tell
[6:40] somebody that Don Francisco said he just
[6:43] couldn't keep it in himself he had to
[6:45] tell somebody amen amen hallelujah and
[6:48] the prophet says if you don't know what
[6:49] to say just tell somebody how your fire
[6:51] got lit
[6:53] tell him amen tell him about the service
[6:55] tell him about what was being preached
[6:57] amen and the Lord can move in a
[6:58] supernatural way Hallelujah
[7:01] so we've been amazed and we've just been
[7:03] you know uh
[7:05] observing the way the Lord has been
[7:07] moving how many have you been observing
[7:09] that
[7:10] amen I know if you can testify that
[7:12] there's certainly been a change in your
[7:14] very own lives
[7:15] amen there's been a change and a shift
[7:17] in the act atmosphere because the holy
[7:20] spirit is now moving
[7:21] away in a specific season
[7:24] amen
[7:26] and some will find themselves in
[7:29] revelation 22 because
[7:31] the Bible can't do much more than
[7:34] give you the Holy Spirit and if you
[7:36] don't want to conform to the word the
[7:38] Bible says let him that's holy be holy
[7:40] and let him that's filthy be filthy
[7:43] you're either going to get more on fire
[7:45] for God or you're going to get more
[7:46] backslidden amen so when God is moving
[7:49] let's move with this program and I tell
[7:51] you you know we made that statement
[7:53] about the angel of the Lord being
[7:54] present with that accident and and
[7:56] protecting
[7:58] his daughters there that day amen so I
[8:01] went to visit them and
[8:02] uh myself brother Joshua we never spoke
[8:05] about it but both of us was doing
[8:07] private investigative work there
[8:09] amen when we were talking about it we
[8:12] were both amazed that we both went
[8:13] through the scenes of the photograph and
[8:15] we were looking for unusual things and
[8:17] you know
[8:18] because if we know the angel of the Lord
[8:19] is there we are looking for the evidence
[8:21] of it and the proof of it amen
[8:26] so
[8:28] sister Jalen uh just made also Elaine
[8:31] was referencing the testimony she was
[8:33] recalling and she says you know what
[8:34] after she had some time to sit and think
[8:36] about it she was thinking what happened
[8:38] just before the accident
[8:41] I'm not trying to spiritualize anything
[8:43] I'm telling you their testimony if they
[8:45] were here they'll tell you exactly the
[8:46] same thing in fact you can verify it
[8:48] with them
[8:50] she tell them what happened just before
[8:51] the accident was that Jaylene
[8:54] was telling a mom can you see that cloud
[8:56] there
[8:59] for those of you didn't click you see
[9:01] clouds every day
[9:05] what would make sister Jalen point out
[9:07] that specific thing that looked unusual
[9:09] about something unusual so if you know
[9:12] where the accident took place you got a
[9:13] direct view of the ocean
[9:15] when you're traveling down that m41
[9:17] there so they they're saying normally
[9:19] it's very clear but sister Jaylene saw
[9:22] this thing and she was trying to show it
[9:23] to her mom and you know what the
[9:24] surprising thing is to stealing couldn't
[9:25] see it
[9:28] now if you know about Dimensional Doors
[9:30] and how the prophet told open the boy's
[9:33] eyes
[9:34] amen so they describe it as some sort of
[9:37] mist or a cloud that was there but
[9:39] sister Elaine says she couldn't see it
[9:41] but Jalen showed her and she was just
[9:43] about to open the window to say mom look
[9:45] there when the accident took place
[9:48] so what was materializing amen come on
[9:52] Church don't be
[9:53] dull
[9:55] amen amen you've got to recognize when
[9:58] God is moving amen amen amen could it be
[10:00] that she saw the angel of the Lord
[10:02] materializing yes thank you right and
[10:05] coming in on the scene because what
[10:07] caught my attention was how all of them
[10:09] were protected it was like the hands of
[10:11] the Angel are protecting and moving and
[10:13] you know orchestrating the whole thing
[10:15] amen we don't have time right now but
[10:17] we'll share testimonies I had
[10:19] experiences like this brother Joshua had
[10:20] experiences where we were involved in
[10:22] terrible accidents and there's not a
[10:24] dent on the car amen
[10:27] who is protecting us it's the angels of
[10:30] the Lord amen amen so amen remember amen
[10:34] them in prayer and who is that it's the
[10:36] same one that materialized in the Lion's
[10:38] Den
[10:39] it's the same one that means realize
[10:41] when the three Hebrew boys were thrown
[10:42] in the fiery furnace because he is the
[10:45] present help in the time of trouble
[10:48] amen and if you can do it for them he
[10:51] can do it for you
[10:52] hallelujah amen I know you don't believe
[10:56] in church amen amen hallelujah so
[10:59] Wednesday night uh 7 PM we left Pastor
[11:02] Paul key from India be ministering first
[11:04] so look forward to that service pray for
[11:07] the service that the Lord will bless us
[11:09] and visit us once again through the word
[11:11] and through the manifestation and power
[11:13] and demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen
[11:15] so let's stand together this morning for
[11:17] the reading of God's word
[11:19] Hallelujah
[11:22] have you found prayed up
[11:23] amen have you come looking for a
[11:26] blessing
[11:30] amen
[11:31] just bear with me amen
[11:34] I've got to be sensitive to the Holy
[11:36] Spirit
[11:37] and sometimes we've got to dwell on
[11:38] certain things amen so this morning
[11:40] we'll speak on
[11:42] have you been sealed
[11:44] with the Holy Ghost
[11:46] since you believed
[11:48] the message of the owl amen amen have
[11:52] you been sealed with the Holy Ghost
[11:55] since you believed the message of the
[11:58] hour let's turn to Acts Chapter 19 Verse
[12:00] 1.
[12:01] I believe this is the most important
[12:03] question we can ask
[12:04] and this is where you know the prophet
[12:07] preaches a message where I think
[12:08] Pentecost failed
[12:10] to we can update that message
[12:13] we can say where I think some message
[12:15] people are failing
[12:18] so Acts chapter 19 and verse 1 we're
[12:20] going to find here the Apostle Paul is
[12:23] traveling to uh it says that it came to
[12:26] pass that while Apollos was at Corinth
[12:28] call having passed through the upper
[12:30] course came to Ephesus and finding
[12:33] certain disciples
[12:34] you find towards the end of the chapter
[12:36] you read There was 12 disciples then so
[12:38] 12 disciples and he said unto them have
[12:41] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[12:44] believed
[12:46] and ask yourself there since you believe
[12:48] the message of the hour
[12:51] have you have you received the Holy
[12:53] Ghost
[12:56] I want you to separate it because
[12:58] doesn't mean that you believe the
[13:00] message of the hour that you got the
[13:01] Holy Ghost
[13:04] and they said unto him we have not so
[13:06] much as heard whether there be any Holy
[13:08] Ghost
[13:09] and he said unto them unto what then
[13:12] were you baptized and they said unto
[13:15] John's baptism
[13:17] so some are staying with just the
[13:19] forerunner's message
[13:22] but we need to connect with the angels
[13:25] message amen
[13:26] amen get that deeper meaning there now
[13:29] this is the first Forerunner he's got
[13:31] disciples that even after Jesus came and
[13:35] died buried rose again they're still
[13:37] following his ministry
[13:38] they haven't progressed
[13:41] they hadn't gone to the upper room
[13:44] can you believe they were under the
[13:46] message of the first Forerunner and
[13:48] hadn't gone to the upper room
[13:50] hmm
[13:51] could there be people under the message
[13:53] of the second Forerunner and have not
[13:55] gone to the upper room to receive the
[13:57] holy ghost things don't change history
[13:59] doesn't change amen history repeats
[14:01] itself and he said unto them unto what
[14:04] then were you baptized and said unto
[14:05] John's baptism then said Paul John
[14:08] verily baptized with the baptism of
[14:10] repentance saying unto the people that
[14:12] they should
[14:13] which should come after him that is on
[14:16] Christ Jesus
[14:19] now the Angel's message all along was if
[14:22] you get the people to believe you a son
[14:24] of man if you get the people to believe
[14:26] you a son of man but there came a point
[14:29] in the prophet's Ministry where he said
[14:31] that's our Lord up there a son of man
[14:34] now needs you to believe this son of man
[14:36] amen amen there is a transition yes
[14:40] that's why the voice of God cannot try
[14:43] to idolize and lift up the prophet's
[14:45] Ministry and try to preserve his
[14:48] ministry his legacy is already preserved
[14:50] in scripture amen amen it's already
[14:52] written in scripture it's engraved in
[14:54] Scripture
[14:55] they don't need to do it
[14:58] amen amen the Lord wrote him in
[15:00] Scripture
[15:01] but now the focus must be the son of man
[15:04] that's why the prophet is saying I must
[15:07] decrease and he must increase amen
[15:10] hallelujah
[15:13] when they heard this they were baptized
[15:15] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:17] and when Paul had laid out his hands
[15:19] upon them the Holy Ghost came on them
[15:21] and they spake with tongues and
[15:24] prophesied
[15:25] and all the men were about 12. now let's
[15:28] turn to Luke 3 16. we all know John 3 16
[15:31] right
[15:32] for God so loved the world he gave his
[15:33] only begotten son whosoever believeth on
[15:36] him
[15:37] should not perish but have
[15:39] everlasting life amen yes Luke 3 16 tied
[15:44] in perfectly with that
[15:46] now here's the foreign is saying I
[15:48] indeed baptize you with water but one
[15:51] mightier than I cometh the latchet of
[15:54] full shoes I am not worthy to unloose he
[15:57] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[15:59] and with fire amen
[16:02] amen
[16:04] have you received the Holy Ghost
[16:07] fire
[16:10] amen the Lord had blessings to the
[16:12] reading of his word you may be seated
[16:15] so what are we learning there it is the
[16:17] purpose it is the ministry of the Lord
[16:20] Jesus Christ to baptize you with the
[16:23] Holy Ghost and Fire
[16:25] amen amen you can move along on the
[16:27] slides they have got certain slides
[16:29] there amen so it is the ministry of
[16:32] Jesus Christ to give you the Holy Ghost
[16:37] you've got to ask amen
[16:40] amen
[16:42] now we find that man is seeking
[16:44] spiritual fulfillment to satisfy any
[16:46] craving that he has
[16:49] and if you can testify to that spiritual
[16:51] creating amen
[16:53] he pursues religion and he devotes
[16:56] himself to that religion and that
[16:58] religion gives him a false peace he
[17:00] gives him a false hope and they believe
[17:03] as long as they continue serving that
[17:05] religion they will attain favor with God
[17:08] doesn't matter
[17:09] what kind of reward they receive they
[17:12] are even prepared to receive a reward of
[17:14] if I'm good I'll come back as an end
[17:15] I'll come back as a whatever
[17:19] they believe in reincarnation some of
[17:21] them
[17:23] some are waiting for seven virgins
[17:27] okay
[17:29] some are waiting for
[17:31] silly Rewards
[17:36] but the Lord says if you seek me
[17:38] you will find me amen
[17:42] amen is that scripture
[17:44] if you seek me you will find me
[17:47] is he going to come and just throw
[17:49] himself all over you no you must seek
[17:52] after God doesn't the Bible say Seek he
[17:56] trust the kingdom of God Amen
[17:59] there's a part for you to play
[18:02] amen a man must be born again of water
[18:05] and of spirit you'll find that in John
[18:08] chapter
[18:09] 3. when Jesus is talking to Nicodemus
[18:14] must be born of water and of spirit
[18:16] before he can achieve anything in this
[18:18] human life
[18:23] without the Holy Ghost we are living
[18:25] fruitless meaningless life that will end
[18:28] in disappointment
[18:30] to read what
[18:31] King Solomon said his life ended the
[18:34] disappointment
[18:35] he said oh
[18:37] everything is meaningless
[18:41] he says fear God and serve him
[18:44] so don't do anything further in this
[18:46] life without first establishing the
[18:48] number one most important necessary
[18:51] ingredient which is the baptism of the
[18:53] Holy Ghost
[18:58] yes the key now
[18:59] we're wondering why we can't have faith
[19:01] before you can even start to build that
[19:03] pyramid you know the statue of a perfect
[19:05] man
[19:06] you can't even start to build that
[19:07] pyramid without the Holy Ghost
[19:09] you say no brother you got it wrong
[19:11] because the Holy Ghost is on top no
[19:13] that's
[19:14] what SEALs you
[19:16] that what that's in the Capstone The
[19:18] Headstone
[19:19] so without the Holy Love
[19:22] we're wondering why people don't are
[19:24] spiritually
[19:26] healing in your faith wondering why
[19:28] things are not working out why is my
[19:30] afraid so weak why can't I succeed in
[19:32] life why am I spiritually dry
[19:35] why do I believe the message but I can't
[19:37] see any fruit or progress in my
[19:39] Christian walk
[19:41] it's because you don't have the Holy
[19:43] Ghost
[19:46] without the Holy Ghost you can't have
[19:48] faith without the Holy Ghost you can't
[19:50] have love
[19:51] without the Holy Ghost you won't have
[19:53] joy
[19:55] because what is the Holy Ghost
[19:56] righteousness peace joy in the Holy
[20:00] Ghost is the kingdom of God
[20:03] now I'm going to reiterate this because
[20:06] I am slow
[20:08] because I need to get it
[20:12] Jesus said
[20:13] seek he first yes amen what does first
[20:18] mean
[20:20] Jesus do not say that the kingdom will
[20:22] come to the predestinated Wherever You
[20:24] Are
[20:26] just lay on your laurels
[20:30] yes seek amen amen amen
[20:36] you know what happens when you seek
[20:37] something first yes
[20:42] it becomes your priority
[20:45] amen
[20:47] no
[20:48] in order to seek you have to have a
[20:50] desire right to do something now God
[20:52] does not reward the lazy
[20:54] he's not going to let you into the
[20:56] kingdom and let you see spiritual things
[20:58] in the Kingdom if you do not seek the
[21:00] kingdom
[21:00] how can we expect spiritual experiences
[21:03] if we are just lazy yes
[21:05] yes we are not dedicated
[21:07] we are not praying we are not looking
[21:10] for Supernatural experiences it's just
[21:12] not going to come and give you
[21:13] Supernatural experiences
[21:16] shall be filled amen yes Lord thank you
[21:20] so God is not going to reward the lazy
[21:23] ask yourself am I seeking the kingdom
[21:27] how diligent then are you in seeking the
[21:29] kingdom yes is it once a week he said
[21:31] I'll pass the thing whenever I remember
[21:33] yes Lord when you feel like giving me an
[21:35] experience Lord now you can't put
[21:38] experience over the world
[21:41] so much of time do we spend with the
[21:42] word amen because any experiences we
[21:46] have we have to learn it back with the
[21:47] world yes the prophet says don't run and
[21:49] take experiences over the world
[21:54] now
[21:56] laboring on the point seek Him First
[21:58] first means first not second
[22:03] is your seeking the kingdom first place
[22:06] when something is first place it takes
[22:08] all your time

[22:27] location is Jesus talking about heaven
[22:31] what does he mean when he says seek ye
[22:33] first the kingdom Jesus means seek ye
[22:35] the Holy Ghost
[22:36] because his kingdom is coming to the
[22:39] Earth
[22:39] how is this Kingdom coming by the Holy
[22:42] Ghost
[22:43] he's coming to establish his will in the
[22:45] heart of man
[22:50] now he doesn't stop there he said seek
[22:52] ye first the kingdom and his
[22:55] righteousness
[23:00] God does not use the lazy
[23:04] when God called David he was tending to
[23:06] sheep
[23:08] and he was having Supernatural
[23:10] experiences while protecting what God
[23:12] had put in charge over
[23:16] is everyone following
[23:18] God does not reward the lazy
[23:20] God does not anoint the lazy amen
[23:24] David was sending sheep when God Called
[23:27] Moses he was tending Jethro's sheep he
[23:29] was not lazy
[23:31] amen when God called Isaiah he was
[23:34] serving in the temple
[23:36] when God called Samuel he was serving in
[23:38] the temple with Eli amen
[23:41] amen when God called Elisha what was he
[23:44] doing walking in the field under Elijah
[23:47] amen
[23:49] when God called Peter Peter was at work
[23:52] amen pizza was a fisherman
[23:55] but Jesus told him because you're a good
[23:58] fisherman I'm Gonna Make You Fishers of
[24:00] Men amen
[24:02] amen
[24:03] Hallelujah God does not use the lazy
[24:06] neither does he called the lazy
[24:10] because God is looking for people who be
[24:12] workers in his kingdom amen ask yourself
[24:15] am I walking in the Kingdom amen
[24:18] I'm just here for the blessings Lord
[24:21] I'm just here for the blessings
[24:24] some people you know they say the
[24:26] Natural Touch of spiritual there are
[24:29] people who are looking for blesses
[24:33] for those of you know what that is
[24:35] there are women out there or they call
[24:37] them they're looking for blesses looking
[24:40] for men who can just spoil them and buy
[24:42] things for them without any commitment
[24:46] amen so have you been sealed with the
[24:49] Holy Ghost since you've believed the
[24:51] message of the hour
[24:53] amen
[24:55] let's go to that first quote in what is
[24:57] the Holy Ghost given for you know what
[24:58] the brother Bradham is saying here
[25:01] he said if I could only with my human
[25:03] voice placed into your heart the
[25:06] importance of receiving the baptism of
[25:09] the Holy Ghost
[25:10] it would be the most wonderful
[25:12] Revelation that you ever had in your
[25:15] life
[25:16] and he says You must do it amen
[25:24] So when you say have you believed what
[25:26] must I believe
[25:28] you need to believe on the Lord Jesus
[25:30] Christ amen do I believe just in the
[25:32] Lord Jesus Christ accept him as your
[25:34] lord and savior Redeemer coming to the
[25:37] the one who came into the world born of
[25:39] a virgin died to pay the price for my
[25:41] sin rose again on the third day ascended
[25:44] on high and when he went up he said the
[25:46] Holy Spirit
[25:48] back to the end
[25:50] and then he's coming back to receive us
[25:52] again
[25:57] amen yes
[26:03] so have you this have you been sealed
[26:05] with the Holy Ghost
[26:06] this will answer all the questions we
[26:08] have in the message when it comes to
[26:10] Ministries
[26:12] we just told you God doesn't call the
[26:13] lazy
[26:15] Lord I want to go to Nations you can't
[26:17] cross the street
[26:23] Lord if only a Time yet the 10 minutes
[26:26] you got you're idle doing nothing
[26:30] call me call me full time
[26:33] you've got half time you're doing
[26:34] nothing
[26:37] God doesn't reward the lazy
[26:39] God doesn't call the lazy
[26:42] amen
[26:44] when it comes to churches when it comes
[26:46] to the younger generation and now the
[26:48] attending message Churchill out of
[26:50] tradition
[26:51] because their parents were in a messy
[26:53] church so they follow likewise because
[26:55] it becomes a culture for them to go and
[26:57] attend the message Church
[26:59] because their father told them it's
[27:01] right
[27:03] because they have a head knowledge
[27:04] denominations are wrong we come to the
[27:06] message Church
[27:08] it will answer the question as to why
[27:10] people don't have love
[27:13] it'll answer the question why people
[27:15] don't have faith why people don't have
[27:17] joy white people don't have freedom to
[27:20] worship
[27:22] what somebody giving a testimony you are
[27:25] so dry you can't even clap your hands to
[27:27] thank the Lord
[27:29] you're not even excited for their
[27:31] testimony
[27:34] because even when something happens to
[27:36] you
[27:37] you are so dry about it
[27:40] it's my right
[27:42] if you call me his son you must give it
[27:44] to me
[27:47] so dry
[27:49] so dry you know the investment you can
[27:52] write dry on your skin
[27:56] dry in the house of the Lord
[28:01] the Bible says the fruits of our lips
[28:03] giving praise
[28:06] well if he wants my praise he must
[28:08] really work for it
[28:09] I'm not just gonna say Amen
[28:12] my amen is too precious
[28:15] I need to conserve my voice because when
[28:17] I go on my scream at my husband
[28:20] and she Shout at the children
[28:22] how can I shout in the house of the Lord
[28:24] and give him praise
[28:28] amen
[28:30] people don't have freedom to worship and
[28:33] I tell you that's another key
[28:34] as to why people don't have the victory
[28:39] when the people got the victory there's
[28:41] a shot of Praise there's a shot in the
[28:44] camp amen there's a Jubilation in their
[28:47] hearts they are giving God praise
[28:51] amen it will answer why people are
[28:54] spiritually dead spiritually lazy have
[28:57] no spiritual discipline to read the
[28:58] Bible every day and pray is because you
[29:01] have not been sealed with the Holy Ghost
[29:04] oh
[29:06] the answer to all of these questions is
[29:09] that people have not received the
[29:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost we assume
[29:13] because we go to a message church we
[29:15] think it's automatic because we believe
[29:17] the message
[29:18] Judas believe the message of the hour
[29:22] he was anointed to cast out Devils if
[29:25] you had to look at that you're saying
[29:26] wow powerful Judas
[29:30] he could cast out Devils pray for the
[29:33] sick and they were healed
[29:35] he held office in the church
[29:39] but he never went on to receive the
[29:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he sold
[29:43] out the Messiah
[29:45] in James 2 19 it says now believeth that
[29:49] there is one God that does well the
[29:51] Devils also believe
[29:54] and tremble
[29:55] people in the message believe and they
[29:57] don't even tremble
[30:00] but the Bible says demons believe and
[30:03] they tremble
[30:06] you know it's a fearful thing to come
[30:08] into the presence of An Almighty God
[30:12] how many if you can say Amen to that
[30:14] amen amen
[30:17] so believing alone is not enough
[30:20] because they are Devil's belief
[30:24] believing alone is not enough
[30:27] it is the first step
[30:29] because in Hebrews 11 6 says without
[30:32] faith it's impossible to please him for
[30:35] he that cometh to God must believe that
[30:37] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[30:40] that diligently seek Him amen what the
[30:45] one that is diligently seeking him
[30:48] men men
[30:50] yes amen you're the prophet talking
[30:54] about Peter telling you that Peter had
[30:55] been saved Peter believed in the Lord
[30:58] Peter followed Jesus
[31:00] Jesus told him who he was and told him
[31:04] to follow him he gave him power against
[31:06] unclean spirits and Sanctified Peter
[31:10] but Jesus came to a point where he says
[31:13] you are not converted Peter amen
[31:16] he said I've prayed for you
[31:18] he says after you are converted the
[31:21] prophet says he had shouted he probably
[31:23] danced in the spirit
[31:25] he had done all kinds of things but he
[31:28] hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet amen
[31:31] amen after you are converted then
[31:33] strengthen your brethren
[31:36] that's true carry out his plan
[31:40] now you say oh I'm a bit skeptical about
[31:43] you you said that I don't have faith
[31:45] because I don't have the Holy Ghost I
[31:47] don't have love because I don't have the
[31:48] Holy Ghost but let's go to Galatians 5
[31:50] and 22. if you go to an orange tree
[31:55] and you want to have some oranges
[31:59] what must you see on the tree
[32:02] you must see the fruit on the tree
[32:05] if you want the Holy Ghost
[32:07] the Holy Ghost has fruits
[32:09] amen
[32:11] but the fruit of the spirit is love
[32:15] now does does the fruit cometh when it's
[32:18] in seed form
[32:23] you can you go to the seat and say I
[32:25] want fruit
[32:28] it says the Fruit of the Spirit
[32:31] meaning that the spirit has had time to
[32:33] work in your life
[32:35] to get rid of all the nonsense in your
[32:37] life
[32:39] the Holy Ghost seed in you and time
[32:42] to make the old man die rot out amen and
[32:46] to start to grow the spiritual man amen
[32:50] and now when you are grown up there's
[32:51] fruit
[32:53] hope you're reading Way Beyond that
[32:55] scripture there when it says the Fruit
[32:57] of the Spirit
[32:59] that doesn't happen overnight you're
[33:02] gonna allow the Holy Spirit to work in
[33:03] you because you know this flesh is
[33:05] really a terrible person Enemy Number
[33:07] One doesn't want to cooperate with the
[33:09] spirit always lazy always working
[33:12] against the spirit
[33:15] so the Holy Spirit needs time to walk
[33:16] now amen
[33:18] amen spiritual discipline as you start
[33:21] to apply the spiritual discipline Lord
[33:22] I'm going to read your word Lord I'm
[33:24] going to pray Lord I'm gonna fast Lord
[33:27] I'm gonna spend time alone in your
[33:28] presence Lord I'm gonna meditate on your
[33:30] word the spirit man within you is
[33:32] growing and it's growing and it's
[33:34] growing amen
[33:35] then you'll find you got love
[33:38] you got love for your brother you got
[33:41] love for the lost you got love for the
[33:44] Raging Bull
[33:45] I'm not talking about your husband or
[33:47] your wife
[33:49] you got love for the killer bee
[33:53] you got love
[33:55] for the man who spits on your face
[33:57] in a public platform
[34:00] yes
[34:02] you got joy
[34:04] like a river I've got joy like a river
[34:08] Joy like a river in my song Amen
[34:12] amen I've got peace like a fountain
[34:15] peace like a fountain peace like a
[34:18] fountain in my soul
[34:20] the Lord must be long suffering with me
[34:25] but you've got no patience with anyone
[34:27] long suffering is the fruits of the Holy
[34:30] Spirit
[34:32] long suffering with your children
[34:36] long-suffering with the wife long
[34:38] suffering with a husband long suffering
[34:41] with the family
[34:44] gentleness
[34:46] gentleness because the holy spirit is
[34:49] like a dove gentleness
[34:52] gentle
[34:54] gentle
[34:58] goodness
[35:01] amen do we know what goodness is
[35:05] do we express goodness
[35:08] I'll scratched that person's back when
[35:11] he's touched my pet last time I asked
[35:13] him to come scratch my back you know
[35:15] what he told me
[35:16] he said you don't have time
[35:22] he says scratch David
[35:24] even if they don't scratch your back
[35:26] [Music]
[35:28] here's another one now yes wait then
[35:31] faith is hidden as number seven
[35:34] is it number seven
[35:37] faith is the Fruit of the Spirit
[35:41] I believe the youth between the statue
[35:43] of a perfect man and he started now on
[35:45] faith
[35:46] you see why you can't even get scattered
[35:49] because faith is the Fruit of the Spirit
[35:54] amen amen
[35:56] you see why you need faith
[35:59] you see why you need the Holy Ghost
[36:01] because what is this really doing let's
[36:03] finish it first meekness
[36:06] meekness
[36:08] the meat shall inherit the earth
[36:10] and then temperance
[36:13] temperance
[36:16] do you see what the Holy Ghost how it
[36:19] empowers you it actually this kind of a
[36:21] person is not a natural person
[36:23] this is not a normal person amen let's
[36:25] put the supernatural element in you
[36:28] because this you don't find in the world
[36:30] this you find impersonation of it in the
[36:32] Buddhist in the in the other Krishna
[36:34] movement and all of these things right
[36:38] and that is why we should be ashamed of
[36:40] ourselves that we even say these things
[36:42] that there are many good people out
[36:43] there
[36:45] because some of them are better than us
[36:48] but in this Holy Ghost can build this
[36:51] kind of a person in us and these are the
[36:53] fruits that now what is the fruit meant
[36:55] to do for people to eat of it
[36:58] this fruit is meant for people to eat of
[37:00] it the fruit of the spirit people must
[37:03] Feast on your love on your joy and your
[37:05] peace and your lungs are free they must
[37:07] Feast on your gentleness and your
[37:08] goodness and your faith and your
[37:10] meekness and on your Temperance amen
[37:12] they must be able to enjoy this yes amen
[37:14] that's what the fruit is for for the
[37:17] enjoyment of others help us Lord yeah a
[37:20] tree doesn't bear fruit for itself a
[37:23] free a three bears fruit for the
[37:25] enjoyment of others amen amen
[37:28] Matthew 17 our lord Jesus says wherefore
[37:32] by their fruits you shall know them
[37:35] didn't we describe that further I'm just
[37:37] thinking about this now further the Lord
[37:39] Jesus didn't he describe it when he said
[37:41] how will he know that they are my
[37:42] disciples if you eat one of their fruit
[37:45] if they have love one for another when
[37:47] you see the fruit of love one for
[37:49] another you know that these are my
[37:50] disciples amen
[37:52] amen
[37:55] so Amy and I hope I dropped that point

[43:37] pick up that quote I think I've got it
[43:38] open there to find it in 17 weeks of
[43:41] Daniel let's find out what happened on
[43:43] March 14th because I was trying to find
[43:45] my own commission for the church
[43:47] and I can find it no place but in the
[43:49] message of the hour
[43:51] so March 14th will be two years
[43:54] amen
[43:56] and this is what came up there March
[43:58] 14th
[44:01] let's just go up so they can see what
[44:04] scripture the prophet is reading it says
[44:06] now I got some writing here that I'd
[44:08] like to read to you as we go by
[44:11] the going forth of the Commandment to
[44:13] rebuild Jerusalem amen
[44:17] amen amen as the walls of the messy
[44:20] Church been torn down
[44:24] Church
[44:25] this can't be coincidence amen maybe for
[44:28] this church I can't speak as a mandate
[44:31] for everyone else
[44:33] Hallelujah men
[44:37] but the Lord is setting forth a decree
[44:39] on March 14th amen
[44:42] Amen to go and rebuild the walls of
[44:44] Jerusalem
[44:46] amen amen
[44:47] rebuild the walls of Son of Man Ministry
[44:50] because the enemy has come in like a
[44:52] flood
[44:55] but the Lord has risen up a standard in
[44:57] this day amen
[44:58] he says which day was that now the
[45:01] prophet is putting a date to it
[45:03] when that decree went forth he said this
[45:05] was the 14th day of March if any one of
[45:08] you want to put that down in the Hebrew
[45:10] you'll find it Nissan which means March
[45:13] the issue was given on the 14th day of
[45:16] March and the issue went for to build
[45:18] rebuild the Temple amen you understand
[45:22] as you people have read the scripture
[45:24] until it was completed it taken 49 years
[45:27] to complete the temple and the city to
[45:29] rebuild it
[45:32] he goes on and he says the walls and it
[45:35] will be built in trouble sometimes
[45:39] don't you feel that way
[45:41] ask the ministry we are rebuilding in
[45:43] Troublesome times if you go and read
[45:45] there what they were doing amen you know
[45:47] about sambara and all these people were
[45:49] against their building so actually when
[45:51] they got to building they had the mortar
[45:53] in one hand and they were building
[45:55] fixing an air The Sword in the other
[45:57] hand
[45:58] while they were laboring they had to
[46:00] protect themselves right
[46:03] right that's how we were living in now
[46:05] because under that photos Rider all hell
[46:08] is let loose the Bible says Hell
[46:10] Followed him
[46:12] but thank God in Revelation 10 all
[46:14] Heaven is coming down amen amen all
[46:17] Heaven is coming down to back up and
[46:19] equip God's people
[46:22] so March 14th is a very special day in
[46:25] God's Bible
[46:27] and Noah tied it in this church and
[46:30] March 14th will be a special day
[46:36] rebuilding time
[46:40] amen
[46:42] aren't you glad that the entire Temple
[46:44] is not torn down that we still have
[46:46] pillars in the house of God Amen we just
[46:48] need to rebuild amen the walls
[46:53] amen amen amen
[46:55] Hallelujah
[46:58] if it's scriptural it must be scriptural
[47:00] amen amen we must find ourselves in the
[47:03] scripture you know the prophet says find
[47:05] yourself in the scripture amen
[47:07] and he says and then you call an
[47:09] identification he says there's always
[47:11] some man something in the Bible that you
[47:13] know you can tie yourself to remember he
[47:15] went to the Bible and didn't he find
[47:16] himself
[47:20] some people identify with David some
[47:22] people identify with the prophets
[47:24] amen
[47:26] Hallelujah so we know amen that the Holy
[47:29] Ghost we can go to the next slide we I
[47:31] don't think we can have much time to go
[47:32] through all of this but we go as the
[47:34] spirit leads now
[47:35] no man could come to him say Jesus
[47:37] except the fire the first draws him so
[47:39] maybe you're asking how do I get the
[47:41] Holy Ghost you kind of shook me in my
[47:43] boots man I'm wondering if I got the
[47:44] Holy Ghost do you know the most confused
[47:46] people and the message about the Holy
[47:48] Ghost
[47:50] they don't know whether they got it they
[47:52] don't if they don't have it
[47:54] they'll give you us if I if you ask
[47:57] denomination they'll say I got the Holy
[48:00] Ghost right because they say that's the
[48:02] evidence
[48:04] am I right
[48:06] right
[48:09] and why are you laughing here
[48:12] I think they like that
[48:14] okay
[48:15] that's why they always sing
[48:20] what is the evidence
[48:22] message people have been hiding behind
[48:24] us for years
[48:26] don't know
[48:28] so they can't produce the fruit
[48:31] so they tell you no brother Brian did
[48:33] say in the end of his ministry that
[48:35] if you believe the message of the hour
[48:38] and you got the Holy Ghost
[48:41] didn't we just labor to tell you that
[48:43] just because you believe
[48:44] doesn't mean you got it
[48:48] right if you believe what are you doing
[48:49] about it
[48:57] you're walking past the house every time
[48:59] you're going past a card you're living
[49:01] your engine
[49:03] you
[49:05] for nothing but you're not doing nothing
[49:07] about
[49:09] it what are you doing about it
[49:14] sometimes she gets fed up and she come
[49:16] talk to you first
[49:17] now you think she's fast
[49:21] she can see you're a shy guy
[49:25] amen what are you doing about the
[49:27] message of the hour
[49:30] it says the holy spirit is Zoe he says
[49:34] Zoe is the holy spirit have we got it
[49:37] Zoe is the Holy Spirit
[49:41] amen he says Now watch how he takes a
[49:44] scripture
[49:45] and he reveals the scripture he says all
[49:48] that the father has given me will come
[49:49] to me and all that comes to me I will
[49:52] give him the Holy Ghost
[49:54] and I'll raise him up at the last day so
[49:56] what is he teaching us the Holy Ghost
[49:58] tells resurrection power amen
[50:03] I'll raise him up at the last day he
[50:06] says no ifs and Bucks about it
[50:08] all the times I will give him eternal
[50:10] life he'll have to raise it because he's
[50:12] got eternal life he has to come can't
[50:15] die no more than God can die if you got
[50:18] the Holy Ghost
[50:20] then you have eternal life
[50:23] he says when you accept Christ as your
[50:25] personal savior you are believing unto
[50:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:30] this is not bad this is not the baptism
[50:32] of the Holy Ghost what is he saying just
[50:34] believing is not the baptism of the Holy
[50:36] Ghost my dear Baptist Brethren it is
[50:39] wrong
[50:41] a brother said to me the other day
[50:44] I think I've carried some things here he
[50:46] says when you accept Christ as your
[50:48] personal savior okay we read this let's
[50:49] go on
[50:50] he says that's all he can do today right
[50:53] is believe God but God gave him a seal
[50:57] of circumcision amen as a sign that he
[51:00] has accepted his faith in him you
[51:02] believe unto him when he accepts him as
[51:05] you when you accept him as your personal
[51:07] savior but when God gives you the Seal
[51:11] of the Holy Ghost he sealed you to a
[51:13] Eternal destination amen so there's a
[51:16] Believing on your path
[51:17] and then there's a receiving on God's
[51:19] part when he receives your friend he
[51:23] sealed you with the Holy Ghost
[51:26] amen and there's Ephesians 4 you are
[51:29] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[51:31] create not the spirit of God Amen
[51:34] Hallelujah
[51:37] let's go on what's the next one we got
[51:39] here
[51:40] he says Beyond
[51:42] you can say Jesus is the Christ you
[51:45] [Music]
[51:49] that's the only way you know the
[51:51] resurrection is when the Holy Ghost
[51:53] Bears record when the Holy Ghost has
[51:56] come he will testify of me show you
[51:58] things to come bring these things that I
[52:00] said to your memories you'll never find
[52:02] it in the school that's what's the
[52:05] problem
[52:08] the Holy Spirit can't bring the message
[52:09] of the hour and the word of the day to
[52:12] your memories because you've got nothing
[52:13] in your memory
[52:14] you don't read the message
[52:17] you don't know the message
[52:19] so the Holy Ghost now that he's supposed
[52:21] to come and bring these things to your
[52:22] remembrance and to equip you with this
[52:24] word and to give you rapturing Faith to
[52:26] this message of the hour spiritual food
[52:28] in due season
[52:30] invisible Union
[52:32] there's nothing there that the Holy
[52:33] Ghost can bring to your remembrance
[52:35] nothing there for the Holy Ghost to take
[52:37] and work because the Holy Ghost is the
[52:39] action in you amen the Holy Ghost wants
[52:42] to work but there's no word being fed
[52:44] nothing nothing
[52:48] the Holy Ghost is the doing part in your
[52:51] life
[52:52] amen he sends him to equip the believer
[52:54] amen but you are not feeling of the word
[52:56] he's got nothing to use
[53:01] you feed the Holy Spirit by the word yes
[53:03] amen Faith cometh by the hearing of the
[53:06] word
[53:10] he says so he's talking here you know he
[53:12] spoke about his weddings that I do Holy
[53:14] Spirit that's in you amen the Holy Ghost
[53:16] in you to continue the same work that
[53:19] he's doing in Christ he wants to do it
[53:20] through you
[53:22] he says now it was the Holy Ghost in
[53:25] Luther's day the Holy Ghost in Wesley's
[53:28] day but because
[53:31] of the word it can equip them partially
[53:34] yes hear what he says here the work
[53:36] wasn't so needy in the days of Luther
[53:39] so remember the more powerful the word
[53:41] comes the more you feed the Holy Spirit
[53:43] it can Empower you great and that's why
[53:45] the end time church is prophesied to be
[53:48] a super church and a super race is
[53:50] because of the word that's come down
[53:51] amen it's the word that makes us super
[53:54] yes it's the word that equips us
[53:57] but if we are not feeding on the body
[53:59] word of the son of man the Holy Spirit
[54:01] got nothing to work with we just go
[54:04] around saying we believe the message we
[54:05] believe the message
[54:07] give the Holy Ghost food amen
[54:12] he says the world wasn't so needy in the
[54:15] days of Luda a little bit more needier
[54:17] in the days of Wesley
[54:21] the Bible says that you know men were
[54:23] getting weaker and wiser and more wicked
[54:25] all the time men do things today a
[54:28] hundred years ago you would have thought
[54:30] that being
[54:32] you would have thought that being human
[54:34] being be that cruel
[54:36] he's saying man's has gone so cruel amen
[54:39] let's go to the next slide
[54:41] so the Holy Spirit has been moving can
[54:44] you testify to them
[54:46] there was just a little breath of it
[54:48] with Luther
[54:51] a little blow of it with Wesley and a
[54:54] deeper blow of it would Pentecost
[54:58] just
[54:59] blow
[55:06] now the bread and the spirit
[55:09] has become the same
[55:11] she is uniting together bringing forth
[55:14] the same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost
[55:16] like he did back there talking about
[55:18] Pentecost
[55:20] talking about X2 now
[55:22] he's manifesting the same works like he
[55:24] did right there he's being manifested
[55:27] right today the same thing amen and I
[55:30] stand here and testify that he's the
[55:32] same yesterday today and forever amen he

[1:01:08] how many times better a million times
[1:01:12] better than all the devil could ever
[1:01:15] offer you
[1:01:19] so you notice we had to come back to
[1:01:20] this Junction
[1:01:23] is because we don't want to leave anyone
[1:01:24] behind amen
[1:01:27] have you been sealed
[1:01:29] with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:31] message of the hour
[1:01:34] since you've been baptized in the name
[1:01:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:37] have you been sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:40] don't just give me a quick answer and
[1:01:42] say yes
[1:01:43] examine your life
[1:01:46] and let's see
[1:01:48] because the Holy Ghost
[1:01:50] will desire to be filled
[1:01:52] with the things of God the Holy Ghost
[1:01:55] will feed on the word so much time
[1:01:57] you're spending with the word the Holy
[1:01:58] Ghost wants you to spend time in prayer
[1:02:00] how much of time you're spending in
[1:02:01] prayer
[1:02:03] let me tell you fathers and mothers your
[1:02:06] children are looking to you as an
[1:02:07] example
[1:02:09] they may not always tell you that
[1:02:12] but they are watching your life
[1:02:14] they're watching your testimony they're
[1:02:16] watching the things you do they're
[1:02:18] watching everything the way you talk to
[1:02:20] Mommy they're watching the way mommy
[1:02:21] talks to Daddy you're watching
[1:02:23] everything and you know what you're
[1:02:25] doing you are imprinting these things
[1:02:27] for the future generation
[1:02:29] and they say this is the way my mother
[1:02:31] and father did it and this is the way I
[1:02:33] must do it
[1:02:34] we need to project Jesus Christ in our
[1:02:36] lives if we need to project the Holy
[1:02:39] Ghost in our lives
[1:02:41] amen and lead them to spiritual
[1:02:43] experiences so that they can receive the
[1:02:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:48] it's the most precious thing we can ever
[1:02:49] have
[1:02:50] remember the prophet says if I can get
[1:02:52] you to do anything
[1:02:54] I want you to understand the importance
[1:02:55] of receiving the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:59] Ghost
[1:03:00] we know that message Church
[1:03:03] can be turned overnight
[1:03:05] into a Powerhouse
[1:03:07] into a super race
[1:03:09] into a super Church into an invincible
[1:03:13] Army
[1:03:14] because we have the most powerful word
[1:03:16] there's no word like the word that we
[1:03:18] have yes yes what's lacking is the Holy
[1:03:21] Ghost
[1:03:22] to take that word
[1:03:25] Empower you bring it to your own
[1:03:27] remembrance show your things that are to
[1:03:29] be amen amen
[1:03:32] so with sincerity in our hearts let's
[1:03:35] stand now
[1:03:36] come before the Lord
[1:03:38] and we receive the Holy Ghost since you
[1:03:41] believe the message of the hour
[1:03:43] you say oh yes I had I have received it
[1:03:46] but somewhere along the line the Holy
[1:03:48] Spirit left me
