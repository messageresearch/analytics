where we have things in common amen amen because then we can walk in one Accord amen we know we can walk Amen in Fellowship in brotherly love amen so amen now tonight I feel like a preacher with this mic you know not used to having a wireless mic so I don't know what kind of a Preacher I would be maybe I'll start walking down the aisles and stuff amen but just relaxed in the house of the Lord and we just want to hear from him amen if we can turn to our Bibles The Book of Proverbs chapter 29 and verse 18 amen the Bible says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he amen amen where there is no vision the people perish amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you may take his seats amen amen so for our topic tonight we just want to talk about walking and living in the bride's Vision amen the bride has a vision and she is walking in line with that vision amen she's living and walking in that Vision so for context we just want to take um a reading from the scripture tonight from First Kings chap 22 and verse one and we've heard this scripture been read many times and you know many stories that we read in the Bible it's been preached for years and years and we've heard the message for years and years and each season it has some meaning to us it has some benefit to us but in each season it brings forth something new amen and we can glean something new in each season to see what God is trying to say to us in that particular season amen so tonight we've read this scripture many times but we want to see in this season what God has in store for us the Bible says and it came to pass in the third year that joasaph the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel amen now we know that Jo Jehoshaphat was a righteous king and the prophet tells us here that joaz josaphat came into the wrong company when he came down to meet King haab amen yesen and the king of Israel said unto his servants know ye not that ramit in Gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria and he said unto Jehosaphat Willl thou go with me to battle to ramed Gilead yeah he's trying to influence now King Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel I am as Thou Art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses and josphat said unto the king of Israel inquire I pray thee at the word of the Lord today so we can see here that the righteousness in josaphat wants to inquire what the word of the Lord says then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together about 400 men and said unto them shall I go against ramed gillad so now we can see here the World Council of churches amen the E communal move amen that's moving in the end time and King Ahab calls his 400 prophets and he says shall I go up to Ram gillad to battle or shall I for Bear now bearing in mind that King Ahab knows that Elijah prophesied against him he knows all of these prophecies amen but he wants something soothing to his ears and we know the Bible says they would Heap up unto them El preaches with itchy ears amen so he wants to hear something good and he says shall I go or shall I forbear and they said go up for the Lord shall deliver it into thy hand of the king and Jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides that we might inquire of him amen so Joseph had kind of knew that there was something wrong here there were 400 prophets preaching in agreement but probably Jo also knew that there was a prophet Prophecy from Elijah going forth as well so he wanted to hear what the Lord had said amen so we know here that King aab says no I don't want to hear from this Prophet there is one more Prophet but he always speaks negative about me amen there is yet one man Mah the son of imla by whom we may inquire of the Lord but I hate him for he do prophesy he do not prophesy good concerning me but evil and Jas had said let not the the king say so then the king of Israel called an officer and said hasten hither M Mah the son of imla and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the entrance of the Gate of Samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them and zekiah the son of chah made him horns of ion amen bear this in mind we're going to come back to you later and he said thus say the Lord with the shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramed Gilead and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it unto the king's hand and the messenger that was going to call Micaiah spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declar good unto the king with one mouth let Thy word I pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good and Micaiah said as the Lord liveth what the Lord say unto me that will I speak amen so here we see this is why we cannot be influenced by the denominational world and the church world we know what the word of the Lord says and we can only say what the word of the Lord says amen so he came to the king and the King said unto him Mah shall we go against red Gilead to battle or shall we forbear and he answered him and here Maka starts to to mock the king a little bit and he says go and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king amen now that's exactly what the king wanted to hear but the king knew that that wasn't the truth because he said and the King said said unto him how many times shall I adure Thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord and he said I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have not a shepherd and the Lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace and the king of Israel said unto josaphat did not I tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me now look at how crazy King aab is because when Mah mocks him and tells him go up you're going to prosper he knows that is not the truth but when Mah tells him the truth he still doesn't like it amen so we're going to pause then we're going to come back to the rest of the story a little bit later on but we just want to set the context for where the story is now we know that Israel and King aab is typ in America the prophet tells us as much amen but if we look at the setting here King haab wants to go and take over ramed Gilead and he says that ramed gillad rightfully belongs to us now technically speaking he is correct amen he says when our father divided the lands it belong to us so he is right technically speaking amen and the prophet says sometimes it may sound good amen that he wants to go and take ramed gillad back and what is ramed Gilead typing in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 4 we see we see that Moses sured three cities on the side of Jordan toward the sun rising that the Slayer might flee to the which should kill his neighbor unawares and hated him not in times past and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live namely berser in the wilderness in the plain country of the reubenites and ramed Gilead in the gadites so Ram G Gilead was one of the City of Refuge amen so King haab here wants to go back and claim back the City of Refuge and now this is typ in amen America in type because we see now there's come a time where Trump comes back on the scene now and Trump now wants to start to restore Christian again in America because the prophet tells us that our City of Refuge is Christ amen there's no other City of Refuge but Christ amen our hopes are in Christ amen our peace is in Christ our Salvation is in Christ so Christ is our Ram Gilead and now America is coming to a time where they've been so backslid but there comes a man on the scene now that wants to claim back Christian virtues amen it's showing a sign of him wanting to take back ramed gillad and look now it sounds good and the prophet says this all sounds good they want to there's nothing wrong because red Gil rightfully belongs to them and we know that America was founded on Christian principles it was a Godly Nation to begin with so it sounds like a good thing a once Godly Nation back and now wants to return back to Christ amen if we can put up this the next slide there we can see slogans like this coming out we president Trump vows to bring back the Bible to life again in America amen you can see a little bit of a businessman here he says let's make America Pray Again yours for $60 he wants to sell a trump Bible for $60 because he's a businessman but what's the message America is wanting something they are hungry for something they know that they have backslid and gotten away from God right it sounds good but the problem is there's already been a prophecy gone over because Elijah the prophet has already prophesied their expected end and he's already prophesied the expected end of jel so in as much as aab wants to take back ramed Gilead the problem here is he married to Jezebel he already brought in idolatry into Israel so even though it sounds like a good thing Elijah the prophet prophecy must stand and we know that the Elijah of this time when prophesied a curse Over America he said I can't pray for them anymore because it's cursed it's gone amen the prophet says yeah they said we have prayed we have fasted these are the 400 prophets now we've got the will of the Lord thus say the lord god Jehovah go up and take it over for it belongs to us and it's ours and we rightfully have a right to it let's go get it they say let's fig that out now now mentally that's right it was given to us that's right now then prophets let's see now in our psychology our thoughts our psychic mind that belongs to us God gave it to us amen so that is why we see now even in America Christians are starting to get excited even all around the world maybe even some believers who are aen following politics more are excited that Trump is back in power because they can see now that some kind of virtue is going to be restored amen but we know that America is in Union with Jezebel with the Catholic church and according to what we are told Trump won the vote due to the Catholic vote and one of the headlines here if we can go to the next slide I like the way this headline says it Trump courted white Catholics and they helped him win the White House again I like the word it says Trump courted white Catholics what does courtship speak of a man when you're courting just like how aab came into Union Jezebel Trump showing that there's a connection now between America and Jezebel amen so this was the intention of Ahab and what better way to get America back to Salvation again than to start calling up all the denominations all these religious organizations the clergy man to back him up amen because these are the school of prophets now remember these are the ecclesiastical School of prophets for this day amen you never see any message Believers there at the inauguration amen no Mah was called there amen you have seen Trump's School of prophets now I'm saying Trump but remember don't only look at the Mana we looking at the office we are looking at America now I'm just using Trump because that's the first thing that comes to mind right but look at the office and look at the type if we can go to the next slide now very curious we see that Franklin Graham was there now who is Franklin Graham we know he is the son of bully Graham and who was The Messengers that went down to Sodom we know it was bully Graham and Oral Roberts right and now we know the prophet tells us that God takes his man of the scene but he doesn't take the spirit because we know William Brandon left the scene the angel of the of the Lord never leave the scene he's here with the elect so if Billy was taken up the scene is the Angel to Sodom still on the scene because they must be the angels of judgment that are watching Sodom remember the Angels only left when Sodom and gomorra was finally burnt up so we see Franklin Graham now and we know that amen the angel amen the same angel that was with Billy Graham most probably is still with the son amen and not only him now we using him as a type but for the old ecclesiastical movement amen but look what he says at the inauguration he says over the years Graham has been outspoken supporter of trump and his policies and has claimed that Trump was the last presidential candidate his late father voted for now remember buly Jam one of the messengers and look remember the connection between the angel and lot and lot was one of the Mayors one of the leaders of Sodom and gomorah right so we see that Trump was one of the last presidential candidates that his father voted for and he says my father knew Donald Trump he believed in Donald Trump and he voted for Donald Trump he believed that Donald J Trump was the man for this hour in history for our nation amen I think back to the angel and lot in Sodom and Gomorrah amen and we know that even you know lot was had some form of righteousness inbody he was backsliding amen but he had enough sense in in him to be against the whole Sodom uh movement amen of gays amen and lesbians and all of these things because when they wanted to come and sleep with the angel amen he said no take my daughters amen so that is why we see one of the first orders when CH comes on the scene is he signs an order to say we only recognize male and female champ is against this whole gay and lesbian movement amen we can go to the next slide one of the other ministers that was there Lorenzo su he words were such we are grateful that you are the one that has called him for such a time as this now who uses these words all along you remember we type Esther and we always say God has preserved us for such a time as this but they are recognizing that in their part of scripture and they part of Prophecy they have been preserved for such a time as this amen and notice he says that America would begin to dream again remember we spoke on Sunday about Joseph and his dream amen because the bride is walking in her dream in her vision but everyone to come into their and their vision and prayed for a day when all Americans regardless of race or religion could join together Here's Your World Council of churches now your your movement where they trying to unite everyone when we Let Freedom Ring we will be able to speed out that day when all of your children black men and white men Protestant and Catholic Jew and Gentile will be able to sing in that meaning of the old Negro spiritual so you see what they intention is is to come together amen and to unite together and we know that the tears are being bundled up amen now the prophet says well all of them with one Accord has come and prayed over a thing they fasted and prayed and he's made two great big horns he's positive he's got the word of the Lord so he said come up before the king and took these big horns and said by this you are going to push the syrians right off the go the God God's ground and we're going to possess God's possession now here the prophet is talking about these two horns and we know this takes us back to Revelations 13 verse 11 amen it says and I beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth we know that this is America now and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first Beast before him and causeth the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly Hound was healed the prophet tells us the two horns like a lamb not a lamb and he says what is it it's the American buffalo see there he is the two horns like a lamb but then what did he do he had freedom of religion and the prophet says now lamb has two horns and that's civil and ecclesiastical Powers but when they United remember then the lamb spoke like the dragon did before him him and the dragon was wrong so when we see these two Powers civil and ecclesiastical Powers uniting amen Prophet says that's when we see he starts to speak like a dragon and we can see now once again the church and state is starting to unite again just like he did back then with Rome amen when Rome United Church and States amen just like Jezebel did now aab is doing the same thing so these this this main Prophet here is I think his name is he's saying to Ahab you are going to take these two horns basically these two Powers the civil and ecclesiastical powers and you are going to win this war with that amen now you notice as I said earlier on we've we we preach these things for years and years but in each season God revealed something to us Amen in that time and season and we know which this is this much is true that Mah comes down the scene they call Mah right and notice how they start to say to Mah and start to kind of D him a bit and say look we're going to make you some great person today you're going to join now this great movement you're going to come up to all our high dignitaries you're going to come before these great two kings and please watch how you speak basically they are saying to him you say what they are saying and if you do that you are going to prosper and if you do that you are going to be blessed but Mah tells them I will only say what the Lord tells me to say notice the boldness of Mah it it sounds a lot like the bride has thus said the Lord or she keeps still you know even though they are trying to flatter him with all of these things but Mah is confident because remember Mah knows the message of Elijah amen and we know that Elijah's prophecy that had gone out was that aab aen was going to be killed he was going to come to an end and he said the dogs were going to lick his blood amen and he said the same thing to Jezebel amen and notice when this is happening now as I said it's happening at a specific time when aab wants to take over ramed Gilead so the setting is perfect now when America once again wants to restore their Christian virtues there must be a makah on the scene that amen comes to their position as well amen now let's let's just read a bit in the scripture and just follow this along when may when Mah comes along he says to them then he said I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no Shepherd and the Lord said these have no master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace and the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good good unto me but evil now let's pay attention here in verse 18 He says again he said therefore hear the word of the Lord I Saw the Lord sitting upon his throne and all the host of Heaven standing on his right hand and on his left now what is this in a time where aab is going to take over ramed Gilead Mah is on the scene and a door is opened up unto him a door to a supernatural realm where Mah is caught up now into realm and he sees the heavenlies this door is opened up unto him amen and he begins to see God and his throne and he sees a council is being held am amen and what season are we living in we know here in 2025 we are the word of the Lord doors are starting to be open when at a time when America wants Ram gillad wants the City of Refuge back doors are starting to be open amen and here the door is open to Micah and notice what he seees he sees the Lord on his throne and he sees the host now what's the host we know that's the Angelic realm so in other words Mah is not coming into connection with the Angelic realm amen and we know the bride in this hour is connected to the Angelic realm we know the door has been opened up to the bride to a supernatural realm in this hour am amen and notice that's not the only door that's been opened he says and the Lord said who shall entice Ahab king of Israel that he may go up to fall R Gilead and one spake saying after this manner and another saying after that manner then they came out a spirit now here's the second door being open the Demonic World amen amen what two doors were open we know in 2025 God's door Amen to the supernatural world and the de demonic world we know the pope started to open these doors Amen to the Demonic world and Mah is beginning to see these Spirits coming up before the Lord and he said I will entice him and the Lord said unto him where with he said I will go out and be a Lon spirit in the mouth of all these prophets see what Spirits now controlling these modern day preachers and the Lord said Thou shalt entice him amen and thou shalt also Prevail go out and do even so so we see the setting here now how at a specific time doors are being opened up to Mah and we know Mah is typing the bride amen and is caught up in the message of Elijah amen he's caught up in the shout message of Elijah amen and that is why now Mah's Vision has to match Elijah's prophecy because amen if we look at it this way if we can say it this way Mah is caught up in this seven seal mystery because when he's caught up he meets the seven seal himself he Hees God Seated on the throne amen and he starts to see the hor Riders because he see these EV evil going out to entice amen what were the hor riders for going out to deceive the Nations amen so in other words Mah is caught up and the seals are open to him because he's caught up in the in the message of Elijah amen and so these doors are being opened unto him and who catches the Revelation in this hour am man Mah the type of the Bride she is the one that catches the Revelation in this season amen the doors are being opened up unto her she can re the Demonic World being open she can recognize the Angelic World being opened up in this hour amen now here is where we want to see that you know we can throw out our catchphrases here we say that Mah's Vision amen had to match Elijah's prophecy but I want to draw a distinction micaiah's Vision was not Elijah's Vision Mah's Vision did not contradict Elijah's Vision but Micaiah had to have his own vision because Elijah's Vision was the dogs are going to lick your blood amen now Mah could have stayed happy with that and he could have come and repeated the same thing to aab and he could have said the dogs are going to lick your blood Mah wouldn't have known that this is the season for Elijah's prophecy to come to pass because when you are waiting for a prophet's prophecy to come to pass you wait for it to come to pass and then you say this is that which was spoken by Elijah the prophet but because Mah was caught up in his own Vision he could say to Ahab if you return at all this day the Lord has not spoken to me he could now take Elijah's prophecy and say this day is going to be fulfilled because I know that the Lord showed me this amen and he could say to them amen if you return at all the Lord had not spoken to me amen and this is why in the message we got to watch we all these catch trases uh catchphrases say what the tape says amen Push Play Amen these terms amen why it is true that we need to say what the tape say that does not mean verbatim quote what the prophet is saying every time you got to have your own Vision you got to the bride has her own Vision she has her own Ministry amen it's completely different from the vision of Elijah but yet it's the same because it does not contradict Elijah amen maa's Vision brought Clarity to Elijah's prophecy because Elijah had a prophecy the dogs were going to lick your blood but micaiah's Vision showed how it was going to happen amen micaiah's Vision was able to see in that higher Dimension how the Lord is bringing Elijah's prophecy to pass amen and that is why in this hour and my title for today is that the bride is walking and living in her vision amen she is not walking and living in a vision of 50 years ago amen she is caught up in the message of Elijah but she is hearing directly from the Lord she is getting fresh manner from the Lord amen amen she's not restricted and saying I'm only quoting the words of William vanam amen now we see that is being the problem Amen in the church world today or should we say in the message world all these years is because people were caught up in the message of William Branham which was the first phase amen and which is necessary but then they did not come to the stage where they are walking in their own Vision where they have a connection to the Angelic realm where they are having the vision for themselves and walking in the vision of the Lord for themselves in this hour amen because William Brandon prophesied many things over this bride amen but you can stay content with just hearing the prophecies but until you come to the stage where you are walking in the vision amen and then you are the Fulfillment of Prophecy in your day amen then it does not do you any good just to quote the Prophecies of William Branham so and that is where Mah found himself and we know the bride is under a prophetic anointing amen because in Revelation we know in Revelation 10: 8 to 11 11 the Bride is a prophetic Ministry amen and the bride is called to prophesy again but notice when the bride is called to prophesy again she is caught up in her own Vision because remember John is typing the bride right and John in the first phase of his ministry was following his messenger which was Jesus Christ amen he was groomed under the ministry of Jesus Christ and he followed that message but they had to and and under that message the John's Ministry was just to relate the events of Jesus Christ and what Jesus Christ came to do amen but there came a time when John was caught up in the spirit there came a time when John was caught up in a vision amen and he began to identify himself amen and after the church ages is coming to an end in Revelation 3 in Revelation 4 Johnny is caught up amen and then John now is starting to walk in his own visionen and when John begins to do that now he comes into contact with a mighty Angel and then the mighty Angel hands in the book and saying now thou must prophesy again amen amen and then when he's walking in his own Vision that's when he's prophesying again now you see got you got to you got to match the the types right because the prophet said if you don't match it right you're going to have your picture wrong amen you're going to have the cow eating grass from on top of the tree so in order to match that type of Mah amen you've got to come into your own Vision you've got to he directly from the Lord now let me ask you this in 2023 2024 and 2025 who revealed to us amen the connection to the Angelic world who revealed to us in 2024 sharing in his glory who revealed to us in 2025 doors being open was it William Brandon or was it the bride walking in our own Vision amen the bride is beginning to walk in her own Vision she's beginning beginning to have this connection to the Angelic realm where she can hear directly from the Lord and notice even though she's walking in her own Vision her vision does not contradict the message of William brandom in fact it is only bringing Clarity and making the prophecy of William brandham come to pass amen so we believe amen that this is a season opened up unto the bride where she is now progressing from hearing Elijah's prophecy to hearing from the Lord Lord and getting a fresh word and vision in season and a vision and word will match William brandom's prophecy amen amen amen I'm trying to skip a lot because I want to I want to get to the point of the message so that we don't uh amen make it too long because amen when you if you can get to the point of the message there after I will years just start to di down amen so we see over the years amen the bride amen all they could do amen before the bride comes into a vision all she could do was relates William R's prophecy that is why you see such excitement when we see certain events coming to pass we see maybe we see a driverless car being invented everyone gets excited they start posting on Facebook they start posting everywhere this is William Brandon's prophecy they saw Hillary Clinton run for office they got excited they said this is William Brandon's prophecy they saw Kamala Harris run for president they got excited they said this is the prophecy then Trump wins the election and they say no the Catholic church was the woman that the prophet prophesied about why because all she can do is relate Bron's prophecy if she's not walking in her own Vision then she cannot determine with Clarity when his prophecy comes to pass amen if she's only relating his prophecy only when it comes to pass then she can say this is that which Brandon prophesied but when she is walking in her own Vision then she knows in season what God is doing she doesn't have to get excited at every headline amen we find some message people are headline message Believers as soon as we see something the Facebook feed gets flooded with message quotes say man we saw it in the Los Angeles Fire as soon as the fire started all the quotes started flooding Facebook about William Brandon's prophecy amen and sometimes we even see you know it's sad to see some believers who cannot do proper research they start to post fake news because they start to PO post fake pictures you you see it in the Los Angeles fires they started to post all kinds of things like the Hollywood sign on fire those are fake pictures and those leave room for critics such as people like believe the sign to come now and criticize us amen why because some Believers are just headline believers they get excited for these things but they they're not walking in vision and in line with the spirit to know what's happening in season and that is why you know the Bible says we read in the beginning where there is no vision the people perish amen and that is why over the years we see amen the bars been let down amen what is it people letting sin coming into the message we see all kinds of sin and false teachings and eight Messengers and even to the extent of seeing uh homosexuality treatment in the message and alcoholism and all of these things why is this a people living or a people perishing it's showing signs of a people perishing why they're not walking in Vision cuz where there's no vision the people perish now as I was saying you know we relates every time Revelation 10: 11 and how the bride must prophesy again and every time you know some people they think that's just coaching the prophet and that is why you get movements now like just press play and so forth now can you imagine that the bride has to walk in her own Vision where she hears directly from God because there is no disconnection between the groom and the bride the bride and groom is not in Union now can you imagine Rebecca after being married to Isaac and coming into Union with Isaac imagine her conducting her household now and she goes to the servants and say Ela told me this and this and this do this and do this it would sound crazy to them because she's now married to Isaac she's under the headship of Isaac El's message was only to get her to Isaac and to open up the communication between her and Isaac but now that the communication is opened up between her and Isaac amen she's walking in that Vision she hears directly from a groom amen and this is the point we are getting to is when you have Elijah's prophecy amen you don't know exactly when the vision comes to pass but our vision that we speak matches his prophecy amen it does not contradict it one B amen and notice Micaiah said to them if you return it all today the Lord has not spoken to me amen notice he did not say if you return at all the Lord has not spoken to Elijah he said if you return at all the Lord has not spoken to me amen he had confidence in what the Lord spoke to him and you've got to have confidence in what the Lord speaks to you youve got to have confidence in Your Vision amen you now when I say Vision don't mistake me to only mean the gift of Prophecy and the gift of Sina I'm talking about the vision of your life the goal the purpose you year that God puts you here on Sunday even Joseph had his dream that was the purpose of his life that was the vision for his life amen so I'm not just referring to a gift of Prophecy and and and just seeing a vision now I'm referring to the vision for the bride her goal her purpose and we know that the bride even though it's a body of Christ it's an individual walk so what is the vision of your life you need to walk in the vision of your life amen and you need to be confident in what God is speaking to you yes amen amen and then that extends to the local church when God is speaking here in the local church you need to have confidence in what God is saying for your season in your local assembly amen and then that extends to the fivefold word while where the bride has to have confidence in what is been coming through the fivefold because that's the vision of the Lord for this day amen that is why the prophet said these young men will come on and make sense of this message and carry this message on because they got to walk in season and vision amen and we know we've been heing for the last few weeks about our vision amen and walking in that vision and we see that this is the season amen that's opened up unto the bride now we want to go to amen Daniel and we see that Daniel Amen believed amen the message of Jeremiah because he if you notice Daniel was here in captivity and Daniel says I know from reading the Scrolls amen he says I've learned from reading the Scrolls whose Scrolls were there Jeremiah the prophet that we were going to be here in captivity for 70 years so in other words Daniel had the prophecy of the messenger Jeremiah but there come a time and season where Daniel needed to hear from the Lord himself because for as long as he has believed in the prophecy of Jeremiah he did not have Clarity amen of when they were going to leave so he needed to hear from God himself and so Daniel we know begin to fast and pray he begin to wait upon the Lord and what happened by doing that God started another counseling Heaven just like how in Mah's time God had a counsel in heaven and notice here again in season this door is open up un Daniel a supernatural realm is opened up unto him Angelic visitation amen and not only Angelic visitation from the Heavenly realm Daniel now is also exposed to the prince of the power of the air because the angel is telling him that amen he's defeating and he's going back to fight amen the Prince of Persia these doors are being opened up to Daniel and it's bringing Clarity to Jeremiah's prophecy now look at this right Jeremiah just prophesied that they were going to be there for 77 for 70 years but but now when Daniel walks in his vision look at the clarity now he's given exactly what the Lord is going to do from that point right until the end of time Amen in other words Daniel's Vision extends far into eternity amen just like how Elijah's prophecy was just that the dogs were going to lick your blood but micaiah's prophecy brought Clarity and so that is what the prophet William Brandon meant when he said these young men will come on and make sense of this message and sweep it onto the coming of the Lord amen because when the bride is walking in a vision and walking in connection with that realm she is able not to discern the signs of the times amen amen now let's read what the prophet says and he said who can we get to go down there and deceive Ahab amen and bring him out there in the field so he can get killed to fulfill the word of Elijah and the prophet says Glory Hallelujah how God will stand behind his word that was a prophet that said that who was Elijah right but Jesus said now he's bringing it to us if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said when you know it's the word of the Lord speaking that's why I could say to that woman that had a big tumor to the lady with the cancer here tonight the different ones because first it's a vision notice now the prophet says it's a vision it comes it Compares with the word he's the same yesterday today and forever there's the vision then it happens it's thus say the Lord and it has to happen nothing can stop it now it had been a long time since Elijah had made this prophecy it's been years since William brandham prophesied over this bride he'd been in glory a long time amen William vam has been in glory a long time now but he would he made his made this prophecy and he know it was coming to pass and then Micaiah knew that Elijah was a man of God here was God up in heaven holding a counsel up there how to bring the word of Elijah to pass and if you got the word of the Lord and will speak the word of the Lord and don't doubt the word of the Lord God will hold a council meeting to make your word come to pass amen amen when when the bride has thus said the Lord amen when she speaks to this mountain amen the prophet is saying God will hold a counsel in heaven Amen to bring your word to pass amen I remember we remembering prayer requests amen but we've already spoken a word over those prayer requests amen our pastor Ruben Daniel we've already spoken a word amen that it must dry up from the roots amen our brothers like brother Danver and so forth we've already spoken a word amen amen and the prophet says God will hold the counsel in heaven to bring your word to pass now I want you to notice how powerful that is amen when you are speaking a word you are not just speaking a word like a normal human being amen but when you are speaking you are speaking as a Son of God you are walking in line with your vision and your vision does not contradict Elijah's prophecy because Elijah's prophecy said you will be a super Church you will be a super race you will be an invincible Army but now you are walking in line with your vision and when you speak when you prophesy again God will hold a counsel Amen to bring your words to pass amen God even goes to the extent amen of bringing up the Demonic world and says who will go before us to deceive Ahab amen God will go to any extreme measure to bring your word to pass amen that is how powerful your words are so I want you to notice any word that you have spoken over your life maybe in times past and maybe it's been tearing we know the book of Hab habac amen though the vision T amen it will come to pass amen why you've spoken a word and God is bringing things in order amen God is instructing the Angelic realm God is using any measure to bring your word to pass amen hallelujah amen that ought to make us rejoice amen because that ought to know the power that lays within us amen that just at the speaking of our word amen it is instructing Angels amen because the angels are ministering Spirits in this hour to the a of Salvation amen so when you speak a word amen amen the angels are being instructed Amen to go forth amen because when Daniel begin to wait upon the Lord amen and when Daniel needed instruction amen God sent his messenger amen God said Gabriel amen and when Micaiah amen waited upon the Lord amen he could see amen what the Lord was doing amen hallelujah and notice God brought both Elijah and micaiah's prophecy to pass amen and God will bring both William bram's prophecy and the prophecy of this end time right to pass amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen ain't it good amen when we know our word is backed up amen the words that we speak amen like God when he speaks he says my word will not return unto me void amen that is why when a Son of God speaks like God Amen his word will not return unto him void amen hallelujah now let's let's ask ourself in the season amen why are doors being opened up why in this particular season doors are being opened up the Book of Matthew 7 says ask and it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that ask it receive it and he that seeketh find it and him that knock it shall be open so why are doors being opened up in this hour because there's been a people from 2023 that's been knocking on the door amen there's been a people that been consecrating themselves in the year 2023 saying Lord we want to experience a supernatural Lord we want a connection to this Unseen World knocking on the door amen and then come 2024 Lord we want to share your glory amen Lord to him who ascending the hill amen will share in his glory knocking on the door amen and God says okay fine since you've been knocking my word must come to pass if you knock the door shall be opened up unto you that is why in this season the doors are being opened up Amen to the bride that is why in this season whatever you say shall come to pass because the door has being opened up unto you amen God is not a liar amen we heard that on Sunday God is not a man that he should lie if you knock the door must be open amen if you are Desiring a connection to the Unseen World he that hunger shall be filled amen hallelujah so that is why these doors have been opened there's been a people amen that is why in the time of Daniel God sent his Angel because Daniel was crying out amen that is why in the time of Egypt God sent his messenger deliverer because the people were crying out and the cries come up to the Lord hallelujah when God's people begin to cry out God sends an answer am thank you Lord so we see Jesus as well lived in a world of perfect Faith amen Jesus lived in a world of vision Jesus was walking in the vision of himself amen and that is why his ministry was so powerful he said I can do nothing except I see the father do likewise and the prophet tells us he has living in a world of perfect Faith living in a world of vision and if the bridegroom lived in a world of vision the bride has to do likewise if she is born of his bone flesh of his flesh word of his word Spirit of his Spirit then she too must live in a world of vision that is why Joel 2: 28 says in the last days you young men will see Visions you old men will dream dreams amen walking in their Vision the prophet says well how could he do anything else because he tested his vision with the word of God and notice when you are walking in season and in vision your vision you must match it up to the word of God and that is why any doctrine that comes must match up back to the word of William brandham and the word of God Amen and you know that the word of God that said to Abraham amen about Elijah and how the dogs will lick their blood amen Micaiah had based his faith upon the vision first notice you base your faith upon the vision of yourself first and then he took his vision and compared it to the word of God so when God reveals something to you you got to have confidence in it and then how do you can have more confidence is you take it and match it up with the word of the Lord then he know he was right that's the way you ought to do it if our theology will take the word of God and the things that we do and he DB taals Through the Bible completely with the Bible That's All Right amen he said you'll see someday so Mah was so confident in his vision amen that when the Prophet ezekiah this false prophet came to him and said which way did the spirit of the Lord leave me when God spoke to you Mah was so confident in his vision and he said you'll see someday sitting there Elijah prophesied it and maka's vision compared with the word of God Micaiah could not have faith unless his vision compared with the word of the Lord amen so in this season when we are walking with god let's always make sure that our vision goes back to the word let's Don't Drift Away from Elijah amen maybe some might misunderstand me when I say our vision we must walk in our own Vision but I'm saying our vision must dve tail with Elijah amen we can't stay away from Elijah amen we can't stray away from the word of the Lord amen we see as I said before John as well was caught up in vision and we see how the prophet said Jesus said to them what is it to you if he terries talking about John now and the disciples ask what what's going to happen to John and he says what is it to you if he terries until I come till I return what is it and the disciples made a mistake they said that Jesus said that he was going to live till the coming but Jesus didn't make no mistake right here in Revelation ch 4 Christ kept his word he brought John up into heaven and rehearsed the whole thing to him he saw the preview he saw it just as though he lived on the earth and he saw the whole church Ages come to pass to the coming of the Lord the whole book of Revelation see John was walking in the vision of that amen even though he did not live to see the literal Return of the Lord but he was caught up in this vision and he lived in that Vision we noce Mary amen we coming to the climax of the message amen we notice Mary there had been a prophecy for hundreds of years 400 to 700 years that a virgin was going to conceive and in the time of Mary that was the message for their day because week in week out the priest will read a virgin shall conceive a virgin shall conceive and they were expecting and waiting for the Messiah so in other words the prophet's prophecy of virgin shall conceive type that now with Elijah and his prophecy because there's been a prophecy that this bride is going to conceive as well and bring forth the word made flesh in this hour now Mary could have believed that prophecy all through her life as she was growing up but he would have done no good for her until the door was opened up in season to Mary to come into connection with an Angelic realm and the Holy Spirit overshadowed her and that's when she could say be unto me and now as Mary's conceived in her and she's walking in a pregnancy for 9 months she's walking in a vision all the years she was hearing the prophecy of Isaiah a virgin shall conceive a virgin shall conceive but now she's walking in the vision amen you don't have to refer back anymore to Isiah a virgin shall conceive now you look at Mary and say Here's the vision walking in flesh amen that is the hour now that the bride is in amen you don't have to refer back to Malachi's prophecy anymore because here's the bride walking in flesh amen and notice amen when Mary conceived amen and then he she brought for the child the vision now extended to Jesus the word made flesh and he began to walk in the vision of his day amen the vision just continues extending [Music] amen amen we know that she gave birth Amen to the word made flesh amen the walking vision of her day amen hallelujah now notice the Pharisees when Mary was walking in her vision the Pharisees believing the message of their day which was a virgin shall conceive was still preaching the same message every week that a virgin shall conceive a virgin shall conceive but here is the Virgin who already conceived in fact she already even gave birth to the word made flesh but the message Believers of those day was still quoting no a virgin is going to conceive a virgin is going to conceive that is why you got to recognize in this hour that the bride is already bringing forth the word made flesh you can't keep on referring back to what the prophecy was you got to look at what the prophecy is now amen the bride is produced the word made flesh in this hour she's walking vision of that amen if not you just take on a Pharisee spirit amen amen hallelujah amen let's go Amen to the next slide just to climax here amen how many of you recognize what this is this is the titles of the last five messages that's been preached Amen in our assembly amen starting off with expectations visions and declarations for you in 2025 notice how the spirit of the Lord is speaking in the hour amen don't just come to service week and week out and just go back realize what the Lord is doing realize where the Lord is positioning us amen in a Time amen where America typing a once Jam gillad back noticed the bride coming into her vision first message amen of the Year expectations visions and declarations for you in 2025 second message I we able to discern the signs of the time like William Brandon Mah was able to discern what Elijah had spoken and therefore he could walk now in his vision amen the third message God's Watchmen in the end times amen notice Elijah and Mah The Watchmen of that hour amen the bride now the prophet was the Watchman back then and the bride now takes on the Baton from the prophet amen The Watchman in this hour who can prophesy again and say what is to come amen the next message a spiritually successful man of vision see how the Lord is directing us to walk in Vision amen Sunday's message after 25 years Grace meets Perfection talking about Joseph and the Fulfillment of the dream remember dream and vision is the same thing amen Joseph was living in his vision amen all through the years the vision was tearing tearing tearing but he was living in it and they come in our way it come to pass amen and he was living in the Fulfillment of that after 25 years and tonight walking and living in the bride's Vision amen after 25 years amen the bride is starting to walk in the Vision thou must prophesy again amen super race super Church all of these prophecies the bride is walking in our vision amen I pray that that's being a blessing to you amen we may take our stand to our feet amen hallelujah the bride is Walking In Step she's walking in vision of the hour amen she's not just refering back though it be good though it be true though it be thus say the Lord to refer back to William Gram's prophecy but she is now the Fulfillment she's walking in her own Vision amen of the hour and a vision does not contradict the word of the Lord amen hallelujah thank you Jesus we worship you blessed be your name hallelujah oh we can see in this hour oh God where each character is starting to take their part we see America on the scene we see Jezebel and the scene we see all of these different players but the most most important character in this hour is the bride amen and the chess boy the most important person next to the king is the queen amen and the bride in this hour is the most important piece and so if everyone else is coming into their part they're walking in their Vision notice America is walking in their Vision the Catholic church is walking in their Vision amen now the bride is also walking in our vision hallelujah oh Lord let us be prepared in this hour let us recognize oh God let
