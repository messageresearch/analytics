[0:02] so Genesis 24 we'll just read a portion
[0:04] of scripture
[0:05] here and Abraham was old and well
[0:08] stricken in
[0:10] age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in
[0:13] some
[0:14] things all things all things amen and
[0:19] Abraham said unto his eldest servant of
[0:21] his house that ruled over all that he
[0:24] had he has a man walking in authority of
[0:27] everything he's walking in Dominion
[0:29] Authority of Abraham's belongings put I
[0:32] pray thee thy hand under my thigh so
[0:35] that is the way they made a covenant and
[0:37] he's not swearing by any man he says I
[0:39] will make this way by the
[0:41] Lord the god of Heaven and the god of
[0:44] the earth that thou shalt not take a
[0:46] wife unto my son of the daughters of the
[0:48] Canaanites among whom I
[0:52] dwell so this is now looking for
[0:54] Marriage
[0:56] Partners amen but Thou shalt go unto my
[0:59] country to my Kindred and take your wife
[1:01] unto my son
[1:03] Isaac so the servant hears this I'm a
[1:05] swear by the Lord and he says but
[1:08] Venture the woman will not be willing to
[1:09] follow me unto this land must I needs
[1:11] bring thy son again unto the land from
[1:13] whence thou camest and Abraham says
[1:17] beware that thou bring not my son to the
[1:21] again you see we can't go back to
[1:25] idolatry come out of her my
[1:27] people and we ought not to be going back
[1:31] yeah amen don't ever take him down there
[1:35] the Lord God of now he's going to reveal
[1:37] a hidden Mystery to him because remember
[1:41] Abraham is walking in perfect faith and
[1:43] he's receiving Supernatural Revelation
[1:45] from the Lord and he's going to reveal
[1:47] his Revelation now he's saying the Lord
[1:49] God Of Heaven which took me from my
[1:52] father's house and from the land of my
[1:54] Kindred and would spake unto me and that
[1:57] swear unto me saying unto thy SE I will
[2:00] give this
[2:01] land amen he shall send his Angel before
[2:04] thee amen
[2:07] amen he shall send his Angel before
[2:10] thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my
[2:13] son from
[2:15] den and if the woman will not be willing
[2:18] to follow thee then Thou shalt be clear
[2:20] from this my oath only bring not my son
[2:23] F again amen and then now the servant
[2:27] after he's hearing of the supernatural
[2:29] revelation
[2:30] and who's revealing the mystery of God's
[2:32] will to him he's willing now to put his
[2:35] hand under the
[2:36] thigh and he says and the servant put
[2:39] his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
[2:41] master and swear to him concerning that
[2:43] matter amen and the servant took 10
[2:45] camels of the camels of his master and
[2:48] departed for all the goods of his master
[2:51] were in his hand and he arose and went
[2:54] to Mesopotamia unto the city of nul Amen
[2:58] let's just read one more scripture and
[2:59] set the SE and he made his camels to
[3:01] kneel down within without the City by a
[3:04] well of water at the time of the evening
[3:07] even the time that women go out to draw
[3:09] water the Lord had blessings with the
[3:11] reading of his word you may be
[3:13] seated
[3:15] amen praise the
[3:18] Lord hallelujah
[3:25] amen so we've been through the previous
[3:27] chapter and we see how Abraham had come
[3:30] through his greatest
[3:32] test and Abraham called it worship to be
[3:36] obedient to the word of God is called
[3:39] worship amen amen so we know that was
[3:43] when he was asked to sacrifice Isaac and
[3:46] he passed the test with flying
[3:50] colors
[3:52] amen he pass the test with flying
[3:58] colors amen so much so that this man was
[4:01] taking a knife to plunge into his son a
[4:04] angel has to call out from the angel
[4:05] doesn't even have time to come from
[4:07] Heaven he has to scream from
[4:10] heaven so serious was Isaac I mean
[4:13] Abraham the angel has to scream out from
[4:16] heaven and tell him Abraham stay thy
[4:18] hand
[4:20] amen amen we've been through that last
[4:22] week amen hallelujah so now he comes
[4:25] down from the mountain with Isaac as he
[4:28] spoke and the lad will
[4:31] return amen and he's walking in Victory
[4:34] now he's the master of all circumstances
[4:37] he's walking in perfect faith and
[4:39] calling those things that are not as
[4:41] though they are and he speaks like
[4:44] God Amen so we find time progresses and
[4:48] in Genesis 23 we read about the death of
[4:51] Sarah and how Abraham secures a burial
[4:53] sight for her amen so we find that time
[4:57] passes even further and now Abraham is
[5:00] concerned about Isaac because it's
[5:02] Abraham's responsibility to see to it
[5:05] that Isaac marries the right type of
[5:07] girl yes yes the right woman so that the
[5:12] seed line will continue and he can
[5:14] become the father of many
[5:16] nations amen right now he only had one
[5:21] son but God said you'll be a father of
[5:23] many nations he told him look to the
[5:25] stars look to the sand so shall your
[5:28] seed be
[5:30] so he knows there must be a progression
[5:32] in order for the seed line to progress
[5:34] he must find a wife for
[5:37] Isaac
[5:39] amen so when Abraham approaches this
[5:43] he's very specific and he is not appaz
[5:45] it in the way that he goes about
[5:47] searching for the bride for Isaac so
[5:51] this title here you can title it finding
[5:52] the Bride of Isaac finding the Bride of
[5:54] Isaac amen so he's not appaz in finding
[5:59] Isaac wife
[6:01] amen he knows that if God was so precise
[6:05] about the bedding ground in which Isaac
[6:07] would come
[6:10] through amen that it had to be through
[6:13] Sarah then the type of woman that Isaac
[6:16] marries will also be of utmost
[6:18] importance am so he has to make a
[6:24] decision and Abraham as you know has the
[6:27] mind of Christ and he knows what he
[6:29] wants with the word
[6:32] yes and is not to marry from other
[6:36] nations young men young women you're not
[6:39] to marry from
[6:45] denominations but now he has to make a
[6:47] decision I don't want to go back to
[6:50] Babylon I don't want to send Isaac down
[6:52] there to who will I
[6:54] send he's got to make a decision amen
[6:58] amen amen hallelujah yes
[7:01] Lord so we in this
[7:05] decision it says here amen if you go for
[7:08] the that first slide at the same time
[7:10] Abraham was determined he did not want
[7:12] his son to marry an unbeliever that
[7:14] would be a good decision for Christian
[7:16] today who are Sons and Daughters of
[7:18] Abraham to make the same decision about
[7:21] their
[7:23] children I I thought the son must choose
[7:26] I thought the daughter must choose
[7:29] brother Brandon please rephrase that
[7:31] okay let me rephrase it for brother
[7:33] Brandon it would be a good decision for
[7:35] Christians today who are Sons and
[7:37] Daughters of Abraham to make the same
[7:39] decisions about their children
[7:43] amen
[7:45] amen Abraham had to make a decision but
[7:48] Abraham did not want his son connected
[7:50] with that kind of
[7:53] stuff I wonder what kind of stuff I you
[7:56] know brother Brandon really had to
[7:57] elaborate there he'll tell you what kind
[8:00] of
[8:01] stuff amen stuff on the face stuff on
[8:05] the nose stuff on the ears amen amen
[8:10] they are full of
[8:12] stuff amen that's unbelief so so great
[8:16] is the stask that Abraham appoints the
[8:19] stask to his most trusted servant the
[8:22] one that was going to become the heir to
[8:24] all things if Isaac was not born the one
[8:27] that was born in his own household amen
[8:30] amen the one that was like an adopted
[8:32] son you don't make somebody your a if
[8:35] they're not your adopted
[8:37] son so elas is an adopted son he's a Son
[8:41] of God he's a spoken word Son of God
[8:45] walking in power and authority amen amen
[8:48] he commands Abraham's Kingdom and he
[8:51] tells the servants what to do is in
[8:53] charge of the
[8:55] household so the servant elizer has been
[8:58] trained in the house all these years for
[9:00] this specific time for such a time as
[9:03] this now Eliza must step forward to
[9:06] fulfill his greatest role in Abraham's
[9:08] household yes amen all the other years
[9:12] were years of preparation all the other
[9:14] years out in the Evangelical field amen
[9:17] under the first and second pool with
[9:19] just years of preparation but he was
[9:21] waiting for a message amen
[9:25] yes yes Lord now that the promised son
[9:28] was here Isaac and was of age to be
[9:31] married elzar's main purpose of his
[9:34] ministry is to be revealed
[9:37] amen the prophet will say so the time
[9:39] has been allocated to every man to make
[9:42] his
[9:44] decision whether he's a preacher or a
[9:46] prophet or a church member or what more
[9:48] he's got to make a
[9:50] decision and he decided that elizar was
[9:52] the selected one because he had found
[9:55] elizar to be a trustworthy servant he
[9:57] had been loyal and true and upright and
[9:59] just and honest that's the kind of a
[10:02] servant that God can pick to take a
[10:04] message from him to the
[10:08] church what kind of what kind of servant
[10:11] if you read there a loyal servant a true
[10:14] servant an upright servant a just
[10:17] servant an honest servant amen that's
[10:19] the kind of messenger god can use
[10:23] amen amen amen why to bring a message to
[10:27] the church
[10:29] now Elm has also make a decision if he's
[10:32] going to trust his five senses to make
[10:34] the decision or if he's going to trust
[10:36] his six sense and connect with the
[10:38] supernatural world and help him to find
[10:40] the bride for
[10:44] Isaac we also have decisions to make
[10:47] will we go in the caral way or will we
[10:50] connect with that
[10:52] angel will we ask for divine
[10:54] intervention in our decisions can we go
[10:57] in on our knees and pray and say Lord
[10:59] I've got this decision to make but I
[11:02] don't want to make it alone based on my
[11:04] human emotions and five senses won't you
[11:07] step in on the scene and bring me
[11:09] Angelic assistance amen you see the
[11:13] angels of God are here on Earth is
[11:14] ministering spirits to the Airs of
[11:16] salvation but they are sometimes
[11:19] unused they are sometimes unwanted
[11:22] services but if you in a time of need
[11:25] you can call and say Lord send the
[11:27] angels of the Lord
[11:32] amen
[11:34] hallelujah so El is has to make a
[11:38] decision amen whether he will trust his
[11:41] own taste about a
[11:44] woman he's got his own taste in a
[11:47] woman
[11:48] amen now most people if they would
[11:52] approaches from a caral point of view
[11:54] they would think that Ela is a young
[11:56] person Ela is not a young person
[11:59] remember he was already there and was
[12:00] going to be the heir of all things
[12:02] before Isaac was born so now Isaac is
[12:04] approaching 40 years old and he needs to
[12:07] get married so Ela is not a young
[12:11] man amen my point of telling you that he
[12:14] was not trying to flirt with
[12:17] Rebecca he had no desire to flirt with
[12:19] the bride
[12:21] am and neither did our
[12:26] Prophet amen
[12:29] so the prophet says sometimes we got to
[12:32] let God speak to us yes Lord help take
[12:36] God's decision of who should be when you
[12:38] who you'll come into fellowship with you
[12:40] see what he's saying there you need to
[12:42] take a decision who you'll come into
[12:44] fellowship with who's your close circle
[12:46] of friends who's the one that's
[12:48] influencing you who's the on that you
[12:50] spend time with you'll have to make a
[12:52] decision about
[12:54] that your parents can advise you your
[12:57] friends can advise you amen the pastor
[13:00] can advise you but ultimately you will
[13:02] have to make the
[13:04] decision and birds of a feed the flock
[13:07] together you find you hang around with
[13:09] dogs you get it
[13:11] fleas
[13:14] amen hallelujah yes and sometimes I
[13:18] wonder why our young people hang around
[13:21] with
[13:22] unbelievers they're my neighbor they're
[13:25] unbelievers do not be unequally yolked
[13:29] with unbelievers how can two walk
[13:31] together oh but we have such a good time
[13:33] laughing laughing about what
[13:36] yes we just have a good old time here we
[13:39] laugh about
[13:41] anything you'll be laughing in Hell
[13:45] together why don't you come laugh with
[13:47] us amen enjoy the things of God and
[13:51] Sarah says the Lord that made me to
[13:54] laugh amen yes
[13:57] amen
[14:01] Hallelujah he says I don't care what
[14:03] level it's on come anyhow let God
[14:05] speak you see he's speaking in a certain
[14:08] level this morning but are we hearing
[14:10] the voice of God Amen now it says here
[14:14] it was coming about evening time when he
[14:16] came to the well near the city and it
[14:19] came about the time that Rebecca had to
[14:21] make a decision so Abraham made a
[14:23] decision Ela made a decision now Rebecca
[14:26] makes a decision and he says I believe
[14:28] believe the angel of the Lord beat him
[14:32] there about half
[14:33] hour amen
[14:37] amen amen yes Lord I believe the Ang
[14:41] this this is the Angel of the
[14:42] Lord
[14:45] amen is there seven angels in this
[14:47] picture as
[14:49] well cuz the Angels formed the
[14:53] wig amen yes some people believe these
[14:56] are were the theophanies of the seven
[14:58] Messengers
[15:01] they preach it as
[15:03] Doctrine but I have you know theophanies
[15:06] don't have
[15:08] wings and the prophet says great Wings
[15:12] the one on the right with the swept back
[15:15] Wings swiftly
[15:17] flying
[15:20] amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[15:24] Seven
[15:25] Angels formed the wig yes
[15:29] amen seven angels formed the wig so he's
[15:33] coming now about the time of evening and
[15:36] why am I saying that he says I believe
[15:38] the angel of the Lord beat him there
[15:40] about half an
[15:42] hour right so this is preaching 1959
[15:46] before the event happened yes in
[15:50] 1963 so brother BR Khan make these
[15:52] things up because you know that the
[15:55] Angels appeared there before he went
[15:57] hunting
[16:02] the picture was taken February
[16:04] 28th the prophet was hunting about a
[16:07] week
[16:08] later so the angel of the Lord I don't
[16:11] know why people have built up this
[16:13] picture in the head that the angel must
[16:15] only come there when the prophet is
[16:16] there they wrote the
[16:19] story they wrote the story so it must
[16:21] happen according to their time
[16:25] line so now when the prophet is telling
[16:27] them the angel appeared there half an
[16:29] hour early
[16:31] ah we want it to be according to our
[16:34] story so they have a revised
[16:37] version amen so he says I believe the
[16:39] angel of the Lord beat him there about
[16:41] half hour for he will send his angels
[16:44] before thee for what that makes the way
[16:48] clear yes amen that's
[16:51] right thank you you see because people
[16:54] do not understand what's happening in
[16:56] the spiritual world right the Angels had
[16:59] to come and prepare the way yes clear
[17:01] out all other demonic forces that were
[17:03] coming to oppos it
[17:06] yesen we think it's all an Dory Prophet
[17:09] going here Prophet going there going to
[17:11] rescue the boy who was going into his
[17:13] Cham uh to be on death row there and
[17:16] then he he missed being there on time
[17:18] and all of these things hunting season
[17:19] wasn't open God has fixed all things
[17:24] perfectly hallelujah amen hallelujah
[17:29] God will send his angels before you then
[17:32] makes the way clear and it must have
[17:34] been the angel of the Lord that spoke to
[17:36] Rebecca's heart and said go get to the
[17:39] water yes and Rebecca came to the Water
[17:43] of Life at the evening time
[17:46] amen now how many if you know that God
[17:48] works on both ends
[17:54] yes how many of you know that God works
[17:56] on both ends amen if you are praying
[17:59] about something he's working on the
[18:01] other end to bring it to
[18:04] pass so when Abraham had this desire in
[18:08] his heart to find a bride for
[18:11] Isaac Rebecca was Restless in her part
[18:14] of the
[18:15] country she didn't want to stay in
[18:17] Babylon she had a desire to leave that
[18:20] place none of the men of the city
[18:22] interested
[18:24] her the Bible says she was very
[18:26] beautiful she was to look upon and she
[18:29] was a virgin no doubt she was of age to
[18:32] be married and she may have been
[18:34] receiving
[18:37] proposals but nothing within a
[18:40] connected
[18:42] amen
[18:46] yes
[18:47] Hallelujah nothing within a
[18:50] connected amen now who is Ela for those
[18:54] of you that don't know Eliza is a type
[18:57] of the Prophet yes
[18:58] amen amen who at evening time now the
[19:03] Lord Jesus Christ has got a bride on the
[19:05] Earth but they are trapped in
[19:08] denominations yes and trapped in systems
[19:10] of this world that he must send a
[19:12] prophet with a message get her
[19:16] amen amen you know the prophet had that
[19:19] Vision or not Vision sorry he had a
[19:21] physical experience where he was feeling
[19:24] down in his spirit and he needed
[19:26] confirmation of his ministry and he
[19:28] opened up the Bible to Genesis 24 to ELA
[19:32] the faithful servant and he says my eyes
[19:34] fell upon the scripture and he says go
[19:36] hunt my bride amen and he says that has
[19:39] been the confirmation that this is my
[19:41] messag amen amen then he sees a preview
[19:44] of The Bride amen hallelujah you'll find
[19:48] it on the slides there amen if you
[19:49] search for it there you'll see he has a
[19:51] preview and in this preview he sees the
[19:54] bride but the last bride is getting out
[19:56] of step and he says it's all to my min
[19:58] Min to keep her in Step Amen to keep her
[20:00] in line
[20:03] amen amen praise the
[20:07] Lord amen thank you now years
[20:12] eler he approaching the the well and
[20:16] he's about to meet this woman at the
[20:18] well
[20:19] amen and he's coming
[20:22] now and you know he took 10
[20:25] camels 10 camels
[20:29] is to let you
[20:30] know you are supposed to know the hidden
[20:33] mysteries of God that this is typing
[20:35] Revelation 10
[20:39] amen 10 camels of his
[20:42] master amen and he made the camels kneel
[20:45] down without the City by a well of water
[20:48] at the time of the evening amen so this
[20:51] woman something within a tells her like
[20:53] you said there now the Lord works on
[20:55] both
[20:56] ends right something within her tells
[20:59] her it's time for you to go to the
[21:03] well now when you hear that voice you
[21:06] got to obey
[21:10] it amen brothers and sisters we need to
[21:13] be sensitive to the Angel's voice in
[21:15] this
[21:16] hour we can't be walking around ignorant
[21:19] and saying I got this feeling and I got
[21:21] this you got to be so in tune with the
[21:23] spirit am yes amen hallelujah
[21:28] because God doesn't let me say it this
[21:32] way God doesn't always work where you're
[21:35] going to hear an audible voice he
[21:39] he go he into the city
[21:43] no was the prophet when that sister who
[21:47] recognized herself as a shunamite woman
[21:50] was he even aware of what was happening
[21:51] and he says Lord she she said Lord I am
[21:54] your shunamite woman where is your
[21:56] Elijah you think the Lord said now I'm
[21:58] going to ground this plane my Prophet
[22:01] I'm going to ground this plane there's a
[22:02] woman in need here in the city and I'm
[22:04] going to ground this plane just excuse
[22:06] the turbulence here but I'm going to
[22:08] ground this plane and you are going to
[22:10] have to walk a few city blocks until you
[22:12] come to this woman and you will find a
[22:14] woman standing on the corner of the
[22:16] street if he didn't work for the prophet
[22:18] that
[22:21] way you need to be sensitive to the
[22:24] spirit if the prophet didn't obey the
[22:26] voice he could have stayed in the
[22:28] airport he could have been frustrated
[22:30] and said oh now this turbulence is wind
[22:32] now is grounded the
[22:34] plane but he knew how to walk in the
[22:37] spirit now so another reason why we
[22:40] won't be able to hear the spirit's voice
[22:42] is because we have so many other voices
[22:44] in our
[22:47] ears amen we allow ourselves to be

[26:04] that thou has appointed for thy servant
[26:06] Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou
[26:08] has showed kindness unto my master amen
[26:13] amen
[26:16] hallelujah and it came to pass before he
[26:19] had done speaking so God working on both
[26:23] ends before he was done speaking he's
[26:26] still making his prayer
[26:28] he is still speaking the
[26:31] word and it says behold Rebecca came out
[26:35] which was born to bethuel son of milka
[26:37] the wife of n Abraham's brother with a
[26:40] pitcher upon her
[26:42] shoulder and the damil was very fair to

[28:17] Journey for eler to come along that
[28:21] way we just spoke about the supernatural
[28:23] world do you not think he would have
[28:24] faced every obstacle along the way yes
[28:27] he was going to find a bride for Isaac
[28:29] you think they didn't face obstacles
[28:31] along the
[28:32] way treacherous
[28:34] conditions resistance they were thieves
[28:37] they were robbers yes but these were
[28:39] also well- trained servants they dealt
[28:41] with five Kings and their armies amen
[28:43] they were fighting a spiritual battle
[28:45] and they had come here at evening time
[28:49] amenallah you see when we read the story
[28:51] weting they walk straight out of
[28:52] Abraham's house and they came there now
[28:54] they're so fresh and they're there
[28:56] now
[28:58] but try and and find the meaning of the
[29:00] story put yourself in there yes amen

[29:05] and you'll see that they maybe have been
[29:07] tied in the journey amen but he's so uh
[29:10] determined to fulfill the commission
[29:12] that he goes about to praying at evening
[29:15] time amen hallelujah and early in the
[29:19] morning you know this woman comes out
[29:21] and then she draws water and what did we
[29:24] just read there the angel of the Lord
[29:26] was hooing her to the
[29:28] waters calling her to the
[29:31] waters hallelujah amen she didn't know
[29:35] that all night was 10 camels and the
[29:38] Servants of
[29:39] Abraham outside there
[29:43] waiting
[29:47] amen and she AC it
[29:50] so the servant ran to me and said let me
[29:52] I pray thee drink a little water of thy
[29:54] picture and she said drink my Lord
[29:58] and she hasted now she said drink my
[30:02] Lord that was what he asked for
[30:04] right but here's the second part and she
[30:08] a it let down the picture upon her hand
[30:10] and gave him to drink and when she had
[30:12] done giving him a drink she said I will
[30:15] draw water for thy camels also until
[30:18] they have done drinking amen
[30:21] amen hallelujah amen
[30:24] amen oh praise the Lord amen amen praise
[30:28] the Lord yes amen hallelujah now just to
[30:32] tell you what this
[30:35] means a camel drinks 60 gallons of water
[30:40] one
[30:42] camel
[30:44] right so if I had to convert it in
[30:48] liters
[30:59] there was no h
[31:01] pipe

[31:06] work she's running down to the well
[31:09] coming back up putting it there for them

[31:14] and down 60
[31:19] times

[31:24] character that he was looking for for
[31:28] someone was able to catch the hidden
[31:30] part of the mystery the unspoken part
[31:33] amen and she was fulfilling it of her
[31:35] own accord somebody who could do the
[31:37] Greater
[31:39] Works amen amen a young girl a beautiful
[31:44] girl Not Afraid Amen to get dusty and
[31:47] dirty and run up and down to the well
[31:50] and

[31:55] camels What would these
[31:58] beasts the prophet says they represent
[32:06] Powers what was she doing refueling her
[32:09] own transportation yes
[32:12] amen is the message of the hour our
[32:15] transportation yes amen what was she
[32:18] doing giving life back to the
[32:21] camels
[32:23] amen water is
[32:25] life she was giving life back to the
[32:28] camels and when you and I amen obey the
[32:32] message of the hour we are giving life
[32:34] to the message the
[32:39] power the power that's going to take you
[32:41] to your Isaac oh yes you know without
[32:45] you the message is
[32:47] dead so who is giving life to the
[32:50] message
[32:52] amen that's what she's doing she is
[32:55] giving life to the camels
[32:58] has the deer panted for the
[33:01] waters so animal you know where they
[33:03] need water she's giving life to the
[33:06] message how are you serving the message
[33:08] are you giving it
[33:10] life are you giving it
[33:14] power are you allowing the message to
[33:16] take and have an effect on
[33:18] you
[33:21] amen she is giving life to the
[33:25] message she is running back and forth 60
[33:29] times going getting water coming and
[33:32] throwing and this like I'm going to
[33:35] reiterate the prophet never asked her to
[33:37] do
[33:38] it I only do what the tape
[33:42] says I don't have my own personal
[33:45] ambition to go out and do something for
[33:48] the
[33:49] Lord the prophet says I must lay in the
[33:52] presence of the sun to be ripened so I
[33:54] will just lay here and be ripened
[33:58] I will not have any concern for other
[34:00] people and go do an
[34:03] Outreach I got this one quote lay in the
[34:05] presence of the sun to be
[34:07] ripened am I
[34:09] right I can't see myself I'm laying here
[34:12] you know when you laying you can't see
[34:13] yourself unless you got a mirror on the
[34:16] roof now people are laying there and
[34:19] preachers like me are coming around to
[34:20] tell me you are not right and they
[34:22] getting
[34:23] offended you are sunburnt sorry not
[34:28] you instead of getting ripened you got
[34:33] sunburnt because you left the vine there
[34:37] was no life
[34:38] flowing you know in order for the fruit
[34:40] to be ripen you must still be attached
[34:42] to the vine you must still be attached
[34:44] to the tree some have gone on no I'll
[34:47] detach myself from this tree I'm going
[34:48] to listen to the tape at home I'm
[34:51] lightening
[34:55] here
[34:59] amen they're ripening at
[35:04] home do you know why they ripen at home
[35:07] they don't want a a present tense Holy
[35:10] Ghost who is able to discern what
[35:12] they're doing right now and call it
[35:14] out because when it's coming from the
[35:16] tape it's always about another person
[35:19] the prophet was talking to them not us
[35:22] back in the day can't be
[35:25] us he Lord
[35:30] amen so she's responding to the unspoken
[35:34] word he never asked her to feed the
[35:37] camels she said I will feed the camels
[35:40] also and she got to work amen
[35:45] hallelujah the bride has the mind of
[35:47] Christ and she knows what he wants done
[35:51] with the word so if there was nothing to
[35:53] be done why would he make that
[35:55] statement he knows what she wants done
[35:58] with the
[35:59] word
[36:04] amen and the man was wondering at her
[36:06] held his peace to with whether the Lord
[36:08] had made his journey prosperous or
[36:12] not and it came to pass as the camels
[36:16] had done drinking so it must have been
[36:18] quite a sight for him right to watch
[36:20] this that the man took a golden earring
[36:23] of half a shekele
[36:25] weight and two bracelets for a hand of
[36:28] 10 shekels weight of
[36:31] gold and said whose daughter are thou
[36:33] you must still find out now whose
[36:35] daughter she is just the sign alone is
[36:37] not good enough there's lots of women
[36:40] out there performing signs
[36:43] hello lots of churches out there
[36:46] performing signs wonders and
[36:47] miracles so the sign alone el is was not
[36:51] convinced with the sign
[36:54] alone what did he do he pour out the
[36:58] gifts he pulls out the
[37:01] gifts a type of the church
[37:04] world but he wants to place the gift
[37:06] upon her and he says whose daughter are
[37:09] thou pray I pray thee is there room in
[37:12] thy father's house for us to Lodge
[37:15] in and now she identifies herself I am
[37:18] the son I am the daughter of Bethel the
[37:20] son of milka which she bear unto n she
[37:23] said moreover unto him we have both
[37:25] straw and provender enough and room to
[37:28] Lodge
[37:34] in the Beast needs power to make the
[37:37] journey back but the Beast can't survive
[37:40] on water
[37:42] alone so there's a further ministry
[37:45] under
[37:46] Rebecca I hope you get
[37:48] this to give the message life amen
[37:53] amen amen not only water
[37:58] yeah she is telling eler we have
[38:02] Str and provender I don't know that's
[38:05] probably some cattle
[38:07] food and a room for you to Lodge in and
[38:11] the man bowed down his head and Worship
[38:13] the Lord that was a sign amen bringing
[38:16] the message of the hour into your
[38:20] home
[38:22] amen thank you bringing the message of
[38:25] the hour into your home
[38:27] and letting it live feeding it not just
[38:31] finding a room he says I have a room for
[38:35] you is there room in your heart for the
[38:37] Lord I have room in there for you thank
[38:41] you Lord amen
[38:46] hallelujah
[38:49] amen so he worships the Lord and he says
[38:52] blessed be the Lord God of my master
[38:54] Abraham who had not left us destitute my
[38:56] master of his mercy and his truth amen I
[39:00] being in the way the Lord led me to the
[39:02] house of my Master's Brethren amen so he
[39:05] starts to recite all of these things and
[39:07] Rebecca had a brother and his name was
[39:08] Laban and Laban ran out to the man and
[39:11] it came to pass he saw the
[39:14] gifts hearing and bracelets upon his
[39:16] sister's hands and when he heard the
[39:18] words of Rebecca his sister saying thus
[39:21] spake the man unto me that he came unto
[39:24] the man and behold he stood by the
[39:26] camels at the
[39:27] well and he said come in thou blessed of
[39:30] the Lord wherefore standest thou without
[39:33] for I have prepared the house and the
[39:35] room for the camels and the man came
[39:37] into the house and he unguarded his
[39:39] camels and gave straw and provender for
[39:42] the camels and water to wash his feet
[39:45] and the men's feet that were with
[39:48] him and there were set meat before him
[39:50] to eat but he said I will not
[39:55] eat until I have told my errand and he
[39:59] said speak on you see sometimes you go
[40:01] to people's house you got an urgent
[40:02] business they say no no don't worry just
[40:04] eat
[40:06] first eat first then we'll talk they say
[40:10] no we'll talk first then we'll
[40:14] eat doesn't matter you traveled in the
[40:16] wilderness
[40:17] Journey get the business out first amen
[40:20] then you know if the that conversation
[40:22] didn't go too well now you going to
[40:24] eat you have to leave
[40:28] amen so don't be an hypocrite now have
[40:31] the meal and everything first then
[40:32] you're going to tell them something
[40:34] now things are not working out
[40:37] yet tell them first and
[40:41] leave amen praise the
[40:45] Lord let's get back to the message amen
[40:48] that was just reading there the Bible
[40:55] amen
[40:57] the prophet is telling us that when we
[40:59] are making decisions in
[41:03] life we can't make
[41:08] decisions that are based on
[41:10] nothing it must be secure decisions
[41:13] trusted decisions so he find he says
[41:16] there's times when you have to make hard
[41:19] decisions maybe in your midle middle
[41:23] age you have your last earning ni
[41:26] talking about finances here and you put
[41:28] a little here you put a little there you
[41:30] got to a place maybe that the money has
[41:32] to be invested somewhere you've got a
[41:35] decision to make where you will put that
[41:37] money and before you invest that money
[41:41] you'll first find a place where it's
[41:43] safely
[41:44] put maybe this is happening for a reason
[41:47] right now the Lord don't want you to
[41:49] make foolish
[41:50] decisions yeah the prophet is giving you
[41:52] advice he says we have things today that
[41:55] just get rich over overnight invested
[41:57] here and tomorrow you're a millionaire
[41:59] but you wouldn't put your money in such
[42:01] a place as that because it's your life's
[42:03] earnings
[42:05] amen but what will you do with sober and
[42:09] sincerity you'll search for an Old
[42:11] Reliable firm that's been tested and
[42:13] proved one that's safe and there you'll
[42:15] invest your money because you don't want
[42:18] none of this fly by
[42:20] night and if you're that sincere and
[42:22] concerned in your decision about your
[42:24] life's earning how much more sin should
[42:26] you be about your religion and your
[42:28] salvation amen we shouldn't go for some
[42:31] of these little fly by night ideas or
[42:33] put your name on the church book and
[42:35] shake hands with the preacher that won't
[42:37] work amen he says I would recommend you
[42:40] tonight to an Old Reliable institution
[42:43] that was founded on the day of Pentecost
[42:45] when the Holy Ghost came down to dwell
[42:46] among men it was the most reliable firm
[42:49] that I know of to invest your soul amen
[42:51] and your future in eternity in an
[42:53] oldfashioned Pentecostal experience
[42:57] amen it's been time tested and proved to
[42:59] be the truth 2,000 years hasn't changed
[43:02] a bit and the same dividends that was
[43:04] paid off at Pentecost is still being
[43:06] paid off by this firm amen yes inflation
[43:10] hasn't caused God to give you a lesser
[43:13] Holy Ghost yesen thank
[43:16] you no matter amount of attack by demon
[43:19] powers has made the Lord amen withdraw
[43:23] his power from the church it's the
[43:25] people that have restricted the power of
[43:27] God from flowing through the church we
[43:30] need to clear out all channels and be a
[43:32] conduit for the power of God yes amen
[43:36] amen amen there is no wireless
[43:44] electricity brother Caleb is there
[43:46] wireless
[43:48] electricity you've got to be connected
[43:50] to the source yes you've got to be
[43:52] connected to the power yes amen amen
[43:58] Hallelujah people want to operate I'll
[44:00] connect
[44:02] wirelessly I'll connect
[44:05] wirelessly
[44:06] amen people are so backslid they don't
[44:09] want to go to church I'll stream the
[44:11] service so they are connecting
[44:13] wirelessly to the
[44:16] service now the angel doesn't have
[44:19] confidence to come in your home but the
[44:20] angel of the Lord is in the church now
[44:22] you can't connect with his anointing you
[44:24] can't connect with his presence
[44:26] amen hallelujah amen right now I suggest
[44:30] you stop resisting the spirit of God and
[44:32] you start to embrace the spirit of God
[44:34] and you allow the angel of God to work
[44:36] through you so that he can touch you
[44:38] even now yes amen
[44:42] amen hallelujah 2,000 years it hasn't
[44:45] changed a bit yes the same power the
[44:48] same anointing amen amen yes
[44:51] Hallelujah and the same dividends that
[44:54] was paid off at Pentecost is still being
[44:56] paid off by this firm the gift of the
[44:58] Holy Spirit the power of healing to see
[45:01] Visions Angels appear to you yes Lord oh

[45:30] here and something within her began to
[45:32] tug and say yes I can feel his presence

[45:38] you see if you if you understood there
[45:40] there wasn't only 10 camels and some
[45:41] servants traveling through the
[45:43] Wilderness there was Angelic forces
[45:45] because the Abraham said I shall send my
