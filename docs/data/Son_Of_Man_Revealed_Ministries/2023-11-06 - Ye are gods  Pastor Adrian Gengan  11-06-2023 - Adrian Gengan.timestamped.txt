[19:36] about you see
[19:37] faith will make you believe things your
[19:40] mind knows nothing about faith looks to

[20:00] and so forth and and take big blowers
[20:03] and blow the sand up and they put
[20:05] foundations down and build homes build
[20:07] highways they build beautiful structure

[20:12] an amateur creator
[20:15] man has not stopped creating
[20:17] he's gone God permissive world but he's
[20:20] still a creator
[20:21] and even though he doesn't possess the

[20:47] thousand years ago a bird still builds
[20:50] the same kinds of nist if fish still
[20:52] spawns in the sand the monkey still

[35:56] instead of really coming out and facing
[35:58] the issue there's something wrong

[36:04] Twisted the people's minds it needs to

[46:22] Thunders to awaken me yes amen
[46:26] amen hallelujah
[46:29] what so we we saw what took man away
[46:31] from his Dominion right it was sin
[46:34] follow me now I do have a thought train
[46:36] of thought what brings us back to
[46:38] Dominion it's Redemption
[46:40] says in Leviticus 25 verse 23 you get
[46:44] the laws of redemption the only one way
[46:47] that it can be redeemed it's by a near
[46:49] Kinsmen the only one who can rightfully
[46:52] redeem it this poor man lost him if this
[46:55] poor man if a man got poor lost anything
[46:58] to another man only way it could be
[47:00] redeemed would be to a near Kinsman this
[47:03] man holds it for a certain amount of
[47:04] time but it must come back to the
[47:06] original owner
[47:08] Miss
[47:10] amen
[47:13] Hallelujah
[47:15] this is what we have in the birth of
[47:17] Jesus Christ
[47:19] thank you
[47:21] you'll get it now what do we have back
[47:24] in the birth of Jesus Christ
[47:27] what he said
[47:28] if if somebody takes something away from
[47:31] you
[47:34] It's Only Hell for a season yes
[47:37] until the time of Jubilee comes around
[47:39] amen
[47:40] amen amen you're gonna get it now
[47:44] amen yes but when Redemption comes
[47:48] it must go back to its original owner
[47:52] let me break it down for you the
[47:54] original thought was for Adam to
[47:56] reproduce himself by the spoken word
[47:58] amen
[48:02] but because of sin it went back to
[48:04] somebody else
[48:07] reproduction went to somebody else
[48:10] the nature of the law but what does he
[48:12] say here
[48:14] we have it back
[48:16] um
[48:18] and Joshua preaches a few weeks ago if
[48:20] you remember we have it back in the
[48:22] Virgin birth of Jesus Christ
[48:25] to the power of the spoken word amen no
[48:28] sexual act yes the Holy Spirit
[48:31] overshadowed Mary amen amen so at the
[48:34] time amen didn't Jesus say this is the
[48:37] acceptable year of the Lord the time of
[48:39] Jubilee had come
[48:40] yes amen so the original thought of God
[48:43] for man to reproduce by the spoken word
[48:45] had to come back amen and we have it in
[48:48] the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ and
[48:50] that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:52] does sets a man across the chasm again
[48:54] so now it puts you across another chasm
[48:57] amen now you're across Satan can't get
[49:00] to you the only way that he can get to
[49:02] you he must be justified sanctified
[49:06] filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:08] amen that is your brother and then he
[49:10] can come to you
[49:12] amen but Satan hates the things of God
[49:15] so if Satan is your brother
[49:17] then you are still in his territory yes
[49:20] amen amen amen I don't want to go about
[49:23] that other one about somebody who's
[49:24] being your father-in-law and
[49:25] mother-in-law and things like that right
[49:28] you know the joke
[49:30] now watch he says here you must be
[49:33] positive amen and you stay there until
[49:36] you are positive yes so you must be
[49:39] positive but he's telling you if you've
[49:41] got a little bit doubt in that
[49:42] positivity stay there till you become
[49:45] positive amen say the word till you're
[49:48] positive yeah
[49:50] you say brother you're speaking on Mark
[49:52] 11 23 for long hair I'm staying in it
[49:54] till you are positive about it amen yes
[49:58] stay there until you're positive they
[50:01] nothing can turn you yeah amen amen
[50:07] if Moses under the blood of animal blood
[50:11] could have so much creative power in him
[50:13] he spoke flies
[50:15] we've been through these 10 plagues he
[50:17] spoke Waters turning into blood
[50:19] amen you spoke Locust
[50:21] he spoke leprosy he spoke boils amen
[50:27] under the blood of bulls and goats how
[50:29] much more powerful under the blood of
[50:31] Jesus Christ amen yes
[50:34] amen
[50:36] hallelujah amen he says God uses men God
[50:40] could have used mint God could have used
[50:42] a son to preach a gospel God could have
[50:44] used the wind to preach the gospel but
[50:46] God chose men to preach the gospel
[50:53] there again we're going to do some
[50:55] Diagnostics what's the matter with the
[50:57] church today there's something wrong my
[50:59] opinion we're not coming with the
[51:01] sincerity to the right thing for that
[51:05] for what for that that God should power
[51:08] we're not coming with the right
[51:10] sincerity if God could do that by blood
[51:13] of bulls and goats
[51:15] that only covered sin and made a
[51:17] propitiation for The Sinner but the sin
[51:19] was still there
[51:21] what can he do through the blood of his
[51:22] son that omits him amen God is Not
[51:25] manufactured but he has created a blood
[51:27] that takes away all sin
[51:29] and Mark 11 23 when you say to this
[51:32] mountain you see how he's tying it back
[51:34] to that scripture
[51:35] he's showing you how the blood puts you
[51:37] back there
[51:38] the blood puts you back as an amateur
[51:40] God thank you Lord Oh The Blood of Jesus
[51:42] don't sing about the blood brother we
[51:44] pass the blood
[51:50] the blood releases it
[51:53] the blood made way for Pentecost
[51:58] amen the blood omits sin God is Not
[52:01] manufactured but he created a blood that
[52:03] takes away sin then directly quotes Mark
[52:06] 11 23 whatsoever you see what whatever
[52:09] you say to this mountain move don't
[52:11] doubt in your heart but believe what you
[52:13] have said will come to pass you can have
[52:15] what you said amen where's the
[52:17] Pentecostal church today you don't
[52:20] realize that confess truly confess sin
[52:22] amid sin if there's no amen it builds a
[52:26] bridge across the chasm takes man back
[52:29] into the presence of his creator and
[52:31] makes him a Son of God Amen
[52:33] amen he that believeth on me the works
[52:36] that I do shall he do also amen verily I
[52:38] say unto you if you say to this mountain
[52:40] be moved he quotes it again but believe
[52:43] what you have said
[52:44] you can have what you have said it's my
[52:47] God revealing himself in humility amen
[52:50] amen thank you Lord God takes a humbling
[52:53] sinner cleanses him by his blood
[52:55] dropping the confession into the Clorox
[52:58] bleach amen hallelujah we read all of
[53:00] that amen this is just another quote he
[53:03] talks about Elisha going Elijah going up
[53:05] dropping the Rope for Elijah he got a
[53:07] double portion the work that I do shall
[53:09] you do also and greater than Lee shall
[53:12] you do for I go to my father again he
[53:15] asked what's wrong Church yes
[53:18] it's a finished work amen
[53:21] amen
[53:26] now here's the answer
[53:27] I believe you're ready for the answer
[53:34] amen
[53:36] you've got to get away from your own
[53:38] thoughts yes you've got to let the mind
[53:41] that was in Christ be in you amen amen
[53:44] you've got to stay there till every sin
[53:46] of fear
[53:47] every sin of Doubt has gone from your
[53:50] heart
[53:51] amen and if you're there
[53:54] and God doesn't take you in admit that
[53:56] sin and send you into the presence of
[53:58] God there is something wrong with your
[54:00] experience
[54:05] God hiding himself in humility revealing
[54:09] himself in power that's the way God does
[54:11] it that's God's program of doing it yes
[54:14] sir that he may bring Sons across the
[54:17] sheasm oh thank you Lord

[55:07] hey
[55:09] sometimes we even say hey thank God I'm
[55:11] saved otherwise I fell off
[55:15] you see what he's saying look at what's
[55:17] hindering it is it coming back to a life
[55:21] godship
[55:23] because all of those things are
[55:24] negativity yes negative forces

[1:12:10] anchored to us we should never speak
[1:12:12] till we believe it then when we believe

[1:14:41] redeeming price if we believe it if you
[1:14:44] believe it he that believeth on me the
[1:14:45] words that I do then the Holy Spirit
[1:14:48] comes upon the same word of God

[1:15:25] can have his life and how do I do it by
[1:15:27] taking his word eat the book he's seen
[1:15:30] put his seed in there by faith and
[1:15:32] believe it and then it produces exactly
