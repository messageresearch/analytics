Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we are totally surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ we've given ourselves away [Music] therefore we do not find ourselves in a worldly celebration to us this is means more than anything else to Worship the Lord our God amen hallelujah amen so I'd like to greet every one of you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we'll turn to our scripture this morning or this evening Hallelujah let's turn to Revelation 21 and verse 5. we'll speak a little New Year's Eve message amen God likes to do new things amen the world wants to continue in the same old traditions but God surprises them by doing new things amen so Revelation 21 verse 5 says and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new amen if we go into Isaiah 43 and verse 19 God is going to do new things but the new things are not for no reason it's for a specific people so Isaiah 43 and verse 19 says behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall you not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness yes you know you get lost in wilderness but God is saying I'm Gonna Make A Way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert that's unheard of the Beast of the field shall honor me and the dragons and the owls because I have given Waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert why is he doing this here's the reason to give drink to my people My Chosen these people have I formed for myself eight billion people on the Earth but this people I have formed for myself they shall show forth my praise amen you may be seated may the Lord of blessings to the reading of his word amen amen good to see everyone in the house of the Lord amen everybody feeling good amen amen amen so we find ourselves amen at the end of another here amen for some it may have been good some it may have been bad some God is well pleased with us some God is highly disappointed with us some have given our best excuses to the Lord in the past year why we couldn't serve him some have gotten closer to the Lord we can use this time as a time of reflection to say Lord however I've been serving you have I gotten more closer to you about backslidden we can gauge that right have I gotten closer to the Lord or have I backslidden am I walking out to my own ways why am I saying Lord I'm following up to your ways so we drawing closer to thee end of another cycle of the Earth's revolution around the Sun and it's about to start another you all know he takes the earth 365 days five hours 59 minutes and 16 seconds which is a one year to revolve around the Sun amen so we find even our modern calendar that we use today reminds us that it has been 2023 years since our Lord Jesus Christ was born into this world to redeem and save Mankind from their sin it serves as a reminder we're going into 2023 what does that first tell us our lord Jesus came two thousand years ago now people think that God doesn't work by times or by season but God does he said he set up the Sun and the Moon God has got a specific time and a season he knows exactly when he's coming he knew the first time of his first coming he knows the time of his second coming and Jesus said no man know it no man knoweth he says but the father knoweth the father knoweth all things so who knows if this be the year where the Lord will close up a dispensation we don't know amen we must take note that it is another year closer to the end of the period that the Holy Ghost has been working amongst the Gentiles he's been working since the day of Pentecost but it's it's about time now when the Holy Ghost dispensation amongst the Gentiles will be finished amen and I wonder if that we're coming to the end of the dispensation and some have not got the inheritance amen so we'll send our thoughts or some things on those things because we're going to look at Joshua and Joshua is a type of parallels Ephesians and we know Joshua is trying to place them in a physical land and yes spiritually we are trying to be placed in a land right amen so so I'd like to greet every one of you once again I trusted everybody as well before I want to get started amen I just want to invite uh brother Joshua and brother Sunny to greet the church for five minutes each I'm sure they got something to encourage you amen I don't know why sister Elaine is smiling she thinks that's impossible but With God all things are possible amen amen so With God all things are possible so amen I appreciate the ministry appreciate the brothers that stand by appreciate amen the song leaders amen thank you brother Jacobs for leading the songs but amen they are the ones that fool around the coming of the minister and if they don't set the right atmosphere it's harder for the minister to preach to the people so even the song leading is a gift amen they carry an anointing even the musicians amen I'd like to say thank you for your service to the Lord I know my words and my thanks may not mean much because you are really offering it to the Lord but as the past of the church I want to extend my appreciation to you amen even the other helps for the Jaden amen all the other brothers that help out in the church amen whatever offers you hold in the church like to thank Brother Sam to the Tyler was always here at the church and try to cleaning up and doing the stuff behind the scenes things that we don't see amen but the same is always concerned you know checking up on things checking up if I've got water checking up on all these small things those are Ministries those are gifts amen those are helps to the church and we appreciate every one of them then we don't want to forget our singers amen whatever amen they're trying to do something for the Lord and they're trying to give their best to the Lord but I believe we can step it up we can go higher amen we can Excel but like David would would tell the people play skillfully before the Lord amen sing joyfully sing wonderfully amen We Can Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord so amen we don't want to waste too much of time uh don't call Brother Joshua first amen and then we'll call Brother the son amen yes amen I greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and that we thank the Lord for it seeing as food is here amen and I think you heard me make mention of the one statement earlier this year that when we first came in the message and we looked at the amount of messages that were there and we thought when what happened when we come to the end of that message only to find out when you receive the Holy Ghost you realize that under the leadership of the holy spirit that this is an inexhaustible Fountain of Life Hallelujah and as we've seen the progression in the world we know there's been a transition in the ministry and we appreciate how the Lord has seen us through amen and we've seen the progression in the world because it's reaching a climax now and we're coming to the close to the end of the Gentile dispensation and as the prophet said as it gets closer all these things will be revealed Hallelujah so all these Mysteries have been made more clearer to us and how is it Behavior God gives always find the amazing man God has placed the FireFold Ministry they play certain opposite His Place Ministries and God's uses vessels that he has chosen before the foundations of the Earth they're very aware that the prophet has spoken this very word that was stored up for jewishism is now using his gifts to bring it out and make it clear to you to make it make you to understand it in the day that you are living it so as you're seeing the world being preached it makes it makes sense in the day that you are living and you began to want you began to understand your part and Play Your Part in academics and realize your heart in the mystery amen so it's no longer a mystery when you are playing your part amen now it's a manifestation yes of that word amen and that's where we are right now and as we sing ourselves approaching the new year we know that we we have learned we don't turn you leave but we want to get ourselves more consecrated to God yes we don't know what the new rules but we know as long as he's holding us in his hands yes and as long as we stay fortified under his word then we know that we are in safety ground amen so I greet you all in the lovely name of Jesus Christ we thank God for each one of you for every family I believe there's a progression in each home amen and that's what we want we don't want a progression just in the church we want a progression to every believer because each one of us make the body of Christ amen every one of us that they put to play and every one of us make the body of Christ make up the body of Christ to continue to pray for the ministry pray for our pastor that God will give him more revelation of the world and then we can be fulfilled with that amen God is placed the gift here we need to respect the gift and appreciate the gift is given us and also the faithful Ministry that will come that will come and preach it come and preach to us from time to time we must appreciate the gifts that God sends us and pull from the gift and God will take us as we're going along the spiritual journey now we believe that there's much land to possess amen don't let the uncircumcised go and claim things just by saying things and claiming things this all these things belong to us amen this entire Earth now it's a scientific civilization yes but this Earth is going to be renovated It All Belongs to us we have rightful claims over it amen but it's not a foot darling phrase right now but God is going to make it a good wedding place just like are you dealing with man through Redemption justification by water blood and the whole baptism of the Holy Ghost just like that he's been dealing with the Earth through water so Noah from the days of Noah the blood of Jesus upon the Earth and now we know what's going to happen upon the Earth with fire amen this world will be renovated amen and become a foot Dwelling Place amen God needs to bless you as you enter the New Year our desire is to have a closer walk with him to be more consecrated and more closer to him yes and because what we want is for him to reveal more of his word to us amen amen God bless you thank you hmm praise the Lord amen praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God getting old theater starting to hold back he's still Grace amen creature in the lovely name of Jesus Christ evening sometime I would like to say I'm happy but sometimes we can be disappointed this place should be full tonight but when we look around people chose to still stay at home people chose to stay at home and rather be in the presence of the Lord but then during the course of the year you want to call to the eldest and call to the church you want to call a preacher because you're having problems problems can never be solved at all the only place it can be solved in the house of God Amen because God is anointing people God is Anointed his servants to come and do that work amen you cannot stay here and stay at home and do it you know we're going into the New Year we're not fighting against flesh and blood yes invading against principalities wickedness and high places the prophet said 200 000 demons are released on the face of the Earth and we are not safe anyway unless we allow ourselves to have a head built around us yes and that only thing can be done is by God God is Grace when you sufficiently just now he said spoke about excuses you know excuses are something that is very very dangerous very dangerous see the Bible you see everything that if an answer you require an answer you will get it in the Bible nothing that you cannot get if you're looking for something everything if you're looking for love you'll get it in the Bible if you're looking for hate you'll get it in the Bible if you're looking for a fight you'll get it in the Bible excuses are very dangerous if he did not forgave a parable about those men that were invited to the Sabbath he said they were invited for supper but when they went to call them what happened one said I married a wife I need to have some time so today some people have married their wife and they had some time at home then the other one he said he bought 10 euros of milk oxen and you need to go and check it out first time in my life I want to see somebody doing business and doing it in the night yeah doing that on now and check the option for plowing the night oh he's gonna plow in the late night time no you can't do that then I got a guy bought a land he didn't want to go chicken up in the night you see now when you make excuses they don't sound right then you will find another excuse for that excuse and then you will continue and it will be a lie and one lie about another level I don't want to start preaching tonight because we have somebody that the Lord has chosen to preach but this is how we like to end our this is this is a year that has gone through we are going through some hard times we have gone through the Peaks and The Valleys in our rights we have gone through the storms we've gone through the winds and you know the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus is the one that can calm the storms amen he made us like eagles so we can Fly Above the storms so there is no storm that can come for you and if you've got the Hedge around you tell them to you nothing he's the captain of our ship he can take us through those waves through the tsunamis in our lives we have many of them I want to remind you the next year is not going to be a easy year for us if you don't have the Lord it's not going to be easy it's going to be very very difficult because if you look around us the scriptures have been fulfilled every moment in time if you look from scriptures are being fulfilled you never hear of Rivers Drive you will never hear of floods like this and the rivers are drying in spite of the flags so you can see these demons are alive and they're making havoc on Earth so tonight as we move on to the new year let us let us hear tonight make a covenant to God we will pray for the backsliders we will pray for the backsliders so they will tell back to the cold time is attacked we haven't got much time yeah 50 years ago the prophet said he was coming 50 years down the line we still see people are still dirty lazy it is time that we now wake up it is time that we realize time is short time is a Time he says when you see these things begin to happen he said lift up your head for your Redemption throughout night and if our Redemption is coming near what we are waiting for amen we are waiting for our body change amen he said eyes have not the lies have not seen years have not been neither it is entered into the heart of man what God is prepared for us and you can still be you know like let's see this you can still be not concerned be concerned about everything amen everything be concernable yes God Will Make A Way we don't serve a dead God yes amen God's life internally oh God not sleeping yeah yeah is that right and with the serving a god that is living there is nothing that is impossible for us amen the new years we can go to it all we're going to know that he is going to come and to receive us and then be going over to the other side I pray tonight that we will turn around from all those Wasted Years we have wasted many years I regret the days that beauties but we are wasted many years let us turn around and look to God Amen I also want to thank the church tonight for praying so today I can stand here I never thought I'm going to stand here I keep telling you that your prayer has been the one that brought me back as I promised the Lord that I will do his work if you bring me through and he has brought me through I feel stronger but he did also my family thank you all he stood by me in a very closely very bad times I've seen two or three years now and I've been in God has given me a little bit more time amen and maybe I can spread the gospel some things maybe I haven't finished the work pray that the Lord will allow me to finish the world and I pray tonight that God will give you the grace give you strength tonight to continue until he comes it's not going to be long soon we'll be going home when the battle is over amen thank you Brothers for those words of encouragement amen already blessed you sharing that amen hearing these brothers encourage us amen our brother the submission is a man of few words but he's been serving as the Deacon of the church he's been doing a tremendous job at that amen so we're just going to ask him to come forward and greet the church as well and I'm sure he's not going to keep uh he probably will under use his five minutes but brother submission we want to appreciate you amen you come forward let's keep my hand amen [Applause] please [Music] show me the name of 1070s Christ amen I believe it's uh everybody's Grace that you've seen another year yeah [Music] and I believe that like a brother said we need to pray for our families they're very stepped away and those are excellent so that they may come back into the fourth yeah especially my Allah already for me but I believe the praise of the sins amen believe she was gonna come but he prayed the Lord will touch her amen so we move along into our service and uh amen after the preaching of the word will observe communion and feed washing Hallelujah these are the ordinances given to the church amen everybody feeling good amen turn to your neighbor and say God bless you amen if they are sleeping tell them wake up I know many of us around this time we're already in bed so today is an unusual day amen amen amen but if we were at home or something else and there was no church I don't know what we'll be doing I remember that one year during the lockdown we were like completely lost we didn't know what to do amen but we thank the Lord that we can be found in the presence of the Lord this evening amen so let's start out in Joshua chapter 1 verse 6 and here the Lord is commissioning Joshua so I want you to follow the sequence of events hear the Lord is speaking to Joshua the new leader remember our focus is something new behold I will do new things we're entering a new year amen so God is now speaking to the new leader and in 1 6 he tells him be strong and have a good courage amen For unto this people shall not divide for an inheritance the land that every one of us has to have a portion of the Holy Ghost Joshua is here to divide the land and bring you into your inheritance he says unto those people shall that divide for inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them so God is bound by his word what he promised Abraham so long ago he is still making sure his word is coming to pass situations may have changed Seasons may have changed man may have changed but God still remained true to his word amen he says only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with us however thou goest but actually I'm going to tell you your natural blessings are tied to your spiritual relationship with the Lord here's the Lord laying it out to Joshua you keep the law You observe the message and everything the prophet laid out in the message and you shall be prosperous he says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth oh did you get it the book mustn't be in your hand the book mustn't be on the Shelf if the book is on your mouth it means you must be speaking about it [Music] let me say these people have formed for myself that they may show forth my praise what is praise being able to speak he's saying the book of the Lord shall not depart out of their mouth you can't get them to shut up amen they got a word they're going to speak but Thou shalt meditate day in day and night that thou man is to observe to do according to all that is written therein then thou shall make thy way prosperous have you heard some of the advice being given I am giving you advice how to approach the New Year this evening approach it with observing what the Bible says change your life around [Music] amen don't follow your own understanding in the way you want to do things right you say but I'm successful let's read and then thou shall have good success but all success is not good success there is good success and there is bad success you say what about the way of the ungodly and The Sinner and the successful what about the one who serves other gods they are successful and they achieve they have good jobs their wealth it depends what you determine and what you call successful early achievements worldly accomplishments and education is not something to be impressed or to be post about those are means to an end one of the most successful young men recorded in the Bible most successful you couldn't find the most successful man than this he was young and he was successful the Bible calls him the Rich Young Ruler testified to this when he came to the end of his successful achievements he came to the most successful man he didn't go to the rabbis he was searching for something and you know when you are successful you don't want to go and speak to somebody who is less successful than you so he comes to the greatest to the Fountain of all success our Lord Jesus Christ and he asked Jesus what good thing can I do that I may have eternal life amen he and you were successfully we are driving your point here now the same Lord Jesus who told him to sell all you have give it to the poor take up your cross and come and follow me Christ is still calling you to follow him are you willing to follow him amen some have followed Jesus but along the way a Day's Journey or two days journey when Jesus turned to look back you're not there you've gone and doing your own things but follow Jesus amen the same Jesus in Matthew 6 33 gives us the key to the kingdom of God the key to success he says seek him first the kingdom of God this is the same one speaking to Joshua telling him observe the Commandments of God Amen now he's in human flesh and he is telling you seek ye first the kingdom of God some of you are the same man right now amen amen I don't know what you are thinking about right now but you get involved in the service you involve yourself in this spiritual atmosphere amen hallelujah amen I don't care if you're a male I don't care if you're a female I don't care if you're young I don't care if you're old you are to open up your mouth and amen the word of God Amen Miss amen that's one good thing we want to do new in the new year a new Hallelujah and you praise the Lord amen how many of you want to do something new in the New Year Shock Me amen how many of you know you know sometimes you may not even want to say Amen but you can just raise your hand Hallelujah oh we gotta shake things up amen hallelujah you know why the flesh is weak the spirit man within you is willing but the flesh is weak amen amen hallelujah he says then all these things shall be added unto you he will add it God will add it to you good success comes from having a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ we are defining good success being born again of water and of spirit it comes with having a new birth having the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's the definition of true success he that believeth on him shall not perish but have everlasting life a periods of people are living many meaningless lives billions of people are wasting the time on the Earth because they are living without the Holy Ghost they will live out their time on Earth and go to the Grave with no promise of a resurrection it's ruthless meaningless lives but there is a group of people that have a promise of an inheritance amen are you part of that group a many many men Hallelujah if you're part of the group amen then you ought to get involved right now oh I think it's it's sleeping time amen some of you think I'm telling you a bedtime story some of you are thinking hey I I do this every night I put the prophet's message on to fall asleep I try every you know if I watch a movie I can that thing takes two hours yeah I'm awake two hours but I put the prophet's message hey it was like a charm 30 seconds I'm out where your treasure is where's your treasure amen hallelujah I'm trying to keep it positive about I'm trying to keep it good this evening amen but the spirit of the Lord wants to root out some things yeah amen we cannot continue the same old way and expect better results one day what is what they say is the definition of insanity doing the same things the same old way and expecting a different result amen amen Hallelujah now we have the promise of an inheritance let's let's pick up uh Ephesians 1 13. let's look at what our inheritance is you know you also trusted after you heard the word of Truth the gospel of your salvation you know also after you believed you were sealed with that Holy Ghost of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the day of redemption of the purchased position amen we are almost there now we're almost at the end amen wake up amen it's time to master up all your strength I'm talking about spiritual muscles spiritual strength amen spiritual Faith Amen to rise up in the things of God Amen amen and run with all that we have to finish the race strong amen oh Hallelujah it says amen this kind of people who have the promise of an inheritance in fact we cannot live without the Holy Ghost anointing amen we are so determined that we would rather die than live a day without the Holy Ghost anointing we would rather die than live live without being led by the angel of God Amen amen can I get some people who will back me up with that statement amen we refuse to go forward without the leadership of the holy spirit amen we refuse to go forward when man made ideas and creeds amen God is raising up a generation that will keep the message pure that will preaches in its entirety amen whether it make sense to us or not we will preach it amen and stay with what the prophet said thank you amen amen we are like that who sing that song I can't even walk without you holding my hand amen we cannot live without the Holy Ghost in fact Ephesians paralyze Joshua and Joshua is the type of the end time leader trying to empower the people and place them in the land of the inheritance and in the spiritual land I find evidence the Holy Ghost amen is our inheritance and the end time leader through the prophet and the fivefold he's trying to place us and position Us in the Holy Ghost now everyone must be placed in the Holy Ghost I want to go from down here and ask every one of you do you have the Holy Ghost most important question you will ever be asked in all your life because if you do not have the Holy Ghost there is no Rapture for you there's no Resurrection for you I want you to live your best life in 2023 but there's a way of good success of living it I'm not focusing now on Gross Darkness because gross Darkness will always be there right it's Bible prophecy but I'm talking about where the light is shining because I Rise and Shine amen so my life has come amen there is no family in where the light is amen amen in Goshen amen they are feasting and they are in abundance they have the blessings of the Holy Ghost yes we have the secret to living a successful and prosperous life in 2023 amen amen and we are giving you that secret right now before be filled be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen and if you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost how many of you want a double portion anointing amen amen amen hallelujah everyone must be placed in the Holy Ghost now Joshua 1 15 is very interesting let's follow this Joshua 1 15. Joshua now the Lord finished speak to Joshua now Joshua is speaking to the people and instructing the people and listen to what Joshua tells him he says until the Lord had given your brother's rest as he has given you and they also possess the land which the Lord your God giveth them then shall you return unto the land of your possession and enjoy it if it went over your head I'm going to break it down for you Joshua is telling the people some of them need help right to get to the land of the inheritance and you don't go to your inheritance don't settle down in your land until they have settled down in their land amen amen until you position them if that isn't a type of the faithful Ministries laboring amen Amen to position the people amen amen amen 14 chapters later the scene changes foreign amen listen now follow there he says You must return to the land of your inheritance after they are settled and enjoy it now for those of you who are too spiritual who think that we should not enjoy things in this life what is the old Book of Joshua all about placing them in a physical land to enjoy the physical blessings of the land as long as you are still here on the Earth this is your home and God will bless you here on the Earth amen now let's turn to Joshua 14. so while he's turning to Joshua 14 there the people answer Joshua he instructs them don't settle in your land don't settle and get comfortable in your own in your inheritance through your brothers are settled but there comes a man in Joshua 14. he spent up to these people they're fighting for 40 years and some people have not gone into the land of the inheritance this man was a gallon man everybody paying attention I'm gonna wake you up every five minutes because I know it's late amen everybody raise their hand Give the Lord a wave praise the Lord a many many men listen now here's a man who got tired of waiting people don't want to be placed in their narratives brother Sonny brother Joshua how long must we labor to place the people in the land of the inheritance listen carefully now there's a man by the name of Caleb the Bible says he had a different Spirit upon him thank you and 14 chapters the Bible says 40 years had passed and some people are still not positionally placed in their land the land was given to them didn't we just read the Judgment marked out the inheritance they had to go and take it 40 years later they still don't have the land this man grows tired I want to enjoy my inheritance also let's pick it up in 15 there thank you oh 1410 sorry and now behold the Lord now he's he's really talking to them now I'm just picking it up from this point he says the Lord attacked me alive like brother Sonny just told you the Lord had kept him alive he's 40 and five years ever since the Lord speak this word out to Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now Lord I am this day four score and five years old and yet times strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me he said he was 45 now I'm 85. as my strength was there and even so is my strength now for walk both to go out and to come in now therefore give me my Mountain amen amen if these people don't want to be placed in the inheritance I want my inheritance amen I need to break this down because some will not get it is the closing of his dispensation he realizes it's coming to an end because Caleb is the type of the Bride amen amen oh do you get it right do you know who's speaking right now amen amen Caleb knows it's the end of the Gentile dispensation Caleb was the type of the bright noise the ending of his life and he says you know what I've tried enough to settle the people but now comes my time when must I settle in my inhabitants but give me my mountain amen we have the Lord speaking that day thou let us how in that day that the animals were and the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said and Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of jephiana Ebron for an inheritance and you know what this man he just made a post he said give me the Land of the Giants and that's what we are doing right now I tell you we're taking on the greatest task amen the greatest test the land is full of giants but God is raising up a cab in this hour we say give me that inheritance you say Define revelation 10 give me that inheritance I am able to handle it amen you mean you can handle Revelation 10.
