[3:56] but God knows what we need amen and he's
[4:00] given us the greatest gift to empower Us
[4:03] in this hour amen so we'll also read
[4:07] another scripture

[4:11] let's read Romans chapter 14 and verse
[4:14] 17.
[4:16] [Music]
[4:19] amen Romans chapter 14 and verse 17 he
[4:23] says for the kingdom of God is Not meat

[4:47] amen
[4:49] so we'll speak this morning on the
[4:51] transforming power of the Holy Ghost
[4:53] amen amen
[4:56] so look at what this gives just by the
[4:58] title alone God giving us a gift but the
[5:01] gift is sent to transform us amen
[5:04] amen the gift is not to settle Us in
[5:07] this life the gift is sent to transform
[5:10] us amen you're the property saying God
[5:13] is going to have a church I don't care
[5:15] how many dark
[5:17] ages maybe seven Church ages are
[5:19] prophesied to come but he's going to
[5:22] have a church without spot or wrinkle
[5:25] you know there's a verse in the Bible
[5:26] that says there's gonna come a day A
[5:28] Dark Day
[5:29] a gloomy day that's prophecy
[5:33] amen
[5:35] everybody following me
[5:37] We Can't Stop prophecy
[5:40] the Bible says there's going to be a
[5:41] dark day a gloomy day right there's
[5:43] going to be a day where there's famine
[5:45] for the word of God we are living in
[5:47] that day amen we can't stop that
[5:49] prophecy but the prophecy continues he
[5:53] says but at evening time there shall be
[5:55] light amen amen hallelujah he says go
[5:58] start the shall cover the whole world
[6:01] amen but he says arise and shine there's
[6:05] another part of the prophecy
[6:07] and you and I are a part of the prophecy
[6:11] amen amen if if we continue in the way
[6:14] of the way of the world we will continue
[6:16] in a dark and gloomy way but we have got
[6:19] to make the word of God live and allow
[6:21] the word of God to transform us
[6:24] amen amen now God is transforming you
[6:26] from what you were
[6:28] amen maybe you're a daughter or son or
[6:30] whatever it is from a lovely family but
[6:33] God is placing you into his kingdom
[6:36] amen
[6:37] there's a difference between a normal
[6:39] human being and there's a difference
[6:41] between walking in the kingdom of God
[6:44] the one that's walking in the kingdom of
[6:46] God has been born again
[6:48] you can't compare yourself with a
[6:50] natural man who is not born again
[6:52] there are two different species
[6:57] people talk about discrimination there's
[7:00] discrimination right there people that
[7:03] are born in the kingdom of God are
[7:04] Heavenly amen amen and then there's the
[7:07] natural man walking according to the
[7:09] things of this world right two different
[7:11] beings
[7:13] one's heart has been turned Heavenly one
[7:15] is walking naturally amen so God is
[7:19] transforming you look where he brought
[7:21] you from
[7:22] he took you out of your family
[7:24] amen look at the things you have
[7:26] forsaken for the cause of the Gospel
[7:29] God what is he doing he's transforming
[7:32] you by the renewing of your mind
[7:35] and you don't even know except because
[7:37] sometimes In the Flesh you know we get
[7:39] sometimes
[7:42] all comfortable in the flesh and we
[7:44] think no maybe I can do this but the
[7:46] spirit of God doesn't allow you to do it
[7:48] right the spirit of God is there to keep
[7:50] you in line he's there to call you to
[7:53] prayer he's there to call you Amen to
[7:56] read the word he's there to call you to
[7:58] a time of fasting what is doing that the
[8:01] spirit of the Holy Ghost
[8:05] amen
[8:06] now what is Satan's plan
[8:09] Satan's plan is to make you conform to
[8:11] the world
[8:13] Satan's plan is to deform you right
[8:16] right the seed that is within you he
[8:17] wants to deform that sin
[8:20] amen is a deformer is a perverter and
[8:24] he's a corruptor of the Original Seed
[8:26] amen he deformed and corrupted the sea
[8:29] that was in Eden
[8:31] he caused the angels in heaven to fall
[8:34] and he's looking now to you in Satan's
[8:37] Heathen he wants to corrupt the seed
[8:39] word that's in you
[8:43] Amen in Isaiah 14 and verse 12 it says
[8:46] how have I fallen from heaven or Lucifer
[8:48] son of the morning
[8:51] how are they cut down to the ground
[8:53] which tips weaken the Nations
[8:58] Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[9:01] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[9:04] also in the mouth of the congregation in
[9:06] the sides of the Lord that day is you
[9:09] Mount Zion holy Jerusalem is you
[9:12] Satan wants to establish his throne in
[9:15] your heart
[9:16] the place that God has established his
[9:19] throne
[9:22] Satan is saying I will sit upon the
[9:24] Mount of the congregation in the sides
[9:27] of the north I will Ascend above the
[9:29] clouds either the clouds I will be like
[9:31] the most high what is he doing Christ
[9:34] the most high has put his holy spirit in
[9:37] you
[9:39] but Satan wants to put his Spirit In You
[9:42] he wants to help dominion over you
[9:45] he wants to set up rulership and Kingdom
[9:48] Life In You
[9:49] [Music]
[9:52] he wants to take the place of God in our
[9:54] lives
[9:56] [Music]
[9:58] now what are we doing with God's gift
[10:02] the Holy Spirit
[10:03] what are we doing with God's Gift in our
[10:06] life
[10:08] amen
[10:10] now Satan wants to distort the vision
[10:12] that God has for your life
[10:15] he did it in heaven right
[10:17] he went and he
[10:19] made the angels of heaven conform to his
[10:22] ideal
[10:23] if he made angels fall
[10:27] this guy is a shyster name
[10:30] if he deceived angels
[10:35] then he was kicked out of heaven he goes
[10:37] into Eden
[10:39] and the highest clear form of creation
[10:41] he starts to deceive Eve
[10:44] amen and he distorted the word in Eve he
[10:48] corrupted the seed in Eve
[10:50] and he got done to fall away from the
[10:52] world
[10:54] we are living in another time now where
[10:57] the world has been re-established church
[10:59] we are not at the starting phase this is
[11:02] not the Ephesian Church age amen we are
[11:05] at the end of the latest in church age
[11:07] and at the end of the Legacy in church
[11:09] age God has sent for the prophet of the
[11:11] age
[11:11] to restore the true word back to the
[11:14] people
[11:15] amen we cannot start back and rebuild
[11:19] we are not a justification we are not in
[11:22] Wesley's message we are not at the
[11:24] outpouring of the gift set uh amen the
[11:26] Jews are straight and the Pentecostal
[11:27] Revival
[11:29] amen we've got to understand where we
[11:32] are yes
[11:34] we are the finishing Amen in fact we can
[11:37] see the Finishing Line and we will run
[11:40] with all we have
[11:42] amen Satan wants to distort your vision
[11:45] amen put up the first quote in the power
[11:46] of transformation he says now you see
[11:49] like in your group here this morning you
[11:51] got a program you got a vision
[11:54] the past there's a vision amen The
[11:56] Minister's application amen but look
[11:59] watch for the corrupture
[12:02] amen you'll be Sly as slick as he can be
[12:05] you see but keep your vision amen keep
[12:09] your focus in 2023 keep your focus amen
[12:14] it's just February and some of us have
[12:17] already lost our Focus
[12:19] some of us have already lost our vision
[12:22] some of us have already lost our passion
[12:25] amen amen all the pledges we make to God
[12:27] in January we have forgotten about it
[12:30] because the cares of the life the
[12:32] corrupters come in to distort our vision
[12:36] amen the spirit of God is here this
[12:38] morning to tell you hold true to the
[12:40] vision amen stay the cause amen
[12:43] amen what is he doing amen he says oh
[12:47] keep holding to that
[12:49] keep holding to the vision right
[12:52] you'll say oh but I can't see any
[12:53] progress
[12:55] I can't see any results
[12:57] you know somebody who's got a body like
[13:00] me flat no muscle
[13:04] if I spend time training
[13:07] if I go to the gym
[13:09] and I start lifting up some weights I
[13:13] start changing my diet
[13:15] do you know the next day you're not
[13:17] going to see the results even though I
[13:19] start walking like this everywhere you
[13:21] see these guys one day they go to gym
[13:23] and they start walking like this
[13:26] hey
[13:28] but what happens if you are consistent
[13:31] in it
[13:32] if you go every day
[13:34] and you train
[13:36] and you change your diet you commit
[13:38] yourself
[13:39] suddenly you start to see a
[13:42] transformation
[13:43] start to see those muscle
[13:45] amen you start to see your body start to
[13:48] turn
[13:50] so it's a gradual thing that's why every
[13:53] day we've got to read the word of God
[13:55] and pray amen
[13:56] amen amen it's only one sort of thing
[14:01] it's a daily walk with the Lord
[14:04] Satan wants you to start the vision of
[14:06] God for your life
[14:08] and you know the prophet will tell us
[14:09] that sometimes it got so cold where they
[14:12] were and in the morning his eyes were
[14:14] shut because of the cold
[14:16] tell me if you read that
[14:18] and he says his mother would bring
[14:20] something
[14:22] and put it on the eye
[14:24] now we've got ourselves
[14:27] the word of God
[14:29] maybe every morning Satan wants to put
[14:31] it on our eye make it cold but
[14:35] beat the word
[14:37] take the ice job every morning
[14:39] and say Lord I do not know what awaits
[14:42] me during the course of this day because
[14:43] none of us do know
[14:45] I don't know what Temptation May await
[14:48] me but leave me not into temptation amen
[14:50] but Deliver Me From Evil yes
[14:54] read the word of God to encourage you
[14:56] and inspire you for the day
[14:58] it'll strengthen you amen
[15:02] not only that but being in the kingdom
[15:04] of God
[15:05] we are weapons at our disposal
[15:08] and we must use it in order to protect
[15:11] the world that's in our hearts
[15:15] Amen in order to protect our growth and
[15:18] our future
[15:19] we've got to make wise Investments
[15:22] we've got to protect what's ours
[15:26] Amen in the natural don't you get these
[15:28] financial advisors telling you protect
[15:30] your future protect your family's future
[15:33] invest wisely
[15:36] amen where are they getting the
[15:37] spiritual concept they're getting it
[15:39] from the word of God
[15:42] amen everything that man does on the
[15:45] earth they have taken from the word of
[15:47] God where do you get motivational
[15:49] speakers from they have copied the
[15:51] preaching of the word because it's only
[15:54] the word of God can motivate us and
[15:55] Inspire us
[15:57] yes amen amen where do you get
[16:00] psychologists and counselors from
[16:02] marriage counselors
[16:04] from the Christian faith the first
[16:06] counselors were pastors
[16:08] dealing with marriage problems with
[16:10] mental problems all of these problems
[16:12] they took it and they made careers out
[16:15] of it
[16:16] amen
[16:18] Hallelujah
[16:23] why did they get automated Gates
[16:25] from the Bible
[16:28] when they dropped them in prison
[16:31] and the angel of God came into prison
[16:33] and he opened up the gates automatically
[16:36] somebody admission for them the company
[16:39] from the word of God
[16:41] amen
[16:43] Hallelujah
[16:45] now we must not allow unbelief to lay in
[16:48] our hearts we must allow the Holy Spirit
[16:51] to transform us into His Image
[16:53] completely
[16:55] but I'm saying completely that word at
[16:58] the end is there for a reason because
[17:00] some of us are starting to allow the
[17:02] image to form
[17:03] and then we are stopping
[17:05] the image is not complete yet
[17:09] amen the image is a perfect image and
[17:13] you can reach perfection in Christ
[17:16] you say even in the flesh I can reach
[17:18] Perfection yes you can
[17:21] Satan wants to make you think that you
[17:23] will not attain perfection in his life
[17:27] but our Perfection is not resting Upon
[17:30] Our Own abilities
[17:31] our Perfection is in Christ
[17:34] amen
[17:36] amen the kingdom of God is righteousness
[17:39] didn't we just read that
[17:40] kingdom of God is righteousness peace
[17:43] and joy in the Holy Ghost what is
[17:46] righteousness
[17:47] to be in right standing with God Amen
[17:51] who makes us in right standing because
[17:52] our righteousness is like filthy rags it
[17:55] is the blood of Jesus that covers us
[17:57] from our sins
[17:59] you see the moment we go and we tell
[18:00] ourselves hey I'm a sinner and and all
[18:03] of us have sinned that we all have
[18:04] thoughts and failures we are nullifying
[18:06] the blood of Jesus
[18:08] because when Jesus looks at us he looks
[18:11] at us through the blood and he's asking
[18:12] what sin are you talking about
[18:14] [Music]
[18:17] that is why when we go to the father
[18:18] what do we say father I come to you
[18:20] through the blood of your precious son
[18:23] we have a representation
[18:26] [Music]
[18:27] and the blood of Jesus Christ covers Us
[18:30] from all of our sins
[18:33] amen hallelujah so the kingdom of God is
[18:36] righteousness Satan will come and
[18:38] Whisper you're a failure
[18:40] you'd say you point to your faults and
[18:42] your failures and you know how he does
[18:44] that sometimes he'll make your husband
[18:46] and wife point it out he'll make your
[18:48] children point it out or you'll point it
[18:50] out in the children
[18:55] amen
[18:58] don't let Satan start to whisper to you
[19:00] and don't you speak life into a
[19:03] situation and make it worse
[19:05] amen
[19:07] don't go and aggravate a situation
[19:09] rather encourage a situation to get out
[19:12] of the situation amen amen
[19:16] if you see the husband the wife the son
[19:18] the daughter not conforming rather call
[19:20] them back to the word of God
[19:23] amen
[19:26] Hallelujah instead of fighting and
[19:29] fasting why don't you say let's pray
[19:32] you see the problem is that we don't
[19:35] want to surrender completely to the work
[19:36] of the holy spirit so we'd rather see
[19:39] our husband and our wives and our sons
[19:40] and daughters just carry on living in
[19:43] your life at home because we do not want
[19:45] to contribute fully ourselves
[19:48] that is why you don't call your husband
[19:49] out
[19:51] and tell him but we're supposed to be
[19:52] Christians let's pray over the situation
[19:55] why are we getting water why are we
[19:57] getting faster you can't make ends meet
[19:59] you're looking amen you don't know where
[20:00] you're going to get your legs loaf of
[20:02] bread from why don't you pray amen say
[20:05] Lord you said Lord you own a cattle on a
[20:07] thousand years you said if I seek your
[20:09] kingdom first Lord all of these things
[20:11] will be added unto me
[20:15] yeah
[20:17] now the neighbor is fighting with you
[20:19] you're telling them wait till my husband
[20:21] get home
[20:25] he's going to sort you out
[20:28] but now when the husband gets home the
[20:30] solution should be let's pray about it
[20:33] amen we can change the atmospheres
[20:37] and maybe in the past we haven't handled
[20:39] things correctly but the spirit of God
[20:41] is here to teach us
[20:43] the spirit of God is here to tell us
[20:45] amen how to act
[20:47] but we've got to be sensitive to the
[20:49] spirit's voice
[20:50] amen let's be sensitive to the spirit's
[20:52] voice this morning
[20:55] amen
[20:57] the reason why people still get caught
[20:59] up in impure and perfect
[21:01] things and fail in the daily walk is
[21:04] because they do not want the Holy Spirit
[21:07] to govern and Rule their lives in fact
[21:09] some some uh people are okay with their
[21:12] husbands not being too spiritual
[21:16] because if they know their husband gets
[21:18] spiritual and born again and filled with
[21:19] the Holy Ghost is gonna sort that old
[21:21] family out
[21:22] right
[21:27] amen you know what I'm saying people
[21:29] don't want the Holy Spirit which is the
[21:31] gift to govern their lives
[21:33] people don't want to surrender you know
[21:36] what the surrender is where every word
[21:39] every thought amen every action is
[21:42] healed to the spirit right
[21:48] hold on to the things of the world
[21:50] because this wants you to surrender
[21:52] completely
[21:53] when we surrender completely to the work
[21:56] of the Holy Spirit then the kingdom
[21:58] becomes righteousness to us amen
[22:00] that's why we can't understand the
[22:02] scripture sometimes that the kingdom of
[22:04] God is righteousness
[22:06] because we dwell in unrighteousness
[22:08] but the kingdom of God is righteousness
[22:13] We Stand righteously inside We Stand
[22:15] perfected in his sight amen and we must
[22:18] fight to maintain this righteous
[22:20] perfection in Christ
[22:22] amen daily we must fight to remain
[22:24] righteous in Christ
[22:29] how by not allowing the world to be
[22:31] taken away
[22:33] it's a daily struggle
[22:35] to overcome the flesh man
[22:37] but we can't let our God down and let
[22:39] the enemy in amen sometimes it's just in
[22:43] a moment like Eve
[22:45] and then she brought destruction upon
[22:47] the entire human race
[22:50] sometimes you can be just once why don't
[22:53] you take a little Puff
[22:54] why don't you have a little drink but
[22:56] remember the Holy Ghost came down to the
[22:58] prophet
[22:59] Don't drink don't smoke don't defile
[23:02] your body in any way for when you grow
[23:04] older I have a work for you to do amen
[23:12] we need to get to a point of desperation
[23:14] in our lives
[23:16] I know this is going over so many
[23:18] people's heads right now
[23:20] because they don't want to submit to the
[23:22] Holy Spirit
[23:23] they're saying preacher preacher sermon
[23:24] we want to go home
[23:26] but if you would hear what the spirit is
[23:28] saying to you this morning
[23:31] we must reach a point of desperation
[23:32] where we refuse to walk in places if his
[23:36] presence is not before us amen
[23:39] amen
[23:41] it is present is not before us behind us
[23:44] beside us and inside us we must refuse
[23:48] to walk in those places
[23:49] refuse to walk in places of negativity
[23:52] [Music]
[23:54] who said he was always associated with
[23:56] that person who's always negative just
[23:58] because they're a family member
[24:01] why don't you remove yourself from them
[24:04] walk in faith
[24:06] Muslim you must always remain around the
[24:08] company or people who are always in the
[24:10] flesh and thinking kindly and Earthly
[24:12] minded yeah to be a follower of Christ
[24:15] you must forsake everything
[24:20] we must have a relationship with God
[24:23] and become a friend of God
[24:26] where we can talk to God Amen if we get
[24:29] to points of desperation in our lives we
[24:31] can talk to God
[24:33] amen
[24:34] like a father-son relationship I'm going
[24:37] to give you an example now Abraham
[24:39] talked with the Lord like he was his
[24:42] friend amen
[24:44] the Bible says he was called the friend
[24:46] of God
[24:48] you know Abraham one time he's having a
[24:50] conversation after the Lord and give
[24:51] calling from the land
[24:53] and he said I'll take you to the new
[24:54] land
[24:56] you'll read there in the Bible he has a
[24:57] conversation with God and he says God
[25:00] you've given me all of these things
[25:03] and yet
[25:04] they add to all of this he's one Elisa
[25:08] Damascus
[25:10] servant in my house
[25:13] in conversation with the Lord
[25:16] but God drops down then
[25:18] and he tells him he shall not be your
[25:21] head
[25:22] I'm going to give you a son
[25:26] I mean if you read that in the Bible
[25:28] he's a friend of God he's talking to the
[25:30] Lord
[25:31] there's another time and the destruction
[25:33] of Sodom and Gomorrah
[25:36] at the descending of the mighty Angel
[25:38] you know the Three Angels come
[25:40] and he says my Lord
[25:42] he starts to have a communication with
[25:44] the Lord and he reaches the point of
[25:46] desperation for the souls that I saw
[25:48] them amen and he starts to bargain with
[25:50] the Lord right
[25:54] now if we are so fearful of the Lord and
[25:56] the Lord don't know our voice
[25:58] if there's no relationship there how can
[26:00] you speak to the Lord in that way
[26:03] there must be relationships
[26:06] amen maybe in the Next Room we can't
[26:08] talk to our fathers
[26:10] fathers can't talk to their sons
[26:12] in the natural
[26:15] but it's not so what our heavenly father
[26:18] or it should not be so without Heavenly
[26:20] Father
[26:21] amen
[26:23] let's learn to Exodus you know how to
[26:25] get to the scriptures
[26:27] Exodus 33 and verse 14 if he doesn't
[26:30] amen you turn in your Bibles I want to
[26:32] show you that Moses also had a
[26:34] relationship with God
[26:41] Exodus 33 and verse 14.
[26:45] he says
[26:46] the Lord is telling Moses now
[26:49] my presence shall go with thee and I
[26:52] will give thee rest
[26:54] you know
[26:55] isn't that a comforting word from the
[26:58] Lord
[27:00] everybody agreed that the comforting
[27:02] word from the Lord everybody got it
[27:04] Exodus 33 and verse 14.
[27:08] for the Joshua don't bring it into 23 I
[27:11] know what you're doing
[27:15] amen
[27:16] my presence shall go with thee and I
[27:19] will give thee rest
[27:22] now all of us would have walked away
[27:23] Lord I heard from you you gave me a
[27:26] promise your presence will go before me
[27:28] and you're going to give me rest but
[27:30] Moses talked back to the Lord and you
[27:34] can't talk back to the Lord this way
[27:35] there's no relationship amen you know
[27:38] what he says he's so desperate he says
[27:40] Lord If thy presence go not with me
[27:42] carry us not his
[27:44] amen
[27:46] thank you
[27:48] the Lord is telling you I'm going to
[27:49] take you out of
[27:51] this place and take you to the land of
[27:53] Israel
[27:54] he's saying Lord if your presence is not
[27:57] dead don't even take us there
[28:00] can we get to that point in our life
[28:02] where we are not prepared to go anywhere
[28:04] unless these prophets go before us
[28:07] amen
[28:10] and he said if that presence go not with
[28:13] me carry us not out ends
[28:18] let's get to 23 then
[28:21] number we're speaking on 23
[28:24] 23 you shall see the unveiling of God
[28:27] 23 brings down his presence
[28:30] 23 if you read go Mark Exodus 33 now
[28:34] from verse 14.
[28:37] and the Lord is going to tell him I'm
[28:38] going to appear
[28:40] he says go stand in the cleft of The
[28:41] Rock
[28:42] I'm gonna appear to you
[28:45] that's your homework to read there I
[28:47] just want to get to 23.
[28:49] because 23 is when you shall see the
[28:52] Supernatural and in 23 the Lord tells
[28:55] him
[28:56] he says
[28:58] I'm gonna have my hand before your eyes
[28:59] right and 23 says I will take away my
[29:02] hand
[29:04] and thou shalt see my backpacks
[29:07] but my face shall not be seen
[29:13] up until that point no man had seen God
[29:17] but here's a man who's so desperate for
[29:19] his presence
[29:20] that the Lord is willing to unveil
[29:22] himself to Moses
[29:27] this is the year God's going to take
[29:31] so that you feel him in a more tangible
[29:33] way
[29:34] you seem in a more tangible way
[29:37] or are you hearing the church you will
[29:40] experience the Lord in your life in a
[29:42] more tangible way he's going to take
[29:45] away the veil from of your eyes
[29:47] amen you shall see the Lord
[29:53] thou shall see my backpacks and my face
[29:56] shall not be seen
[29:58] now I want you to know that promise is
[30:00] to Moses
[30:05] but in this day that was before the Holy
[30:07] Ghost came
[30:08] in this day
[30:11] he says if you love me and you keep my
[30:14] words
[30:17] he said we
[30:19] are going to come and make our boat in
[30:21] you
[30:23] no longer will you need to feel your
[30:26] presence just nearby amen but the
[30:28] presence will be in you
[30:31] aim amen
[30:36] [Music]
[30:39] amen
[30:40] now every one of us are feeding off of
[30:43] something in this life
[30:47] the natural man must feed on food every
[30:49] day
[30:50] in fact they say three hours
[30:52] every three hours right
[30:55] I don't know if I see it every three
[30:56] hours
[30:57] not really but that's what they say
[31:00] you must eat every three hours
[31:03] sometimes we may skip a meal
[31:06] and some of us do intermittent fasting
[31:10] where we that if you don't know what
[31:12] intermittent fasting is you don't eat
[31:13] for a period of time in order to bring
[31:16] the flesh into a shape that you desire
[31:20] amen
[31:24] now as an extra man is eating eat
[31:26] nothing every day
[31:29] the spiritual man must eat of something
[31:32] every day
[31:33] whether you like it or not the spirit
[31:35] man is being fed
[31:40] but what is he being fed
[31:42] that's the question
[31:45] he's been
[31:51] something or someone is feeding our
[31:54] spirit
[31:55] who are we allowing to influence our
[31:57] spirit yes
[32:00] that first
[32:02] in the spirit man was put there by God
[32:05] and will either feed of the word
[32:07] and the things of God so that we thrive
[32:10] in his kingdom
[32:12] where we become like the tree planted by
[32:15] the rivers of waters and people can eat
[32:17] of our fruit
[32:20] amen oh we are feeling of things of the
[32:23] world
[32:25] and the spirit man is suffering
[32:29] he's in bondage
[32:32] has malnutrition
[32:35] and we become like a dried up tree
[32:37] when nobody can eat from our food
[32:40] because we have no fruit
[32:44] and all we have to offer the world is
[32:46] doubt and negativity and our lives
[32:49] become a reproach for the kingdom of God
[32:51] so physically the flesh man picks up his
[32:54] Bible and walks to church
[32:56] but everyone is saying look at that
[32:57] hypocrite
[33:01] amen let's get to the next four amen it
[33:03] says here you'll find that in God adding
[33:05] himself in Simplicity it says depends on
[33:08] what kind of a spirit that's in you what
[33:11] you're feeding on your life is feeding
[33:13] on something
[33:14] don't be a vulture eating the dead
[33:17] crackers of the old the carrying of the
[33:19] Earth
[33:20] feed on the Heavenly things the word of
[33:23] God
[33:24] Jesus said man shall not live by bread
[33:27] alone but by every word that proceeds
[33:30] out of the mouth of God feed upon his
[33:34] word
[33:37] now sometimes you may not always have
[33:40] the ability to read the word
[33:42] but you can listen to good songs when
[33:44] I'm saying good songs that are
[33:46] documental debates
[33:48] amen
[33:50] amen and you can listen to a song that's
[33:53] got the word in it
[33:55] and you can feed your spirit man like
[33:56] that too
[33:58] you can listen to songs you can read the
[34:00] word you can pray
[34:07] the next one he says
[34:08] and I want you to hear this this morning
[34:10] God is here now
[34:13] Christ is in our midst and is willing to
[34:16] give you the Holy Ghost if you're
[34:18] willing to accept it
[34:20] yes what we need to do he says we need
[34:23] to be emptying out for the coming
[34:28] there's got to be a space there there's
[34:30] got to be something a hanger we are
[34:33] trying to persuade and pull this is what
[34:36] we are doing now sometimes as ministers
[34:37] we are guilty of this
[34:39] Church come to church
[34:41] listen what the property is saying we
[34:43] are trying to persuade and pull even
[34:46] some of you come to me why don't you
[34:47] speak to that brother speak to that
[34:49] sister tell them come to church
[34:51] thank you
[34:53] one word to come one week they're not
[34:56] sure the next week
[34:59] you see we are not a denomination
[35:01] [Music]
[35:03] the message is something totally
[35:04] different
[35:05] the message is called a predestinated
[35:08] seeds into the kingdom
[35:10] serving
[35:13] he says we are trying to persuade and
[35:16] pull
[35:17] we ought to be doing that
[35:20] what he say we should not be doing that
[35:24] if a man is hungry for God there's a
[35:27] place empty for him that's all
[35:32] but until there we can smother God into
[35:35] a place
[35:37] you know what he means we're suffocating
[35:39] God into one corner of our heart
[35:44] make email isms and chills and so forth
[35:47] and exchange but it won't work until
[35:49] that man himself wants God you see what
[35:53] I'm saying the man himself must want God
[36:02] so man-made programs are no good get in
[36:05] God's
[36:06] [Music]
[36:09] join Church shake hands formal baptism
[36:11] rituals rosaries nonsense
[36:14] it's a birth
[36:16] and he quotes a scripture blessing a day
[36:18] who would hung up to us for
[36:20] righteousness for they shall be filled
[36:22] you've got to have an empty spot what
[36:25] makes men hunger
[36:29] he says what makes men go out there and
[36:31] do what they do what makes woman God on
[36:33] the street walking in these Immortal
[36:34] clothes what are they trying to do they
[36:37] are trying to satisfy the anger and what
[36:39] do the angle for
[36:41] because they were created to hunger
[36:43] because their hunger how dare any person
[36:46] try to ask that Holy anger that God Made
[36:48] You to hunger for him and try to satisfy
[36:51] to the things of the world you don't
[36:54] have a right to do that right
[36:59] we live in Legacy of people's rights you
[37:02] don't have a right to do that
[37:06] he says dear brother sister if you

[37:09] Ghost run into the kingdom of God as
[37:12] quick as you can
[37:13] stealing time is on the enemy is coming
[37:16] like a flood he is raising a standard
[37:18] against it the drama he said the church

[37:25] friend you haven't got all the time to
[37:28] wait you better come now you better make
[37:30] it right today
[37:31] and make it now
[37:37] yeah he goes on to say the kingdom of
[37:39] God is within you therefore Legions and
[37:42] powers and the backing of the only
[37:44] Angels is in you
[37:48] do you see what what value there is in a
[37:50] kingdom what power days in the Kingdom
[37:53] he says you have the allegiance of
[37:55] angels and Powers at your disposal
[38:00] how by the deity of Christ by the
[38:03] baptismal are you reading that
[38:07] look for that amen you'll find it there
[38:09] he says the kingdom of God will be
[38:12] within you therefore the legions and
[38:14] powers and the backing of the Holy
[38:16] Angels is in you this morning by the
[38:18] deity of Christ by the baptism of the
[38:21] Holy Ghost
[38:25] we've gone too far

[39:04] of God the hour is here he is coming one
[39:07] of these days
[39:10] amen
[39:12] he goes on to say the church don't know
[39:14] the authority
[39:16] and he says holy ghost born men don't
[39:18] realize the authority
[39:20] and the authority that God has permitted
[39:22] to the church
[39:24] Christ said I'll give you the keys to
[39:26] the kingdom
[39:28] whatever you bind on Earth shall be
[39:30] bound in heaven amen whatever you lose
[39:33] will be loosed I give him Powers over
[39:35] serpents over all kinds of diseases
[39:38] nothing shall harm you
[39:40] he says exercise your faith
[39:44] Let it Loose

[40:22] and on fire for God
[40:24] I'll do more for the kingdom of God in
[40:27] one year's time
[40:28] then the whole church has done for two
[40:30] thousand years
[40:33] right
[40:35] we can get 500 people here in Phoenix
[40:38] we can get 500 people in Durban
[40:42] but they must be filled with the Holy
[40:44] Ghost and not fight for God he says I'll
[40:47] get them to do more for the kingdom of
[40:49] God in one year
[40:50] and for the last two thousand years
[40:55] what do we learn for that
[41:02] little man has been given to God giving
[41:05] to God God has used that amen
[41:09] pray for the Lord
[41:12] if you get into the heart of that quote
[41:14] what is he saying for two thousand years
[41:16] he's saying if I can get 500 people
[41:19] filled with the Holy Ghost and on fire
[41:20] for God will do more than two thousand
[41:22] years worth of work
[41:24] amen what is he saying because God can
[41:28] only use man as much as man would heal
[41:30] himself amen and now listen to this
[41:32] because the little we have given to God
[41:34] and we should be ashamed of it the
[41:36] little we have been used given to God he
[41:39] has used it powerfully
[41:41] but how much more if we surrender all
[41:44] right
[41:47] the little times we surrendered
[41:54] how much more we surrender daily to him
[41:57] we become his hands
[42:00] to become his feet
[42:02] we become his eyes we become his ears

[42:42] memory if you haven't got the Holy Ghost
[42:44] you're out of the kingdom of God
[42:46] you can't believe the supernatural
[42:48] because you have never been born again
[42:51] and when you're born again you have to
[42:53] believe the supernatural because you're
[42:56] Supernatural yourself

[43:53] know he says to bring down the power of
[43:55] the Holy Ghost amongst the people but
[43:57] their power that will raise her above
[43:59] these things and take her in
[44:01] at the same time
[44:05] now I want all of you to know if it
[44:07] wasn't for you the message would be no
[44:08] good
[44:10] because the message came for a people
[44:13] yes there's got to be somebody to
[44:15] believe it
[44:17] amen and as long as it's coming from God
[44:20] there's got to be someone to believe it
[44:22] and receive the message for the day
[44:27] when God sends forth something when God
[44:30] sends his gift into the Earth there must
[44:32] be someone there to receive their gift
[44:37] the problem will explain it in one
[44:40] sentence and he says a deep has got to
[44:42] respond to the call of the deep
[44:44] amen
[44:49] amen
[44:52] now we that have been coming to the
[44:53] message of the hour that have heard the
[44:55] message of the hour that have heard the
[44:57] prophet's message
[44:59] God has saved us
[45:02] can you say Amen
[45:05] can you glorify God for saving us amen
[45:08] because sometimes people in the message
[45:09] can't praise God for salvation
[45:12] we become any and I minded
[45:15] amen the basic things like salvation we
[45:18] never thank the Lord for
[45:21] but I want to thank you Lord for saving
[45:25] my soul
[45:26] I want to thank you Lord for making me
[45:31] or give God praise amen for his
[45:34] salvation
[45:34] [Applause]
[45:37] and he has filled us with his holy
[45:39] spirit amen amen now that he's filled us
[45:42] with his holy spirit he said he's come
[45:44] to give us the mind of Christ
[45:46] and you would know what he wants done
[45:49] with his word amen Christ wants to
[45:52] transform us from the Natural Things of
[45:55] this life and he wants to bring us into
[45:57] the perfect will of God by
[45:59] transformation amen you say how is he
[46:02] going to transform Me by his word
[46:05] he's doing it in this hour by his word
[46:07] that's why denominations are rejecting
[46:10] the word because the word is
[46:12] transforming power if they will only
[46:14] receive the word the word will transform
[46:16] them amen so they reject the word
[46:18] because they don't want to be
[46:20] transformed
[46:21] but even if you have casually accepted
[46:23] the word of God you will find some form
[46:25] of transformation in your life but to
[46:28] you have fully embrace the word of God
[46:30] there's no way you are to redeem remain
[46:32] the same but the transforming power of
[46:35] the Holy Ghost has taken that word and
[46:37] brought it back to your remembrance and
[46:39] you are not what you used to be but you
[46:42] have been changed
[46:45] thank you Lord
[46:47] if God transformed the Earth in Genesis
[46:50] 1
[46:51] which was void would that form
[46:54] and darkness cover the Earth
[46:58] it transformed it from chaos
[47:01] amen and he brought transformed the
[47:04] earth into a beautiful Eden
[47:07] I asked you how did he do it
[47:10] to the power of His spoken word
[47:15] amen
[47:18] [Music]
[47:19] then how is he transforming us
[47:23] now think of us we are like the Earth
[47:26] we were once like the Earth void
[47:29] Darkness cover the face of the deep
[47:31] David will go on to explain it like we
[47:34] were born in sin
[47:36] shaped in iniquity came into the world
[47:38] speaking lies
[47:40] but from the chaos of Darkness
[47:44] amen
[47:46] that point where we were lost and
[47:48] destined for help
[47:53] from the place
[47:55] God sent forth his word his word is like
[47:58] that light when he said let there be
[48:01] light
[48:03] from there
[48:06] we learned that we would have been lost
[48:09] and destined for help but we learned now
[48:11] that God had Eternal thoughts about us
[48:17] we learned that God had transforming
[48:19] thoughts about us
[48:21] he brought us apart before the world
[48:23] began and how we were in darkness and
[48:26] Chaos amen but the power of God's word
[48:29] he said let there be and the light of
[48:31] God's word penetrated through every
[48:33] darkness and found the seed that was
[48:36] laying in your heart
[48:37] amen you may be trapped in denominations
[48:40] and you would have died in denomination
[48:43] you ought to be trapped in a Hindu
[48:45] system or a a Tamil system or a Muslim
[48:48] system or a Catholic system or maybe
[48:50] even being an atheist and you would have
[48:53] died in that condition
[48:54] but if there was a seed within you the
[48:57] light of the word has reached you
[48:59] therefore you are sitting here today
[49:00] this morning
[49:04] amen the water to penetrate through
[49:08] every doubt
[49:10] amen
[49:12] surpasses didn't want you to receive the
[49:15] word but the light had to shine through
[49:18] amen they said stay away from it but
[49:20] that shade within you have to respond to
[49:23] the light
[49:26] amen
[49:30] you owe me being singing Hail Marys in
[49:32] the Catholic Church
[49:34] some of you like men went all to boy
[49:39] Ultra boy where's your candle
[49:46] but one day when the light of God's word

[50:21] to ask him when are you coming home when
[50:24] are you coming back to the kingdom of

[57:07] [Music]
[57:11] some of us choke on it how you can tell
[57:14] me to talk so boldly
[57:18] yeah which church you're going to be
[57:20] bible-believing Christians we're not
[57:22] denominational Christians

[57:55] to fulfill Thessalonians
[57:59] that the Lord himself shall descend from

[58:41] is only the beginning
[58:46] what are we investing our time
[58:50] what are we investing ourselves with
[58:54] the Bible says that Moses chose to
[58:56] suffer the Affliction with the people of
[58:58] God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[59:00] for a season
[59:03] he says he was esteeming the reproach of
[59:06] Christ greater riches than the treasures
[59:09] in Egypt
[59:10] for he had respect
[59:13] to the recompense of the reward he had
[59:16] respect to eternal life amen
[59:20] not like Esau now who had no respect
[59:25] yeah what the prophet says now we must
[59:27] hold to that regardless of what others
[59:30] other things take place he says always
[59:33] stay with that word
[59:35] always check out our motives and
[59:37] objectives if it's according to the word
[59:40] of God if it isn't leave it alone
[59:43] but if it's with the word of God and
[59:46] lines up with the word of God then you
[59:49] hold on to that
[59:52] amen

[1:00:28] they say to doing what
[1:00:30] it's an action word
[1:00:33] the Holy Ghost didn't come to make us
[1:00:35] church members
[1:00:37] the Holy Ghost came to fit us into the
[1:00:39] body and make us active members in the
[1:00:42] Kingdom
