Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ while we're standing we're going to turn to the book of 1st Samuel chapter 16 1 Samuel chapter 16 I thank Pastor Adrian for the opportunity to minister the word of the Lord and uh we are good friends uh and we've been friends before we become Pastors in the message been friends since the time of our youth amen and the friendship is just continuing and so we are happy um to have this invite and to be associated with him in the gospel like he had said and to all that are visiting all that are here this morning God blessings maybe one of you right TR the things that we will share will be a blessing uh to our hearts and we take something that I shared before we ask the Lord for his grace 1 Samuel 16 from verse 1 to 2 and then we're going to jump to verse 11 after that and the Lord said unto Samuel how long will thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel full thine horn with with oil and go and I will send the to Jesse the bethlehemite for I have provided me a king among his sons amen and Samuel said how can I go if Saul y he will kill me and the Lord said take an for thee and say I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord in verse 11 and Samuel said unto Jesse I yet all thy children and he said there remained yet the youngest and behold he keep of the sheep and Samuel said unto yes he sent and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither and he sent and brought him in that he was ready and with all of a beautiful countenance and God and God goodly to look look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he and Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel Rose and went to raar I want to turn to 1 Samuel chter 25 couple of verses there 1 Samuel CH 25 verse1 and Samuel died and all the Israelites were gathered together and lamented him and buried him in the house of abama and David arose and went down to the Wilderness of pan and there was a man in moan whose possessions were in caramel and and the man was very great and he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats and he was sharing a sheep in Cel very rich man indeed now the name of the man was nebal and the name of his wife Abigail she was a woman of good understanding in a woman of Revelation and of a beautiful countenance but the man was chish and evil in his doings and he was uh was of the House of Caleb and David heard in the wilderness that nabal did she sheep and David sent out 10 young men and David said unto the young men get you up to carel and go for go to nabal and greet him in my name thus shall I say to him that liveth in prosperity peace be both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that that thou H has now have commanded I have heard that thou has uh has sheer now thy Shepherds which were with us we Hur them not neither was their art missing unto them all the while there were in C as the young man ask the young men and they will show thee wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes so we come in a good day give I pray thee whatsoever cometh to thy hand unto thy servants and to thy son David and when David's young men came they spake to nabal according to all the those words in the name of David and sees nabal answered David servants and said who is David who is the son of Jesse There Be many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master shall I take shall I then take my bread and my water and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom I know not whence they be so David's young young men turned away and went again and came and told all those say the Lord bless the reading of his word you may take your seats this morning amen we got to just take for a title this morning recognizing the drum beat of change amen amen and I've just I've shortened the sermon a bit but it's still a long sermon so we'll just trust the Lord to give us Grace amen uh when we need to stop but um I was going to take a little bit of Abigail but will but I I thought that maybe that will just speak on the drum beat of change yes and um trust God will share something this morning to our hearts and it's a very beautiful story here in the Bible about David um and uh this woman Abigail Abigail we know she types the Bride of Jesus Christ and we'll trust the Lord and see how it unfolds and um we see in this story that we had just read the story of King David being anointed king the scripture here is showing us that the anointing is leaving one king King Saul and he is moving to another king means that there is a change here in the time in the days of Israel amen there is a change in um the season and uh you know always change is not well received yes and the kingdom was changing from one king to another king from One Tribe to another tribe and a dispensation was changing yet in the house of Israel and uh the prophet Samuel himself was afraid of this man King Saul and um and the Lord had said to uh the prophet Samuel go and just uh offer sacrifice so people will not know that you are going to anoint another king yes in other words if you if you now my if you uh if you're hearing me for the first time I preach a lot with types and shadows so you have to follow my thought you eventually you'll catch what I'm saying and uh so you find out J that this thing that was happen happening in the time of the calling and the anointing of King David the Lord is telling the prophet Samuel to keep it a secret means that go as if you are offering a sacrifice and the thing that you about to do this dispensational change will be a secret until the appointed time amen so yeah the prophet is going with a message of the hour he's going to unveil and reveal a dispensation change and that secret is going to be made known but if you read the story about Abigail and and nabal nabal does not catch that Myster but Abigail types the bride she catches the change of dispensation she recognizes that there is a new king she recognizes that there's a coming up a new king there's an anointing up a new king there is a season change amen so it's kept a secret until the appointed time Amen in other words until the abigailes rise upon the scene that secret is made known of the new king amen amen amen so the spiritual Minds like the prophet said the spiritual minds are always looking for a change they're always looking and they're always listening for the change and they know and they identify when the change comes and uh so we we trust the Lord the things that we saying will help us this morning and of course we're taking it out of what the prop has been saying so there's nothing new there's two characteres here a husband and a wife the husband is called nebal and the wife is known as Abigail now you notice here that neor did not recognize the change of God's anointed yes he missed the change of dispensation amen and I we say like this here this morning obviously he was not reading he was not listening to the tapes not reading the books of the prophet Samuel amen and that is why he missed the change neyar was not sensitive to the change in Israel he was not careful to follow the prophet follow the line of inspiration follow the unveiling of God Amen and so it was Samuel the prophet that anointed Saul as king it was Samuel the prophet that the word of the Lord came to all the time because the word comes to the prophets amen amen it was Samuel the prophet that said to King Saul that you have rejected the word of the Lord and God has rejected you as king surely this news must have spread people would have known what had happened how God had rejected Saul and we know not everybody will accept it like you see the character nebor when God had rejected Saul and God is choosing a new king Neal rejects the change nebal is the one that's not letting go of the light of another day he's holding on to a message up another day he's holding he's holding on to another message and the message has moved on because the prophet says Revelation is Progressive amen and the moment you stop and you say this is it you become a denomination you put a w around yourself because the word keeps opening and falling until we go into the translation and so Samuel went to the house of Jesse and we know that Samuel anointed a Shepherd boy to be king over Israel and when Saul got to hear about this he sought to kill David and you know what Saul is trying to do he's trying to kill the influence of David he's trying to kill the ministry of David he's trying to kill the word for this day and this age now s is not a person brother and sister what we preaching today Sol is not a person Sol is a spirit Spirit that spirit that rises up against change yes Saia he rejects the word of God Saul types the Pentecostal Church you notice here when Saul was anointed by Samuel the spirit of the Lord come upon him and he began to get into the spirit and prophesy and the people were asking he saw one of the prophets you see a of Pentecost a type of those with a Pentecostal understanding of the word in other words saw type a Pentecostal Revival and sa yeah he's the one that disbelieved the word of the prophet Samuel he rejected Samuel he rejects the progression of the word just like the Pentecostal church and Prophet William bam had come to a Pentecostal Church first but when the the word began to open up yes then they rejected the message they rejected the word and stayed as a denomination yes like when Jesus he had preached thousands that followed him big churches big revivals and then when he said eat my flesh and drink my blood it was giving the revelation of the seven SE amen that's when there was only 12 that remain and so we find it's the same thing here so long as the prophet could have healing and discernment all of those things that were B but when he said eat my flesh and drink my blood have a revelation of who he said right now then the numbers began to dwindle amen what happened a spirit of Sal comes upon the church and they reject the message of the hour amen amen the biggest problem that we have in the message is that we're holding on to a Pentecostal teaching of the word we are holding on to a Pentecostal understanding of the word and the prophet says when the seals have been opened the Bible becomes a brand new book Hallelujah you cannot read it the same you have to read it through a prop with eagle eyes amenah Glory now I just dropped this in here it just come to me when I was sitting in the room and I trust that it uh you will receive it well like like like like the Rapture and the coming of the Lord the Pentecost will have this big idea that there's going to be a great big meeting in the end and yet it's a secret catching away a secret catching away nobody is going to know it no one's going to see it he says there people going to go missing and people go missing every single day it's common for people to go missing and when the Rapture goes he says the people will go bride will go missing and the world will not even know it a secret catching way of the Lord yet a Pentecost understanding is he will come and all eyes will see him yes now you know Jesus himself spoke about his second coming m and you find out that Paul being a dispensational prophet he preached the second coming and you know that Paul never said what Jesus said all that Paul began to speak about is the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout of voice in a trump now you know Jesus never said those words but you take Paul's words because Paul's a dispensational prophet now the Pentecostal understanding is that when he comes there's going to be a shout of voice a trump a resurrection a Rapture all is going to take place they put it in the future but now we had another dispensational prop oh yes William B is come and he preached the second coming of the Lord and he said the shout that Paul spoke about is a message that goes for Hallelujah in other words he's not putting in a future event he's saying the shot is on right now and the Paul says when he descends from Heaven he comes with a shout yes amen means that the coming of this Mighty Angel the coming of Christ he comes with a shout message amen now I'm trying to say something this morning oh thank is there's a denominational understanding that has been lurking around the message but now he Prophet now comes to take away the den denomination understanding of the scriptures amen amen there's a change in the kingship there's a change of dispensation it's leaving Saul and it's coming to King David amen yes so you find out Prophet shout is a message that goes forth and this message that goes for must be a rapturing message it must be a message that gives you rapturing faith and says rapturing faith lays in those standards which is in that seven seal means that the message that goes for is the message of the Seven Seals it's that message that goes for that will give us Rapture in FA that is the shout message that we are hearing and listening to brother sisters of course it's not a future event the Rapture process has started the bride now is feeding on the word the word is becoming flesh and says he says like your natural body it starts up in the wom of your mother it starts up from a little cell at that starts up at your spine and it grows cell upon cell upon cell Hallelujah he said if it's a cell of a human it'll produce a human the cell of a dog will produce a dog amen it says in the wh of a mother when the cell is fully formed then she burs that baby and probably the same thing with the bride of Christ she's eating the word and inside of her a word body is building and it's it's building word upon word upon word upon word and remember a human cell will produce a human body and a word cell must produce a word body inside of you there's a one body that is being built and one of these days when the body is ready we are going to B this body we are going to give birth to a body change and we are going to go into a rapur wonderful thank you so we are not holding on to a denom understanding of the word we know our day and our message we know what's happening brothers and sisters the first coming the first coming was a prophecy and there were scribes there were Pharisees there were priests there were all lot of holy people and yet none of them knew the hour they none of knew the day of the first coming except one person Mary and to Mary was revealed the day the hour the moment she's the one had birth pain she's the one had an angel visitation she's the one that knew about the coming and she's the one that took the message to Elizabeth and spoke about that coming amen it is the same yesterday today and forever the second coming will not be any different it must an angel must visit another Mary a virgin of the word and the angel has come brothers and sisters and he has told us that we've been highly favored and we have received the message of the hour we know about the second coming we know the when the how we know his nature we know him this hour because it must be revealed to us hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord notice here David in the Bible David said the word of the Lord have I hid in my heart and we read the life of David he was just a humble Shepherd boy that was going to become king but God chose him God called him God by for knowledge known the heart of David you know I was saying I just dropped this in here I was saying to somebody you know David was a man after God's Own Heart yet David was so so full of false so full of mistakes David committed adultery he even killed bba's husband to have her as his own wife and yet God said David a man after my own heart because the heart of God is a forgiving heart am amen and and the prophet says he says a righteous man is not a sinless man but a man that knows how to repent when he makes a mistake he says that what that's what David was David was not a right he was a righteous man because he knew how to confess his sins to the LA amen and that's what makes him a man after God's Own Heart yet David says the word of the Lord have I hidden my heart that I will not sin against it we know the word is Christ it's Christ the word that's hidden his heart Christ hiding in Simplicity and he always hides in Simplicity and he reveals himself in the same way David said the word is in my heart and that he will not sin against God and sin his unbelief in other words that I will not disbelieve the word of the Lord in my day and age David was anointed of God to be king of an everlasting Kingdom the scripture says and David says I will hide the word in my heart I will not die about the promised word for my day and for my age when doubts arise and doubts arise about God's word doubts arise about who we are David is saying the word have I hid in my heart I will not disbelieve I will not doubt David here is full of Trials his life is full of discouragements and disappointments but yet he was still the anointed of God anointed king by prophet Samuel you find out yeah that he was rejected by Saul Saul tried many times to kill David now you have to be in the spiritual yeah that Saul is trying to K kill the influence of the ministry of David amen yes when you think that Saul should be spiritual Saul should show a spirit of meekness Saul should be accepting God's Will and God's word yes Saul is persecuting the anointed of God for the day yes yeah Saul was rejecting the new day Saul was rejecting the new message Saul was was rejecting the new dispensation Saul was rejecting the new king that David had to stand the persecution because he knew who he was and he knew the promised work for the day am that's why he can say the word of the Lord have I hid in my heart I will not disbelieve the promises that were made in this day through a prophet a prophet Samuel amen hallelujah praise the Lord just going to skip a little bit the word is hid in the heart and the word does not just come into any heart because the Bible says the heart of a man is Stony yes man is born in sin man is born with disbelief his birth is Stony he's not created in a natural bird to hide God in his heart and yet David says I hide the word of the Lord in my heart how do you get a heart in a condition to receive the word because David could say Lord create in me a clean heart renew a right Spirit within me a man's heart is a Stony heart but it needs to change and receive the word of the Lord in his heart amen the prophet says the heart of man thinks he knows more than God he says and God cannot touch that Stony heart so when a man can humble himself and realize it's it's not what I know but it's what you will show me to the prophet to the message to to your scriptures this hourl God's ways and God's nature does not change amen the moment the man thinks like the man thinks he knows more than God then his heart becomes a ston God cannot reveal anymore to amen that's right the Bible says about the word of God he says I'll write my laws in your heart in the tablets of your hearts mean I will put my word into your heart and I will change the heart of a man amen take away the Stony art like Ezekiel said and put a heart of Flesh now put my spirit in you which is the holy spirit but says when the Holy Spirit comes into a man he says it changes the nature of the man amen hallelujah so that your spirit can get on with his Spirit yes there's no thinking faculties in the heart and yet the scripture says as a man think it in his heart and says he says why he said because in the heart of a man is a place called a soul yes amen he says in that that Soul there is a place where God comes and dwells in a man amen he says that place there is the Throne of God Almighty himself the influence of man comes from the soul and son and a daughter of God that's born again baptized in the Holy Spirit God dwells in the soul of the man that becomes the controll Tower of that man God comes and sits in the place and a man does not think with his head out that he starts to think with his heart amen the influence comes from God himself sitting on the throne praise the Lord as a man think it in his heart man has always had the tendency to reason the word with his mind and that's why a man is not allowed to think with his mind but to think with his heart yes to believe to have faith you know I'm just I'm just skipping my notes here but you know the Lord said to Moses he said to Moses he said he said I'm going to speak to you I'm going to speak to you and through you to the people but I'm going to speak mouth to mouth Yes you know why the Lord was speaking mou to mount to Moses because at the burning bush the Lord said to Moses I've called you to go and deliver my people and then Moses all of these excuses all of this all of the reasons why Moses could not do it Moses was a stammerer and Mo and and Pharaoh had a big army he says how will Pharaoh believe in all of those things and Moses was reasoning in his mind yes why God was speaking Moses was hearing and Moses was reasoning in his mind and so the Lord come to Mo and says now this time in the wilderness he says I'm not going to speak you like that now I'm going to speak mouth to mouth he going to come from the mouth of God through the mouth of the Prophet it's going to bypass his hearing bypass his thinking bypass his understanding amen bypass human reasoning amen what I'm saying this morning is that's how God speaks amen not our years this morning where it goes into our mind and then we have to reason it to the Natural mind it has to make sense to us amen but God is going to speak mouth to mouth God is going to speak from the heart to the mouth God is going to speak where it's no more man's intellect man's reasoning and man's understanding but man now must believe by faith the things that he he and God speaks through great Prophets You Love the Lord amen you noce here David is on the run from Saul and um he passes by the sheep and the servants are neighbor and the pro and the Bible says here that the prophet Samuel is dead but you notice the prophet is off the scene but the prophet introduced a new king amen the prophet you pointed to another king the prophet you pointed to another one in other words what Samuel is what Sam's happening in the life of Samuel is not I as decrease now he must increase to catch the mystery of David Saul was anointed with a vial of oil which a vile is just a small bottle a measure of oil but David was anointed with a horn of oil mean that David was anointed with a greater measure of the word of the Holy Ghost the horn speaks of power the horn is the word and the horn speaks of power the word has the power to change the horn is the word but the oil in the heart is the Holy Ghost other words David in Ty is Anointed with the fullness which is the word and the spirit the Dynamics and the mechanics he becomes in t the fullness of God in the book of Christ The Mystery of God reveal the prophet says the fullness is back in the church amen amen in other words if the fullness is back in the church means the one that is Anointed with the Horn of oil has come Amen in other words we are not living under the dispensation of Saul the king but the church now is moved to David the king that has come Anointed with the fullness that is back in the church you love the Lord am you look at the scripture so here has the tip you can in scripture of 1 Chronicles chapter 2:15 the Bible says David is the Seventh Son of Jesse which means it times the L this in church age but if you read 1st Samuel chapter 17 it says David was the eighth son of Jesse yes and of course if you read the Bible with just natural eyes it looks like a contradiction but to my understanding I don't see any contradiction because this Prophet came to call a bride of Jesus Christ you know the prophet says that we are not in the ludin churches yes we are not in the Methodist churches he says we not even in the Pentecostal churches he said but we are in the bright age Amen in other words what the prophet William had come to do he' come to that seven Church age Hallelujah he' come to call a bride out of the seventh but he's taking her out of the seven into the bride which becomes in type the eight amen so you notice in Tye David David is of the seven in the one scripture but in another scripture David is up the eight why the seventh is of the eight and the eight is of the seventh in other words the church is being called under the ministry of David is called out of the Pentecostal age into the bright age Hallelujah there has to be a bright age this is the Eighth Day not the eighth age we are not in the Pentecostal age we in the bright age when the age of the open door amen Revelation 3 is the seven such ages but Revelation 4 is an Open Door amen Amber man says the door is Christ means the open door is the open revealed Christ taking us out of the lean Church of Revelation chapter 3 into the bright age amen you love the Lord amen I'm showing in typ here the ministry of David brothers and sisters in the temple in the most holy place this there's a lampstand with seven lamps types to seven Church age yes but the high priest does not stay there he goes into the most holy place he goes beyond the seven candlesticks he goes beyond the seven Church ages he's going beyond the church age light he going into the sh light he's going into the bright light Hallelujah the scripture says we are made Kings and Priests hallelujah mean that if we are Kings and Priests we are not living in the church AG life amen we have to leave the church a light of the Holy place and go into the most holy place we have to go into the sh light which is a bright light because we are Kings and Priests amen we have to come out of the Pentecostal age and we have to go into the bright age the seventh is of the eth and the E is of the seventh we're coming out of the seventh but we are going into the E amen and our King is King David you love the Lord praise the Lord we're moving into the eth we're coming out of the seventh the E types eternity you know that every prophet and messenger from Genesis to Revelation was subject to time they had a beginning and they had an end but in this day we have been introduced to Christ we have been introduced to the one that comes after the seventh messenger he is the eighth one but he is the Eternal one amen amen and when he comes he says time shall be no more am in other words he coming out of time he going into the eight you love the Lord amen all the prophets of time were born in flesh but this one that comes is not from time is from eternity it's Christ himself the word that has come Heaven that will pass away pass away but the word shall remain the word himself Has Come Today that's why the angel said time shall be no more means that it's there's no more Earthly Messengers now it's in Heavenly messenger it's no more messengers of time but it's a messenger of Eternity that's coming to take a bride that comes from eternity and she's going back to Eternity yes amen thank he who started the work in the beginning will be the one that will finish the work Hallelujah the one that started it was the one from eternity that come in Eden he was the messenger at Eden he was the Eternal messenger that come down in Eden now after all the messengers of time have come and gone the one that started in Eden is the same one that comes today and he'll finish the work and take us in a Rapture not a messenger of time but a messenger of Eternity and he says time shall be no more you love the Lord amen amen you notice here that Samuel had to introduce David and then Samuel had to decrease means that when the prophet introduces the King King David he must decrease so King David can increase and says the seventh angel is on Earth at the coming of the mighty Angel amen and the coming of the mighty angel that means that Samuel of today must decrease so he can increase now the story of David when David comes he sends word and he greets neighbor and he's greeting and he says to his men greet him in my name now if you if you listen to the proverb says what is the name of the Lord it says the name of the Lord is the word interpreted for your day in other words what David is saying to his men go and give neighbor the revelation of the word for today go and reveal to nebor that there's a new anointed king amen amen means GRE him in my name means preach this message go and preach Revelation 10 go and preach the one that has come today tell him greet him in my name the name of the Lord is the word revealed for your day yes and he says to nabal shalom means at his coming there's a message of shalom amise Lord if you read the message Shalom if you know says he appeared on Sunset yes 1963 he said it's our Lord up there he said and his message is Shalom his King David has come and yeah he's come to neighbor he says bre them in my name means give him the interpretation of what is happening today who has come who is the anointed king neighbor rejects that word but his message is Shalom the some somebody that has to catch a shallow message you love the Lord amen remember David is the king and he's King from the tribe of Judah means the lion of the tribe of Judah yes amen the coming King means he type Revelation 101 King Shalom King MDC the one that is coming in this hour in this day notice neighor the Bible Bible says nebal is a very rich man in other words he's rich is increased in Goods is the type of Leia yes is the type of those under the Pentecostal teaching of the word now I want to say this brothers and sisters you know if you read the Bible as a Bible story then the Bible is a closed book to you yes yes that's right and it makes it just a dead story book but the scripture say he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and when you read the scripture you have to see your day and your message in the scripture the Bible says the prophets the kings of old they type Jesus Christ but the women of the Bible types the Bride of Jesus Christ and every time you read about Abigail Sarah Rebecca and all of those zoom in you got to see yourself in scripture and those characters has to become alive in you because all of those Natures that laid in those woman the nature of Sarah the nature of Rebecca the nature of Ruth all of those Natures of those woman they're actually inside of the the soul of you and I the very character the very Gene the very nature is inside of us all that is waiting for is a light of the word to go over to come over the the gene of those characters and it'll bring it to life in your amen because if Mary was a type who is she a type of IFC was a type who he should type off if Ru is a type who is should type off yes if Abigail is a type who is should type off and if we are the real person then we must be able to express all of those characters and attribute in this day we don't read this Bible as a Bible story we don't read it as a closed book but it's an open book and characters become alive in our day and our age and so if there was a neighbor that was rejecting the word and there was an Abigail that was going to receive it I believe I'm speaking to Abigail this morning am amen those that will catch the Revelation those that will see the season change those that will see the dispensation change those that will see the king king of Judah the lion of the tribe of Judah coming in this hour those that don't hear a message from prophet Samuel and know that he has come you love the Lord am Abigails it it they won't manif faes they'll respond when it's revealed am amen glory thank you Lord NE he is Rich and increased in Goods the type of leysia blind wretched and naked don't even know him means he types A leodis in jur and he rejects the message of David he rejects the coming of the anointed work for his day amen yet the wife Abigail the time of the Bride she has a revelation that there's a change of the Kings am amen I haven't got time to do it this morning but if you read the scripture she prophesies about David abigael recognizes a day and a message she recognizes the change in dispensation there's a change in the drum beat of God's musical Neal did not receive the change but Abigail caught the change why the Bible says she was a woman of understanding means a woman of Revelation and I believe she's here this morning amen she heard the beat change she's with the program of God the prophet speaks of a symphony we'll try and close it up with this because I'm trying to just bring a point this morning and I'd love to speak about abigel because there's so much of things around her life but but the inspiration this morning is to bring this point through you brother mam speaks about a musical he speaks about about a symphony he speaks about a music orchestra a musical play or a musical drama and he said you take the music piece written by beatoven he says beatoven is the composer of that Musical and he writes a musical and it's an antitype of God type of God where God uh be types God God is this great composer God is a composer of his own Symphony his own Musical and the prophet says the Symphony of God is the word of God so like beat oven composes a a symphony God himself is this great composer and the symphony is a symphony of his word and just like Pete over the composer he knows the beginning from the end God knows the beginning from the end of his musical amen yes God knows knows this drama how it's going to play out yes amen God knows the characters in this drama thank God knows all things about this drama and and we have this drama in our hands daily daily we are reading a symphony daily we are reading God's musical daily we are seeing Junctions and and musicals and sounds and pauses and all of those things in the word of God daily we are reading and we are seeing dispensational changes probably only composer knows the beginning from the ending God is the only one that knows the beginning from the ending and he knows how this drama is going to play out now the P said there's a director of the musical amen the director is the one with a little back stick in his hand and he's the one that he directs the entire Orchestra the symphony yes and so the musicians they watch him they watch his hand movement and they follow the director amen amen amen now you have to follow the director carefully cuz if you don't follow the director carefully you're going to have a big noise you're going to mess up the whole musical you're going to mess up the whole Symphony now the prophet says in order for the director to direct the symphony correctly he says that the director must get into the spirit of beat over yes amen so that it can be line upon line precept upon precept amen the director sometime they call him the conductor and he saids that if the if he does not get into the spirit of the composer then he'll just mess up the whole piece oh yeah you'll have a gr a cow eating grass on the treetop will misin temper the word dislocate the word misplace the word the director or the conductor of the Symphony of God is this Prophet William BR that is coming this day he coming he's been directing the symphony for us brother and sisters yes amen and the problem says what happens to the director when he gets into the spirit of beatoven he says then the spirit of beov comes into him now Hebrews 1 verse1 God who had Su times in divers manners spake in times pass unto the prophets but unto the fathers by the prophets you know says that the word by is the wrong word that is used there he says God did not speak by the prophets God speaks in the prophets now the word comes in the prophets and the prophets give out the word here is our Prophet that is a director of this musical he gets into the spirit of the composer in other words the spirit of the composer must come into this prophet in order for him to direct a musical not for him to take us to the word and reveal the mysteries of this Bible you love the Lord amen it's the same thing with us this morning yes if we get into the spirit of the composer then the spirit of the composer will come into US amen the anointed word will come into US lighting up the scripture for our day but says there's too many directors there's too many directors that are not in the spirit of the composer amen that's right he says that is why the symphony is not in harmony with the music sheet then you got different doctrin different things different ideas Creeds and dogmas he says they're not in tune with the with the Sy with the with the composer not in harmony too many directors not in the spirit of the composer they're making Creed they're following a tradition of a Pentecostal teaching teaching bringing denominational Traditions into the message of yah amen then it sounds all fuzzy and muzzled up because the directors have not come into harmony with the composer they're beating up something that's not in the word we've got to get into the Promised word for our day amen going to read you a few quotations just to kind of tie this whole thing up in the Shalom message 641 1 12 paragraph 166 64112 Shalom parag 166 he said well let me give you some T here just a minute do you know what a symphony is he says I know you do it's a music It's a drama I see they act it out you little children you'll understand you remember in school I believe you have what is called the little Russian Symphony sometimes they act out on the drums you know it's called the little woodpecker and that got in into the woods and they had the fluttering and the beating on the drums and the things and you hear all you hear all as you go through the symphony as they played they play it I forget the name of that Peter and the Wolf that's right Peter and the Wolf that's a Russian Symphony uh they don't they don't have they have little figures flying around playing it out but they play it on drums but KN in some words and make drums and sounds and things and it plays out it acts so you understand plays so 168 he says now to you ad the scripture is God's Symphony yes Hallelujah he says only the composer which is God he knows what it really means and he reveals it to those who are listening who are interested in knowing what the drama is amen but you have to know about a symphony first you see it's not just something you see it's changing this Junctions of the word of the music it throws sometime it's going this way for a while and a certain beat after after a while it changes around what is it to to you who wouldn't understand it or don't know nothing about it not interested in it it's just a racket it's a fuss but to those who know about it they are watching for it they know it's coming hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord unquote God's word is the symphony the Bible is God's music music sheet yes we had a prophet that got into the spirit of the composer that went into the thoughts of God amen amen and it told us about this God who was Elohim God that was self-existing God that existed and covered all space and time and this God had inside of him attributes and inside of this God was a symphony a symphony of his word a musical a Musical sheet that he wanted to express amen means that God who was Elohim St existing he wanted to write out a Musical sheet so he began to condescend and he began to change his form and express the symphony in the logos the Elohim began to change from Spirit being into the word into the logos from invisible to something that become visible he become the symphony himself the logos the word the first thing he does in this Symphony like all Symphonies he starts now to create Angels listen we are talking about the Symphony of God Amen his word he starts to create Angels because says he was not even God yet he was Elohim himself existing God means object of worship and so he creates Angel and watch how the symphony starts angels that created angels start to sing holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty can you hear it this morning brothers and sisters amen God before the foundation of the world when everything was silent he existed alone but inside of him was a Musical sheet inside of him was a symphony inside of him was attributes and he wanted to write out this Symphony he began to express himself into the L of the word he creates angels and the symphony starts amen holy holy holy to the Lord God Almighty now we are listening to the symphony that started before the foundation of the world the musical has started and we enjoying this syy am angels voices singing Holy Is God almighty God begins to express his attributes in this musical the Symphony of his word he starts to create the heavens he starts to creates the lights the Sun the moon and the stars what's happening the stage lights are on oh yes the performance has started lights are on brothers and sisters amen you love the Lord amen I hope you can picture it amen I hope you're not you're not stuck in the dimension I hope you're not stuck feeling the heat because if you are transported this morning and you are in that Symphony this morning I'm telling you're not even going to feel hot you're going to figet about everything that's happening around us and you start you're going to start to enjoy the symphony that started before the foundation of the world Amen it starts to create the heavens the Sun the moon the stars the lights the stage lights are on it starts to create the Earth the sea creatures the animals and all and all start to move and to and start to make sounds and all of those things hope you can hear it the birds are chirping in the sky the Symphony of God's word the lion is rowing in the jungle the Symphony of God's word elephant is trumpeting the Symphony of God God's musical is got sounds God's musical is not like we you see a Bible and we can hear and see nothing no actually when you start to read God's musical there's trumpets yes there's Lions rowing there's birds chirping there's silence there's all of those things in this Symphony thank you Lord God creates animals he creates Birds he creates the sea all of those things and his noise and his activity this symphony is playing out then God makes man and and he gives man dominion over this Symphony Adam direct the symphony Adam you move and the stream will move Adam can move the tree Adam was given dominion over the Symphony of God's word Adam was supposed to call us by name in that Symphony God blessed it on the seventh day means there was a [Music] silence you know the musical they say musical rest is called a silence means god in his Symphony comes to a musical rest on the seventh day there's a silence in the silence what is God doing he's pulling out a bride from the side of Adam amen you love the Lord amen amen can you see the symphony this morning that if the first silence pull out a bride in that in that in this Symphony of God's musical what must a silence do today am means that if you followed the symphony and you seen the silence and you were watching and you caught what happened in the silence means as you progressed in the word in the Symphony of God's word and you seen another then you would have already known that in the silence here God is resting God is resting because someone's coming to Dominion God is resting because a pride is being pulled out you so there's a silence in Eden there's a rest in Eden in musical s silence you read the entire Bible God's musical there's trumpet sounding at the Trump sound of a trumpet knees will bow when they cross the Red Sea Mariam pulls out a tamarine and she starts to praise the Lord Moses gets into the spirit and starts to praise the lord it's God Symphony when the priest start to blow the trumpets they announce a feast they announce a war god Symphony David under the anointing plays a h and evil spirit say leave God Symphony yes amen what am I saying this morning this is a symphony amen this is not musical instruments this got you got got people musicians that are playing those instruments there's silences there's Junctions there it's all all of those things in this Symphony if you want to understand you're got to get into the spirit of the and then you're going to see this Bible become alive Hallelujah get caught up into dis yes the silence is this HS there trumpets there Thunders all a part of God's Symphony to the person that don't understand the symphony it becomes just a noise it becomes just a story it remains a closed book yes but to those that know and understand a symphony to them they catching the scenes as it opens amen thank Lord Shalom 64112 parag 179 the prophet says here hope I'm not taking too much time I'll try and round it up here remember the comp 17 remember the composer knows the end from the beginning he knows all about it that's the reason he could write it correctly now you must be begin with him you must begin if you want to hear a symphony you begin with him like in the m music at the symphony you listen you know what it says it's going to be what the symphony is it says when you begin to listen at the music and you know what it is so you know just about bam speaks like this so you just catch me as I as I go along he says yes where a certain thing takes place now it's got to change says when you are following the symphony you'll be watching for the change and all those things said now it's got to change now to anybody else that don't know nothing about you see they just walked in and sat down it's just a bunch of nonsense rattling noise but the one who knows what it is it's beat out with the music jumed out with the notes it's trumpeted with trumpets it's strung on HS it's played with a violin it's beat on the base it's sounded by trumpets it's beats on the drums the whole thing together in Rhythm it makes the drama till you can close your eyes and live in itall Hallelujah he says man could close his mortal eyes to Earthly sight and live in the presence of Jesus Christ when you see his word being beat out in this great Symphony that we're living in now changing you must begin in the symphony the only thing you can do if you're in the symphony then you start you begin to get into into the Rhythm yes amen that's the way you do God you don't stand up and look at it you get into the rhythm of it how do you get in there you born into it amen into the rhythm of the word when you become part of that word amen you had to become part of the dance to get out of the dance you had to become part of the ball game something you're interested in to get into the ball game I hope you are interested this morning Hallelujah you have to become part of the word to know God's Symphony yes amen his symphony is very explained you understand and you're marching with the beat of the time you're watching for it the works that I do you shall also amen Greater Works than this shall you do these last days he said oh my the great changing of the time amen we get into the beat the beat of the word find his purpose the hour that we're living get into the rhythm of it how does it if you get into the word you find out how he did it at the beginning then you know what he's doing all the time unquote amen we got to get into the rhythm of his word being born into it being part of the word you're watching for the change brothers and sisters like the prophet says the Greater Works that have been promised you as the word keeps changing as a dispens stions keep changing you are getting into the rhythm of the change you understand how God is manifesting in the hour that you are living in the prophet says God has moved out through history with the rhythm of his promised word and he vindicates the word to the elect of each age and the elect catches the change for the age every time there's a rhythm change every time there's a dispensation change there's a change of drum beats the elect catches a change am amen the drum beats different the prophet says to show that there's a change yes can I give you an example amen I hope you're not tired of me let me give you an example what the prophet is saying about the drum beat that changes if you're watching a musical drama while you're watching a film and the scene is a very exciting scene then what the drums will do the drums actually giv you the beat for that scene and the drum goes or something like right there and everybody know it's a happy excited scene and they all caught up they under expectation for a nice scene but if the scene is going to change and in some maybe some Forest some prehistoric dinosaur is going to come and just bite everyone's heads off then the drum beat has to change that's what the prophet saying and the drum beat is telling you about the change yes and the drum beat is is is expressing the scene that's and then the drum beat from a from a happy beat he'll go to so people he the drum beat and suddenly they know oh the scene has changed there no more happy scene but they looking because something is going to happen that's going to change the atmosphere hallelujah amen so brother is saying here that there is a drum beat of change and those that are listening and looking they know when the beat of the Dum is changing amen they know to expect something different to happen am amen you love the Lord amen with that in mind paragraph 210 the same book it says when the real word of God falls upon the Vindicator upon the seed they see the Vindication of the word they recognize it they're looking at the word they know the junction they know the time they know the change they know the beat that's supposed to be in that hour Hallelujah they know the beat they know the time they know how it's supposed to go you see only the elect knows it let me just one the elect catches the the beat change the elect catches the change of dispensation yes the elect who types who types advate she's the one that realized that there was a change in King the proph say only the composer knows the word what the word really means he reveals it to those who are listening those who are interested in knowing what the drum beat is telling us let's put it together like this the Pharisees and the Sadducees 2,000 years ago the scribes holy men of the Bible they were reading God's music sheet called the Torah they were reading the music sheet and they were waiting for messiah to come you understand what I'm saying with all of these things now won't become nonsense and an noise they're reading a music sheet they're waiting for the Messiah to come but the problem with the Sadducees and the Pharisees they were not in the spirit of the composer means the spirit of the composer was not inside of them they could not recognize the drum beat of change they had the very messiah in their midst God veiled in human flesh but yet they were stuck in another scene of the symphony what they were reading in the music sheet was an actual scene that had taken place that's what they said Moses and Moses and Moses said this and Moses gave and Moses was that in the music sheet yes that was in the music sheet amen was that a scene in God's music she sheet yes it was a scene but the scene had played out and the scene had changed there was a drum beat of change Moses said the Lord thy God he would send a prophet liken unto me and this Prophet was standing in human flesh and the Pharisees SES they're reading the God's Symphony they're reading God's musical but they are stuck in the old scene yes like what answer the greatest deception in the church is living in a glare off another day amen mean that you're feasting on the word that had come yesterday and you're missing what he is doing right now right amen the problem with the church always has been is you're thanking God for what he done we're praising God for what he's going to do but we are missing what God is doing right now and the sad is Pharisees we thankk God for Moses Moses said there'll be a prophet Moses said there'll be a messiah and Messiah was there and they were missing the unfolding and the drum beat of change why they were not in the spirit of the composer they were stuck in Old scene the very Messiah was robed in human flesh and they missed it brothers and sisters worshiping the god of Moses worshiping the Wilderness God worshiping the god that appear appeared in a PO of fire worshiping the god that appeared in the cloud worshiping the God that was behind Badger skin in the temple but the same God had changed his tent from Badger skin to human skin veils in Jesus Christ and they missed the drum be of change but they were reading the musical they failed to see God materialized in front of them yes they were at a junction and they missed it they heard the noise but they had wanted nothing to do with the noise the crowd was making a noise people were testifying the blind were seeing the dead were being raised they heard the noise they heard the musical but to them it was a big noise why they were not in the spirit of the composer they did not get into the rhythm of the music they missed the drum beat of change amen when they were given the opportunity to said crucify Jesus give us barabus you see they could not read the music she right they kept looking back stuck in the old scene but yet in the very same day there was a woman at the well she come on a normal day to the well yes she's attracted to the Waters of Life what seemed like a normal day for her she comes and she meets a man she meets a man which looks like every other Normal Man nothing different about Jesus he looked like a Jewish man he dressed like a Jewish man he spoke like a Jewish man she even said it's not right for a Jew to speak to Samaritan why because in whatever he was he looked like a Jew so common so simple he just Blended in with the crowd and that's why sades and Pharisees and all of them missed it but yes this woman yeah the Samaritan woman she comes to the well on a normal day and a conversation begins to take place and the prophet says he is contacting her spirit but while he is contacting her spirit she's getting into the spirit of the composer too there's something happening on both ends when he's Discerning a heart she's getting into the spirit of the composer why brothers and sisters with her own confession she said we know our fathers told us when Messiah come she knew the musical ready amen she was well acquainted with God's Symphony she had been reading the Symphony of God's word and she knew that Messiah will come and the son of Messiah will be discernment so yes she's confessing and something that she's been following all the time in other words this woman at the well was watching for the drum beat of change she was watching for the sign of Messiah you love the Lord amen amen she's getting into the spirit of the composer watching for the drum beat of change she had been reading the Musical sheet all these years The Prophecy of the Messiah that would come and she know the sign of Messiah because she has read it in the music sheet she known about MDC coming to Sarah and Abraham having his back turned to the tent Discerning a heart was God in human flesh she read about Solomon Discerning the heart of the queen and B said was God in human flesh Discerning the heart of Solomon because the word is a discerner the word become flesh in other words she knew the sign of Messiah and she was listening to the drum beat of change amen he said go call your husband she said I am none he said you are rightly spoken you had five and the one that you you living with is not even your husband that was enough for her she caught the drum deed of change amen amen something triggered Within heart she noticed that in God's Symphony there was a change yes the Pharisees the S read the same Bible that she read and they missed it all together but she recognized the word for hour look what brother says here God God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief 64121 par 102 God's word Calla for a total separation from unbelief he said oh the symphony beat talking about Jesus and the Samaran woman he said oh the symphony beat it went just exactly right from a low Plum to a high and then she ran into the City and said come and see a man who had told me these things that I've done is this the very Messiah isn't this the very Messiah that we look forward to suddenly that beat went from a low to a high he said one of the she understood what the music sheet was in that Symphony amen that separates belief from unbelief not come by a church Faith cometh by hearing the word of God knowing what it is now we find the same thing today in the Shalom message paragraph 2 209 we speaking about the same thing about this woman that caught the change of the jum bees he said paragra 29 he said I am he that was enough why the rhythm beat out she was looking for that change from a church denomination to a Vindicated Messiah amen and there he stood the Messiah that Moses spoke of the Lord your God shall raise a prophet like unto me there he is the Rhythm changed the Vindicated SE recognized it amen now I hope this morning brothers and sisters you're not thinking about the woman as the well cuz we're not preaching to her amen we're preaching about her to her amen yeah CU you are that woman this morning Hallelujah that catches a drum beat of change that many are going to read this Musical sheet and they are waiting for some to come and this woman here has read this he says oh we see sign of Messiah we know when Messiah comes he'll do these things he's not this the very Messiah that was promised to come Hallelujah parag 210 when the real word of God falls upon the Vindicator upon the sea and they see the Vindication of the word they recognize it they're looking at the word they know the junction they know the time they know the change they know the beast that's supposed to be in that hour Hallelujah they know the they know the time they know how it's supposed to go you see only the elect knows it hallelujah amen amen she recognized the dumb beat of change un God in human flesh she said come and see a man she just pointing to the flesh come and see a man she's identifying that this man in human flesh but is not this the Messiah in human flesh amen who told me all these things is not this the Christ the anointed one the word himself come and see Christ in human flesh why she was reading the music sheet she's reading the Bible she was listening to the symphony and she caught the change of the drum be of the word she recognized the coming of the Lord in her day and the priests and the scribes the Pharisees and the Sadducees they missed it they could not catch the drum bead of change amen she knew the sign of Messiah have we seen the sign of Messiah today yes the sign of Messiah of Des have seen a prophet with his back turned to the tent amen that could discern the audience and they could ask the question who is this MC now if this woman recognized the sign of Messiah what about us today yes that's reading God's music we are watching these signs we know something is happening in this day in this hour that we are living a Propet to turn around is back to the audience and then you would ask the question who is this m Jesus was in the storm with his disciples and they woke up Jesus in the storm and he said peace be still and they said what man of man is this that even the winds obey him now the elect is reading the music sheet and we' seen someone this day that could speak to a storm amen and a storm could come somebody is being introduced amen that is coming our hour we see the Creator do the same things that were done before 2,000 years ago the same God is doing the Greater Works today amen we are reading the music sheet of God's word PR 171 I'm going to close up with I'm trying to find a place to close up but I also don't want to leave out something that will bless our heart you love the Lord am amen okay I'm going to skip there's a drama in God's Symphony let's just close at this point here there's a throne in heaven one sits on the throne It's the Most Holy place and a voice cries out who is worthy to take the music sheet who is worthy to to take the symphony who is worthy to open the symphony who is worthy to even look upon this Sy Symphony and give the interpretation of the Symon and no man was worthy yes Revelation 5 John begins to weep bitterly but the Bible says Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah had prevailed amen other words the change of dispensation King David the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and he breaks out with a great Raw he is worthy to open the book He's Worthy to lose the seals and when John turned and looked he saw a lamb the meekness of a lamb the same one hiding in Simplicity again notice that before the lamb takes the book God hides in Simplicity of the Lamb then he opens the book The Prophet before he preaches a revelation of the seals he preaches God hid in Simplicity then he takes the book to preach the seals God hiding in simplicity so watching a symphony unfold yeah he takes the book and when he takes the book in Revelation 5 watch they break into worship suddenly the symphony is changing music is sounding they start to worship the four beast and 20 Elders they fall down before the lamb with sounds of Heart full of VES of ERS prayers of the Saints and they sing a new song when the lamb takes the book The simp opens up into a new scene there's worship that takes place then there's a scene change he leaves Heaven's throne and he's coming down to earth with the symphony Revelation chapter 8 the silence in the symphony a rest in the symphony an interval in the symphony the seven seal is open angels are worshiping God and whatever God is this worship but yet the prophet in the Bible says that In Heaven There was silence for the space of half an hour means Angels stopped worshiping what happen what's happening in the symphony whatever God is there worship but if Heaven is silent then God's not in heaven then God's left Heaven means he's coming down to earth and that's why when he comes down to earth there's noise on Earth again but Heaven is silent the says the Seven Seals the coming of the Lord in Souls that I Souls that are in prison now 63110 paragraph 347 say but remember all this time Noah was in the ark the bride is sealed in with Christ the last member has been redeemed the sick seal has produced his the seven seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him that said set down and claim what he own what he redeemed that's right it's always been that third pull three is perfection the ministry comes to his Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in the natural among human beings as predicted as it was in the days of L Pro say seven seal brings him back to earth when John takes that when the lamb takes that book remember there's silence in heaven for space half an hour he's left heaven but he's coming down to earth I want to drop something here you got think it's important to say and I want to lose the opportunity to say this here the reason for the silence in heaven because Heaven's Stone was empty if you read Revelation chapter 8 it says there was an angel with the golden sensor with much incense in his hands and what they do with the incense is they take the incense and they go into the most holy place and the and and it say when the high priest goes into the most holy place with the incense that the smoke of the incense creates a cloud and the cloud stands before the mercy seat and the priest himself and so you go with the incense and you go into the most holy place and a cloud has to appear in the most holy place and yet in Revelation chapter 8 it says the angel had the incense in his hands but he did not know what to do with the incense because there was silence in heaven and God was not there anymore the most holy place was not in heaven but the most holy Place had changed yes in Revelation 8 you find the Angel takes the incense and he throws it on Earth why does he throw it on Earth if it was meant to go in the most holy place because the most holy Place had changed was no more in heaven but now it was on Earth if you can picture way he through it I would say it like this year sunset Mountain 1963 the incense is strong strong and and the cloud appears why the most holy places changed from Heaven down to earth the Bible says Earth shook by an earthquake there was Thunders there was lightning a cloud forms itself on Mount Sunset there's a CH seene change in the symphony those who are watching the symphony they know that something is happening here on Earth amen the rest is a musical silence a rest in the music sheet but there's noise on Earth the scene has changed and brother preached a message what is the attraction on the mountain what is the noise all about he's asking a question because there's silence in heaven but there's an attraction on Earth there's silence in heaven but there's a noise on Earth those that are listening to it it's just a noise but those that are in the rhythm of the music sheet they know that this noise has a meaning amen and the director goes and say what is the noise all about it's a fulfillment of Revelation 10 verse 1 to7 Mighty angel coming down with an open book there's lightning there's earthquake there's Thunders down here on Earth something is taking place in God's Symphony of his word the bride is watching the symphony the change of the beat and she knows King David has come you love the Lord amen all is not over brothers and sisters the music sheet
