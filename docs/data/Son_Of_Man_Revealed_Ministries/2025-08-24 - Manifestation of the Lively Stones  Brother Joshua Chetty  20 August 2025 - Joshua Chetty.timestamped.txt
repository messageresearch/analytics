[0:00] your word, Lord, that you will come and
[0:01] speak to our souls. Now, we ask and
[0:03] commit the service into your name and
[0:06] under your mighty hand, oh God, in the
[0:07] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[0:09] Christ. Amen.
[0:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated a moment. I
[0:12] greet you all in the precious the holy
[0:14] name, the lovely name of our Lord and
[0:16] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. A lot of
[0:19] people are not here tonight. Amen.
[0:21] Unwell with the flu. Flu virus is going
[0:24] around. Amen. And remember Romesh called
[0:26] me earlier and he went to the doctor
[0:29] today with the flu. Amen. Brother Luke
[0:31] also unwell.
[0:33] I myself was unwell. I didn't go to work
[0:35] today. Amen. So still recovering from
[0:37] this flu. So amen. Take care of
[0:40] yourselves. Hydrate yourselves. And uh
[0:44] you've got one health, one life.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we need to be good stewards of
[0:49] this body. Hallelujah.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I see our brother Ravi here.
[0:53] Very good to see you. Let's give our
[0:55] brother Ravi a hand.
[0:57] Amen.
[0:59] It's been a while since we seen him, but
[1:02] Amen. I was talking to him a little
[1:03] while ago and he told me that he would
[1:05] come. Amen. So that's Matilda's father.
[1:08] Amen. So you know when he when he saw
[1:12] the revelation of baptism, uh I think it
[1:15] was a few years ago now, maybe 3 4
[1:17] years, then he wanted to get baptized.
[1:19] Amen. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:21] Christ. And I don't know if sister
[1:23] Matilda told you, but we had another
[1:24] brother come in on Sunday that brother
[1:26] Salvin was witnessing to. Amen. So we
[1:29] had to baptize him in the name of the
[1:30] Lord Jesus Christ. So we went out to the
[1:32] Stanmore swimming pool and we Amen.
[1:36] managed to get the brother baptized.
[1:38] Amen. So even as we said we are living
[1:40] in the last and final days of the
[1:43] Gentiles, the Lord will soon be turning
[1:45] his attention to the Jews.
[1:47] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know that right now,
[1:50] Amen. He's totally focused on the
[1:52] Gentiles.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. God don't walk with the two people
[1:56] at the same time.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So right now he's totally focused
[2:00] on the Gentiles.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. On us getting us ready. And if we
[2:05] only knew our importance in the body of
[2:07] Christ that Christ is depending on us to
[2:11] come to the full maturity of the word.
[2:13] Amen. Then we will understand our part
[2:15] in the body. Hallelujah. So sometimes
[2:18] what we need to do if we can't overcome
[2:21] the things of this life if we don't
[2:22] overcome ourselves
[2:24] &gt;&gt; sometimes we need to get over ourselves.
[2:26] Amen. And get over the things of
[2:29] ourselves our own carnal natures. And if
[2:31] you find ourselves slipping or maybe
[2:33] even you find yourself getting caught up
[2:36] in things of the world, slipping with
[2:37] the things of the world, ask yourself
[2:39] what are you feeding yourself with?
[2:42] &gt;&gt; There's definitely a lack of nutrition
[2:45] somewhere.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we're not feeding on the
[2:48] word and on the things of God and we're
[2:50] not supplementing that word by prayer,
[2:52] then we're going to find ourselves in
[2:54] the flesh in carnality.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; And that's where we don't want to find
[2:57] ourselves in this time and season
[2:59] because God is pouring out his spirit in
[3:01] his people through his people. Amen. So
[3:05] I ask you to remember these believers in
[3:07] prayer that are not here. Amen. That the
[3:08] Lord will strengthen them, touch them.
[3:10] Amen. Also pray for brother Dixon and
[3:12] his family. Uh they were Amen. and they
[3:16] were last year in church 3 weeks ago.
[3:18] And uh I'll just share this with you so
[3:20] that you can remember the family. They
[3:22] were thrown into a situation when they
[3:24] went back home. And
[3:27] so when they got back home, their son
[3:29] Jared, you know Jared that grew up in
[3:31] the church and then he backslid. So he
[3:34] was waiting at the door with a bush
[3:35] knife and a knife for his father. So he
[3:38] basically chased them away from the
[3:39] house. He's now staying there with his
[3:41] family, with his wife. Uh so you know
[3:44] it's not they they haven't been back
[3:46] home for the last 3 weeks now. So
[3:48] they've been staying with the son.
[3:49] Sister Dave was is in Johannesburg.
[3:51] She's coming back tomorrow. This is how
[3:53] the devil works. Amen. Sometimes you'll
[3:56] raise somebody in the house to cause a
[3:58] problem and now their life is dis
[4:01] disrupted. I mean these are pensioners
[4:03] and they need their home. So I want you
[4:06] to commit this family in prayer. Amen.
[4:08] That that demon power that's raised up
[4:10] in the brother Amen. will leave.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there'll be some resolution in
[4:15] the family. So they haven't come to
[4:18] church. Amen. Because of that. And they
[4:20] call me to tell me this. Amen. So I want
[4:22] you I'm not telling you this for gossip.
[4:24] Neither am I telling you for
[4:25] entertainment. I'm telling you because
[4:28] they are part of the body and I'm asking
[4:30] you to pray.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That the Lord will intervene. So
[4:33] we've seen tremendous testimony today.
[4:35] even uh you know pastor Moses Jova from
[4:39] Zimbabwe call me and the first question
[4:42] he asked me is how's the angel of the
[4:44] lord
[4:46] you know and I told him well he's fine
[4:48] he's doing just fine you know we're
[4:50] getting test getting testimonies daily
[4:54] and he says yes tell me about it I said
[4:55] brother you know I I can't share all the
[4:58] testimonies with you because this is not
[4:59] to promote a ministry I said this is how
[5:03] the lord is working in the lives of the
[5:04] individuals
[5:06] I said the ministry is here to equip the
[5:08] believers and they themselves are seeing
[5:10] the testimonies. So I said we have life
[5:12] testimonies. We have testimonies of
[5:14] healing people's personal problems,
[5:16] people's personal Amen. situations in
[5:18] their lives. Yes. Speaking the word and
[5:20] believing it and it is coming to pass.
[5:22] Amen. And you'll see many testimonies.
[5:26] Even sister J was sharing a testimony.
[5:28] Amen. If you saw in the group, she put a
[5:30] testimony or a prayer request for sister
[5:33] Pam.
[5:34] Amen. How many of you saw that?
[5:37] &gt;&gt; And if you prayed, Amen. So the Lord has
[5:39] touched her and whatever she was
[5:42] experiencing is totally gone.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:47] So even the sister who couldn't explain
[5:48] it and we know it's a supernatural touch
[5:51] of the Lord and I was telling sister J
[5:53] in the car on the way here. Sometimes
[5:54] it's a simple act of faith cuz none of
[5:57] us would have known about a sister's
[5:59] testimony or prayer request if she
[6:01] didn't believe by faith and put the
[6:03] prayer request on the group. So it was a
[6:05] simple act of faith. The believers pray
[6:07] and the Lord answered prayer.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we thank the Lord for that that
[6:12] we can see his mighty hand, his healing
[6:14] power even in these situations that we
[6:17] go through in life. So I encourage you
[6:20] to put God first and still believe him
[6:22] that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[6:24] forever. Amen. This evening, we'll be
[6:26] ministered to by our brother Joshua.
[6:28] Amen. So let's stand together even as he
[6:30] comes. Share the word of the Lord.
[6:33] Amen. You believe in your heart that the
[6:35] Lord will speak to you tonight and the
[6:37] Lord will meet you at the point of your
[6:38] need. Amen.
[6:43] Sing, I've come expecting Jesus.

[11:19] God. Amen. God bless you, brother Ravi.
[11:21] Good to see you. God bless every one of
[11:23] you.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; We got our Bibles. You turn to the book
[11:29] of one Peter.
[11:32] You know the enemy has come to steal and
[11:34] destroy.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said he has come to give
[11:36] life and give it more abundantly.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil comes to put inflictions
[11:41] upon our bodies.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Because he know he got nothing to do
[11:44] with the soul. He can't touch our souls.
[11:46] Amen.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; So he come to try and afflict us in
[11:49] every way possible. But we thank God
[11:51] that we have rightful claims
[11:53] &gt;&gt; to every redemptive blessing and to
[11:55] every promise in the word of God. Amen.
[11:57] Amen.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; And we know that we want our bodies to
[12:00] serve God.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; We are placed on the third for a purpose
[12:03] and our purpose is to serve the father.
[12:05] Amen.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; And to be about his business.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; And as long as he's got a work for us.
[12:12] Amen. Then he has to keep us. Amen.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 2:4
[12:19] 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 4 and 5.
[12:23] to whom coming is unto a living stone,
[12:28] disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of
[12:31] God and precious.
[12:34] Yay also as lively stones.
[12:39] Praise God.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Lively stones.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Not dead stones. Amen. People that have
[12:46] life in them, not just any life, but the
[12:49] life of God in them are built up a
[12:53] spiritual house
[12:55] &gt;&gt; and holy priesthood to offer up
[12:58] spiritual sacrifices.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
[13:05] Wherefore also it is contained in the
[13:08] scripture, behold I lay in Zion a chief
[13:12] cornerstone,
[13:13] elect precious, and he that believeth on
[13:16] him shall not be confounded. Unto you
[13:20] therefore which believe is precious.
[13:24] But unto them which be disobedient, the
[13:27] stone which the bullers disallowed, the
[13:30] same is made the head of the corner.
[13:33] Amen.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; And a stone of stumbling and a rock of
[13:38] offense, even to them would stumble at
[13:41] the word,
[13:42] being disobedient,
[13:44] where onto also they were appointed. But
[13:48] ye are a chosen generation.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; A royal priesthood
[13:54] &gt;&gt; and holy nation, a peculiar people, that
[13:58] ye should show forth the praises of him
[14:01] who had called you out of darkness into
[14:05] his marvelous light.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Just uh one more scripture before we be
[14:10] seated. Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11.
[14:14] And he gave some apostles and some
[14:17] prophets and some evangelists, some
[14:20] pastors and teachers
[14:23] &gt;&gt; for a purpose for the perfecting of the
[14:26] saints.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; For the work of the ministry, for the
[14:30] edifying of the body of Christ.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; So there's a purpose. Amen. Till we all
[14:38] come in the unity of the faith and of
[14:42] the knowledge of the son of God unto a
[14:45] perfect man and to the measure of the
[14:49] stature of the fullness of Christ. How
[14:52] are you going to come to the a perfect
[14:55] man and to the knowledge of the son of
[14:57] God? Through the five-fold ministry.
[15:00] Amen.
[15:02] that we endort be no more children
[15:05] tossed to and fro carried about with
[15:08] every wind of doctrine
[15:10] by the slate of men and cunning
[15:13] craftiness whereby they lie in way to
[15:15] deceive but speaking the truth in love
[15:19] may grow up into him in all things which
[15:23] is the head even Christ from whom the
[15:26] whole body fitly joined together and
[15:29] compacted by that which every joint
[15:33] supply according to the effectual
[15:35] working in the measure of every part
[15:38] make it increase of the body into the
[15:41] unto the edifying of itself in love.
[15:44] Amen. You may be seated.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[15:52] we know that Christ himself
[15:55] was the living stone rejected of men but
[15:57] chosen of God.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. But we as the bride are lively
[16:01] stones cut from the same rock.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Quickened by the same life.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; So we know
[16:13] this is not a theory we're talking about
[16:16] now.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; We just read something in in written
[16:19] form. But this is an hour and this is a
[16:23] season where what the word we read about
[16:26] now there must be a manifestation of
[16:28] that.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a season an hour of the
[16:33] manifestation of the lively stones.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; These are not stones that that coming
[16:41] that stuck in later sea in amongst the
[16:44] denomination cold and formal.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; These are not stillborn stones. M
[16:50] &gt;&gt; these stones have life in them.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; And it is the life of the head.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this life is eternal life.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; This life is supernatural life.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; This life is divine life.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we are made partakers
[17:08] of his divine nature.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And his divine characteristics
[17:14] &gt;&gt; must be manifested in us.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. If we have received him who have
[17:20] who the one that was the cornerstone
[17:22] which was rejected and now become the
[17:24] headstone. If we have received him the
[17:27] head then his divine characteristics his
[17:30] very attributes must be manifested in
[17:33] and through us.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; So we just want to speak on a little
[17:38] title the manifestation of the lively
[17:41] stones.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Christ himself is the living
[17:45] stone.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Because if it wasn't if he's
[17:49] not the living stone, then how do we get
[17:50] that life? How do we be that life
[17:52] stones?
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Because we are cut out of him. Amen.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; We are part of him.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so if he was rejected of men
[18:04] because of who he was, he was the word.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word was rejected.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; So this true word in its true form must
[18:12] be rejected.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; By men of the world. Yes.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; But not sons and daughters of God.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Those that are part of God don't go away
[18:21] in the fors of God. All will come to the
[18:24] knowledge of the truth.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; All will come and be attracted to the
[18:28] true and living words.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; We don't want a word of history. We
[18:33] don't want a a word of another day. We
[18:35] don't want a a word that died out. It's
[18:38] day or it's time because mana came for a
[18:41] certain time and died out. But we are
[18:43] called to come up higher.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Into the shikina glory.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And come into the most holy place
[18:50] &gt;&gt; where the word for heaven liveth. Amen.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Where the mana is always fresh.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; So we know every stone had to be hooed
[19:03] and measured and set in place without
[19:05] the sound of a hammer. That was when he
[19:07] was building the temple. Amen. So just
[19:10] like that
[19:12] we had to be formed and and come into
[19:14] the place he had to bring us in. It
[19:18] wasn't the work of man bringing us in.
[19:20] Amen. It was the divine work of God
[19:23] bringing us in.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; And no matter what form he was coming,
[19:27] whatever form it was, he had to he had
[19:30] to hoon us out. Amen.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a work. In other words, it's
[19:35] not a man's work.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural work. Amen.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Each one of us that are sitting here
[19:41] tonight can testify that we are here
[19:44] because we have been supernaturally
[19:46] called into this marvelous light to
[19:48] believe the word of God in this hour. No
[19:51] man has called us. He didn't take our
[19:53] own intellect and to make us realize
[19:56] that God sent a word to prepare us for
[19:58] the rapture.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Because this message has come to give us
[20:02] rapturing faith.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; This message has come to connect us
[20:06] &gt;&gt; with Christ himself. Amen. Amen.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; Come to connect us with the stone.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; So we know there was life stone from the
[20:17] past ages
[20:19] which which formed the body of the
[20:21] pyramid. Amen.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; So we know there've been seven church
[20:24] ages and in every age they were lively
[20:27] stones. Yes. God took called them out in
[20:30] the age set them apart and then they
[20:32] were packed away and then another age
[20:34] set in one age after the other. Amen. M
[20:37] &gt;&gt; it was like the baton was just being
[20:38] passed on.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. But in this age, Amen. This in the
[20:44] final age, Amen.
[20:46] This this is the age where it had to
[20:49] come now where the the stone was fitly
[20:53] framed together in such a way that now
[20:55] the headstone could come down because
[20:57] this is the age where he comes into
[20:59] union.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; In no other age he could come in for
[21:02] into a marriage. Amen.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But in this age, he comes into a
[21:06] marriage union.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; The invisible union. Amen. Of the
[21:10] heavenly bridegroom with the earthly
[21:13] bride.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; No other age but in this age.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; It wasn't why it's an invisible union.
[21:21] It wasn't seen to the eyes of the world.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't seen to the church world.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; But it was an invisible union. For God's
[21:28] elected,
[21:29] &gt;&gt; for God selected few. Amen.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Those that were part of him.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Those were cut off from the same rock.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's come in this age that
[21:43] there are to be a connection. Amen. Not
[21:45] in any other age. In this age, there are
[21:48] to be this union.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when at the when the bride
[21:56] had to be honed. Amen.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. And I think could we get to the
[22:01] quote that pastor Adrian read out?
[22:03] That's a lovely quote that the way the
[22:06] prophet brings it out there in the
[22:08] stature of a perfect man. Amen.
[22:11] He says,
[22:13] "And this church, you see, is coming
[22:16] smaller in the minority."
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. You look at the pyramid
[22:25] from the the way it was, but now it's
[22:26] coming smaller. Amen.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; So this is not going to be a mass group.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God don't work in masses.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God worked with
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; special class of people.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. With an elite class of people.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Did he said to Elijah, "I have reserved
[22:49] for me 7,000."
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God always worked with the
[22:54] minority.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; Didn't Gideon a mighty man of valor when
[22:57] the angel appeared to him. Amen. And he
[22:59] was selected army and then he bring them
[23:02] to so many thousand and then he bring it
[23:04] down till even he come to 300. And God
[23:07] will now work with a minority. Amen.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; And God has always been doing that.
[23:14] Amen.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; God don't look at the masses. God comes
[23:18] for his own.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:21] And this church you see is coming
[23:23] smaller in the minority.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; It's a whole lot sharper than that.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; But just like to write, you see what
[23:32] he's saying? It's coming even smaller.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; To the final part of it. And this is the
[23:37] climax of it now where it's come even
[23:39] smaller now. Amen. Amen.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Because even in in people that even you
[23:45] thought was in the message, they're
[23:47] drifting away or they dominating around
[23:49] manmade teachings.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Not staying with the true word. Amen.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Not staying with the guy that's here.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; It's the angel of God that is leading
[23:57] the church.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; The mighty angel that is here amongst
[24:00] us. You've got to follow the angel. In
[24:03] every Exodus, it's the angel of God that
[24:05] is leading. Amen. And this in this
[24:07] Exodus, it's still the angel of God that
[24:09] is leading the church. Amen.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; And if you've got to follow the angel of
[24:12] God, Amen. you've got to be sensitive to
[24:15] the move of the spirit. Amen.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; And when you're sensitive to the move of
[24:20] the spirit, then he's going to take you
[24:22] into unknown territory. He's going to
[24:24] take you to higher dimensions. Amen.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Because why? You are getting you are
[24:30] drawing from heavenly places.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; You can if you want to draw from
[24:35] intellect, you can do that. If you want
[24:37] to draw from theology, you can make
[24:38] theology around his message. In fact, in
[24:41] this message, you can write a complete
[24:42] thesis, a doctorate on it.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; There's so much of word in it. But the
[24:47] Holy Spirit only works in simplicity.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural message. Don't
[24:53] take a message that comes from another
[24:56] dimension, a message that comes, a
[24:59] mighty angel comes down with his
[25:00] message. Amen. from another dimension,
[25:02] from another world, and brings this
[25:04] message to this earthly dimension. Don't
[25:06] try to take this message and mix it with
[25:08] earthly teachings.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; We was already delivered from that.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; We was already called out of the church.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; We don't take the traditions of men.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; The traditions of men take you and teach
[25:21] you in a certain way.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; They take the Bible and they teach the
[25:25] Bible in a certain way.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; We were delivered from the traditions of
[25:28] men. Yes. Amen.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; We were called up to come up higher.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are now in soaring in heavenly
[25:36] places.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Only where heavenly creatures can saw.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Earthly creatures cannot come
[25:42] there.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to be an heavenly creature, it
[25:47] means you're always there to be that.
[25:49] Amen.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; It is your makeup.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So this church you see
[25:57] is coming smaller in the minority.
[25:59] It's a whole lot sharper than that. But
[26:02] just like to write that cross there, see
[26:04] it's come up to a needle point.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Until the church in the minority has got
[26:10] to get into a place and until it's the
[26:15] same kind.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. of a ministry
[26:20] that this left because when this
[26:22] headstone comes back and we know he's
[26:24] already back.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; This is when this is now he's speaking
[26:27] about something to come. Amen.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; But it's here. Amen.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; It's got a little pocket like here where
[26:35] it's going to sit right in there on the
[26:37] regular pyramids.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; It's just a cap that sits across the
[26:42] top. It's like a flange. And pastor
[26:45] Adrian gave you the the meaning of that.
[26:47] It comes from the word rib as well.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; And it's got to sit on there cuz it
[26:52] sheds the water.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; And when it come the church has got to
[26:58] be honed.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; All rest the stones in the pyramid are
[27:05] laying so perfect till you can run a
[27:09] razor blade between them weighing tons
[27:12] laying in there. How they got them up
[27:14] they don't know. But they were built
[27:16] &gt;&gt; and up here when the pyramid cap does
[27:19] come itself the body of Christ will have
[27:22] to be horned. How we got here the world
[27:24] don't know.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; How we got to believe this message the
[27:28] world don't know.

[27:34] areas.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Different tribes to the jungles
[27:39] &gt;&gt; into every nation and tribe.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; How this message went there? the world
[27:43] don't know.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; But it's the work of the Holy Ghost.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the angel of God that's
[27:50] fixing things.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Getting his people ready to leave this
[27:54] dimension, to leave this earth. Amen.
[27:57] This message comes so we can have enough
[27:59] ingredients to give us a body change.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; To change this vile bodies. Amen. Into
[28:05] supernatural bodies. Amen.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.

[28:13] And he up here when the pyramid cap does
[28:15] come the pyramid itself the body of
[28:17] Christ will have to be horned not only
[28:20] just some creed or doctrine or something
[28:24] other we come through it will have to be
[28:26] so perfectly
[28:27] &gt;&gt; yes
[28:28] &gt;&gt; like Christ

[29:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; And Christ was all the word. So we must
[29:09] be all the word.
[29:20] So you see when the church comes to

[30:37] of God. Amen.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[31:07] &gt;&gt; So only when you're coming up under the
[31:09] headstone. Amen.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Then you've got the revelation of the
[31:12] word.

[31:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; You've got to come. And this couldn't
[31:19] this coming of the headstone is
[31:21] Revelation 10:1.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because Christ himself shall
[31:24] descend from heaven with a shout.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; With a voice of the archangel, with the
[31:29] trump of God. Amen.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; He's doing all three things as is
[31:34] descending.

[31:37] &gt;&gt; The shout is so powerful when you
[31:40] thought you was insignificant in this
[31:42] world.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; The shout is so powerful when you
[31:45] thought that you are nothing in this
[31:48] world. You are just an ordinary citizen
[31:50] of this country. The shout came to show
[31:53] you who you truly are.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; It come to show you that you come from
[31:57] God. You go back to God.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; It come to show you that you're part of
[32:00] him
[32:01] &gt;&gt; because it comes with a quickening
[32:03] power.

[32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the shout comes, it
[32:08] wasn't received by then by the church
[32:11] world.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Miracles were received by them.
[32:14] Signs and wonders was received by them.
[32:16] A wicked and adulterous generation
[32:18] secret after signs.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; But signs and wonders followed them.
[32:21] that believe.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; It follows the believer. We don't seek
[32:25] after it. Amen.

[32:27] &gt;&gt; Testimonies will follow you. You don't
[32:29] seek after that. Amen.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; But we come to oneness with him. Amen.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; We want to be in such a union with him.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; That we want to just every when people
[32:40] look at us, we just want them to see
[32:41] Christ in us.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[32:46] Amen.
[32:48] So we find that lively stones are not
[32:51] bound to the dust of Leysia.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; They're not bound to the things of this
[32:54] world. They're not bound to creeds and
[32:56] dogmas because they are eagles.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[33:00] &gt;&gt; they are soaring in heavenly places.
[33:02] Amen.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:6 says, "And raised us up
[33:07] together
[33:08] &gt;&gt; and made us sit together."
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Together. Amen.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Are we not separated body? Amen. Amen.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Those that are part of this must be
[33:16] together.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We must be of one mind of one
[33:21] accord.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Because it's not a man-made thing. Amen.
[33:25] My my work here, your work there. No, we
[33:27] are working for the body of Christ in
[33:30] one body. Amen.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; So he made us sit to gather in heavenly
[33:36] places in Christ Jesus.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. that in the ages to come he might
[33:43] show the exceeding riches of his grace
[33:45] in his kindness towards us through
[33:47] Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved
[33:50] through faith and that not of yourself.
[33:52] It is the gift of God.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Not of works lest any man should boast.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; For we are his workmanship created in
[34:01] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[34:04] had before orained that we should walk
[34:06] in them. So we know what leia produced
[34:10] cold lifeless stones.
[34:13] That's what he's producing out there.
[34:15] You see big churches, mega churches and
[34:17] so forth, but lifeless.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; You think they're rich n but they're
[34:22] naked and nobody not. They're poor,
[34:24] miserable, blind.
[34:27] They're in such a bad condition that
[34:28] they don't know it. It's better that
[34:30] they know they're a sinner
[34:31] &gt;&gt; than not know it.
[34:34] On the day of judgment, the prostitute
[34:36] knows where she is.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; The drunkard know who he is.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; But the man that's thinking now I've
[34:42] done I I was serving God. I was going to
[34:46] church and I had religion. That's the
[34:48] problem.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; But thank God we are passed from death
[34:56] unto life.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are being judged to the word
[35:00] right now.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes,
[35:02] &gt;&gt; we are being corrected to the word right
[35:03] now because we are the the word comes
[35:06] with a transforming power
[35:08] &gt;&gt; that we'll be we'll no longer conform to
[35:11] the pattern of this world.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; But the word comes so we can be
[35:15] transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Why? Our mind is renewed. The mind of
[35:20] Christ has come down.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; That we say no, we no longer we we are
[35:25] now under your headship, oh Lord.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; We come under submission to you. Amen.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you speak, we will follow.
[35:34] Amen.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; So you find that this bride although
[35:40] they are lifeless, they are cold, but
[35:43] this bride must be a living manifesting
[35:47] Christ right now.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; A living manifestation of Christ now.
[35:51] Amen.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; So what is it? What is this
[35:57] manifestation of the life we're talking
[35:59] about?
[36:00] It's a reproduction of Christ.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; In a many membered body.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is what? The continuation of
[36:09] the word made flesh.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; That's what it simply is.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; It is Christ being manifested in a many
[36:17] membered body. It's reproducing him.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; It's completely reproducing him.
[36:22] Therefore, now you are being fruitful
[36:25] and you are multiplying.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are reproducing Christ
[36:30] again in a many membered body and you
[36:33] are continuing by the word being made
[36:36] flesh again.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Is not the word made flesh in one person
[36:42] now. It's one man. No, it's a many
[36:45] membered body.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:50] So in this union, Amen.
[36:53] we've received the revelation of the
[36:55] word. Amen.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:57] And the revelation takes us into the
[37:00] king's chamber. Amen.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; It bring it is revelation that brings us
[37:04] by the door into the king's chamber.
[37:06] Amen.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; It brings us into intimacy.
[37:10] And when he brings us there because we
[37:12] already know what the king wants. We
[37:14] already know his everything about him.
[37:16] Amen. We've already learn heard
[37:18] everything about him and what he wants,
[37:21] what he desires. Amen. So we've come
[37:23] into full submission to him.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just like in the story of
[37:28] Esther. Amen. How she was brought there.
[37:30] Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; And she was brought there to the
[37:35] chamberlain. Amen. Into the king's
[37:36] chamber, directed there. And then then
[37:38] they say, right,
[37:40] &gt;&gt; he was she was taught what to do. And
[37:42] then he leaves her right there. And then
[37:44] it's a private affair.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Because they must come. That's what the
[37:48] fible ministry is doing. It's connecting
[37:50] you with him.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; And when you come to him, that is
[37:54] between you and God. Amen.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; That no pastor, no evangelist, no
[37:59] teacher, no prophet can give you that
[38:01] that that personal relationship.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; You've got to have that connection
[38:06] yourself with God.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; You've got to have that intimate
[38:09] relationship with Christ himself.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Therefore, when you're praying
[38:14] when you when you pray for a need, you
[38:16] don't pray as if you're disconnected
[38:18] from him.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; You've got to have relationship with
[38:21] him.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to have a relationship, it
[38:24] means you must you you must uh you you
[38:27] you must be familiar with him.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; You must be spending time with him.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, there's no bond there.
[38:35] Now, you know, if somebody has a
[38:37] relationship, if they don't spend time
[38:38] together, there's no bond between them.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine you're not spending
[38:44] time with Christ, you don't have you
[38:46] don't read your Bible, you don't pray or
[38:47] you there's no personal time with him.
[38:49] Leave your time when you're coming to
[38:50] church and meeting people. Come with
[38:52] your private time, your own relationship
[38:54] with Christ. If you don't have that, you
[38:56] don't have a bond with him.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; So when you pray,
[39:00] you find that your prayer is so
[39:02] disconnected from him
[39:04] &gt;&gt; because there's no relationship there.
[39:05] But when you have a relationship with
[39:07] him, when you're praying, you know that
[39:09] you're speaking directly to him.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; So that's what the five ministry is
[39:15] placing you in all these things is is is
[39:17] placing you in your connection with him.
[39:19] The word has come to connect you with
[39:20] him.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:25] So you find that when you have this
[39:27] connection with him now, it's an
[39:28] intimacy. Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; And this union must produce fruit.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Not stillborns, not creeds, but
[39:37] manifested sons and daughters of God.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Because why? She's impregnated with his
[39:45] seed. When you come to union, you get
[39:46] impregnated with his seed.
[39:49] And then what you do, you're producing
[39:50] his very life.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Not in not not talking about a life that
[39:55] he wants to produce in this day. Amen.
[39:58] Not speaking about another man's uh
[40:01] &gt;&gt; another man's history or another man's
[40:03] testimony, your own testimony in this
[40:05] day. Amen.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; So we find that God's spiritual temple.
[40:11] Amen. It has now come. It's now come to
[40:14] a completion. Amen.
[40:16] There's no other age.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; The headstone has come down. The fact
[40:21] that the headstone has come down,
[40:23] there's no other age.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[40:25] &gt;&gt; it means the temple is completed.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Because if the temple wasn't completed,
[40:30] he wouldn't come to connect with it.
[40:32] Amen. But he comes now to come to give
[40:35] to the Holy Ghost can come and dwell in
[40:37] us. Where now he got a place to a
[40:40] spiritual house to dwell in. He got a
[40:43] spiritual house where he can now move
[40:45] through a people. He can now he got a
[40:47] people that must be surrendered to him
[40:50] &gt;&gt; so much healed to him submitted to him
[40:52] the words.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; That now he can work through you.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; He can direct you. He can guide you.
[40:59] Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Right now the world is moving so fast.
[41:05] man's agenda. The pastor Adrian just
[41:08] mentioned in the briefly in the
[41:09] beginning that about what's happening in
[41:12] right now that God don't work with the
[41:14] gentile and the Jews simultaneously
[41:16] which is correct because right now among
[41:20] in the gentile world which is closing up
[41:22] now this is a winding up time. Um have
[41:26] you ever seen in the history of any US
[41:31] president
[41:33] so much things are happening so rapidly
[41:35] &gt;&gt; so many meetings with so many world
[41:38] powers
[41:40] so rapidly
[41:42] &gt;&gt; all is not happening for nothing.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Things are winding up.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; So if things are happening rapidly like
[41:49] that you think the holy the angel of God
[41:50] is not fixing things.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; He's fixing things all over. Amen.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. is going to bring you in rapidly.
[41:56] Amen. He's going to bring you up to
[41:58] pace.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; With his agenda. Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Because why? Eventually the gospel must
[42:05] go back to the Jews.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; We don't have much time left. The time
[42:10] that we've got left now, we just waiting
[42:13] for that last few to come up now.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; To come up into the headstone.
[42:20] So we're not talking about a theory.
[42:23] Amen. Because this is the complete
[42:27] completion of the temple where Christ is
[42:29] fully expressed in his body.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; You know that was Christ the mercy of
[42:33] God revealed. Amen. Where all that was
[42:35] in God he poured into Christ. All that
[42:38] was in Christ he poured into his church.
[42:40] Christ must be fully expressed through
[42:43] you and I. Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Ephesians 2:20 and 22 says,
[42:48] "And are built upon the foundation of
[42:51] the apostles and prophets,
[42:53] Jesus Christ himself being the chief
[42:55] cornerstone in whom all the building
[42:58] fitly framed together grow into an holy
[43:00] temple in the Lord."
[43:03] So this manifestation now of all the
[43:06] lively stones is the completion of this
[43:08] temple and Christ is fully expressed.
[43:11] Now this is not a theory.
[43:14] Amen. This is not some just some
[43:16] teaching or something. It's an actual
[43:18] thing.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And and God is the one that's bringing
[43:23] it up to speed.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; You know, we could have we could have
[43:28] wondered how is people going to be
[43:30] brought up to speed to come up to now
[43:32] into that level.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; God is the one.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; He's here. Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; He's the one that bringing the people up
[43:39] to speed.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; But through the five-fold ministry.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, this is not a gospel
[43:45] where you can just take it and say, "I
[43:46] will just sit at home and I will read it
[43:48] for myself and I will hear from the Lord
[43:51] myself."
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Then we out of scripture.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; We're out of the word. Amen.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; We've got to conform to the word. Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; So,
[44:03] this is not a theory, but it's a
[44:04] manifestation. Signs and wonders,
[44:07] character, and divine nature, the divine
[44:10] nature of Christ flowing through this
[44:12] body. Yes.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Signs and wonders are following the
[44:16] believers.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; People are looking for sign, but it's
[44:19] happening.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; It's happening. Amen.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; But it's happening behind closed doors.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Because it's not a public show.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; And the character of the believers is
[44:28] such they're not going to make they're
[44:30] not going to put a big thing about it
[44:32] &gt;&gt; because it's just part of the nature.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; The supernatural is is part of the
[44:36] nature.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Experiencing the supernatural is
[44:40] part of the nature.
[44:42] This is not some denomination when when
[44:44] some small thing happen they make a big
[44:46] thing out of it
[44:48] &gt;&gt; as if it's a circus or some show.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; This is not a show. Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; We are just living out the word.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; We are just living out our part of the
[44:58] word.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; That's what makes us walk in perfect
[45:01] faith. Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:07] He says if you go to the set of the
[45:10] perfect man paragraph 360
[45:14] he says so when you surrender
[45:18] paragraph 360
[45:31] I'll just wait for
[45:43] Amen. So he says, "So when you surrender
[45:47] your complete being, then the Holy
[45:50] Spirit just pours through you."
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; In these virtues, then you a living
[45:56] tabernacle.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Then people look out and say, "That's a
[46:01] man full of virtue, knowledge. He
[46:04] believes the word, temperance, patience,
[46:06] godliness, brotherly kindness, full of
[46:09] the love of the Holy Ghost." See there
[46:11] he's walking around. What is it? a
[46:14] stature that unbelievers can look at and
[46:16] say there is a Christian. There is a man
[46:19] or a woman who knows what they're
[46:21] talking about.
[46:23] You never seen a kinder, sweeter,
[46:26] godlier person. You're sealed. A seal
[46:29] shows on both sides. Whether you're
[46:31] going or coming, you see the seal just
[46:33] the same. There you are. See, when a man
[46:36] or woman possess this, then the capstone
[46:39] comes down and seals them into the
[46:41] kingdom of God, which is the Holy Ghost.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Then the word coming from here manifest
[46:49] itself
[46:51] &gt;&gt; through each one of these beings.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; See, and make this complete being, a
[46:56] tabernacle of the living God, a working
[47:00] living example of Christianity.
[47:03] What Christ was, these people are.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Because his life is in here. They are in
[47:11] Christ and their life is dead and hidden
[47:15] Christ through God and sealed in there
[47:17] by the Holy Ghost.
[47:20] 1 Corinthians 12. That's right. You
[47:22] reckon yourself dead. Then you're born
[47:24] of faith. Then virtue and these other
[47:27] things is added to you till you are a
[47:29] perfect living image of God.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; That's why the world will be confounded
[47:37] because there might have been critics
[47:40] about this message. Critics of why this
[47:43] people believe say there was a certain
[47:45] prophet who says that he came with a
[47:48] message of God.
[47:50] They might have criticized that through
[47:51] the years and all his ages. But the
[47:54] vindication that he kept packed with a
[47:57] message from God.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; That seven angels came from another
[48:01] world.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; That come with a message. Angels packed
[48:05] this message. Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; The vindication of that is a people on
[48:10] the earth coming into the image of
[48:13] Christ.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. For no theology, no man-made
[48:17] teaching will bring anybody on the
[48:19] earth, any human being on the earth into
[48:21] the image of Christ, but a message that
[48:24] comes directly from God.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. A message that come from the
[48:29] throne room of God.
[48:31] Because what was lost in the garden of
[48:33] Eden, the title that Adam and Eve, Adam
[48:36] lost, has come down in this day into the
[48:39] rightful owners again. Amen. Yes.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; And the very spirit that Adam had, the
[48:43] true spirit that he lost out there, the
[48:45] Holy Ghost has come back upon the
[48:47] believer.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It why now the Holy Ghost now
[48:53] people speak they think by manifesting
[48:57] gifts of the Holy Ghost they have the
[48:59] Holy Ghost.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; But give them the word test.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; And see if they believe the word. They
[49:04] say yes we believe the word. All right.
[49:06] Fine. See if that word remains fresh.
[49:08] Because when you got the Holy Ghost
[49:10] himself, the person of the Holy Ghost,
[49:12] the manner must be fresh all the time.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; You won't be eating word of another day.
[49:17] Amen. You won't be speaking about a
[49:19] stale word. You will understand your
[49:21] word in this time and season.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. And you'll move with
[49:28] the agenda of God
[49:30] because sons and daughters of God must
[49:32] be about the father's business.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:40] We know in the story of Esther, she was
[49:42] prepared.
[49:44] Her first time that she had to be with
[49:45] the king, the f the first time for the
[49:48] king to encounter her, she had to be
[49:49] prepared first. Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Oils, perfumes, and garments given by
[49:53] the king's chamberlain,

[53:10] &gt;&gt; and espe especially the you sons and
[53:12] daughters of God. He's concerned about
[53:14] you in every Don't think you can go and
[53:17] shed a tear without God knowing about
[53:19] it.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Don't think you cry in silence.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Don't think you go with your worry and
[53:24] doubt. He doesn't know about it.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Cast your cares upon him for he cared
[53:28] for you.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; But in his hour, you got to be certain
[53:31] about God.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; And in his hour, you got to be connected
[53:33] with him. That when you pray, you're not
[53:36] praying to a distant person. You are
[53:37] praying to someone you have a
[53:39] relationship with you, someone that you
[53:40] bonded with.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Some other quotes.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; In the message, Jesus keeps all his
[53:53] appointment. It says, "And the capstone
[53:55] that goes upon the pyramid, it was
[53:57] rejected. It was never on the pyramid.
[53:59] Isn't until this day.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; The stone of stone, they claim, the
[54:05] stone of scone, they claim, but it never
[54:07] was put on. They kept stone. Why? When
[54:11] Enoch and them in the early days build a
[54:13] pyramid down in Egypt, we find out and
[54:16] in there they knew that the cornerstone,
[54:18] the capstone would be rejected and that
[54:21] pyramid is put so perfectly together
[54:23] till they don't need mortar. It was so
[54:26] mechanically hooed out until one stone
[54:29] fits against the other one. So tight you
[54:32] can't even put a razor blade between
[54:33] them. Now just keep heaping up and now
[54:36] it's all owned off on top ready for the
[54:39] capstone when it will come. That's the
[54:42] way God has brought his church from
[54:44] justification, sanctification, baptism
[54:46] of the Holy Spirit. And now the ministry
[54:48] of the spirit which is what quickens the
[54:52] word that ministry in the church will
[54:56] have to be just exactly like he is.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So no way it can be anyhow any
[55:04] other way. It's got to be exactly
[55:07] manifesting him. Amen.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; His very image.
[55:13] He says in the message the future home
[55:16] of the heavenly bridegroom and earthly
[55:17] bride. He says now notice how beautiful.
[55:19] And in this pyramid we see seven steps
[55:22] and then the king's chamber. And we're
[55:25] in the seven church age before the king
[55:28] takes his throne. So you see what he's
[55:30] saying? You got to recognize when he
[55:32] when he's speaking and what year he's
[55:34] speaking it. Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Before the king takes his throne.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; So if that was a seven church age then
[55:40] as a seven church age but now we've come
[55:43] now to the headstone because before he's
[55:45] crowned we it is a bride that will crown
[55:48] him. Amen.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; It's the queen that's going to crown
[55:51] him.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; So he's before he comes and reign as
[55:53] king. He has to come into a union. He
[55:56] has to come into a marriage. Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has to come into a Christ has
[56:01] to come into a marriage with his brides.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; So only when he comes into a marriage
[56:05] with a bride now is ready to go and set
[56:07] up his kingdom. Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Now therefore now he can come we can
[56:13] crown him king of kings,
[56:15] &gt;&gt; lord of lords.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; And remember the pyramid never did have
[56:24] a capstone on it.
