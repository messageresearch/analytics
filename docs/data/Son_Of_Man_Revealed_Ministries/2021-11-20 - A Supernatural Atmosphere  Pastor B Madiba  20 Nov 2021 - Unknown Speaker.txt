catching amen discerning amen hallelujah and that's the work of the holy spirit amen that was promised we don't speak of a historical god we speak of a present tense reality jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen amen brother branham says what a resurrection that was a great resurrection that we celebrate but he goes on to say what a resurrection this is amen to be quickened to life again amen amen hallelujah that was the head coming to life but now the rest of the body coming to life amen oh bless the name of jesus amen amen so certainly looking forward to a blessed time this evening amen in the presence of the lord amen i hope you brought your best amen i hope you brought your best hallelujah yay many many man just gonna remind you you get what you expect amen so we're gonna show you a little prophecy that took place and how this church started amen brother caleb if you put out this quote we're going to read this quote first then i'm going to relate the story to you so brother branham says here amen let's just go up a little bit so we get context not from there will kill you slightly up okay let's go to the beginning of that paragraph right so he says so i've watched for something as it slipped by us in humility and we've missed it is it gone and the church is left in our sins if that be so then it's later than you think if not then there's coming one with a message that's straight on the bible and quick work will circle the earth now watch this when he prophesies here the seeds will go in newspapers reading material until every predestinated seed of god has heard it amen none of them will come unless the father has drawn them and everyone that the father has drawn will hear it and come amen that'll be the predestinated seed will hear the word of god so this is for family members only amen it's by invitation only amen so telling you the history of how it started was you got to have a pastor yes amen you got to have one with vision so you know amen for those of you don't know the former pastor of the church pastor rani gang and amen so he was working in a factory i think it was a factory aluminium place so there it was the lunch break and the people were there playing cards around the table and my dad was walking past and he noticed the newspaper that they were playing under there you notice the newspaper there was an advert in the paper now what is that a newspaper what did brother branham said the seeds will go in newspaper newspaper all right this may not interest you but it's important for this church amen amen so but father god then you talked about while you were playing you tore the portion out so god laid on pastor dan naidu's heart to put an article in the paper if you want free books tapes contact this number amen yes so my father wrote for it but the point i'm stressing that prophecy came to pass amen yes what the prophet prophesied the seeds will go in newspapers amen then he wrote to pass it down pastor dan said in books amen then he sent him to the real to real tape and i tell you the rest is history amen because once he came out he never went back in there and through that there's a church standing here durban amen in phoenix amen for the last 40 something years amen there's a bride a portion of the bride here on the face of the earth a predestinated bride one that the father called one whose names were in the lands book of life amen hallelujah hallelujah so we've got a lot of supernatural testimonies amen so i'm going to call our brother joshua he's going to share a testimony with you amen more about the supernatural and what god has been doing with us not just back 1951 but showing you a present tense reality of god hebrews 13 8 we'll invite our brother joshua to come forward and share that testimony amen hallelujah give the lord a good and praise amen [Applause] how many of you were so excited last night left drunkenness hey man amen amen amen just before i share my testimony i'll read the portion of scripture from psalms 40 it says our waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the myrrhy clay amen and set my feet upon a rock and establish my goings aren't you glad tonight that we are at that bottomless pit aren't you glad there was a call to say come out of her my people be not partakers of a sin yes and the plagues don't fall on you amen amen i can say i'm one of them amen amen just a short testimony when i first came into the cross cross paths with this wonderful message i was in bible college and we were doing a topic on divine healing so my dad said to me you need to go to a place called voice of god library and there you will meet a certain brothers and ask them for a specific book called the prophet visit south africa amen amen amen how significant that is tonight yes because we're celebrating this 70 years since the prophet visits africa amen so i went to the voice of god library and there were three of us that went there but it was only one that stayed behind man and from the three of us that wendy i went there specifically asking for this book that was my intention just to go to get this book called the prophet was in south africa but at that time remember we didn't have the usb forms we didn't have the table and things like that everything was in printed form yes and they didn't have the book in print form they didn't have stock of it at that time they said sorry brother we don't have this book but we'll give you this book called the mansion from god will give you this book the seven church ages saying that you're a student of the world we'll give you the book the seven church ages and a man sent from god i tell you when i started reading those books i couldn't stop amen amen i couldn't even move from the place when i started reading these books but thank god as i came along and i believed the message and i didn't go back from there there was no turning back from there amen and so as i was in the message one day i'm driving i was i'm a policeman and i was driving early in the morning on west street and i had my partner with me and we're driving along west street and i was pondering as we came across city hall i was pondering upon how the prophet came and how the angel of god was there and all the supernatural that took place in city hall and just thinking on those things it was a normal working day it was a quiet morning and i was just thinking about that and as we were driving just past it on the opposite side of city hall on the left-hand side where you get the medwood garden there was we was being flagged down some from some members of the public the police vehicle was being flagged down so i stopped and there was this white lady who was a nurse at eddington hospital and i want you i want to tell you something today let's watch our midwife and she works in edington hospital he's a white lady and she was a middle-aged woman and she was waiting for the minor bus to go to work to headington hospital and while she was waiting there there was a lady that was giving birth opposite the city all so i now thinking about was forgotten now and i went to the scene now and now i'm focusing on this i immediately called the control room to get an ambulance i said i'm getting abundance really urgently there's a lady that's about to give birth and you know it speak out it was going to peak hours so you know the ambulance take long and there was no ambulance coming eventually the midwife helped the lady deliver the baby delivered the baby and the baby was born still born and the midwife being that she thinks the baby is still born and she's sitting there with the baby in arms the baby is blue in body uh blue in color and no movement nothing just still won when i told the control room the baby is recording code blue the baby is called blue means deceased born still born so as we were there for a while i had a camera on me and i filmed the baby the mother just the incident because we had kids small babies at the time so it was like a sad situation so i filmed it i withered it baby being still born and the mother and i didn't think anything of it and then i don't know what happened to me i was standing there i didn't think anything further about the supernatural ending something just made me go on my knees the midwife had the baby in the hams the mother was there and i just went down i don't know what happened i can't even remember what i said or what i prayed i touched the baby's heart and i don't remember what i said hey man and the dog just started moving [Music] [Applause] the babies [Music] and she even gave it and i did another further video after that where the midwife testified of what happened my partner was with me he was shocked the people were there they were shocked and i was just i don't know it wasn't expecting a supernatural event but i was just pondering on what happened [Music] that was just one of the many events that took place but what are we saying what i was saying to the church a few weeks ago that we are saying that jesus christ is alive we are speaking about the resurrected jesus amen then the world needs to see jesus christ alive and how is he seeing it jesus christ alive they sing it through a many members we are seeing jesus christ through us manifesting to us amen we are the manifested we are christ being reproduced again among the earth if the world had to see grace again is through the bride amen amen god richly bless you amen [Applause] amen hallelujah amen you believe he's still the same god amen he's still the miracle working god and tonight you can receive your miracle amen you can receive your healing you can receive your salvation you can receive your deliverance amen whatsoever you desire tonight amen in the spiritual supernatural atmosphere amen all things are possible to them that believe amen let's stand up together sing a song and amen invite our dear pastor madiba to come forward and share the word of the lord with our savior let's say only believe only believe amen all things are possible only believe amen [Music] all things are possible [Music] [Applause] [Music] i challenge you tonight to take the limits off of god [Music] amen we have untapped resources [Music] all things are possible [Music] everything [Music] lord i believe lord sing it again lord i believe lord i believe that all things are possible [Music] lord i believe [Music] amen [Music] all of you in the name of our lord jesus christ amen how many were moved by the testimony [Music] thank you i believe that hundred percent amen amen amen brother branham says as mary pondered on her way yes the angel of the lord appeared to so his brother joshua pondered on the supernatural that transpired god said i'm gonna confirm that it's not some fairy tale that's a reality i'm gonna i'm going to make your experience yeah yeah because you respect what happened many years ago you know people cannot get much because they look at the bible they say it's far-fetched stories but those that embrace it as a reality god is bound to repeat the bible days in their life amen we appreciate it a lot and we appreciate the ganging family for their hospitality and the elders of the church and the whole assembly we really much appreciate amen now let us just turn our bibles in just acknowledging the ministers in our midst we really appreciate them me speaking here doesn't mean i'm better i think ministers can do even much better job but i think it is just by grace that i speak to you this evening amen i want to speak about a supernatural atmosphere amen a supernatural atmosphere and i went just to turn to the book of proverbs the fourth chapter between the 30 verse proverbs the fourth chapter the 23rd it written this manner and as you have done last night just read after me keep thine hearts with all diligence are the issues of life protect your heart amen because out of it cometh the issues of life amen yes sir amen brother says the human heart was made to be heavy amen amen and tonight if anything makes you a heart and happy we want to come against that thing in the name of jesus amen amen amen now just the background of the scripture luke 8 verse 51 it was when jesus was invited to the judge of jared's house and to come and pray for his daughter he found the mixed multitude he asked them to be excused and said to leave then he remained with peter james and john amen it says when he came into the house all right are you here josh [Music] and you just wave to the lord did you just wave to the lord to the back amen let's try one more time and when he came into the house and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save peter and james and james and john and the father and the mother of the media and the father and the mother of the baby remain here in episodes of your life not every person can go through certain episodes of your life with you yeah there are times when you say you're my relatives i love you but here i'm gonna go through with believers amen how many know what i'm doing does everybody in the building have a prayer prayer circuit you've got to have people that you've got in your prayer cycle people when when the chiefs are down you phone them and you know that i speak to that brother and that brother yeah they agreed to get together to pray over them this matter is going to be resolved do you have certain individuals if you don't have i advise you to get to them amen it's good to talk about modern stuff good cars good phones good houses but there are times when you need good prayer oh yes people that can back you up in prayer amen amen let's read it john 14 verse 20 and that day two thousand years ago amen you went into calvary and died between the heavens and the earth dear god is not because you were powerless but you've been the most powerful one and subjected yourself to a powerless position amen so that we that are powerless they can come into power [Music] dear god with some amazing grace yes this building many of them remember where you took them from some of them dear god were hopeless cases amen yes empty space yes you came dear god and lifted them out and took them from being a nobody to somebody [Applause] yes lord and today they go to their family members look at them amen and they wonder what happened yes it was tonight i'm reporting for duty praise the lord it is lovely that before i come before this assembly dear god my brother stood here and gave a testimony how you restored a life of a baby america i believe that testimony dear god amen and i believe the same god that helped the brother joshua to pray for the baby yes that same god is in the bed and if there are dirty areas in our lives by grace we pronounce life into those days your people tonight may have various needs some needs are american some are physical some are financial diagram but i know nothing is impossible with you whatever they need you will provide it to your home we can brag about your greatness amen and dear god as i'm reporting for duty anoint my lips amen anointing to the ear cd of god so that whatever is going to be spoken here let it be for the edification let it be for your glory okay amen and we blessed your god even the local pastor pastor gangnam here together with his family and the man dear god you pray for the mom number of years she labored as a parent together with her husband and through their testimony many came to know the lord amen and dear god i guess their heart must be bubbling with joy when she looks at the sun speaking and preaching the same gospel that the father it is their greatest desire of every parent to see their children rising spiritually so dear god we thank you dear god as we commit everything to you in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you richly amen amen it's much it's not so much about today eloquent according to your expectations i was told there are children in one country where they experience humanitarian crisis the red cross was there with the un distributing meals and they came with their containers and everybody came with a small container and the person people that were dishing out to the soup they were just dishing out to everyone but in the queue there was somebody that had quite a big pot and everybody was wondering what is going to happen with this spot and obviously after they disturbed for them they would wait a day just to observe what's going to happen to the big part and when this one came with a big pot it was filthy to the brain and these ones came and complained and said how can you feel such a big part yeah and the question was asked of them did i not feel up yours hey man yes they said you filled up yours she said i give according to expectations i don't know how many broads [Music] but the lord is going to fill them up according to your expectation expectation is a breeding ground for me amen how many know that expectation is a breeding ground for miracles if you come expecting to find mistakes there will be many amen and the devil will point you and say look at that listen to that but if you come and say lord i'm looking for a good amen we're gonna catch you the fantastic blessing tonight i'm looking for a blessing i'm looking for the lord to move as he's speaking to you i hope you will speak to me hallelujah i want to speak about a supernatural atmosphere amen it is amazing that my brother did not know he does not have access to my nose but he for some reason as much as we were squeezed for time he said but we need to make a turn at the race course and said for i just wanted us to take a walk there and we went there and we pulled over and we got out of the car and we're just chatting as we're chatting the way a few golfers today and they signal to us that we must we must we must be silent hallelujah amen and then after we walk to pass to them then we are there and uh somewhat i'm like god are you saying something when the seventh seal was revealed when the seven still was open there was a silence hallelujah before the supernatural can be made known and then we walked on that racetrack and i looked around and i began to imagine 70 years ago how people filled up with that place amen and how the angel of the lord and i looked and i said there is no pa system that could have been effective in 1951 to cater the number of people that were there but i believe the angel of the lord became the pa system and people had the message in their own uh languages and there was the supernatural effect upon the lives of the people then as we were working there then we began to talk about then he mentioned about this how his dad came into the message and i begin to think what what is heaven like tonight what is heaven like i mean i can imagine if you arrive in heaven and you say i'm from devon south africa i think brother must call you by the hand and say we need to say brother brennan amen he's from the she's from devon or he's from david and i can begin to imagine how you are dead is giving a report and say brother branham 70 years later the message is moving the table did not stop it you wanted to come and preach it but the message is being preached among the african people one more time amen and it's really talked to speaks to what i spoke about last night god will never be defeated this purpose in our lives will never be defeated hallelujah can we say amen to you amen now brother branham listen to the quotation and you know certain things are inspired by god that's my aim in conor i was talking to the pastors about the brother that a sister was was married to assistance the brother wasn't working and this brother was the aiming corner in church and the sister said you are a man is too loud and he's drawing unnecessary attention to ourselves would you just be kind and really shush with your amen your shoes are on out i'll buy you shoes if you cooperate in church so he came to church and as the minister was ministering the brother was silent and the pastor was wondering what happened to the brother the church was wondering what happened to the brother meanwhile as the weight was coming forth the engine of the brother was getting water and water right immediately the cbc stood up and said shoes without shoes glory be to god [Music] the message why christ speak as my brother will bring quotations on the screen partner 46 the prophet of god says i think no church in its practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot thrive until the supernatural amen is made known among that people amen and they see it something that they can talk to and that will talk back to them that vindicates the written ways what does it mean folks our churches will not thrive because they have eloquent speakers our churches will not thrive because they've got educated speakers our churches will not thrive just because they've got connected to preachers our churches will thrive when the supernatural amen is made known among the people amen and they come and they talk to something and he talks back to them and vindicates in the written way amen i think brother joshua if somebody was to tell you that god is not alive you're gonna say this is a lie amen because i saw a dead baby and i knew that the baby was dead amen but i prayed over a dead body and life returned to a dead body so therefore no one will talk you out of that experience how many how many know what i'm talking about where critics wanted it to make you unstable and disorientate you but the more they spoke the more you became rooted i know what i'm talking about how many if you if you have been in the battle and the devil has never attempted to derail you you have not yet been in the battle i think the elders would understand when you have been in the battle there are wounds in the bed there are things that you have dealt with in the battle some of them you cannot even share it with other people they are only known to you what the devil tried to do in your life but tonight you are still staying it is not because of your mind it's not because of your ability it's not because of your intellect it's because you are supernaturally connected to the supernatural god some people will never go back no matter how it gets tough they will never go back there are people that are made of job meetings no matter what they go they can go through losses but they will come and even the devil said case your god but they will turn around say no there is a god that is alive i will never kiss my god another case the day on which i was born rather than to cast my god such people have got spiritual integrity why is because they've experienced the supernatural amen there are people that experience a church if you experience a church is not perfect in the church people are at different stages of maturity somebody's going to offend you somebody's going to step on your toes and if you have never been exposed to the supernatural it will be easy for you to be dislocated it will be easy for you to be despondent and stay at home and they will not worship god but there are people even when they come to church and the pastor doesn't greet them they don't care they're not here for their pastor they're here because they've been exposed to something supernatural i'm not in the message to impress anyone i'm here because i experienced something supernatural the table will never talk me out of my experience i don't know what i'm talking about so no church can thrive unless the supernatural is made to know amen are you still with me something that can vindicate the written weight so therefore when we say jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's a statement anybody can say that statement but when that statement moves from being a statement and gets actualized in the lives of the people and people experience that name on it's not just a statement i experience what they are talking about you know there was a young man that came to church on a wednesday night in one assembly and as the preacher was preaching the young men who were sitting there battling with the thought of being an atheist and say really is there is it really the god and the young man said to god if you are there you had much better show that you are alive immediately after the service he got into the car on his home to the flat but as he was in the car uh something just nudged him and said stop by the filling station he stopped you by the feeling station and someone said you need to get into the filling station buy bread and milk he got into the store he bought bread and milk he cut back into the car he was trying to go home as he was facing towards his house they then whatever was nudging him said don't go there turn right and begin to direct him 10 left you know the same navigation system yes that directed brother branham where the plane was grounded now it began to direct this young man say turn left and right and showed him sit in the house and say get out and get into this house bring the bread and the milk and he went in and he knocked on the door and when he knocked on the door an old man opened the door and when the old man opened the door and he greeted the old man behind in the background there was a voice of a woman or an old woman that spoke and said honey is it the angel of the lord that is bringing us bread and butter [Applause] the young man dropped a bread and american cheese stream down his cheeks that night god was showing him that i am alive but i'm not gonna use anybody i'm gonna use you today to demonstrate that i'm alive so when that young man if you talk to him and say there is no god he will tell you there is no search i've experienced the question that i'm talking about i'm talking about the supernatural force something that is beyond the naked eye something that is hidden from the naked eye but that is there and as real as i am tonight are you still with me amen now brother i looked into the race course many things happened we've read the book the prophet visits south africa there's never i mean that book when you read it it gives you the effect of what happened in 1951 you you experience it you feel it as you are reading i think the brother that wrote the book he was quite meticulous in how he captured the events until they become very vivid to the mind now when you read that then you begin to ask yourself that we we needed this god amen that operated then to operate now and we want to check and i said last night that god is still alive amen but but there's got to be people that bring him on the scene it was william branham that brought him on the scene but tonight william branham is not here you've got to bring the same coach on the scene are you still with me now in the message question and answers paragraph 391 as my brother brings it up on the screen brother branham say but let me say this there will come a message folks when brother you know brother always spoke about in parables he couldn't come and say i'm the one that's why he said there will come another one yeah and later people take that statement and they have funny imaginations but we the competing students of the week we know that there are only seven method [Music] are you saying with me but it says but let me say this they will come they will come a message they welcome a messenger i believe that if it's to be a man it will be somebody after me but this message this message that i'm preaching is the true message of this day and is the last message [Music] there is a message coming in the same statement saying this is the last message you know you can't have the message without the messenger you are simply saying i'm the last messenger are you still but let's take it further he said you see what i'm do he said you see what i'm doing brethren you are just as much into it as i am you are messengers amen yes you are messengers of this same message do you hear what brother branham is doing here he says i am the messenger of this message i am the last one to bring this message but i am putting you all because you are into this message as much as i'm into this message i'm putting you on the same ground this one is not only for the pastor it goes for the body of christ it goes for you sisters as well brother brother said we are coming to the same level what does it mean it means the same things that william branham was entitled to we are entitled to the same thing tonight if wilhelm brown was able to have access to the supernatural tonight we must have access to the supernatural it's not for the minister only it's not for the deacons only is not for the trust is only it's for you as well right way in your corner you've got access to the supernatural when your child is sick rather than calling the pastor there are times where you say lord i've got access to you amen let me lay my hands upon my baby and you will lay your hands upon your baby and say in the name of jesus christ as your mother and the very healing over you right there god is obligated to honor your prayer as much as you honor brother branham's prayer why because we are now on equal basis because i didn't put myself there brother he is putting us on the same basis because we are into this message as much as he's into this message what does it mean every time brother branham would come and preach every time you look around and say you know what i'm waiting for and he looked around and said now he is here hallelujah and in one message you say the angel of the lord is not three steps from where i am when people came on the podium you say uh sister you you realize there is something strange something unusual don't worry it's the angel of the lord amen hallelujah that angel of the lord was never buried amen hallelujah there is not a grave for that angel of the lord that means wherever the bride of jesus christ gather they must have an expectation they must have an expectation tonight your expectation should not be of brother made evil and the expectation should be the same angel that was with william brennan may he come and grace us with his praises may he move from a chair to a check and minister to your needs this angel knows who you are you know brother branham speaks to his sister as the sister was there and brotherly says to this sister sister and this this sister had a sick child or what she presumed was a sick child brother princess sister you you you've been with the catholic church and you left to the catholic yeah and you took run about in a year without going to church and later you went and joined up with the pentacostas and you laughed to them and you got married to somebody and you got separated from that person and now you are here and the brother says to that sister there is nothing wrong with your child amen it says this thing came upon the child because the lord wants to bring you in if you run away from the lord the lord is gonna find amen and say i rather bring myself then the lord shall come and drag me amen hallelujah i hope we are together amen now in the message divine love we're gonna have a good time amen of 18. brother brenda say now you've got to create an atmosphere and your faith will do it amen you know this evening we can create we whatever atmosphere amen if you walk into a nightclub you're gonna find the creative atmosphere the djs they're with the music they're creating an atmosphere and the spirit that loves the night love will feel comfortable there because they created an atmosphere even in the church we've got to create an atmosphere for the supernatural the supernatural doesn't just come there's got to be an atmosphere created first and after the atmosphere is right then the atmosphere will breed the supernatural how many i know what i'm talking about the angels don't visit our houses anymore because the atmosphere is not right but he says we need to get certain things out of our houses we need to get our houses in order then the angels will visit our houses let me tell you the angel when he's in your house i remember when he was in the house of brother branham and becky was sleeping on the bed and she was busy rolling on the bed and she came on the edge of the bed and it was a matter of time that if she rolled she would have fallen off the bed but as she was on the edge the angel of the lord came to brother bremen saying it's time to go and check the baby then he rushed to where the baby was they found the baby on the on the edge of the bed and he was able to save the baby the angel of the lord is not only interested in of the lord is interested in small details what is happening in your house hallelujah i'm telling you where the angel that can come into your house and be there on permanent basis you've got to create an atmosphere and your faith will do it they were all in the upper room with one accord it's amazing every time whenever you want to see a church on the move of god and the supernatural happening the church has to be in one account there's got to be a unity of of hearts the singleness of mind hallelujah expected brother branham says when the church is united hallelujah it makes the pastor hear amen you know every time i look at my church brother i dream i see no matter what lord let it not be like the corinthian church i needed to be like the ephesians was so problematic amen you know when the church is so divided there are no blessings amen yes it's just a complaint after completely yes and when hearts are full of complain i'm going to show they create a demonic atmosphere but when hearts are full of holiness love peace that those hearts create a specific atmosphere and then the lord will love that atmosphere are you still with me yes sir amen i keep interrupting myself let me finish the call now it says that we're all in the upper room with one accord when suddenly they came from heaven as the sound of a rushing mighty wind the atmosphere was right it takes an atmosphere to do anything you know the regular procedure to hatch chickens is to put them under the hand yeah but they get the ache in the right atmosphere it will hatch in the house amen if a man loves god and the right kind of an atmosphere he could get into it will produce a newborn baby just as certain as i'm here is the atmosphere that counts let this little handful of people sit in here tonight get in the perfect atmosphere watch what takes place there will not be a fable among us in our midst the cripples will walk amen the blind will see the time will hear the time will speak without prayer for you for you to get something from god it's not because you want you need to invite brother madima to come and preach for you and you get something you as a group with the right atmosphere when you are united together and you become prayerful then god loves the atmosphere right there without a prayer somebody is on a wheelchair and they just stand up and say now i can walk amen without a prayer it is the atmosphere and brethren said tonight we can create that atmosphere what produced the german meeting what is that why there was an atmosphere but we'll produce the result tonight it is an atmosphere amen amen amen hallelujah let's come in the message god's provided way of healing paragraph 29 the prophet says if you don't mind amen amen some places if you take off the jacket you lose half of the church i would hope i won't lose you

right remember this sickness runs in the family the grandmother had it the mother heard it you've got it your children have got it but tonight i'm here and say you can be a cycle break and say yes my grandmother hated my mother you can define and say lord i hear the word tonight but i'm gonna do something about it the way yes i hear it but i'm gonna act upon the weight by receiving this way and professing on the folks we are looking for the results not from the pastor in your life we are looking for you to produce the supernatural in your life so god comes and becomes resident amen and explain the way but you've got you to receive the weight he said that's what sets it on fire amen amen hallelujah that's what set it up he said brother when you receive it the revelation something slaves out of the unseen wealthy owner there is a channel tonight that is connected to this church it's not sabc it's not a tv it's a supernatural channel yes there is sabc there's pictures there is a soccer match going on there is music going on but in the same vein there is a supernatural channel there is that channel there is hearing going there's blessings going there is deliverance going hallelujah and now it depends where you're gonna eat amen it's not for me you on your chest you are responsible for your results that where am i gonna tune in and i'm gonna wander in my mind or i'm going to concentrate on the supernatural channel and when you concentrate on that something slips out you wonder in the mystical channel it comes dropping down is when you receive it praise the lord the revelation something slips out of the unseen world you wonder comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul that says now i see it your eyes are blending your leaves that hang down straighten up and smile hallelujah every muscle in your body seems to rejoin amen you don't need to be in the prayer line then you've got it today [Music] if everybody in this building yes sir at this time amen would get in that kind of attitude amen every person would be perfectly amen here tonight if everybody in this building right now we're getting to that attitude folks as i'm preaching now i understand the table is telling you about the burdens that you have yeah some of you tells you the credit card is overdue because i'm preaching you are running the numbers stop the calculator listen to what i'm saying even if you run the numbers the numbers will remain the same as they went before the savings but adventure you listen to me the numbers may change when you when you open up to the supernatural channel if you left somebody sick at home right here the hearing can go where they are if somebody is somewhere maybe it's in job and it's your loved one and sick hearing can go wherever they are first from here we can send the spiritual energy anywhere in the world and it can reach anywhere in the world no matter how dire the need may be from here tonight this group can direct a blessing a healing and deliverance anywhere around [Music] [Music] there are heavenly blessings that must drop down in your life because maybe you are sitting there you are looking for a job our our job don't come from the minister of finance no no no we have got another economy above the south african economy god can create a job i said god can create a job a company can phone you and say look we were thinking we need a position but we thought of you if not them is god moving the elements and tonight god can move the elements oh i'm looking for believers that can allow god to win i'm looking for believers that can say we need the results amen amen amen praise the lord now listen to what brother branham says here in the message the african trib report of six he says he he took a machine now just think he took a machine you know the human being is not made to lie amen you cannot made to lie the moment you lie then there is tension in your ability amen you know that yeah you you were never made into allah amen and the problem is that when you learn you've got to find more light to cover up the festival yes amen let me give you something maybe i feel like to speak on this you know when when you've got when you're growing up and you've got siblings and maybe you do something very naughty and one of the siblings sees you may be doing something and says i saw you yes but i'm not going to do anything about it you owe me yes now every evening when is the attempt to make the dishes they just turn around and look at your direction and not and you know what needs to happen imagine if that sibling is out to play with friends and now you go to mummy and say mommy you know on such and such a day i did something that i wasn't supposed to do and i feel very sorry about what i did yes and i thought maybe i should level matters with you and make it right i did this and that and i'm here to save mommy i wasn't supposed to do it hey i am profusely sorry for water amen yes sir and mommy says my child you know what you are forgiven don't worry about it don't ever do it again yes now when your sibling comes in the evening and that day visitors were around this thing is full with dishes and after you are done eating and the sibling turns at you and knows you're going to look at them and say shrug your shoulders and now they wonder what is going on yes and say you see you can do whatever you want you know what has set you free your confession so tonight there are times when you want to worship god but the devil says no to you amen make it right amen so the next time when he said not you say lord i'm the right one to say amen amen amen amen praise the lord now but i would say the human being was is not meant to lie and if you are telling a lie they can put you before a lie detector and your nerves will react then the likes of brother joshua's the policeman they know very well they put you in the machine and you react yes and it says then they took this same thing the same line detector and converted it into a way that they could tell whether it was truth or not and put it on a person pray i think it taken i forget how many thousand kilowatts to send a radio message around the world yes when this woman begin to pray at her death they went out enough power from her until it resisted over as far as the little would go enough power leaving that woman actually supernatural power that caught on this machine some kind of a magnetic power of a prayer that was powerful enough to send a radio message 55 times around the world do you hear they took a lightning detector machine converted it and say we're going to measure somebody who's the power and converted to the power they realized that you could send the ruling message around the world 55 times so i'm sitting here and saying wherever you're when you pray there is so enough enough voltage that can go around the world that's why i say and send a message to united states of america the message will go there and arrive in real time i hope we are together amen brother maybe skip this one let's go to revelation book of symbols brother branham says angelic beings associated together amen amen i hope you get to that that just dropped right down free look amen if you've got the holy spirit in you then you are a candidate for association with the unseen world the supernatural yes when you've got to the holy ghost now you're a candidate of the unseen world i don't know how many in the building know or have experienced you are driving some time alone but right out of nowhere you feel that i'm no longer alone amen it's not it's not goals to folks wherever we go there is supernatural wealth with us sometimes you are in the house alone but you know that now i'm no longer alone there is a movement in the house it's not a ghost it's the supernatural amen but but you've got to be you've got your consciousness of the supernatural side i don't know brother i don't know whether have you realized when you have bought kia the day you take it from the dealership all you see on the road is the chaos and until you realize i didn't know that japan had this lot of gears it's because because now you are a kia person you see kias around once you associate with the supernatural you get accustomed to the supernatural if one time when you see the supernatural and experience the supernatural in jail you will always want to experience that and every time you come to church you say lord i need the same effect because what you are used to to that and when it is not there you get worried a lot i didn't feel your presence may i feel your presence when i go on wednesday meeting but when you are a believer that just comes to church and go home it's ritualistic there are no results at some point in time the devil is gonna catch up with you that's right and the german is gonna create mind betters in your life and you're gonna get disoriented in your life but i said get accustomed to the supernatural i want to know that lord you are there hallelujah and when you get accustomed to that then lord will make sure that every time you come he will honor your expectation how many came with expectations how many came with expectations from the super day lord i'm going to change but i don't know this sickness may not come out of church amen you want to heal me lord you're going to deliver me lord you're going to touch me lord you're going to re-energize me spiritually but i'm not going to go back [Music] and every time when people go into the pastor's office to deliver testimonies you've got a list of complaints right after coverage we don't want to complain i want you to connok into the pastor's office and the pastor and puts the head of goliath on the pastor's tables i killed together amen now there is something here because brother brennan speaks about something that today maybe brother the quotation that we just skipped the on africa report paragraph survey says man waking around in science has found god that's right he lives out there he is in the scientific world yeah they just touch around on his little basic play things i mean television is what god plays with that's right yes but sensibility makes it like it's a big deal yes that's right yeah wifi it's some of the things that god plays with there's some where i'm going they just touched around on his little basic play things that he plays with or has out there for them now they are coming up into a place in a category where they can find him and in one message says i'm afraid the science will find god before the church does yeah that's an in document it's a direct quotation i think yeah must have read it but there is some way where i'm going the scripture says god to the heart because out of it flows the issues of life amen there is something that we want to look at the heart how many know how many know there are people brother brennan and that quotation will come to it he says there are people that we just want to be around yeah amen and he says there are people as good as they may be you don't want to be around them yeah there's a direct how many know what i'm talking about there's nothing wrong with this brother or that sister but you don't just appreciate to be around you don't hate them yeah but it's because of the atmosphere that a person creates you wherever you go as an individual you create an atmosphere psychology doesn't know what to call it they call it an aura atmosphere when i meet brother adrien and he greets me at the airport and as we drive he will feel the atmosphere around me and i will feel the atmosphere around him and if the atmosphere is similar then we begin to enjoy one another but if they are not similar i can't wait when is brother leaving [Music] so there is an atmosphere around you science they went that is what we call a magnetic field pattern or magnetic field is what they use as uh when they do the compass and as well as the uh the magnets and so forth so they went to look into the human heart and they found that the human heart transmits magnetic field to pattern that means around you there is an energy around you the brotherhood causing the atmosphere but science is going to the granular level and calling it out what it is according to their language that means they say when when you have got maybe a negative atmosphere yeah maybe somewhat maybe let me say you are sorrowful and you go i mean you know you have been to a funeral home have you been to a house where there is a funeral as soon as you park your car you can sense the atmosphere you cannot walk into there and and be joyful because while the atmosphere is an atmosphere of money yes and when you get today even if you are not money you end up moaning because you are consumed by the atmosphere how many who know what i'm talking about and the same day you may go to a wedding and when you get to the wedding you are not in a morning mood but we are now in a celebrated mood because the atmosphere is the atmosphere of celebration what is happening the hearts that are there are transmitting an energy of happiness and when you get into that atmosphere you are consumed by that energy [Applause] it reminds me of her brother the sister every time when she came back from chad she used to rejoice you know at church it was wonderful oh the man of god preached until you know how brother says until the brother got very jealous and say all right next sunday i need to go and check what really makes my wife happy at church and then the next sunday he went to church he took a seat today now look what happened the same atmosphere that consumes the wife on weekly basis consumed it and after church it was no longer the why but now it was here again atmosphere amen the person that you are sitting next to an tonight that they create based on what is in their heart amen it can be an atmosphere of unbelief it can be an atmosphere of faith as we are sitting right now where you are the person next to you has quite an atmosphere yes amen now let me give an example two brothers are sitting next to each other in church a minister is ministering one is sleepy and one is awake the awake one keeps on waking up this one in no time both of them are sleeping what happened an atmosphere was sleeping was there now this atmosphere were fighting until the other brother was swallowed up by the atmosphere of sleeping that's why when i'm in church and i wake up somebody and they keep on sleeping i move i find another chain at least i become a victim because when you are around a person they transmit an atmosphere you know when i'm checking you come to church you are rejected say amen and as you are saying when you turn around you are sitting next to one somebody they are wondering what is going on then you want another note let me find another one so that when we say amen we are able even to give each other high five because we are now in the right atmosphere so tonight i'm asking you what atmosphere are you creating in this church tonight you as an individual on your chain what atmosphere are you creating let's take it further when they arrived at the house of jairus and jesus requested everybody to leave he wanted to make sure that the people that are there will be the people of the same atmosphere he did not want the interruption of the atmosphere aim of unbelief and he requested unbelievers to leave amen to remain with believers and i wonder tonight if all of us here can be in the atmosphere of faith and in our heart resonate to the statement all things are possible to them that believe amen and everyone surrenders to that statement and the inspiration behind that statement and say i believe it and the whole atmosphere will be under the atmosphere of faith and we begin to look at the people that came depressed the doubt the spirit gets lifted up the song leader as he led songs tonight yeah all he was doing it's not a performance yeah some living is not a performance it's a ministry people are coming they've got different thoughts they went through different battles and a song leader comes here and he had much better be played up that you'll be able to remove your mind from your consent from your parents and you will come here and your mind is focused and you are under expectation for the way that's what reading is all about it's it's a very important ministry in the church i think brother tv he was going to say so that when the seat weight comes amen it can be able to be conceived amen amen let's come to this so you get to the issue of the atmosphere yes amen amen to talk and help to change the atmosphere ask questions and really make you relax and by the time we we leave you realize it was foolishness when we fought what happened we changed the atmosphere amen now in this message my brother a personal experience with god paragraph 48 brother brown said let me while they are lining up with the people let me ask this how many he believes that the most essential thing yes because there's a spirit of neglect in the end time yeah that's right now i'm going to give you a little secret if you love people people will know amen when you love people you don't need to announce amen when people are in your atmosphere they can sense in life are you still with me that says did you know that man is a creator in himself yeah amen how many believe that he is the son of god in his fallen condition amen that means wherever you go you as a son of god you create an atmosphere amen that's why you as the son of god if you're at work people are complaining don't join in that's right separate yourself yes you are off a different maker you're off a different material if you complain as they complain you're gonna be solid by other atmosphere but you need to step back and say hang on i'm a son of god i'm a creator yeah brother frederick walked into the house and sister mirey is nervous the children are there is chaotic brother he realized i am a son of god i'm a creator i'm gonna change an atmosphere and even tonight when we come here no matter what you're going through we can change your atmosphere no matter what the atmosphere looks like at all we can change the atmosphere in your house and when you leave here you will take the supernatural atmosphere back to your house and what makes the demons typical to be able to stay in the presence of the son of god it is the atmosphere around the son of god it is the atmosphere around the church of god you know pastor trump as we travel you know being a message pastor you've got to be discerning if brother brother puts me into a hotel and i when i walk into the hotel it's not a matter of just to walk in and be excited and say i'm now in nowhere to know the first thing before i do anything you knelt down it's a lord i'm in this hotel amen room i don't know what happened but in the name of jesus christ for the number of days that i will be here i'm a son of god there must be a heavenly atmosphere amen hallelujah brother walked into a tail and said look change my hotel room yeah they committed adultery a night before yes amen it's when you understand the atmosphere amen i hope i'm too i'm i hope you are with me amen divine 100. paragraph 47 he said now it's a strange thing that how that people the type of people and what we do in our association now we all have to face this effects that there is people that you just love to be around amen and there's people that find people and you love them but yet there is something about you the person that you just can't hardly stay around them now you want to talk of it now the reason that is is because of the atmosphere that the individual himself or herself create that's why you young ones you must listen to your parents if your parent says that's not a good friend don't justify there is something that the parents sensed they may not be able to pinpoint and say this is the problem but the sense of the atmosphere around your friend and if you are respectful you say i may not understand but i'm gonna cut ties with this it will save you a lot of heartache yes sir amen amen we found out that the heart creates an atmosphere praise the lord now first if somebody moves from wheat bank and comes to fellowship here in phoenix and maybe there's a complainer in church without anybody telling them who is the complainer in no time they will be friendly complain because the spirit identifying a spirit that's why the english sin says misery loves company yeah no brother let's come to the book of philippians 4 4 verse 8. brother finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatever things are of good report uh maybe this one you've got to read it with me so that you stay away okay read up to me finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatever [Music] reports [Music] now last night when we spoke about sister haiti we said sister haiti just said the right thing you remember yes now listen to this one brother brennan is out hunting or fishing he's with brother woods and with other brethren and as he was there brother who says to his brother they were jehovah's witnesses before they came into the message yes as they were there brother who says to this uh brother say brother you know sometimes we've got to visit the old mama that used to do home bred for us and we need to go and tell her that we have now accepted to the lord jesus christ brother said when brotherhood said that it impressed the holy spirit yes and the holy spirit felt good and sent your brother tomorrow yes there's going to be something special what i'm going to do here why because brotherhood said the right thing and by saying the right thing it created an atmosphere a supernatural atmosphere sister healthy by saying the right thing it created an atmosphere and tonight if you say the right thing it will create a supernatural atmosphere tomorrow morning as they were there fishing they caught a fish and as they pulled the fish out it was hooked in the mouth yes and when they wanted to unhook it they instead of unhooking they pulled the the what equality interest the interest

fish it's life where did that come from from one brother [Music] amen in the name of jesus christ amen i give you back you alive this this is now a human being this is now a sex-born individual he is now bringing the power of the resurrection not to a human being but to a dirty fish and tonight i say lord jesus what is the feast compared to the church of the living god what is the fish compared to a man or a woman that is called a soul and tonight is the church of the living god we've brought in power maintained by the scripture to pronounce life in dead areas if your finances are dead tonight we can pronounce life in your death finances if your marriage is dead tonight we've gotten the authority to announce and pronounce the life [Music] your children are struggling we can pronounce it hallelujah the churches that we can pronounce why because we are the son of god you are a creator brother who said a son of god is an amateur god in the and of eden we lost our god sheep yes but tonight brother branham became in our generation to demonstrate that god was restored to him that i am in the father and in me and i in you what is happening in the christian mystery it says it is in a threefold manner today it is eyeing your dispensation that's why my brother spoke and said you can give each other rain in my farm i don't have rain you don't look at heaven your brother can look and say my brother let me give you rain in the name of jesus christ and call you will honor it that's the time folks if it's not the time when and if it's not as woo and i say it is the time we are
