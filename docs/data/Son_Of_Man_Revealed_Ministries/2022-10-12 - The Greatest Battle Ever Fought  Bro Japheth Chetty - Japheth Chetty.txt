amen I woke up this morning and I had a heavy fever or shivering amen I didn't feel bad at all but I'm feeling well now amen and we know that the enemy will try all of his tactics he'll try all of his um weapons amen and we know the our war is not physical it's spiritual amen amen face these demon powers where they come in the form of sickness they come in the form of depression or whatever it is but we are facing these demon powers every day we are thankful that he has made us more than overcome us amen for the encounters and we can be gathered here tonight amen the fact that you are here shows that you're already having the victory amen because you're defied amen your body must have told you that you're tired tonight you must have had a long day at work and your body must have been tired but you defied that amen you came to church amen so that's already having the victory amen amen so let's see what the Lord will speak to us tonight amen hallelujah let's just open you know um with our scripture reading for today just want to open to the book of Ephesians chapter 10. 17 first finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand against the vows of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of the world of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto yourself the whole armor of God that yea may be able to stand in the evil day amen having done all to stand yes amen stand therefore having your lines good about the truth having the breastplate of righteousness and your feet short with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen Above All Things The Shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen the enemy is trying with all of his fiery dots amen but we have the shield of Faith amen amen and we can stand strong with the shield of faith that no matter what the enemy throws at our same and we'll be able to withstand yes amen amen and take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Amen and that sword is much more sharper in the end times the word of God has been revealed to us in its fullness amen amen amen we also want to turn to Daniel 12th chapter I'm reading directly from the prophet's quotes here so if I miss out of you scriptures just bear with me and at that time Michael stand up the great Trends were standard for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even unto that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt contentment and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn away many turn away many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever but thou or Daniel shut up the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased any man thank the Lord for the reading of his word and maybe seize it may we thank the Lord once again that we can be in his presence amen amen amen he's great amen amen demons are being sick yesterday and today and also Shekinah as well and Kim has also been unwell and I said I'm not going to let the enemy have the big dream man he said no matter what how sick I am I'm going to come to the house of the Lord and I'm going to preach a man like we heard the other week amen we should not shed from our responsibilities amen amen I shocked for my responsibility at work today though should I stand at home I've got a doctor's not but how many of you know that you can't get a doctor's note for church amen amen you can get a doctor's note for today but you cannot stay away from church amen the prophet said that he said you can skip work but don't skip church yeah amen be thankful for that amen because this is where we come to draw strength from amen hallelujah amen so we know that you're only going to receive what you come expecting amen so you're gonna pull tonight you're gonna pull from the gift because amen like a baby if a baby doesn't electron and doesn't pull to draw the milk came and the baby is not going to get any mug so if you don't latch on tonight if you don't pull you're not gonna get anything out of it amen so you pull you draw strength amen like with Abraham Jehovah said I am El Shaddai the breasted wine amen amen could draw strength from him amen amen so tonight we want to speak a little bit on the greatest battle ever fought amen I will just call it the waft the Mind each I will say that this eve shall not be deceived in this age amen amen we know we are living in this age amen this great mind age and we know at this time that there's only two Powers at work it's God's power and Satan's power amen it might be it might be in many different forms you might have different nations different political genes different religious societies and all kinds of powers at work but it's really only two Powers at work amen God's power and Satan's power yes but amen how many of you know that Satan doesn't have his own power amen the prophet says that Satan can only pervert what God has already done amen amen so Satan takes amen the righteous act we know and he perverts it and that becomes his power and when he takes the truth and he perverts it and that becomes a lie and that's Satan's power amen he doesn't have his own power but we see these two Powers at work and these two Powers have been at work from the beginning amen before even the Garden of Eden amen we know that Satan has been uh fighting this war against God and when he come down to the Garden of Eden the prophet tells us that those two Spirits always we can trace those two Spirits right back to the Garden of Eden amen we see them in Cain and Abel amen Jacob and Esau you see them in Judas and Jesus amen and now in the end time we have the true church and the false church but it's still the same two Powers at work amen amen foreign says that amen God is preparing an army yes amen and he says this Army is getting ready for battle amen but he says that before this Army can get ready for battle God has to select his soldiers amen so Satan is selecting these soldiers amen we see them forming together in all of these One World governments and all of these religious movements but at the same time God has been selecting his soldiers throughout the years amen and we know that he sent the shout amen he sent the shout to call out the living Saints the amen to gather them and to prepare them amen for war amen he never just prepares Amen to be on a picnic amen he prepared us for a while amen this is the battlefield God is selecting his soldiers and so the prophet says once God selects his soldiers he's then going to address them amen amen and we know this so these soldiers are dressed by the word of God amen amen we are dressed footly by the word of God Amen and we have the old Hammer Of God Amen amen and then after they are dressed amen they are selected for for better to go to strip training say Amen it's to condition them to them amen the emotions cannot affect them because they have been conditioned for that environment all God is using these things to train these soldiers for the and he's been conditioned before he is now ready to go into action amen and it's not in the end time and ready to start amen and we know that this battle actually in heaven amen and he fought against Michael and Michael's Kingdom amen this battle which was actually the Earth amen did not originate on the earth amen you start a day in heaven amen and then it fell upon the human beings amen the enemy came when the enemy was cast out and it was cast out onto the Earth he then began to start saying many same tricks he'd be getting started down in the Earth now the prophet says before any battle can be put in a ray they've got to choose a meeting place yeah they've got to choose a place where they're gonna fight the battle [Music] hey when the Israelite Army was was one Army the Israel army and One bank the other Army on the other bank and then in the city was where David met Goliath amen so choose a place that will be ideal for their army to win even you can find this in sports you will find that um you have a home ground advantage uh like many sport clubs want to play in their home ground because they have their advantages the same thing involved you would want to choose a place that will be with the most tactical uh benefit to your army to win yes yes amen so Satan and God had to choose a place that Mutual meeting place was the mind the greatest battle being fought is in the mind amen the prophet says when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a meeting place amen there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin yes and for the battle to rage and the Battlegrounds begin in the human mind amen where did that start with Eve in the Garden of Eden amen amen Satan attacked her by coming and influencing and trying to pervert and make a reason through her mind yes and if she he made it to reason with God's word through our mind so that is why the prophet says that's where it began day is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle the way it was where it began and this is because decisions are made from the Mind amen amen so we know it's like in the end time when Jesus is standing at the door and knocking amen he cannot open that door amen that individual has to make the decision to receive this message of the hour to be baptized in his name to receive the Holy Ghost amen then God comes in and the Holy Ghost comes in and has the preeminence and then you become a prisoner of Christ But first you as the individual has to make the decision amen well until you say come in remember Satan cannot come into your ghost amen the only time Satan can interfere with you then is you go out to be here amen he cannot come and be baptized with the Holy Ghost and have fellowship with you unless you've got to meet him with his five senses see taste smell hear and touch Soul writes on the inside which can either own senses can coexist so you cannot have faith and doubt coexisting you can't have 10 90 faith it doesn't work like that you're a God and we share in the word of God and Faith Comes is where God and Satan is at War now fighting for that sword amen one is Faith and now it's been from the beginning of time amen even when Jesus was on the earth in Jesus in the mind because he said if thou be the Jesus mine and overcome Jesus in the mind but what he didn't do amen Jesus could overcome by the world amen he wasn't Overcoming By the flesh they were coming by the spirit amen amen the prophet says if this church right now could be put together ethnicity trust that every person would be in one Accord but yet Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed what do it your mind is as we said your mind got to accept it it's got to and what is your mind controlled by the prophet says your spirit controls your mind and when your spirit catches the word of God and the word of God is what life in it then it brings that life into you to receive the word of God it brings the life of God Amen amen and when that takes place when the life comes down into that channel amen then the word of God can be many gotta drop down into your soul and through your spirit and into your soul and then the life of God is manifested in and through you so from the middle of the heart which is the soul it's feeding every channel so in the world word of God is down in the middle of your heart and your soul then it starts to feed these different Outlets it's done the enemy is raining in your soul that's when the finale you start to uh question amen so you gotta let God into the control tower amen amen now the prophet is trying to teach us a principle here amen and the prophet says the trouble of it is we stand in in here with a lot of doubt trying to accept what's out there and he says you've got to stop that and come down that Channel with the true word of God and then it goes out he's saying from the soul another word goes out have automatically It's Working Man and then just believe it outside internal aim and it's got to drop down into your soul amen then it starts to project out and the prophet says he's so anxious to see things done do something for God is no doubt anxious like the doctor the resurrection of the Dead the Great Mighty things that our God has done then we are anxious and the thing of it is we try to do these senses to grab a hold of something here like conscious so the prophet he said many times amen we have all of these great things and we want God to do something for our five senses on the flesh we try to grab a hold of it with our five senses in the spirit amen but the prophet is saying no you've got to come to the so many people lots of times as must construed the word and I've been misunderstood by this that I wasn't the problem brother John you know what me and you being neighbors all this time come up here at the altar get down what's he doing the prophet says I wish I had a Blackboard here I could show you what what he's doing he's trying to work through his soul on infections and that doesn't work and now we see this happening in the denominations all the time amen they try to work on your affections they try to work on your emotions amen they try to work on you weeping and crying and trying to plead with you to come to the altar try to make you feel sorry that Jesus died upon the cross for you amen what are they doing they're trying to walk to the outside sensors they imagine but it's not so here in the bride of Christ amen in the blood of Christ the word of God drops down into the soul amen and when God does something in the soul amen then death drives through repentance amen amen you don't have to work on the emote it's driving through his true repentance amen but they try to work on your emotions amen they try to work on the affections you see or May the prophet says maybe he's working on a memory since of his soul John you had a wonderful mother she died uh maybe your great grandfather was a great Pastor in the message amen you see you working on the five senses of memory now amen you say oh maybe uh they lived at the time when the prophet was here and they could see the Miracles they could see what the prophet was doing now you're working on sight amen that's one of your five senses in the flesh is sight that's not the soul amen so it doesn't matter because you was not there the prophet's meeting but yet you believe it kids you didn't hear it then at that time lay a hold of something there so the prophet says you cannot come through your five senses of the flesh or your senses in the spirit like affection and memory but the prophet says it's a free moral agency amen amen you yourself have to let the word of God in and you don't come in because your mother was a good woman or because your neighbor was a Godly neighbor amen you don't come because someone called you just call you to come to church amen amen but you've got to come yourself amen and receive the word of God Amen you come because that God calls you and you accept him on the basis of his word amen and if you can get everything out of the way all conscious all senses and just let the word come in then the word will produce side and just open up the channel amen and say God is eternally true because I'm taking your word amen and that's the battle Prophet says that's the battle that's the thing that from the inside out fails amen now imagine what kind of a faith that's going to be that the prophet says the prophet that even if God was only going to save one you're going to believe yourself to be the one amen if you if the prophet if God was only going to choose one tonight and you were to say you know what God will choose maybe that brother he seems to be the most Cornelius he seems to be the most righteous then there's something wrong with you it is you supposed to be do you want again you cannot die yeah I think that it's going to be someone else now the problem the problem of it is we doubt ourselves sometimes sometimes the one tonight God loves us amen we start to Face mind battles amen can't you see how you feel daily mind that does not mean he has you beaters yet but if you accept what he says then rattlesnakes the prophets who decide to keep it and receive that's the greatest battle amen hallelujah amen that you're not gonna make ends meet amen the enemy is trying to plan you evil thought might crop up into you didn't even have time to let the enemy are trying to put our thoughts in your head imagine the prophet said and the prophet said you can't stop thoughts you can't stop the birds I cannot stop when the enemy just puts a thought in your mind you don't even have time to think it before you even think the toss is dead those are your thoughts and I rebuke you in Jesus name amen so many times when the enemy puts his thoughts in your mind don't the enemy comes and tells you oh but no the doctor knows better okay just down amen amen the doctor by the prophet said when the tree of knowledge cannot do you good anymore then you come over to the tree of life amen hallelujah amen so what's the matter the prophet Channel first amen you've got it the Holy Spirit placed at the battle Amen to take God's word amen amen you the holy spirit in his position amen right there at the Battlefront to take God's word for he is the word and he stands there and there's nothing going to stop it then why because the Bible says if God before me who can be a prophetess just like an old boiler with the flu stopped you put a fire in it and it'll blow your thing up now for those of you who don't know what a flu is it's like a duct or a way for gas or air to flow through it amen so the prophet is saying now these channels that flow from your soul now when you have the word of God in your soul there's got to be a Clear Channel flowing out now from your soul to your spirit to the flesh to the word of God can project right from the soul and manifest itself on the outside they cannot be blocking those channels amen clear amen so that the word of God can flow through you it's because they don't clean the channels out amen they go down the inside you've got to clean it your conscience your memory your thoughts yes amen you got to come into the house of God even when you come into service amen you cannot come amen with your channel is all clogged up amen you gotta come straight up yeah you're gonna come with a clean mind you gotta come with the right atmosphere you gotta come amen with your conscious clear amen not thinking about what went on at work today amen not thinking about what trials you are facing amen laying aside everything and come from the inside out with the adulterated word of God and that is the truth you see you cha spell amen they all write until they disagree with the word of God Amen so you can rely on your five senses amen you can rely on your spirit amen as long as it doesn't disagree with the word of God but amen once it starts to disagree with the word of God once you start to say I'm feeling too sick to go to church today amen starts to disagree with the word of God because the word of God says forsake not the assembling of the ascent of the Saints amen it starts to disagree with the word of God that's when you put your senses aside that's when you put your feelings aside amen amen amen you take the word of God amen my imaginations conscience memories reasons and affections they're all all right until they agree with the word amen but if fiction doesn't agree with the word get rid of it amen the prophet is you'll blow up the fluke right quick yes amen if your reason disagrees with the word get away from it amen now the prophet goes on to say a man that when God is placing his soldiers amen he's placing his soldiers now in the battlefield and it's just like how God placed the great solar system amen the prophet says that whichever planets God placed there and the stars that he placed there it's still there till this day standing at his post of Duty amen and the prophet Likens it unto God's soldiers standing there they post of Duty even the prophet says that's how we need to be standing at our post of Duty amen and we don't move until God says move amen we just stay there our post of Duty amen God set the stars in order and said hang there until I call you amen they stay there and nothing's going to move them amen and when God can get a man in his hands amen until he can get the senses amen the conscience and everything cleaned out and until it stands with God behind in the spirit then there's not a devil in the world that can poke one word of doubt in there amen when God gets a man in his hand amen amen and the prophet says that the mind is the Gate of the spirit [Music] amen so your mind is the gates Amen to the spirit so whatever you infiltrate in your mind whatever you input into your mind remember that's the gate to the spirit amen so if you put a whole lot of fruit in your mind yes you're gonna have a whole lot of food in your spirit amen but if you fill your mind with the things of God Amen the spirit is going to be well fed amen it's like these two dogs the prophet said whichever you feed the most is going to win the battle amen and your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit amen you can tonight say amen I accept the Holy Ghost into my life and you can receive the Holy Ghost into your life or you can reject it you can reject the word coming from the pulpit amen and then you'll reject life because God projects life from the pulpit amen that's how he's ordained it amen amen the prophet says you can have all of these little feelings and Sensations amen but it has nothing to do with it when the reality comes amen and your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it amen and the prophet says God let none of them miss it why because if you reject it amen you're rejecting basically the spirit of God Amen you cannot receive the spirit of God until you accept it amen so we see that the battle amen has been raging on and we said that in the beginning Satan came to Eve amen and he tried to deceive her in her mind and he tried to change and make a reason with the word of God amen and we know that he's done the same in the end time when you see the church world Amen they have reason to the word of God and they began to add their own ideas amen they began to add their own thinking to the word of God another word and the power of God is none effect to them why because Satan has been defeated in their minds amen and the prophet says but God's Gods give God's word the first place amen the prophet says a man can't sin a man cannot sin until first he cast aside God's word amen you cannot fall in sin until you constantly said God's word amen until you decide in your mind to say that I am going to ignore God's word and you willfully say you know I'm going to ignore what God said about this the prophecy is a man cannot sin until he first cast aside God's word amen amen and we know sin is to disbelieve until first he gets rid of the word of God and the presence of God he cannot sin amen so the prophet said we must just accept God's word Amen on the basis we accept his word on the basis that God said so amen we don't accept his word on the basis that we're going to see a result tomorrow Amen on the basis that we are going to see it come to pass tomorrow but we accept it on the basis that God said so like Abraham amen the prophet always dramatized it and he said Abraham would have asked Sarah amen how are you feeling today honey and when you're feeling any different and said I would say no I'm not feeling any different today but Abraham would say Amen praise God we're going to have the baby anyway amen why because he accepted God on the basis that God said so amen he accepted the word on the basis that God promised it and it must come to pass amen amen it doesn't matter what the doctor says it doesn't matter what anyone else says amen God said so amen and God's word is above all things yes amen and God said amen I wish above all the things that I would Prosper amen amen for good health so the prophet is teaching us here and he says we've got to amen we've got to look at these channels and make sure that they are opened up don't just bypass them amen he says that if Satan can get through there if he can get by these conscience and all these other things and he gets right down here to the end of the soul in the mind and now he can just get you you'll never look at one of them until you first have to let him in here you have to let him in and that's when he gets you he gets into control amen and then what he does he begins to use the conscience amen so when he begins when Satan gets a hold of your soul and he's in the control tower now he starts to use all your senses he starts to use your conscience he starts to use your memory he starts to use your reasoning amen so if you ever find yourself reasoning with God's word you got to watch and make sure that the enemy is not in the control tower amen he is you gotta cast him out amen amen and bring God back in amen bring the Holy Spirit back in amen when you start to listen to all these other senses amen start to take self-introspection amen and cast the enemy out amen amen and when Satan walked up to Eve amen he said you know the fruit is Pleasant she stopped for a moment and the prophet says that's where she made a mistake amen he says don't stop for nothing amen you got the message of the hour Jesus Lives amen God is the Healer he has the message don't stop for nothing amen no reasons nor anything else amen but she stopped for a moment and that's when Satan walked right into the Mind amen don't stop for nothing amen when you come across all these you young people amen I believe this message will also been live streamed or recorded you young people when you start to see all these YouTube videos about people who left the message and people now want to give their reasons of why they left the message if you left the message then just stay away if this is not the truth I don't understand why you got to waste your time coming on YouTube and posting a video about it no one cares amen but you young people don't stop to watch all of those nonsense amen because the moment you stop you're giving the enemy a room to work amen amen don't stop to listen to those reasoning if you are not sure about this message of the hour don't go to anyone else except go to your knees to you amen don't even go Amen to someone to talk to amen go to your knees and take me to the Lord in prayer amen amen don't give the devil room to work amen we know that we are remember we're talking about the Mind age we're talking about this greatest battle that is fought in the mind age and I believe our young people amen they are living in one of the most difficult age because with all of these mediums it's so easy for them to be influenced amen it's so easy for other people to influence their minds amen that is why they're going to be prepared for this battle amen and that is why we're going to keep them in Freya yes we gotta hold them up and parents you've got to hold your children up amen because they are facing these demon powers amen amen and these demon powers want to get a hold of their mind I want to influence them I want to give them all kinds of ideas amen you've got on one end you've got the atheist world who wants to show them amen the evolution process and they want to show them the Big Bang Theory and they want to show them how there's proof that there's no God and then on the other hand you get people who have left the message and I want to show them why this message is not the truth amen they're facing all of these demon powers amen but we have the word of God Amen and we're going to stand with the word of God our young people amen why because they are the ones that are going to be caring amen the Batson Amen to the to the to this last race Amen to the Finish Line amen amen so the devil can try all he wants but the Bible says that this bride will not be deceived amen amen hallelujah so Eve stopped for a moment but this bride will not stop amen this bride will continue in the word and he said the prophet says when you get this battle set in a ray the devil is sitting right at every heart amen he says this morning we can say that tonight the devil is setting right in every heart and he's sitting at your hearts he's sitting all around there and he's saying oh I seen your tribe before I heard that before amen Sprint all kind of doubts in your mind amen even when the preacher is preaching he's putting all kind of thoughts in your mind but remember I said there's a difference between a thought and your thoughts amen reject him tonight amen amen no matter what he says reject him amen amen the prophecies cast him out amen why the Bible gave you the power to cast him out so why not cast him out amen we've been trained amen the prophet says and the prophet says what's the matter with our speeches I wonder what kind of training we had God is training us for this great battle in Matthew 24 said and Daniel also said there would be a time of trouble such as never like on the earth before and we're living in that time when culture and here's what we are talking about just now all of these demon powers that we face in when culture and education and things are smothered over the word of God and got into reasonings and so forth the battle is now amen and the prophecies who will stand amen can we testify that we will stand amen can we testify that we will not be defeated amen but we will fight this battle amen amen amen the battle is ready to go in and she's in a Reign now and look at what a great opposition we got Yonder but God's Army is moving forward amen Men of Valor the prophet says men of Faith men of power men of understanding amen they don't have to be smart they don't have to be educated they have to be channels amen are we the channels of God tonight amen the God has to take a hold of those little channels amen amen the prophet says well if I could feel it if I'd feel the glory of God falling prophecies there has nothing to do with it amen like we said in the beginning of the service amen we don't have to feel a sensation to know that he is yeah amen he's promised to be here amen and if we believe it he is yeah yes amen and the prophet we know that the ministering Angel is here amen because God sends his ministry and Spirits to minister unto the church amen so we know he's here the focus is open up that mind that's the Battleground days where the battle sets in a rain amen open it up and say every doubt I doubt my doubts amen you gotta doubt your doubts amen amen I'm believing God's word yes amen you got to say here I come Satan something is going to take place amen amen you gotta come out from amongst your people like Abraham amen and the thing of is it they all of these peoples are doubters and unbelievers and Abraham had to separate himself from all of these people amen just like we've got to separate ourselves now from all of the doubters amen how can amen we be having fellowship with people of no faith people who don't believe because very soon that spirit is going to get amongst us amen okay so now we know that we are living in this great mind age amen the prophet there is this great scientific age amen we are great men like Albert Einstein amen and if you look at it as great as people like Albert Einstein and all of these great scientists were if you look at how advanced the age is gone now any common University student who studied in the same field is just as good as those great math why because they're not through books and whatever they have done whatever science is like Albert Einstein and all has done now these University students just really learn it in a four-year degree something that they took their whole life to figure out something that they worked hard night and day to try and invent to try and uh discover and figure out all it takes is a four-year college degree now to learn those things in fact you don't even need a college degree anymore because now you have something like YouTube that can teach you almost anything if you don't have any expertise in something all you have to do is go look up a quick 10 minute video on how to do something and you'll learn how to do it while we're living in this great mind age amen it's so Advanced now that you know do you know that Albert Einstein did not use a cell phone a cell phone wasn't invented in that time but yet now we have children who don't even know how to sing a full sentence together that knows how to use a cell phone I know this because she kind of knows how to use a cell phone why because we are living in this great minded and you find people saying hey babies actually are so advanced but it's true because we are living in this kind of an age where everything is Advanced knowledge is increased we read it in the opening scripture in Daniel it says knowledge shall be increased in those days and we are living in those days and that's in the natural world now we look in the spiritual world and we see our knowledge has increased you cannot have in the denominational world you cannot be a pastor unless you have a certain degree you have a certain qualification from Bible School amen they are so Advanced they're so amen they learn all different kinds uh types of translations and the Greek and all of these different translations and it's no coincidence that Satan has introduced this in the most intellectual mind age because at the same time that this that Satan has done this God in God's kingdom the mind of Christ has come down and the intelligence has come down in this last day so on the one hand you've got Seasons Kingdom which is increased in knowledge advanced in knowledge and in God's kingdom you've got the mind of Christ that has come down in the end time amen you got amen the prophet could come and say this morning I'm going to take you way back into the back parts of God's mind amen amen why it's because this Battleground that has been created amen remember we said these two Powers God's power and Satan's power fighting for the Mind amen so Satan as Satan is trying to set his Battlefield by getting this greatest intellectual age but God at the same time he's setting up his Battlefield amen by introducing the mind of Christ the very mind of God to be placed in his people amen amen hallelujah amen this great Battlefield is being set amen amen and that that is why the bride then the prophet could say that the bride can say she knows what what he wants done with his word amen why because she has the mind of Christ amen and we see that this is the climax now we know this is the last time that this battle will be fought amen and Satan has blocked this intellectual mind age to entice you and Captivate your mind and God is brought down his mind to capture those that are his amen amen he came fishing for the rainbow trout amen amen hallelujah amen but you've got to make the choice who to accept yes amen do you accept Satan amen with his this great intellectual age now remember when we say accept Satan we don't mean literally you're going up to Satan himself and you're accepting him but when you accept this age when you accept the spirit of this eight and the things that goes with it you accepting Satan amen or do you accept God Amen do you accept the mind of Christ and you can only accept the mind of Christ if you accept the message of the hour amen amen because the message of the hour is the mind of Flesh that is being expressed out amen amen amen so but we know we have chosen amen we've made our decision we've accepted the word of God amen amen and we've let it drop down in our soul we've let it clear out the channels that God can work through US amen okay so the prophet says that you know you only look at the condition of the church amen we we the church is in this great battle now and the prophet says if you want to look at the condition of the church you got to look at the woman correct and now we always use this and we say you know look at how the denomination Church yes because we can see the condition of the woman they're not dressed right they don't acknowledge a man Authority they're preaching and all of these things and that's great that's uh very well and good amen we can see what the condition of that church is but doesn't it apply also to us in the bride where we say if you want to see what the condition of the message said is we're going to look at the woman because the prophet says if you want to look at the church you look at the woman amen so we're going to look at ourselves now in this great battle amen we got to look at what the condition of the woman I in the message amen are the woman in the message on fire for God amen we're gonna see uh are they the same as they were back in the days of the Prophet when you had this great Trail Warriors woman that could pray amen women remember women are not allowed to preach in the church right and that is as much as we know from the word of God Amen but his sister is not prevented from saying amen amen a sister is not prevented from shouting hallelujah amen amen we know a sister is not prevented from worshiping God and singing out aloud in the church or giving testimonies or amen or praying amen all we know is that she's not allowed to preach the word and she's got a reverence her husband as a Lord amen we know that that much is true but amen but when we look at the condition of the uh of the woman in the church in the denomination we see that they have despised Authority amen we say they have rejected the word of God so we know that that church has rejected the word of God amen but in the message now amen do we have the woman of Faith like we had amen the cinema woman of this day amen you know the prophet spoke about the cinema woman of this day who said Lord I am your woman where is your Elijah yes amen she was so connected with a prayer and in faith to God it was so effective that she could ground the plane amen a big gigantic plane she could ground just by her prayer amen just by our faith amen not only that her signal was so strong she was able to send out a GPS signal Amen to direct the profit amen she sent out a live location amen amen you thought Google Maps invented sharing of a live location amen but yes she was yeah her signal was so strong amen that that person amen began to be sent to the prophet amen and then the spirit of God could tell the prophet amen keep walking amen I can imagine how the prophet must have been walking and that GPS must have been said okay tell him right here amen and as the prophet was walking he says turn left yeah amen keep walking keep walking why all because a sister was so connected to our God Amen all because she had so much of Faith amen amen that she was able to send her that signal amen and amen the prophet was led right to her doorstep amen amen and she was not hoping she was standing there at the doorstep waiting for him to come amen why she knew he was on his way she had that kind of a faith hallelujah amen and the prophet amen the prophet said you pray first and when she began to pray the prophet said when she began to pray I first revived amen hallelujah amen do we have the same kind of woman in the church tonight amen amen how many encouraged his sisters tonight amen to be a good like TD Jakes tonight amen to say women lose amen because for too long in the message I believe we've been hindering the sisters amen by trying to put them down and make them feel like a doormat amen the Bible only said you cannot preach and the Bible only says you're going to respect your husband but other than that you're an equal basis amen because you are you yourself have to receive the Holy Ghost and if you receive the Holy Ghost you are born born again full with the spirit of God Amen so you will react the same way a brother does because it's the same kind of a holy spirit amen it's not going to make a brother act in one way and a sister act in a different way no sir amen it's the same kind of a spirit yes amen that is why amen sometimes amen when the wife at home amen if she begins to pray if she begins to read the word or listen to the tape amen the husband now begin to feel condemned amen you begin to say you know I'm the head of the house if she can do it why shouldn't I amen should begin to revive the husband and then the sermon can look at what she is doing amen and they begin to get influenced amen hallelujah amen and that is why amen even with Mary amen she might have raised Jesus amen she might have been amen the woman that raised Jesus from a baby but Amen on the day of Pentecost the prophet says she too had to receive the Holy Ghost and when Mary received the Holy Ghost she started to stagger like a drunk person as well amen just as much as Pizza amen she said in the speaking tongues just as well how many of you know that in the prophet's days a lot of the sisters used to speak in tongues you get on the tapes amen hallelujah amen now you think I'm only talking about the sisters but remember I said if you watch the condition of the sisters you see the condition of the church amen hallelujah so I'm actually talking about the church tonight amen we if our sisters has the power of God then the church has the power of God if the sisters are powerless in the church then the church is powerless amen hallelujah so let's encourage the sisters tonight amen let's encourage the brothers amen amen let's encourage the young ones yes amen because why when we all comfortably frame together come and standing at our host of gypsy amen the young ones come come in and add your life to the church add in your youthfulness to the church amen the brothers come in and add in your boldness to the church add in your Vigor for God Amen the sisters come in and add in your spirit to the church add in your humbleness to the church adding the characteristics that God bless you where Amen to the church then the church starts to operate together amen hallelujah amen the prophet spoke of great women of his day amen how many have you know this this Prophet spoke of anti-writes Amen who was able to agree with the word of God Amen when she agreed with the word of God it began to activate the third full ministry amen not a brother but a sister amen hallelujah yes so we see amen that the church is in about condition getting ready Amen to fight this Great War amen and the enemy is trying all of his remember the prophet says the enemy has one last blow amen and he's entitled to that one last blow amen and no doubt the enemy is not the enemy is a strategic fighter he's not just gonna take that blood any time he's gonna wait for you to be at your weakest amen he's gonna wait for you when is the right opportune time because the devil is an opportunist amen he's gonna try with that last blow because he knows after the last blow he has nothing left amen but how many of you know that that even the last blow is nothing but a lie because the Bible says amen we are more than conquerors to Christ Jesus amen Christ who defeat the enemy on the trust amen hallelujah amen amen you're still with me you blessed tonight amen you're ready to fight this battle amen you ready to press on the mark of perfection amen we know we have a little while left amen but the enemy is trying amen he's trying to get us down he's trying it's all of his tactics whether it's through work whether it's to the families whether it's true the world is trying amen but the enemy is a liar amen yes you just skip some notes now others I'm Gonna Keep you here the whole night amen prophecies I I thought of the order of the Heavenly hosts talking once again about the solar system and that one of them is out of place everyone keeps its time perfectly God's Great and God's Great Army I thought of the soldiers how that if that Moon would happen to get out of order the Earth would be covered again with WhatsApp just in a few minutes the Earth would be just like it was void and darkness and whatso was upon the breath of the like that has to keep its place everything gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cancer how it's important amen you might think now that you staying at home and it's not affecting the church but then everyone we should continually just we should continue to strive to keep the order of the spirit amen and I went to God this tree Harmony that the Holy Spirit would place every member of the body that's if we just hold our position okay that Dr Holbrook was going to take off took the cancer without even leaving his car don't you know that the same God position amen amen like the stars getting their position oh Hallelujah we want to see amen a Revival of god let's get into our position amen amen God is calling every Seed of Abraham this morning amen are we the Seed of Abraham to that same kind of a life amen The Great Battle Is Over Now worldwide God wants his children the sea the the sensation amen the prophet likened it like with that little bird that's in the end the prophet says that there's only one way for that bird to get out of that egg shell is for it to pick its way amen amen now it might be afraid to get out of the eggshell he doesn't know what's on the outside amen all it knows is what's in that shell but it needs to keep on talking until the child lets it out it doesn't matter what voices of fear or doubt it hears or it doesn't matter how much they say there is no more Supernatural it doesn't matter how much they say there is no more helium it doesn't matter how much they say that the circumstances cannot change you have to just keep on picking out of that shell that circumstance that you're in that situation that you're in amen the prophecies with the dusted of the Lord here amen maybe with a little Hebrews 13 8 amen you just keep packing your way out of that condition amen with a little ax anything in my name you keep pecking your way out of that position amen amen and by the way let me tell you something that mama bird amen cannot break that shell from the outside because if it does so it will kill the bird amen the shell is just meant to be that temporary situation but that little bird has to pick itself out of the shell and the prophet says he never goes back to that shall again amen once that bird breaks out of that shell amen he's free oh my the word once it gets sent down to all these senses and Consciousness amen and things to get settled down here and the mind opens up and lets it in Prophet says oh God have mercy there's never nothing to bondage it again amen and that is why the church should not be on the bondage tonight amen because we have broken our way out of the shells of this denominations amen amen and the word of God has settled in our hearts so there should not be any bondage amongst us amen there should not be anything hindering us from serving God amen hallelujah amen your denomination can never call you back the prophet says amen the devil could never do anything more to you amen so what's the matter with all these people that left the message amen the word never settled in their souls amen Hallelujah amen the prophet says and it's not what the size of the dog that counts amen but it's the size of the fight in the dog that counts amen he says if you're a coward then get back and cuddle in your hole but brother if you're a soldier amen stand out there there's a battle going on Amen right around the prophet says the battle is engaged let's fight amen hallelujah amen I like the story that the prophet tells about pizza Cartwright Pizza Cartwright God told him to go down into a certain place and I'm not going to read the whole story it's quite long so I'm just going to paraphrase it the prophet tells him to go down into uh sorry God tells Peter Cabra to go down into a certain place and have a Revival service so he goes down and I think he gets a place and he starts to clean the place up so in this town There's this bully amen Prophet that I don't think the prophet gives his name but there's this big guy and he walks around with his pistol and he hears that piece of cartridge wants to have a Revival in this place so now this bully wants to go and tell Peter Conrad you can't have a Revival here so he goes up to Peter Cartwright and tells them you can't have a Revival yeah I run this place and he tells pizza cut right if you want to have a Revival here you're gonna have to go through me first so Pizza can't write amen he was in the Battleground amen he know God commissioned him to be there so Pizza Cartwright why is wiping the windows he says okay if I have to go through you next then that's what I'll do next amen Pete the prophecies Pizza Company got down of the chair and he punched this guy to the floor and beats him up and he says amen now I can go on preaching amen I can go on with the mission of God Amen so the prophet says we're gonna be like that amen when the enemy wants to come and put us down and bury us down amen we've got a mission of God Amen we've got to slay every demon amen we've got to fight amen but don't fight the devil on his grounds amen you've got to bring the war image your grounds to God's grounds amen if you try to fight the devil and he's done he's gonna whoop you every time amen like Nelly Sanders amen you know the story of Nelly Sanders the prophet said amen she stopped by that dancing place amen and she just stopped to hear the music she was not in the devil's grounds amen and the D and the enemy had her whipped amen but the prophet says just keep going amen keep chopping with the sword the word of God and he says Don't Stop like when the prophet said to him he said take my stuff and lay it on the child to recover amen he said don't stop for no money if someone greets you on the side don't stop and read them just keep on running with the stuff amen and that's how we're gonna run with the message of God Amen don't stop to anyone amen don't stop to greet any demon amen you just keep running with the message amen hallelujah when you just believe amen one word of God you are disarmed amen you are no longer armed amen hallelujah amen we gotta get ready amen get rid of all the all of these things that are blocking the channels amen amen how many of you know that when the angel of the Lord told the prophet something amen the devil's the word of God amen I'm not talking about now in the prophet maybe studied something and made a prediction or something like I'm sorry when the angel of the Lord told the prophet to do something it was the word of God Amen you believe that amen but so when the angel told the prophet not to have television amen why do we still have it the word of God isn't it amen the angel of the god the angel of the Lord told the prophet not to have it amen but we are fighting on the enemy's ground we are coming on the enemy stuff we allow in all of these things to come into our home and now the sword is cutting both ways because I'm preaching to myself as well amen we allow the enemies to come into our homes we allow him to infiltrate our minds we are lying to shape our minds by all of these things that we watch amen begin to be desensitized to the presence of God why because we are watching the filth of the world doesn't matter what we are watching now the brother the angel of the Lord told him don't have television period amen you never say okay have television watch this don't watch this period don't have television amen but we allow these things to come into our homes amen and then now we want to wonder why amen the spirit of God doesn't move when we come to church on a Sunday we come to church on a Wednesday amen the ninth spiritual gifts as we've been preaching these last few weeks are not operating why because the prophet says that channels are not cleared up amen the word of God was supposed to be in the soul supposed to be projected on the soul write out fun Amen to the outside supposed to be manifesting the power of God suppose we manifest in the works of God because the Bible says these Saints shall follow them that believe the Bible says the words that I do shall give you also that either the word of God or is not the word of God and if it's the word of God it must be in effect and the only time it will not be effect if we are not right amen I think many times the problem is we schedule much may be wrong but we don't want gen between me wrong amen we want to how uh whatever we want in later this year we want to indulge a little bit in leaders here we want to have a little bit of this a little bit of that and then we still want to have the presence of God and it doesn't work that way because like I said in the beginning you cannot have 10 doubt and 90 Faith you can only have 100 Faith or 100 doubt amen and there's no such thing amen as watching a decent family movie anymore it maybe could be possible a few years ago amen because everything you watch now has a homosexual couple in it that's correct amen everything you watch now has something to do that's against the word of God there's no such thing as a decent thing to watch anymore amen amen so hey man I'm not done with this demon yes amen let's deal with this demon tonight amen amen in the army of Israel when they were at War yeah amen Joshua was victorious in every battle amen amen from the time that Moses left Joshua's victories in every battle until Aiken took up the accuracy that's nice amen and in this message amen the ministers that have gone by amen they started to fight victoriously after the prophet left they started to uphold the message amen they started to win every battle amen they started to be victorious but somewhere along the line we begin to touch on the accurate thing we begin to start to take the things of the world and bring it into the camp of the Lord amen and that is why now we cannot have the victory because there's Aikens in our camp amen and when I say Akins in our camp something that can be ourselves as well amen but now we've got to get rid of those things amen how long is it going to be until we say it's time to call a sovereign assembly and when I say something is not righteous we need to see the moon of God In This Place amen and something is not right and maybe we are the problem amen what is the problem we need to get cleared out we need to clear out the channels and let the word of God settle in our soul and when the word of God is settled in our soul we cannot digest any anything else amen you cannot feed on anything else amen and it's not just television we're letting all other aspects of the world into our homes amen whether it be amen with all of these hairstyles amen used to be a man that uh when we when I first came in the message I know things were quite strict day man but in these days like living in the message is easy amen there's no strictness there's no uh like a certain level to keep I know when I first came the message you know it was like a level you keep in you know you're living at such a level but why is it becoming so easy to live in the message we listen on the bar slowly we let you down the bars amen and God cannot work amongst us amen we've been preaching for the last few weeks amen about the about the gifts starting to operate again about God's power moving again but amen when are we gonna start taking action amen it's good to hear it in a sermon but when we're gonna start taking action amen when are we going to begin to fast and pray again when we go we're going to begin Amen to have those online prayer meetings again amen amen maybe the brothers get together and go out to the beach amen start to have a testimony night so that you have a prayer nights again amen amen it can only have stopped back in that day amen we can do it today Nothing Stops us from doing it again maybe we need to try something different throw in a few extra Services amen we got to do something different if we want to change the position that we are in amen we can't just come in weekend with the same kind of tradition amen just come to church you're in a sermon and there's nothing wrong with your sermons don't get me wrong the word of God is being treated directly the word of God is being preached truly amen but if we don't do anything about it then it's nothing but a sermon amen hallelujah but how many of you tonight want to clear out the channels amen how many of you want to get rid of all of these demon Spirits in our homes amen amen these demon spirits that we are allowing to infiltrate our children amen and remember even these little ones amen they get accustomed to watching all of these cartoons and there might be nothing wrong with the cartoons but as they grow big now you gotten them accustomed to watching TV so as they get bigger they want to watch other things and now you want to stop them from watching television but they say but you was making me watch television all along what's the difference now why are we getting them accustomed to all the wrong things and that is why now they can't even read you know in in in I'll say the olden days but perhaps when I was small as well children who used to actually read books yeah how many children read books these days I'm not talking about the message now I'm talking about books in general don't read books anymore because they have a television to visually display the info information to their Royal phone YouTube Etc but how many of you know that as much as those screens are feeding your information it's killing your brain cells in the natural it's scientifically proven it's scientifically proven there is much more educational to listen to a radio station where you're not looking at it visually then watching television because when you're watching television your brain doesn't have to do anything the visual aspect is already giving you the interpretation of the information whereas when you listen to a radio station or something your imagination is to imagine it so your brain has been stimulated the same when you're reading now you have to imagine it so your brain is being stimulated so in the natural their brain cells are being killed now what about the spiritual because they feed in on garbage so their spiritual brain cells bear in mind that the mind is where the Battleground is the spiritual minds are being destroyed all because we are letting them be destroyed amen but let's change that tonight amen let's get rid of the accursed things in our homes let's get rid of their cursed things in our lives at work amen let's be a testimony let the word of God settle in our hearts and manifest out amen hallelujah amen you bless tonight amen we fight in this battle amen we slain every demon amen we're taking the word of God and we slain every demon every week amen hallelujah amen you blessed tonight amen amen you you are you glad amen that God never just leave us in this battlefield but he gave us the weapon sword of the word he gave us the old Armor of God he gave us protection amen not only that he's already given us the victory amen and he's made us more than conquerors amen let's Stand Together Hallelujah [Applause] amen oh we are Overcomers we have more than conquerors amen the enemy had us whooped for a long time amen yes Amen to amen lazy in leadership amen he tried to entice us with many things amen he has our mind he had our minds whipped amen but tonight that's gonna change we're gonna stand as soldiers in our position amen we're going to stand as true soldiers of God Amen like the solar system that stands in its place amen for a purpose of God we're going to stand in our position and we're going to slay every demon amen hallelujah amen I'm going to call apostate forward amen hallelujah sing and worship him amen God bless you all amen [Music] amen God bless you amen you appreciate the word of the Lord amen amen the greatest battle ever fought amen hallelujah amen the Bible won't stop until we are out of this place amen we gotta fight for every inch of ground you know the there was the Indian man or an Indian man and he spoke about the black dog and the white dog and they asked him which dog wins the fight he said inside of me there's a black dog and there's a white dog he said which one wins he says the one that you feed the most amen amen how about we stop the black dog and let the white dog win amen hallelujah let's just sing and Worship the Lord amen that's the name of Jesus [Music] I want to live the way that he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love [Music] just know I could never ever [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] lived even as the word of the Lord came tonight amen hallelujah reminding us to God our minds amen because there's a battle going on for your mind amen Hallelujah that was the Battleground that was chosen amen so if we know where the Battleground is and if you know how Satan is working in this time amen then we should be able to guard our minds Amen to feed on the word of God hallelujah not just feed on a Sunday or on a Wednesday but feed every day amen to read our Bibles and pray amen that's what our duty is that's what our responsibility is Amen to read the Bible and pray every day commit our ways to the Lord amen the best way to have a Revival is to pray every day and read your Bible amen hallelujah amen if each one of us can make that solemn confession to the Lord to say Lord I want to draw closer to you and every day in our homes start to have a Revival amen start to pray in our homes we'll begin we see a change in our homes amen and when families are changed amen the church can be changed hallelujah amen let's just try life to enter in to that Mark of perfection if you want to be remembered in prayer tonight you can raise your hand amen and the Lord will be able to meet you at the point of your need amen remembering the prayer requests of those that are unwell maybe you'll come to church

can meet you at the point of view with every bow that everyone has closed let's approach the throne of grace and mercy and believe that the Lord is going to meet us at our point of need now amen we can ask for brother Joshua to close the service and prayer amen foreign we must be a region yes Lord because a lot of videos is better than sacrifice Hallelujah and Lord if the spirit is speaking it
