[3:51] amen amen hallelujah amen isn't he
[3:54] worthy of Praise amen let's turn to the
[3:58] Book of Numbers
[4:00] amen
[4:02] Book of Numbers Chapter 20 and verse 8.
[4:14] bless the name of Jesus
[4:18] amen
[4:20] [Music]
[4:21] so from verse 7 it says and the Lord
[4:23] spake unto Moses saying
[4:26] take the take the rod
[4:28] and gather down the assembly together
[4:31] thou and Aaron thy brother
[4:34] notice now it's not the prophet alone
[4:37] the priesthood must accompany the
[4:38] prophet
[4:40] amen
[4:41] and speak he unto the rock before their
[4:45] eyes
[4:47] and it shall give forth his water
[4:52] notice how he personalizes them the rock
[4:55] shall give forth his water
[4:57] amen and thou shalt bring forth to them
[5:00] water out of the Rock
[5:04] so Thou shalt give the congregation and

[5:08] amen you may be seated the Lord
[5:10] blessings should reading of his word
[5:13] amen
[5:17] Hallelujah
[5:19] amen let's turn to Mark chapter 6 Mark
[5:22] chapter 11.
[5:29] I'm going to give it context from verses
[5:31] 12
[5:35] and on the moral when they will come
[5:37] from Bethany
[5:39] he was hungry that's our lord Jesus
[5:43] amen
[5:44] our lord Jesus was hungry
[5:49] and seeing a fig tree afar of having
[5:51] leaves he came
[5:53] if happy he might find another thing
[5:55] there on and when he came to it he found
[5:57] nothing but leaves for the time of figs
[6:00] was not yet
[6:03] amen
[6:06] what is that telling you
[6:08] season
[6:11] but God is asking us to be instant in
[6:13] season
[6:14] and out of season
[6:18] if he is going to use you in this hour
[6:21] you need to be bearing fruit
[6:23] at all times
[6:26] amen if he comes to your tree to your
[6:29] Vine
[6:30] and he sees no fruit on the tree
[6:33] don't let him speak to you
[6:36] but let him find fruit on your tree amen
[6:39] because
[6:41] Jesus answered
[6:43] and said unto it no man eat fruit of the
[6:45] year after forever
[6:47] and his disciples heard it so they heard
[6:50] the spoken word
[6:53] now this was Jesus coming to the third
[6:55] pool of his ministry
[6:57] amen the spoken word
[7:00] now notice there it's not seasoned and
[7:03] that's what they will tell us in the
[7:04] message of the hour right now
[7:08] it's not seasoned yet for the third pool
[7:11] but Jesus is standing historical
[7:13] Ministry and he's telling you it ought
[7:14] to be seasoned amen
[7:19] amen
[7:21] Hallelujah
[7:23] now watch from verse 15 to 70 is to
[7:27] verse 19 it's a hidden Mystery there
[7:30] because he's going to cleanse the temple
[7:37] amen you want to read it let's read it
[7:40] and they came out to Jerusalem Jesus
[7:42] went into the temple sorry I might be
[7:44] able to broken up here because the Lord
[7:46] just changed my entire message coming to
[7:47] church
[7:49] so I may not have everything that's why
[7:50] I do not even have a slideshow
[7:52] amen you know when the Holy Spirit just
[7:54] comes in and tells you don't touch that
[7:57] take this because I was going to speak
[7:59] on Mark 11 23 and take it from there but
[8:02] you notice my opening scripture was
[8:03] Numbers Chapter 20. amen I'll tell you
[8:06] why just now amen
[8:09] so they come into the temple and they
[8:11] find Money Changes
[8:13] amen but Jesus went to the temple and
[8:15] began to cast out them that sold and
[8:18] bought in the temple and overthrew the
[8:20] tables of the money changes and the
[8:23] seats of them that sold out
[8:25] you know that's the type of the Holy
[8:27] Spirit does
[8:29] amen
[8:30] if you're going to most churches today
[8:32] and they're exchanging money
[8:35] amen are they selling the spirit of God
[8:39] aren't they telling you to come
[8:41] amen
[8:43] and would not suffer that any man should
[8:45] carry any vessel through the temple
[8:48] and he taught them saying is it not
[8:51] written my house
[8:53] Shall be Called of all Nations the house
[8:55] of what
[8:57] amen amen amen
[9:00] catch the hidden Mystery there now
[9:03] where's the house of God today amen
[9:07] amen Where's the temple of God
[9:10] so before he goes back he just power the
[9:13] spoken word but before the disciples can
[9:16] see the evidence they are seeing a
[9:18] cleansing of the Temple
[9:20] amen amen this he's showing them how to
[9:23] dedicate the temple
[9:25] how to operate in the power of the
[9:27] spoken word amen
[9:29] amen oh I wish I had this in my nose how
[9:31] it sounds good amen how to operate in
[9:34] the power of the spoken word amen amen
[9:36] get back to prayer for my house my
[9:39] temple shall be called a House of Prayer
[9:41] amen yes
[9:43] amen but you have made it a den of
[9:46] Thieves
[9:49] so a thousand dollars
[9:51] connect with the anointing
[9:53] we say come by without money amen yes
[9:56] amen hallelujah the gospel is to be
[10:00] given freely amen
[10:03] but people don't want to bear the cost
[10:05] of the anointing
[10:08] the anointing will cost you everything
[10:10] amen amen amen and people do not want to
[10:14] elaborate those things but Jesus is
[10:16] telling you my house shall be called a
[10:18] House of Prayer but you have made it a
[10:20] den of Thieves
[10:22] even when people go down to pray they
[10:24] are thinking about money
[10:25] they are thinking about this that and
[10:27] the other
[10:29] they're trying to use the the prayer
[10:31] life to manipulate God
[10:36] amen
[10:37] and describes the chief scribes and
[10:40] chief priests heard it
[10:43] and sought how they might destroy him
[10:46] people do not like truth
[10:49] amen for they feared him because all the
[10:52] people was astonished at his Doctrine
[10:55] amen amen hallelujah amen they are going
[10:59] to come to see to destroy the bride in
[11:01] this time why the same way the tree to
[11:03] the groom is how they are going to treat
[11:05] the bride
[11:07] amen we speak things that uncover Satan
[11:11] scheme in this end time amen amen so
[11:14] what are they going to do they want to
[11:16] destroy us they're going to bring a
[11:18] squeeze amen
[11:20] but all the people who astonished at his
[11:23] Doctrine
[11:25] amen
[11:28] and when they even was come you went out
[11:30] of the city now the next morning coming
[11:33] back to the tree now as they passed by
[11:35] they saw the victory dried up from the
[11:37] roots
[11:40] amen
[11:43] they are witnessing the same one the
[11:46] spoke in Genesis chapter one Amen Let
[11:49] There Be amen
[11:50] and there was
[11:52] now he's in a body of Flesh
[11:56] and he spoke to that tree
[11:58] now ask yourself you in your Human
[12:00] Condition
[12:01] God has given you the ability
[12:04] to connect with the scripture amen but
[12:07] it requires certain things
[12:11] in order for you to come back to this
[12:13] academic condition
[12:16] amen you've got to align with God Amen
[12:19] amen you've got to align with his
[12:20] program
[12:21] we kind of come so far in the message
[12:26] after 30 40 years
[12:28] and we see no evidence of what the
[12:30] prophet spoke about
[12:33] there's going to be something wrong
[12:35] we can't be doing the same old things
[12:38] saying the same old things seeing no
[12:41] move of God and being content with it
[12:44] expecting different results
[12:46] people are wondering in the wilderness
[12:53] amen oh no leave us with our scribes and
[12:56] our Pharisees we love their teaching
[13:02] Jesus
[13:04] they had remember they had the law they
[13:06] had the ritual word
[13:08] but they had to come now to listen to
[13:10] the manifested words
[13:12] you are living in pistols where the Lord
[13:14] of all men
[13:15] amen
[13:16] people want to take you back and only
[13:19] point you back to history I am the
[13:21] manifested word
[13:25] the spirit of God is speaking out of you
[13:27] yeah
[13:29] you become co-workers with the holy
[13:31] spirit amen
[13:35] Hallelujah and you know it's always it
[13:39] looks like the manifested word is always
[13:41] against
[13:42] their religious thinking
[13:45] notice that in Scripture
[13:48] they were not happy with Moses being the
[13:50] deliverer
[13:51] they were not happy with Jesus being the
[13:53] deliverer
[13:55] neither will it be happy in the Third
[13:57] Exodus
[13:59] with whom God is chosen
[14:03] amen yes
[14:05] so the morning the next morning they
[14:07] passed to fig tree dried up from the
[14:09] roots and Peter calling to remembrance
[14:11] say that to them here's the rock now
[14:14] Peter
[14:15] called them to remembrance
[14:18] the others may have forgotten what was
[14:21] spoken
[14:24] but Peter
[14:26] The Rock Amen
[14:29] remembers what Jesus said
[14:32] amen there's only a few that will
[14:35] remember what Jesus said there's only a
[14:38] few that's looking for the manifestation
[14:39] of what Jesus said
[14:43] Master behold the Fig Tree which that
[14:45] curse is withered away
[14:48] and Jesus answered say that to him have
[14:51] faith in God
[14:53] amen amen
[14:57] now here's 11 23.

[15:01] know that but watch How It's

[15:12] the 23 means
[15:13] so why is it there
[15:16] and that's the title of my message
[15:18] our association with the angel of God
[15:21] Amen is 11 23.
[15:26] we are the 11th Hour workers
[15:30] but we have a special connection with
[15:33] the angel of the Lord in this hour

[15:40] some want to say take me back
[15:44] take me back dear Lord give me an
[15:47] history lesson please

[15:51] the place
[15:52] yeah if you want to see present tense
[15:54] realities present tense manifestation
[15:57] you'll find it here amen
[16:00] we are taking God out of History
[16:03] we know in Hebrews 13 8 but I don't want
[16:06] amen I don't want to only see me
[16:09] yesterday yes neither do I only want to
[16:12] hear about tomorrow
[16:14] he is today
[16:16] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[16:18] and forever
[16:22] some are not looking for the
[16:23] manifestation of today because it makes
[16:26] them uncomfortable
[16:28] amen
[16:30] who verily are saying to you that
[16:32] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[16:36] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[16:39] the sea thou shall not doubt in his

[16:49] what follows
[16:53] amen people get excited in the first
[16:56] part
[16:57] but they don't want to label for the
[16:59] second part

[18:00] one thing

[18:16] mentioned that super anointing Came Upon
[18:19] him
[18:20] amen he also mentions a few other things
[18:22] but if you caught it amen
[18:24] he's waiting for you to say the right
[18:26] word
[18:28] you notice it was we always talk about
[18:30] sister actually right said the right
[18:32] words

[19:11] those things which he had said shall
[19:13] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[19:17] saved
[19:19] amen amen
[19:21] amen whatsoever you saith amen
[19:24] hallelujah oh praise the name of Jesus
[19:27] so what is he saying there amen
[19:31] Jesus telling them my house shall be a
[19:33] House of Prayer amen
[19:36] we find that too many people
[19:40] are not living this
[19:43] amen
[19:46] does not brother Branham say
[19:51] you can eat too much
[19:53] you can drink too much
[19:56] you can talk too much what can't you do
[19:59] too much
[20:00] praying too much
[20:05] you can't pray too much
[20:09] now in Ephesians 4 and verse 30.
[20:14] if you read the scripture
[20:16] tells you
[20:18] not the Holy Spirit who is the Holy
[20:21] Spirit the angel of God Amen grieve not
[20:24] the Holy Spirit
[20:27] because you are sealed until the day of
[20:29] your Redemption
[20:31] do you know what that word grief means
[20:35] it means he Mourns
[20:37] he's in agony
[20:39] is in Trivial
[20:41] do you know what Grieves the Holy Spirit
[20:44] when you don't pray
[20:46] ask yourself what Grieves the Holy
[20:47] Spirit
[20:50] when you choose social media over your
[20:53] prayer times amen when you choose death
[20:56] or were you reading your the word
[20:59] now remember the word is first and
[21:01] foremost amen heavens and earth shall
[21:05] pass away but my word shall never pass
[21:07] away
[21:11] we have had the opening of the world
[21:15] we of all people
[21:17] having the most amount of Revelation in
[21:19] all the Earth
[21:21] amen ought to be the most powerful
[21:23] people
[21:27] there is great power that happens in
[21:29] prayer
[21:31] yes now there are two people
[21:34] that you can grieve
[21:37] you can grieve the Holy Spirit
[21:40] by neglecting the word
[21:42] and prayer
[21:46] because the Holy Spirit feeds on the
[21:48] word yeah amen
[21:50] and you know what the problem is you do
[21:53] not connect
[21:54] we know that prayer is a connection to
[21:57] God
[21:58] but really the holy spirit is in you
[22:02] you connect to God
[22:04] you pray because you have a connection
[22:06] with God that's what I'm trying to say
[22:07] you pray because of your connection with
[22:10] God
[22:11] you realize it's the axis
[22:14] didn't Jesus say
[22:16] in Matthew chapter 6.
[22:19] you'll find it I think in verse five
[22:21] he's teaching them how to pray
[22:25] how does it started Our Father who art
[22:28] in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[22:33] holy is your name
[22:35] you reverence the name of God when you
[22:37] approach him in prayer
[22:39] sometimes if you approach it and your
[22:42] mind is racing you need to steal
[22:43] yourself in his presence do not stop
[22:46] praying
[22:48] because your prayer is like empty things
[22:50] just falling flat hitting the ceiling
[22:52] coming down
[22:53] how many times you just want to have a
[22:55] quick five-minute prayer
[22:58] but our mind is racing with thoughts
[23:01] quiet yourself amen
[23:04] if you can't quiet yourself meditate on
[23:06] his word
[23:08] or start to worship
[23:10] change the atmosphere amen amen amen
[23:13] don't stand your spiritual growth but if
[23:15] you're going to commit your test time to
[23:17] prayer don't spend that that half an
[23:20] hour that one hour just aimlessly let it
[23:22] be effective prayer of a righteous man
[23:25] know how to operate in prayer amen
[23:28] amen silence the mind yes
[23:31] yes the flesh will tell you I need to do
[23:32] this I need to do that
[23:34] you bring the Flesh and the subjection
[23:38] yes
[23:39] amen don't keep your phone near you
[23:45] amen don't be irreverent in his presence
[23:49] thank you Lord amen so prayer connects
[23:52] you to God and then what does it tell
[23:55] you because the next one
[23:56] you need to put up the Lord's Prayer in
[23:58] Matthew chapter 6. foreign
[24:02] our father worked in heaven Hallowed be
[24:05] thy name worship Him
[24:07] approach God In Prayer by worship
[24:11] amen
[24:13] now here's the key
[24:16] thy kingdom come
[24:19] thy will be done
[24:22] why would God ask you to pray for his
[24:25] will to be done on Earth
[24:31] how many of you pray that way
[24:34] amen
[24:37] Hallelujah
[24:39] the purpose of prayer is so that you
[24:42] align yourself to the will of God
[24:46] amen amen
[24:48] the purpose of prayer is to bring Heaven
[24:50] to Earth
[24:51] that Kingdom Come
[24:54] bring your thoughts to Earth
[24:56] bring your will to Earth bring your
[24:58] purpose to Earth bring your plan to the
[25:01] end
[25:02] not just idiot to my Earth
[25:12] we are to manifest the kingdom of heaven
[25:15] amen yes
[25:17] amen Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven
[25:20] suffereth violence
[25:22] you think we are on a picnic
[25:25] if we can open up your eyes to the
[25:26] spiritual World you'll see the violence
[25:28] that's taking place
[25:30] demonic forces attacking the kingdom of
[25:32] God
[25:34] even right now
[25:35] distracting you from the things of God
[25:37] even right now being irreverent to the
[25:40] things of God
[25:42] even right now with doubts in your heart
[25:45] you sit there
[25:46] [Music]
[25:48] amen but that Kingdom Come
[25:52] thy will be done
[25:55] on Earth
[25:57] as it is in heaven amen amen hallelujah
[26:03] amen I want you to know the will of God
[26:07] is not you can change the mind of God
[26:10] you can't change the will of God
[26:13] that's why prayer is not for you to go
[26:15] and change the mind of God it's not for
[26:17] you to go and change the will of God
[26:19] pray
[26:20] you
[26:22] amen amen amen
[26:25] Lord I may have had all of this thing
[26:27] but align me to your will
[26:30] align me to your purpose
[26:33] amen
[26:35] so the will of God think of it like this
[26:37] River that's flowing
[26:39] can you change the river's flow
[26:42] can you alter the river
[26:46] what you need to do is to jump into the
[26:50] river
[26:51] and allow the flow to take you in his
[26:53] will
[26:54] amen go with the flow of the river
[26:57] and we singing Flow River flow amen
[27:02] what are we seeing Lord I want to be in
[27:04] your will yes
[27:06] yes amen
[27:10] amen so when we pray according to his
[27:13] will when we pray according to his word
[27:16] we are bringing creation into alignment
[27:18] with God's plan on the Earth
[27:21] and doesn't he say in the word that my
[27:23] ways are higher than your ways my
[27:25] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[27:27] so what are we saying that this bride
[27:29] that aligns with God's will is thinking
[27:32] higher thoughts as higher ways as high
[27:35] as standards amen
[27:37] amen
[27:39] amen praying is not to persuade to do
[27:42] God's son to do something that God
[27:44] doesn't want to do
[27:45] please Lord please do it this way no
[27:51] the Bible says that our best laid plans
[27:54] God laughs at it
[27:56] doesn't he say in Jeremiah that I know
[27:59] the plans I have for you
[28:02] so why we want to fight God's plan God's
[28:04] will of Our Lives
[28:06] Lord align me to your will amen amen
[28:10] I tell you people are not serious about
[28:12] prayer
[28:15] if you want to be a powerful Army raise
[28:17] up
[28:21] amen if you want to be a powerful Army
[28:25] you need to get alone with God
[28:30] you need to read his word
[28:32] if you want to know the will of God
[28:34] you read his word people say oh the holy
[28:37] spirit is not speaking to me
[28:40] when last would you open your Bible
[28:42] the holy spirit will never reveal
[28:44] anything outside of the word because the
[28:46] Holy Spirit was said to remind you of
[28:48] the word to teach you the word
[28:51] oh I don't hear the voice of the Holy
[28:53] Spirit when last did you open your Bible
[28:56] yes
[29:00] I opened it last week and my mother told
[29:02] me to complete 900 and note that was
[29:04] Sunday
[29:06] hey
[29:09] when last did you open your Bible
[29:13] when last did you carry your Bible to
[29:15] church
[29:17] are we proud of our Bible
[29:20] do we carry it as the word the sword of
[29:22] the Lord
[29:25] sword of the king
[29:28] oh why are you preaching such basic
[29:30] things it's the basic things that's left
[29:32] undone
[29:36] you need to reverence the word
[29:40] do you know how the Jews reverence the
[29:42] word
[29:45] amen
[29:47] so prayer is not to say Lord bend your
[29:49] will to my will
[29:51] pray is not to limit God's
[29:54] Vision a lie to your vision
[29:59] prayer is to align your vision to God's
[30:02] vision
[30:03] amen
[30:05] Hallelujah
[30:07] and when God Reveals His plan and his
[30:09] purpose for your life when God Reveals
[30:12] His will to you nothing can stop it
[30:14] nobody can stop the will of God nobody
[30:17] can stop the move of God nobody can stop
[30:20] God's purpose for your life
[30:22] I don't care who they are
[30:25] they can't shut the move of God down yes
[30:27] amen
[30:29] God's will will be done on Earth
[30:31] but he's looking for agents the prophet
[30:34] says it that way that God's agency has
[30:37] always been man
[30:41] amen God will not work outside of man
[30:45] God's agency is man
[30:49] amen hallelujah
[30:51] amen
[30:53] oh bless the name of Jesus
[30:56] amen so if we look here now
[31:01] amen Moses and Aaron
[31:04] they were co-workers with God
[31:07] Moses was a prophet Aaron was a priest
[31:12] amen and the people wanted water from
[31:16] The Rock
[31:17] now you may be thinking why I'm speaking
[31:19] about this
[31:21] why am I speaking about the Rock
[31:23] when we're focusing on speaking to the
[31:25] mountain
[31:28] amen
[31:29] Hallelujah
[31:34] it's because we seem to be in a similar
[31:36] time
[31:42] amen we seem to be in a similar hour
[31:45] there's dryness all around
[31:48] what does the Wilderness speak of the
[31:50] dryness
[31:51] no move of the spirit of God
[31:54] people murmuring people complaining
[31:57] amen dry no move of God
[32:02] people have shut down the move of God
[32:05] we see it daily
[32:07] people shutting down the move of God
[32:09] people shutting down the move of the
[32:11] Holy Spirit
[32:13] you tell me brother oh you you associate
[32:16] a lot to denominations no
[32:18] I associate with message people yes
[32:23] but I see them shutting down the move of
[32:25] God
[32:26] afraid of the power of God of Freedom
[32:29] what the Holy Ghost will make them do
[32:32] afraid of surrender
[32:38] amen
[32:40] dry
[32:41] no water to drink
[32:45] but God calls
[32:47] we read their numbers amen put it up
[32:49] amen
[32:51] just want to show you that one point
[32:53] amen Numbers Chapter 20.
[33:00] verse 6 Moses and Aaron went from the
[33:03] presence of the assembly unto the door
[33:06] of the Tabernacle of the congregation
[33:07] and they fell upon their faces and the
[33:10] glory of the Lord appeared unto them
[33:13] did they fall on their faces after the
[33:15] glory of God appeared
[33:17] they fell on the faces mean they were
[33:19] seeking God
[33:21] when you see God you shall see his glory
[33:25] I told you two people get grieved
[33:29] for different reasons one you grieve the
[33:31] Holy Spirit when you do not commit
[33:33] yourself to word and prayer
[33:35] secondly Satan is grieved when you do
[33:38] pray amen
[33:40] amen what got Daniel in trouble
[33:45] is prayer got him into trouble
[33:48] and whether he also reading the word
[33:52] wasn't he seeking God about when the
[33:54] Deliverance would come to them was he
[33:57] done in Babylon
[34:00] are we in another Babylon
[34:05] amen
[34:06] prayer will get you in trouble
[34:09] with the supernatural World demonic
[34:11] world
[34:12] and they start to move in men
[34:15] rose up
[34:17] remember that demonic can only walk
[34:20] through men
[34:21] same two of the spirit of God will walk
[34:23] through men
[34:25] that's why it is a great contest going
[34:27] on both fighting for the control of man
[34:31] both the genomic the Demonic world and
[34:35] the spirit of God
[34:38] that's why I say if God could take the
[34:39] veil of our eyes we'll see the kingdom
[34:41] of God is suffering violence but the
[34:44] Bible says the violence take it by force
[34:46] amen when Nehemiah those people went
[34:49] back to build the walls of Jerusalem
[34:51] they had a sword by their side
[34:54] they had to defend themselves
[34:58] amen this battle is not a picnic but you
[35:01] are here on a war dearly you're facing a
[35:04] war amen but you don't see it as a walk
[35:06] you see it as oh this person got sick
[35:09] this body demon powers oppressing people
[35:12] you don't see it as a war amen getting
[35:15] angry with the devil amen stop being so
[35:17] polite with the Devil amen the Bible
[35:20] says amen
[35:23] we take it by force
[35:25] violence take it by force
[35:28] some of us need to get violence with the
[35:30] Devil
[35:32] amen
[35:34] yes
[35:37] some of you are scared
[35:40] don't be scared
[35:41] you got a whole lot of angels
[35:44] amen backing you up
[35:46] amen didn't Angels back Daniel up
[35:50] amen his prayer connected to heaven
[35:53] amen I'm giving you Keys Amen to your
[35:56] spiritual growth amen amen I am telling
[35:59] you the reason why people can't speak to
[36:02] the mountain is because they don't speak
[36:04] to the Rock
[36:05] man
[36:10] that's why we can't fully go into it
[36:14] we first need to speak to the Rock
[36:19] amen
[36:22] that should be the name of the Lord
[36:23] let's give it a minute amen
[36:26] Hallelujah
[36:31] amen
[36:34] let's give the Lord anchor of Praise
[36:36] amen amen oh that's the name of Jesus
[36:40] amen
[36:44] so they got on their faces
[36:47] and the Shekinah glory of the Lord
[36:49] appeared unto them
[36:52] how many of you have that expectation
[36:55] amen when you get into your quiet time
[36:59] us to see the glory of the Lord amen
[37:01] don't be in a hurry to get out of the
[37:03] room yes
[37:05] if it's not the appropriate time wait
[37:08] until the appropriate time to spend time
[37:10] in prayer
[37:12] don't just do a rush job
[37:17] quieten yourself in his presence
[37:21] ask the Lord
[37:23] Lord
[37:25] move in this place
[37:28] move in this place Lord can I see your
[37:31] glory fill me with your glory Lord Jesus
[37:34] amen amen hallelujah
[37:37] and the Lord speak unto Moses take the
[37:39] rod gather the assembly together thou
[37:42] and Aaron thy brother speak unto the
[37:45] rock before their eyes
[37:48] speak to the Rock
[37:51] who did Brother Brown tell us that rock
[37:53] was
[37:54] he says that rock was Christ it was
[37:57] typing Christ
[38:01] and it shall give forth his water
[38:05] amen if you have dryness in your life if
[38:08] you have barrenness in your life speak
[38:10] to the Rock Amen
[38:14] and he shall default his Waters yes
[38:17] amen
[38:19] and thou shall bring forth to them water
[38:22] out of the rock not only will he give
[38:24] forth his Waters but you shall be able
[38:26] to give it to others
[38:29] and you'll give the congregation and the
[38:31] Beast to drink amen you know how that
[38:34] story ends
[38:36] because people couldn't handle that
[38:37] power
[38:41] you read further then
[38:45] amen I'm not going to that right now
[38:50] amen
[38:51] so before you can speak to the mountain
[38:54] you need to speak to the Rock
[38:57] The Rock recognizes the voice of faith
[39:03] amen now I want you to know this was not
[39:05] a spiritual thing
[39:07] this is not a a symbol that's written
[39:10] there there was literally a rock
[39:14] surrounded by baroness and desert
[39:17] but they spoke to the Rock
[39:22] God asked him to speak to the Rock
[39:25] God was asking them to operate in a
[39:27] certain anointing a certain power
[39:30] but they brought their man-made ideas
[39:32] he never asked him to strike The Rock
[39:35] he told him speak to the Rock Amen
[39:39] God recognizes the voice of faith
[39:42] free coming by the hearing of the word
[39:44] that's why it's important who you are
[39:47] listening to
[39:49] the voice that you are listening to is
[39:51] important amen
[39:53] amen because if you are listening to a
[39:54] voice that doesn't have faith in the
[39:56] word he's preaching
[39:58] what are you is it going to produce
[40:01] is it going to produce faith in your
[40:03] heart no it'll produce an intellectual
[40:07] concept
[40:08] but you gotta believe the one that is
[40:10] preaching the word amen The Rock
[40:12] recognizes the voice of faith when The
[40:14] Rock hears the voice of faith it gives
[40:17] what is Waters
[40:19] amen The Rock recognize the faith of
[40:22] Daniel Amen and amen Gabriel came down
[40:27] Michael came down
[40:29] amen the whole host of Heaven came down
[40:32] and there was opposing forces right
[40:35] what do you think is happening when you
[40:37] are in your prayer room amen and you are
[40:39] calling on the name of the Lord heaven
[40:41] responds to your call but there is a
[40:44] spiritual warfare so he may not always
[40:46] get your answer immediately amen but
[40:48] help is on the way amen
[40:51] amen
[40:54] amen
[40:56] The Rock recognizes one who is in their
[40:58] position and one in the authority just
[41:01] like the fix we did
[41:03] the victory recognized the Creator
[41:08] you say not so you go try to speak to
[41:11] the fig tree
[41:12] see if the Fig Tree obeys your voice
[41:18] but Jesus was teaching them
[41:21] amen that you too can operate in this
[41:25] but you don't doubt in your heart and
[41:26] you hold to that Vision you believe what
[41:29] you said
[41:33] The Rock recognizes one in their
[41:35] position one in the authority amen The
[41:38] Rock doesn't give his water to a voice
[41:40] of unbelief
[41:42] amen The Rock doesn't give forth its
[41:45] water to doubt
[41:48] Amen to irreverence
[41:51] watch our approach to The Rock
[41:54] amen the access to Freed lies in the
[41:58] prophets
[41:59] hear me now
[42:01] the children of Israel are crying to who
[42:04] to Moses and Moses had an assistant
[42:07] there with you which was Aaron
[42:10] a type of the priesthood
[42:14] God has given the church today a prophet
[42:18] and he's giving them a five-fold
[42:23] so they access to your faith lies in the
[42:26] prophet and the fivefold
[42:28] somebody say Amen or somebody believed
[42:31] that word amen Hallelujah
[42:34] they are commissioned to build a church
[42:36] amen if you don't believe that read
[42:38] Ephesians 4
[42:41] . amen people need to get a revelation
[42:43] that God won't work outside of his word
[42:47] amen God is not going to work outside of
[42:49] his program amen God is not going to
[42:52] bypass the faithful Ministry and the
[42:54] prophet and come and give you a private
[42:56] revelation
[42:59] some people have a superior Revelation
[43:01] or I stay at home
[43:04] out of the will of God
[43:07] amen but like the pro the word says
[43:10] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[43:13] it will reveal his secrets to his
[43:14] serving the prophets
[43:18] and you know the prophet that also goes
[43:20] on to say that a prophet is a modern day
[43:22] preacher
[43:24] that's what Revelation 10 11 is doing
[43:26] prophesying again how can you give
[43:29] prophecy if you're not prophetic
[43:31] amen hallelujah oh bless the name of
[43:35] Jesus amen amen hallelujah amen so God
[43:39] was confirming his word to the children
[43:41] of Israel that day no matter how Barren
[43:44] your situation no matter how dry your
[43:45] situation is if you can speak to the
[43:48] Rock Amen
[43:50] it will give what is Waters
[43:52] amen hallelujah amen brother Caleb find
[43:55] us in uh speak to this mountain

[44:15] if you love the word of the Lord amen
[44:17] you got that message so type in there
[44:20] maybe just one little green
[44:23] amen so the prophet is telling them now
[44:28] when you speak to the mountain
[44:31] remember watch what Jesus is saying if
[44:33] you don't doubt
[44:36] amen
[44:38] and you believe that what you said
[44:41] shall come to pass
[44:43] watch what he's seeing him when you
[44:45] speak to the mountain don't turn and
[44:46] walk away
[44:48] wait amen he says maybe just one little
[44:52] grain of sand begin to move through the
[44:55] whole Mountain sure yes
[44:59] amen but it's starting to move amen yes
[45:04] amen
[45:06] you might not be able to notice it but

[45:19] Hallelujah don't pray a prayer today and
[45:21] tomorrow go negotiate with the Lord okay
[45:23] if you can't do it this way can we run
[45:27] [Music]
[45:28] don't bargain like that
[45:31] when you go to God ask God for big
[45:34] things he's able to do exceedingly
[45:37] abundantly above all that you can ever
[45:39] ask or think
[45:42] amen thank you
[45:43] don't really go to God and say God maybe
[45:46] my my request was a bit unreasonable

[45:52] amen amen don't go ask something easy
[45:55] the prophet says ask God for big things
[45:58] make it impossible amen hallelujah

[46:05] what Daniel did amen when he was so
[46:07] connected with God Amen and they tried
[46:09] to shut down his prayer life

[46:14] was the ego
[46:16] he was from the tribe of them he's the
[46:18] eagle flying through Babylon
[46:21] but he was committed to his prayer life
[46:23] in the world
[46:24] and they tried to shut down his prayer
[46:26] life
[46:27] they tried to shut down his worship they
[46:29] tried to shut down his connection with
[46:31] the Unseen World
[46:33] amen but he was willing Amen to even

[46:39] about the threats or what they said they
[46:40] were going to do to him amen he knew who
[46:43] he was walking with amen he knew the
[46:46] line of the tribe of Judah amen and

[51:33] let me read it to you it says that's a
[51:35] whole lot of it today
[51:38] that's what the matter with many of our
[51:40] churches they've taken the carnal
[51:42] intellectual route and been cut off
[51:45] the supplies of God's blessing of
[51:47] healing and Power
[51:53] right and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:56] and I've taken the desert route
[52:03] what did they cut off
[52:07] the supplies of the blessings of God
[52:09] healing and power and baptism of the
[52:12] Holy Ghost and have took the desert
[52:14] route therefore we have arguing fossils
[52:16] truths and complaints

[52:58] amen
[53:00] Hallelujah you know what the accusation
[53:02] has been
[53:03] with the message Church
[53:07] because when message people generally
[53:09] talk about the supernatural
[53:12] they will refer you to the days of
[53:13] brother Branham
[53:15] they may have one of you two testimonies
[53:17] here
[53:19] but when they talk about the
[53:20] supernatural and people are not silly
[53:24] people know their level of anointing
[53:26] their brother Brandon operated in
[53:28] so they asked the question
[53:31] if you believe his message
[53:33] what happened to you that's right
[53:37] that's right amen what happened to y'all
[53:39] yeah
[53:42] powerless
[53:44] cold
[53:46] dead
[53:47] it's sometimes it's an embarrassment to
[53:49] invite people to come to the meetings
[53:55] okay

[53:59] full counsel of God Amen
[54:02] amen but I came with power and
[54:04] demonstration amen yes Lord

[54:13] say whatever you want no move of God
[54:16] people sitting there with needs yes yes
[54:18] the sick people Afflicted go read every
[54:22] one of brother Brandon's message and you
[54:23] see if he didn't call a prayer line amen
[54:25] see if he didn't pray for the sick even
[54:27] if it's not a prayer line if you're
[54:28] against prayer line it's fine
[54:30] see if he didn't pray for the sick
[54:32] see if he wasn't concerned for the
[54:34] people you know why they do it they got
[54:37] no backing of the Holy Ghost afraid to
[54:40] be exposed
[54:43] dead cold powerless
[54:49] but there's a church that's rising up
[54:50] Hallelujah not afraid of the power of
[54:53] God not afraid of the anointing of God
[54:59] where's the god of William Branham

[55:25] first Pursuit amen there was a
[55:27] predestinated scene trapped Behind the
[55:29] Walls of Jericho but nobody knew beside
[55:32] the spies that went out there
[55:37] amen and probably Joshua and Caleb was
[55:40] strategizing how they were going to
[55:42] overtake these people and the prophet
[55:44] says they may have had the best arrows
[55:46] and their Swordsmen and the bowmen and
[55:49] everybody all in position amen wondering
[55:51] how we are going to overtake the city
[55:53] because they had a great War
[55:55] you know those walls were so great that
[55:57] they had chariots races on them
[56:00] amen they prided themselves in this
[56:02] great wall for the defense
[56:06] but the prophet says amen that Joshua
[56:09] came and he met the Rock
[56:11] [Music]
[56:12] and he spoke to the Rock
[56:15] the captain of the host amen
[56:18] the prophet says many times we are not
[56:20] in speaking terms with The Rock
[56:21] that's why we can't speak to the Rock we
[56:24] can't speak to the mountain because we
[56:26] don't speak to the Rock we can't speak
[56:28] to the mountain because we have no
[56:30] prayer life we can't speak to the
[56:32] mountain because we don't know the word
[56:34] we don't read the word
[56:36] is God

[56:44] Joshua and Caleb saying we are more than
[56:46] able to take it amen he required
[56:49] Supernatural assistance
[56:51] and God didn't ask the permission
[56:54] God didn't inform them I'm coming to
[56:56] help you

[57:18] hosts God is the Lord of hosts talking
[57:21] about the Angelic world Amen he's the
[57:23] Lord of hosts
[57:25] but yet he comes down as the captain of
