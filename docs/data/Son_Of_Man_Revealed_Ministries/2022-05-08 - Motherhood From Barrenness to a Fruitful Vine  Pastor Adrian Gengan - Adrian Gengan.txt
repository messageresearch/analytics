amen amen greet every one of you in the lovely name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen it's good to see every one of you again amen it somehow feels like it's been ages since we've seen you amen and uh certainly miss you amen and we pray that the lord is keeping you by his grace keeping you in good health amen so we want to wish all our beautiful mothers a happy happy mother's day amen let's give our mothers a hand amen for the fantastic job they're doing in amen preserving motherhood amen holding to godly principles the way god intended motherhood to be amen so this morning amen so we'd like to greet you and uh also the mothers that are not sure i know a lot of people are sick if my wife is not sure this morning the children are sick amen so we pray that the lord will bless them during this mother's day amen and we ought to be grateful for our mothers amen amen we ought to appreciate our mothers while they are alive amen so certainly want to appreciate every one of you want to appreciate my mom amen wish you a happy mother's day amen and not forgetting all the moms that have gone on before amen we always remember them amen so this morning we'll speak a little thoughts motherhood from barrenness to a fruitful vine amen from barrenness to a fruitful vine we'll turn to john chapter 16 and verse 21 and our lord jesus is talking and he's talking about a woman in travail and it's in john 16 and 21 it says a woman when she is in travail at sorrow because the hour is calm but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembered no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world amen amen so she remembers no more the anguish because a man is born into the world psalms 128 and 3 amen psalms 128 and 3 reads this thy wife shall be a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house and thy children like olive plants round about thy table thy wife shall be a fruitful vine by the sides of that house thy children like olive plants round about thy table one chapter before that psalms 127 and verse 3 says lord children are an heritage of the lord and the fruit of the whom is his reward amen children are an heritage of the lord and the fruit of the whom is his reward amen and the lord that blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so just casting our thoughts on motherhood and we know the bible tells us in revelation chapter 13 8 that the lamb of god was slain from before the foundation of the world amen the lamb of god was slain from before the foundation of the world so god by his full knowledge knew that man would fall yes and he already prepared a way for man way back in the beginning for the lamb to be slain and it had to be born on the earth jesus was not going to arrive from heaven a fully grown man like how when god appeared to abraham in genesis 18. he was going to be born into the human race amen so knowing that he had the lamb in the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world and the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world we know that this shows us god's thought about motherhood because if the land had to be born they must be a mother so god thoughts of motherhood from the foundation of the world so through childbearing through motherhood the lamb would be born to save man from their sin so god wanted to display his love to mankind and the first expression of his love is through a mother amen when a child is born before they are aware of anything around them they are welcomed into the world by mother's love amen and they will continue to be surrounded by mother's love all the days of their lives amen amen we find that no matter what a child does he'll always or she'll always be surrounded by mother's love amen a mother's love is the closest expression of god's unconditional love amen a mother's love is an attribute of god because it is unconditional amen we find no matter what a child may do no matter how bad how wrong it may be a mother will always love a child and want to protect her child amen now we're talking about godly mothers we know we are living in satan's eden where god where satan the god of this evil age has corrupted the morals of women so you get cruel women cruel women who rip babies from the whom they call it abortion amen but we are focusing on godly mothers amen the way god intended it to be amen so no matter how old or how wrong and wayward he may be [Music] he could be a grown man but mother's love reaches out to him people may be against him the law may be against him society may be against him but a mother will always want to protect her child why is that it's in a god given nature to love it's in our nature to care to protect to serve the family we know that mother is the fifth gospel amen and she gets them before the teaching of matthew mark luke and john amen mother is the first gospel and mother gets them before the teachings of matthew mark luke and john amen i'm happy to see brother's passion and his family i was worried about them i figured he went to pick up sister sodhi so amen good to see you all this morning god bless you amen so mother gets them before matthew mark luke john so a child will first learn about love the love of god from your mother amen a child will hear the first songs about jesus from mom jesus loves me this i know for the bible tells me so and she'll sing lullabies jesus loves the little children all the children of the world amen amen and the b-i-b-l-e amen that is the book for me amen i know some of you are getting broody now they have children just hold on it's a bit tough racing for children a man but look at the influence of mother before the child is aware of anything you are instilling godly values into that child amen you have the first access to that brain of the child to the heart of the child to the soul of the child amen amen a child will learn its first bible verse from its mother like john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so you find before the sunday school teacher gets the child mom has the child before the school teacher gets the child mom has the child amen amen hallelujah but that is god's pattern why amen it tells you to train it it's giving mom the opportunity to train up the child in the way it should go because when it grows up it will not depart from the faith amen so what does it tell you the four gospels can only point you to jesus to the love of jesus amen but the fifth gospel expresses the love of jesus to you amen the four gospels is just a written word it has no emotion to it for you to experience the four gospels in its entirety you must be baptized with the holy ghost then it will come alive amen but before you even counter that baptism of the holy ghost you have one expression mother's love amen the love of jesus expressed through that fifth gospel so we we want to love and appreciate all godly mothers this morning and remember the labels of love they live they sacrifice to the children to the family we also want to remember the moms who have gone to rest whom we miss and we love dearly mothers in the church in another dimension not even a few feet from where i am right now amen hallelujah you know brother branches we are bumping into our theophanies so if your theophany is in that sixth dimension and you're bumping into your theophany then they are right here a cloud of witnesses amen hallelujah son of man revealed ministries has another branch in the sixth dimension they have a pastor amen and a few congregants here amen and there's the son of man revealed ministries here amen both alive one more life than we are one more young than we are amen hallelujah what a glorious hope that is amen hallelujah we are so feeble and feeling miserable this morning but they in the spring of their life amen amen amen hallelujah so amen we cannot wait to be united with them they left us with their beautiful memories and instilled in us values that we will carry with us and instill in our own children and others amen so we look at the first woman in the bible the first mother and we know eve was the mother now we're just talking about the male sounds cain able and sith we know that in genesis 3 16 the lord told eve i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring for children and that desire shall be to thy husband he shall rule over thee then in chapter four verse one and adam knew his wife and she conceived and became and said i have gotten a man from the lord and she again bare his brother abel then in 425 it says adam knew his wife again now notice there was only two knowings there right right he doesn't say adam knew his wife she became adam knew his wife she bear able if you read that old chapter you'll see they're talking about the lineage and every time a man and wife come together and they conceive it talks about new his wife and here adam only knew his wife twice showing you the hidden mystery there and that is why eve does not say i have gotten a son from the lord amen she said that god made man from the lord it was not her son well yeah it was a son in a way but you know what i mean amen it came from the serpent amen the serpent seed amen so he knew his wife again and she bare his son and called his name sith for god said had for god for she said god had appointed me another seed instead of abel whom king slew now thought this morning is from a barren woman to a fruitful vine because brother brennan tells us that adam was given a wife to reproduce himself amen adam was given a wife to reproduce himself so if a woman is barren and unfruitful how are they going to bring about the plan of god because god told them be fruitful and multiplied now we find a few women who are barren in the bible now after god had done dealing with adam and eve you don't find him talking about them again right when he drove them from the garden you'll get the genealogy of how they bear the children and you don't hear about them again when he's dealing with another man that man has already has big children noah but when he starts his family in a new world with abraham he chooses a man and that his wife is barren so how is she going to fulfill genesis amen be fruitful and multiply in a better condition amen so we find in genesis 25 in genesis 21 the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken so we are reading the end of it when a baroness turned to be a fruitful vine but i want you to know it was the genesis 18 account a word descending from another dimension amen coming into this dimension amen when abraham saw three coming towards him amen the mighty angel had descended and he was coming there amen and he gave them a promise according to the time of life he was bringing back title deed to them he was bringing back inheritance to them amen so we find if the evil soul with the pride that's why revelation 10 is so important to us because prior to that seven church ages was a barren unfruitful wife but we receive communication and nourishment from another world from another dimension in revelation 10 when that mighty angel descends is bringing back the title deed of man's inheritance amen we find here that's genesis 21 and 2 it says for sarah conceived and bear abraham his son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him now don't get confused with that scripture you'll say but you message people are preaching that god turned abraham and sarah back to a young man and woman again amen he was a 75 year old young looking man backwards like some backyard mechanic on the clock [Music] garden re-agent he just made him young again amen that's why the bible is saying that sarah bear abraham hassan in his old age so according to the timeline yes he was that age but he was in a young body again amen and at the set time of which god had spoken to him and abraham called the name of the son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac i want you to know that abraham's seed will never be barren right abraham's seed will never be unfruitful amen hello blessing our blessing amen oh this morning i hope we know that we are abraham's sheep through the royal sheep amen and the blessings that apply to abraham apply to you and i am amen in blessing i will bless you amen abraham's seed will never be unfruitful or barren right amen we find it wasn't only the case with sarah here's the case with rebecca daughter-in-law the chosen one the one who eliza sent across the desert to go and find she can't have children she's barren and in in genesis 25 and 21 isaac and treated the lord for his wife because she was barren amen and the lord was entreated of him and rebecca his wife conceived amen we are speaking about from barrenness to a fruitful vine so rebecca bore two children jacob and esau amen then we come in now another generation goes and lord is working through jacob jacob takes a wife amen we know he has given the wrong wife then he has two wives leah couldn't have children initially rachel couldn't have children and the bible reads in genesis 29 31 and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened up oh glory hallelujah that shows you that god is in charge of opening and closing people's homes you are not here by chance if you are here today amen sitting here and hearing my voice god had amen so that you can be an expression of himself here on the earth today amen he opened up a home but rachel was barren amen and here conceived and bears son so leah has four sons consecutively she has ruben she has simeon she has levi and she has judah four children amen then we know the servants the seven girls get involved and rachel gives a servant girl amen and i want you to know this is typing the four anointings because jacob is surrounded by four women amen four women bear him children four women bear him the twelve sons so he is god's four anointings the lion the ox the man and the eagle amen amen think of the heavenly kingdom how it's set up amen amen with the twelve foundations the four gates yes they typed in jacob's life amen and we find that amen after rachel prays to the lord and in genesis 30 it says god remembered rachel amen god has not forgotten you you may have been praying about his situation keep holding on keep believing amen god has not forgotten you it says and god remembered rachel and hearkened to her and opened up her home and she conceived and bear sand and said god had taken away my reproach and she called his name joseph and said what's your prophesy now the lord shall add to me another amen hallelujah don't be satisfied with just one blessing amen amen she had just received one son and she says the lord will add to me another she prophesied by faith amen hallelujah you remember the time when when the king when the prophet told the king how many arrows take it and throw it you remember that time he could have taken 100 arrows and thrown it but he only took a certain amount and the prophet rebuked him for that and he says because you have only taken three arrows only three times you will smite them so i'm saying when god is blessing you speak life to it amen don't be satisfied that you had wine in the wedding eggman and when the wine is finished you say oh i am satisfied i have drunk all the wine ask god for more even if there's no wine you will turn water into wine amen don't be satisfied with your current situation don't be satisfied with your current circumstance amen amen amen hallelujah amen we find here that rachel's home was open and she bought joseph we know later on she bought benjamin so god is turning this woman's barrenness to be a fruitful vine amen we see joseph and moses amen how she valued a child this was a mother the threat of pharaoh the threat upon the life of a son to kill them but she she knew how to protect the world she knew that he was a proper son she went about to protect the world and if you know that this word is the proper word then you'll take this word and hide it in your heart amen hallelujah you know that this word is not a denominational creed and a dogma amen you'll know that revelation 10 7 is fulfilled you'll know that malachi 4 5 and 6 is fulfilled luke 17 30 is also fulfilled amen how do you know luke 17 30 is fulfilled what does it say as it was in the days of lot amen so shall it be amen in the coming of the son of man how do we know it we saw the sign of the son of man but we also know another sign which is clearly evident amongst us amen how do we know it it says as it was in the days of who lot amen because abraham when he saw three comings he said my lord how you know it's the days of lord amen amen we get all trueness and all these people coming up amen here's another barrel woman anna in the temple i'm trying to show you abraham's children are not content to bring baron that's right amen amen in first samuel 120 when it come to pass when the time was come about after anna conceived that she bears son and called his name samuel saying because i have asked him of the lord amen then we find a man the most glorious of all women the most blessed of all women with no disrespect to our sisters here this morning but the bible called and said that our favorite amongst all women amen amen we're not going to elevate you to the place of the catholic church this morning but the bible did say mary was highly favored of the lord amen amen in the sixth month you know that gabriel hill came to that city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin that was a spouse to a man named joseph amen amen and she the virgin's name was mary and the angel came into and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed are thou among women amen and when she saw him she was troubled that he's saying she knew that this was an unusual greeting amen and cast a mind what man of celebration this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou was found favor with god oh hallelujah it's something special when you find favor with god amen noah found grace in the eyes of the lord i want to let you know that the bride in this last days the wife of the lord jesus christ has found favor with the lord amen when vasti had rejected the king esther is the accepted one amen and he found and she found favor in the king's eyes amen and the angels and said behold i shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and his name shall be called jesus didn't that bring relief to you jesus name above every other name name at which demons tremble you feeling troubled whisper jesus you're feeling down and out jesus amen hallelujah you're feeling grieved in your spirit jesus just to mention of your name amen amen oh listen to this now he shall be great he's the great one he shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom shall be no end we know all the kingdoms of this world are going to come falling down but the kingdom of our lord jesus christ there shall be no end amen and you have been granted the privilege to be the queen amen then we know amen that how the angel told her the holy ghost shall come upon you and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also all the holy thing which is born of thee shall be called the son of god notice shall be called son of god amen amen so we look at that amen and i can you imagine amen can you imagine mary's excitement because she knew of a zios prophecy amen she knew about the zionist prophecy and isaiah 9 6 says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful his name is wonderful his name is wonderful his name is wonderful jesus my lord amen amen you shall be called counselor amen he shall be called counselor you need counselling he is the counselor amen you're going through a difficult time you need somebody to speak to he's the counselor amen the mighty god the mighty god not a mighty god the mighty god everlasting father now we've got two fathers lot got two fathers the everlasting the prince of peace amen hallelujah let's turn to isaiah 51 in verse 1. oh don't you love jesus this morning he's the wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father he's the prince of peace he's the rose of sharon he's the great i am amen this morning i don't care what cycle you are in god is going to end your barrenness god is going to end the barrenness of poverty god's going to end the barrenness of sickness of disease amen of lack of want amen being fruitful vine amen isaiah 51 54 and verse 1 says sing o baron saying oh baron even before you receive it sing amen even in your barren condition saying amen even though you don't have what you're trusting the lord for sing amen [Music] amen break forth into sin and cry loud thou thou thou did not travail with child for more the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith the lord amen amen you can go on reading that but god is promising amen you that your home is going to be open amen but you gotta act like you received it even before you even show symptoms of it while you are still in your barren condition while you are still trusting the lord for his situation you gotta praise him praise him praise him in the morning i'll praise him in the noon time amen sing o barren blessed with singing amen hallelujah oh bless the name of jesus listen to galatians 4 and verse 19 what the apostle paul is saying here now amen my little children of whom i travail in birth again he's talking about birth pains he's saying i'm laboring in the gospel for something that you can bring forth the life of christ my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you [Music] amen first timothy 2 and 14 first timothy 2 and 14 the apostle paul you're dealing with the first mother he says adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression not withstanding she shall be saved in child bearing i mean if you are getting the concept of that scripture he's talking about eve being deceived but in order for eve to be saved she need to continue with childbearing because the promise was given to her amen that the seed of the women will prove the serpent's head amen so you read the scripture with understanding the woman being deceived was in transgression not withstanding she shall be saved in childbearing amen because one of the seed was going to be the lord jesus christ even though they didn't know who it was when joseph came they thought he was the one when moses came they thought he was the one but god could have no confidence in none of these men amen but there was one pawn of eversion amen the spotless sinless land so in order for them to continue to be saved for mankind to be saved then god had to open sarah's home god had to open rebecca's room god had to open leah's room god had to open rachel's room god had to open hannah's home amen he was turning baroness into a fruitful vine because from the seed of the woman was going to come forth the deliverer so woman was going to be saying through child bearing because the lamb that was from before the foundation of the world was going to be injected into the human race amen second peter 1 and 8 now dealing with the church amen dealing with the church now talking about you know what second peter one is about talking about those seven virtues from faith to charity it says if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen there's only one woman like this who have come through all seven church ages all seven steps amen that now has the knowledge the revelation of jesus christ you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful amen romans 8 verse 19 let me hear the bibles page through your bibles romans 8 19 amen for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god oh hallelujah the earnest expectation the earth is in travail creation is in travail waiting for the sons of god to be born [Music] amen read again for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god in verse 22 for we know that the all creation groaneth and prevail it in pain together until now what pain is that birth pains amen and not only they but we ourselves also have birth pains which are the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our bodies [Music] why are we going here amen we're gonna close with this thought jesus does not want a barren and unfruitful wife amen we've had seven church ages of it and when the husband came home at evening time he was knocking at the door to gain entrance into his house but the woman would not let him in amen now bringing it to light this quote that the bride has the mind of christ and she knows what he once done with the word jesus told us the word is a seed a man gives seed so the bride has the mind of christ she knows what he once done with his seed so she must take in his seed by taking in the word you are taking in his seed by eating the book amen remember what we spoke the last time eating signifies it signified a relationship between a man and a woman amen right remember that scripture that says and the doubts this woman eateth wipe in the mouth and says i have done no wrong amen so here we are in the end time jesus knocking at the door he wouldn't let him in he was coming home through seven church ages he says lest i come lest i come and here he was right there now he had come and he was knocking yet they wouldn't open up to jesus amen and we know amen how he had sent the prophet to find him a bride a type of eliezer finding a bride for the lord jesus christ and how he had to take her through those seven steps of faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness all the way to charity amen and bring her to this place that she is now the built-up church the pyramid city amen waiting for the camp strong amen the capstone of love crying grace grace amen what do we find amen that jesus now how is all creation groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god you can only have sons of god if jesus and his wife have children hello what does that mean will you have little children no you must reproduce the life of christ you must reproduce the life of christ that is you bringing forth children for christ amen right we looked at extensively and all the women in the bible those that were barren how god had turned their barrenness to a fruitful vine we looked at genesis now we come to revelation and we see two women here amen both mothers in revelation 12 you'll find a great one day in heaven a woman clothed with the sun moon under her feet head crowned 12 stars and she being a child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and they appeared another one day in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads ten horns seven crowns and upon his head and his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour a child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child which was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and a child was caught up to god unto god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared of god that they should feed her a thousand two hundred and three squad days amen so here's a woman amen giving birth in revelation 12 but we find another woman in revelation 17 revelation 17 says he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast and the woman was arrayed in purple and a scarlet color and decked with gold precious stones of pearls having a golden cup in a handful of abominations and filthiness of fornication so this woman was having children out of wedlock right why she's a cage of every hateful bird she's a cage of every unclean and hateful bird and upon her head was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots she's a mother the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth how many of you know satan only copies what god does because god is now establishing his kingdom god has selected a wife for himself and this wife is reproducing his life right so jesus and his family but here we find in satan's even he's also got a woman a and she has daughters harlow daughters abomination of the earth amen amen you look at the big fine fancy buildings in fact if you go to these buildings you can't help but stand and wonder you are whole it's like beautiful [Music] but [Music] think of it the bible says abomination of the earth amen i'll close with this quote [Music] jesus in the rapture message jesus wants fruit for himself his wife must bring forth the kind of children that he is then if you don't bring forth children bright children were children then it's the denominational child then her first love for the world and denomination she's gone back to that but it and it can't bring forth a real genuine born-again christian because there's nothing there to bring it forth so what is jesus looking for you to bring for children to bring forth bright children were children to be a real born-again christian amen amen so this morning even as we dwelt on motherhood if we have not been we don't have the life of christ within us we don't have the fruits of the spirit amen we find that that word born again christian seems foreign to us right amen if somebody asks you are you a born-again christian you're almost it's almost like a natural response of how the prophet asked somebody are you a christian amen and they say i allow you to believe i'm catholic you know we shouldn't be that way in the message oh i i'm in the message no are you a born again christian amen amen say yes brother sister and i'm filled with the holy ghost amen hallelujah how about you they ask you are you born again christian said how about you amen and then say how were you baptized amen amen they'll tell you we were baptized according to j.f rowlands baptism in the name of the father son and holy ghost he says oh you were baptized according to that baptism have you not heard of acts 2 and verse 38. amen a jew backslidden people need to repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the holy ghost amen you see why they are wandering around without the holy ghost the baptism is wrong amen hallelujah but there's a bride was not ashamed to be identified with his name amen amen will proudly display the banner of the lord jesus christ proudly got the blood on display amen amen oh bless the name of jesus so god wants to turn your barrenness this morning into a fruitful vine amen maybe maybe it's a more simple thing maybe in your service to the lord you are barren and you're just serving the lord maybe take a simple thing like coming to church you are barren [Music] you are dry god can take that barrenness and turn it into a fruitful vine amen maybe your zeal for the lord is god and you are barren god can turn it around amen maybe you're serving the lord now on your own terms and your own conditions maybe you're serving the lord when it is convenient for you don't serve the lord that way even if it's inconvenient serve the lord amen even if it's inconvenient serve the lord put an effort into the things of god say but all it's just a small gathering they won't even miss me we miss you even more when it's a small gathering amen no that's just a wednesday service just a sunday service i'll go next week baroness no zeal no desire there's a barrenness there amen amen no love for the people of god parent but jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another [Music] in that maybe we are barren the only thing the only time we talk about somebody else you should talk bring them down and tear them down right to talk stories about somebody how about a good report how about a good testimony amen love covers a multitude of sin you hate without the cause amen you love nobody and you hate without the cause barren unfruitful some of you waiting for this maybe your finances are barren hey it's like old mother hubble who looked in the cupboard hey but you want god to only turn that one that barrelness to fruitfulness and he will do it because it's part of the blessings but we only want to be selective but let him turn our barrenness say lord i want the life of christ in me i want to reproduce your life amen i want to love i want to love my brothers love my sisters amen i want to reconcile maybe your your brother your relationship is broken reconcile amen don't go to the grave having unreconciled things be the better person amen be the humble person say brother sister i'm sorry please forgive me when i cross jordan i don't want to have no troubles there let me make these things right now you know what you'll be the better person nobody will look down on you right the lord will even show favor upon you amen amen because god is looking for a humble heart but we want to be proud and arrogant how short and who i am till death do us part i will inflict vengeance upon them that's not a fruitful vine let us forgive let us love now this is going from the pulpit to the pew amen it's for all of us let us love the world is deprived of love we opened up telling about mother's love the world is deprived of love and you know people can sense when you love them people can sense when you care for them amen so let us be the fruitful vine of our lord jesus christ and bring forth his life that they will really see you and say you know what you remind me of jesus because only jesus loves like this then now you become an expression of his attribute of love
