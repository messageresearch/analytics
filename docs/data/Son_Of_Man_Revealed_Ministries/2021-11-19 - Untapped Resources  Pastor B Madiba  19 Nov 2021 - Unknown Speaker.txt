there amen you can reach out by faith you can reach out like that centurion said lord don't even come home but just speak the word lord and my servant will be healed amen maybe your loved one is not even in the service but speak the word amen the lord will reach out to them and touch them save the amen those that need salvation heal those that are sick but it determines and how we come to the service we get what we expect amen so if we come with the right expectation amen with the right motivation to say lord we come to give you praise we come to give you glory we come to prove that you are hebrews 13 8. you are not a god of only 1951 you are not a god who worked with moses and the red sea and the god worked with joshua but that same god that worked with those children of israel he's still the same god working in a many mini-membered body amen let's give the lord a good anclab of praise amen oh he is truly worthy to be praised amen god bless you you may be seated amen hallelujah amen the atmosphere is charged you just want to preach preparing the way for the pastor amen so we want to welcome every one of you in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ the king of kings and the lord of lords amen the one whose name is the lord jesus christ and we have been given an inheritance to be a part of that name we are the married wife of the lord jesus christ we are mrs jesus christ amen so certainly glad to be found in the house of the lord this evening amen we'd like to welcome every one of you in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen we have pastor shane with us here amen let's give him a hand and he's amen some of the believers from his church his lovely wife amen we got pastor denzel amen i just want him to raise his hand so pastor

good to see him amen any other visitors amongst us let's give our amen unseen guest a hand amen our lord jesus christ amen he deserves all the praise glory and honor amen so we want to welcome you to the services and we want you to be free in the services amen we want you to pull on the word of god amen because your miracle can take place here tonight amen your supernatural experience can take place here tonight everybody has an appointed time this could be our appointed time this evening amen so amen we were talking about the inspiration of the meetings as brother jeff was telling you and no fruit appears on top of the tree everything starts in seed form amen so we come 70 years since the prophet of the age touched durban soil amen and that seed was planted back then we know men like sydney jackson amen men like julia statcliff was instructed to write a prophet visit south africa documented and wrote about the miraculous things that were happening amen so we don't want to forget before we go any further we want to welcome uh we got josephine and we got autumn as well who wants to read you some maybe just a portion of the events that transpired just to kick start the meeting because you know some of us may not know what happened remind you and uh they themselves didn't know what happened till i gave them the thing to read amen so we got a whole new generation that's risen up and we need to tell them amen what the great things the lord has done the most outstanding meetings were held in the meetings were held in the city hall others were held at the gravel race class at the opening service on wednesday evening a mother brought her 11 year old son in a wheelchair she left her boy in a wheelchair up in front where the rest of the sick people were seated herself [Music] she found out the boy had stood up without any help she told him to get out of the wheelchair and try to walk he did and was able to walk for the first time in several years friday night brandon went to town to buy a pair of slippers going into the shoe shop the clog just walking out of the store who had been bought his first pair of shoes in 20 years his feet had been so deformed that he was this man received his healing and now his feet were normal amen hallelujah thank you amen so they coordinated that themselves there as you can see amen but out of the mouth of babes amen the truth is told amen what the lord has done amen so we were talking about that and we were so inspired by what happened and when we see a bride in full maturity now amen a bride who recognizes a position recognizes authority amen reproducing the very life of christ amen and that's what christ wants christ wants fruit for himself amen he wants seed for himself he wants his own life to be reproduced in us amen so we thought we'll use this as an excuse to celebrate and thank the lord and give him praise for what he's done for us amen we are not ungrateful people we come to the lord and we say thank you lord for what you have done for us because let's be honest i did not been for this message where would we have been amen trapped in some denomination trapped worshipping idols trapped in some catholic system but the son of man had come to set us free amen hallelujah those spiritual genes that he had in the back part of his mind amen hallelujah they came to maturity in this age so we're thankful for the portion of the bride that he's raised up here in durban south africa and we stand as a testimony and a witness of the ministry of william branham though see that he laid he may not even have been able to maybe never saw a vision of what the full mature church would be but he said the seeds will go out in book form amen in magazines in papers amen it will go out and look what the lord has done so this evening amen we don't waste too much of time we have with us our pastor boytomelo madiba amen let's give him a hand madiba is married with one wife amen he's got three children uh the names are tomisho tobejo and bonello amen so he's married with three children and he started and he's been a pastor since 2008 at a church based in wood bank called the lighthouse tabernacle so he's 42 years old and he's a bit younger than me so i just want to tell him i'm his elder amen so we want to welcome him to durban and we give him liberty to preach the word of the lord amen we have not discussed what's to be preached but we said lord as the holy spirit gives utterance give us our portion this evening amen so let's stand together and welcome the holy spirit amen to minister and speak the word amen hallelujah bless the name of jesus oh what a wonderful savior we have amen hallelujah you believe the angel of god is right here amen you got it brother caleb amen bless the name of jesus [Music] until this day no man could tell us just where [Music] but through the eyes of the prophet god revealed to us before god was god all the way the future home new things are being declared [Music] [Music] oh in this new day [Music] amen i greet all of you in the name of our lord jesus christ are you happy to be here tonight how many are happy to be message believers it is such a grand privilege i want to greet the ministers who are here together with their wives and i want to greet you sister gengan as well senior and brother adrian and his wife and the elders and the whole church amen it is a privilege to be invited here to come and speak to you uh i always say uh when you i think the sisters would diet is dictated by the body that is within them so similarly spiritually speaking i cannot feed you theology i cannot feel you motivational i can only fit the bright the unalterated word of the living god i mean appreciated the fullness of the weight today so we appreciate the motive and objective of this meeting and just pray i don't bring anything new we just echo what brother branham has already spoken brother branham says if god's lost because she was looking for the new thing but here we are with something tested the word of god how many believe the weight will defeat satan anyway anytime and under any condition the same god that was here in 1951 is still here today in 2021 amen so god bless you richly i enjoyed the view music my brother i was having a jubilee in the office as you were leading the songs amen shall we bow our heads for prayer gracious heavenly father we approach your throne of mercy acknowledging our insufficiency and acknowledging that you are the almighty god your people are here this evening and they came with expectations because they are got they know that you have never disappointed them even one time dear god there is no disease that is incurable in your presence there is no problem that cannot be resolved in your presence and there is no situation that cannot be subdued in your presence your prophet many a times when he prayed he would say i take every spirit under my control and this evening as the bride of jesus christ we take every spirit under our control for your glory may the holy spirit move in an unhindered way may the sick be healed may there be deliverance is the dear god we are not worshipping a historical god but we are worshiping the ever-present and god you're always with us a dear god and i believe many believers tonight if they were to be given an opportunity they would tell a lot of things that you have done for them brother branham says god never leaves himself without a witness there are many witnesses in the building dear god that can testify about your greatness we sang a song i'm only in this message by grace how many people were with it to be in the message learning the people but it passed them and came to the predestinated seat that's why our hearts are full of gratitude where would we be had it not being of this message how would our families being without this message how would our children have been without this message what kind of ministries would we have without this message this message has elevated us above dear god satan's nonsense and brought us closer to you heavenly father we are not ashamed of this message and i believe ministers that are here tonight when they come to the end of their journey they want to speak like paul of the old i was not a disobedient to the heavenly vision that is the dear god the desire of every brother and every sister we pray for the host the pastor and with his dear wife a dear god and we pray for the whole laity the elder said dear god may you blessed the logistics may the meetings come out the way it was expected a year ago may there be testimony supposed to this meeting dear god maybe there's something moving even among our young people dear god so that they can testify that there is a god who is living dear god we committed the reading of the way to you as a reporter for duty i'm not here to show my skills i'm just yet your god as a mere mortal may you dear god take this body and use it as a vessel that when we come to the end of the service may they all the glory go to you dear god as we commit everything to you in the name of jesus christ and the whole church shall say amen amen as we turn to the book of luke 18 i don't know the brother that was there if you can help me i just did the microphone i think people that came before me were taller amen god bless you i i prefer let it be here and then we will sort it out amen become closer yeah god bless you my brother as we turn to the book of luke 18 verse 27 i would invite you to read with me if you don't mind or read immediately after me and he said are you all here church let's reach it together and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god how many witnesses are in the body in the book of psalms 78 from verse 41 it rates in this manner if it has been found just to give you a minute or two to find it psalm 78 from verse 41 to verse 43. is it found can we read amen it says yeah they turned it back and tempted god you can read with me and limited the holy one of israel i hope you check it he was not limited he is not at the limited god but they limited him god is unlimited he is limited by people's faith they remember to note his hand i hope as devin won't forget his hand know the day when he delivered to them from the enemy how he had wrought his signs in egypt and his oneness in the field of zohan god bless you richly as you take your seats so this evening i just went amen there a bigger god and he says you can never exhaust god's blessings hallelujah and he says what he has done yesterday he will do today and i think debbie is known for quite a number of things historically the zulus would remember kinshaka and some would visit devin and remember the bani chao there's quite a lot of things that you can remember about devin but the greatest thing that has ever happened in dubin were the meetings that were held by brother brennan that it leaps all the meetings in the history of the church amen so it is quite wonderful for what god has done amen now let me brother just bring this quotation so that we built our foundation in the message if you don't mind i've got some quotations to read hallelujah sometimes the things have got you to go through the weighty filter we live during a time where people speak their minds but sometimes it's best that the god should speak amen and i hope that yes you are there you've got to the way to test amen now brother abraham says in the message of faith once he delivered it to the saints paragraph 24 he says when god called christ from the grave and he ascended up jesus left he waited to his church to go into all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that he believed science was to follow the church how far unto all the world some people want to limit that limit that faith into a creed someone to limit it to a denomination but i say this upon the authority of god's weight there is no limit to the faith of god that he left for his church because he said all things are possible to them that believe and he says it's not limited do you believe that all things are possible to them that believe folks these signs are supposed to follow the church what god did in 1951 it cannot remain in history hallelujah there's got to be a repeat of that because we've got a new generation that was not there but they've got to see the god of today so that mommy and dad can say this this god what he is doing today is exactly what he did in 1951 hallelujah but brother probably said many times people want to limit god and i believe that even on the basis of teachings it depends on how people have been taught some the danger today we can become intellectual about the message but i don't want to become intellectual about the message because when you become just intellectual they see come to church and they go back sick people come depressed they go home depressed hallelujah you cannot come sick and go back sick you cannot come with resources and we still have resources that we can tap you into as a church of the living god hallelujah you must make sure that god is resident in your house you must make sure that god is there with you at your work so that you are able to pinpoint certain things in your life and say this is what god has done and this is what god has done it gives you a credibility as a believer can i have an amen now let us come to this second quotation my brother what does what does thou hear paragraph 70 the prophet of god says no matter how much we cry out and think this that or the other nothing can take us until god is finished with us folks the devil will never take you sickness will never take you nothing will take you until god is finished with you you can be short at a close range you'll still survive a gun shot because if god's purpose is not yet fulfilled there is nothing that will take you folks our being here was determined by god and our departure here will be determined by god you don't live here because you are careless you live because it's your time are you still with me here the and at no point in time as we approaching power to satay satan is powerless i say satan is powerless satan has got no power over us satan has got no power over the life of a believer brother brennaman said god's purpose in your life shall never be defeated folks god's purpose in your life shall never be defeated if god designed that you will take a certain path the devil will never stop you hallelujah demons will never stop you can i get an amen on that one and brother branham say i'm glad i'm so glad that you know that and the reason i'm reading this quotation that is somewhere where i'm going because there are people that are expecting brother brahm to rise from the dead and continue with the ministry i beg to differ hallelujah god took brother brennan because brother branham's ministry was done hallelujah we are not waiting brother brennaman to come back as a preacher we are waiting for him to come back with the saints hallelujah but the culture that was with william branham is still on the scene hallelujah willem branham is not on the scene but the god of william branham is still on the scene are you still with me here the devil must never tell you that what happened only happened in 1963 it can still be repeated in 2021 if you have quoted the same level of faith hallelujah now brother branham is preaching here in the message the church of the living god paragraph 84. he says master is in prayer it seems that my life is dwindling away from me i don't know how much longer you have let me be here on this earth but i pray for many years if you can use me but when thou art finished with me may i come to you but i know that i shall be able to stay until i've completed the work that you have for ordained that i sh that should be done so brother branham was kept here until the work that he was four or ten to do was completed so brother branham did not leave an incomplete work hallelujah the message is complete folks the message cannot be corrected the message was delivered and it's perfect hallelujah and i can take it further there are no mistakes in the message this this message is mistakes approved you can feed on this message with assurance that there is no mistake at all folks i'm not even ashamed to say there are no mistakes in the message of the hour this message is perfect hallelujah and this message will defeat satan this message defeated satan in the 50s and this message will defeat satan in 2021 there is even more voltage in the message today than it was in 2021 why when the enemy comes like a flood god will raise the standard as the people get deeper and deeper into sin god is increasing the voltage in the message of the hour this message will deliver our children this message will preserve our marriages this message will preserve our churches there is power in this message there is deliverance in this message there is still healing power in this message that's why i say this message shall never be defeated hallelujah now on a message on the wings of a snow white dove paragraph 225 he says why me an old man suffered all my life why why did he heal me now he said very profound statement i believe i'll ride this trail again i got to bring a message now people took the phrase i will ride this trail one more time that's why they're expecting brother branham to come on to the scene and i say i beg to differ and i want to demonstrate tonight what this phrase means i shall ride this trail one more time hallelujah in the message and know with it not in that message brother branham a brother speaks to your brother brandon about the dream that he had and in this dream he said brother branham i saw you you were on a white horse and it says that horse looked like a military horse it isn't a message and no with it not you can reference it from paragraph 257 to paragraph 265 and it says you were on a white house and it looked like a military horse and say you were moving towards the east and you screamed at the top of your voice i shall ride this trail one more time and it says the whole earth is shook and it says as you were riding towards the east you came across a group of scientists it says they look like they were busy mixing some stuff in the tube and he says you shall i shall write this one more time he said they looked at you and they struck their shoulders and you moved on hallelujah and i say as you moved on then the person on a horse that looked like a mixture of white and black it's an impersonation folks when we speak about a horse we speak about power now brother brahma say well this gentleman says to your brother when you were on that horse this person was on this white hole and he says this person he wanted to trip the horse that you were on but it says this horse that you are on it kept in the line and it kept on marching forward you know what it means folks there is no power that will derail the message i say there is no power that will derail the message the message will go forward no demon will stop this message no devil will stop this message and as a matter of fact no impersonation will stop this message this message will deliver the results this message will rapture you hallelujah and then in that he said you screamed again i shall write this trail one more time hallelujah i want to follow up on that maybe brother can skip the second second one i need to get to the africa vision uh statement brother branham had a vision about africa in this message do you now believe paragraph 27 he says and here is what will take place the angel of the lord which come to me and told me to return to africa and he sat me down in africa and showed me a greater meeting than was there at the first time hallelujah many people look at this vision and many say it was not fulfilled and many have left the message because of that but i say they are the poor students of the scriptures hallelujah brother promises when i return back to africa there will be greater miracles than when i went for the first time there is a promise that there will be greater meeting than what happened here in devon hallelujah we'll take it there now the prophet says as we carry on my brother in this message it is the rising of the sun paragraph three five zero he says you all know where i'm going don't you know he says africa i've called you for a long time for years i've tried to get it back now a vision the spirit of the lord has prepared the way they said when those poor natives heard it that i didn't come the last time when i was there they laid on the ground day and night and moaned and cried and say lord what have we done thousands of them those people don't even believe they've got a soul they cried and they moaned and they cry who was he referring to he was referring to our forefathers they hurt the desire that brother branham should come back to africa and you remember the first when he came here he was in johannesburg and brother god said to him you need to get your debian because in devon everyone will have an opportunity to hear you ministering and when he was in jobac it was only a certain class that attended brother branham's meetings but the message of the hour is not for a specific class the message of the hour it is for everyone that believeth and during that time the government of the day did not want the people to meet but god wanted to break the protocol of that day and say i need all of them to be there i need a white brother next to an indian brother i need an indian brother next to a black brother i need them to worship god because this message will be a universal message hallelujah and we know what happened he came here in one just one prayer over 30 000 people got it delivered not a prayer line folks just one young white a man called hallelujah and as they gave a testimony of a young man that was working he was limping because his feet were uneven and they came before brother branham and brother branham laid hands upon him and the young man in no time he no longer limped he walked upright what was happening the gut that can heal was here hallelujah and we saw people the natives they came some of them were blind but brother branham prayed for them immediately they received to their side we know that during that time the ambulances were bringing the sick to the raised course the hospitals were being emptied out there is a deliverance taking place that the whole day but and bring him today in this message my brother in the message ashamed of him he says this is one of the highest moments of my life i've waited 15 years of this time two weeks ago i was under great anticipation believing that i would get to come and have a meeting but when i got to the visa it was restricted i almost had a heart attack i wanted to come so bad but i still believe this is very profound but i still believe that true god will minister again in the name of the lord jesus among the people of africa god has promised to give us the desire of hearts that of my people want that he had when he was here but brother branham was taken of the scene and a lot of people they say the vision was not fulfilled but let me bring it to a scripture in the book of psalms chapter 22 verse 16. here david says for dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet now in the record of the life of david there was never a point where his hands and feet were pierced hallelujah but here the statements say they pierced my hands and my feet so if people want to leave the message and say the vision of africa was not fulfilled then you must leave the bible because here david say they pierced my hands and my feet his feet were never pierced but the students of the scriptures they understand it was not david speaking they understand that it was the messiah sticking through the mouth of death and the principle we take it our respect to africa and i will minister among african people it was not william branham that he was preaching it was the messiah preaching through william brennan today we are not expecting a kentuckian man to return but the one that used the kentuckian man he has returned to the shores hallelujah and somebody say oh he has returned where are the miracles let me give you something jesus is somewhere he's got multitude of people that are sick they're coming to him are squeezing they want to be praying he's called leprous he's got a and as he was there brother branham say they came as servant of a pharisee called sam simon and these seven came to jesus and said my master is inviting you on such and such a day do you mind to come and jesus said i will come jesus leaves crippled lepers sick people he goes to the house of the pharisee he gets it there and is sitting there in the corner the prostitute looked at him and said now is my opportunity and the prostitute went to buy a perfume and came back to unwind to the feet of jesus and wiped the feet of jesus and she got a deliverance of the soul now tell me which is a greater miracle the miracle of a person walking out of a wheelchair or a person that is being delivered on the soul if i get delivered from a wheelchair i can die without god and i will go to hell hallelujah if i get delivered because i'm dumb and i speak and i don't repent i will go to hell but my brother once ideally get delivered on the soul there is no point of return even god himself cannot disown me hallelujah forward i go and no one will stop it the devil will never stop me demons will never stop me why because i got it delivered on the soul and god does not save you today to lose you tomorrow there are people that today as i'm preaching in this church they are infallible i said there are people in this church that are infallible there are people in this church that will never go back to the world no matter what is happening they will never go back to the world because themselves and god they are so intertwined the devil will never separate to them hallelujah and i'm glad that i can say i'm one of those people folks i'm not you are not expectating the message you have become the message of the hour the spectators are leaving but the partakers are not leaving if you join to the message you will return back but if you become the message you will never call back there are people that are criticizing the message i said they are too late because those books now have become human beings hallelujah how are you going to change it back christ is the mystery of god reveal is now working on two feet the invisible union of the bride is now working on two feet we have reached a point of no i return we are together here always wanted to stop god's move yes hallelujah abraham sees a character he sees the three engines coming to his household and he identifies to abraham according to the time of life i shall return their wife sarah shall have a son hallelujah one day when abraham came from the slaughter of the kings he meets him again it was melchizedek walking through the pages of the bible one day jacob met him he wrestled with him when the moses said i have got the desire to see the lord and the lord says stand behind the rock you will see me passing by and moses sees a back patch of a man hallelujah we see him through the pages of the bible the hebrew children they were thrown into the fire but when nebuchadnezzar went to look the first man was in the fire who was dead it was god walking through the pages of the bible and that same one became the lord jesus christ and after he became the lord jesus christ the devil took him to the cross and the devil crucified him and put him into the grave and he thought he was finished but you can never stop god's move within 72 hours he was on his way to him house i said you can never stop god's move the same god that was here in devon is still here tonight oh brother the same angel that was here is still here tonight if you've got sugar diabetes that same angel can deliver you from your sugar diabetes if you've got a lost child that child can be reconciled by the power of the spoken way but brethren we've got to confess we've got to confess and our conviction will bring our circumstances in subjection to our confession if you say you are a failure you will be a failure but if you say i am a victim by grace i am healed by grace we must learn to ignore the symptoms and focus on the word of god and the lord that god that delivereth you from all the sicknesses frogs from their all sicknesses greater than all of them is here greater than moses is here greater than solomon is here greater than covet 19 is here greater than sugar diabetes here greater than all of them is here do you hear me brethren this god is able this god delivered you will see what in the message only believe the prophet says if we who are acquainted with the supernatural we just take a man where the man in his senses is limited to his senses but a man and his spirit is unlimited your terrestrial body is limited but you in your spirit you are unlimited the tree of knowledge can only climb so far and it breaks back but the tree of life goes on forever and how that science has taken men further with his five senses than we have with his soul this is an indictment church science has taken a man further with his five senses than we have with his soul we've got untapped resources where all things are possible folks let me say this every challenge of the hour the church has got a solution for it i say every challenge of the hour the church has got a pose has got a solution for it but here is a problem a man in his scientific thinking he believes it's unlimited but a man that has received the message of the hour he is doubtful a man hallelujah in his scientific thinking when covet hit he believed that i will get a vaccine hallelujah and you and i we must have faith that god will provide the solution are you still with me here the the scientists are working day and night to find that means when the world is saying all children are on rehab they are struggling with drug addiction we must not join the world we must not complain like the world we must tell the world there is a solution we must tell the world that we've got the solution the problem the church is ashamed to take a stance and brethren say you will never see god until you bring him to a showdown i say you will never see god until you bring him to a showdown and when you bring god to a showdown you've got to live your thinking brother branham said the supernatural thinking is to leave your own mind and get to the mind of christ what does it mean you're going to speak things that are ought i say you are going to speak things that are odd and when you speak things that are old people are gonna say you have lost your mind but at that moment god said that's my man that's my woman she believes in me he believes in me and let me tell you something brother but brother makes a profound statement he said god will back up even a hypocrite if a hypocrite if his weight is at stake how much more you are not a hypocrite you are the son and a judge of god you are not a hypocrite you left the things of the world you embraced the message of the hour you live according to the word of god how much more when you say this shall happen but many times we are afraid hallelujah better than the message influence paragraph serving brother branham says god's power is limited to your faith in it you say he said that's the only limit it has is your faith tonight my question would be what do you desire from the lord what is it that is in your heart that you've got a request and you know it you have been battling and say lord i need this i want to say tonight god can meet you at your point of need and i say this god that i'm preaching about is unlimited this god demonstrated through the life of brother where he took a sex sex-born individual and said william branham what you need and he said i need to the squirrels and willem branham stood today and god said you i will not speak them you will um bring them you will bring the squirrel into the manifestation and willem branham stood like god stood in genesis 1. this was a man born by charles and ella branham and william branham stood there and said let there be listen to what you say god said how many do you need and he said i need you three hallelujah and brother since let there be a squirrel and there was a squirrel when he said i thought it was a vision i rubbed my eyes hallelujah i shot to the square i went to it i found it bleeding and it said the vision does not bleed and if you say i picked up the squid i was ready to go and god said no wait a minute you said how many do you want you know what when he said i needed three three were manifested in the supernatural realm they were waiting to be dropped down in the physical realm some of your blessings are there in the supernatural realm hallelujah god is waiting for you to bring them down to the physical realm and tonight the devil must not stop you the devil must not say it's just a church service it's just a minister it's not just a minister it's not just salmon it's a reality and if you take god in his way god will do the miraculous in your life and wilhelm branham stood there and said right now now i want to do something impossible as a hunter i know a squirrel will never be on the sacramento tree but today i'm unlimited under the unlimited god in an unlimited background i'm gonna call the squirrel to be on the sacramento tree and he said let there be a squirrel on a succumber tree and there was a squirrel on the soccer mall tree and there was another one he shot them and he went back home oh folks there was no chimera there was no selfie there was no evidence it was willem branham and william brennaman but when he began to narrate as he was narrating what god was doing sister haiti at the corner there a weird woman poor woman she listened and she listened and she said brother branham one thing is nothing but is the truth and god said sister haiti said the right thing and brother abraham stood up and said the same god that i was with in the wilderness is here in this room and said sister haiti ask whatever you want i shall give it to you sister say what masaya say here is your sister aries she's sitting on a wheelchair here is your parents they are old head sisterity requested that my i need my parents as young people they would have turned back to being young people again but as a mother one day it will be gone when i'm gone if i ask for the healing of sister eric she will die but the greatest desire that i have brother branham is the salvation of my two boys william branham stood there and looked his sister hit in the eye and said sister haiti i give you your children in the name of jesus christ and folks for as long as eternity stands those children will make it into eternity because there was a prophetic utterance over their lives but tonight i'm here the same god that was in the wilderness the same god that was in the sister at his house the same god that was young david is here right in phoenix [Applause] tonight folks that same god is here but the same god is looking for you as i'm preaching right now the table is whispering into your ear and says nothing refuse the devil's report tell the devil you are a liar i came to the house of god i know that there is a god i know that there is a god that can meet me at my point of need don't be afraid folks to testify about god god is looking for people that can testify before they are granted to their healing god is looking for people that can testify it reminds me of a blind man that said brother say you can see he went away he was still blind but every time you say thank god i can see and everybody made more career of him and everybody talked about him but one day he went to the barber and as they were busy cutting his head hallelujah the man the power the boy said angela had that you had to you went to that holy roller meeting and i heard that you said you can see they were trying to mock him but a man was not discouraged with a towel on his shoulders hallelujah in this message here in life paragraph 19 he says now now when the brethren i hope you don't mind if i take off my jacket the devil is in trouble amen now in the message here in life paragraph 19 brother brandon say now brethren now when the brethren received the baptism of the holy ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but brethren it's wrong there is no summit to god's power brother there are people that say we hate heaven there is nothing that can surpass david but i'm here tonight to say there is no summit to god's power he said there is no submit to god's power we move on and on and on is the unlimited resources of god has never been tapped yet oh brother you mean after devon there are still resources that are untapped you mean after speaking the squirrels into existence there are results that are still untapped let me carry on here i'm getting excited he said we move on and on and on is the unlimited resources of god has never been tapped yet and it says blessings and powers that we know nothing about is never being even revealed to the archangels and is laying just ahead for his church that will believe for i has not seen ear has not had neither has it entered to the hearts of men what god has for them in store that love him there are still greater blessings are down the road there's still greater miracles down the road we need to move on and on hallelujah you know science is not science is not stagnated you know the technology that you think is the technology is outdated we got gps we thought it was break groundbreaking that thing was used by the military many years back and actually what you deem to be modern technology it's an outdated technology in the military once they don't need it anymore they give it to everyone but i'm looking at this spiritual army and i say what do you have tonight hallelujah and i can say you cannot say science can can outrun the church of god it can never outpace the church of god amen brother in the midfield hidden live paragraph 19. he says so let's move up and claim our eyes hallelujah you can have rights but if you claim them they lay dormant tonight there are privileges that you must lay amen you can have money in the bank and it is left in your name but if you don't go to the bank to claim it it remains there hallelujah and brotherhood says there are untapped resources there are interpretive blessings there is untapped power you can have access to that are you still with me you can access that but today the church is timid brother probably says the greatest problem with the church the church is fearful we are full of fear what's going to happen tomorrow and as a result we get worried and worried and brother says there is no value in worry he said if i'm going to die tomorrow and what about it what good is it but it says tell you there is a reservoir of god's power hallelujah brother let's move up and claim our eyes as god god opens the gaze and swings out the welcome mate let's move on up into deeper depths and never colonize ourselves to organize ourselves and to get into a place where where this is we shall believe this and that's all let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from god ah but are you here don't put a comment a full stop there put your calm and say to be continued if god blesses you today don't say that's it the same god that bless you today he will bless you tomorrow the same god that delivers you he will deliver your children hallelujah and you mothers today we are looking for a spiritual sense of militancy amen the devil cannot keep on snatching children away from us and we just accept that we are in the end time you know how children are no we don't know what we know you can bind that demon what we know a mother who is prayerful god will back up that mother oh mothers are you in the building brother brethren say even the grave will never stop your prayer he said even after you are gone your prayer will go after your children and tonight they say keep on praying for them and say lord they will come at the right time hallelujah how many believe the holy ghost is here and if your child is not in church the holy ghost can go where your child is right in a tavern drinking the holy ghost can go there and the boy while he's drinking it drops down the bottle and says something is moving why the prayer of the mother the prayer of the father but the problem the church has surrendered the neighbor is an unbeliever she complains about her children you are joining her complaining like she's complaining do you think she's gonna come and accept what you have accepted no you must tell hey that our children both of them are on drugs but the difference is that every night as a godly mother before i go into bed and kneel down and pray to god at some point in time my child whether she likes it or not whether he likes it or not god will bring him back into the fold are you here mothers are you here mothers the devil cannot come and run amok in our houses there is enough power you are limited in your spirit i say you are limited to your spirit oh another quotation brother adrian brother branham says when a man is connected with god he is he is as powerful as god is powerful oh tonight i'm preaching not to a denomination i'm preaching to the bride of jesus christ you are married to jesus christ in community of property his blessings are your blessings his power is your power you know when a woman is married to a rich man and she goes to the gatewall mall to shop she's not just sorry hallelujah she comes pushing a trolley full maybe it's two of them hallelujah she's not nervous she's not got no calculator because while she's married to a man of unlimited results wait a minute let me go and get what i have forgotten she goes and get even the more expensive item what is happening this woman knows who she is married to but i'm looking at the church of the living god married to jesus christ but they are afraid to swipe and tonight it's a lot of swipe healing is here let us fight deliverance here let us why bless inside let us fly don't ever limit god are you still with me amen i'm having a good time i must not i must not keep you the whole night i'm having a good time brother oh my then listen to what there's some way i'm going brother brahman says in the message the deity of jesus christ paragraph one one zero he says now friends i know that it should be the truth i know people don't realize who you are that is the problem today there is spiritual amnesia people don't know who we are we have forgotten who we are but i'm here maybe to help you by god's grace to be delivered from that amnesia you are not just an ordinary church the message is not just an ordinary doctrine the message is jesus christ in the revealed where they form he'll say friends i know that to be the truth i know people don't realize who you are every person in here can live above sin folks every every person amen amen every person tonight in this building young ones the middle aged the elderly you can live above sea that's a great america to live above sin amen hallelujah amen and subdue satan because you know i'm a son and a daughter of god the power is in your identity he says you you will make mistakes but god the blood of christ will forgive you father forgive them for they know not what they do the same power of christ that was hung on calvary's cross the same god that raised him up on the day of the resurrection he's not in america today he's not in jeffersonville tonight he's not in jobac tonight folks i don't believe myself god that i will admire him at a distance no if i go to a church i believe god is in my church i believe god is in my family the same god that was in jeffersonville is in my family that same power of christ that was hung on calvary's cross the same god that raised him up on the day of the resurrection is in you you that's quite the holy ghost then if the same you know the problem today the devil recognizes what is in you more than you recognize what is in you the devil is more afraid of you and you don't realize why he's not he's afraid of you have you ever been a son of a top cop and maybe you go somewhere there are criminals and you introduce yourself from madiva and all of a sudden it clicks to the criminals marijuana is the top cop and then all of a sudden they run away but you don't know why they are running away that's exactly how the church is the devil is afraid of what is inside of you hallelujah there is something within you that binds demonic powers the same power that was in the race cause tonight is not in america it's not in the grave where brother branham was buried he's in the in the believers tonight but that power remains untapped because why a lot of times we concentrate on things that are not important i hope we are together brother branham says that he didn't tell me what time do we what time do we lose all right you know he never said brother be careful you might carry on until four o'clock and somebody falls asleep and falls like the days of paul i won't go there amen now the prophet says listen to this redemption in completeness in joy paragraph 134 he says look he speaks of the early church they were full of new wine that's right the one that comes from god out of heaven he says did you ever see a drunk man he is just in love with everybody have you ever seen a drunk man he's just in love with everybody you see he doesn't care that's the way a man is when he gets drunk on the spirit the bible says be not drunk on strong wine with excess but to be drunk on the spirit the spirit of god makes you so drunk you forget all your enemies oh the reason we remember our enemies is because we are sober a sober man knows his enemies will coach his enemies what they did to him but not a drunk man a drug man just want to hug everybody hallelujah then he carries on he says that the spirit of god makes you so drunk you forget all your enemies and everything and everybody's in love with you he don't care about who's standing around you you're the biggest man in the counter right then i don't care you have you ever seen a drunk man he believes is the best thing you can't hide him during a family gathering he wants to greet everyone he wants to tell everybody about what he thinks hallelujah he's not afraid of anyone he thinks that he's on top of the world and brother brennan say if a drunk man in the nature can be in such a manner how much more drunk men in the spirit sometimes we are afraid because we are too sober somebody was talking about a rat and a cat and it says this red was running from a cat but it fell into a jar and the child had an alcohol and the rat sipped the alcohol and when it came out of the jar the same rat that was running away from the kid started looking for a cat because now it was a drunk rat oh brother you run from the table but once you are in judged by the spirit from above you are no longer afraid of satan now you are looking for that demon and say where is that demon so that i can deal with amen amen brother let's carry on amen brother brennan speaks something here as i'm gonna work towards the clothes and the message israel in the church paragraph 13 this is very very important brother branham says let me ask this let me give you an illustration here is one sphere here's another sphere and here is another one maybe brother let's just go one forward a bit we'll come back he speaks about those fears there's one sphere another sphere and another sphere will come to the diagram so that you understand what i'm talking about then it says now down here is the nominal church maybe let's leave it there like that he says now down here is the nominal church now up in here here is the sublime there at the top and it says here is where we are supposed to be right next door to heaven where the powers of god is leaking down all right it drops on this drops down through to this one then drops through to this one this is the nominal church at the bottom it just goes on just old cold professions and a little really ritualistic affair that is the nominal church they just get the very slight drippings then the next church up here is full gospel get some of the blessings but they go off into isms and if you've got to if we've got to lift up into the next fear here before we can ever have rapture that's exactly right you've got to get up in that before we can ever have it that's true are you i hear church tonight there is a nominal church they are just a little ritualistic all to con call called confessions and there is a full gospel they receive a little bit of drippings of god's power but there is a sublime church that is next to the door of heaven they've got access to the heavenly power and tonight we don't want to be a nominal church we don't want to be an average church folks we don't want to be church a child where the sinners just come in and go back the same whether she come in and they go back they say brother brethren say this coming a time where the sick will get healed without being prayed for by the atmosphere in the church during the period of grace right there before a song service the power of god moves into the church and somebody say i had a cancer is god i had a diabetes is god hallelujah and he said the sinners will repent without being preached to before the minister comes already people's hearts are ready for god oh brother i'm looking forward to that time and if that time is tonight let it be so the atmosphere where the church is in an atmosphere hallelujah we don't want to be full gospel they're going to isms breaking brotherhood spirit of camps i know that pastor one greater than pastor we are not sober and so an odd wrong man greets everyone a drunk man loves everyone and tonight by god's grace let god help us to be drunk in the spirit let us love even the people that are wrong and pray for them for their deliverance let us not have a wall at all let us reach out to everyone because we are drunk in the spirit then we become a sublime church that's when we are merited to him in community of property his power is our power his blessing is our blessing then we become god's conduit of power you know brother adri you are at ikea you know what is happening if you dare want to order kia from where it comes where does it come is it japan korea sorry korea you can order care from korea even if you write them an image they will tell you that no sorry in durban we've called our agency they've got everything that you need you can't even order a part from korea they will tell you that no when we produced your car we even sent the parts to our sole distributor go to them tonight heaven people are going to heaven saying hang on down there there is a sublime church down there there is my god's agency of power this church has got the power even to give new paths i say this patch church has got the power to give new paths brother branham holds a young girl and he prays for the angel who was blind and before he could open his her eyes brother brother said to the young kid what color of eyes do you want hallelujah the young girl thought that you know blue eyes are so unique i need not brown one i need a blue eyes and brother will say in the name of jesus christ hallelujah now it's not heaven it's a man on the stage he's giving a young girl the blue eyes and say in the name of jesus christ receive your blue eyes hallelujah tonight i don't know what you need maybe somebody needs a new heart i say heaven has given us the power to give you a new heart somebody needs a new spot heaven has got the power folks i'm preaching about the creative power here i'm preaching about the creator here this is not just a denomination where we come and swap over all stories and become disappointed no sir we've got the power tonight and whatever you know john and peter they looked at the men and said such as we have we give it to you in the name of jesus christ stand up and walk and tonight you the church you must tell the world such as you have such as you need we give you in the name of jesus christ there is enough power in the church right now for deliverance brother branham says we are preaching here there are images that are going through the building yes and they say you need a gadget to pick up the pictures in that dimension and bring them to the naked eye similarly as we are preaching right now there are angels in the building tonight brother branham says sometimes you come to church you feel very much discouraged and it says the service is going on you feel a bit warmed up he says right there is your glorified body rubbing against your terrestrial body there is an invisible audience in the building right now that same anger that was with willam branham that same angel that was the endeavor is here tonight in the building i said the angel is in the neighborhood i said what he did then he can do it tonight folks we're not just under a dead religion recycling old stories yes they are great it's great what god did in 1951 we admire what god did in india but furthermore we need to see what he's doing tonight look look at it look at the man of god when he's got confidence in his god he lands in india he kneels down he prays he say oh lord i claim every spirit i claim every soul here in india in the name of jesus christ and he made a challenge to 17 religions and say if your god is a god that is true here is a man that has been worshipping a son all his life he has gone blind and the whole eyes are just white and brown say if any of your god can deliver this man i will turn around and worship that god but it says if my god cannot deliver this man write me on the back and say a false prophet it's amazing that they will refuse to write on brother brennan's back there is a false prophet when he's still alive they want to write when he's dead he invited that ride it on my while he was still alive now he's gone you want to do it you are too late amen but brother said there was silence in that world he said you could have had a pin drop on the floor because why it was a challenge on me let this man receive his side right there before seventeen there's been a delegated authority hallelujah the same god that was here tonight is here and you can have your heart desire god bless you [Music] [Applause] maybe let's just say i'm only in this message but that song i love it i'm only in this message but how many in the message by grace god bless you my dear brother amen hallelujah amen give god a shout of praise amen blow the trumpet in zion sound the alarm on my holy mountain say the lord amen let's stand together oh bless the name of jesus hallelujah amen amen while the anointing is here right now hallelujah let's just sing that song only believe once and i want you to raise your hand by faith if you have a need right now amen and trust the lord and believe that you have already received what you have need of hallelujah [Music] only believe oh believe all things are possible all things are part if you can only believe [Music] [Applause] only [Music] can you take god at his word oh only believe all things all things they are possible it's possible because jesus is here jesus [Music] oh yes he is jesus is here and all things all things are possible

touch the m of his garment and say lord do not pass me by [Music] reach out like that woman who touched them of his garment come to him by faith like that centurion [Music] oh hallelujah and jesus marveled and he said i've never seen such great faith in all of israel and the centurion said speak the word only lord and tonight we say lord speak the word only and whatever you have need of right now brother branham taught us and he said there'll come a brother to come to you and he said brother i have need of rain and he said you will say i give you rain jesus i give you your salvation in the name of jesus hallelujah or if you have free to believe now then all things are possible before we pray i want you to love you tell him what you have to come and have an altar call right now but right where you are let that be your altar right now and you call upon the name of the lord and you say father i believe you are the same yesterday today and forever we refuse to leave you back in history
