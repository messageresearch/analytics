we shall we're a crowd praise the lord you see so uh you're going to be the crown bride amen with your king amen praise the lord he's worthy of all praise amen glory be to his name and i was thinking uh and i was going to say the scariest place for the preacher to be the scariest place for it you know why because our people make him scared some of them don't smile they don't say hey man you know just sit and stare honestly as a preacher when they come and stand here they're scared they see no response from you it's scary but when you smile and say amen and you know praise the lord they're always saying they're happy they know you're responding they know they're not talking to zombies you know zombies uh something moving but it's dead you know it's got no life in it so don't worry about that anytime the preacher stands anybody scared if the congregate will not response don't respond but anyway i'm happy this morning because of the word amen we got a positive word amen amen we know we have the word how many of you believe you are saved this morning if you don't believe me you're saying why what you're doing here see if we believe we're not saying we won't be here so we believe we are saying we believe god called us we believe god revealed his word to us praise the lord we believe we are the end time bride amen amen praise the lord shall we know god god never sent this message he never sent the prophet in vain you never break this word to such an extent for way but there's a bride here to receive it see there's there's religion there's people there's churches everywhere but god sent us a message praise the lord so we don't believe we are part of the group and i don't know what we began but we believe when we heard that word prays a lot you know i think some other prophet said we are learning from our theophany amen praise the lord see now maybe in this life here we get that despondent and you know we get the down hearted and we you know the flesh bed and all this thing but remember there's a spirit man see if the mushroom mustn't pay too much attention to the flesh man see if that's to get us down we worry people one day we're okay the next day we down you know grumpy but there's a spirit man there and the only thing that can quicken that spirit man is a word yes amen amen the word of god brings life sustain us praise the lord i'll be glad for that amen so pray god bless us even as we have gathered here and be blessed with the word and as long as god give us grace and uh we'll gather and worship him and give him glory and all the praise praise the lord we tend to our bibles the book of job writing about the book of job how many of you know what joel means i didn't know because i i when i read here i said no i want to see what joel means what's what's happening here so the bible tells me here the name joel means jehovah is god amen joe hell shiva is god and what does joshua mean she our savior see so whenever you see a name and it's it ends up with here el is god see so joe l he said jehovah is god praise god so we thank god for beings there that you know that even in names god is there see so we praise god and give him all the glory so we read from uh joel 1 1 to four and then joel chapter 2 verse 25 and i pray the lord bless us this morning and last week when i was closing the service i had three songs i want to sing and close the service three songs i started the first one and then i just i was able to take over and as i went through the door they finished the first one then he sang the next song i was going to sing and then he said in the third song i was going to say i said lord how can this be you know how can it be you know the very same songs that i was wanting to sing and you know you're saying those very same songs i said thank you lord must be something about it praise the lord so let's read uh joel chapter one one to four and uh just pray for all the believers that are not well and the people not working some of them are scared of this violence thing i remember my brother shabbat shall be prayer i think he went to newcastle with one of the workmates there and his wife got the violence or something so they've got the they're gonna do the test and honestly but he says no just stay at home just sort of wait for them to be tested and all this thing okay so it's uh contagious and you don't know who's got it and all this thing so just pray for them got to make a way for them and their brother has been uh for the hope has been a successful and we're just waiting for him to recover and we pray the next few days he'll be back home praise the lord so uh you know remember the devil will try and do anything with his body he can put you know the prophet said kansai is a demon right so he'll come into his body you'll do everything uh whatever way they take it but remember you can't affect the salt amen you do everything to this body but your soul is still trusting god amen and the believers around the world going to our trial time here we are a real uh preacher pastor creatures they're the messengers standing with the world together with the sun to make the then his wife is struck with a brain image then the doctor said no she's uh she's going to be a cabbage she'll never recover she won't move and everything but these brothers are prayer warriors together with ron spencer he was a tech brain tumor just a week or so after he was preaching there that he stuck with a brain tumor what the devil is trying to discourage not discouraging the people of god no but they're praying pray his wife is healed and the doctor said you know what she'll be a cabbage and won't move and all this thing so that's what the problem says don't believe what the doctor says we just believe god amen yes now donnie reagan put a request that is his daughter she's not a brain tumor and he's requesting from the church and praying so we thank god that uh you know when the bride get together and pray there's gonna be answers but that they don't want to attack this uh treasure don't don't worry it's better for us death is an open door amen amen that will get us into his presence so the devil doesn't know he's doing us a favor by by you know if he is going to take us away we're going to be in the presence of god praise the lord i'll be glad for that amen we must be positive you know like the prophet said the brother that preached for so many years and he was ready to die now and everybody was in the room there and he got up and shook hands with the believers that died long ago calling them by name amen praise the lord they're not dead they're there amen so don't worry what happens you know just thank god the soul is saved amen because the devil can't touch the soul amen he can do what he like with his body praise the lord joel chapter 1 the word of the lord came to joel the son of hezekiah gathers the old men and give here all the inhabitants of the land and this being in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the farmer worm had left and the locust eaten amen and that which the locust had left at the cankerwood meeting and that was the candy worm at left and the caterpillar eaten that's the roman now there's four insects what one left if the other one started as soon as that other one finished the other one left start defeating what was left and the last one hit what was left praise wrong so there's four insects here right and i was listening to this message and i was just rejoicing praise the lord because what i saw here i saw the seals yes amen here the four dead insects and then the four horse riders are dead amen amen and actually the way the prophet is preaching it here is preaching the seals but he was preaching this in april 1962 actually preaching the seals but 1963 the seals is actually open amen what was sealed up all the time so you was preaching the seals all the time we didn't know it was the seals see whatever is preaching about the antichrist and all these three it's a seals part of it praise the lord that should make us rejoice and then god here he brings out these uh whatever we like to call it uh illustrations in the old testament and makes it applied to the new testament see how those things are taking place in the old testament and it brings that makes it apply here to the new testament amen you know sometimes maybe once in a while i think god was like unfair because when jesus came he says he came to his own his own received him not now who was his own and it seems like we the gentiles had a second chance they rejected him and he blinded them and he came to the gentiles so it seemed like we were the second choice but now we were there all the time amen we were predestinated before the foundations of the world so we've not checked second chance amen the bride is not second chance amen i'd be glad for that so there are things here in the old testament applies to that new testament the problem said it's shadows and types see if you take all those sevens in the bible and all stepping there then let's go to joel 2 25. praise the lord you'll see the seals over here and you'll see the day we are living in and i will restore i will restore amen to you the years that the locusts get heated and the cankerworm and the caterpillar my great army which i sent among you great army amen he's going to restore so all these insects are hit off of the stream he's going to restore i'll be glad for that we're going to be restored and the message here the prophet preaches restoration of the bride tree restoration of a bright tree so before we go in the rapture we're going to be a restored church with the word of god so all the enemy tried to take down and tear down from the churches and all this thing the bride is the rest of our church amen so he says i'll send you like the imagine the prophet he'll turn our hearts back to their fathers amen your original faith praise the lord i'll be glad for them amen let's bow here as god's blessing upon the world we last brother lionel to pray as god's blessing upon the word amen amen thank you lord for the praise and worship yes [Music] yes we give you glory and praise amen thank you lord yes praise the lord amen amen you will receive it so what is the bride the bride is the rest restored church amen there's churches out there praise wrong but the bride is restored amen we'd like to hear some amen because we know you're hearing the word i want you to be as happy now as you're going to be lunchtime you know when you're eating your chicken just now you're going to be happy i want you to be happy like that huh what jesus i will restore amen all that this insects have eaten i will restore praise the lord so that is what the bride is the bride is restored in there the word of god see now the prophet said yeah uh restore restore means to bring death restore bring back see all that they have eaten you bring back right and now these insects now god is using them as insects right but it's it's a it's a it's a system it's it's people it's spirits right but god is using them as the insect and then you look at this uh at the farmer where the locusts they look very similar see the papaw my locust looks very similar they can't do one see there's two of them look very similar one one is like the the locus and one look like a moth then you got the the palmer worm and they got a caterpillar see so these three these four insects are heating from the tree and one is eating the leaves the leaves of the tree the other one eats the fruits of the tree craves a lot right so the right what was eaten by the roots it was eaten by the roots that it destroyed if you know about dabbing and things plants in your garden if you see the trees drying up and you look at it right in the roots it's drying up no like plucking and throwing away it's not going to grow amen see so the life is in the room so restore means you bring back see enforced amen getting back to its rightful honor where it belongs now we spoke last week on redemption and reconciliation how god has redeemed us and we are reconciled but now we talk about restoration praise the lord redemption and reconciliation is what he did for us now the redemption is destroyed his church that the enemy came to attack the enemy came to destroy and plunder he said i'm going to destroy it and that's what the bride is amen he's taken he said what is going on he's going to chop out of those denominations a bride and she's going to be destroyed by the world praise the lord so that's what we are see we can't believe these things but if we are saved and we know we are the bride we believe what the prophet is bringing the word to us praise the lord that will understand these things right so to bring back to its original position therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner and can wander around anywhere but to restore he should bring it back to who really owns it and in order to do this we have a right to enforce there is a law we have a right to enforce the law because god has made it such he's got a law about it amen we can enforce the laws of god amen and it's going to work right like somebody stole some property and they're holding the primary captive that you can take the law and go to this person and the law for name somebody can't steal your property and click oh the title deed shows you are the owner you own that property amen see so if somebody stealing them was restoring back to you it belongs to you praise the lord so that's what he had to be done to the church of god he stole the church of god destroyed the church of god right from the from the holy days when god's church was full of the holy spirit on the day of pentecost amen and uh after jesus was crucified and they were hiding over there they always scared for the life but they were when they were full of the holy spirit they came out into the streets and then they started preaching the gospel and people were from different parts of their uh world over there and when pete and all started to preach and they all heard them in the whole town and they were speaking in tongues and they were you know acting like they were drunk and the people said listen yeah these men were drunk but look what i applies not for the new testament what did peter say no this is joel's prophecy amen joe chapter 2 amen your young man will see vision all men will read peter is referring to what's happening on the day of pentecost to joel's prophecy you read that second period chapter 14 to 16. sorry second the book of acts acts chapter 2 14-16 he said this is joel's prophecy they're not drunk as you suppose they follow the holy spirit and it says god said he will send his spirit and they will be full of the spirit amen so jenna says enforce then we have the privilege to enforce upon satan the claims that god give us we got a right to say we have a right to take the baptism back in the name of the lord jesus christ amen we've got the right to say one god manifested in three dispensations father son and the holy spirit is lord jesus christ see what the enemy did now we got our right to enforce the law and say it's god father son holy spirit and all the other teachings of lost through the ages we got the right to come and claim it because god has sent his brother to bring this world up restoration back to us no matter if the others don't want to believe it it's not sent for the others praise the lord it's sent for the bride they do not believe it at all and say lord how can a snake talk and all these things and everything else but the bible says it was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field and he was talking huh yes he was in a snake crawling on the floor and talking to him no he was standing there like a man he was between the animal kingdom and the human kingdom and he was talking praise the lord then after that god put the curse on him to go crawling on his belly and eat the dust of the earth praise the lord see so the the word he said to the bride the restored church francis i'll tell you what if you are not eating from this world if you're not living up this world except in the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood we're going to be dead that is the truth if you're not fishing on this world you're going to die amen this word brings life to us yes amen we live by the word of god amen so we must take this word and live by it amen amen prophesy again when we come to church we are promising again when we're preaching we are prophesying again the true word of god praise the lord see so now we have a right to enforce it praise the lord therefore we have a right to force these claims upon satan and say give it back amen he has to do it because he can't take god's agent the holy spirit go right down our knees and say it's just say the lord he's got to give you that that's all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it see so the the one that are deceived by satan is holding all to his false teaching so you can show them where this teaching started the false teaching in the godhead and the baptism no they'll hold on to that but we got claims to take it back we said the first original church baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and we the last church got to baptize also in the name of the lord jesus christ the first that believe in one god amen and the rest of them were territorials we have a right to come back and say we believe in one god i remember the prophet said not true god and three god one god we have a right to take it back praise the lord so that's what we're saying if we don't live by this word we're gonna die literally mean you must feast on this world at home you must play the tents you got it on your phones now amen you got it all the time with you you can be busy but you can be listening to the world amen doesn't mean you say you're busy you can't listen to the word yeah sisters while you're in the kitchen over there you can you can you can listen to the word that's right play the tape on the let me play it's easy that you got your phone by you the tape the messages are there you can google any message and everywhere and play basic music while you're washing the dishes the brother said the woman's place is in the kitchen huh praise the lord did he say that yeah he said the woman's place is in the kitchen coming to the house waiting for the husband to come remember his meals and she can do the dishes she can be washing the clothes she will be singing she could be praising god all the time if you don't live on this world you're going to die praise the lord we will spend too much time on whatsapp and google and this and that let's come on the world you're going to die you must spend time with the world amen you must eat this word what did john said what did the angel say to john we're always talking about that take this book and eat it so when you are listening here you are eating it amen you know reading is different now reading you must go sit over there and you gotta you gotta you gotta accept and read no but when you got you listening there you can do your work praise hello when you're driving in your car you can listen to the world praise the lord friend covered by the hearing getting of the word of god amen so we must live this word amen when you are living on this word and you are feasting on this word is building rapturing faith amen praise the lord i feel anointed now when you are listening and feasting you are building rapturing faith we know we're going to listen to the news once in a while too much news is no good too now their politics abuse is no good they're just politics and fighting and trusting him and who's going to be president and next and this president is a madman now and and uh he cut his mental and all this thing we're not worried about that that's not going to pull rapture in fact no you stay with the word rapturing faith god's in a providence and all his life you can stay in wait upon the lord and go into the woods that it's all the time word word word word word he was not interested in nothing one time he was a boxer i think uh 1718 he was a boxer huh that never continued with him when he got transformed and renewed it was word word word word word amen he could have been a very popular guy to be a boxer you know and win you know fights and get money and wealth and riches like the rest of them no but he surrendered his life to christ and when he went into the woods willingness it was to relax and be away from the people and all and also to get inspiration from god to bring the messages brought with a great price amen that he surrendered his life so we must take this word and eat it praise god feast on it rejoice with them thank god for it glorify his name and i tell you the prophet tells us you just be saving god listening to the word rejoicing all the time and you'll just materialize into the new body amen it's going to happen one morning you're going to walk by your mother like you normally do that when i walk by the mother always get really excited [Music] i think you know look at all the gray air now and my teeth is crooked and and all this thing you know and one day i'm gonna look over there wow can you imagine you're looking over there are you gonna say wow that you're gonna look over there and you're changed some of you're going to scream especially the sisters they scream can you imagine that can you imagine sister sarah going by that way [Music] and my wife she i know she can scream one small good grade yes he screams huh all the sister is going to scream all the brother is going to be wondering what's happening then when you go then look there by side i don't know whether you're going to scream you might grab it you say oh honey thank you we we we're living home does it happen that then he crashed the first rise we're not going to see them the way they went amen and yet we'll know them and i was thinking about that you know something strange we get whole our bodies change they're getting great we're falling they're falling you know but you know one thing our voice will change oh god you can maybe somebody for you after a very long time you'll you'll recognize the voice some old person yeah the voice don't change i don't think it changed much it's still the same praise the lord so you're going to meet somebody one day and they're going to come and greet you and you say hey you know what i recognize his voice praise the lord i'll be glad for that amen so this one here is a world changing world see so we're gonna go a little faster and say now that there's these insects here that is heating from the church and the frog said they attacked the church and they started eating from the church and uh and all the and the fruits first the first insecure lost i'm not gonna go into the bible and explain to you must go up and listen to it the long message but go and study it add the fruits now look at the fruits that was in the church nine spiritual gifts then he became an editor of the church they no longer believe in those things see then he started attacking the leaves the prophet said leaves means divine healing some don't want to believe in healing some chapters say even if somebody got healed i won't believe it i think especially their jehovah's witness they don't believe in healing then the enemy came here the part that protecting the tree amen then it went to the pub the life that is all refr uh referring to the church that once was there it had all these things in it while these insects came and hated her now you know the locals here are causing a havoc in parts of africa ethiopia and somalia and they can go there and eat the whole field of god or whatever they're planting destroyed see so god is using that to show the enemy and he brought distraction to the church and he said i will restore amen see saruman the bride is a restoration amen we never give up hope that's why when when people get sick we pray more amen they don't say no i'm serving you god i'm preaching your word and all this thing and why do you struck me look at these

midst doing this restoration amen the prophet said what god set in order and all these laws and everything they will operate nothing will change it amen nothing gonna change the operation of god's laws praise the lord then he says if god can do that for the for the running of the universe and all this thing how much more we the devil can't attack us the devil can't come against these laws

there's no better condition the law of god's word makes it a pain amen forces the issue and say give it back amen he says oh if you could just think of that a minute false is it regardless of condition no matter what the condition is the law of god's word fosters the condition to cope with his word praise the lord so if people can believe and and hold on to the promises of god god will make his word come to pass amen they talk about florence nightingale was sticking with tb or whatever and was looking like a matchstick there was gonna die and they wanted the problem to come but there was no time for him to come to south africa now look at the faith of the people now he can't come to south africa but on his journey he's gonna be in england so they flew to england praise a lot they flew her to england and she was you seen the picture there the prophet was in south africa she's like a matchstick there and khan and she was actually can't eat she was going to die and everything else and also when she was there she said they're telling the prophet no she she wants you to pray for her to die and he said i can't pray for it to die amen amen you know wherever jesus was there was no death amen they resurrected him when he passed boy there was a first bar that was taking a little lead that died and he stopped there he raised him up gave him back to the mother amen so he says and i can't pray for you to die and then starting to touch the road and while there was praying there the jump came and sat by the window on the ledge unusual for a dog to come there and you know what the dog represents the holy spirit and then they pray for and everything else prays a lot and they got a picture she's completely whole made wow she's all again you can't come against

for you see but we must believe god's word you see this is all the enemy took away from the church i don't have to pray anymore you know god don't listen to you god is not going to answer you you know let's just uh live our life and let's die no god won't go against his own word and stay with his word right then he goes on to say here now so no matter what condition and then he talks about cutting himself then when when amy malek took sarah's wife god told him you better restore her back otherwise the whole kingdom is going to be white house amen he told him that restore give the man back his wife he's my prophet and then also he must pray for you otherwise you're gone huh look at it abraham found grace in the eyes of the lord amen went and did the wrong and god said no you must pray for the guy now god split confidence in him amen praise the lord so we stay with the word god has got confidence in us amen that's amazing stay with that word see okay so what i'm going to do here now i'm going to just keep cutting cutting and draining and i really want to let you go off early because i want you to enjoy the chicken right now maybe we get it from the phone here now and uh caleb can pick it up there see so what is this word i will destroy did we destroy this end time amen he was here restoring yes amen for everybody to see he was here in the pilot of fire he was here in the cloud he was here in the whirlwind he was here son of man restoring bringing that word back to the church okay the message restoration of the bride three he said the evening lights the bible said will shine in the last days the evening light is the same light in the west that was the same light that was in the east the same light the child in the east that brought forth the first church that the roman cut down by the pain and worship and so forth in the evening light is the same light notice the same light the first light started in the east same light as in the west right the enemy tried to cut down and destroy and what's the evening light come out to do what is the evening light for to restore amen and what is the evening light is this message what does that even like to do restore amen you get it the evening light is for the same purpose the morning light was for to restore what was cut down by the dark ages now what happened in the black ages take the seals now huh 68 million christians were killed preaching the seals yeah but he's not telling us it's the seals because the sales open 63. even if you read the church book that church enters the seals amen for them walking in the midst of the churches and the antichrist was there attacking and everything else killing that but he was there so the dark ages through rome coming in the dark ages to the room god is going to restore by shining forth the evening light so what is this blessing it's an evening light it's not a church denomination that's why we got no affiliation with church denomination they are not part of god's word the revealed restored word you take anybody that can open the bible they can they can preach all the stories in the bible that's why they're preaching things in their bible but god has opened the world that was healed there was thing that was not spoken of the holy spirit brings that word and reveals it to the blind the church god works in mysterious ways now okay we know the first four oscillators went by still writing in the payloads isn't it the fourth stage the next one souls under the altar what are they waiting for how long how long must we wait then he said no wait because your brother also must be avenged just like you were must wait so the souls are waiting there the rider is in his fourth stage payloads waiting to be fully manifested in the tribulation time the pride will be gone now first they're under the altar so the sixth seal is tribulation who sets that sixth seal in motion the problem said moses and elijah the next one is the seventh seal but now i'll come before the sixth seal the seventh seal revelation 10 and the prophet said revelation 10 and revelation 8 is connected amen amen amen how come before the 6th seal the 7th seal is made on and he says who is that seventh seal it's christ see he says you see that notable angel christ amen so before the tribulation come and the prophet said this messenger is the time of the earth at the time that this angel is coming down of revelation 10 amen so god is not working in a sequence of one two three four five six seven before the tribulation he's got to get the bride ready to go before the tribulation so he comes down with the hopeful book the word reveal to the bride so she can go up in the rapture then the tribulation can you see that now we're still waiting for the sixth seal but the seven seal is already open that's why he said he's a muslim nobody knows it here it's a not a mystery to the bride he's come down he showed himself this whole message is a sixth is the seventh seal christ and the prophet said it's not me yeah i may be standing here 1933 i was there but it wasn't only me amen it is him praise god so we thank god for opening our eyes we can see these things and we are restored amen yes so that's right when people don't understand who you are now because the way you go to which church you go to a pastor ronnie ronnie i don't know that guy i don't know a guy you know but if you tell them uh if somebody said joey governor everybody enjoy girls everybody knows tony if you say ej woodley okay he's late but everybody know ej won't you but i'm saying romney he said hey that guy we don't know man i mean how come you know him now where is the church now we're there in a town's manner what chance you got now we've got some tim shacks here what your guy's in it covered by a carport look at them about stone bridge now something we've got a church like a factory producing what that's right that is true thank god the eagles like to eat the chicken they got a big one over there and you know the prophet saws so so right he says let one church bully enough then the other one want to build a bigger one then the other one want to build a bigger one now the first one started here in faith revival you didn't eat them being bullied thousands then that one came over there now wow you know what the golden old plot around there and you own the chicken take away and everything there then now that guy was across him now firm foundation big they're big but you know poor rainbow chickens now they've got small sheds for those chickens but for this other chicken now they've got big buddies they're breathing all good and everything else but they're dead they're not eating from the body when they're the son of man they're not a restored church but they all be so he said no but you're going to the police over there i mean what is good about the place you know we got the revealed word we got the restored word and the prophet i was listening in the same message he says the children of the free which is very few they're going in the rapture and he said the children the children of the born woman they're going to go into utter darkness god listen to it that there is no church has the word of god jesus christ yes see let's let's finish this again okay so restore the whole word again the full manifest manifestation of christ in his church and remember christ is nothing else for the world word word word now you're gonna be watching out for people even in the message now they're leaving the world and they want to concentrate on being emotional must be emotion have emotion and must fall down huh i tell you what we listen to one thousand one hundred two hundred one thousand two hundred some sermons not one of those messenger prophet fell down not one of the messenger people that he pushed down none of them but now it's coming in the message and the concentrating of being emotional and you know dance and everything else and and fall down and get up and and uh and then the the preachers now must coax them come on now you know and the more falling the more happy are they getting the process that's not the church it's the word so the church is not concentrating on the word and want all these fleshly demonstrations jesus is not a fleshly demonstration amen he is the word made manifest see that's what we must concentrate one day when the holy spirit want us to dance we'll dance there's a real holy spirit dancing amen like the way david danced he was rejoicing and rejoicing and rejoicing and he wasn't ashamed of nothing one day the holy spirit will fall i tell you what there'll be a real dancing amen that'll be a real holy ghost dance praise the lord so don't fall for all these things here it must be only the word see the world all the time destroying us again okay so everything that he did just exactly the way he did it will be again in the evening like see what i mean isn't that wonderful and to know we are living right here to see it now i'll be glad for the brother sisters the evening light exactly according to prophecy the evening light come out to restore what to restore what the bugs eat up it started growing and then what it do it denominated so god pruned them off wound them up laid them back let them go ahead and organize then the next one come up he wound them up laid them off the tree went on then he wound them up laid them off now one of these days they will be burned here we are one of these days will be burned bind up the organization but then what right in the top of the tree is where the fruit ripens first that's right right in the top of the tree so it's a top of the tree here that sees the evening light amen praise the lord i'll be glad for that so don't be wary of the message god has done a great work and the rest is up to him amen we just gotta believe and follow and serve him and look before him and and you know as far as possible don't satisfy this flesh man too much satisfy the spiritual man and the spiritual man to live on the word of god amen the flesh man will live on the things of this world sin and he'll only want to get you down but the bible says blessed are those who anger and dust after righteousness for their shall shall be filled so as long as you're you're thirsty after righteousness and and you know every time you're crying out oh lord i don't want to be in this condition lord i don't want to live and i i want to be a better person amen you're crying out blessed are though that i'm gonna thirst amen what you're doing you're angering and thirsting for a better life you're hungering and thirsty not to just live in this flesh amen yes amen so that then he says you shall be full we must be like david now as the art pattern after the waterproof so my soul longened out to thee all along amen he has a longing he had frogs he had failures but his heart was planting you know like the rabbit was looking for that water my soul is dusting after you that is our desire amen and we are we are trapped in this body here we need to get out of this body we will be yearning to get out of it and i tell you what those people that had the experience of coming out of this body and they were looking down they never had no pain they were completely different that thinking were different and they they got got highs they can see they've got years they can hear they've got mug they can speak yeah the testament is there how come the prophet now when when god gave him a preview he came out of there he was able to talk over there he was able to see huh we got a far keener side than our natural eyes we got spiritual eyes waiting amen we got a sight and hearing and speech and everything see so god's time is dealing for us to go home and you know he's going to set up his kingdom and we know he's going to be sitting down the throne of david in the millennium ruling and reigning amen one man so that's why the antichrist now is moving to have a one world government one world system everybody must look to him what is the ring you know each time he's ahead he knows all this who's going to come to christ see some of the bible says thessalonians 2nd thessalonians man of sin sitting in the temple of god huh what's satan ambition i want to be like the most like god i want to be worshipped and and he's got it for a time they don't know the worshiping satan when they deny his word their worshiping satan see the prophet said you can't be followed the holy spirit and deny the word say you'll you'll correspond you'll respond to the word see so god now is bringing us is going on time see he want to restore everything let me stretch exactly what happened let the church know exactly what he's doing prays a lot he's not working in a haphazard way see that's why he sent us his word now bring it to the bride i says here now noah had three rooms in his heart one room for the creepy things see the second room was for the falls but the top room was where the light was the light shine first never come on the first floor second floor but on the top floor and good thing no one never had windows in the side of the heart if you looked in the side of you see all floating carcass human and animals and every other kind how many of you seen the pictures of uh was in 2004 tsunami we saw the pictures of all the harbors that are full of dead bodies noah would have looked out there and saw all the people floating dead noah can only look up god can only look up to heaven and every day can only say thank you lord thank you lord we know in the flood he never looked the sides praise the lord so he says the light came from the top amen so what he says now the top floor the don't burn his fruit at the bottom a second like that it was all pruned off in the organization what's in the top part where i will restore say the lord i will send for the evening light it will bring back bring back the word make it manifest i will restore all that i promise all that i promise the same holy spirit will bring were the same signs i'll have a history a resurrection for the blind just the same as i had for the bridegroom see the evening lights come out to shine same as in the morning same sun same thing same light will produce the same fruit that they had there if you're shining on the same tree amen proof word now fulfilled i will restore save the lord praise the lord so this enemy went forth the prophet said four enemies went forth eaten from the tree then he said he said four of his men four stages to destroy four stages to bring life now listen closely don't miss the star there was four dead messengers what would you rather just close would you rather rather we go early congregation says no listen close now look there was four yet messengers kill the tree amen what was it farmer worm locust kangaroo caterpillar that right four messengers of roman devils that's the seals dogmas kill the tree one took its fruit one took his back one took his sleeve the back one took their life four messengers of dogma killed the tree all but the roots and the four messages of death kill the tree four messengers of life restores the tree amen do you get it amen for god said i will destroy and he's going to destroy her by four death messengers killed it then four life messengers will restore amen amen luther wesley
