[9:30] I'm bless
[9:34] name
[9:37] [Applause]
[9:44] hallelujah praise the Lord amen thank
[9:46] you brother Shan for amen sharing that
[9:49] song with us amen I believe it was more
[9:51] than a song Amen and you know the
[9:54] footsteps of the
[9:55] righteous are ordered of the Lord amen
[9:59] praise the Lord so let's turn to our
[10:01] Bibles amen even as
[10:04] we go to the word for amen little
[10:08] it's our witness ton that pray meeting
[10:10] amen amen so we can get together and
[10:13] pray there's some needs amen that we
[10:15] need to take to the Lord let's turn to
[10:17] Jude
[10:21] 1:3 amen everybody feeling good in the
[10:24] house of the Lord amen in fact my
[10:27] opening remarks I'm going to get to it
[10:29] now now is about trust vers Faith amen
[10:32] amen and I like how the spirit Works to
[10:36] bring these things out and the song Can
[10:38] Be Sung that way amen so J 1:3 it says
[10:42] beloved when I gave you all diligence to
[10:44] write unto you of the common salvation
[10:47] it was needful for me to write unto you
[10:50] and to exalt
[10:52] you that you should earnestly contend
[10:55] for the faith amen which was once
[10:57] delivered unto the same
[10:59] amen for were there are certain men
[11:02] crept in unawares who were before of old
[11:05] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[11:08] men turning the grace of our God into
[11:11] lishness and denying the only Lord God
[11:14] and our Lord Jesus Christ amen the Lord
[11:17] have blessings to the reading of his
[11:18] word you may be seated thank you amen
[11:21] praise the
[11:25] Lord so like I was saying amen there's
[11:27] some there's a difference between faith
[11:29] and
[11:30] trust and the example I was going to use
[11:33] was they were they were celebrating this
[11:35] one man who could ride a bike and they
[11:38] had so much of faith in this man that he
[11:40] could pass through a one side of the
[11:43] mountain to the other side of the
[11:44] mountain and he could ride on a narrow
[11:46] Plank and everyone applauded it and
[11:50] every time he would do it it' become
[11:51] more dangerous look more dangerous and
[11:54] everyone had faith in this man to say
[11:55] you can do
[11:57] it but then he sto one time and he said
[12:00] get on the
[12:02] bike and nobody would get on the bike so
[12:06] they have faith in the man but they
[12:07] didn't trust the
[12:10] man amen so we can't take control of
[12:14] situations in our life by having faith
[12:16] in
[12:17] Jesus but we want to take control of the
[12:19] situation because we don't trust Jesus
[12:21] to handle the
[12:22] situation amen so we've got to take it
[12:25] to another level and Trust Jesus
[12:27] completely amen praise the Lord now
[12:29] Hallelujah maybe I'll just title it
[12:31] Authority versus your identity or our
[12:34] true identity amen our Authority is
[12:36] released in our identity maybe that's
[12:39] what I want to say our true Authority is
[12:42] released in our identity amen so it's
[12:45] identity first then Authority released
[12:49] yes now we are Sons and Daughters of God
[12:52] that puts us in a special class of
[12:54] people and it gives us a special
[12:56] Authority because our father is King of
[12:58] the Earth
[12:59] he's not only King of the earth he's
[13:01] King of the heavens and the
[13:02] Earth amen so we find in Ephesians
[13:05] chapter 1 the prophet is teaching us at
[13:07] Ephesians parallels Joshua and in the
[13:10] very first chapter Ephesians chapter 1:3
[13:13] you'll see the Apostle Paul trying to
[13:15] establish our identity first yes and the
[13:19] authority to take Satan's kingdom down
[13:22] comes in chapter 6
[13:23] later so Authority is our identity is
[13:26] released here blessed be the god God and
[13:29] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had
[13:31] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[13:33] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[13:36] we go through to verse amen continue
[13:38] reading to verse 5 there according as he
[13:41] had chosen Us in him before the
[13:43] foundation of the world what is he
[13:44] showing us now our identity our Origins
[13:47] our
[13:49] beginning that we should be holy and
[13:52] Without Blame before him in love there's
[13:55] your charity there that we should be
[14:00] amen holy Without Blame before him in
[14:04] faith we should be holy Without Blame
[14:07] before him in hope love but in
[14:10] love amen we know 1 Corinthians 13:13
[14:14] now remains faith hope and charity and
[14:15] the greatest of this is love this is the
[14:18] verse we want to get toight in verse 5
[14:20] having predestinated us unto the
[14:22] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[14:25] himself according to the good pleasure
[14:27] of his will so God's true purpose for us
[14:30] on the earth predestined means showing
[14:32] us the end of our destiny destination
[14:35] amen what we are going to end up we are
[14:38] ending up as adopted Sons and Daughters
[14:40] of God so collectively we are all the
[14:42] Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[14:44] individually we are Sons and Daughters
[14:46] of the most high God so God is releasing
[14:49] to us our identity first and with that
[14:52] is going to come the authority amen the
[14:55] the the book of Juda is telling us men
[14:57] have crept in unawares because people
[14:59] have now losing their
[15:01] identity right that is called identity
[15:05] crisis amen when somebody doesn't know
[15:08] their identity now we find this is a
[15:10] pattern there's something powerful about
[15:12] knowing who we are as Sons and Daughters
[15:14] of God because it reconnects us back
[15:16] with God's original purpose and design
[15:19] and his Plan of Redemption amen we know
[15:21] that sin came in and it uh amen it
[15:24] opened up the way now for God to release
[15:26] his attributes but when we see what God
[15:28] is made us in Christ now in the end time
[15:31] the prophet tells us that perfect faith
[15:33] is knowing who we
[15:36] are thank you Lord that releases of
[15:38] Faith to the individual when we know who
[15:40] we are amen so we can type this very
[15:43] quickly in the first Exodus the angel of
[15:46] the Lord comes to Moses in the burning
[15:48] bush establishing his identity as the
[15:50] deliverer of the children of Israel he
[15:53] gives him his identity first yes amen
[15:57] then he reveals to him his purpose and
[15:59] now he's going to him and then he sends
[16:01] him out with the authority amen amen we
[16:04] are going to find this pattern in all
[16:06] three Exodus praise the Lord amen and
[16:10] after after the how I'm going to say
[16:13] this after the prophet messenger comes
[16:15] there's always Joshua follows it
[16:20] amen amen wonderful there's always
[16:23] someone going into the
[16:24] land taking back what the messenger came
[16:28] to pave the way for
[16:30] amen Moses did it he led them to a
[16:32] certain point but God now comes in
[16:34] Joshua chapter 1 and he reveals Joshua's
[16:37] identity as you are going to be the one
[16:39] that's going to cross over into the
[16:41] promised land so there's always a
[16:44] followup Ministry to the prophet
[16:46] messenger yes amen amen we find this
[16:48] also in the second Exodus the voice of
[16:51] the Jordan of forun crying Behold the
[16:53] Lamb of God who takes away the sins of
[16:55] the world but was that revealing Jesus
[16:58] true identity in part the true identity
[17:01] comes when the voice speaks from Heaven
[17:03] this is my beloved Son hallelujah amen
[17:07] revealing Jesus
[17:09] identity amen so when his identity is
[17:12] revealed it releases Authority within
[17:15] him because now he goes he's full of the
[17:17] Holy Ghost and he goes to be tested in
[17:19] the desert and he releases his authority
[17:22] and his authority is based on the word
[17:24] and he says it is
[17:26] written there can be no greater
[17:28] Authority than to base it on the
[17:30] word so you can see the pattern there
[17:32] again identity of Jesus revealed first
[17:34] then his authority is Unleashed amen
[17:38] amen praise the Lord then what follows
[17:41] Jesus ministry is the Greater Works and
[17:43] these shall he do yes on the day of
[17:45] Pentecost the Holy Ghost comes a type of
[17:47] Joshua Ministry and a people go into the
[17:49] land of the Holy Ghost people come back
[17:52] into the position you are seeing that
[17:54] the Peter and John man they standing at
[17:56] the gate beautiful able to command a man
[17:58] sced from birth amen and amen command
[18:01] him that his body be
[18:03] healed yes hallelujah hallelujah thank
[18:06] you
[18:08] amen praise the Lord you know that was
[18:10] Sunday's message Peter and John amen
[18:13] type of every True Believer faith and
[18:16] love amen sandwich in between is all
[18:18] other Seven Virtues but you're seeing
[18:20] the foundation and you're seeing the
[18:22] Capstone together amen that's a powerful
[18:24] man that's a man going in the Rapture
[18:26] that's a man walking in Authority that
[18:28] can go to a person and say stop looking
[18:30] around look on us deity is in me now
[18:34] Look on
[18:36] us there's some there's a bonus comes
[18:38] upon the believer when you recognize who
[18:40] you are you're a Son of God Satan can't
[18:44] mess with you amen you need to give him
[18:46] legal notice and kick him out of our
[18:48] Lives you have no legal Authority in my
[18:50] life you have no legal Authority in my
[18:52] family I'm a Son of
[18:54] God Amen so the Holy Ghost we know gives
[18:57] rest amen so there's a people who come
[18:59] to their rest after Jesus the son of man
[19:03] Ministry wonderful then we find now in
[19:05] the Third Exodus the angel of the Lord
[19:07] comes to brother Bram in a cave and he
[19:09] reveals to him his strange and
[19:11] misunderstood life what is he doing he's
[19:13] going to reveal his identity to
[19:15] him yes sir praise the Lord it gives him
[19:19] his identity and his purpose of what he
[19:21] is to do to take a message to the
[19:23] nations of the world and he's going to
[19:25] have two signs that's right Hallelujah
[19:28] amen one amen the sign in the hand the
[19:31] second amen he's going to be able to
[19:33] discern the secrets of the heart and
[19:35] then he tells him if you get the people
[19:37] to believe you are release such an
[19:39] authority upon your life that not even
[19:41] cancel will be able to stand in your way
[19:44] amen you know that's not out of
[19:45] scripture because even Peter's Shadow
[19:48] was healing people every essence about
[19:50] you because you're a Son of God ought to
[19:52] be full of authority full of power
[19:56] amen amen your presence in the work
[19:58] place at school at amen at University
[20:01] wherever you're going amen at home
[20:03] carries an anointing even your
[20:06] Shadow amen now remember you've got to
[20:09] believe that about yourself when you
[20:11] realize your identity it releases your
[20:14] Authority don't tell me that Peter had a
[20:16] crisis of his identity yes if he had a
[20:19] crisis of identity his shadow wouldn't
[20:21] have healed an
[20:23] ant but the Bible says they laid people
[20:25] in the streets perhaps that Peter Shadow
[20:28] would pass over them and the anointing
[20:30] that would be there would heal them I
[20:32] tell you your anointing doesn't leave
[20:34] you when you leave this earth they took
[20:36] a dead man once the soldiers somebody
[20:38] died amen and they threw them in the
[20:40] cave of Elisha amen that man came back
[20:42] to life amen hallelujah hallelujah amen
[20:47] oh we talk about a Superman you're a
[20:49] super son and daughter of God you carry
[20:52] an anointing when brother Brandon is
[20:53] talking about a super church and a super
[20:55] race he knows what he is talking about
[20:57] every f your being carries an anointing
[21:01] carries an
[21:03] authority can you imagine even you gone
[21:05] into the sixth Dimension your remains
[21:07] that remains here on the Earth all go
[21:09] back to the Earth all 16 elements but it
[21:12] still carries an
[21:14] anointing thank you Lord because you
[21:17] don't lose your anointing you don't lose
[21:18] your position you remember
[21:21] Samuel you are still a prophet yes sir
[21:25] amen so when God positions you he really
[21:27] positions you God doesn't give you a
[21:29] position today to demote you tomorrow
[21:32] but God is looking for increase in our
[21:33] lives God is looking for us to enlarge
[21:35] our borders in our
[21:37] territories that's why God honored JB's
[21:40] Faith he looked at this man with vision
[21:41] and he said I like this man he's not
[21:43] satisfied with the land that Joshua
[21:45] allocated to him and he's praying to me
[21:47] to enlarge my
[21:50] borders amen God likes a man with
[21:53] visions that expands amen that just we
[21:55] some a big God he said asking for big
[21:57] things
[21:59] amen amen Lord if you can just give me
[22:02] this little bit no he says asking for
[22:04] big things don't limit yourself amen ask
[22:07] him for big things because when he gives
[22:09] he gives exceeding abundantly above all
[22:12] that we can never ask for
[22:14] thing amen when when God gives he says
[22:17] he gives pressed down shaken together
[22:19] and running over God is not limited in
[22:22] his giving amen we may be limited in our
[22:25] giving when it comes to our offerings
[22:28] when it comes to our tide when it comes
[22:29] to our charity and giving to other
[22:31] people we may be
[22:32] thinking uh second thoughts about what
[22:37] we're going to do but God doesn't give
[22:39] that way right have you ever been in a
[22:42] position where money is not
[22:45] immaterial maybe you've experienced some
[22:47] form of it right at one stage you were
[22:49] struggling you couldn't even afford to
[22:50] buy bread but maybe God has blessed you
[22:53] in life now you can walk into a shop and
[22:55] you can buy 10 loaves of
[22:57] bread amen
[23:00] yeah so that's how we are in God's
[23:02] Kingdom right we have untapped resources
[23:05] and we have an unlimited potential but
[23:07] we we go and we shop sparingly yes do
[23:11] you know that sometimes you can have a
[23:13] mindset that because you grow up a
[23:15] certain way that even when money is
[23:17] released to you you can't spend it right
[23:20] that's right amen because your your
[23:24] purchasing power is based on an old
[23:26] mentality
[23:28] but now that the the the mighty Angel
[23:30] has come down he's released a new buying
[23:32] potential to
[23:34] us amen he says that all that the Father
[23:37] in Heaven has is given to you that title
[23:40] de means it's your Authority he's
[23:41] releasing an authority to the
[23:43] church amen so when brother brandham
[23:46] comes now is a messenger of the age
[23:48] revealing his identity what he's going
[23:50] to do he's going to turn the hearts of
[23:52] the children back to the faith of the
[23:53] fathers that's the first part of his
[23:55] ministry amen and he's going to also
[23:58] amen reveal the
[24:00] Mysteries the mystery of God you know
[24:02] that's Revelation 10:7 yes Hallelujah
[24:06] but following him now we showed you how
[24:08] every Ministry there had a
[24:11] followup there was a Joshua to a Moses

[24:34] say Lord increase it Lord Jesus I want
[24:36] to operate in the Overflow amen I don't
[24:38] want to operate sparingly as I'm
[24:40] drinking it's going down down down

[24:44] that's how the Bride of the end time
[24:46] operates the wise virgin was not taking
[24:49] from The
[24:50] Vessel the oil in the lamp didn't run
[24:53] dry amen there was an overflow a
[24:55] continual flow of the spirit of God that
[24:58] she didn't even touch the Overflow as
[25:00] yet that's the level of anointing we
[25:03] want to operate in hallelujah amen
[25:05] hallelujah that's the level we ought to
[25:06] be increasing right now say Lord help me
[25:09] to ascend the realm of the heavenlies
[25:10] Lord Jesus help me to push the
[25:12] boundaries Lord Jesus I'm not satisfied
[25:14] in my all to be condition I want to move
[25:17] forward oh God Amen if we can have some
[25:20] Joshua here today amen if we can have
[25:22] some calebs here positioning amen and
[25:25] moving with Joshua the Holy Ghost amen
[25:27] we can advance kingdom of
[25:29] God hallelujah sir so what we are saying
[25:33] there's got to be a people filled with
[25:34] the Holy Ghost to follow the ministry of
[25:36] brother
[25:37] Brandon who connects with the same Angel
[25:40] that's right amen hallelujah it's an
[25:42] all-encompassing Cloud that was over the
[25:45] angel Mighty Angel he was clothed with a
[25:48] cloud have you ever seen a cloud in the
[25:50] heavens it clothes the evens right takes
[25:54] an expense so if you going to take the
[25:57] book from the angel you must come in
[26:00] contact with that cloud yes sir you've
[26:02] got to go into the vicinity of the cloud
[26:04] you've got to enter the cloud amen we've
[26:07] got to realize what we are we are in
[26:10] association with the Angelic world is
[26:12] what I'm trying to tell you amen the
[26:14] Angelic world Amen is here to connect
[26:16] with your faith because all of
[26:19] redemption plan is now locked up in you
[26:21] the fullness of what's going to happen
[26:23] at the end time is locked up in you God
[26:25] has positioned Us in this time and
[26:27] purpose to finish the race and now
[26:30] there's a cloud of many witnesses as we
[26:32] got the Baton and we are running the
[26:34] race with patience they are cheering us
[26:36] on saying you are just there at the
[26:38] Finish Line keep pushing forward keep
[26:40] moving forward you know why they
[26:42] cheering us on us finishing the race
[26:45] means that they come out of the
[26:48] graves amen so they are cheering for us
[26:50] finish the race finish the race so we
[26:52] can come back to the
[26:55] Earth amen amen amen praise the Lord
[26:58] Lord so we must have faith and trust in
[27:00] Jesus amen there's a difference between
[27:02] now contending for the faith and resting
[27:04] in faith but both are important we got
[27:07] to know when to rest and when to contend
[27:10] praise the Lord amen so we know to
[27:12] condemn means to strive for contest amen
[27:14] against difficulties amen the word means
[27:17] there to be strenuous or make a labored
[27:19] effort it means to fight to wrestle to
[27:22] content for the faith amen amen I say we
[27:25] content for the faith amen that was once
[27:28] deliver to
[27:29] brandom demon powers have been trying to
[27:31] strip the message down demon powers have
[27:34] come against an attack in the message do
[27:36] you know the message of the hour is the
[27:37] kingdom of God that's why the strongest
[27:39] attack is coming against the message of
[27:41] the hour and Jesus said the Kingdom of
[27:44] Heaven suffered violence and the
[27:45] violence take it by
[27:47] force amen amen hallelujah verse four is
[27:51] telling us false teachers have crept
[27:53] into the Christian Community crept into
[27:55] message churches perverting the grace of
[27:57] God denying The Authority that Jesus put
[28:00] into the
[28:01] church people are now want to say no The
[28:04] Authority only resu with the
[28:06] gr when he says we have become the final
[28:08] voice to the final age amen you know
[28:11] what it is weak faith not enough Faith
[28:13] they don't they in identity crisis they
[28:15] don't know who they are when you reject
[28:18] the cloud you're rejecting your
[28:20] identity praise the Lord because the
[28:22] prophet says that was our Lord up there
[28:26] Hallelujah to reject the Lord up there
[28:28] to reject your identity is to reject
[28:30] your
[28:31] genes your
[28:33] genealogy praise the Lord amen
[28:35] hallelujah amen so when Jesus is saying
[28:38] the kingdom you can put it up Matthew
[28:39] 11:12 if somebody's writing it down amen
[28:42] the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence
[28:44] amen amen and the violence take it by
[28:48] force some of us need to operate like
[28:51] that Satan is coming all out in in an
[28:53] onslaught against us all the fiery DTS
[28:56] of Hell appointed against us amen
[28:58] Onslaught Onslaught after Onslaught
[29:00] coming against us but we've got to fight
[29:03] back you know you get some children in
[29:05] school where the bully just bullies them
[29:07] and they take every punch they
[29:09] get until it comes a time amen when they
[29:12] say enough is
[29:13] enough today I'm going to put up my fist
[29:16] and I'm going to push back I'm going to
[29:18] fight back and when he push back against
[29:21] a bully he's not expecting that amen and
[29:23] he runs
[29:25] away amen the prophet of God says when
[29:28] you finally see the devil and you see
[29:29] what a little puny fellow he was and you
[29:32] wonder how this fellow deceived the
[29:33] nations of the
[29:35] earth sir praise the Lord so I I want to
[29:39] say this that the violent
[29:41] Onslaught on the
[29:44] enemy the violence of your
[29:48] faith
[29:49] amen is to establish your Authority in
[29:52] Christ amen when you are going against
[29:55] the enemy what are you exercising you
[29:58] Authority yes it's to exercise your
[30:00] Authority so when God is asking you to
[30:02] contend for the faith and exercise the
[30:05] violence of your faith against the enemy
[30:07] and unleash wrath upon the enemy because
[30:09] your faith causes wrath and Devastation
[30:12] upon the Satan's kingdom do you know
[30:14] them demons go running they go into a
[30:16] scramble they don't know how to operate
[30:18] when you operate in faith hallah amen
[30:21] demons are powerful when you operate by
[30:23] fear
[30:25] yes but when a man and a daughter of God
[30:28] Rises up in faith Satan Kingdom go into
[30:30] a panic and they scatter yes they
[30:32] couldn't stand the presence of Jesus and
[30:34] they even wanted to go into pigs I tell
[30:37] you if you can only see the the
[30:39] spiritual world when you walk by when
[30:40] you are coming by because you are
[30:42] carrying the light of God in this age
[30:45] and you see how demons start to scatter
[30:47] you see how people start to stutter you
[30:49] see how people start to scramble they
[30:51] don't want you in their presence because
[30:54] you carry an anointing and an authority
[30:55] of God Amen Hallelujah maybe you've
[30:58] experienced it more in the religious
[31:00] realm because you know how this
[31:01] religious demons they operate they don't
[31:03] want you to speak about the word of God
[31:05] most especially the religious Christian
[31:07] demons that's
[31:09] right no but our pastor see this
[31:13] way according to the tradition of our
[31:16] church we've always seen it this way
[31:19] amen but we want God's way to be our way
[31:22] that's the only way we
[31:24] want amen so God when he's telling us
[31:28] take it by
[31:29] force exercise violence upon the
[31:33] enemy he is releasing to us our
[31:36] Authority and revealing to us our
[31:38] Authority amen so some promises we have
[31:41] to fight for and some promises he wants
[31:44] us to be still and let us let it know
[31:47] amen let us know that he is God Amen
[31:51] praise the Lord some promises he wants
[31:53] us to be still and receive it by faith
[31:55] Hallelujah he's wanting when he's that
[31:58] when he's telling us be still and know
[32:00] that I am God that's a time he's now
[32:03] wanting us to know our identity because
[32:06] this is not of your own works this is by
[32:09] Grace there were certain works that
[32:11] Abraham could
[32:13] do but him having a child he couldn't do
[32:17] that was beyond him am God had to
[32:19] release that Grace to him for the
[32:21] changing of the body so what am I saying
[32:24] there are some things we can do in the
[32:26] Christian faith to advance the kingdom M
[32:28] but the body change we can't
[32:31] do because the Lord himself shall
[32:33] descend from heaven with a
[32:35] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[32:38] and with the Trump of God Amen praise
[32:41] the Lord
[32:42] hallelujah so there are some things we
[32:44] are receiving by faith there are
[32:46] something we're advancing by faith amen
[32:48] praise the Lord amen remember I'm saying
[32:51] it again because I want you to
[32:52] understand this even the young people
[32:54] when you advancing the kingdom of God
[32:56] and tearing down Satan's kingdom you you
[32:57] are releasing your
[32:59] Authority when you are still and know
[33:01] that he is God he's revealing your
[33:03] identity you are my son you just rest
[33:06] I'm going to do this for you you go into
[33:09] the IE will
[33:10] Covenant praise the Lord so until we
[33:13] discover who we are and come into the
[33:14] place of rest of our identity nothing
[33:17] will be released to us we just showed
[33:19] you through three Exodus your identity
[33:21] first then the authority if there's no
[33:23] Authority released in your life first
[33:25] check your identity do you really know
[33:27] who you are in Christ
[33:30] amen so faith can be operated as a
[33:33] principle because faith is a law or
[33:35] faith can be operated by relationship
[33:38] amen when you have relationship with
[33:40] your father amen that's right
[33:45] amen we can't Advance the kingdom of God
[33:48] applying just Concepts and theories yes
[33:50] amen we can replace that with a walk
[33:53] with Christ amen
[33:55] yes a relationship with Jesus Christ
[33:58] that is what God wants us to do to rest
[33:59] in him to to let go of our burdens and
[34:03] let him carry them some some burdens in
[34:05] life are too much for us some we can't
[34:07] handle and some that's why Jesus says
[34:09] cast all your cares upon me for he carth
[34:11] for you amen Jesus says take my
[34:15] yoke my yoke is easy and my burden is
[34:18] light yes I ask you stop trying release
[34:22] now release that burden release that
[34:25] arake release that pressure release that
[34:28] circumstance amen release that worry I
[34:30] know some people oh you know you can't
[34:33] operate sometimes we think we got faith
[34:35] but in that heart you know there's worry
[34:36] there you know there's doubt there you
[34:39] know there's fear there now you're
[34:41] trying to operate in faith and that's an
[34:43] hindrance to Faith and you can't see the
[34:45] miracle advancing because as long as you
[34:48] got that that worry there as long as you
[34:49] got that depression there as long as you
[34:51] got the thought in your heart there
[34:53] Faith can't operate am so you've got to
[34:57] leave it there
[34:58] Hallelujah leave it there take your
[35:01] burdens to the Lord and leave it there
[35:03] the Lord if you trust and never doubt he
[35:06] will surely bring you out take your
[35:09] burdens to the Lord and leave it there
[35:11] let's sing it leave it
[35:13] there leave it there take your burdens
[35:18] to the Lord and leave it
[35:20] there if we trust and never doubt he
[35:24] will surely bring you out take your bir
[35:28] to the Lord and leave it there now when
[35:31] we rest that is showing that we trust
[35:34] Jesus
[35:35] Hallelujah to rest without worry is
[35:37] showing that we trust Jesus
[35:40] yes amen rest equals peace when we are
[35:44] resting we're showing we
[35:46] Shalom rest means that we are quietening
[35:49] our racing thoughts and our worries and
[35:51] our concerns and turning them over to
[35:53] God amen amen Jesus said in John 10:10
[35:57] now what watch when Jesus gives I was
[35:58] telling you John 10:10 I came that you
[36:01] may have
[36:03] life what kind of Life Jesus and have it
[36:10] abundantly amen he come to give us life
[36:14] look what the thief comes to do steal
[36:16] kill
[36:18] destroy I have come that they may have
[36:21] life and they may have it more
[36:23] abundantly amen amen thank you we can
[36:27] give
[36:28] Jesus the more we give the more he
[36:30] lavishes his love on us well he brought
[36:33] me to his banqueting table His Banner
[36:37] Over Me Is
[36:39] Love he brought me to his banquetting
[36:43] table His Banner Over Me Is Love
[36:47] Hallelujah we can't out give Jesus the
[36:50] more we give the more He blesses us the
[36:52] more we give the more He blesses
[36:55] us amen hallelujah amen
[36:59] amen thank you Lord not only did Jesus
[37:02] promise to save us from our sins and
[37:04] save us he says we can't be effective if
[37:08] we are carrying guilt he came to release
[37:10] us from guilt also you can't live life
[37:13] with the guilt of the past that's right
[37:15] you know what something about the blood
[37:17] of Jesus when he cleanses he makes you
[37:19] as white as snow it says say you've
[37:22] never done it in the first place your
[37:25] past is Forgiven your past is erased
[37:27] amen Jesus doesn't remember it anymore
[37:29] all is asking confess it am release it
[37:32] to me
[37:34] amen you know his strength is made
[37:36] perfect in our weakness so whatever that
[37:38] weak area in your life is God can
[37:40] strengthen it

[38:18] the headed of the others he said no does
[38:20] he eat different no does he sleep do no
