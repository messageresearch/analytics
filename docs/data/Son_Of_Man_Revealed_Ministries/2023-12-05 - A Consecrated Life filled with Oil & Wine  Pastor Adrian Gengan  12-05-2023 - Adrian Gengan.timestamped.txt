[3:04] [Music]
[3:05] will ask in Jesus name amen amen
[3:09] amen ritual in the precious name of our
[3:12] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[3:17] I'm actually surprised
[3:19] amen
[3:22] and I think we can give the Lord a good
[3:24] hand clip of praise
[3:29] because he was doing a good work in US
[3:32] amen he's able to finish it Hallelujah
[3:35] amen and I believe amen you have come
[3:38] with that expectation in our hearts when
[3:40] we initially thought of this we said you
[3:42] know it was just a desire we had and
[3:44] then the prophet confirmed it with that
[3:46] message we were listening to speak to
[3:47] the mountain
[3:48] and then we we thought okay let's just
[3:50] leave it to anyone wants to come it's
[3:53] not a compulsory service
[3:54] but amen I can see the Zeal in your
[3:57] heart
[3:57] amen and the Lord is pleased with you
[3:59] amen so we are now in the second watch
[4:03] [Music]
[4:05] amen you know the first watch starts at
[4:07] six six to nine second watch is nine two
[4:10] twelve
[4:13] so we're approaching the Third Watch
[4:15] amen and at midnight if you do a study
[4:18] on midnight you know things Shake prison
[4:21] shake when the Praises go up at midnight
[4:31] Third Watch
[4:34] starts the Third Watch
[4:36] amen hallelujah so we're moving from the
[4:39] second to the third you get what I mean
[4:41] amen
[4:44] so the third call has been open to us
[4:47] the major part the opening of the word
[4:49] yeah
[4:51] amen but we are Desiring another part of
[4:54] their third pool to be opened up unto us
[4:56] yes amen so this evening for a little
[4:58] thought amen you know no service is
[5:00] complete without the reading of the word
[5:01] so have a little excitation amen so this
[5:04] is our 23 hour service we're approaching
[5:07] the 23rd hour amen so it consecrated a
[5:09] life filled with oil and wine
[5:12] amen
[5:13] filled with oil and wine
[5:16] amen hallelujah you know anytime there's
[5:18] a consecration oil is required amen amen
[5:22] wine is required amen so we'll take our
[5:24] reading amen from The Book of Romans
[5:28] chapter 12 verse 1 and 2. it says I
[5:30] beseech thee therefore Brethren by the
[5:33] mercies of God that you present your
[5:35] bodies a Living Sacrifice
[5:37] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[5:41] reasonable service
[5:43] and be not conformed to this world
[5:46] see the scripture is talking about
[5:47] consecration but be transformed by the
[5:51] renewing of your mind amen that you may
[5:54] prove what is
[5:55] what is that good and acceptable and
[5:59] perfect will of God you see we've got a
[6:01] part to prove
[6:03] brother Brandon would go on and say that
[6:05] this bride is going to prove to Satan
[6:07] that she's not like the first Eve amen
[6:09] and she will not fall like the first Eve
[6:12] so we got a part to prove amen may the
[6:14] Lord that blessing to the reading of his
[6:15] word you may be seated
[6:17] so we don't know how the service will go
[6:19] amen we just go as the Lord leads amen
[6:22] hallelujah amen
[6:25] so you know when we talk about
[6:27] consecration most people will not want
[6:29] to be a part of it but I'm glad to see
[6:32] majority of the church here and that we
[6:35] have a Zeal to be consecrated now
[6:36] consecrated means to be set apart
[6:39] amen and
[6:41] to be consecrated in fact consecration
[6:44] is actually the foundation
[6:46] of a Christian walk amen
[6:49] amen
[6:49] when you are building
[6:52] and your foundation is not built
[6:54] properly yeah
[6:55] yeah amen you can't come now to the roof
[6:58] path and then try and fix the foundation
[7:01] you're going to have problems with your
[7:03] building
[7:04] so consecration is very important in the
[7:06] Christian Life in the Christian walk
[7:08] amen amen hallelujah
[7:12] but we want to consecrate ourselves
[7:14] every step of the way and especially now
[7:16] in leadership in the darkest age amen we
[7:20] ought to be consecrating ourselves daily
[7:22] amen the prophet says that we backslide
[7:25] daily yes
[7:26] amen so we are to consecrate ourselves
[7:29] daily
[7:30] to be set apart Amen to love and live
[7:33] for God now consecrate also means to
[7:35] make holy or dedicate to a higher
[7:38] purpose
[7:39] to surrender everything die to self amen
[7:42] amen hallelujah so a Believer will
[7:46] consecrates himself amen gives his time
[7:49] give his own plans to God gives his
[7:51] position he gives himself he gives his
[7:54] all in consecration
[7:55] amen because living a consecrated life
[7:58] brings Joy amen peace the Bible says I
[8:03] will keep you in perfect peace whose
[8:05] mind is stayed on me amen amen so we
[8:08] find the benefits of living a
[8:10] consecrated life are inexhaustible
[8:12] because he is the inexhaustible function
[8:14] of life
[8:15] and this is the reason one must dedicate
[8:17] their lives to God in order to enjoy the
[8:20] benefits
[8:21] amen amen now I don't believe you stayed
[8:24] awake this late in the night
[8:26] amen
[8:29] if you didn't have a Zeal to turn your
[8:32] life around
[8:34] amen
[8:35] you know in in our homes as well if
[8:38] things are just the same there comes a
[8:40] point in time where we want to renovate
[8:42] we want to change things up
[8:45] amen and if we can do that in the
[8:47] natural they even have something called
[8:49] Every Spring people want to do spring
[8:51] cleaning
[8:52] but in the natural if we can do these
[8:54] things how about we shake things up in
[8:56] our lives how about we don't just go
[8:58] continuing the same old way
[9:01] amen and we haven't gathered in a
[9:03] convenient hour
[9:05] because we purposed in our hearts if we
[9:07] said Lord we want to prove to you that
[9:09] we are serious and we are desperate for
[9:11] you
[9:13] amen otherwise we could have gathered at
[9:15] seven o'clock
[9:17] amen we could have gathered at the
[9:18] normal hour but yeah the prophet we find
[9:21] amen and these are some of the quotes
[9:23] we've been through I just want to
[9:24] reiterate it he says give me 500 people
[9:27] born of the spirit of God filled with
[9:30] the Holy Ghost and on fire for God Amen
[9:33] can anybody identify that being you amen
[9:36] amen filled with the spirit of God
[9:39] filled with the Holy Ghost and set on
[9:42] fire for God Amen
[9:44] listen to what he says now standing
[9:46] statement he says I'll do more for the
[9:48] kingdom of God in one year's time then
[9:51] the whole church has done in 2000 years
[9:55] amen
[9:57] the prophet just needed 500 people
[10:00] Born Again filled with a spirit on fire
[10:03] for God amen amen and I believe this is
[10:06] the church
[10:07] amen he may not be here physically but
[10:10] we are still under our messenger amen
[10:12] amen and we can do more for the kingdom
[10:15] of God in this year
[10:16] it's already started amen
[10:19] hallelujah amen you know there's going
[10:22] to be a group of people who finish the
[10:23] work yes who finish redemption's plan
[10:26] amen amen God's not going to call on
[10:28] angels to finish the work God is looking
[10:31] to you and me to finish the work
[10:33] amen
[10:35] so he says he goes on to say this group
[10:38] of people will believe in signs and
[10:40] wonders and miracles
[10:42] not make believe
[10:44] you know we got a lot of people walking
[10:45] around make believe yes we believe in
[10:47] signs and wonders yes we believe Amen in
[10:50] uh the sick being healed but you see no
[10:52] manifestation
[10:54] amen so we know don't want to walk
[10:56] around in Make Believe
[10:58] make believe like yes we believe Mark 16
[11:00] but we never ever see the manifestation
[11:03] of it neither do we have the faith to
[11:06] speak it
[11:07] it says but truly born of the spirit of
[11:10] God that's God's program
[11:14] Hallelujah is God's program sitting and
[11:18] studying and and being intellectual is
[11:20] that what he's saying
[11:22] he's bringing it down to a manifestation
[11:25] amen hallelujah he says we just come
[11:28] back to that sincerity of the world if
[11:31] we come back to the sincerity of the
[11:32] word amen he says believe that so God
[11:35] can vindicate himself
[11:37] now he says now what shall you bring
[11:39] sincerity
[11:40] consecration he says that's where
[11:43] sincerity and sacredness five good
[11:45] people
[11:46] we got more than five now
[11:49] I can see we're competing for that spot
[11:51] of five amen but there's room for all
[11:54] but he said I just need five
[11:57] amen but amen I can see there's a
[11:59] competition here now nobody wants to be
[12:01] left behind
[12:03] everybody wants to be the five amen amen
[12:06] really filled with the spirit will do
[12:08] more in Phoenix than all the members we
[12:10] got in the message amen amen if they're
[12:14] consecrated to God in a sincere life
[12:16] amen
[12:18] yeah we don't care about pump and pride
[12:20] yeah we don't care about reputation
[12:22] amongst the community the message
[12:24] Community we want a consecrated life
[12:28] amen we want to Humble consecrated life
[12:31] where the spirit of God can move through
[12:33] us
[12:34] matters not whether we are recognized or
[12:36] not as long as we are recognized by
[12:38] heaven and we are backed by Heaven amen
[12:42] amen he says why now watch these people
[12:45] who are consecrated these five good
[12:47] people in Phoenix now I didn't change
[12:49] that name there
[12:51] I didn't put feelings he's not talking
[12:53] about Jeffersonville he actually says
[12:55] Phoenix
[12:57] we'll do more in Phoenix than all the
[12:59] members we got if they have consecrated
[13:01] a God in his sincere life
[13:03] he says because God will move his word
[13:05] through there
[13:07] through Phoenix
[13:09] to the people in Phoenix
[13:12] and vindicate that to be the truth and
[13:15] the first thing you know things are
[13:16] happening I got good news for you amen
[13:18] things have already started to happen
[13:20] amen amen this is just a continuation of
[13:23] things happening amen
[13:25] amen you can't hold him down you can't
[13:27] hold it down amen amen hallelujah now
[13:31] this consecrated life really requires
[13:33] oil and wine
[13:35] amen we come here and we see in
[13:37] Revelation 6 6 under the third seal
[13:41] it says see the hook not the oil and
[13:44] wine yes
[13:46] these two things are very important for
[13:48] a consecrated life
[13:50] amen amen if you had to look back you'll
[13:53] see the priesthood was set aside for a
[13:55] consecrated life they couldn't mingle
[13:58] with the rest of the people they had to
[14:00] be set apart amen
[14:02] amen amen but they had to be Anointed
[14:04] with the oil yes yes amen amen the
[14:07] garments had to be anointed you can read
[14:09] all about it in Exodus 20s 9 30 amen
[14:12] going into Leviticus and showing you how
[14:15] Aaron and his sons the priesthood had to
[14:17] be consecrated later on the same concept
[14:20] was taken to Kings and God anointed
[14:23] Kings
[14:24] how did he do it with the oil amen amen
[14:28] and we know yet is a picture of oil and
[14:32] wine amen we get oil from olives
[14:38] that's your olive plant there amen and
[14:41] you're getting wine from grapes
[14:45] Hallelujah and the spirit was speaking
[14:47] to us and telling us don't just be
[14:49] satisfied with grape juice
[14:53] let it ferment a bit amen
[14:56] amen
[14:57] because many people can drink grape
[14:59] juice and never get filled with the
[15:01] spirit never get stimulated
[15:03] but a wine that's fermented begins to
[15:05] stimulate you amen amen
[15:08] and you know there's something about
[15:10] this too that they are grown together
[15:14] these two plants are grown together
[15:16] amen when I started to look at it these
[15:19] two are very similar
[15:21] types of plants they grow in the same
[15:24] kind of climate
[15:25] amen and both of them require a certain
[15:30] amount
[15:31] of squeezing and pressing to get the
[15:34] nutrients out
[15:35] both go under the same process in order
[15:38] to get out that juice you got to squeeze
[15:40] it in order to get out that oil you got
[15:43] to squeeze it amen amen and God is
[15:46] squeezing us now amen getting out that
[15:49] oil under wine
[15:52] amen so wine and oil share similar
[15:55] similar traits amen because the Olive
[15:57] and the grapes are harvested crushed
[16:00] bottled and tested for Purity and
[16:02] quality
[16:04] now there's something about this
[16:06] why they grow these two trees together
[16:08] you see the Grapevine
[16:11] is the shorter ones there
[16:14] right and the olive trees are found
[16:16] growing together in The Vineyards both
[16:19] require a similar climate and the olive
[16:22] trees
[16:23] act as protection
[16:28] for the vines
[16:30] so they grow it like that you can see
[16:32] the Olive Tree is there forming
[16:34] protection for the vines
[16:37] amen amen now we know the natural types
[16:40] the spiritual
[16:42] amen
[16:42] hallelujah so what is it doing
[16:46] no I didn't write this right I copied it
[16:48] and I pasted it here this is a journal
[16:51] from farming and they are telling you
[16:53] that
[16:56] the olive trees act as protection for
[16:58] the grapevines
[17:00] shielding them against strong winds
[17:03] wins or Wars and stripes
[17:06] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[17:09] but we're in a daily walk
[17:10] and you know the oil represents the Holy
[17:13] Spirit
[17:14] the oil is good and what does wine
[17:16] represent
[17:18] amen the stimulation of Revelation
[17:20] the Holy Ghost is protecting our
[17:23] Revelation in this time amen while
[17:26] millions are being deceived we will not
[17:28] be deceived because God has opened up
[17:29] our Revelation amen amen so watch The
[17:33] Olive Tree the the oil
[17:35] is protecting our Revelation in this
[17:38] time shielding us from winds from what
[17:42] in Strife amen amen hold back the winds
[17:47] amen hallelujah amen amen and you know
[17:50] what these two trees are they are
[17:52] self-pollinators
[17:56] amen because now look at how they type
[18:00] it but I'm going into a spiritual
[18:01] meaning neither rely on the help of
[18:03] insects
[18:05] Birds to pollinate their flowers no
[18:07] outside interference amen everything he
[18:10] comes from the inside
[18:12] amen we don't need these insects
[18:18] [Music]
[18:21] we are self-pollinating amen amen
[18:26] Hallelujah now one of the biggest
[18:28] differences between the two the olive
[18:30] oil
[18:32] the grape is that oil
[18:36] does not improve with age so oil is
[18:39] going to be put to use
[18:42] amen
[18:43] amen but wine gets better with age now
[18:47] follow their thought now because your
[18:50] Revelation when you first came in the
[18:51] message got better with age
[18:54] amen Ash Who let that wine ferment
[18:58] within you isn't your Revelation
[18:59] increasing in Christ amen because wine
[19:02] gets better with age
[19:04] but you better not store the oil you
[19:06] better put the oil to use amen yes
[19:09] you know what happens to olive oil if
[19:11] you keep it and you don't use it
[19:13] you have to throw it away
[19:16] amen so the Holy Spirit has got to be
[19:18] put to use amen amen
[19:21] amen hallelujah amen I'll try not to be
[19:24] too long I just want to hit these
[19:25] highlights amen the prophet now opening
[19:28] up this mystery in the third seal so oil
[19:30] and wine I just I took it out of a quote
[19:33] form and I put it into this form right
[19:35] this is all these quotes
[19:37] exact words he says oil and wine is
[19:39] associated together in the Bible
[19:42] oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit then he
[19:45] gives us two scriptures where Aaron
[19:47] before he went in there to be Anointed
[19:49] with oil
[19:51] amen now you say why am I talking to you
[19:53] about oil sorry about Aaron I'm not a
[19:57] priest yes you are
[20:00] that old priesthood was taken away
[20:03] there's a new priesthood here Christ is
[20:05] our high priest but he's got other
[20:08] priests on the Earth
[20:09] amen
[20:11] and we have to be Anointed with oil
[20:14] so he says oil is the holy spirit we
[20:17] have to be Anointed with the Holy Spirit
[20:18] and then he goes in Zechariah 4 12 oil
[20:22] coming out pouring through those two
[20:24] pipes and he says this is my spirit oil
[20:27] and then he gives us the third scripture
[20:29] Matthew 25 4 the wise virgin has oil in
[20:33] her lamp because she is Spirit-filled
[20:36] amen so I'm just hitting the highlights
[20:38] of what he says there and wine he says
[20:40] symbolizes stimulation of Revelation
[20:43] he goes on to say what is wine in the
[20:45] Bible refreshments
[20:47] amen the is the refreshment that comes
[20:50] from the presence of the Lord amen amen
[20:53] if you are struggling with something in
[20:55] your life maybe you're struggling amen
[20:57] with overcoming amen the flesh amen ask
[21:00] the Lord to come and give you the
[21:01] baptism of the holy spirit amen amen
[21:04] amen hallelujah say Lord you can cleanse
[21:07] me father from this whole life of sin
[21:09] amen the only thing that was given to
[21:12] man to prosper in this life was the New
[21:14] Birth outside of that we are going to
[21:17] fail so say Lord oh give me that new
[21:20] birth amen
[21:22] Hallelujah give me yeah you know what
[21:24] the new birth consists of justification
[21:27] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:30] amen
[21:31] labor amen cry out to god father change
[21:34] my life
[21:36] amen and as you begin to read his word
[21:38] he opens up his Revelation to you it

[25:40] some of you don't believe that let's go
[25:42] to Luke 10.
[25:43] Luke 10 quickly now
[25:46] Luke 10 yeah this lawyer comes to Jesus
[25:49] how can I have eternal life yes Jesus
[25:52] now takes a parable and a certain man
[25:54] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho that
[25:57] talks about the church ages the
[25:59] transition from Ephesus to leadership
[26:01] amen I don't have time to label on this
[26:03] we preached on this before and they fell
[26:05] among certain Deeds
[26:07] they went to genome nationalism
[26:13] a bunch of Thieves
[26:16] struck him off his raiment there's only
[26:19] one Church age that he stripped up the
[26:21] arraignment and they don't know it yes
[26:22] what age is that
[26:25] so he said ask for us to recognize where
[26:26] this guy is
[26:28] amen amen and he wounded him and
[26:31] departed leaving him off dead
[26:36] so he's in a leadership Spirit
[26:37] leadership condition
[26:39] and they come down a certain priest that
[26:42] way
[26:43] and when they saw him he passed by the
[26:45] other side
[26:47] so notice now
[26:48] Billy Graham couldn't do anything for
[26:50] him yeah
[26:54] or you think I'm making this up these
[26:56] are Parables put there yes
[27:00] now likewise they Levites when he was at
[27:04] the place came and looked at him and
[27:05] passed the other way Oral Roberts

[27:11] and notice one was a priest one was a
[27:14] levite one day supposed to be
[27:16] consecrated yes

[27:20] this man
[27:21] when they're supposed to have compassion
[27:26] but they left him there
[27:29] amen
[27:33] but now there comes another man
[27:36] a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came
[27:40] where he was
[27:42] and when he saw him he had compassion on
[27:45] him amen now I want you to know this is

[27:53] oh somebody
[27:57] this is the son of man coming down amen
[28:00] right
[28:01] when he saw in here compassion on him
[28:04] went to him and he bound up his wounds
[28:07] who bangs up the hoons amen who binds up
[28:10] the Brokenhearted amen and watch what he
[28:13] begins to do very unusual now have you
[28:15] ever seen a wounded man and you go pour
[28:17] oil and wine on him
[28:22] so he takes you straight from a natural
[28:23] story and he blows it up
[28:26] amen amen
[28:28] to a Supernatural story right
[28:30] pouring in oil
[28:33] pouring in wine amen which hospital you

[28:43] have you ever seen our dead man that got
[28:45] start pouring wine on him
[28:50] but the Lord knows how to raise you up
[28:52] from your condition
[28:54] spiritually
[28:56] this man needed a spiritual awakening
[28:59] and the only thing that could awaken him
[29:01] spiritually was oil and wine amen amen
[29:04] the Holy Ghost and the stimulation of
[29:06] Revelation that's the opening of the
[29:08] word
[29:12] amen and he set him on his own peace a
[29:15] peace represents power and the fourth
[29:18] piece flying in this age amen he sets
[29:21] him up on a flying eagle amen amen
[29:24] amen amen oh Hallelujah
[29:29] walk with the spirit of God now come on
[29:31] there's oil and wine there amen there's
[29:35] the son of man there he sets him on his
[29:37] own beast and he brings him into the
[29:39] inner courts
[29:40] into the holiest of holies amen and took
[29:44] care of him amen yes amen and on the
[29:47] morrow when he departed he took out two
[29:50] pulls and he gives you to Branham the
[29:54] host amen

[29:58] he comes you to the cave
[30:01] you should have two sons

[30:08] and he says unto him take care of him
[30:10] amen and whatsoever thou spendest
[30:13] when I come I will repay thee amen now
[30:18] watch what he does then he lives in two
[30:20] pools
[30:21] but he gives the third for the man to
[30:24] speak amen he says whatsoever
[30:28] he spend it more so the man could maybe
[30:31] didn't want to spend more
[30:34] but if he ever has free to realize that
[30:36] the price is already paid
[30:39] amen that the son of man had already
[30:42] said that you can operate the third pool
[30:45] he says when I come again I will repay
[30:47] you amen so that third pool is actually
[30:50] a secret amen amen that's why it's not
[30:52] written there it's a secret
[30:55] he leaves two pools
[30:58] and he leaves the third for the man to
[31:00] operate because the man must be able to
[31:02] speak in us I have need of this yeah
[31:05] amen amen I have need of this and
[31:08] whatsoever you need amen he shall give
[31:11] it to you amen
[31:13] amen amen so while you are here
[31:16] under the prophet under the host Don't
[31:19] Be Afraid Amen to speak
[31:22] amen speak the revelation of your faith
[31:25] amen hallelujah because the son of man
[31:28] has already made provision
[31:30] the son of man is already expecting you
[31:32] to speak and when he comes back he says
[31:35] will I find faith on the earth will I
[31:37] find a thoughtful faith will I find
[31:39] rapturing Faith amen yes amen don't be a
[31:43] to it now
[31:44] when he comes back do I have anything to
[31:47] repay you no this guy was very good eh
[31:49] he was satisfied with the first two
[31:51] pulls
[31:52] he didn't ask for nothing else
[32:01] and ordered room service
[32:03] now that's very expensive
[32:06] but if somebody ever tells you order
[32:08] what you can order what you want yes
[32:11] yes you go to town amen because he
[32:14] better have the backing to pay the bill
[32:16] otherwise don't tell you order what you
[32:18] want
[32:21] amen
[32:23] have any inexhaustible Fountain amen he
[32:26] must own a candle on a thousand years
[32:28] amen yes amen for him to tell you
[32:31] whatsoever you spend it more when I come
[32:33] back I will repay amen
[32:39] [Music]
[32:50] don't dabble with faith amen let your
[32:54] faith rise up to such a level amen that
[32:56] God Amen one day when he's having a
[32:58] conference
[33:00] and the accused of the Brethren is
[33:02] coming and he's mocking the men of God
[33:04] he's accused of the Brethren and he's
[33:06] saying all men are wicked and evil
[33:09] God tells him have you considered my
[33:13] servant job
[33:16] because right now he is boasting he has
[33:19] all the church world
[33:21] yes everyone is the seated now is the
[33:23] God of this evil age the Bible says he's
[33:26] the accused of the brethren amen and
[33:28] there's some set up in heaven where he
[33:30] can go and present himself
[33:32] and make accusation
[33:35] now you must be saying I've deceived the
[33:39] whole world
[33:40] but God is looking at you now have you
[33:45] considered my son yes have you
[33:47] considered my daughter
[33:50] he's not like them in all the Earth
[33:52] filled with my oil
[33:55] filled with my wine
[33:57] amen hallelujah
[33:59] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[34:01] amen how many of you want to say now
[34:04] don't be satisfied if you want to save
[34:05] more wine
[34:06] amen
[34:08] yes more he left the third part for you
[34:12] amen hallelujah
[34:14] one more scripture then we'll
[34:17] so what's Revelation 5 10 says he has
[34:20] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[34:22] two things
[34:24] two things we are priests amen and we
[34:28] must be anointed as priests amen because
[34:30] the king ruled in his kingdom and
[34:32] everything is subject to him but in
[34:34] order for for you to operate in that
[34:36] level of authority as a king
[34:40] you have to become a priest
[34:43] because as a priest a priest lives a
[34:46] consecrated life
[34:48] amen totally separates from the cares of
[34:50] this life and he offers up spiritual
[34:52] sacrifices
[34:54] now I'm teaching you how to walk as a
[34:56] king on the Earth but the secret to
[34:59] walking in your dominion and your
[35:01] sonship Authority is in priesthood is in
[35:05] servantude amen
[35:10] hope you're catching this because a
[35:12] priest yeah in Hebrews 13 it says
[35:15] by him therefore let us offer the
[35:18] sacrifice of praise to God continually
[35:21] that is the fruit of our lips giving
[35:23] thanks to his name yes amen so as a
[35:26] priest we've got to offer up spiritual
[35:28] sacrifices
[35:31] I'm gonna say it again as a priest we've
[35:35] got to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[35:37] what our sacrifices giving thanks to his
[35:40] name giving praise to his name Amen in
[35:43] fact there's only one prerequisite to
[35:45] give thanks to the Lord to give praise
[35:47] to the Lord and what is that
[35:49] let everything that has
[35:58] been using the only time you exempt from
[36:00] that is if you don't have breath
[36:02] but the Bible says let everything that
[36:05] have breath
[36:06] praise the Lord amen do you have breath
[36:11] amen say praise the Lord praise the Lord
[36:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[36:17] in order for you not to operate in this
[36:19] realm of the third pool
[36:21] in order for you to operate in this
[36:22] level become a priest
[36:25] become anointed
[36:27] amen become amen the one who is giving
[36:31] praise to God who is serving his fellow
[36:33] brothers
[36:34] you can walk in sonship authority
[36:37] yes he has made us Kings and Priests
[36:40] amen
[36:41] don't only walk around as a servant now
[36:45] it's a dual role
[36:47] you can't only be servant to them have
[36:49] no sense of authority
[36:52] because your submission to God will make
[36:55] room and he will lift you up to a
[36:57] sonship Authority amen
[37:00] amen blessed be his name in order to
[37:03] rule and Reign on the earth as a king
[37:06] and operate the spoken word we must live
[37:09] like a priest consecrated to the Lord
[37:11] and set apart for his glory amen amen
[37:15] now think of it every single servant of
[37:18] God
[37:19] that God used for his glory and the
[37:22] operating that realm of a king
[37:24] when I say King when he's when the word
[37:27] went forth it was fulfilled
[37:29] that's what the king does right
[37:31] when he speaks a word
[37:34] the entire Kingdom
[37:37] obese
[37:39] amen you are the king of this Earth amen
[37:42] hello
[37:43] [Music]
[37:45] operates in your kingdom yes
[37:49] yes amen
[37:51] hear what he says
[37:52] and humble thyself you know people want
[37:54] Power
[37:55] and really they don't know what power is
[37:58] they don't really know what goes with it
[38:00] the Way Up Is Down
[38:04] always if you want Power see how humble
[38:06] you can get just get away from all your
[38:09] worldly thinking there's consecration
[38:10] now yes we're not away from our topic
[38:13] amen get away from worldly thinking yes
[38:16] humble yourself before God Amen and then
[38:19] you got more power than the man that
[38:21] runs all over the building making a big
[38:23] lot of noise see because you are able to
[38:26] conquer yourself consecration
[38:31] and commit yourself to Christ
[38:33] consecration yeah to humble yourself
[38:36] before it that's really power amen amen
[38:40] you watch that man speak
[38:43] amen
[38:45] he speaks with authority because he
[38:48] knows his word he's backed amen
[38:51] amen hallelujah
[38:55] one more scripture amen Revelation 3 and
[38:58] 21 says to him that overcometh I will
[39:02] grant to sit with me in my Throne now
[39:06] before we go and inherit Heavenly things
[39:08] I want you to overcome the flesh
[39:12] because when you overcome the
[39:16] Heavenly places in his throne which is a
[39:19] tingly domain
[39:20] in his throne which is 2 million over
[39:23] the Earth
[39:25] come on now catch this
[39:28] to him who overcomes the flesh yes and
[39:30] walks after the spirit amen you are
[39:33] going to sit with him in his throne
[39:36] Ephesians 2 6 says yet raise us up
[39:39] together and made us sit together in
[39:41] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[39:44] amen
[39:46] hallelujah thank you
[39:48] sit in Heavenly places is more than a
[39:51] figure of speech
[39:52] amen it is the spiritual reality for the
[39:54] believer because of our Union with
[39:56] Christ we reap the benefit of his
[39:59] position of divine Authority amen
