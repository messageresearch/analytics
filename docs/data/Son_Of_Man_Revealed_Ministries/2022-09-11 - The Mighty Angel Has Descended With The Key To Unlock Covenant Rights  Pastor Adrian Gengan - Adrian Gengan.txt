Genesis 12 and 1 says now the Lord had said unto Abram amen get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy father's house you got to separate from all unbelief right and then he says unto a land I will show thee so he's going to show him the land and I will make of thee a great nation amen I Will Bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing amen we can learn something from there we are blessed to be a blessing amen we shouldn't live selfish lives but we are blessed to be a blessing amen amen and I will bless them that bless me so your blessing is coming back to you as well amen and cursed him that cursed me and indeed shall all families of the earth be blessed amen amen amen hallelujah amen may God have blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen just want to say this morning in return thanks to the Lord amen that oh we have a beautiful baby girl she's the cutest most beautiful thing you've ever seen amen and we thank the Lord for the safe delivery it's happened according to how we had decided to happen amen though the doctors were putting pressure and you know trying to get the surgical procedures done but amen we persevered and we prevailed amen and we thank God for that amen so baby is doing well and Karen's recovering amen so we pray that the Lord will continue to be with him and bless them we'd like to thank everyone that's been praying amen hallelujah everybody feeling good in the house of the Lord amen so the mighty angel has descended with the key to unlock Covenant rights amen amen now God always has a covenant people and we sitting here this morning I Covenant people amen we are not without a covenant amen we have a love Covenant we have a Grace Covenant amen now a covenant is an agreement you remember a few weeks ago we spoke on the love Covenant between Mr and Mrs Jesus Christ amen so we're speaking on this morning the mighty Angel has descended to unlock with the key to unlock Covenant rights so God has a covenant people and a covenant is an agreement a contract treaty promise or a pledge now God's first Covenant was based on a conditional Covenant he could eat of every tree in the garden except one and one tree was forbidden to eat from and that was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen and now in order for the Covenant to work manner to play his part in keeping keeping his end of the deal if we disobeyed God and head of the tree it will unlock something that Adam had never experienced before [Music] and that was them amen the fall brought death to the human race and through the entire Earth into chaos when man fell the Earth fell creation fell now there was only eternal life before the fall everything was made to live forever amen the Trees Animals fish of the sea never had to die death was unheard of in the Garden of Eden Adam lived in a world of perfect faith amen therefore he could speak to the winds and the winds would obey him he controlled animal life he had two million of a botany life and over the cattle and over every piece of the field amen amen how do we know he lived in a world of perfect Faith because that's how the second Adam lived and we watched when the second Adam came in on the scene he controlled all the elements amen amen so when God told Adam you shall surely die Not only would it be a physical death but man will lose his authority and Dominion Power he would lose his godship over the Earth this was the death of him being an amateur God and eventually it would lead to a physical death because remember he did not die immediately Adam Sue went on to live so man never lived a day in the eyes of God he never lived one day in the eyes of God because the Bible says that A Thousand Years is as one day unto the Lord and no man has ever lived a thousand years so in the eyes of God man never lived today yes so the women not the man she broke the Covenant because she stepped across the borders of God's word now if she broke a covenant with a husband she broke a covenant with God he says when you break your promise and your Covenant to God's word that's what caused so many illegitimate church members so many denominations because they broke their covenants with God amen the Covenant at first between man and wife was co-equal the properties but now after the fall there is another covenant made now she was no longer ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant find that in the message marriage and divorce he says we got another Covenant now now it's another Covenant now there is a covenant for the product and the byproduct notice before brought trouble death to every creature of creation making a difference in all nature amen so he says first was just a covenant Adam and Eve was co-equal one man and one woman now the woman sinned and what does she do she throwed them all to death and God had to make a covenant by that and not a covenant Unity is writing Genesis 3 16 he made another Covenant so the world had to be repopulated not by the original creation of God like in the beginning not by the original creation but by sex desire through women amen now you know the original thought of God that man was supposed to the spoken word to speak for children amen but this was the permissive will now that a woman would conceive and be a child amen but God is Not Taken unawares remember all of this happened so that he could express his attributes amen amen yes amen he says that's the reason Jesus had to come through a woman to bring it back to its original beginning again without sex desire he is Virgin born amen straight away amen 2000 years ago he brought forth a man without sexual desire amen Hallelujah there will come a time when it won't be no more sex but God shall call his children from the dust of the Earth [Music] amen back like there was in the original not through any women but through the molding of the clay and the cosmic light and the petroleum he will create again like he did Adam at the first time Jesus made this possible by God making himself a man and coming to the world so that he could die through this woman amen ask yourself the Believers that have gone on their body of decayed in the grave how are they going to get another body to another home but God shall call them out from the dust of the earth that's what he's saying there amen God's going to create them bodies again amen hallelujah amen in order for them to become glorified bodies they need flesh bodies again but if I take you to the graves this morning and I dig up the graves you will see that they have disintegrated yes amen oh yes but you are the Creator God will speak amen and that's the loud voice you will cry with a loud voice amen and they will come up in their bodies Resurrection bodies amen amen and the theophonies will dovetail with that body and it will become a glorified body amen yes thank you amen amen so we see from Adam to Abraham the Covenant change from conditional to an unconditional now it's no longer what you can do to keep the word but it's the Holy Ghost and power that is keeping me alive yeah it's the I will Covenant it's nothing we can do to inherit salvation but God rich in his Mercy has given us salvation full and free this morning give God a hand of Praise amen he says I want you to notice again there was also two covenants give one Covenant was given to Adam which was on conditions like law if you will not touch this then you will live but if you touch this you will die that was a law then there was another law given to Abraham which was by Grace unconditionally your little mistakes doesn't hinder God's grace to you oh thank you Lord hallelujah your thoughts and your failures amen cannot separate you from the love of Christ amen hallelujah do you know what unconditional love is it's nothing that you can do amen he says I have saved you and your seat after you that is a type of Calvary not a type of Adam Covenant he say abrahamic Covenant amen hallelujah and here in the message God's provide a place of worship and he said and that's the law that Christians must live by do we have any Christians here this morning he says we must live by the unconditional Covenant look that's the way Christians must live is not what we do ourselves but what he has done for us Christ has already been sacrificed no more amen necessary for you to go purge yourself and go through purgatory and burn candles amen but by one sacrifice amen the price of redemption has been paid foreign Lord amen holy Christ has already been sacrificed not he will be he has been it's a finished product yes he lived he died rose again ascended into heaven and has come back in the form of the Holy Ghost he says so if you finish work with God Christ knowing no sin became my sin that I might stand in this place amen aren't you thankful for that [Music] took our place at Calgary Church amen therefore we must go to Calgary and die yes down at the cross where my savior died amen amen and because of the law of sin and death is in the body you have to die to become reconciled with him amen now God has a new covenant the New Testament means New Covenant amen we find their medical types of covenants I'll just give you three covenants that we use you know about the Chinese laundromat yes how we couldn't write English so he wrote something on the paper and he told he gave one piece to you if you gave your laundry there amen and the only way you could collect your laundry is that those two pieces might match perfectly together yes maybe you could try to impersonate some writing and bring back another piece of paper like what the nominationalism have done but when they match it it's not a perfect match amen the two ends must compare to get your clothes then there was in the Oriental days how they took an animal and they stood between the animal and toyed apart they tore the body apart amen and a covenant was confirmed and when they brought the two pieces together they had to adapt here just exactly and then the third type is when God is showing us with the sacrifice of Jesus Christ that he took Jesus to Calvary he tore him apart amen and he received the body up into heaven and he sent the spirit down to the Earth amen amen down to us and the same spirit that was on him must be upon us and it must stop chill together because in that same spirit that moves Jesus from the dead dwells in you he will also Quicken I just want to party amen amen Hallelujah this is what the prophet says now he says here and the church he's been given a covenant amen what is the Covenant the Covenant is the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the Seed of Abraham bring him to us so he's saying Abraham brought this blessing to us and then God making this Covenant that every man that's called into this grace of God by the Holy Ghost has the same promise that Abraham had of eternal life amen amen amen Galatians 3 and verse 13 amen the prophet is just not making this up he's taking it out of scripture he says Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law the curse of that first Covenant being made in curse for us for it is written curse is everyone that hanged on a tree and in verse 14 he says that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles to Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith amen so let's not that's just the opening remarks amen let's not lose focus of what we are saying the mighty Angel has descended with the King to unlock our covenant rights so who is this Mighty angel the mighty angel of Revelation 10 is the Covenant angel it's the same angel that left Moses Hallelujah [Applause] oh come on now amen anoint your faith amen this morning he's the same angel and he says yeah who is this Mighty angel you're in Souls that are in prison now he says he saw this Mighty Angel come down do we have Revelation 10 there let's read this first I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven so this is not an angel this is not an Earthly Angel this is not the seven churches Messengers right this is an angel from heaven amen amen a mighty Angel an archangel come down from heaven and he is clothed with a what a cloud let's go back to the previous picture clothed with a cloud somebody came from the U.S recently and he said he can't place a scripture and tie the cloud with it he's a very close family member of the prophet and his statement is that he cannot tie the cloud with scripture being in the message you cannot come here to family relation yes right you have to come through revelation brother Brandon when he is talking about the vision of the constellation of angels he said if the vision is scripture it must be interpreted by scripture yes amen and when he said I'm going to Revelation 10 to interpret the scripture [Music] a bunch of unbelievers amen let's go I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven and his clothes on the cloud and a rainbow upon his head and his face was as it was a son and his sweetest pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and when the seven pandas adapted their voices so he cries with a loud voice first right he says when he cried with a loud voice seven Pounders after their voices and when seven Thunders and after their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven singer to me seal up those things which the Seventh Son has acted and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which there is that there should be time no longer and he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels amen when he singular not she there goes your women Prophet yes when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished amen yes as he has declared to his servants the prophets as we stand here this morning declaring that that is past tense the seventh angel has sounded the mystery of God has been revealed and we are beneficiaries of that Revelation this morning yes amen that's right let's see what the property is saying you now telling us who this Mighty Angel is and he said he saw this Mighty Angel come down put his foot on the land and on the sea that was Christ yes how did Rainbow always yeah he was the Covenant Angel which was Christ you see that in Souls that are in prison now right what's this angel coming to do yeah and he's just a sign of the end he says the angel brings the next announcement then in the bridge between the seven Church ages and the seventh seal he says when the seals are broke and the Mystery is revealed down come the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the sea and upon the land with a rainbow always hit now remember this seventh angel is on Earth at the time of his coming amen amen amen glory to God Amen what's the matter with the unbelievers or make-believers give Revelation 10 is not fulfilled then the seventh angel is already gone up the sea yes some say Revelation 10 he's going directly to the Jews that's what the prophet said right in the preach how many of you read that that's what he says yes he must come to the Jews we have no problem with that statement because when he is coming down he comes to dismiss his wife to the palace and he's making his way to the Jews he's the voice of the Resurrection also the voice of the archangel so he's coming with a shout cries with a loud voice shout a message going forth to gather the living Saints soon you will call out for the dead in Christ and when the dead in Christ shall rise we shall be upon the Earth for about 40 days and then we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and we'll go to meet the Lord in the air and then you must go Moses and Elijah must come in on the scene yes amen amen you can't twist the word of God it will land up every time so Revelation 10 yes he's coming and the seventh angel messenger is on Earth at the time of this coming yes yes he was on Earth in 1963 at the time of his coming I wish I had water for some who couldn't believe that to swallow it amen amen hallelujah now listen what he says the book is not revealed until the church ages and denominational ages has run out so my question to you is the book revealed strong answer now is the book revealed then as Church ages and denominational ages run out has to be we are in the bright age amen amen latest he has groping in darkness but the bride is glorious amen the bride is clothed in fine linen amen hallelujah amen amen the bride is not a but deserted and barren woman yes but the pride is a fruitful woman bringing life of his life Spirit of his Spirit word of his word in fact she hears him thank you now the mighty angel said the revelation of the seals to the seventh angel yeah he says in the preach he says and he took the book talking about the lamb now remember he took the book in heaven midnight Revelation 5 he said he took the book open the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people amen that's the Covenant people not to reveal it to the denominations not to reveal it to the church world but he has come to reveal it to his people amen a covenant people amen now he is only bringing back the book of redemption to the ones that has a covenant only Covenant people will receive it message and you go tonight go this evening and evangelize and see how many people accept it only Covenant people will receive the message of the hour amen only Covenant people will believe it some may have sympathized with the message like the seventy this they hang around amen but soon they had to be exposed amen only prominent people will believe it others will laugh with it others will Market the message but a covenant for people will rejoice at the coming of the mighty Angel and the sounding of the seventh Angels amen he many many men who are these people these people were elected and predestinated from before the foundation of the world amen amen this morning find your representation in that group of people amen now we do not believe in pre-existence of Souls understand what the prophet is saying now when he elected your predestinated you back in the mind of God he doesn't mean you were in a body yes let's read what the prophet says he says it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word the that is it way back there too far for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but issue and neither was born so it was the thought that was in God's mind that you were predestinated elected he says here and neither had done good and evil see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed so through the bedding ground of time you became expressed through the womb of your mother and God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was sick in your family there may have been many other siblings um but God brought you oh thank you Lord amen because you are seed amen I believe we can give God praise you that this morning amen nothing we have done sometimes you ask ourselves oh god brother how come you chose me yeah it's not him that willeth nor him that runeth but it's God that showed Mercy amen thank you amen amen Jacob alone had the seed and that is why he had what the ones who can't predestinated thoughts and other seed have respect to the birthright and Covenant of God amen the Bride of Jesus Christ is very respectful we value the books right amen these are the qualities of the people that possess the seed of God that possess the gene of God we respect the birthright and the Covenant of God if you are to see it you will hear that word amen amen amen hallelujah amen aren't you glad it was the sweetest word you ever heard amen amen the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and your age hallelujah amen amen look at that he doesn't just leave us your own devices but the spirit of God so make it your your worst and foremost duty to be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen because that feeling will Empower you and you will receive the work for your age amen you will recognize your day and its message amen the Covenant is also coming to those that have his name yes any son and daughter of God Bears the name of the father yes amen Hallelujah you always sense yes you are always daughters you always boy's name yet you had amnesia because of your first birth but there was something promised to come to awaken the pride and take away Amnesia and that was 700 voices Amen to reveal the name that were found in the book to let you know that you are not the son of child and Alia Branham but you are the son of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen he says now we'll finish that in the scripture this week to prove to you that this Covenant has to be confirmed to the Royal Seed of Abraham which are taking which are the people out of the Gentiles not the Jews so who are the Royal Seed of Abraham he says they are gentiles hey people out of the Gentiles for his names sick taking it for his name the church that got his name will come back to him amen now you see why they don't want to come back to him because he called out to them the call was made and the Lord cried at midnight amen behold the bridegroom cometh going out to meet him and they were asking what's his name we told them the Lord Jesus Christ they say no we're looking for the father Son and the Holy Ghost we said he is one Lord this thing but we want to see three amen their blood vision amen amen amen and they're going to get a shock when they get to heaven and they see one seated on the throne in all majesty and in all power amen hallelujah and these Jehovah witnessing the message who call himself believe two Lord doctrines sure they're going to ask Jesus because that's the only body you're going to see got him yes because God is a spirit foreign they're going to go to Jesus and say where's the father where's your father and you say when you have seen me amen [Applause] [Music] amen hallelujah so the Church of God his name will come back into him because that's who she is her life I hope that the church truly understands it what I mean you people this is now in the first seal I'm going to call you Pride for the first time he called her the bride why he was going to expose the soap was the poor exposed it to one husband now you was really easy to form the marriage ceremony he says I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand it now what is the evidence of a covenant people everybody following this morning amen what is the evidence of a covenant people let's see what the property is saying amen some of the actual fruits of it he says when on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost the life was given to the church and that church went right out and produced they wrote behind that church a book of Acts you know of what it did because it was Christ in the apostles so if it is Christ in us the hope of glory we must write another book of Acts amen amen but I mean if you know it's going to be something you strive for yes yes you can't live in this life and just be caught up in the cares of his life let us here I will choke you yes that's right let us yell will kill the spirit okay that's right you have got to stay in the word amen you've got to stay in the right atmosphere amen you cannot associate with the only people with worldly living worldly talk we have got to be a separated people and Covenant people is a separate people amen we'll talk differently who walk differently amen and they must take note that you have been with Jesus amen they must tell you but how come you are not like the other Christians amen there's something different about you amen now so we that's the evidence they must write another book of Acts the Covenant people were given a sign now remember when the mighty angel came in the days of Abraham and he descended you remember two other angels Abraham said my Lord you saw one Lord then the mighty Angel comes and he gives him a sign amen and the prophet says you're witnessing the final sign yes before the Judgment of God form because that was the final sign he deserved Sarah's heart with his back turned to the tent yes of higher fell and saw them he's going to repeat or has repeated and we're waiting for the fire to fall listen he says but remember he elected predestinated now we know who that was we said it was a seed right we are going in sequence here so follow along we describe what the elected who was the predestinated and who has the four-day Covenant Abraham and his group got a messenger we also had a messenger right he said aha watch what he did he gave them a sign that the time was near for the fire to fall now it's fire that we are looking for atomic fire the wrath of God now that messenger did something he spoke about a woman that he had his back turned to and he told her she was doubting what he was saying told her conditions and what was going to happen is that right did he say that the son of man would reveal himself in the same way that day well do you believe that's the truth amen now he says well here stands a woman now he's going to perform the same sign yes right so you see only the Covenant people recognized it yes we know it's the last sign given to the Gentile world listen now he says here and in The Invisible Union of the church the bride to Christ the messing death messenger is here now which is Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever now don't get confused because remember it's a son of man revealing these son of man so it's Jesus Christ using his body so he's telling them in the invisible Union of the church the bride to Christ that messenger is here now which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now do you believe you could tell me what's the matter with this woman before I even look it up amen I want you to know that same spirit is here right now I can discern your baby Hearts Hallelujah do you believe it yes yeah it deserves it now she's suffering with cancer that's right it's on her breast she's got a boy on her mind he's suffering with a kind of mental condition nervous condition and complications that's right do you believe that now he says now do you believe without looking at this woman the Lord Jesus can tell me what's her trouble so he's back turned to her now he says if you believe with all your heart you can have that baby that you're asking God for wow don't have evil thoughts in your heart God can design your eyes amen amen he says this one not only is she watching the baby this woman is wanting a great thing too that's not a baby but she's wanting the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what to do if you get rid of them cigarettes now you also know she's smoking how many of you here want to get rid of your cigarettes you're drinking amen amen your bad habits your porn addiction your lust you lusting up to a woman amen amen you can lay down this morning amen he says if you get rid of them cigarettes God will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost go believe it see do you believe have faith in God to the care if I needed to find this quote because it's kind of a long quote and I I didn't want to Pace today it's in the Easter seal amen in the Easter seal speech on the 14th of April 1965 amen it's kind of a long porch but I wanted to read it now because this is what we're speaking about that the mighty Angel has descended with the key to unlock Covenant rights and in order to unlock the cabinet right of dominion over the Earth because remember we lost inheritance to the Earth he must bring back the title deed of our inheritance paragraph 108. amen in the Easter seal you got it so he sealed he says yeah amen he seals the Covenant by the Seal of circumcision so remember Abraham has a seal of circumcision for his Covenant and he says that God gives you a promise this body is going to be glorified with him at the end time but you see you have to get a clearance of that deed have you got it amen clearance of the deed isn't there so what happens any title deed has to get clear to show that there's no other claim being made you have to get a clearance of that deed and the clarity is where everything against it has been stricken off and you got the abstract to it meaning you have the original title deal you've got the seal it's yours everything in on it belongs to you and when you believe on the on Jesus Christ for your savior and repent and are baptized and come up to believe him God recognizes our repentance and our free towards him and sends down the abstract and the abstract is the Assurance it's the guarantee that everything that was held against you you thoroughly repented and the property is bought and you hold the abstract for the assurance let somebody try put you off the land say he belongs and you with the abstract in your hand let him try to do it there ain't no law in the land can do it because you hold the abstract amen amen listen up there's no devil no church no theology that can always get the boundaries of God's proven abstract [Music] that's why this Angel is putting his foot on land and sea he's suppressing the powers yes yes amen this is inheritance to the Earth and demon powers are coming out of the land and out of the sea read Revelation 13 you'll see a beast coming out of the land and a beast coming out of the sea that is why the mighty Angel is putting his foot on the land and he's putting his foot on the sea he's suppressing those two Powers amen not only is that angel suppressing those two Powers the four angels are holding back the winds with no Wars and strife that is why Putin cannot unleash a full-scale attack because God's people are still on the Earth [Music] man amen even he's wondering what's happening write him a letter tell him you ain't pressing any red button when I'm here no no amen hallelujah so he says nobody can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and Abstract right he says here the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized Us in Jesus Christ we just are sure to raise as he raised because potentially we have already raised in him and you are quicker and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition amen amen do you feel Rapture this morning amen amen brings your body into a raptured condition already in the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in your mortal body it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies this abstract it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds now he says in 118 it's the Holy Spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message [Music] the holy spirit is dancing out on his thoughts that will believe that message everything in the Bible that was promised is to the believer and when you accept it in its fullness God knows that you do it he gives you the abstract to that then every promise that's made is in your position and the Holy Spirit is there to Quicken that to you what kind of people should we be in 121 he says it's God's promise he poured his spirit in the last days that when that what they would do notice lay downs on the sea everything that was in God's promise I support my spirit in the last days upon All Flesh your old man shall dream dreams your young men shall see his visions and all these different promises that he made everything is laying right there in God's promise Jesus redeemed it to us he says now in 122 if we ordained to be on the ground Like an Eagle walking in chicken's Nest the holy spirit is here to find you yes you know that these things are supposed to happen quickly your raptured to meet it and now you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Oh What A Promise what a heavenly father who would give us these things the spirit quickens their fellowship with God so that they call the dead back to life laying within you you can call the dead back to life come on say Amen somebody that's the Holy Spirit potential that lays within you you have the honest of the Resurrection now he says they laid their bodies upon the dead they came to life listen closely that they done the same things that Jesus did because the Same Spirit was upon him was upon them if one spirit makes a man act this way it makes the other one act that way you see we need to raise up into that level of faith don't think that it's not possible all things are possible to him that believeth amen I'm sure you're sitting in your chairs there this morning can feel the level of unbelief when that is being preached right now because we do not believe that we are the power laying within us but the Bible says that these signs shall follow them they believe amen Mark 16 is just true today as it was in the days of the disciples amen but we've got to raise up to that level of faith amen hallelujah amen now how many of you know that in Covenant requires a token you know when in any marriage ceremony yeah brother Brandon is talking he says I would require a token of you this is in the marriage vows now that this Covenant betwixt you that's been made will always be kept so the ring the wedding band is a token signifying that a covenant has been made everybody been to a wedding everyone looking so sad and so serious amen everybody been to a wedding everybody enjoys the Biryani but before the Biryani comes there's a covenant between the man and woman I gotta say man and woman okay it's not man and man and woman and woman a covenant is made between man and woman and the minister asked them to seal this Covenant I require a token okay sometimes the token costs a lot amen now he says if the token is not applied the Covenant is enough it was of non-effect not talking about your wedding ring now it doesn't mean you stop wearing a wedding ring that your Covenant is enough that is until death do your part right now listen what brother Branham says in the message talk and he says you might say well I've done this I've done all these things and I've paid my tithes I belong to the church I do all of this he says but God requires the token show that you've been identified with your sacrifice the one you claim to have the one that you believe that you have okay and when we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we have already accepted in Christ that is our token that all we have need is already purchased in him we are identified without token the token must be ready we're going to a point with this now because God has given us the token as well he says the blood Covenant blood is not recognized without the token the word assures us of the promise the token is the sign of the purchase has been made for us and you know he says full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to the Token amen no other way is there that could ever be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word not with not what somebody has put into you and added to it but what God has said about it now here's the token that he's given us here's the wedding ring that God has given us in the invisible Union of Christ he says hallelujah now notice you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky and you're wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace Grace is Our Winning band amen 24 carats gold will let the woman decide how many carat ring they want how many carat diamond would you like amen five carat might be too big for your finger amen but Grace amen is that wedding band unmerited Grace he says a wedding band of Grace and merited of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world now watch where did he slip the wedding band so you came into the world with the Grace Covenant over your life Hallelujah you may have been wandering around but you had Grace covering you a lot of other people didn't make it in this life a lot of other people ended up on the streets ended up drug addicts drunkards listen let's read now he knew you before the foundation of the world he slipped the wedding band on you there I would require a token of you thank you before the foundation of the world now who can lay a charge against God's elect nobody you came from the eternities with a wedding band of Grace put your name on the book there what is Thanksgiving hallelujah praise our God Amen now let's close with this to unlock anything in this life you need a key yes right we need a key to unlock anything in this life so we are saying the mighty Angel has descended with a key to unlock our covenant rights we just explained what a covenant is we just showed you the signs of the Covenant the token that's required for the Covenant amen but the rights of the covenants are locked up just not anybody can have Covenant rights you've got to be called You're going to be predestinated you're going to be chosen amen and we have been given the key when the mighty Angel has descended with the open book the title deed to man's inheritance he now follows our Lord to take

not descended in his day that's right amen but he was the messenger of the age Hallelujah Wesley unlocked another portion of sanctification but when the messenger of Revelation 10 7 comes he will bring further light or Lewis teaching yes you will bring further light on Wesley's teaching he will bring further light on the Pentecostals baptism of the Holy Ghost yes because all the mystery of God should be finished so he loses him the church shall live by faith and he spoke about justification the seventh angel comes and he tells you about real justification that it's as though you've never done it in the first place amen that's the justification that Luther never preached about then the second walk of Grace which was sanctification the blood amen telling you now the seventh angel brings for the light to the blood telling you it's not the literal blood but the light the chemical of the blood is dried up but it's the life that was in the blood that must come upon the believer amen
