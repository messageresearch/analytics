[19:56] every month and
[19:57] and enjoy the blessing of the ministry
[20:00] amen
[20:01] amen and fight for modesty so we're glad
[20:03] to have with you this morning
[20:05] made the sacrifice i've been leaving his
[20:06] church whatever arrangements you have to
[20:08] make
[20:09] and uh spend the time with us to preach
[20:11] the word of god
[20:12] so pray god to bless us this morning
[20:14] amen and now if you remember the last
[20:16] message he preached here
[20:19] let's see we've got a good memory
[20:22] you can you know
[20:28] nobody preach a masterpiece
[20:32] yeah he preached masterpiece
[20:36] now this morning i believe we are all
[20:39] masterpieces of god
[20:40] amen are we a masterpieces because of
[20:44] the word
[20:44] amen we are masterpieces because of the
[20:48] word
[20:49] see we have received him the word
[20:53] so god is only interested in the word so
[20:56] we are part of him the word
[20:58] and god sees us all because he was the
[21:01] masterpiece
[21:02] we are also master people man that we
[21:05] can believe him
[21:06] and receive him will be rejected around
[21:10] the world
[21:11] in this entire message but you know we
[21:14] can become part of that
[21:15] and just remember we cannot serve god if
[21:18] he hasn't called us
[21:19] [Music]
[21:20] we cannot serve him if he has not
[21:22] revealed his basics for us amen amen
[21:24] so we take him for them so he revealed
[21:27] it
[21:28] we can come and serve because a lot of
[21:30] people have rejected it and
[21:31] uh got all manner of uh excuses and
[21:35] you know they've got negative things to
[21:37] say about the message we had all these
[21:39] things
[21:39] the working of the holy spirit but uh
[21:42] you know
[21:43] reveal to you it's part of you amen you
[21:46] know it's part of you
[21:48] nothing can take it away that's the
[21:50] greatest thing that happened to us
[21:53] see that we have received so i believe
[21:55] we are all masterpieces
[21:57] we may have our faults and failures but
[22:00] the prophet said
[22:01] god looks in our hearts
[22:04] and he sees what we think about those
[22:06] things amen
[22:08] see if it is flesh we are not perfect
[22:09] here
[22:11] but we have one that is perfect the
[22:14] problem said now
[22:15] the negative is reflecting the perfect
[22:18] one
[22:19] so there's a perfect one there there's a
[22:21] negative here it talks about the trees
[22:23] and everything
[22:24] and there's it to beyond there's a
[22:26] perfect world over there
[22:27] i'll be glad for that amen so don't look
[22:29] at all that just know you are under the
[22:31] blood
[22:32] and god sees what we think about how we
[22:34] live
[22:35] and our faults and failures and how we
[22:37] feel about everything
[22:39] that's the main thing so we just
[22:41] appreciate it
[22:42] praise the lord let's stand this morning
[22:44] and i'm sure we're going to be blessed
[22:46] in the presence of jehovah and we'll be
[22:49] come to worship him and
[22:51] and acknowledge him amen
[22:54] thank god for that amen
[22:57] we also remember the uh the live
[23:00] streaming audience over there that
[23:02] got to make a way for them they that are
[23:05] not well and sick and things like that
[23:12] [Music]
[23:17] raise our hands
[23:25] [Music]
[23:39] [Music]
[23:48] [Music]

[25:04] [Music]
[25:11] this is indeed another happy privilege
[25:15] we can come into your divine presence
[25:18] there's no better place this morning
[25:20] that we have never been
[25:22] to come into the presence of great
[25:24] chipotle
[25:26] all
[25:33] [Music]
[25:36] father your word says you are the same
[25:38] yesterday today
[25:40] god that does not change in his ways and
[25:42] his nature and his character
[25:44] yes and we are so confident that we got
[25:47] to know you through this message
[25:49] if it has not been for this message in
[25:51] the prophet that you would have said
[25:54] or we don't know where we would have
[25:55] been we don't know what
[25:57] understanding would have had of the word
[25:59] would have been in a state of confusion
[26:01] in babylon
[26:03] but it's your grace this morning that
[26:04] has picked us up
[26:06] this brought us into heavenly places
[26:08] into christ jesus this morning
[26:11] we humble ourselves before you break
[26:12] jehovah
[26:14] i absolutely that you forgive us of all
[26:16] thoughts and all failures
[26:18] oh we have many this morning we are not
[26:20] worthy
[26:21] but we thank you for what you have done
[26:23] for us lord
[26:24] that we can be covered and shadowed by
[26:27] the divine blood of christ
[26:28] thank you lord that when you look at us
[26:30] this morning you don't see any of our
[26:32] inequity you don't see any of our
[26:33] trespasses
[26:35] but you see the blood that is perfect
[26:38] and you see a bride that is spotless
[26:40] this morning
[26:41] a bride that is a virtuous bride that
[26:44] can come and stand in your divine
[26:45] presence
[26:46] lord knowing who she is this morning
[26:50] may you bless the meaning of thy word or
[26:52] the inspiration that we have
[26:55] when you take me out of the way but just
[26:56] use me as a vessel to speak
[26:59] things that i need for this morning in
[27:02] jesus name
[27:04] amen
[27:16] it's good to be again in the house of
[27:18] the lord
[27:24] for the opportunity to minister
[27:28] may the lord bless you and all that have
[27:30] come this morning
[27:31] those are listening
[27:36] hebrews chapter 7 we're going to read
[27:38] from verse 15.
[27:45] also
[27:51] hebrews chapter 7 on verse 15
[27:54] and it is yet far more evident for that
[27:56] after the similitude of melchizedek
[27:59] meaning the likeness of melchizedek
[28:02] another priest
[28:04] who is made not after the law of eternal
[28:07] commandment
[28:08] but after the power of an endless life
[28:10] for he testified a priest forever after
[28:13] the order of melchizedek
[28:15] but there is barely a disallowing of the
[28:17] commandment going
[28:19] before the weakness and unprofitable
[28:21] thereof
[28:22] for the law made nothing perfect but the
[28:25] bringing in of a better hope
[28:27] did by which we draw nigh unto god
[28:31] and in as much as not without an oath he
[28:33] was made priest
[28:34] for they for those priests were made
[28:37] with an old
[28:38] uh without an oath but this would then
[28:40] hold by him that say that him
[28:42] the lord's swear and will not repent
[28:45] thou art a priest forever
[28:46] after the order of melchizedek by so
[28:49] much
[28:50] was jesus made a charity of a better
[28:53] covenant
[28:54] and they truly were many priests because
[28:56] they were they were not suffered to
[28:58] continue by reason of death but this man
[29:01] because he continued forever had an
[29:03] unchangeable
[29:04] priesthood let me want to turn to um
[29:09] look of luke
[29:13] chapter eight
[29:22] verse 43
[29:34] luke chapter 8 from verse 43 it says and
[29:38] a woman having an issue of blood 12
[29:40] years
[29:41] which had spent all her living upon
[29:42] physicians
[29:44] neither could be healed of any came
[29:47] behind him and touched the border of his
[29:49] garment
[29:49] that's the hymn of his garment and
[29:51] immediately a issue of blood extension
[29:54] and jesus said who touched me in all
[29:57] tonight peter and dave which
[29:59] were with him said master the multitude
[30:02] throng thee and presley and says
[30:04] thou who touch me and jesus said
[30:07] somebody had touched me for i perceived
[30:09] that virtue
[30:10] is gone out of me the lord blessed being
[30:13] of his word you may take your seats
[30:15] now this country reading another two
[30:16] verses and when the woman saw that she
[30:18] was not hit
[30:20] she came trembling and falling down
[30:22] before him she declared unto him
[30:24] before all the people for what caused
[30:26] she had touched him and how she was
[30:28] healed immediately
[30:29] and he said unto her daughter be of good
[30:31] comfort thy
[30:32] faith and may be whole go in peace
[30:37] the lord bless his word brothers and
[30:38] sisters and uh we trust you all and
[30:40] happy this morning
[30:42] and we thank god for his grace we thank
[30:44] god for his healing his wonderful
[30:46] testimony the things that he's doing
[30:48] uh in our lives we truly appreciate you
[30:51] this morning
[30:53] now i was just caught between two
[30:56] thoughts and
[30:57] about what i would thought i would share
[30:59] this morning
[31:01] and i thought i would speak on the
[31:02] tablets maybe in the day of atonement
[31:04] but
[31:05] um i seem to have just drifted away from
[31:08] that
[31:09] the scripture that we read here the
[31:11] title this morning is the
[31:13] hymn of evie and it's a thought that we
[31:16] took in our church and i'm
[31:18] just trying to put a couple of sermons
[31:21] together
[31:22] so that it'll make sense this morning
[31:26] paul here in the book of hebrews that we
[31:28] just read
[31:30] he speaks about jesus christ being a
[31:31] high priest
[31:34] and it's this same paulia that was
[31:36] struck by a pillar of fire
[31:38] on the road to damascus that's right and
[31:41] this paul asks a question
[31:43] the question was who art thou lord amen
[31:47] now it's not that paul did not recognize
[31:49] who the people of fire was or did not
[31:51] recognize the pearl of fire yeah
[31:53] that was not the thing because bellamy
[31:55] said that paul
[31:57] asked the question who are the lord and
[32:08] paul had no problem with that but the
[32:10] question that paul was really asking
[32:12] lord or elohim how are you unfolding or
[32:15] revealing yourself today
[32:18] that was paul's question because paul
[32:21] could not fail them out now
[32:22] or god was revealing himself in that day
[32:25] and then he asked the question who art
[32:27] thou lord or
[32:29] how are you revealing yourself to us
[32:31] today
[32:33] and revelation can only come from god
[32:36] paul was a student of the world
[32:38] paul was what the bible would call a
[32:41] pharisee or pharisees
[32:43] he had no problem reading the old
[32:44] testament and interpreting according to
[32:46] what had been taught but yeah with all
[32:49] the understanding and the teaching that
[32:51] he'd been brought up but he still did
[32:52] not recognize
[32:54] the first coming of jesus christ he
[32:56] missed it many of them missed it that
[32:58] day
[33:00] and the lord answered to him and the
[33:03] lord said i
[33:04] am jesus that thou persecuted us
[33:07] and that must have pricked his heart
[33:10] because here was
[33:11] paul who thought he was a righteous son
[33:14] of god
[33:15] persecuting the christians that believe
[33:17] and follow the doctrine of jesus christ
[33:20] and he thought he was doing the right
[33:22] thing until god had revealed him that i
[33:24] am jesus
[33:25] this spirit of fire this light that has
[33:28] struck it out i am actually jesus
[33:30] so that must have picked his heart
[33:32] knowing that he was persecuting the one
[33:34] that he was actually worshiping himself
[33:38] and paul let me know how to separate
[33:40] himself
[33:42] uh go into the wilderness going to the
[33:44] desert so god would reveal
[33:46] exactly his word for the hour
[33:50] paul knew who god of yesterday was he
[33:53] had no problem with that
[33:54] but paul did not know who the god of
[33:56] today was
[33:58] that's always a problem brothers and
[34:00] sisters he's recognizing your day and
[34:02] his message
[34:03] recognizing god in your day even
[34:05] recognizing the token for your day like
[34:07] philippines says the token kept changing
[34:11] and we know brother and says god
[34:13] answered the question to paul
[34:15] and he says that he revealed to paul
[34:17] that jehovah the old testament was jesus
[34:20] of the new testament meaning that he was
[34:22] the fullness of the goddess made body
[34:25] in a in a flesh body jesus christ amen
[34:28] just the same revelation that was given
[34:31] to paul
[34:32] was the same revelation given to peter
[34:34] when peter said thou art the christ the
[34:36] son of the living god
[34:38] was the same revelation that was given
[34:40] to john when john when john said he was
[34:42] the word
[34:43] and the in the beginning was the word
[34:45] the word was with god
[34:47] the word was god and the word was made
[34:49] flesh
[34:51] it was the exact same revelation given
[34:53] to the woman at the well
[34:55] she said we know when when messiah
[34:57] cometh he do with these things so
[34:59] she had a revelation that this was the
[35:01] messiah
[35:03] without the theology of what paul had
[35:05] god revealed into a bio revelation
[35:08] being a predestinated seed amen just
[35:11] like
[35:12] martha and mother when christ came to
[35:15] the grave of letters
[35:17] martha said i believe that thou art the
[35:19] christ the son of god
[35:21] same revelation revealed to all of them
[35:24] now he's being revealed to paul
[35:26] the apostle and prophet
[35:30] so the revelation does not change
[35:32] brothers and sisters
[35:33] the lamb says he is the word he is god
[35:36] and the only thing that changes about
[35:38] him is his veil
[35:39] the way he expresses himself
[35:42] now we know that jesus was a prophet
[35:45] scripture tells us he was a prophet we
[35:47] know he was prophet king and priest
[35:50] moses in the book of deuteronomy says
[35:52] the lord that god will raise up a
[35:54] prophet like an unto me
[35:56] and he came as a prophet but he was the
[35:58] prophet of prophets
[36:00] yes all the old testament prophets
[36:02] brother man said had a portion of the
[36:04] word
[36:05] and every one of them reflected him to
[36:08] come
[36:09] but jesus christ was not a portion of
[36:11] the word he was the fullest of the world
[36:13] all prophets made together in one body
[36:18] god tabernacle in human flesh and
[36:21] brother bannon says that god before the
[36:23] foundation of the world
[36:25] he saw himself becoming flesh amen
[36:28] god saw himself becoming a man and going
[36:31] to calvary
[36:32] god saw himself do the work of
[36:34] redemption yet there was one part of
[36:36] redemption at calvary
[36:39] the other part is completed today
[36:41] because brother barron says
[36:43] revelation is progressive amen and god's
[36:46] vision of himself becoming flesh
[36:48] is progressive brother branham does not
[36:50] stop at jesus christ 2000 years ago
[36:53] brother says that when god saw himself
[36:55] becoming flesh he saw himself becoming
[36:57] flesh and you and i
[36:58] amen today that's a quote amen
[37:02] you see he saw himself becoming flesh in
[37:04] you and i and that's why the
[37:06] scripture says at that day you will know
[37:09] that i am in the father
[37:10] the father is in me i am in you and you
[37:13] are
[37:14] in me and brother says that day is this
[37:16] day
[37:17] yes in other words that scripture is
[37:20] being fulfilled brothers and sisters in
[37:22] our
[37:22] very day and hour that we are living
[37:27] now jesus we know came as son of man he
[37:29] came as prophet
[37:31] john 16 verse 14 says the people
[37:33] testified
[37:34] truly this was the prophet that was
[37:36] prophesied to come into the world
[37:41] now when we think of melchizedek we know
[37:43] he was king and priest of the most high
[37:45] god
[37:46] and these things we know i'm just going
[37:48] to rush to them
[37:49] the bible says melchizedek had no father
[37:52] no mother
[37:52] no beginning of days no ending of life
[37:55] he was an eternal being
[37:56] we know there's only one that is eternal
[37:58] that's god himself
[38:01] eternal god who is an eternal priest and
[38:04] is a an eternal king meaning that his
[38:07] priesthood does not end
[38:09] his kingship does not end
[38:12] yet paul in the book of hebrews tells us
[38:14] there is another king and priest
[38:17] who is in the order and likeness of
[38:19] melchizedek
[38:22] meaning that there is another priesthood
[38:24] after melchizedek
[38:27] but how do you get an order for example
[38:30] like brother adam explains it alien was
[38:32] god's first high priest
[38:34] amen when aaron died his son eliezer
[38:36] became high priest
[38:38] means that he took the death of one high
[38:40] priest to get another high priest
[38:42] and it became the iranian order and that
[38:46] brought in that order but the high
[38:47] priest had to die for another high
[38:49] priest to succeed
[38:51] but here we find out here that jesus
[38:53] christ is a high priest after the order
[38:55] of melchizedek
[38:56] yet melchizedek is an eternal being and
[38:58] cannot die absolutely
[39:00] so how are you going to get an order
[39:01] without a death
[39:10] now each one that passed away in early
[39:13] high priest aaronic priesthood
[39:16] they were uh the ironic priesthood had a
[39:20] uh the same bloodline means that it had
[39:22] to be the
[39:23] son of a high priest the son of a high
[39:25] priest the son of the high priest
[39:26] it had to be the same bloodline
[39:28] continuously amen
[39:31] god kept the priesthood in the same
[39:33] bloodline but so to the heavenly
[39:35] priesthood brothers and sisters
[39:37] melchizedek who was god himself having a
[39:41] particular bloodline
[39:43] jesus christ was no different from him
[39:45] the scripture tells us
[39:48] also this is what brother
[39:54] says
[39:56] i think i skipped too far
[40:08] can
[40:12] now jesus christ but the remnant says in
[40:14] the bible says that
[40:15] he was none other than melchizedek
[40:17] himself like paul says amen right
[40:19] amen it was not that uh the man speaks
[40:23] about melchizedek he says melchizedek
[40:25] was the pre-incarnate jesus christ amen
[40:28] he says about melchizedek he says
[40:30] melchizedek was the theophany of jesus
[40:33] christ in flesh
[40:34] amen means up to the enemy
[40:37] didn't die but melchizedek just
[40:39] continued in another body jesus christ
[40:45] not two different persons but one same
[40:48] person means that it's the same blood
[40:50] that was in melchizedek is the same
[40:52] blood in jesus christ
[40:54] and you know brothers and sisters the
[40:55] bible says that we are made kings and
[40:57] priests also
[40:58] amen after the order of jesus christ
[41:02] yet we ought to have the same bloodline
[41:04] as him and that's why in the book of
[41:07] christ the mystery god revealed
[41:08] brahman says you become the blood of
[41:10] jesus christ by the holy ghost
[41:12] amen by the spirit when the blood cell
[41:14] burst at calvary
[41:16] he says the light of the bloodshed came
[41:18] out upon the believers being the same
[41:20] blood from jesus christ
[41:21] comes upon the believer in spirit form
[41:24] it makes you the blood of jesus christ
[41:26] by the spirit amen that's how we become
[41:29] kings and priests
[41:30] after the order of jesus christ
[41:34] now the scripture tells us here
[41:37] that god instructed moses to wash aaron
[41:40] the high priest
[41:41] to anoint him with the anointing oil i
[41:44] think i mentioned this when i came at
[41:46] one time to wash him to anoint him and
[41:49] to dress him up
[41:51] there was a prophet that had to do that
[41:53] work aiden was washed by the prophet
[41:56] anointed by the prophet dressed by the
[41:58] prophet
[41:59] and he had to walk a holy walk into the
[42:01] most holy place
[42:02] absolutely amen pauline
[42:05] said that regarding the earthly priests
[42:08] he says that there was no place for
[42:11] jesus christ here on earth to be a high
[42:13] priest because the earth had the earthly
[42:15] priest
[42:16] he said yet jesus christ had somewhat to
[42:19] offer also
[42:20] as a high priest he said the earthly
[42:23] priest offered blood according to the
[42:25] law of the old testament
[42:26] which was the blood of bulls and goats
[42:29] it was an
[42:30] old covenant without an eternal promise
[42:33] but once a year they had to go and
[42:34] repeat the same sacrifice
[42:37] and paul says but jesus christ was
[42:39] different
[42:40] he says that he didn't have to go once a
[42:43] year to calvary
[42:45] his sacrifice was perfect that he went
[42:47] once and once done the job
[42:51] and his covenant was not the covenant of
[42:53] the old testament of the law
[42:55] but the new covenant of grace
[42:59] like i said jesus christ was melchizedek
[43:02] in flesh
[43:03] god tabernacle in human flesh there's no
[43:06] other high priest that could redeem
[43:08] the people with his own blood they come
[43:11] with the blood of bulls and goats
[43:13] a lower life is what they brought and
[43:15] the lower life could not redeem a higher
[43:17] life unit
[43:19] so god himself had to come with a higher
[43:21] life than our own life with his own life
[43:23] he'd come and give me that calvary to
[43:26] redeem us
[43:30] now we want to watch jesus fulfill the
[43:34] requirements of this high priest
[43:37] and to see how they missed him in that
[43:38] day and to see how they miss him today
[43:44] we said aaron had to wash our aven was
[43:47] washed by moses
[43:48] anointed by moses dressed by moses but
[43:51] his walk was his part
[43:54] jesus when he come to john and he come
[43:56] to a prophet also
[43:58] at jordan he was baptized in the water
[44:01] by
[44:02] the prophet john the baptist and brother
[44:03] man says the lamb was going to the
[44:05] washing
[44:07] just like the high priest even had went
[44:09] to the prophet moses and moses washed
[44:12] him
[44:12] jesus christ comes to jordan and john
[44:14] the baptist washes him
[44:16] and john the baptist identifies him at
[44:19] the river john he says behold the lamb
[44:21] of god
[44:21] that taketh away the sins of the world
[44:23] because jesus christ was both the lamb
[44:26] and the high priest together
[44:29] so john and the prophet washes god high
[44:32] priest
[44:33] god's lamb high priests and them and
[44:36] then
[44:36] joining his anointed right when the
[44:40] dove descends or the holy ghost descends
[44:43] in the form of the doubt
[44:45] means that he is anointed now as god's
[44:47] high priest and jordan
[44:49] washed and anointed at jordan
[44:53] now you watch this two types here when
[44:55] the dove is descending a jordan
[44:59] you remember when saul was anointed as
[45:01] king
[45:02] the scripture says that he was anointed
[45:04] with a vial of oil
[45:07] now a vile is a small portion of oil
[45:10] but yet when the scripture speaks about
[45:12] david being anointed
[45:14] a man up to his own heart he says david
[45:16] was anointed with the horner for him
[45:19] means that to saul it was a portion of
[45:21] the holy ghost
[45:22] but to david intact it was the fullness
[45:24] of the holy ghost
[45:26] in david amen
[45:29] and yet jordan we find that when the
[45:32] holy ghost came down the form of the dub
[45:34] it was not a vial of the holy ghost but
[45:38] it was the fullness of the holy ghost
[45:40] that come down in jesus christ
[45:41] because jesus was the son of david
[45:44] and david was anointed as king and jesus
[45:48] is anointed as king also
[45:54] this is the one type the second type is
[45:56] john said was the word made flesh in the
[46:00] book of john he says
[46:01] jesus christ was the word made flesh and
[46:04] the prophet tells us
[46:06] he says that the rose of sharon
[46:10] is the anointing of the word let me
[46:12] explain it now original quotation the
[46:14] seed of discrepancy
[46:16] says notice he is the rose of sharon the
[46:19] sweet smelling savor
[46:21] the anointing upon his people you cannot
[46:24] come before him with any creep
[46:26] or anything but anointed with the rose
[46:29] of sharon
[46:30] the word so yeah brother is saying that
[46:33] rose of sharon which is which is a
[46:35] perfume in the anointing oil he said
[46:37] it's the word and when john identifies
[46:41] him in the book of john he says in the
[46:42] beginning was the word the word was with
[46:44] god the word
[46:45] was god and the word was made flesh
[46:47] means that he was the anointing perfume
[46:49] the anointing oil
[46:50] of the rose of sharon so the word
[46:54] was the anointing the anointing that
[46:56] anointed priest and anointed king
[46:59] that's what he was he was anointed with
[47:01] the word because he was the word he was
[47:03] king and priest
[47:04] amen absolutely he was the word made
[47:06] flesh the perfume in the anointing oil
[47:09] the high priest is anointed with the
[47:11] anointing oil
[47:13] perfume with the rose of sharon before
[47:15] he enters the most holy place
[47:19] christ our height priest the lamb is
[47:21] anointed with anointing oil
[47:23] before he also goes to the most holy
[47:25] place
[47:29] how do they get this perfume from the
[47:30] rules of sharon
[47:33] prophet tells us this and you can read
[47:34] it up also he says they crush that rose
[47:37] of shame
[47:39] they crush it till the liquid comes out
[47:42] of it and they take the liquid the
[47:43] liquid has a fragrance in it
[47:45] and they mix that fragrance into the uh
[47:48] olive oil
[47:49] and it's perfumed with the rose of
[47:51] sharon and that anoints a person
[47:55] we know the type there is christ that
[47:57] was crushed at calvary
[47:59] till he bled and the blood was the
[48:01] anointing oil
[48:02] blam says the blood was the rose of
[48:04] sharon it was a sweet spelling saver
[48:07] see the prophet says our our sacrifices
[48:10] was a stink in the nose of god amen he
[48:13] says but when christ
[48:14] bled at calgary the rose that was
[48:16] crushed he says when the blood moves out
[48:18] of him
[48:19] it became a sweet smelling saber unto
[48:21] god
[48:24] now we know the role of sharon is the
[48:26] word and brother
[48:27] says on calvary the word died for you
[48:31] he says the word bled for you at calvary
[48:34] and the prophet tells us that the word
[48:36] also saves you
[48:38] and the word heals you as well amen
[48:41] crush that cowardly
[48:42] amen so we find out yet that he is
[48:45] anointed both as king
[48:49] and priest yeah in his earthly journey
[48:52] he was washed he was anointed he was
[48:55] anointed right now he has to be dressed
[48:57] right
[48:59] and the scripture says that when he went
[49:01] to mount transfiguration
[49:03] that his garment had changed
[49:06] that his garment became a pure white
[49:08] linen garment
[49:12] you know the scripture says though our
[49:14] sins being scarlet
[49:16] yet they shall be as white as that
[49:19] and they were talking about jesus christ
[49:21] who is white as well
[49:22] so now there was a transfiguration when
[49:24] his garment was brilliant white it was
[49:27] white as wolf
[49:29] in other words god was changing his
[49:30] garment because he was the lamb
[49:33] that was clothed with the world that was
[49:34] going to be the sacrifice
[49:37] a pure white garment and he was a lamb
[49:40] that pleased god
[49:41] that's what the voice said this is my
[49:43] beloved son whom i'm well pleased with
[49:45] yeah he him
[49:48] pure white lemon which was the holiness
[49:51] of the priest
[49:52] that's what he want washed anointed
[49:56] and dressed right dressed to be our lamb
[49:59] and our priest
[50:01] watch another dressing this morning here
[50:04] he is in pilates hall
[50:08] and we keep this in mind the lamb is
[50:11] getting ready for the atonement to
[50:13] sacrifice
[50:15] and when the lamb comes to pilate pilate
[50:18] asks him a question
[50:20] he says are you the king of the jews
[50:23] imagine that brother he's coming as a
[50:25] lamb for the sacrifice
[50:27] yet pilate uh pilate has the lamb for
[50:29] inspection but pilate
[50:31] asks the lamb a question are you the
[50:33] king of the jews
[50:35] because he was both king and priest
[50:39] and after pilate examines him and asks
[50:42] him are you the king of the jews christ
[50:44] says thou sayest i am
[50:46] what does pilate do next father itself
[50:48] find no fault
[50:50] so by pilate's own confession pilate is
[50:53] confessing that he is both king
[50:55] and priest lamb is examined
[50:58] found without fog but the lamb is
[51:01] questioned are you king of the jews
[51:05] then the soldier takes him away and the
[51:08] bible says that they change his garment
[51:10] again
[51:11] from the white garment that he is using
[51:14] now remember
[51:15] he was transfigured on mount
[51:17] transfiguration
[51:18] he is a is a lamb a white garment of
[51:21] world
[51:22] but yeah they take off his garment the
[51:23] bible says and they put on him
[51:25] another garment
[51:28] now the scripture says they put on a
[51:30] robe that was purple in color
[51:33] purple is a royal color it's a color of
[51:36] royalty
[51:37] in other words they took off their the
[51:39] normal garment that he used and they put
[51:41] on a kingly garment onto him
[51:43] amen and the scripture said they bowed
[51:45] to him and mocked him
[51:47] and called him hail king of the jews
[51:49] hail king of the jews
[51:51] didn't know what they were doing they
[51:53] took the lamb and they were presenting
[51:55] himself a king
[51:55] amen amen
[52:00] in the book of matthew they say they put
[52:02] a scarlet robe upon him
[52:04] because he took our sins they shamed him
[52:08] and they mocked him
[52:09] but he took it for us because he was our
[52:11] lamb but mark says he put a purple robe
[52:14] on him
[52:14] because he was our king also
[52:18] luke says they put a gorgeous robe on
[52:20] him you see
[52:21] it was a king's robe but also this was
[52:24] the most
[52:25] beautiful rope the most beautiful
[52:27] sacrifice that god was pleased with
[52:30] himself
[52:33] after dressing him up in royalty they
[52:36] plated a crown of thorns
[52:37] and they crowned him the lamb
[52:41] was crowned at calvary king
[52:45] they hit him on their head the bible
[52:46] says why on their head
[52:50] because when the sinner had taken his
[52:51] sacrifice to the temple
[52:53] they had to lay their hands on the head
[52:55] of the lamb and confess their sins
[52:58] yeah not knowing what they were doing
[53:00] they were hitting him with their hands
[53:01] on his head
[53:02] but what they were actually doing in
[53:04] time confessing the sins of the world
[53:07] upon him every stage
[53:10] he was being proven even by unbelievers
[53:14] that jesus christ was both king and
[53:16] priest
[53:16] amen was god manifested in flesh he was
[53:20] mercy
[53:23] let me drop this here why did they put a
[53:26] crown of thorns upon
[53:28] him what was adam's curse in the garden
[53:31] of eden
[53:33] adam was not cursed but the bible says
[53:35] the ground was cursed for adam's sake
[53:38] means the ground will bring forth thorns
[53:40] and tissues
[53:41] that was the curse and yeah he was
[53:45] second adam
[53:46] and he came to undo what first adam done
[53:49] so he took adam's curse upon himself
[53:51] when he took the
[53:53] the crown of thorns he took that curse
[53:55] and he put it upon himself
[53:56] at calgary being the second adam
[54:00] he took adam's curse
[54:07] washed anointed right and dressed amen
[54:11] now the high priest before going into
[54:13] the holies of holies
[54:15] he takes off his royal dress and he puts
[54:17] on a simple linen garment
[54:20] in humility he enters into the chicano
[54:22] glory
[54:23] beyond the veil and jesus was stripped
[54:26] of his purple outfit his proper gown
[54:29] and dressed into plain linen cloth again
[54:32] and he entered into the most holy place
[54:34] calvary
[54:36] a high priest had to walk right he had
[54:39] to walk a certain walk
[54:42] and a high priest when he walked into
[54:43] the most holy place
[54:45] the scripture tells us he had golden
[54:47] bells and pomegranate up the hymns of
[54:50] his garment
[54:52] the gold bells and the pomegranate they
[54:54] rang holy holy holy
[54:58] the sound the sounds of the bells are
[55:00] tied to the hem of his garments
[55:02] and he tells everybody that he is still
[55:04] alive amen
[55:06] that's what we commonly know about the
[55:08] golden bell and the pomegranate
[55:10] pomegranate that it just rings out
[55:14] and makes a sound to tell us the high
[55:16] priest is alive
[55:19] now jesus walked through gata
[55:22] at gallery it was the most holiest walk
[55:27] you find in exodus chapter 28 34
[55:30] it speaks about the gold and pomegranate
[55:32] in other words on the hem of his gown on
[55:34] the hip of the high piece gum they'll
[55:36] have
[55:36] one gold bell stitch and one pomegranate
[55:40] red parmesan and one gold bell one red
[55:42] pomegranate
[55:44] that's how they stitched it and the book
[55:47] of accents says
[55:48] golden pomegranate gold and prominently
[55:50] that was the process
[55:52] the gold bells at the hymn of his
[55:54] garment
[55:56] he represents the king
[55:57] [Music]
[55:59] the gold bells represent deity god
[56:02] himself
[56:05] gold we know is the most precious
[56:07] mineral
[56:09] it speaks of god himself but the
[56:12] pomegranate
[56:13] is red in color and rare is the color of
[56:17] the original earth
[56:18] because adam's adam's name means red
[56:23] adam's name means earth also because the
[56:26] earth was red the ground
[56:30] is red pomegranate types the flesh
[56:35] which is this earth means gold
[56:38] and pomegranate on the hands of the high
[56:40] priest curd
[56:41] he speaks of deity coming down to earth
[56:44] amen means deity of god becoming flesh
[56:48] in a human body
[56:51] pomegranate is red it represents the
[56:55] blood
[56:55] the sacrifice the death
[56:58] yet inside of the pomegranate it is said
[57:02] to have
[57:02] many seeds and seeds speak of life
[57:07] because he is life amen but inside the
[57:10] pomegranate are many seeds
[57:14] now the jews tell us this when they open
[57:18] up a pomegranate
[57:20] they find all these seeds in the
[57:21] pomegranate he says when they counted it
[57:25] he says most of this pomegranate counted
[57:28] this
[57:28] counted 613 seeds
[57:33] let's keep that in mind the pomegranate
[57:37] is red in color it speaks of death but
[57:39] the seeds in it speak of life
[57:42] because he was he conquered death and
[57:44] given us life
[57:48] there's so many seeds inside of a
[57:50] pomegranate
[57:51] and if you buy one you will see that but
[57:54] it speaks of god who have many seeds
[57:56] inside of him
[57:57] which is you and i those that were
[58:00] hidden before the foundation of the
[58:02] world
[58:03] and were in him when he was expressed in
[58:05] a body of flesh here on earth
[58:08] like brother ben said when he come on
[58:09] earth you were inside of him
[58:11] means he was that pomegranate with many
[58:14] seeds instead of him
[58:16] so when you went when he went to calvary
[58:18] you were inside of him also
[58:23] so we were the many seeds inside of him
[58:25] the pomegranate represents christ who
[58:27] came to us to die
[58:29] for those that were part of him for our
[58:32] salvation and for our healing
[58:35] he's a high priest that can be touched
[58:36] by the feelings of our infirmity
[58:40] gold bells speak of both king
[58:44] and priest he entered into the most holy
[58:48] place at calvary
[58:49] as both king and priest
[58:53] on the cross he hung as a lamb that was
[58:56] bleeding for our sins
[58:58] but on the cross they wrote above his
[59:00] head here
[59:01] is jesus king of the jews king
[59:04] and priest again in revelation chapter 5
[59:08] when a strong angel asks the question
[59:09] who is worthy
[59:11] to open the book they found no man in
[59:14] heaven
[59:15] worthy to open the book and one of the
[59:17] others said behold
[59:18] john don't weep the lion of the tribe of
[59:21] judah has prevailed
[59:23] amen but when john turned and looked he
[59:25] saw a lamb again
[59:26] why is both king and priest again all
[59:29] through the scripture
[59:30] he was expressing king and priest
[59:36] this was melchizedek it was god himself
[59:38] in flesh amen
[59:39] unveiling and revealing himself and they
[59:41] were missing
[59:43] prophet king and priest the fullness of
[59:46] god
[59:47] manifested in flesh the world
[59:50] missed his visitation
[59:53] they turned down their pardon they could
[59:57] not recognize him in his first coming
[1:00:05] let me bring this in here this morning
[1:00:08] i want to concentrate on the hymn of the
[1:00:10] high priest garment
[1:00:13] we said the gold bells speaks of deity
[1:00:17] deity on the hem means that deity is
[1:00:20] coming down to earth
[1:00:21] to the lowest place and pronounces god
[1:00:23] hiding in simplicity
[1:00:25] and that's the reason they always missed
[1:00:26] him because of the way he revealed
[1:00:28] himself
[1:00:29] in a simple way the papa grante's
[1:00:33] vows we said was the earth represents
[1:00:35] the earth
[1:00:37] gold is deity so we have deity coming
[1:00:39] coming down to flesh
[1:00:41] means god becoming flesh here on earth
[1:00:44] to redeem man and to heal man
[1:00:47] inside the pomegranate are seeds which
[1:00:50] is life
[1:00:51] many seeds which which represents you
[1:00:53] and i brothers and sisters
[1:00:57] he came for those that were a part of
[1:00:59] him
[1:01:01] now according to the jewish law like i
[1:01:03] said they
[1:01:04] they count in most of its 613 seats
[1:01:08] and some more and some less but taking
[1:01:11] the average it was 613 seats
[1:01:15] which the torah or the jewish bible
[1:01:19] it says it has 613 commands
[1:01:22] or law in the old testament amen
[1:01:26] so what are the jews telling us yet that
[1:01:28] the pomegranate
[1:01:30] represented the full word of god
[1:01:33] because that's what jesus christ was it
[1:01:35] was the full word of god
[1:01:37] manifested in flesh amen but yet the
[1:01:40] seeds represented us
[1:01:41] also because the scripture says obama
[1:01:44] says that we make up the fullness of god
[1:01:50] if you read christ the mystery of god
[1:01:51] revealed the lamb says the fullness of
[1:01:53] god is back in the church again
[1:01:54] because he's come to us
[1:01:58] we are part of the fullness he is the
[1:02:01] word
[1:02:02] the word died for us the word plead for
[1:02:04] us the word saves us
[1:02:06] you can touch him today by believing his
[1:02:09] word
[1:02:10] holding onto his word
[1:02:14] we read a scripture here in the book of
[1:02:15] luke it speaks about a woman
[1:02:19] that had a bloody issue for 12 long
[1:02:21] years
[1:02:25] there's no doctor there's no
[1:02:28] self-proclaimed healer
[1:02:29] there's no medication that could help
[1:02:32] her
[1:02:34] god allows us sometimes to come to a
[1:02:36] place
[1:02:37] where we have no choice but to turn to
[1:02:39] him
[1:02:41] like the prophet says he throws us into
[1:02:43] a state of emergency
[1:02:45] to bring forth a desperation in our
[1:02:47] lives
[1:02:50] she was in a state of emergency she was
[1:02:53] desperate for healing
[1:02:55] but she heard that jesus was to pass
[1:02:58] away
[1:03:00] she was not going to let the opportunity
[1:03:02] pass her
[1:03:03] yes she had faith in him
[1:03:07] she had faith that he was the all
[1:03:09] anointed one
[1:03:10] not just part anointed all of him
[1:03:13] including his government she
[1:03:15] understood that this was the fullness of
[1:03:17] god here in flesh
[1:03:20] she knew a secret that even the
[1:03:22] pharisees and the
[1:03:23] celestials didn't know amen she knew a
[1:03:26] secret that even paul the apostle didn't
[1:03:28] know
[1:03:30] paul wrote most of the new testament by
[1:03:32] this time
[1:03:33] didn't know the secret that this woman
[1:03:35] with the blood issue knew
[1:03:39] you read numbers chapter 15 verse 37 to
[1:03:42] 39
[1:03:44] it says speak unto the children of
[1:03:46] israel
[1:03:47] and put them that they make fringes in
[1:03:49] the borders of their garments throughout
[1:03:51] their generation
[1:03:53] and then they put upon the fringes of
[1:03:54] the borders a ribbon of blue
[1:03:59] and it shall be unto you for a fringe
[1:04:02] the gay may look upon it and remember
[1:04:04] all the commandments of the lord and do
[1:04:07] them
[1:04:08] and they can seek not after your own
[1:04:10] heart and your own eyes
[1:04:12] after which they are used to go whoring
[1:04:16] so what is god telling them telling the
[1:04:18] men of israel yet to do
[1:04:22] he commands them that at the hem of
[1:04:23] their garments to wear fringes
[1:04:26] means they have to sow tassels four
[1:04:29] tassels on the four corners of the
[1:04:30] garment
[1:04:32] on the hem of the gums
[1:04:35] and the purpose of the tassels was to
[1:04:37] remind them
[1:04:39] of the full and complete commandments of
[1:04:42] god
[1:04:43] neither at the hem of their garments
[1:04:46] must be a reminder of the word of god
[1:04:48] the full word of god means again what
[1:04:51] the scripture is showing
[1:04:52] is that the fullness of the word of god
[1:04:54] is going to come down to earth again
[1:04:57] let's bring him right down to the
[1:04:59] garment the hem of the government
[1:05:03] so they so they have the word in the hem
[1:05:06] of the garments
[1:05:08] the lowest part of the earth the word
[1:05:10] becoming flesh representing jesus christ
[1:05:13] means that in type what christ what god
[1:05:16] was saying to the
[1:05:17] men of israel look for him to come keep
[1:05:20] your eyes on the hem of your garment
[1:05:22] because that's how he's coming
[1:05:24] he's going to be the word manifested in
[1:05:26] flesh
[1:05:30] but they missed it they missed the type
[1:05:32] they missed the real thing
[1:05:38] they were supposed to have their eyes
[1:05:40] focused on the hem of their garments
[1:05:42] on the full word of god so they would
[1:05:44] recognize his coming
[1:05:47] they missed it because they did not hold
[1:05:49] on to the word of god
[1:05:52] and it depends what we holding on to
[1:05:54] this morning brothers and sisters
[1:05:56] we can hold on to the word of god and
[1:05:58] we'll identify him today
[1:06:00] we can hold on to a church we can hold
[1:06:02] on to a system
[1:06:03] and we can miss it today but if you hold
[1:06:05] on to the word of god you keep your eyes
[1:06:07] on the full word of god he will reveal
[1:06:09] himself
[1:06:14] now this is what they say when they had
[1:06:17] to tie
[1:06:18] the tassels into the hem of their
[1:06:19] garments there was a special way of
[1:06:22] knotting it
[1:06:24] and when they knotted it the number of
[1:06:26] knots that they had in each tassel
[1:06:28] was 613 knots
[1:06:32] you see what god was being brothers and
[1:06:34] sisters
[1:06:36] representing again even in the north the
[1:06:38] full world or the full command of god
[1:06:41] means that they should not escape or
[1:06:43] take their eyes off the full word of god
[1:06:47] they poke a hole into the garment and
[1:06:48] tie 613 knots
[1:06:50] tapping the full word of the old
[1:06:52] testament law
[1:06:55] the woman here she types the bride of
[1:06:58] jesus christ
[1:07:02] we're living in the day when the world
[1:07:04] is being made such a game brother says
[1:07:06] christ has come the word has come we use
[1:07:09] the same the bright coming of christ
[1:07:11] because he's coming in the bride
[1:07:14] notice the color of the castle is blue
[1:07:17] blue is the color of heaven
[1:07:21] means that the tassels have to be blue
[1:07:23] because heaven is coming down again do
[1:07:25] not
[1:07:26] all the types were there to the jewish
[1:07:28] people
[1:07:29] he was revealing it to them all the time
[1:07:31] but yet they still missed it
[1:07:35] the blue castle is heaven coming down to
[1:07:37] earth
[1:07:38] heaven coming and hiding in simplicity
[1:07:40] and they missed it
[1:07:42] but also blew his fellowship because god
[1:07:45] had lost
[1:07:46] fellowship and god was destroying
[1:07:48] fellowship again
[1:07:50] with man god desires fellowship
[1:07:54] there's something here that the woman
[1:07:55] knew that the others didn't know
[1:08:00] he said this the tassels on the hem of
[1:08:02] the garment
[1:08:03] it also represented the status of the
[1:08:06] stature of a man
[1:08:08] like a high priest when you seen a high
[1:08:10] priest you'll see him with the gold
[1:08:12] bells and the pomegranate you'll know
[1:08:14] his teachers
[1:08:15] you will say that's a high priest
[1:08:17] because you identified what was on the
[1:08:18] hem of the garment
[1:08:20] and i can't hear you some royal tassels
[1:08:23] and maybe
[1:08:23] some gorgeous tassels and when you see
[1:08:25] me know that's the robe of a king
[1:08:27] that's his status he's a king so it
[1:08:31] reveals the status of
[1:08:32] a man
[1:08:35] and the scripture tells us that the high
[1:08:37] priest in the days of jesus
[1:08:39] they began to widen their hymns
[1:08:43] they began to sow more beautiful tassels
[1:08:47] to show how good they were to show how
[1:08:50] impressive their lives were to
[1:08:52] show where they stood in a social
[1:08:53] standing
[1:08:55] so they began to brag about their own
[1:08:57] selves by putting beautiful tassels on
[1:08:59] their garments
[1:09:01] you find in the book of matthew chapter
[1:09:03] 23
[1:09:04] he says but all their works they do for
[1:09:07] to be seen of men
[1:09:09] they make broad their select trees
[1:09:13] which is a leather box that they use
[1:09:15] with scripture written in it
[1:09:17] when they pray they make broad their
[1:09:19] salaries
[1:09:20] and enlarge the borders of their garment
[1:09:24] and love the outermost rooms of feast
[1:09:27] and the chief
[1:09:28] seats in the synagogues greetings in the
[1:09:30] marketplace
[1:09:31] and be called rabbi rabbi rabbi
[1:09:34] so scripture is saying that god given
[1:09:36] them the commandment
[1:09:37] to have four fringes of blue to remember
[1:09:40] the word of god because
[1:09:42] if you keep your eyes on the word you
[1:09:43] will understand how he's going to reveal
[1:09:45] himself
[1:09:46] but yeah they made they got the hem of
[1:09:48] the garments wider and they put the old
[1:09:50] beautiful free
[1:09:51] fringes to be seen in the public that
[1:09:54] men will call him rabbi rabbi rabbi
[1:09:57] self glorification and that's why we got
[1:10:00] to be careful of religion
[1:10:02] amen they were very religious
[1:10:06] they were the most religious praying
[1:10:08] five times a day they were dressed right
[1:10:10] in everything
[1:10:10] but religion is very deceiving amen
[1:10:14] they have religion no problem with
[1:10:16] religion but they denied the
[1:10:17] power thereof they denied the holy ghost
[1:10:20] how god revealed himself in that day
[1:10:22] they denied it because they were
[1:10:24] religious
[1:10:26] and he took the eyes of god's
[1:10:27] commandment focused on the four tassels
[1:10:30] which is the full word of god
[1:10:31] and if you do that it will reveal him to
[1:10:33] you
[1:10:35] they changed the word of god they made
[1:10:37] it more beautiful they changed its color
[1:10:39] and all of those things they men handled
[1:10:41] the word of god
[1:10:42] to suit their own understanding and
[1:10:44] present themselves
[1:10:50] they denied the word of god for the day
[1:10:55] but there was a woman with a blood issue
[1:10:59] she could have looked at the high priest
[1:11:02] and she could have said
[1:11:03] such a beautiful garment such
[1:11:06] wonderful tassels on the hem let me put
[1:11:09] my
[1:11:10] faith in that and grab the hymn of their
[1:11:12] garments
[1:11:13] but the scripture tells us although they
[1:11:15] had beautiful tassels on their garment
[1:11:17] this woman was not moved to go for
[1:11:20] religion
[1:11:21] she would not move to go for something
[1:11:23] that was man-made
[1:11:24] a fate was anchored in the word and the
[1:11:26] word alone
[1:11:31] she was long past religion
[1:11:34] 12 long years she tried everything me
[1:11:37] she tried religion already
[1:11:39] she tried physicians already none of it
[1:11:41] could deliver her
[1:11:43] so she got to a place where she was
[1:11:45] desperate brothers and sisters and
[1:11:47] desperation
[1:11:48] moved there to look for the world
[1:11:52] long past religion even brother man
[1:11:55] tells us
[1:11:57] he says laying of hands is religion
[1:12:00] he says it's a jewish tradition he says
[1:12:03] and people like tradition
[1:12:04] people like religion so they want you to
[1:12:06] lay their hands on him
[1:12:08] and the lamb says but look at the the
[1:12:10] centurion he says lord
[1:12:12] you don't even have to come into my
[1:12:13] house but speak the word
[1:12:15] and it shall be one of it is religion
[1:12:19] the other one is the word be manifested
[1:12:21] in flesh today
[1:12:22] speak the word and move on
[1:12:28] she was tired of religion tying that
[1:12:31] she'd have to come to the high priest
[1:12:33] bring a sacrifice and follow tradition
[1:12:35] all the time
[1:12:37] it didn't help her she was looking for
[1:12:40] something more than religion brothers
[1:12:41] and sisters
[1:12:45] yeah like we said the centurion said
[1:12:48] lord
[1:12:49] you speak the word what was the
[1:12:52] centurion saying
[1:12:54] he was identifying who this man was
[1:12:57] he's only one man that can speak the
[1:12:59] word and that was god himself the logos
[1:13:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:04] he spoke the word into existence yeah
[1:13:07] the centurion is saying you i know who
[1:13:09] you are you are different from all the
[1:13:11] other men
[1:13:11] you are not like a priest like the other
[1:13:13] priest you are the logos yourself speak
[1:13:15] the word
[1:13:16] yes
[1:13:24] what are we saying we gotta go past
[1:13:27] religion
[1:13:28] we gotta go past bible stories this
[1:13:30] morning the world is being manifested in
[1:13:32] flesh and we gotta identify him today
[1:13:35] paul paul no matter how great he was
[1:13:37] paul missed it
[1:13:38] amen until god had grace upon paul and
[1:13:41] revealed to him
[1:13:43] that this is who i am the word made
[1:13:45] flesh according to john
[1:13:46] according to peter christ the son of the
[1:13:48] living god
[1:13:49] and so forth amen
[1:13:52] they missed him and yeah the pharisees
[1:13:55] says he missed him also about a woman
[1:13:57] with a blood issue
[1:13:59] a woman that is unclean she recognized
[1:14:01] something about jesus christ that the
[1:14:03] others were missing
[1:14:08] that is why you're not in one of those
[1:14:10] big churches
[1:14:12] that is why you in one of those fancy
[1:14:14] buildings because you're not running
[1:14:16] after those beautiful castles
[1:14:18] you're not running after the white
[1:14:20] garments the white hemmed of the
[1:14:21] garments
[1:14:22] you're not running after religion this
[1:14:23] morning but you're seeking something
[1:14:26] different
[1:14:29] so this man recognized this was the
[1:14:31] logos inflection speak the word it shall
[1:14:33] be
[1:14:35] because he was the logos in flesh the
[1:14:38] same logos that become flesh that spoke
[1:14:40] squirrels into existence
[1:14:42] brothers and sisters same one
[1:14:45] and belgium said it was not me that was
[1:14:46] speaking he said was him speaking to me
[1:14:53] let me just drop this here because it's
[1:14:54] on my mind
[1:14:56] brother madam says he says the scripture
[1:14:59] that he didn't want to preach on is a
[1:15:02] scripture it says when you say to this
[1:15:03] mountain be
[1:15:04] removed and cast into the sea it shall
[1:15:06] be
[1:15:07] brother ben said he was scared to preach
[1:15:09] in that scripture amen
[1:15:11] and the reason was that he could not
[1:15:12] understand how
[1:15:14] he would do that he said so i avoided
[1:15:18] preaching on the scripture
[1:15:19] most of my life until until that day
[1:15:23] in the wilderness that day when i went
[1:15:27] hunting
[1:15:28] he says and he says i did not speak that
[1:15:31] day
[1:15:31] he said it was my body but he spoke
[1:15:34] through me
[1:15:34] he spoke squirrels to existence
[1:15:39] now i understand the scriptures speak to
[1:15:41] the mountain and
[1:15:42] it will be moved it's not you this
[1:15:45] morning
[1:15:46] but it's him manifested in your place
[1:15:48] that will speak to the mountain to move
[1:15:50] amen the logos again becoming human
[1:15:54] flesh brothers and sisters
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:15:57] they were missing it all the time but
[1:16:00] god does not change
[1:16:01] but anxious god always had skin on him
[1:16:05] she did not have time for religion
[1:16:11] these pharisees should have had the
[1:16:13] right tassels
[1:16:14] to remind them daily about the word of
[1:16:17] god
[1:16:18] the word of god that was going to become
[1:16:20] flesh
[1:16:21] the scripture says the virgin shall
[1:16:22] conceive
[1:16:24] but there is so full of themselves and
[1:16:26] religion they
[1:16:28] miss the word unfolding and revealing
[1:16:30] itself for the day
[1:16:32] what they done is they altered the
[1:16:34] handle of the garment they altered the
[1:16:36] world
[1:16:37] they altered it by altering the tassels
[1:16:40] yes the tassels were meant to remind
[1:16:43] them of the law of god the full word of
[1:16:46] god
[1:16:47] the hebrew word for law is halaqa
[1:16:51] and means the walk or the way
[1:16:56] means it's supposed to have the law at
[1:16:58] the hymn of their garments
[1:17:00] and is supposed to have a certain walk
[1:17:03] and yeah was christ
[1:17:04] christ not just the way they were
[1:17:06] dressed of course he had a gown with
[1:17:08] tassels on it
[1:17:09] but he had a certain walk
[1:17:13] because he was the law he was the word
[1:17:16] and in his walk to calgary he was about
[1:17:18] to pass a woman with the blood issue
[1:17:21] means that in his word there's people
[1:17:23] that he's going to pass by
[1:17:25] absolutely people that are going to
[1:17:27] identify him as the word of god identify
[1:17:30] him as jehovah god
[1:17:31] it's them that he's walking past this
[1:17:33] morning
[1:17:37] yeah he has the law he has the word
[1:17:41] because he is the word
[1:17:42] and it means the walk or the way because
[1:17:44] he is the winner
[1:17:48] means that he is our high priest with
[1:17:50] gold bells and pomegranate
[1:17:52] ringing holy holy holy he was god's high
[1:17:55] priest he was god's king
[1:17:57] he was melchizedek in flesh
[1:18:01] this woman was looking for something
[1:18:04] but the beauty part about this woman she
[1:18:06] recognized a day
[1:18:08] and a message
[1:18:14] why jesus and not go to the high priest
[1:18:18] why he is him and not there him because
[1:18:22] the scripture speaks about the hymn of
[1:18:23] the government
[1:18:26] in other words this woman was watching
[1:18:28] scripture
[1:18:30] she was waiting for scripture to unfold
[1:18:32] and reveal
[1:18:33] in itself and she recognized that jesus
[1:18:36] christ was scripture being fulfilled
[1:18:47] says but unto you that fear my name
[1:18:50] shall the son of righteousness arise
[1:18:52] with healing in his wings
[1:18:54] and he shall go far and grow up as calm
[1:18:57] of the storm
[1:19:01] now this is old testament scripture
[1:19:04] malachi the last book
[1:19:06] means that this sister with the blood
[1:19:09] issue
[1:19:10] had already read that scripture she
[1:19:13] already known
[1:19:14] that that the son of man was going to
[1:19:16] come with healing in his wings
[1:19:19] so she knows she's got a blood issue she
[1:19:22] but if only i can identify that son of
[1:19:24] man
[1:19:24] i know i'm going to be healed of my
[1:19:26] blood issue amen
[1:19:28] so she knew the scripture because it's
[1:19:30] old testament scripture but she was
[1:19:32] waiting for the fulfillment of it and
[1:19:34] she recognized that
[1:19:35] this day the scripture is going to be
[1:19:36] fulfilled
[1:19:40] in other words the scripture is saying
[1:19:43] that messiah is going to come with
[1:19:44] healing in his wings and that's what she
[1:19:46] was after
[1:19:50] now you go back to hebrew again
[1:19:54] and the hebrew word for wings is the
[1:19:57] word kanaf
[1:19:58] yeah but you know that kenneth is not
[1:20:02] does not have just one meaning kenneth
[1:20:05] means
[1:20:06] wings but kenneth means him
[1:20:09] also so if you read the scripture it
[1:20:12] means that
[1:20:13] some of man will rise with healing in
[1:20:16] his head
[1:20:18] this woman knew hebrew she understood
[1:20:22] the scripture he said
[1:20:23] the son of man is going to come with
[1:20:24] healing in his wings of course son of
[1:20:26] man is
[1:20:26] a man in flesh he does not have wings
[1:20:30] no man has wings so she knew how to
[1:20:32] interpret the scripture
[1:20:34] it's not going to be wings on a man but
[1:20:36] it's going to be the ham of his garment
[1:20:40] so she knew scripture she was waiting
[1:20:42] for fulfillment of scripture
[1:20:43] and then she recognized hey hold on this
[1:20:45] is the son of man
[1:20:48] if she didn't recognize that she would
[1:20:49] have went to the high please grab their
[1:20:50] hands
[1:20:51] but she didn't grab their hymns
[1:20:55] so the messiah will come the son of man
[1:20:57] will come with healing in his hands
[1:21:00] she knew the word brothers and sisters
[1:21:03] she found her position in the word yes
[1:21:06] she recognized her day and a message she
[1:21:09] recognized the messiah in her day
[1:21:12] she recognized the word being manifested
[1:21:14] in flesh amen
[1:21:15] what a contrast to everybody else all of
[1:21:18] them saw him they call him bialzebaum
[1:21:20] they call him the son of a soldier they
[1:21:22] call him a devil they call him all sorts
[1:21:24] of name but she recognized that this is
[1:21:26] the son of man this is the messiah
[1:21:29] this is the one with flesh and if i can
[1:21:31] get a hold of his
[1:21:32] hem the scripture of malachi 4 verse 2
[1:21:35] will be fulfilled in my life
[1:21:44] she recognized that day in the message
[1:21:46] and she knew that messiah would come
[1:21:48] with healing in his wings
[1:21:50] and you go back and read the scripture
[1:21:52] the bible says as
[1:21:53] many as grabbed the hole of his hem they
[1:21:55] were healed
[1:21:57] and if we didn't read it we obviously a
[1:21:59] lot of us missed it i missed it i i
[1:22:01] never
[1:22:02] read that scripture took note of it even
[1:22:03] if i read it but the scripture says
[1:22:05] as many as grab the hem of his garment
[1:22:07] we're healed
[1:22:10] so they're not just the one person now
[1:22:12] that had a revelation of who he was
[1:22:14] there were others also that god had
[1:22:16] revealed that this is the messiah
[1:22:17] the word made flesh malachi chapter 4
[1:22:20] verse 2
[1:22:21] was being fulfilled in their days
[1:22:25] you see my point brothers and sisters
[1:22:27] that all through the ages they were
[1:22:29] missing he's coming they were missing
[1:22:30] the way he was unfolding himself
[1:22:32] but look who god was choosing to reveal
[1:22:34] himself woman at the well
[1:22:36] woman with the blood issue martha and so
[1:22:38] forth to them god was
[1:22:40] revealing the mystery of how he unfolded
[1:22:43] himself for the day
[1:22:45] for paul it was grace
[1:22:50] she took a whole of the word and when
[1:22:52] she grabbed the hem of his girl with me
[1:22:54] the the him has the full word of god
[1:22:57] means she grabbed a hold of the word for
[1:22:58] her day
[1:23:00] and she hid herself because she was
[1:23:03] embarrassed she was
[1:23:05] deemed a sinner unclean she was hiding
[1:23:08] but yet she embraced the word
[1:23:12] remember the high priest him he had
[1:23:15] pomegranate with seeds
[1:23:17] the reason why she could identify
[1:23:18] because she had representation there
[1:23:21] she was one of the seeds and the reason
[1:23:23] you recognize this message
[1:23:24] is you are one of those seeds you have
[1:23:27] representation inside of that
[1:23:28] pomegranate
[1:23:29] this morning brothers and sisters the
[1:23:32] pomegranate is
[1:23:41] and she fell and he felt virtue leaving
[1:23:44] him
[1:23:46] in other words virtue left him and
[1:23:48] entered into
[1:23:49] her
[1:23:53] and when the virtue entered into her
[1:23:57] the bible says that her bleeding her
[1:23:59] blood issue stopped amen
[1:24:02] amen
[1:24:06] the unclean was made clean the one that
[1:24:10] was separated from god
[1:24:11] is now brought back into fellowship with
[1:24:13] god amen virtue left him
[1:24:17] and entered into her in other words a
[1:24:19] part of him went into her brothers and
[1:24:21] sisters
[1:24:23] he turned around he said who touched me
[1:24:28] amen hello peter and all of them looking
[1:24:30] around says lord this
[1:24:32] so many people around you how can you
[1:24:34] access who touched you
[1:24:36] says not that cannot touch peter but
[1:24:38] there's a different touch i felt
[1:24:40] virtue leaving me me
[1:24:44] that somebody recognized who i am and
[1:24:46] drew on me drew on the world
[1:24:48] and the word came into her
[1:24:53] say the way he turned to her the bible
[1:24:56] says
[1:24:58] he knew her like he knows you and i
[1:25:02] but all he's waiting for you is for you
[1:25:04] to grab the grab a hold of the word for
[1:25:06] your day
[1:25:07] is for you to understand how scripture
[1:25:09] is being fulfilled in your day
[1:25:11] then he turns to you
[1:25:17] virtue will enter into you
[1:25:20] when you recognize the word for your day
[1:25:22] and it will manifest in you brothers and
[1:25:24] sisters
[1:25:25] expressing god's word for this hour
[1:25:28] she hung on to the hem of the word she
[1:25:31] caught the word because she was part of
[1:25:33] the word
[1:25:34] she was represented by the seeds in the
[1:25:36] pomegranate
[1:25:37] and then the word turned to her
[1:25:40] what did the word do the word revealed
[1:25:44] the mystery of this woman to the rest of
[1:25:46] them
[1:25:47] the lord asks peter who touched me means
[1:25:50] who is this person
[1:25:51] that has got the revelation of the word
[1:25:53] for the hour and peter said
[1:25:55] i don't know who that bride is i don't
[1:25:56] know who that woman is but the word
[1:25:59] turned to the woman and revealed her to
[1:26:01] the others
[1:26:03] this woman was a mystery but the word
[1:26:06] revealed the mystery of who she was
[1:26:09] nobody knew her but when she got the
[1:26:12] mystery of gawa
[1:26:13] then the word revealed her means a word
[1:26:16] revealed her name
[1:26:17] amen
[1:26:20] peter did not recognize her nobody knew
[1:26:22] her
[1:26:23] but when the seal of healing virtue
[1:26:25] broke
[1:26:26] right there it revealed her because her
[1:26:29] name was in the book
[1:26:32] and her name is in the book when you
[1:26:34] read the book of luke
[1:26:36] she's there identified there brothers
[1:26:38] and sisters
[1:26:39] and balaam says your name is in this
[1:26:41] book also amen
[1:26:42] he says it's not like all my neighbor or
[1:26:45] leave or something like that he says
[1:26:47] when the mystery
[1:26:48] from this book is being preached says
[1:26:50] when you catch the mystery he says it
[1:26:52] reveals your name
[1:26:54] in other words she caught the mystery of
[1:26:56] the word for her day
[1:26:58] that this man is malachi and
[1:27:03] world it would foreign who she was amen
[1:27:06] and when you catch the mystery of the
[1:27:07] word for today

[1:27:10] brothers and sisters
[1:27:15] thy faith and made the whole
[1:27:20] the same chapter you find this generous
[1:27:23] daughter

[1:27:38] the bride aid is calling you in this
[1:27:40] chat
[1:27:42] let's close at this point here see
[1:27:47] zechariah chapter 8 verse 22-23
[1:27:50] king james version he says
[1:27:53] many people and strong nations shall
[1:27:55] come to seek the lord of hosts in
[1:27:56] jerusalem
[1:27:58] and to pray before the lord thus saith
[1:28:01] the lord of hosts in those days it shall
[1:28:03] come to pass
[1:28:04] that ten men shall take a whole or ten
[1:28:07] men out of all languages of nations
[1:28:10] even shall take hold of the skirt of him
[1:28:12] that is a jew
[1:28:15] saying we will go with you we have heard
[1:28:18] that god is with you ten men is gonna
[1:28:21] get ahold of one man
[1:28:23] get ahold of his god because they
[1:28:25] believe that god is with this man
[1:28:29] now we know that is christ that all
[1:28:32] nations are going to get a hold of the
[1:28:33] hymn of his girl
[1:28:35] because god is with him he is god
[1:28:38] but in the time today the ten taking a
[1:28:40] hold of the one he's a
[1:28:41] type of revelation chapter 10 verse 1
[1:28:45] means when all nations from all over the
[1:28:47] world is going to recognize revelation
[1:28:49] chapter 10 verse 1
[1:28:52] and grab a hold of his hymn which is the
[1:28:54] word
[1:28:57] take the skirt of one jewish man because
[1:29:00] god is with him that's christ today
[1:29:03] revelation 10 1 and he comes to me with
[1:29:06] an
[1:29:07] open book which is the word itself
[1:29:11] he comes today with an open book which
[1:29:13] is the hymn of his garment
[1:29:15] he comes today with the full word of god
[1:29:17] again
[1:29:21] and he reveals to us brothers and
[1:29:22] sisters that's the gold belt it's a
[1:29:25] pomegranate
[1:29:26] it's a blue castle it represents a deity
[1:29:29] becoming flesh again
[1:29:30] amen revelation 10 with an open book the
[1:29:34] full word
[1:29:34] is coming down to earth again
[1:29:38] the prophet says like i mentioned
[1:29:39] earlier in the book of christ the
[1:29:41] mystery of god revealed he says the
[1:29:42] fullness is back in the church again now
[1:29:44] amen amen
[1:29:46] what does it mean but the fullness is
[1:29:48] back in the church
[1:29:49] because when christ comes to you then
[1:29:51] the fullness is back
[1:29:53] amen because he was the fullness before
[1:29:55] the foundation of the world
[1:29:56] and in that fullness you were
[1:29:58] represented in them amen
[1:30:00] then when you were taken out at calvary
[1:30:01] then it was not the fullness anymore
[1:30:04] because you were taken out the mansion
[1:30:06] but when he comes back
[1:30:07] and he's made flesh in you then the
[1:30:09] fullness is back in the church again
[1:30:11] the two are becoming one
[1:30:18] the fullness back in the church again
[1:30:21] and the angel says to john
[1:30:23] take a hold of that book it means go
[1:30:26] grab his hymn now
[1:30:28] take the full word because your name is
[1:30:31] represented in that book when you grab
[1:30:34] the hell of his garment and you
[1:30:35] recognize your day and your message
[1:30:37] it's going to reveal you as the bride of
[1:30:39] jesus christ today

[1:30:47] faith you believe
[1:30:48] you it is you when you take the book
[1:30:51] when you take the m you are eating the

[1:30:58] entering into you
[1:30:59] when the word is becoming flesh in you
[1:31:03] you recognize your day and its message

[1:31:44] the father and the father is in me
[1:31:46] i am in you and you in me and says this
[1:31:49] day

[1:31:52] being made flesh
[1:31:54] in his pride today is the healing for
[1:31:57] our soul
[1:31:59] grabbing a hold of the hem of this

[1:33:09] blood issue
[1:33:10] or that she hid herself when she
[1:33:12] identified the world because she was so

[1:33:18] wild lord so embarrassed by her
[1:33:20] condition lord she had to come
[1:33:22] at a separate time lord when uh
[1:33:25] when the other woman who were so-called
[1:33:27] uh
[1:33:28] much more holy than her much more
[1:33:30] respected she had to come at a certain
[1:33:32] time

[1:33:35] but yet lord we know that those women
[1:33:37] receive grace and we are so thankful
[1:33:39] that we also feel like that that we

[1:34:52] says the word is a healer
[1:34:53] the word is our savior the word is god
[1:34:55] himself and by the preaching of the word
[1:34:58] about god they could anchor in him
