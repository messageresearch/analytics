TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so this morning we'll speak on a people with vision amen a people with vision will turn to Proverbs 28 and verse 19. [Music] Proverbs 28 and verse 19. [Music] we'll take one portion of the scripture and it says where there is no vision the people perish where there is no vision the people perish may the Lord have blessings from the reading of his word may be seated amen Hallelujah amen with the salvation and his family won't be here this week there won't be a next week they're going to Cape Town amen we test the Lord with bless them and also give them a safe journey back amen so everybody feeling good in the house of the Lord amen hallelujah we are rejoicing night and day as we walk this narrow way amen hallelujah so we see amen for our thoughts having a vision now we can forget everything that has transpired in the past up until this point because we cannot do anything to change the past and if we've been walking without a vision and without a purpose I am praying that the Lord will arrest us this morning the Holy Ghost will make us walk with renewed purpose and a new vision for our lives because God has a plan for our lives amen God knows the purpose for our lives the question is are we walking in his purpose are we walking according to the vision that he has for us amen so our scripture says where there is no vision the people perish so in order for us to be prosperous we need to have a vision so being a person of vision does not mean just having natural sight but the word Vision means revelation amen it means having a dream an idea visualizing something and then we know what the prophetic term of a vision is when God shows a prophet a vision exact events that will transpire now our vision can be bled right our vision cannot be doubled otherwise we will be seeing things but our vision I want to say this morning is the word of God Amen amen it is our sure Foundation amen and it must be the word of God otherwise we will be like a ship without a sail and we will be building upon sinking sand amen so when we say we have people of vision we see things that other people see impossible consider to be impossible we are amen and we are not to be distracted from the vision that we have even though daily we will face negativity we will face criticism we will face Fierce opposition but the vision has been revealed to us amen amen and you have got to believe it with all your heart with all your mind your body your soul and your strength amen when you can believe it like that it will be impossible for the vision to fail amen Hallelujah on our own we have no vision that we can say that we have on our own because when we come to the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says take up your cross and follow him so if a man is saying he's following Jesus and remember what Jesus says he who puts his hand to the plow and turn back he's not worthy for the kingdom of God so we cannot be wondering about buddhari Vision Without a purpose amen without Jesus we have no vision we are destined for help think about our lives without Jesus right now take away Jesus from our lives right now what is our purpose without Jesus we are lost and the only way we can find our vision is to tap into the vision of God and come God's provided way we've got to come to Jesus and he will give us vision for our lives he will give us purpose for our lives yeah amen and not only that he will give us a vision of his word revelation of his word and he will also give us a vision and a passion for his people and for the kingdom of God Amen amen for far too long people have been walking around without a vision without a purpose if I had to question you individually and ask you what is your vision for 2023 please don't be a man that says I don't know we'll see what happens find some time amen and establish a vision and a purpose for your life what is it that you want to do amen let's go to a quote indoors indoors preach 1965. the prophet says here I like a man of vision amen very simple I like a man of vision he says I like people that's got something they fighting for amen amen not just laying around and well whatever comes along will be all right he says oh be up and at it I think every Christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it amen he says find your purpose and go do it he says have a purpose in life something you're going to do God has placed you here do something about it amen now just reading that quote we realize that our Lord Jesus Christ was a man of vision he lived in a world where he was so focused and so driven to the purpose towards to your sins we know that he was about the father's business and Jesus did not become comfortable with the word and allow people friends family to influence him or to shift his vision or his purpose amen he was so determined and he did not lose focus now whenever I'm preaching spiritually you can apply it naturally it will work effectively I guarantee you it'll work these are spiritual laws the Earth is governed by the supernatural amen amen when we can tap into the supernatural spiritual laws of God we will become prosperous in the natural amen amen then the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom seeking first the supernatural seeking first to spiritual amen because the kingdom is not Earthly the kingdom is Supernatural amen so we find Jesus was not just laying around wondering and saying I'll just see what happens at any point in Jesus life when he was a boy whether he was a young man if you asked him he would tell you what his purpose was amen he knew exactly what his purpose was on Earth at 12 years old Mary and Joseph came to him and thinking they had lost him and Jesus shot them by telling them don't you know that I must be about my father's business [Music] so the father's business became his purpose his purpose was his vision and his vision became his passion he became passionate about it that everything Jesus began to say and do was concerning the vision that he had the vision of redemption ugly look even at 30 years old Jesus comes to the prophet John in the water to be baptized and John feeling unworthy says Lord I need to be baptized of you but Jesus knew that the vision and the prophecy must be fulfilled and he told John in Matthew 3 15. it says that Jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness the Bible says then he suffered in amen so what is the Lord Jesus telling John here we've got to fulfill our scripture in a modern age when they tell us does baptism really matter yes it does amen otherwise Jesus would not have commissioned the disciples to go and baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost falling on the day of Pentecost would not be speaking to Peter and tell him repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins amen we do not need to intellectualize it we do not need to say oh it doesn't really matter we must fulfill our scripture amen so Jesus did not accept circumstances you don't accept just any circumstance that comes into your life anything that never presents you do not accept it amen yes amen do not be coming so you know some people are so accommodating don't accommodate the devil don't accommodate his schemes the devil is out to destroy your vision yes amen Hallelujah think of our lovely Lord Jesus now amen yeah he's walking the Earth as a man and he does not accept any circumstance that comes his way amen and if you are associated with Jesus neither should you amen because Mary in her association with Jesus did not want to accept the situation that there was he had run out of wine it wasn't Jesus that asked for what to be to be turned into wine it was Mary it was Mary's desire in fact it was Mary's vision that Jesus was going to turn things around amen amen so if you are if you are associated with Jesus amen that's just him amen yes amen don't just leave him sitting there while there's no wine while there's no stimulation of Revelation amen activate the gift and say Amen Jesus they have run out of wine and even if the answer is negative pursue the cause Mary told us people do whatsoever Jesus tells you to do amen Hallelujah the man who died his friends refused to accept that he was dead Jesus was preaching in a house there was no way to enter the house so these men took off the roof they refused to accept the circumstance amen amen and they lowered the man into the presence of Jesus amen at all costs get to Jesus Amen in all situations get to Jesus amen Hallelujah this man the Lord Jesus Christ was so full of power so full of the anointing his eye was so fixed on the vision that was given to him amen amen and one day he came into the temple and he took the book and he told him exactly what the vision was amen amen prophecy had been fulfilled but he was not referring back to a zionine prophecy he was not referring to other prophecies amen a voice crying in the wilderness he was referring to our present tense prophecy yes amen amen he was showing them what Jesus is doing now present tense I hope we're learning this morning amen amen when people are wondering what is God doing is God silent take them to the World open them up to scripture in Revelation 10 is our scripture Our present-day reality show them what God is doing in 2023 amen amen Hallelujah Jesus opens up the scripture and he says the spirit of the Lord God is upon me yes can you say that this morning amen amen can you say that we're not a shed off a doubt that the spirit of the Lord God is upon us yes well it ought to be amen we ought to be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen because the Lord God had anointed me you can pick this up in his eyes 61 and verse 1. let's see what our lord Jesus is saying the Lord had anointed me amen we're learning now we must be anointed Amen to preach Good Tidings unto the meek so no problem when people don't want to preach they have not been anointed to preach amen you know there's a movement going on saying Don't Preach they're not anointed to preach amen but if you have been anointed to preach Good Tidings into the meek then you must fulfill that vision you must fulfill that purpose he had sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of prison to them that are bound amen to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord what is the acceptable year of the Lord it is the Year of Jubilee where you can go free as Sons and Daughters we are free he of the son of man is set free he's free indeed amen we are no longer bound by tradition of man we are no longer bound by denominational ideas man made religion amen but we have been set free and liberated by God almighty amen hallelujah he says and now this is the part Jesus cut it off there in the middle of that sentence when he said to proclaim the acceptable here of the Lord but now that he has come inside of man ministry again he's come to activate the second part of that prophecy amen many many men that's what Revelation 10 is all about amen this Mighty angel coming down with vengeance he says and the day of Vengeance about God took Comfort all that more to a point unto them that morning Zion to give unto them beautiful ashes this is the season where God is turning Beauty amen for ashes your situation may have been burnt to ashes but God is going to turn into a thing of beauty amen this is the season where the oil of joy for mourning the garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called Trees of Righteousness amen amen are you a tree of righteousness this morning the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified amen what is it the Christ in me the hope of glory amen I tell you Jesus was so anointed Jesus did not accept any circumstance if you came to him blind you went away with perfect eyesight if you came to him sick you went back healed amen if you came to him purple you went back walking Amen to see the Lord God Almighty the one that he still has the same power this morning amen amen if he came to him a leper he went back lens if you came to him condemned like that woman was caught in the act of adultery you went Unforgiven set free without your accused of accusing you amen hallelujah if you were dead and he brought you to Jesus you were resurrected back to life amen amen in his presence this morning if your branch is withered away if your desire and your vision has withered away in the presence of Jesus you are going to be resurrected this morning amen God has called you into this church for a purpose amen God has called you here for a reason having step into the vision this morning don't just be a late remember amen become involved in the things of God commit yourself to the things of God man amen yes Hallelujah don't you want to walk in prosperity this morning walking spiritual Prosperity tapped into the vision of God for your life [Music] amen hallelujah this is the mighty God we are talking about we change all circumstances this was the god man hallelujah amen and if he's coming to your tomb this morning I'm praying that you will be resurrected back to life maybe it is your desire for serving the lord has died maybe your passion for serving the lord has died but this morning may you experience a resurrection amen Hallelujah even when he was dead in the flesh and he was amen he was still fulfilling the vision of God he said destroy this Temple any three days I will raise it up again amen he was not resting in the grave but Jesus was still fulfilling the commission he had a Ministry beyond the grave and he stepped into his teeth in his body and he began to preach the soul that I imprisoned amen amen hallelujah hallelujah he went back and he spoke to them and he told them about the Redeemer that had come upon the face of the Earth and even though they they still had no amen salvation he still wanted them to hear the gospel amen amen amen he wins amen and he preached in the region of the Lost he preached to Saul that I in prison amen and then he went and he entered out paradise amen so powerful was this Lord Jesus that Amen on the third day amen he rose up triumphantly from the grave amen because why the spirit of God raised him up yes and if that's in spirit that raised Jesus from the dead to help in you it will also Quicken your moral body it'll Quicken the moral body of the river the sleeping Saints amen because Jesus on the cross he cried with a loud voice and the Bible says when he resurrected amen many of the Old Testament Saints resurrected with him yes amen amen so to sum it up you cannot come into the presence of Jesus and leave the same amen you've got the prophet say that many times you will either live better or you live in a worse of condition think of the Richmond ruler did he live in a better condition or a worse off condition yeah amen so not everyone who comes into the prince of Jesus it's you got to do your part and step into the vision Jesus detailed what he needed to do he needed a vision of how do I get eternal life and Jesus outlined it for him oh yes all he had to do was follow it but he rejected that vision and purpose that God had for his life amen we sing that song don't lose your vision of Jesus and keep your eyes [Music] many friends and your loved ones I've lost their ways and they have lost their vision of him amen so my question to you this morning how is your vision is it getting blurry do you have 20 20 eyesight spiritually everyone was waiting for 2020 it was going to be a major celebration but 2020 changed the entire Earth we are still feeling the effects of it Global economies are crashing can you discern the times and the seasons that we are living in this age is prophesied to be blind the eye to the age is the prophet yes he's the Seer after the eye comes the mind and we know the bride is the mind of Christ but in order for us to receive the mind of Christ there had to be an eye to the age and to reject the prophet of the ages to walk blindly in lead us here the Bible prophesies that gross Darkness would cover the people but we know that is 60 says that a great light has Shone for the believer let's turn to Azad Hosea the book of Isaiah 4 and verse 6. people are being destroyed in this hour because they have no vision people are going to church they are religious people then have you believed that they are Christians but Isaiah 4 and 6 says my people are destroyed for the latter of what knowledge yes my people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge I can say they are destroyed for the lack of having a vision of what God wants for their lives I can say they are destroyed because they have no purpose for their lives hmm which denomination can you go to and tell me show me what God is doing now in 2023 according to the scripture not what your false prophet is saying hmm because right now the first sermon on a Sunday they'll be prophesying I prophesy prosperity and blessings over you this is your year this is your season tap into the supernatural connect with me partner with me so we see and you know what the people Faithfully do it but here we are in a message and we don't do things some people that we were more faithful to the waiter and gave him 10 percent than God religiously you even get upset with the wife or the white kid upset with the husband to give him 10 percent you're so religious about giving away to ten percent but when God asks you for ten percent you ignored him amen amen my people perish because of the lack of knowledge now knowledge can come to you but you must have an ear to hear right now you could be turning away the gospel the Bible says he's at Athen here let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church let's turn to other kid 2 and verse 3. 2 and verse 2. now if I'm talking spiritual principles because when God had a vision for us what did the prophecy everything is in the word amen amen can I get a better amen than that everything concerning the Plan of Redemption is in the word now he first had it in his first Bible then he moved it to the second Bible the pyramids now it's in the written word so can I say that the Bible is the vision and the purpose of God in what form do you have it this morning in written form so did God write the vision somebody worked with me this morning amen did God write the vision yes amen and apply that physically I'm going to bring this down practically to you because I've seen it work right division don't just ask God for a thing and be haphazard about it let me read first and I'll detail what I'm telling you and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables make it plain some of you are writing like a 17 mystery back to God a silence day God wants you to ask of him and be specific he says that he may run that readeth it what does that mean whoever is meeting him may go forth and fulfill what's written he says for the vision is yet point a point in time but at the end it shall speak amen and not lie though it Terry wait for it that's the problem we humans have now the waiting period very quickly I tell you you remember the man who came into the prayer line you know the story about the blind man right but there is another story of another man he came back into the prayer line he will add like a shaking thing and you had like you know and he came back and he said I'm still got this the prophet says didn't I tell you you are healed already he says go back and confess it the man went back to his country and he's always whichever City he lived and he began to confess it and confess it his mother became so ashamed and said but he keeps speaking things and the people are making fun of him until one day he said it and his body stopped shaking amen now two to the vision amen amen he spoke with a Ponder of confession I don't care if you're from now for the next five years holy positive confession that you were healed amen it's right he says go eat Harry wait for it now if you're asking God for a job what job do you want what do you want to do you don't even know what you want to do but God says go till the ground in that day there was only one form maybe it was farming they had to live up the produce of the earth now we're still living off the Earth whether it's construction Metals whatever it is it's all taken from the earth man is still till the ground everything that you see physically with your eye was taken from the earth namely one thing that wasn't taken from the Earth when man just spoke and it happened and here the microphone appears everything was taken from the Earth it was a seed planted in the Earth a tree grew somebody cut the tree down amen if you are asking God for your wife describe the wife you want write the vision let me go back and and reiterate this I want everybody to go back and write down what is it that you desire of the Lord and put it in a place where you see it every single day because sometimes you even forget and you don't have faith to believe what you ask the Lord you go away you ask now and then you forget about it recognition you want a house how many bedroom house do you want yes do you want a pool what do you want oh you see right now people are not believing my God owns a kettle on a thousand years your small desire you know you want a house you want a house maybe the best areas these days I don't know maybe ballito Durban North maybe umhlanga God is laughing at you and he's saying look at these people they think that's the best because in our minds that's the best but no I have seen no years heard the things that God has in store for us write it down how many of you follow what I'm saying I don't know if you will follow what I am saying and do what I am saying write down the vision if you are sick write it down I am healed put the date that you're confessing it if you want to say I am healed two thousand years ago put it there and I don't want you to ever speak another word of negativity over that situation yes I don't give your close family member and they know that you don't have one leg every time they see you must tell them I'm walking perfectly I have two legs I'm giving an extreme case because I want you to understand what I am saying I am perfectly well I am perfectly healed find the quote God heals through music God heals through doctors I am trying to bring a practical gospel to you so write it down tell the Lord I want a message called I want a message boy I want her to have long hair I wanted to have a Meek and a quiet spirit I wanted to tell the Lord what you desire amen if you if you find it just let me know amen Allah the spirit has brought that to my remembrance I want to amen God heals music God heals through love you know the quote amen so remember what we are speaking about now this morning a people with vision so let's just read from there he says there's nothing like music you know God heals my music did you know that God heals my music now now if we know that might be listening to music Good gospel music now listen the prophet is detailing how God heals will we make it only one way I need to come in the front I need to pass to lay his hands on me and that's it he's telling you God heals my music are you listening to good music are you listening to songs of faith God heals my music listen to the right kind of music because we do not know which way God will choose to heal you amen amen let's change our ways this year God heals my medicine sorry I'll never go to the doctrine God used my medicine is this your Prophet speaking God heals my medicine sometimes you will use the doctors to form their operation to save your life because if you do not have a quadruple bypass you will be dead so God uses the doctors and medicine to give you a bypass you believe God heals my medicine so God he is my medicine and with that now God heals by medicine there are other forms of therapy that God can heal you about because it's all associated with medicine I'm not talking psychology now right God heals by prayer this is the one all of us are familiar with God heals by prayer God has many ways of healing depends on what type that you need sometimes a little love oh sometimes we need love hello yo I'm talking to robots here sometimes we just need a little bit of love to bring the healing when we are down somebody just offers you a bit of life and love can come in many forms many ways you can show love one to another didn't Jesus say let your light shows shine before men now I want you to know what the light is because he's defining a journal that they might see your good what works so he's defining your life to be your works and he says they might see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so we are to express love we can express love when someone is down depressed go to them buy them their favorite meal take them out talk to them encourage them play them their favorite song remind them amen pick them up in the spirit I'm sorry this is too practical for some of us this morning but I am a shepherd amen and sheep I'm dealing with sheep and I'm dealing with Lambs amen I'm not an evangelist to come here this morning I am not a prophet to come here this morning neither am I an apostle neither am I a teacher here this morning but I am a pastor so you'll find the message very pastoral this morning because I've got to tap into my anointing and my gifting as well amen and sometimes it may not be the common thing that's being preached but I'm taking a quote and I'm stripping it down for you amen that God he has many ways of healing yes amen amen look at what he says sometimes they love stretched out who just cure an old sore an old place that's gradually you know when somebody hurts you they spoke bad words against you and you've got that little feeling inside there and nobody knows what I'm talking about you know every time you see that person even though you love them and you still the feeling is still there even though you say you made it right to that person you can't really say a good word about that person but you need a little love to heal that thing he says Italy it'll heal right over just a little love a little kid amen now here's our spiritual prophet did he say anything about the word then they say anything else about fasting praying this step what did he say sometimes we need a little love okay sometimes when you feel all down as we call it a street expression down in the dumps see just put on one of those tapes that music or your record and go to playing it the first thing you know you'll be petting your foot or your hand and it's all over there you're right up and ready to go again amen you see so God has many ways of dealing with you this year and in the years to come amen the reason why I'm emphasizing this year we're not sure if this is the year that we will go away from the Earth I can't focus too much on the future I got to focus on what God is doing now amen because tomorrow is not promised to us right now is what we have let's make the best of it amen so to reiterate our lord Jesus was a man of vision and so should his wife be a woman of vision he lived in a world where he was so focused and driven to accomplish the purpose for which we have sent now never allow people because Jesus never allowed the world all our people the friends to influence him right never allow that to happen to you we were going on appointed we read Amos no so we read Hosea 4 6 he says my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge right then you name us eight and eleven it says behold the days come and save the Lord God I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread no I thirst of water but of hearing the words of the Lord amen amen amen so what is he telling us there's going to be a time in famine where there's going to be no vision in the land yeah the word of the Lord there's going to be a famine for it so how are we going to get this Revelation how are we going to get spiritual food in due season let's go to Romans 10 and 13. we're just trying to follow a sequence of events here first people are destroyed by lack of knowledge then the Lord is sending a famine not a bread of water but the word of the Lord which is his vision in Romans 10 and verse 13 it says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved but then he goes on to elaborate and he says how shall they call on him on whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and now shall they hear without a preacher yes amen so there's a fair man in the land but the people in order to receive spiritual food need a preacher yes he says how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring the Glad Tidings of good things then we know that the preacher is depending on the Lord and here is our key and we said the prophet is the eye to the age you're all familiar with the scripture Revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God the spiritual vision of God the spiritual things of God should be finished as he has declared to his servant the prophet how many of you know the other song I can't even walk without you holding my hand the Mountain's too high and The Valleys too wide and down on my knees I've learned to stand I can't even walk without you holding my hair amen amen I'm gonna try and bring this to a close now your attitude will determine the vision for your life your attitude towards God and the things of God will determine how spiritually successful you are in him right now and for the rest of 2023 and for the rest of the time that the Lord is here for the Gentile dispensation I'll say it again we are in the closing scenes of the Gentile dispensation when you're reading Acts chapter 2 it's the start it's the alpha age of the Holy Ghost Ministry we are living now in 2023 it's the closing scenes of the Holy Ghost Ministry to the Gentiles amen your attitude will determine the type of year it's going to be for you if you're full of faith and positive I'm going to tell you you're going to have a supernatural here amen it's impossible for you not to have a supernatural here if you're full of faith [Music] not only are you going to have a supernatural here the year is going to be full of Supernatural experiences amen we believe the angel of God is here yes the angel of God is a supernatural being then we must have Supernatural experiences amen allow the Holy Ghost to lead us and guide us into all truth because that's what the Holy Ghost was sent for yes amen my advice to you never make decisions that go against the word of God rather take the word of God over everything if it's contrary to the word of God leave it alone God is compromising and weak faith reasoning weakens the faith of a believer and can never bring the promise of God to pass in your life now we know that Satan thrives in reasoning in doubt don't let Satan deposit re EF amen so faith is a positive confession hold that confession before the Lord amen hold it as if you are holding his sign of your belief that God is more than able to bring it to pass amen the prophet says today you might pick this up brother amen in the message inspiration don't we all need some inspiration you know what the prophet is saying in the message inspiration page 28th of January 1956 he says today the reason we're having such times as we are is because there's too much halfway conversations intellectual conversation there is two different elements in the human body that has a mind and one of them or reasoning one of them the reasoning is the mind which is intellectual the other is the soul which does not reason but believes the word of God he says you know some time ago fans laughed at the as a man thinketh in his heart so is he he said they said the Bible's all mixed up because man there's no mental faculties in the heart to think with but last year science proved that God was right they found right down in the heart of a man not in an animal but in a man there's a little compartment where even the blood cell doesn't even exist and they say it's the occupant of the soul that man by his soul lives there oh amen paragraph 23 he says now each of you have had experiences today think to say it can't happen now what is this he's saying people are going to come to you and tell you that it can't be whatever you're believing the Lord for it can't be it's not going to come to pass he's saying each of you about experiences where somebody say it can't happen it won't be but something right down in your soul that tells you it's going to be amen amen yes it doesn't make any difference what anybody says around unreasonable it seems to be you seem to know that it's going to be that way I mean if you're first in the law for that job is going to give it to you if you can believe your heart no matter the odds are stacked up against you you are going to receive it it's because your soul has testified and reasonings has been cast down as the Bible said it should now we said attitude right we can go into that quite a bit your attitude you know the saying your attitude will determine your altitude our you can go with God so attitude think on that I don't have time to elaborate the next thing influence yeah watch who we allow to influence us going forward yeah From This Moment On never allow negative people to influence you get away from negative people it's always about a negative thought negative idea casting the negative influence on you now it's easy to say customary negative people right but follow my thought if the mother and father is negative it's hard right especially if you're the sun because you don't really want to admit that your father is negative all the time and your mother is negative and always criticizing people and bringing them down am I talking sense reality but can we self-evaluate and say am I surrounded by negative people because you're fine it means lead that way to fall right and you know what they say something about nothing not falling far from the tree the Apple doesn't fall far from the tree if you are surrounded by a negative environment you're always hearing your father and your mother talk negative what kind of fruit do you think you're going to produce full of faith and positive you know what you're going to do you're also going to speak negative because that's the influence but why I brought it down to the home that's the most influential area of your life you spend the most time there now we can take you to the workplace we can take you to your school you can take you to your college don't allow me I'm summarizing and saying don't allow negative people to influence you right amen don't allow the world to influence you and I'm talking when I'm saying the world it can be extend to family whether the Christian denominational people don't allow them to influence you their standards are not missing standards their ways are not our ways neither are their ways God's ways amen okay I don't want to elaborate too much of that now don't we said one thing don't allow people to influence you right but don't allow I'm trying to retake it a little deeper now sometimes you get into relationships with people where you can get influenced because as young people growing up it's common it's natural for you to be attracted towards a girl and a girl towards a boy that's the only way we have it here a girl towards a boy and a boy towards a girl right we don't believe boys like boys and girls like girls we don't believe that I've got to say because they're teaching the schools things these I mean the children in schools these days that it's okay for boys to like boys it's okay for girls to like girls it's not okay amen you will tell your teacher I said that bring me to the principal's office amen if we do not influence our children they are teaching it in schools gender-neutral things you might meet a young lady this year and you can what am I trying to say let me summarize what I'm trying to say you are going to meet people where you're going to allow your heart to become involved and once matters of the heart are involved it's difficult so what am I saying guard your heart is here amen amen you may be praying Lord I need to meet the right woman I need to be meet the right man amen you may make people lose your friend at work people at school always remember you are a Christian and what you stand for when it comes to the word of God when it comes to the matters of the heart God your heart and do not allow yourself to get into a situation where you forsake the word of the Lord to settle for an unbeliever not going to elaborate this because you young men need to stop it if you are not of the age to get married stop flirting with that girl um you must be of the right age you might be able to say well I don't believe in casual dating amen amen don't be chatting up girls don't be chatting our boys for the sake of it if you are not able and ready to get married stop it focus on other things in your life you say focus on what how about get a job foreign how are you going to take care of your family how are you going to take care of the wife amen ready to get married meaning you are mature you're a man you have a job you can take care of the household take out the responsibilities of having a wife being a provider and also being the most importantly being the spiritual leader of home amen all the time women get into marriages and they find out there's many soon non-spiritual they think he went in the room to pray meanwhile they go there and he's playing TV games hey so guard your heart because I'm saying that because it's difficult when you get entangled and you fall so in love with that person and now your heart dictates to you more than the word of God so watch the relationships that we get involved with in all areas I have to close now and I want you all now to go out of this meeting believing that all things are possible I say you will neither be Barren nor unfruitful and your fruit will remain if you abide in the word of God amen you're free to remain your vision will be focused and specific your vision will influence others now you're not just influenced by others your vision will influence others amen and we must share the gospel this year who's with me we must share the gospel and tell everyone we come in contact with what the Lord Jesus is doing in this time and in this season we must be passionate about the gospel we cannot be casual we must not be casually in fact we must be sold out from the cause of the Gospel this year let us be a people with vision how many of you agree with me amen how many of you say Lord if I if I haven't given you my best in the last year or so you get I guarantee you if you were really in inspect your life you'll know if you're being going further towards God or you've been backsliding you know if you've been giving more to God or less to God and let's be honest people here this morning yes yes we want to step into the vision that God has for our lives be a people with vision then you'll understand what Revelation 10 11 says Thou must prophesy again amen I am so blessed I'm just reading what other apostles were acting in the book of Acts and I tell you they are so powerful men the angel of the Lord appearing and just leading them and guiding them and you watch these sermons they preach powerful sermons and if we can depend on the team Holy Ghost that's here I'm believing he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think because now we have the fullness of the world and he's going to do it for us that's my vision for the church that we be a people of vision amen we be a people of purpose don't just be casual and say oh we're in the message no let's shake ourselves let's shake things up amen let's walk and talk to some God and the Lord will bless us amen and let's put our shoulders to the wheel let's walk with one common Vision with one common purpose with one common goal amen that we might bring a soul into the kingdom of God that we can take in physical changing of the bodies and go into rapture amen hallelujah I want you to stand now give the Lord a good income of Praise amen dear people of vision be on top he like each and every one of you might have a different desire and a different vision for your life we know what's God's vision for our lives right but God has left the daily running of your lives the prophet says if you want to study go and study the prophet said if you need to find a wife go and find a wife he says the only person that wasn't given that opportunity was Adam right so stop sitting in your house and expecting the CEO from the company to come knock on your door I'd say I heard you're looking for a job because faith without words is dead get your CV done if you need to study something when studying you need to empower yourself go and Empower yourself and sow your seed that's your works and accompanied with your prayer God is able to open up the door amen Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and I saw a moment now you just bow your head in prayer you know right now my
