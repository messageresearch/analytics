amen brother jeffrey preached wednesday service amen the wednesday service he continued on the same thought amen and he told us not to take not to presume with the earnest of our inheritance amen hallelujah then wednesday we spoke on the redeemed sons and daughters of god and this morning we'll speak on the sound of the redeemed the redeemed away sound amen the redeemed have a point of access to the lord amen so let's turn to psalm 149 we go to the chief psalmist david amen psalm 149 and verse 1 says praise he the lord sing unto the lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of the saints that's what we've just been doing amen in the congregation of the saints let israel rejoice in him that made him what is he saying worship him as creator let israel rejoice in him that made him not only as creator now let the children of zion be joyful in their king amen he's our creator he's our king let them praise his name in the dance some of us are lacking in that amen but praise him in the dance amen let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and the heart for the lord taketh pleasure in his people amen the lord takes pleasure in our worship he will beautify the meek with salvation for the lord take it okay so we read that let the saints be joyful in glory amen let them sing aloud upon their beards yes let them wander upon their beds let them sing aloud upon their beds let the high praises of god be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand amen even in your bed you got the praises of god in your mouth the word of the lord in your hand amen because the devil might come to attack you in the night time amen now watch follow a strain of thought now the one the redeemed that's got the high praises of god in their mouth and the two-edged sword in the hand they're going to use it let's see what they're using it for to execute vengeance upon the eden look at what praise does and punishments upon the people to bind up their kings with chains these are not earthly kings but these are supernatural demons that come to torment us you binding them up with chains and their nobles these small little demons with fetals of iron to execute upon them judgment written this honor and all the saints this is the honor given to the saints praise he the amen hallelujah how many of you know david was writing in prophecy amen amen john 4 23 this is the discourse between the lord and the woman at the well we're just going to pick it up from verse 23 where jesus is telling her the hour cometh and now is now jesus mentioned that 2000 years ago but i'm saying the hour now is when true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth amen let's go to the lord in prayer father we thank you lord for the victory that we have in your presence oh god we thank you for the overcoming power that you have given us this morning father even as we come into your house this morning and lord we come to this part of the service oh god where lord we will hear your word and we know that faith cometh by the hearing of the word and father i pray lord that the word will come now and lord put us in our place lord where we should be in our praise and our worship towards you oh god and father we may you establish us in this area of our life oh god so that we can have overcoming power that you have given us lord jesus we commit to hear o lord we commit lord myself before we come as both your emotional god another outpouring of your spirit lord and i pray you'll meet us at the point of our need we commit the servants into your hands and father pray you'll heal the sick now father lord lift them up out of the condition of god so father they'll be able to hear the word of the lord this morning we ask his blessings and we love you we say lord come now our hearts we ask his blessings in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen you may be seated amen so i'd like you to invite you this morning if you had plans this morning i want you to cancel your plans to be miserable some of us maybe have plans to come into the house of the lord and just be miserable but cancel those plans amen cancel those plans to be sad this morning cancel your plans amen to not be involved in the service this morning cancel your plans i'll just go and hear what they're going to see this morning amen but get involved with the service how many of you know you know when you're watching anything on a television you got a remote and you are able to operate the gift there might be 50 channels but you've got the remote to operate those 50 channels who operates the gift behind the purpose amen amen come on now who operates the gift behind the pulpit so if you got a knee this morning and you're going to tell the lord lord i need to go to acts 238 you operated there on your channel on your remote amen and the lord can transmit it to the minister and you operate the gift amen but you got to say in amen when you're operating the gift amen hallelujah hallelujah we ought to be happy in the house of the lord amen the children of god are joyful in the house of the lord amen amen so the sound of the redeemed redeemed now i'm not talking about just any person that's giving praise and worship i am talking about the sound of the redeemed sons and daughters of god amen them that are filled with the holy ghost this is what this is directed to or who it is directed to our point of this morning message is not to insult somebody else we may contrast it but it's not to insult anyone or to tear anybody else's worship down we are trying to focus on the redeemed as a sound that is pleasing to the hear of the lord because the bible says that the father is seeking this kind of worship is not flowing out in abundance yes but it says the father is seeking their worship in spirit and in truth amen truth only came at the end time the outpouring of the holy ghost in its fullness only came in the end time so now is the time when true worshipers can worship in spirit and in truth now how do we we describe this worship this praise to the lord this kind of access that we have to this dimension praise and worship is an excess that we have that opens up the access to the heavenly realm which is the supernatural world we can be seated here this morning in a three-dimensional world and without a rocket ship without a space suit our voice can travel and reach the highest of heavens now just to put into context what we just did for the younger people they may be thinking why do we go to church and just sing our voices are we going from here and it's reaching the heavens where god is amen it's reaching the highest of heavens this worship is not going to the sixth dimension it is not directed to the sixth dimension this worship is directed to the seventh dimension where god is amen now god is an object of worship so we must worship him so without anything we can transcend this three-dimensional world and enter our voice can enter that seventh dimension amen amen now heaven loves it when we worship america but at the same time there are two things happening while heaven is loving the sound of our worship the sound of the redeemed hell is being tormented you want to torment the devil stop praising the lord amen if you're sick i'm if you're sick and tired of the devil how many of you are sick and tired of demon powers amen stop praising the lord amen when people begin to call in the name of the lord he cannot operate in the atmosphere of faith amen even if the person may have been possessed with a demon when he starts to praise the lord and he starts to sing the hallelujahs that demon spirit leaves him amen amen so when we begin to call on the name of the lord and we make a positive confession he is defeated satan and his demon powers are defeated he is powerless when we use the name of the lord jesus because just the mention of jesus demons bow at that name amen he has to flee he hates it so much that he has to flee amen amen this kind of sound that is coming out of the redeem annihilates the enemy in an atomic warfare it's like atomic bombs blasting the kingdom of hell but in the eyes of god it's beautiful sounds of worship coming into heaven amen one sound yes but two different amen end to it one is going into the eternal realm and glorifying the name of the lord and the other one is sending bombs to hell amen with one action hallelujah now what does praise i don't know if you know what a force field is ask autumn what a force field is she's always telling me about a force field i didn't even know what a force field is hey man if you know what a force field is it's a field maybe brother caleb might be able to describe this much better with his electronic knowledge amen electricity it's a force field right something like that but nothing can enter you praise and worship is a force field around you amen amen hallelujah now we have got to okay we'll go into it slowly because the false feel is only activated through faith amen yes all right now when you praise the lord according to god's word which we believe we are doing according to his word you can expect your enemy to fall this morning let's turn to psalm 98 and verse 4 we'll just go through a few scriptures now the bible says make a joyful sound a joyful noise amen people may be wondering why you're making a noise but we are making a joyful noise amen yeah what king david is saying here make a joyful noise unto the lord all the earth make a small noise am i reading it right okay make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise sing to the lord with the heart and with the voice of islam with trumpets and the sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the lord the king now listen to the next verse watch how the sea roars is it a small voice the raw of the ocean he says let me see raw amen every time you go to the ocean and hear it roaring they are worshiping the lord because they are fulfilling their purpose and the fullness they of the world and they that dwell therein oh even the floods that came it says let the floods clap their hands [Music] just the rush of that water in the floods is fulfilling god's purpose let the heroes be joyful together before the lord for he cometh to judge the earth with righteousness shall he judge the world and the people with equity amen now how if you know that your vocal cords your voice is a vibration there's a vibration taking place in your vocal cords and it's producing a sound so what is a shout now we're not talking about the three stages of the rapture right now i'm asking you what is a shout because some of you are going to tell me it's a message going forth to gather the living saints because you're so well taught in what the shout is but i'm asking you what is a shout it's the loudest sound a person can make amen when a baby cries at the top of his voice it gets attention according to the baby it's shouting amen and the mother responds to the cry of the baby it's a loud cry [Music] the shout when somebody is in need of help they say hell nobody's gonna hear them when somebody's in a desperate need for help they're screaming help amen amen they want to get somebody's attention i know some of you thinking i'm waking up from your sleep this morning no time to sleep this morning in the house of the lord amen amen [Music] some of us getting settled in our chair and now the spas is shouting here amen a shout is a loud noise but that's what the bible is saying shout to the lord amen when somebody's in need of help they don't whisper they shout they cry out for help now when a lion roars why is he roaring and lying in his in the terms of a shout he is shouting he is roaring what is he doing his voice thunders through the forest through the jungle that voice rips through every tree it establishes his territory with his shout he's telling them i am the king of the jungle amen to that shout he is controlling and he's telling everyone that i am the master of this territory now when god created adam what did he tell him have dominion over the earth amen through the rule of dominion when man shouts it establishes his territory that we are supposed to be controlling the realm of the spirit world amen man is far superior than a lion so we he cry his praise and his worship is establishing dominion over his territory the shout represents the core of one's energy it's not a stifled cry but when you shout you are shouting from the core the call of your strength now you cannot praise the lord without getting your five senses involved amen right when the spirit man is truly don't be like i'm worshiping in my spirit now no the spirit man activates the five senses then we shout shout using the vocal cords then we lift our hands then we dance amen we jump hallelujah amen we cannot praise the lord without using our human emotions the life energy force that takes dominion amen the life energy force comes out from within us and takes to minion and whoever is hearing the shout it changes the atmosphere all the other animals go quiet in the jungle because they're lying at work yes even when it's a shock for help doesn't it change the atmosphere you get concerned who's shouting for help it changes the atmosphere but can you imagine when we shout unto god how it changes the atmosphere amen amen that is why religion does not want you to shout religion thrives on bondage how many of you know dead men don't shout neither do dead christians amen and now if you know the closer you get to dying the smaller the sound you make think about that it ends up in a whisper the person what did he say with his last breath you have to go near him what did he say so the closer you get to dying the sound becomes smaller psalm 115 verse 17 psalm 115 17 amen listen what david says the dead do not praise the lord nor do any who go down into silence can you see the ones who don't praise the lord that's the only one excluded the dead do not praise the lord neither do any that go down in silence so while we have our breath amen the redeemed has a sound amen amen now if you go to a game i know lots of people in this church love soccer i'm not gonna blast you this morning about soccer but i'm gonna use it this morning as an example okay if you go to the to a game of soccer and your team scores the fans go hysterical do i have everyone's attention amen do i have everyone's attention amen god is greater than liverpool because he's in a league of his own amen god is greater than liverpool he's in his own league amen he's higher than the highest greater than the greatest now got your attention now if you go to a ball game and the team scores they in the stadium they erupt shouts of joy they hug one another up and down hey they blow their trumpet their vazelas this madness hysteria the soccer players jump on one another 10 guys going through one guy have you seen that nobody okay just go onto youtube if you don't watch soccer and you'll see it i know some of you don't watch you see they go hysterical they go ballistic shouting but you know not everyone in the stadium is shouting the spectate there's a spectator in that audience and he doesn't support any side he's just a spectator so he's not moved he's just there to watch the game maybe to please a boyfriend or a husband she's not interested in soccer she just attended the match so she is not moved she's a spectator she's looking at alpha jumping up and down like a crazy man right so just like that spectators in god's arena just hold their hands just sit down and are not involved in the sound of the redeemed now it's not only happening there in the stadium if the game is live in your house things are getting thrown people go switch off the tv people kick things they shout at one another in the something that is happening thousands of miles across the world creates an emotional reaction within you if you could you would even slap that person sitting next to you because he's mocking you now that's the anger that builds up inside of you anyone can relate you know what i'm saying it's happening there but it's creating an atmosphere change in your house that's how it falls people up now i just showed you the two worlds so think of how this is now our worship is connecting to heaven amen liverpool is playing manchester united there in i don't know the names of their stadiums but they're playing it there but you are affected in your house not only you but in every bar room in every home people are going crazy now the bigger the play this is not just to do a soccer now but let's let's take it in terms of soccer if the goal is more difficult to score the greater the sound am i right if it was an easy goal it's probably not that but when it's a fantastic goal say messi i know some of you don't like myths say ronaldo whoever you like you're scoring and he curves that ball the greater the play the greater the sound of the applause amen think about it when the team is down beyond points and they come at the last the whistle is blowing and they score how does that stadium erupt amen the bigger the play the greater the shout out now god has made his biggest play yet at the end time god has made his biggest move yeah the end time how much more the [Music] amen i i just want to mention this i'm talking about you this morning because i'm see some people still not getting involved they thought i'm talking about somebody else this morning i'm talking about us yeah this church we need to get involved praise the lord amen now if we do not get physically involved in the worship service in the praising and even in the preaching by saying amen and hallelujah and thank you jesus amen then we are just expecting the service we never clap we never shout we never sing we never get involved we never testify amen we never ever get involved we come in defeated and we go out defeated amen but the person you can line up deuteronomy 28 and verse 6 but a person who understands the value of praise and worship under understands what it is to come with the sound of the regime now remember my thought is it must come from the innermost being it must be the sound of the regime then you'll be blessed coming in here's the scripture and you'll be blessed going out blessed shall thou be when thou come again oh you're blessed i'm rejoicing night and day amen as i walk the snare away and you'll be blessed when you're going out our hearts burn within us had you spoke along the way bless you'll be coming in and bless your be going out amen amen hallelujah we understand that heaven responds to a certain sound even responds to the sound of the redeemed that is worshiping in spirit and in truth now the person playing an instrument this guitar cannot play itself that note that you are hearing it is coming from the depths of that musician he wants to express that certain note or when a trumpet is being blown the one that is blowing the trumpet has control over the trumpet what naughty wants to sound right you find many people can learn to play an instrument they can memorize chords and memorize solos and play and it will sound good but there is no but there is a difference now note there is a difference from somebody who has a gift because there were lots of other musicians in the time when king saul was tormented of a demon but he needed somebody who had the anointing every note that they plane is an expression it's a sound amen they become one with the instrument have you ever seen somebody lost in playing the instrument or they're just closing their eyes and they're playing and giving their best to the lord amen then you get those that are coming now for the show look at me hey guys i'm here look at me amen but it's coming from inside of them what's on the inside of me god had put it there but god wants to bring it out through that instrument amen now with this concept in mind though the one offering praise is not the praiser you become one with your praise you are no different from the sound that is coming up within you amen you become praise itself you become an instrument of worship lord make me an instrument an instrument of worship i lift up my hands in your name amen you become one with the instrument you are not just a worshiper but you are worship personified your every action is a is a worship to the lord amen what god puts in you controls your future the sound that's coming out of you is going to control your atmosphere it's going to control situations around you gonna control your destiny controls your victory it controls everything because out of the mouth get the life [Music] amen we are instruments we are made to worship wake up every morning with that realization what sound is coming out of you changes everything around you amen amen sounds of complaining and sounds of anger and sounds of sadness and sound of anxiety sounds of bitterness sounds of negativity should not be flowing out of your mouth when you wake up but when we arise in the morning i am blessed i am blessed every day that i live i am blessed when i wake up in the morning till i lay my head to rest i am blessed i am blessed now i want you to know we can't be humble in our praise we can't be humble in our worship we can't be shy we can't be conscious of self when we are worshipping we need to lose ourself in worship we need to be expressive i remember when i first started uh leading praise and worship and i thought i was doing so fantastic and then my father comes to me and saying why are you holding back you need to let go and worship the lord but amen and that taught me a lot in worship because honestly when somebody is first starting out you are self-conscious you are thinking everyone's eyes is on you and you are thinking they're thinking you're starting the song the wrong key and you're thinking this too many thoughts but when you get lost in worship you see what i've learned over the years in leading praise and worship if you are not worshiping here don't expect the people to worship there because you are leading them in praise and worship i find many times song leaders come and they say yeah i need you to back me up this is not your backup choir they are worshiping god you worship from the pulpit you worship god they are not here to pat you on your shoulder and give you an ego boost amen but from the pulpit you're worshiping the lord you're praising his name if there's nobody out there praising and worshiping it should be here because you are the prison worship leader imagine somebody going out to war on the captain of the army saying right kill them kill them and he's standing there chop that fellow there the captain must lead the army so we need to lose ourself in worship your mother and father don't care how you look when you come to church they're not going to think and scold you when you go home while you were raising your hand in church why were you singing in church why were you saying amen in church that's one time your parents will not scold you in the house if they tell you to shut up and sit quiet but not in the house of the lord they'll be excited amen that somebody is worshiping the lord amen let's turn to psalm 150 amen psalm 150 verse 1 it says praise he the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts if you're wondering what do i praise the lord for here's it praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness amen god is not weak praise him for his greatness it's not just great but he's excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet amen praise him with the suntree and the up praise him with a timbrel and dance praise him with stringed instruments amen and organs amen praise him on the sounding symbols hallelujah keep the music quiet you know i'm not hearing problems what's happened with too many conservative people i'm not going to tell you where but too many conservative people are trying to control the worship and stifle the praise do you know why dude okay let me let me break it down for you who controlled music in heaven and who did he control the music for for god so he would know all about worship he would know what levels to play that how many of you know when he organizes these concerts the music is at a certain level because only when the music reaches a certain decibel does it penetrate into the spirit of man do you know that now when we come to church everything must be everything low one day you'll go low six feet low and then you'll wish you were high amen but he says praise him on the loud symbols praise him on the high sounding symbols there is a reason for reaching that pitch there is a reason for that that temple that praise that worship is to penetrate amen the atmosphere of spiritual wickedness and darkness how many of you went into a catholic church and the music is just like you know so don't you feel like you're in a tomb hey you feel like you're in authoria hey sometimes you go to the standpoint and don't you i feel uneasy sounds demonic and at five o'clock in the morning when the demon is crying he is shouting aloud hey is he making a stifle sound he is shouting i'm going to come out at one of your house each morning and shout and call you to pray every morning i'm going to make it how many if you would like that going to call your name some of you might not hear me till 10 o'clock [Music] amen praise him on the loud symbols praise him on the high symbol let everything that i pray praise the lord this is not a option it's a command let everything that have breath praise the lord praise he the lord now he said that the father is seeking those that will worship in spirit and truth now your lawyers and your policemen and those of you that know the law if you do anything contrary to the law what is it ill legal is it legal to do something contrary to the law what is the word i just told you what is it it's illegal when we don't worship god according to god's word it is illegal if we don't worship in spirit and should it's illegal worship when you ask the church to praise the lord and it's a polite praise it's a stifled praise it's illegal praise that is not accepted what is the outcome of presenting an offering to the lord it must be accepted when they went to the lord with a sacrifice it must be accepted amen just worshiping is not just good enough you are waiting to see if it was accepted that is why they are waiting there in revelation 5 they are waiting amen is he accepted because he laid his life down on the cross and here he is the high priest making intercession for 2000 years and they're waiting for him to return from the sanctuary but they're all waiting with painted breath in revelation 5 is it accepted and when it comes forth amen do you know how they cry out and break out into worship amen amen because it was accepted sacrifice amen for when you ask the church to praise and worship the lord i need to polite praise a stifle praise it's illegal praise its illegal worship god is not impressed by worship alone he is specific about what he is looking for many people on the earth are worshiping and from the outside it might look beautiful it may look sincere but god is not impressed by how sincere a person is amen neither should you be yes some people you know you go to these places they're having an emotional experience it brings them to their knees and they cry there's a difference when it's worship it's spirit and your truth amen yes wish amen god is looking at the revelation of the worship think of cain he was sincere sanctuary came to great care to plant a garden he watered the garden all year long he was waiting for this crop he was very sincere in what he was doing and he went to worship the lord offering his fruit offering his sacrifice and you know what it shows the best of the crop and he presented it before the lord he pictured himself but god was not impressed with cain's offering because he had no revelation and god wants you amen to worship him with revelation when we worship god out of an experience and it cost us everything to have this experience you left your family you left everything to follow this message you are despised and rejected of men to follow this message it costs you something children it costs your parents something for you to be in the house of the lord this morning i'm not talking monetary costs but it costs you something you have to forsake everything yes amen it cost some have been through deep trials in their life situations in life and like our sister in the bible went to dark places but it cost you something to go and buy that ointment in an alabaster box it costs you something in spite of our experiences we can't come to god and offer him something that cost us nothing [Music] when it costs us something it is more special when you've been through an experience just say like brother romans last night when he comes into the house of the lord that worship is covered with a special anointing because he is so thankful to the lord when it costs you nothing it does not depict the greatness of god right let's go to second samuel 24 and 24. let's look what our chief psalms told us he wanted to buy the threshing floor so that he could sacrifice to the lord and this man wanted to give it because he heard it was for sacrifice he wanted to give it to david for nothing and even we must learn this even in our own confines somebody may want to offer us a piece of land to build a church we must reject it hello things of god we must place value on it he said that the king said unto aeronaut name but i will surely buy it of thee at a price i know why nobody said amen they are talking to indians this won't go right without theology hey and the king said to aruna nay but i will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will i offer birth offerings unto the lord my god of that which does cost me nothing so david bought the threshing floor and the oxen for 50 shekels of silver it must cost us something amen amen some of you if i break it down it costs you your time to be here this morning it costs you to go against your flesh even though your flesh was failing you and feeling weak to be in the house of the law but you said i must go to the house of the lord this morning and it costs you something to be here we're talking about a shout let's go to joshua chapter 6 and verse 5. take you through the shout the power of the shout the power of the sound that comes out of the redeemed now we know the first conquest was going to be jericho right when they enter the land of the inheritance now remember we're in adoption series we're talking about the land of our inheritance this is the first of the inheritance that they go to possess and in possessing the inheritance captive and a family is going to be set free now watch what i just said there man i heard it for the first time when you are worshiping here now in the house of the lord and your praise is going up captives are going to be set free reyab and her family were trapped in jericho but there was a certain sound of the redeemed that was attached to her deliverance let's read six five and it shall come to pass now the lord told them to march around the city seven days once once each day and on the seventh day seven times and on the seventh day brandon went seven times around the world amen so when it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the rams on and when you hear the sound of the trumpet and all the people shall shout with a great shout amen and the wall of the city shall fall down threat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him that is the command that is given to them now now notice it was it must be a loud cry it must be a shout out 6 10 and the lord and joshua commanded the people saying now watch the shout must be reserved for a certain time six days they were told not to shout six church ages they couldn't have a shout out because the opening of the war did not come you shall not shout that's why from paul to wesley the people didn't have a real shout a message going forth amen no make a noise with your voice conserve your voice preserve your voice for the seventh day neither shall any word proceed of your mouth rest your vocal cords until the day i bit you to shout shall he shout 6 16 and it came to pass at the seventh time hallelujah when that seventh day angel shall begin to sound thunder forth his message when the priest blew with the trumpets fightful ministry is blowing the trumpet and joshua the holy ghost says to the people who standing in the land of the inheritance shout for the lord had given you the city so the people when the priest blew in the trumpet and it came to pass when they heard the sound of the trumpet please walk with me this morning amen and the people shouted with a great shout out and the wall fell down flat so that people went into the city every man straight before him and they took the city amen what happened the shout broke the defense of the enemy the walls of the city was the city's defense but the shout broke down the defense your shout your praise the sound of the redeemed will break down the defense of the enemy this morning oh clap your hands and shout out to god with a voice of triumph somebody say hallelujah somebody say praise the lord amen the children of israel are famous for murmuring and complaining amen why were they told not to make a sound when they go back into your hearts amen you got to preserve your voice for the sunday morning for the wednesday service you can be quiet all the other days of the week in your house but don't stop worshiping the lord maybe you're not talking to your husband maybe you're not talking to your wife but don't stop talking to the lord if you want to complain about your husband or complain about your wife or complain about your children go on your knees and complain to the lord don't say i'm gonna show you i'm gonna put it on facebook face this book and take it to the lord in prayer i'll show you on tick-tock instagram take it to the lord in prayer amen now we can't praise god for a great victory like this or for a great victory that you're trusting the lord for and then we go you go tell your wife i don't know how i'm gonna make it but you just shout it the lord is gonna see me through the situation amen and then after you wake up yeah now we're gonna make it another i don't know how i'm gonna pay my bills and we go with the opposite sound of what we just shouted [Music] opposite sounds cancel one another the atmosphere is important and sound controls the atmosphere praise is a force that god gives us to call amen that call and you know heaven performs even responds according to the sound of our praise amen according to the sound of our worship daniel prayed and the sound of the redeemed went to the lord amen amen amen who responded michael responded amen but he was his response got hindered but it was still coming on the way amen don't stop believing god because there's a delay you don't know what's happening in the heavenlies in the spiritual realm when you are praying and trusting the lord for a miracle when you are praying and trusting the lord for healing god dispatches these angels to meet you at the point of your need yes but maybe they are being opposed by demon powers but you on the earth gonna keep sending out the sound of the redeemed amen break the atmosphere amen we cannot be vague in our worship amen our worship must be intentional it must be directed towards god sounding a victory cry ahead of time hallelujah what's changing the atmosphere in the camp that day amen that's what sounding a shout a shout represents the life energy falls from within us that takes dominion over what is her amen and it brought fear and panic to the inhabitants of jericho amen during the shout changes the atmosphere amen now usually a victory shout or a cry or the sound of the redeemed or praise is reserved for after the victory in normal circumstances but in god's kingdom he tells you shout first praise first give god thanks first amen and it will follow these signs believe first trust god first and then these signs shall follow amen make a declaration first that i am healed and the healing will follow make a declaration amen first then i am delivered amen make a declaration i have a job even though you are unemployed is anybody hearing me this morning amen sound the trumpet amen first amen yes hallelujah we are not in the kingdom of the earth we are in the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of heaven has a law and it says sound the trumpet first make a declaration first so god asks them to shout with a loud voice in victory before they can even attack the enemy and what were they doing changing the conditions changing the atmosphere changing the mindset the battle must be worn in the mind first amen amen hallelujah you find most athletes most competitors are strong mentally amen they are mentally strong that no matter what the pressure is or how odd whatever they are trying to do amen if they are defeated in their mind they will never achieve what they're going to achieve but if a person breaks down mentally they cannot compete at the highest levels and have already lost if you want to compete at the highest level this morning you need to be built up spiritually amen amen what were they doing they were calling those things that were not as though it was that's what we are doing when we are shouting to god with a shout with the sound of the redeemed amen when we are in a big battle don't make a small sound make a loud sound they were calling those things which are not as though they are and evan was recording the sound of their victory this is amen can you imagine before the world of jericho fell down they were hearing the sound of their victory amen amen why you think when somebody is running a race you find their parents cheering them on they're giving them the sound of victory they're applauding them amen hallelujah so heaven responds according to your worship even responds according to your sound it's recording the sound and it responds to that sound you don't believe me the bible says the high priest is touched according to the feelings of our infirmities and the high priest only responds to our confession so whatever we confess that's what the high priest can take before the father [Music] amen so opposite sounds cancel one another faith and doubt cannot operate together faith will cancel doubt and doubt will cancel faith which one are we operating in this morning amen we are going to make a positive confession even though the condition is negative yes amen we must make a positive confession even when the situation is negative that's why we say let the weak say i am strong let the poor say i am rich let the unemployed say i am employed let the sick say i'm healed let the broken married say i have a blessed marriage let the broken hearted say my heart is healed the broken spirits say my spirit is healed like we read the opening scripture let the saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud on their beds with i praise of god in my mouth and a true edge of sword in my hand praise is the sound of victory amen worship is a sound of submission amen when we are in low places in our lives maybe there is no praise within us sure you we need to lift ourselves out of the condition will we go through dark times dark valleys where we don't feel like praising yes we will but we're going to lift ourselves from that condition think of an airplane the pilots in the plane the passengers are on board but in order for him to get off the ground and that's what the sound of the redeemed is doing now taking us from the natural to the supernatural taking us from this weather into heavenly places amen what he needs the airplane does not defy the law of gravity the airplane does not defy the law of gravity the law of gravity is still in effect what happens the plane operates under another law it's operating under the law of lift and in order to get that lift it needs a runway it needs the prison worship service the runway and what does the plane need fuel in the plane to give it a thrust i like that part of the takeoff of the plane you know when you feel that thing that g-force and you just like thrown back in your seat that speed amen so you need the power the sound of the redeemed to trust you so praise is the fuel that gives you the trust the shout within you the life energy source from within you is the is the fuel that gives you the trust to take you to the higher realm of the spirit above your situation above your condition amen when we realize that the life energy force amen through praise and worship and god responds to to that with his presence then he receives our offering amen hallelujah and you know what that does when we see that the lord has received our offering it's better than the sound of applause it's better than any human accolades it beats double wars it beats grammy awards amen why nothing is more rewarding to a worshiper than having the glory of the lord fill the womb like john fell at his feet as a dead man amen the prophet tells us about this man he was a russian and he had composed his musical piece and he was performing it and he performed it so well that the people stood up and gave him a standing ovation standing ovation and the man was not moved but he was looking up at the balcony because the master who had taught him and trained him the tutor he was looking to see what his response was and when he saw the mastermind then he knew he was accepted then he was satisfied he wasn't looking for the applause of man amen and i want to put it out there that we our brothers and our sisters we do not mind you shouting amen we do not mind you praising the lord amen because i know it cost you something amen amen now when the word now this is where we need to draw the distinction because every revival produce their own songs and when we can sing with our portion of the word amen then now we are singing with ammunition the word of god in our mouth with ammunition amen do you hear what i'm saying you got to put the word in your mouth which is the gun and when you speak the word it's like you're pulling the trigger so you got to find the right words that speak about defeating the enemy about overcoming this age load it in your mouth and start firing at the enemy don't shoot blank bullets amen load no weapon formed against me shall prosper headshot load healing is the children's bread [Music] i never had a gang like that man shall not live by bread alone but every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god amen praise must be accompanied with thanksgiving the sound of worship we must come with a thankful heart to the lord thank you jesus the bible says in psalm 92 it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord amen and to sing praises unto his name first thessalonians 5 18 says in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus and i want you to know heaven won't go bankrupt without your praise amen praise is for you to have the victory god has angels in heaven worshiping him and even if you don't worship him god says i'm able to raise up stones rocks amen so evan won't go bankrupt but if you will go bankrupt your life will be fruitless your life will be dry amen hallelujah i'm just going to go two minutes more and touch the highlights of this one time elijah elisha they were going into war and they came in joseph had called elisha and his spirit was grieved because he was angry with this king of israel and because his spirit wasn't right he could not prophesy or speak a word so he said bring me a minstrel bring me an anointed musician right you'll find that in second kings 3 14. amen he says bring me now in minstrel and when the minstrel prayed the hand of the lord came upon him and then he prophesied and said make the valley full of nutrients you remember they wanted water so he said dig out the valley make it full of ditches water is coming what am i saying we need anointing the musicians prayed up musicians anointed amen we'll go to another king i don't want to take another service on this so i'm just going to finish it here jehoshaphat going with the king of israel again they're going out against the army and joseph amen we'll pick it up in secret chronicles 20 21 and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord that they should praise the beauty of his holiness and when they went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy and children forever now watch they haven't started the battle yet but the singers and musicians went before they were calling those things that are not as though they are and when they begin to sing in praise the lord set up ambushments ambushes against the children of ayman moab and mount share would come against judah and they were smitten for the children of eminent moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount sir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of sin everyone helped to destroy one another amen your praise and your worship will confuse the enemy they'll start to kill one another they'll start to attack one another the kingdom of heaven amen will be divided and the kingdom cannot stand once it's divided so it will be torn down but the sound of the routine must go forth amen as a positive confession one time saul was depressed saul was going through a depression he was jealous because god had anointed david and this jealousy had consumed him and he was persecuting david and wanting to kill him he was even tormenting his own son jonathan and he was not a nice king to to have ruling over israel when he was in this depression mode demon powers were oppressing him so they searched for an anointed musician which finally one samuel 16. let's turn to verse 22. saul said to jesse saying let david i pray they stand before me for he has found favor in my sight and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon saul that david took him up and played with his head so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him amen we're close with at 16. new testament paul and silas whipped beaten no reason to praise no reason for the redeemed to have a shout within them the bible says verse 25 and at midnight they were not leaking their wounds at midnight they were not having the third phase of their dream at midnight they were not having a midnight snack at midnight corn and silas prayed and saying praises unto god and the prisoners heard them it wasn't a whisper the prisoners heard them and what happened heaven responded heaven responded to the need for help [Music] and god sent an angel into that prison and there was a great earthquake so that the foundation of the prison was shaken and the doors were open and every one of the bands were loose amen hallelujah praise god this morning let's give the lord let's give the lord a shout of praise your victory in the spirit world in the supernatural world is connected to the sound of the redeemed no matter what situation you're going into life find a place where you can worship god find a place where the sound of worship can flow out of you a many many and if you're feeling down and you need a connection phone your brother phone your sister
