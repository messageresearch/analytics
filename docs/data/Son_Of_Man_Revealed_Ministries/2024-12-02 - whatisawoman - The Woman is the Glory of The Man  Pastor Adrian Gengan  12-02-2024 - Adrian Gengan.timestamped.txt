[2:58] have you come for Sunday school yes
[2:59] unless we come with childlike Faith yes
[3:01] amen amen amen praise the Lord amen so
[3:05] when we come into father's house we
[3:06] ought to have a rejoicing time amen we
[3:08] go everywhere else and we have a good
[3:10] time we come into the house of the Lord
[3:11] and we have a good time amen praise the
[3:13] Lord amen don't want to keep you
[3:15] standing for too long we'll turn to our
[3:17] Bibles praise the Lord first uh let's
[3:20] turn to 1 Corinthians chapter
[3:23] 11 many times we turn to the scripture
[3:25] to go to the
[3:27] communion but the opening verses of this
[3:30] is what we want to dwell
[3:33] on Amen I'll read the scripture and then
[3:36] we'll make our opening
[3:38] remarks amen praise the
[3:41] Lord from verse one it says be ye
[3:45] followers of me even as I also am of
[3:50] Christ amen now he's got a reason for
[3:52] telling you this right if you're going
[3:54] to follow the Apostle Paul he's going to
[3:56] lead you in a journey he says now I
[3:59] praise you brother that you remember me
[4:00] in all things and keep the ordinances as
[4:03] I have delivered them to you amen see so
[4:06] if you're following him you must keep
[4:07] the ordinances we can't say we follow
[4:10] the message of the hour and then we
[4:11] don't keep the ordinances right but I
[4:14] would have you know that the head of
[4:17] every man is Christ and the head of the
[4:22] woman is
[4:24] the and the head of Christ
[4:27] is amen praise the Lord now in a 21st
[4:31] century women don't like to read the
[4:34] scripture but the word of God is
[4:36] unchanging amen we can't deviate from
[4:38] the word of God so I want to reiterate
[4:41] you but I would have you know that the
[4:43] head of every man is Christ and the head
[4:46] of the woman is the man and the head of
[4:48] Christ is God Amen every man praying or
[4:53] prophesying having his head covered
[4:55] dishonor his head now what is this
[4:58] covering the Apostle Paul Paul will
[5:00] detail that covering in a further verse
[5:02] down and but every woman that prayeth or
[5:06] prophesieth with a head uncovered
[5:08] dishonor her head for that is even as
[5:12] [Music]
[5:14] one for that is even all one even as
[5:19] she even as she was shaven right for if
[5:23] the woman be not covered let her also be
[5:25] shown but if she but if it be a shame
[5:28] for a woman to be sha or shaven let her
[5:31] be
[5:32] covered now this is the verse we want to
[5:34] dwell on for a man indeed ought not to
[5:37] cover his head for as much as he is the
[5:41] image and glory of God but the woman is
[5:44] the glory of the
[5:46] man for the man is not of the woman but
[5:49] the woman of the man now you see how in
[5:52] a 21st century they have tried to
[5:55] disassociate them they tried to make
[5:57] them live separately but yet here it's
[5:59] saying the man is not of the woman but
[6:02] the woman of the man neither was the Man
[6:04] created for the woman but the woman for
[6:07] the
[6:08] man amen sisters don't go into your
[6:11] shell amen praise the Lord amen I'm just
[6:15] reading the scripture neither was the
[6:17] Man created for the woman but the woman
[6:19] for the man for this cause ought the
[6:21] woman to have power on her head because
[6:24] of the Angels nevertheless neither is
[6:27] the man without the woman so man come be
[6:29] reproduced without a woman so they both
[6:31] need each other right neither the woman
[6:34] without the man in the Lord for as the
[6:36] woman is of the man even so is the man
[6:39] also by the woman but all things of God
[6:42] judging yourself is it comely that a
[6:44] woman pray unto God uncovered does not
[6:47] even nature itself teach you that if a
[6:49] man have long hair it is a shame unto
[6:52] him so you see what the covering is but
[6:55] if a woman have long hair it is a glory
[6:57] to her for for her hair is given as a
[7:01] given her for a
[7:02] covering but if any man seem to be
[7:04] contentious we have no such custom
[7:07] neither the Churches of God Amen you may
[7:09] be seated the Lord at blessings to the
[7:11] reading of his
[7:14] word I'd like to title
[7:16] it what is a
[7:20] woman
[7:22] amen what is a woman you'll know this
[7:25] title if you Google it if you YouTube it
[7:30] you'll know there's a question going on
[7:31] in the world what is a woman I think the
[7:35] man that investigated it or tried to
[7:37] interview people is Matt
[7:39] Walsh am I right brother Joshua is it
[7:42] Matt Walsh what is a
[7:44] woman the reason he's asking that
[7:46] question is because the political world
[7:50] and the secular world don't want to take
[7:53] a position on what is a
[7:55] woman because of the transgender
[7:58] movement and because of all the pressure
[8:00] because Sodom now is at its
[8:03] Glory Sodom is being
[8:06] exalted amen praise the
[8:09] Lord so everything is reaching its
[8:14] Pinnacle and they don't want to Define
[8:17] what is a woman the reason they don't
[8:19] want to Define what a woman is is
[8:23] because of
[8:25] Genesis they don't want to admit that
[8:28] the mystery is between man and woman
[8:31] between Christ and the church so what
[8:33] have they done now they started out with
[8:35] women's Liberation in the'
[8:38] 60s and they've come now and they
[8:40] totally stripped the woman of her
[8:42] identity that they can't even tell you
[8:44] what is a woman if you watch the
[8:47] documentary it's shocking that
[8:49] politicians are not able to take a
[8:50] position and tell you what is a woman
[8:54] they refuse to take a stand on that they
[8:56] will evade the question now if if I had
[8:59] to ask all the menia This Morning Show
[9:02] Me Your
[9:06] Glory what would you show
[9:09] me what would you show me would you show
[9:12] me your
[9:13] muscle would you show me your wealth and
[9:15] all that you accumulated your car your
[9:18] house what would you show me if I asked
[9:20] you to show me your
[9:22] glory because man has
[9:27] Glory right
[9:30] and that's where I get to my
[9:32] subtitle the woman is the glory of the
[9:36] man
[9:38] Hallelujah so sisters you can come back
[9:41] out of your shell because if your
[9:43] somebody ask your husband Show Me Your
[9:45] Glory they must point to the
[9:47] [Music]
[9:49] wife all right brother Joshua we need to
[9:53] put 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 7
[9:57] again amen because now now the men have
[9:59] gone into their
[10:00] shell you see
[10:04] amen when we were reading the Scriptures
[10:06] it seems like the woman got into their
[10:08] shell but now the men have got into
[10:10] their shell what is the Bible saying men
[10:12] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[10:14] head for as much as he is the image and
[10:16] glory of God but the woman is the glory
[10:20] of the man amen
[10:23] amen
[10:25] hallelujah so we got both and men and
[10:27] women out of the shelves this morning
[10:29] amen amen praise the
[10:31] Lord let's take the origin of woman
[10:34] because we asking the question what is a
[10:36] woman we need to go to Genesis CH 2: 18
[10:40] and see how woman was first created
[10:42] we're going to get along in this message
[10:43] but we just need to lay the scriptures
[10:45] because it's important for the younger
[10:47] people growing up they've got to know
[10:49] these scriptures and we've also got to
[10:51] instill in them because soon they will
[10:52] make choices in life and we have got to
[10:56] instruct them and lead them how to make
[10:58] correct
[10:59] choices many of you would know the
[11:01] choices you made was because of the
[11:04] ministry you were under that constantly
[11:06] told you what to do and how to
[11:09] choose amen so you got it I'm talking
[11:12] about Pastor Ronnie time to time he
[11:14] would speak to the people and tell them
[11:15] what to choose and how to choose and all
[11:18] of those things those things be you
[11:20] become impressionable it ingrains in
[11:22] your mind so when you are making choices
[11:24] you make the correct choices yes amen
[11:27] praise the Lord don't be ashamed to say
[11:29] Amen don't be afraid to say Amen this
[11:31] morning Genesis 2:8 we reading the word
[11:34] of God so we all be
[11:36] excited and the Lord said it is not good
[11:38] that the man should be alone first thing
[11:42] man is lonely without a
[11:44] woman amen praise the Lord it is not
[11:48] good that the man should be
[11:51] alone I will make him and help meet for
[11:54] him so what is woman to
[11:57] man a help meat
[11:59] so I'm going to help you know how to ask
[12:03] your wife for
[12:04] things so instead of asking you for tea
[12:07] can you tell her can you help me make
[12:08] some
[12:11] tea she's a help meat so you ask her can
[12:14] you help me make some tea can you help
[12:17] me do this and what is her job she's a
[12:19] help meat don't instruct a woman come
[12:25] here she is an help meat right and out
[12:29] of the ground so remember now this is
[12:31] after the sixth day creation seventh day
[12:34] the Lord rested so the woman was not in
[12:36] the original creation but she was locked
[12:39] up as a hidden Mystery inside of
[12:42] man okay and out of the ground the Lord
[12:46] formed every beast of the field every
[12:48] fowl of the air and brought them unto
[12:50] Adam to see what he would call
[12:53] them and whatsoever Adam called every
[12:56] living creature that was the name
[13:00] thereof and Adam gave names to all the
[13:03] cattle to the fowl of the air to every
[13:06] beast of the field but for Adam there
[13:08] was not found an Al meat for
[13:11] him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep
[13:14] to fall upon
[13:16] Adam and he slipped and he took one of
[13:19] his ribs and he closed up the flesh
[13:21] instead thereof so you see woman is
[13:23] taken from man not from the
[13:26] ground and the Lord God caused a deep
[13:29] sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
[13:31] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[13:33] the flesh instead thereof and the rib
[13:36] which the Lord God had taken from man
[13:39] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[13:43] man now when he sees his heart starts to
[13:47] flatter he gets butterflies in his
[13:49] stomach come on
[13:52] Brothers amen and I'm giving you some
[13:55] time because some of you have to think
[13:57] way back amen but you know the first
[14:01] time you saw how you felt amen praise
[14:05] the Lord don't get too excited brothers
[14:07] and Shout amen amen what does Adam say
[14:10] when he sees
[14:13] her this is now bone of my bone who is
[14:17] giving her her identity
[14:20] man so what is a woman she's
[14:24] born of his
[14:27] bone it says here Flesh of My Flesh so
[14:31] the only one that can answer the
[14:33] question to what is a woman is man yes
[14:36] amen amen I'm giving you Bible now amen
[14:40] the only one that can tell you and
[14:41] Define what a woman is is
[14:44] man amen this is now bone of my bone
[14:48] Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called
[14:51] woman because she was taken out of man
[14:55] that woman is a HED man a woman with a
[14:57] whom okay therefore shall a man leave
[15:01] his father and mother and shall cleave
[15:03] unto his wife and they shall be one
[15:07] flesh okay then we'll go to Proverbs
[15:09] 18:22 so you see the origins of a woman
[15:13] Proverbs 18:22 says he who finds a wife
[15:17] finds a good
[15:19] thing and obtains favor from the
[15:22] Lord so if you're looking for extra
[15:24] favor get married find a good wife amen
[15:28] you see we have favor all the married
[15:32] men all the married men who have favor
[15:34] in the house this morning raise your
[15:36] hand and say I have double favor amen
[15:39] praise the
[15:40] Lord hallelujah see I'm preparing you
[15:43] now for romantic
[15:48] afternoon
[15:50] 4:00 amen you see your wife's going to
[15:53] be very happy with you because all of
[15:55] you raised your
[15:57] hand Proverbs 12:4
[16:01] says I'm reading two versions here I'll
[16:03] read one version a wife of notable
[16:06] character is a husband's
[16:08] Crown but she who causes shame is like
[16:11] decay in his
[16:13] bones another the King James says a
[16:15] virtuous woman is a crown to her husband
[16:19] but she that maketh ashamed is as Rott
[16:21] Us in his bones amen praise the Lord one
[16:24] more scripture and I'm reading from the
[16:26] Amplified Bible Proverbs study 1: 10 he
[16:30] says an excellent woman now that
[16:33] excellent woman is one who is spiritual
[16:36] capable intelligent and
[16:39] virtuous who is he who can find
[16:42] her a value is more precious than jewels
[16:47] and a worth is far above rubies or
[16:52] pearls so young sisters don't get
[16:55] excited when somebody gives you flowers
[16:58] and gives you things because you are
[17:01] worth more than rubies you are worth
[17:03] more than
[17:05] flowers all
[17:07] right so we we spoke about what is a
[17:11] woman it's bone of man's bone flesh of
[17:13] man's flesh identity is found in him so
[17:16] she shall be called woman right womed
[17:18] man she's taken out of man and now very
[17:21] important is that the woman is the
[17:24] beding ground for his seed to reproduce
[17:27] himself amen
[17:29] amen yes a man cannot put his seed in
[17:32] another man and reproduce himself right
[17:35] that's what Sodom is telling you
[17:37] yeah right can only do it by putting his
[17:41] seed in the bedding ground of a
[17:45] woman a man has no bding ground I'm
[17:48] going to say it in this way and I hope
[17:49] you understand what I am saying you
[17:51] can't take a seed put it in a trash can
[17:53] and expect it to
[17:55] grow it's got to go into the right Bing
[17:58] ground
[18:00] amen amen so what is a woman a woman is
[18:03] an extension of man and together they
[18:06] possess the power to reproduce another
[18:09] son and daughter of God
[18:12] Amen so ultimate glory is when man and
[18:16] wife come together and the woman
[18:18] reproduces the seed of the man and
[18:20] brings forth a child in his likeness and
[18:23] after his image hallelujah amen amen
[18:27] hallelujah I hope you're seeing the
[18:29] spiritual picture as well here amen
[18:32] hallelujah yeah in the in the choosing
[18:34] of a bride the prophet says now notice
[18:36] again how the natural bride types the
[18:38] spiritual the word says she was made for
[18:41] the man and not the man made for
[18:45] her okay all other females in the
[18:49] original creation Birds male and female
[18:53] animals male and female but in human
[18:55] life God only made a man and he took
[18:58] from him and the woman is the byproduct
[19:01] of a man because God did not Institute
[19:04] such a
[19:05] thing now listen to what he says here
[19:08] but if she can hold herself right the
[19:11] woman what a greater reward she has than
[19:14] man amen she's put on a testing ground
[19:18] and through her Came Death she's guilty
[19:20] of all death but then God turns around
[19:23] and used one one that's Mary now to
[19:26] bring life back again brought his son
[19:28] through the woman an obedient one amen
[19:32] amen amen praise the Lord so what is the
[19:35] meaning of Glory we'll just go through
[19:36] this again it's magnificence it's the
[19:39] Splendor it's the Brilliance it's the
[19:41] Beauty and the Majesty amen
[19:47] amen so I'll say this that the highest
[19:50] form of man's Glory will be found in the
[19:53] woman yes
[19:57] am
[19:58] if you're thinking spiritual now you
[20:00] know what I'm telling you yes amen the
[20:03] highest form of God's glory is found in
[20:05] the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[20:11] amen I'll tell you something now amen
[20:13] praise the Lord I want to get ahead of
[20:15] myself the highest form of man's Glory
[20:17] will be found in his woman that is God's
[20:20] design and pattern that is revealed in
[20:21] Genesis 1 2 and 3 and Ephesians 5 and 1
[20:25] Corinthians 11 the design and hidden
[20:27] Mystery is that this mystery between
[20:29] Christ and the church Jesus and his
[20:32] bride that is why Jesus is presenting to
[20:35] himself a glorious church amen his glory
[20:38] is reflected in her am the woman is in
[20:42] His image and likeness taken from his
[20:44] very own side will be his greatest
[20:49] Glory that is the mystery of Oneness
[20:51] between man and woman they both shall be
[20:53] one flesh so no matter how great a man
[20:55] is in the Life in this life he is not
[20:58] not crowned with Glory with his Earthly
[21:01] accomplishments with what he owns with
[21:03] his wealth his Prestige his status a man
[21:07] can have all of this but man's greatest
[21:09] glory is found in the woman amen
[21:12] hallelujah I'm goinging Bible
[21:16] again man's greatest glory is found in
[21:19] the
[21:21] woman the most successful men need a
[21:24] good supportive wife loyal wife who
[21:28] stands beside him and supports him puts
[21:30] away because a woman is sacrificial
[21:32] she'll put away her own
[21:35] desires and She'll follow the man like
[21:37] Rebecca
[21:39] did willing to sacrifice everything they
[21:42] have to follow the man but if she is
[21:45] prepared to sacrifice everything and
[21:47] follow the man where are you leading her
[21:52] to amen praise the
[21:56] Lord so we find here
[22:00] that the husband loves the wife that's
[22:04] companion as his own body that's
[22:07] Ephesians chapter 5 now loves his wife
[22:10] as his own body and we know that the
[22:14] Bible is asking for the woman to be
[22:15] submissive to the man who loves
[22:18] her everybody understand a non-s
[22:21] submissive wife can ruin a man and she
[22:24] becomes water in his blood so you he the
[22:27] prophet is saying
[22:28] woman was made for man not man for woman
[22:32] that's just what the devil took the
[22:33] woman in the Garden of Eden for his
[22:36] instrument he is still using her amen
[22:40] now how many of you know that Satan is
[22:43] an original
[22:46] thinker he thinks of stuff original he
[22:48] doesn't counterfeit anything or is he a
[22:52] copycat so if he is still using her why
[22:55] is he using woman
[22:58] yeah
[22:59] absolutely amen you see as this
[23:01] Revelation unfolds we'll start to see
[23:04] our value amen and Christ's greatest
[23:08] Glory will be found in this time yes
[23:12] amen the reason he's using woman to this
[23:14] level and this extent and putting her in
[23:16] the Forefront is because God is putting
[23:19] his woman in the Forefront
[23:21] amenah amen he says not the converted
[23:25] not the converted the woman that's a
[23:27] Christian and a good woman is the best
[23:30] thing that a man could find Outside
[23:32] salvation praise the Lord amen the woman
[23:35] too can say praise the Lord praise the
[23:37] Lord
[23:41] amen hallelujah you see you need to
[23:44] remind the man I am the best thing given
[23:47] to you outside of
[23:50] Salvation more than your
[23:53] offender more than your
[23:56] piis amen praise the
[24:01] Lord but one that ain't no good is the
[24:04] worst thing you could find Outside
[24:06] Solomon said a good woman was a jewel in
[24:09] a man's Crown but an unrighteous one was
[24:11] water in his blood his blood is his life
[24:14] so how much more could he have could he
[24:17] have than water in his blood it would
[24:18] kill
[24:19] him so we know the saying beside be
[24:22] behind every successful man is a good
[24:25] woman praise the Lord how many
[24:28] successful men we have
[24:29] here praise the Lord praise the Lord I
[24:32] know youve taking time but raise it
[24:34] raise it Brothers raise it I'm trying to
[24:35] help
[24:37] you outside of Salvation the best thing
[24:40] that God gave a man is a good woman Good
[24:43] Wife now have you ever asked yourself or
[24:47] maybe ask yourself now and consider it
[24:49] why did Satan go after the
[24:53] woman you see if you if you want to
[24:56] attack man
[24:58] what will you
[24:59] attack if you want man to fall and if
[25:02] you are jealous of this man you are
[25:04] jealous of his Godlike nature it's
[25:07] Godlike stature because you remember
[25:09] Satan wanted to be like the most high
[25:11] now God created man to be like him yes
[25:14] man is like the most high now this man
[25:16] is now your enemy you're envious of him
[25:19] you jealous of him you want him to fall
[25:21] you plotting his demise what will you do
[25:24] you will go for his
[25:26] glory yeah come on now yes yeah you may
[25:31] not have not seen the scripture in this
[25:33] light but if you want to attack a man
[25:35] you go for his glory
[25:38] yes so he goes after the woman because
[25:41] woman is the glory of
[25:43] man yes you get the woman to fall you
[25:47] take away his
[25:50] glory and Adam can't help it but
[25:53] manifest the attributes of
[25:55] Christ and go after his wife yeah amen
[25:58] amen praise the Lord so this was the
[26:02] glory of man the woman the one carrying
[26:04] his glory is the woman and but now she
[26:07] was easily deceived because she was a
[26:09] byproduct taken out of
[26:14] man now why does Adam ask another
[26:17] question now why does Adam take the
[26:19] woman and covers her by partaking of the
[26:26] fruit he in Christ okay the answer is he
[26:30] is redeeming his
[26:33] glory he's going after his glory yes he
[26:37] wants it back so he tries to redeem His
[26:39] Glory by eating the fruit and protecting
[26:42] the woman but he finds that the
[26:44] consequences are too great The Action
[26:47] the consequences of the actions are
[26:49] against God's word and the consequence
[26:52] is punishment by death and he loses his
[26:56] Godlike nature and Power power and he he
[26:58] loses eternal life fellowship with God
[27:01] power over the
[27:03] earth now this will require a blood
[27:06] Covenant and God responds in the Garden
[27:08] of Eden by coming and slaying a lamb
[27:11] this was typing the Lamb of God Jesus
[27:13] Christ that would come to take away the
[27:15] sin of the world and whosoever believes
[27:17] on him should not perish but have
[27:19] everlasting life can we give God praise
[27:22] for that amen he's redeeming
[27:25] us now I just told there in a very short
[27:28] thing summary that Adam went after Eve
[27:31] because that was her his glory Christ
[27:35] left the glory of Heaven the Splendor of
[27:37] Heaven to come for a greater glory woman
[27:39] is the glory of man Hallelujah yes Lord
[27:42] amen amen amen so the union between man
[27:46] and woman is meant to reflect the union
[27:48] between God and man now listen to this
[27:51] young people and those of you amen
[27:53] that's married or planning to get
[27:55] married man and woman Unite uned as one
[27:59] and this one man and woman under the
[28:01] headship of God that's the order man and
[28:04] woman will come United as one but they
[28:08] as one flesh must be under the covering
[28:11] of
[28:12] God okay
[28:15] therefore the word of God must be the
[28:18] core third core that binds any marriage
[28:20] for it to be
[28:22] successful when you hear Minister say
[28:25] Have Jesus in the center of your
[28:26] marriage don't have an imaginary Jesus
[28:29] this is the Jesus you should put in your
[28:31] marriage amen yes amen this is Jesus in
[28:35] print
[28:38] form amen for the marriage to be
[28:41] successful you must base it on the word
[28:43] of God to put God first in a
[28:45] relationship is to put the written word
[28:47] of God
[28:48] first to love God is to love his word to
[28:52] strengthen your relationship to have a
[28:54] healthy marriage the word the Bible must
[28:57] be the sensual theme you must be able to
[28:59] talk about the word you must be able to
[29:01] Fellowship about the word you must be
[29:03] able to have communion around the
[29:08] word amen praise the Lord don't just
[29:11] talk to your wife about what car you
[29:12] want what this you want what that you
[29:14] want tell her what you read in the word
[29:17] talk to her she'll tell you what she
[29:19] read talk to each other about the word
[29:21] of God if you want to strengthen your
[29:25] relationship read the word of God
[29:28] talk about the word of God Amen praise
[29:30] the Lord and everybody said amen amen
[29:35] amen praise the
[29:37] Lord some of you don't want to say Amen
[29:39] because you say I didn't come here for
[29:41] marriage
[29:42] counseling amen but we want strong
[29:45] marriages amen amen the woman is the
[29:48] glory of the man
[29:53] amen so we know the woman is taken out
[29:56] of man man glory is found in the woman
[29:58] who is under submission and reverence
[30:02] that's what the Bible
[30:04] says now she must not take man's Glory
[30:07] if she is representing man and
[30:09] reflecting man's Glory she can't take it
[30:11] and use it for her own
[30:15] purposes she can't be
[30:21] independent she can't be independent of
[30:23] man neither can the church be
[30:26] independent of the Holy Spirit
[30:29] this is a total violation of
[30:31] scripture when they talk about being an
[30:33] independent woman that's not according
[30:35] to
[30:37] scripture woman cannot be independent
[30:40] but she needs to be dependent on the
[30:42] man the two shall become one flesh the
[30:46] gospel of Independence the gospel of
[30:48] girl power the gospel of woman's right
[30:51] woman's Liberation movement is the
[30:53] gospel of Satan to M and Destroy God's
[30:56] original plan for for the union between
[30:58] man and wom yes Amen to pervert woman
[31:02] and to take away man's Glory yes amen
[31:06] that's right all that woman is is for
[31:09] the man she was taken out of the man so
[31:11] the Magnificent Splendor the majesty and
[31:14] the beauty is not to be used for our own
[31:17] self but it is man's glory
[31:20] amen oh Hallelujah I wish you would help
[31:24] me preach this morning amen Satan has
[31:26] exploited this by exalting the woman to
[31:28] a position where she becomes an idol she
[31:31] makes herself a sex object a symbol and
[31:34] and yes patent her and designed the
[31:36] woman to become an object of lust an
[31:38] object of Desire stri the woman of their
[31:41] decency and stripped her of her morals
[31:43] made her believe that she has equal
[31:45] rights when the Bible in said in Genesis
[31:47] 3 the woman The man shall have rule over
[31:49] you amen amen Satan knows the glory of a
[31:54] man is a woman so if he violates woman
[31:57] he violates man's Glory
[32:01] yes you see when a woman is not
[32:03] submissive to a man and does not
[32:05] reverence him she is taking away his
[32:09] glory and when a woman does not love his
[32:12] wife and give himself for her he is
[32:14] cutting himself off from his own
[32:17] Glory oh I need you to say Amen don't go
[32:20] into your shell amen hallelujah this is
[32:23] going to help you amen when a man
[32:26] doesn't love wife as his own flesh as
[32:29] his own body he is cutting himself off
[32:31] from his own
[32:35] Glory so you see both can cut the glory
[32:38] off a woman who is not submissive can
[32:40] cut the glory yes a man who doesn't love
[32:43] her as his own flesh can cut the
[32:48] glory when a man does not love his wife
[32:50] and give himself for is cutting off
[32:52] himself from his own Glory if a man does
[32:54] not take care of his wife
[32:57] he is not taking care of his glory
[33:01] amen if a man hates his wife he hates
[33:04] himself and hates his own
[33:09] glory
[33:11] amen praise the
[33:13] Lord you see glory is important to a man
[33:16] it's what gives him
[33:18] purpose he's like God
[33:24] yes if I forget the scripture you remind
[33:27] me right that God will not share his
[33:28] glory with any man you'll remind me when
[33:30] I say remind
[33:32] me okay I'm talking to you brother
[33:34] Joshua you'll remind me okay cuz this
[33:37] thought keeps coming in my head and goes
[33:39] away but I don't want to say it now amen
[33:42] glory is important to a man it's what
[33:45] gives him purpose what gives him reason
[33:47] to live God created him that way that is
[33:49] why man will Thrive when he's seen as a
[33:53] hero man will Thrive when he is praised
[33:56] by his wife
[33:57] yes if the wife belittles a husband and
[34:01] calls him names and makes fun of him it
[34:03] bruises his ego it crushes him because
[34:06] of his glory yes she's his glory yes the
[34:11] one that that he wants to admire him the
[34:14] one that he wants to look up to
[34:16] him is not not seeing him as he wants to
[34:19] be
[34:21] seen now this goes with praise and
[34:23] worshiping God as
[34:24] well if we do not praise and worship
[34:27] God we are not seeing him as he wants us
[34:30] to see him we are not worshiping as he
[34:32] wants us to worship
[34:36] him so a man needs praise and adoration
[34:39] because he is like
[34:42] God and the sad reality of it is why so
[34:45] many marriages end in adulteries and
[34:47] Affairs because what they were supposed
[34:49] to be receiving at home they are not
[34:51] getting so they look for it
[34:54] elsewhere man will go searching for it
[34:56] in Other Woman and woman will go find it
[34:59] in another man women thrives on
[35:01] compliments women likes to be told they
[35:04] are beautiful woman likes to be told

[35:24] glorious when this pattern and blueprint
[35:27] that God designed is followed and built
[35:28] upon
[35:31] amen married couples are problems when
[35:34] either one are not willing and no longer
[35:36] want to function according to the word
[35:37] of God as one unit with one goal one
[35:40] plan and they start to pursue their own
[35:42] plans yes amen amen praise the Lord you
[35:46] see that's what happened when I said the
[35:48] woman must not take the glory for her
[35:49] own self and exalted that's what
[35:51] happened in the Book of
[35:53] Esther yes amen this King

[42:02] there they are cut off from the glory
[42:04] amen
[42:06] hio amen praise the
[42:09] Lord now you know now you what happens
[42:13] the king looks for another wife he go
[42:16] through the story beautiful story you
[42:18] know why denominational people say they
[42:20] can't see God in the story they don't
[42:22] know the message of the hour you know
[42:24] they say this is one book the name of
[42:26] God is not mentioned but they can't see
[42:28] the types and the Shadows there only the
[42:30] message of the hour can preach it this
[42:32] wayah it's a hidden Mystery only two
[42:35] books in the Bible are written after
[42:36] women Ruth and Esther Ruth is being
[42:40] redeemed and Esther is Queen amen after
[42:44] Redemption she shares in his glory NOW
[42:47] Watch What Happens here you find that
[42:49] Aon starts to build his reputation with
[42:52] the King I'm telling summarizing the
[42:54] story Aon starts to build his reputation
[42:56] with the King and he now becomes second
[42:58] in charge the king even gives him his
[43:01] signal to start to make laws and decrees
[43:02] in the
[43:03] land so next in charge to the
[43:08] King after his Splendor and Majesty is
[43:12] Aon right he can do anything in the
[43:14] Kingdom that's why he starts to make
[43:16] this thing where everyone must bow down
[43:18] before him now watch this pattern it was
[43:21] the same thing in Babylon because they
[43:23] made an image and they wanted Shadrach
[43:26] mishak and Abednego to Bon before this
[43:29] image if you read the story you'll find
[43:32] that Moni was also taken in captivity
[43:34] during the same time
[43:37] am yes so they asked Modi why are you
[43:40] not bwing to Amon he says I'm a Jew and
[43:44] I will not bow down to anyone else but
[43:46] God so Amon hears about this and he
[43:49] starts to tell the king that there's a
[43:51] group of people here who don't serve you
[43:53] really well they have no use to you
[43:55] let's k kill them so he devises a plan
[43:58] to kill
[44:00] them right at this time Now esther is
[44:04] already Queen yes I'm going to ahead in
[44:07] the story Now esther is walking in as
[44:10] Queen with a title
[44:14] Queen but she doesn't realize Authority
[44:18] nor is it given to her after Kingdom yet
[44:21] there's a waiting period amen but at a
[44:24] certain time
[44:26] here comes the glory of the
[44:30] Lord why The Story Goes Like This monah
[44:35] goes to Esther or Russia gets word to
[44:37] Esther and tells Esther this is the
[44:39] thing that Aon has done if you don't get
[44:41] to the king and tell him and make
[44:43] petitions on behalf of your people
[44:45] you're going to perish and your people
[44:46] are going to perish yes and don't think
[44:49] you're going to be spared what happens
[44:51] is
[44:51] that Esther tells modah the king has
[44:56] shut his glory off from the
[44:58] people nobody can enter into his
[45:04] presence the one that enters into his
[45:06] presence Uninvited will be
[45:09] killed yes amen so she must make a
[45:13] decision whether she will enter into the
[45:15] glory Realm of the king hallelujah amen
[45:18] amen who shall Ascend the hill of the
[45:20] Lord but he that has C Clean Hands in a

[45:59] can come into the sh of Glory she has
[46:01] got to enter in because she has rights
[46:03] as the queen yes amen amen so she steps
[46:07] into the glory realm and when the king
[46:10] sees her he sees his glory coming in
[46:13] because the woman is the glory of a
[46:18] man oh I wish I was preaching to some
[46:21] people who was catching the Revelation
[46:22] this morning the woman is the glory of
[46:24] the man so when he sees his heart starts
[46:27] to get excited he sees his glory
[46:29] approaching in
[46:31] amen he sees the queen coming before him
[46:34] he raises his Royal
[46:38] scepter and he says what can I do for
[46:41] you what will you have even to half the
[46:44] kingdom there he gives her identity
[46:46] there he gives her the
[46:48] glory what happens in that instant when
[46:50] she gets into the glory realm she takes
[46:53] the place of amen amen she's now second
[46:56] in charge she's now joint ears amen

[47:02] the glory realm thank you I never told
[47:05] you I want to announce this again I
[47:07] never told you this will be the most
[47:08] glorious year for the church maybe you
[47:10] misunderstood it I said you need to
[47:12] enter into the glory realm to share with
[47:14] his
[47:16] glory it's only for those who will enter
[47:18] into the glory realm thank you Lord that
[47:21] he will say sh in my glory remind me now
[47:24] what I was telling you
[47:27] amen sorry why God won't share his glory
[47:29] with any man because God won't share his
[47:33] glory with any man is because like a
[47:36] woman won't share her husband with any
[47:40] man sorry like a man won't share his
[47:42] woman with any man who's the glory of
[47:45] God Amen I'm I'm giving you another
[47:48] meaning of that scripture now pay
[47:50] attention God won't share his glory with
[47:54] any other amen yes are you catching
[47:59] it if woman is the glory of
[48:01] man and you are the glory of God Amen
[48:05] God won't share his glory with another
[48:08] yes
[48:09] amen yes amen amen praise the Lord oh
[48:13] there's some wonderful things in here
[48:15] amen praise the Lord amen now you know
[48:17] Brothers why I said we don't have enough
[48:19] time and services to preach his glorious
[48:21] Revelation amen amen praise the Lord
[48:25] hallelujah when it opens up it becomes
[48:27] glorious am amen coming out coming out
[48:31] coming out it's like a spring let's
[48:33] let's go to 1 Timothy Chapter 2 amen
[48:35] let's move along praise the Lord
[48:38] hallelujah I'm almost done with my first
[48:42] sermon amen you know the Lord has given
[48:45] us such a cool weather yeah that's right
[48:47] amen and I preached the message of an
[48:51] hour but I know you love double portion
[48:54] am
[48:56] amen praise the
[48:57] Lord 1 Timothy Chapter 2 says I will
[49:01] therefore that men pray everywhere
[49:03] lifting up holy hands without wrath and
[49:06] doubting right what are the men ought to
[49:09] be doing praying lifting up holy
[49:11] hands in like manner also the women
[49:14] Adorn themselves in modest apparel with
[49:16] shamefacedness and sobriety not with
[49:19] broided hair gold pearls costly array
[49:23] but which becometh woman prophesying
[49:25] godliness with good works so what have
[49:28] you got to trade let's go back to that
[49:29] verse there you need to
[49:32] trade broided Air Gold pearls and costly
[49:36] array you need to trade that for
[49:38] what good
[49:41] works right that's what the Bible is
[49:43] telling you there now let the woman
[49:45] learn in Silence with all
[49:47] subjection but I suffer not a woman to
[49:50] teach nor to Asser authority over the
[49:52] man but to be in silence for for Adam
[49:56] was formed first formed then
[49:58] Eve and Adam was not deceived but the
[50:01] woman being deceived was in the
[50:05] transgression not withstanding she shall
[50:07] be saved in childbearing some of our
[50:10] women are going to be extra saved
[50:14] here not withstanding she shall be saved
[50:17] in shall bearing if they continue in
[50:20] faith and charity and Holiness and
[50:24] sobriety
[50:26] so the glory of a man is the woman and
[50:30] the glory now if you're wondering what
[50:32] the glory is the glory is not a natural
[50:35] beauty but it is a character
[50:41] yes here the prophet talking about the
[50:44] Church of Christ now he says may
[50:46] everyone who comes in see the beautiful
[50:49] characteristics of Jesus Christ in every
[50:52] person that comes in made be a
[50:55] consecrated place to our Lord a
[50:57] consecrated people for no matter how
[51:00] beautiful the structure is that we
[51:02] certainly do appreciate the beauty of
[51:04] the church is the character of the
[51:06] people
[51:08] amen I trust it'll always be a house of
[51:12] God of beauty
[51:21] right let me Define this and we can try
[51:25] and find a point of closing if you don't
[51:27] want to close it's also fine I'll see
[51:29] how the Lord leads right now amen so
[51:32] what does it mean to share God's glory
[51:36] how will he share his glory with us is
[51:39] it going to be something that is super
[51:41] duper how is he going to share his glory
[51:44] with us if the inspiration is sharing
[51:46] his glory in 2024 how will we share in
[51:50] his glory a good question right how will
[51:53] we share in his
[51:54] glory
[51:58] you can't be anything out of the
[52:02] word amen so
[52:05] potentially even in Ephesians 1:18 he
[52:08] talking about sharing in The Riches of
[52:11] our inheritance yes
[52:13] right the Greek word dxa means Glory
[52:17] Splendor preeminence and magnificence
[52:19] how can we share this we sharing it God
[52:23] is sharing his glory with us
[52:26] by allowing us to share his
[52:30] character am Hallelujah God's glory is a
[52:34] principal part of God's character
[52:38] yes and his goodness you remember when
[52:41] Moses asked Show Me Your Glory what did
[52:42] he said I'll let all my goodness pass
[52:44] before
[52:46] you
[52:48] right so to share his glory is to share
[52:50] his
[52:52] character and the life that he wants to
[52:54] share with obedient Sons and Daughters
[52:56] of
[52:58] God so the grace that abides in US is
[53:02] the revelation of Christ's good
[53:05] goodness I want you to understand this
[53:07] now I want you to understand this very
[53:09] important if you didn't hear anything I
[53:11] said this morning hear
[53:13] this because of the abundance of your
[53:17] Revelation that's revealed to you in
[53:19] this hour that is God's glory oh thank
[53:23] you
[53:24] Lord
[53:25] hear me
[53:26] again the Hidden Mysteries that are
[53:29] revealed to us is God's glory being
[53:32] revealed to us amen his mind being
[53:35] revealed to us yes amen he's sharing his
[53:37] glory with us amen yes Lord hallelujah
[53:41] the grace that abides in US is the
[53:43] revelations of Christ goodness if you
[53:45] abide in him his revelation will
[53:48] instruct you in holy living it'll teach
[53:50] you Mercy Grace tenderness
[53:53] forgiveness characteristics of Christ
[53:56] am thank you so when God Reveals His
[53:59] goodness he's showing his glory to Moses
[54:02] right similarly when God Reveals His
[54:04] Hidden Mysteries and shows us the
[54:06] thoughts he had in the back part of his
[54:08] mind from before the foundation of the
[54:10] world he is revealing his glory and
[54:13] sharing his glory with us give God
[54:15] praise come on
[54:17] now we become the glory of the Lord
[54:20] revealed in
[54:22] creation what am I saying
[54:26] his glory is spoken of in the word
[54:30] right and His glory is spoken of as
[54:34] Revelation
[54:36] form but the understanding at the end
[54:39] time is that his glory will become
[54:42] personified his glory will be seen yes
[54:46] his glory will become tangible his glory
[54:49] will become manifested and personified
[54:52] in a person called The Bride of the Lord
[54:54] Jes Jesus
[54:56] Christ the church is the bride the woman
[54:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ as a woman who
[55:01] is the glory of God the bride becomes
[55:04] the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[55:05] this time when God ask us to be like him
[55:09] take his nature come into His Image and
[55:11] likeness and have his character that is
[55:14] him sharing his glory with
[55:16] us

[56:28] hallelujah amen I've got such beautiful
[56:32] advice for the young people here and
[56:34] we'll see if I can get to it very
[56:35] quickly he says the True Church of
[56:37] Christ not this now next the True Church
[56:40] of Christ the bride he so sold out to
[56:42] him and his promised word till the very
[56:45] mind that's in Christ is in you right
[56:48] this is his glory now his character
[56:50] being revealed in
[56:51] you next he says she's pregnated by the
[56:54] word word of God and will bring forth
[56:56] the body the finished body of Jesus
[56:59] Christ which is the bride the body of
[57:02] Christ isn't finished yet how many knows
[57:04] that a man and woman is one and Christ
[57:07] is one body the word the bride will have
[57:09] to be the rest of that body and the two
[57:11] together makes this one body again like
[57:14] Adam was in the beginning man his wife
[57:16] are one now she the true bride so sold
[57:19] out to him she has no mind of her own
[57:22] his mind of course is his will and his
[57:24] will is his word
[57:27] amen character there was never a
[57:30] character like Jesus Christ it lives in
[57:32] you you see what he's saying the
[57:34] character of Jesus which is his glory
[57:36] lives in you manifest him we see it
[57:39] through it's not worldly beauty of him
[57:41] that attracts the bride his bride it's
[57:43] his character the character of the
[57:45] church that Jesus looks for
[57:49] amen he's looking for her character the
[57:53] character of Christ now just in moment
[57:55] that's it he chooses a bride to reflect
[57:57] his character when he saying character I
[58:00] want you to replace a word with Glory
[58:02] because he's no his glory is no
[58:04] different from his character his glory
[58:06] is no different from his
[58:10] nature I'm trying to show you as well in
[58:12] the natural when you're looking for a
[58:14] wife what to look for character that's
[58:17] your
[58:20] glory he chooses the bride to reflect
[58:22] his character to which the modern Church
[58:24] of today certainly misses his program
[58:27] here a million miles now he's looking
[58:29] for the day for that bride to be formed
[58:31] Hebrews 13:8 just exactly like it like
[58:34] he was it's got to be the same flesh
[58:37] same bones Same Spirit same everything
[58:40] just built exactly built up and then two
[58:43] then become one until the church becomes
[58:46] that they're not one the character of
[58:48] him the word for this age must be molded
[58:51] she must be molded like he is amen amen
[58:56] when we come into his character and
[58:58] likeness and In His Image then we are
[59:01] displaying the glory of God then he will
[59:03] share his glory with us amen now give
[59:07] the Lord a good Anup of
[59:08] Praise because that is the end of that
[59:12] sermon and I will very quickly I have to
[59:15] do this for the young people some people
[59:17] are are hungry now for this word here I
[59:20] promise you I'll go through it very
[59:22] quickly right Hal Hallelujah we started

[59:51] there's only three files in that folder
[59:53] Sunday a.m. amen praise the
[59:57] Lord so first thing between man and
[1:00:00] woman there must be mutual
[1:00:04] attraction everybody agree there must be
[1:00:08] mutual
[1:00:10] attraction remember what we said now
[1:00:12] when God gave man a wife he gave him the
[1:00:14] best thing he could give him outside of
[1:00:16] Salvation right why am I saying mutual
[1:00:20] attraction it's in the word what the
[1:00:21] prophet is saying now see what he says
[1:00:23] first there must be mutual attraction
[1:00:25] right between boy and girl male and
[1:00:27] female but the word of God attracts the
[1:00:29] bride of Christ amen right he's saying
[1:00:33] the word of God attracts the bride of
[1:00:35] Christ so what is attracting Us in the
[1:00:37] spiritual oh yes to him the word and
[1:00:40] what he saying the bride attracts the
[1:00:42] attention of God by doing
[1:00:44] what keeping the word so that you see
[1:00:48] that mutual
[1:00:49] attraction amen
[1:00:52] amen the bride is attracted by the word
[1:00:54] of God and she attracts God's attention
[1:00:57] by keeping the word right now he says
[1:01:00] you know you have to
[1:01:04] plan
[1:01:07] look and
[1:01:10] pray I'm giving you very practical
[1:01:12] advice from the prophet
[1:01:13] now you have to do what
[1:01:17] plan so you must be a man with a
[1:01:23] plan you you have to
[1:01:26] look that we don't have to tell them
[1:01:28] they're very good at
[1:01:30] that right some people have very good
[1:01:33] poker faces here for the sub very good
[1:01:37] poker faces they won't give anything
[1:01:39] away I don't want to look around amen
[1:01:43] praise the
[1:01:45] Lord and
[1:01:47] pray you see you can't plan and look and
[1:01:50] then don't pray what is the prophet
[1:01:52] saying you have to plan
[1:01:56] look and pray this even though you're
[1:01:59] handling that computer brother Joshua
[1:02:01] this is for you as well
[1:02:03] right you have
[1:02:06] to
[1:02:07] plan look and
[1:02:11] pray
[1:02:14] okay then he goes on to say the only way
[1:02:17] in that you can now choose is to look
[1:02:19] for
[1:02:20] character and then if you love her amen
[1:02:28] ah I thought I must L
[1:02:32] first what is the prophet saying the
[1:02:35] only way you could
[1:02:37] choose first look for character then if
[1:02:40] you L
[1:02:45] fine I know you're going to be very
[1:02:47] quiet Young People amen praise the
[1:02:50] Lord let's all the people who already
[1:02:52] settled down and already made it and
[1:02:54] it's until death to you part let's say
[1:02:56] amen for them amen amen
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:00] hallelujah now again the natural bride
[1:03:03] types of spiritual she was made for the
[1:03:05] man not man made for her right now he
[1:03:08] says you can't have all things there
[1:03:10] might be one girl that's real pretty and
[1:03:13] the other girl maybe a stature looks
[1:03:15] better than this one you might have to
[1:03:17] sacrifice one for the other and I'm
[1:03:20] thankful yeah the brothers didn't have
[1:03:21] to sacrifice there they got both and the
[1:03:24] brother
[1:03:28] said praise the
[1:03:31] Lord stay with me you'll get good lunch
[1:03:34] Brothers come on
[1:03:35] [Music]
[1:03:37] now you might have to sacrifice one for
[1:03:40] the other but if she's not the statue of
[1:03:42] a lady or a woman I don't care whether
[1:03:44] she's pretty or not listen young people
[1:03:47] I don't care whether she's pretty or not
[1:03:49] you better look at a character whether
[1:03:51] she's pretty or
[1:03:53] not
[1:03:55] for nothing you must fight with
[1:03:58] her
[1:04:00] Hello to see a
[1:04:03] character cuz if she's coming there by
[1:04:05] house with the bush knife you better run
[1:04:06] [Music]
[1:04:10] boy don't wait till it's too
[1:04:13] late right he says don't look that she's
[1:04:18] just
[1:04:20] pretty or not pretty right and here the
[1:04:23] prophet said says now in the message
[1:04:25] kinsman redeemer When a Man Loves a
[1:04:27] Woman and marries her because she's just
[1:04:29] pretty there'll be an end to
[1:04:32] that but when a man finds a woman that
[1:04:35] he loves he don't know why but he loves
[1:04:37] her she finds a man that she loves no
[1:04:40] matter what he looks like so don't think
[1:04:42] you look too awesome you see what the
[1:04:43] prophet is giving advice for the woman
[1:04:45] no matter what he looks
[1:04:50] like she loves him that's an eternal
[1:04:54] made in glory death nor nothing else can
[1:04:56] ever separate them because they are from
[1:04:59] eternity they stepped out into space of
[1:05:01] time and will return back to Eternity
[1:05:04] eternity dropped down in a body called
[1:05:06] time then goes right back up to Eternity
[1:05:10] again it cannot
[1:05:12] perish praise the Lord don't keep
[1:05:15] telling your wife you know all wrongs
[1:05:16] will be made right
[1:05:17] there because she can tell you the same
[1:05:20] thing praise the
[1:05:22] Lord now yeah we're going to end very
[1:05:24] quickly now I don't have much notes I'm
[1:05:26] just giving you some practical advice
[1:05:28] here the kind of woman that a man would
[1:05:30] choose will reflect his Ambitions and
[1:05:34] character very important when brother
[1:05:36] Bram is referencing this its meaning is
[1:05:41] Glory will reflect a man's Ambitions and
[1:05:44] character that's Glory I put that in
[1:05:45] Brackets if a man chooses the wrong
[1:05:48] woman it reflects his
[1:05:50] character what he ties himself to shows
[1:05:53] truly what's in
[1:05:55] him a woman reflects what's in the man
[1:05:58] when he chooses her for
[1:06:00] wife it CHS what's down in him no matter
[1:06:03] what he says outside watch what he
[1:06:05] married and then in brackets I put
[1:06:08] because she is a reflector of his
[1:06:11] glory
[1:06:12] right if a Christian would choose a wife
[1:06:15] he ought to choose a genuine Born Again
[1:06:18] woman regardless of what she looks like
[1:06:22] it's what she is what makes her and then
[1:06:25] again that reflects his own Godly
[1:06:28] character and reflects what's in his
[1:06:30] mind what's going to be in the future
[1:06:32] for his family will be raised by such a
[1:06:35] woman for the future plans for his home
[1:06:38] reflects his glory
[1:06:40] again praise the
[1:06:42] Lord now very quickly we come back to
[1:06:44] the spiritual side when you see a church
[1:06:46] that's in the world acts like the world
[1:06:48] anticipating like the world partaking of
[1:06:50] the world counting God's Commandments as
[1:06:52] he never wrote them you can can imagine
[1:06:54] Christ ain't going to take a bride like
[1:06:56] that could you imagine a modern church
[1:06:58] today for a bride not my Lord I could
[1:07:01] hardly see that remember man and wife is
[1:07:04] one would you join yourself to a person
[1:07:06] like that if you would it would
[1:07:08] certainly kind of disappoint my faith in
[1:07:10] you then how about God joining himself
[1:07:13] to something like that a regular
[1:07:14] denominational prostitute you think he
[1:07:16] would do it having a form of godliness
[1:07:19] but denying the power he would never do
[1:07:21] it she must have his character in the
[1:07:25] true genuine Born Again Church must have
[1:07:27] the character that was in Christ because
[1:07:29] the husband and wife are one if Jesus
[1:07:32] did only that which pleased God kept his
[1:07:34] word and manifested his word his bride
[1:07:36] will have to be the same kind of
[1:07:38] character she could not by no means be a
[1:07:41] denomination no matter how much you want
[1:07:43] to say no she's controlled by a board
[1:07:45] somewhere that tells her what to do and
[1:07:47] can't do right many times a million
[1:07:50] miles off the true word it's too bad we
[1:07:52] ever got away from the true leader that
[1:07:54] God left us to lead the church he never
[1:07:56] sent State presbyter Bishops Cardinals
[1:07:59] priests popes he sent the Holy Ghost for
[1:08:01] the church to lead the
[1:08:05] church right when the when he the Holy
[1:08:08] Ghost is come he will lead you into all
[1:08:10] truth reveal these things to you that I
[1:08:12] have told you bring them to your
[1:08:14] remembrance and show you things to come
[1:08:16] the Holy Spirit was to do that the
[1:08:18] modern Church hates that they don't like
[1:08:20] it so how could God how could she be
[1:08:24] bride of
[1:08:25] Christ the people today is choosing a
[1:08:28] modern denomination poor understanding
[1:08:30] of the word so here I'm closing now this
[1:08:33] is my last quote do you know the fall
[1:08:35] came by woman at the beginning the end
[1:08:38] is going to wind up the same way women
[1:08:40] coming into Authority ruling over men
[1:08:42] and so forth you know the scripture says
[1:08:44] that you know the day she puts on man's
[1:08:46] clothes Bobs her hair all those things
[1:08:48] are contrary to God's word you know she
[1:08:51] represents the church amen praise the
[1:08:57] Lord when you watch what women are doing
[1:08:59] you'll see what the church is doing
[1:09:01] that's exactly
[1:09:03] right the True Church of Christ the
[1:09:05] bride is so sold out to him as his
[1:09:08] promised word till the very mind that's
[1:09:10] in Christ is in
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:13] you now if the sisters are wondering
[1:09:15] where what part do I play in all of this
[1:09:17] you only told me about a man
[1:09:19] choosing yes that's right because a man
[1:09:22] chooses and you have the right to say
[1:09:24] yes or
[1:09:26] no don't just accept the first guy that
[1:09:28] comes to you check him
[1:09:31] out ask him how's your relationship with
[1:09:35] the
[1:09:36] Lord because that's your spiritual
[1:09:38] leader now don't let them lie to you
[1:09:40] after you get married they won't bring
[1:09:41] you to
[1:09:44] church after you married you have to
[1:09:45] come to church alone is that what you
[1:09:49] want after you married you're sitting
[1:09:51] and crying now you go make it your
[1:09:54] parents a day Choose
[1:09:57] Wisely accept amen wisely make the right
[1:10:01] choices amen I know all the sisters here
[1:10:04] can say they made the perfect choice
[1:10:06] they gave the perfect yes the married
[1:10:09] sisters amen all the brothers ask the
[1:10:14] perfect question will you marry me and
[1:10:17] all the sisters gave the perfect answer
[1:10:19] and said yes praise the Lord and believe
[1:10:22] it by faith amen hallelujah amen
[1:10:27] hallelujah greet your brother sister say
[1:10:29] God bless you I pray you enjoy the word
[1:10:31] of

[1:10:37] fights here than anything and solving
[1:10:39] problems here okayy everybody's
[1:10:42] [Music]
[1:10:44] got I may have to come do marriage
[1:10:46] counseling afterwards amen but you
[1:10:48] appreciate the word of the Lord the word
[1:10:50] of the Lord is true if we stay according
[1:10:53] to the biblical pattern I'm trying to
[1:10:54] show you that man glory is
[1:10:58] woman man's glory is woman so Brothers
[1:11:02] we all ought to do better see I'm
[1:11:04] including myself in this we all ought to
[1:11:06] do better because woman is the reflector
[1:11:09] of man's
[1:11:10] glory and all the men said amen
[1:11:14] hallelujah so the biblical pattern is
[1:11:17] wives submit yourselves to your own
[1:11:19] husbands husbands love your wives even
[1:11:22] as Christ loved the church and gave
[1:11:25] himself for her so it's a sacrificial
[1:11:27] love let's all stand together not too
