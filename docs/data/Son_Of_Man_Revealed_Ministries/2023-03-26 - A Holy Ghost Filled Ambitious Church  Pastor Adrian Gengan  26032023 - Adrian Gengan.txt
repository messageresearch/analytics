know the exact date but this is when he defied death the only man to have defiled death and he was no ordinary man he was a God man amen he said destroy this Temple and in three days I shall raise it up again amen so Easter serves as a reminder that there's an empty tomb amen that he is alive and where is he living tonight this morning he's living inside you and I amen and that's the promise we

week I'm just back this week amen so I'm welcoming you back amen and we thank the Lord for his Supernatural hand we shared the testimony already amen about the supernatural hand of God oh and protection over their lives amen and we know it was the angel of God protecting them amen so let's stand this morning for the reading of his word amen let's turn to Colossians chapter 3 and verse verse one to four Colossians chapter 3 1-4 says since then you have been raised with Christ this morning it says since then Europe is worth Christ said above not Earthly Ambitions where Christ is seated at the right hand of God set your mind on things above not on Earthly things for you died and your life is now hidden with Christ in God when Christ who is your life appears then you you're with him 14. he says forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the eye calling of God in Christ Jesus notice these verses now put your heart on things apart mind on things about press forward everything is forward amen scripture in First Corinthians 9 4 says they would run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain amen so having a ambition that you're going to win the race and every man that striving for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beat the air so Paul is telling you that he has an ambition amen and this morning we'll speak on a holy ghost filled ambitious Church thanks to the reading of his word amen hallelujah amen now the problem of God tells us that when God speaks to a man he equips that man with faith amen and he has ambition this is a quote now from the prophet of God he says when God speaks to a man he has faith he has ambition and he has a purpose he goes up when God speaks to a man he gives him Faith to do it to accomplish or to achieve what his purpose in life is what God called him to do and he called us to be in the Church of God amen amen amen have you heard the voice of God in this last days amen come out of all my people then he's giving you Faith he's giving you an ambition and he's given you a purpose amen we are to be the most purpose-driven people on the face of the Earth we are not to be living idle lives but we ought to be a Holy Ghost Field ambitious Church and the only way that you can get a holy ghost fill the ambitious church is to have ambitious people men who are not just sitting around and saying oh we'll see where the message takes us no the message has come to equip you all creation is growing to see what the god he says you've got to press through you've got a battle to fight you're going through mind battles you're going through problems and strife and stress in this life you need to overcome these things amen but man has to surrender the prophet goes out to say this is coming from the message a prisoner he says man has to surrender every ambition he's got everything that he is everything his life his soul his body his will Ambitions everything else and becomes a complete a prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God amen so we can't run this Christian race based on our own ambition human Ambitions and that's what's the problem that entering the church because amen he says God before he could get the man in his hand he has to strip him of his ambition he has to strip him of all his training amen Hallelujah so people are highly driven and ambitious to accomplish worldly ambitions you'll see it in the world today be all that you can be you can become anything you can be but we are not focusing this morning sermon on Earthly things amen there's enough motivation to speak out there his life amen you know that and if you are dedicated to that ambition I put into it is your life but all of our Earthly accomplishments mean nothing in the kingdom of God amen we are happy for you if you've got a doctorate we're happy you know what your doctorate means you can earn more money to take care of your family but make sure you're a good amen caregiver at home make sure you are taking care of your family amen we are happy for you got a job but that holds very little value in the kingdom of God amen God is not impressed a degree that's not hoses in the air thinking that we have some status in this life put some ugly achievement yes yes amen I'm thinking everyone was bother to my doctorate amen the only thing that pleases God is Faith in his word thank you Lord amen how about you get adulthood in faith amen how about you get adopted in the Holy Ghost amen seek ye first the kingdom of God Amen Jesus says in Matthew 6 24 no man can serve two masters either will hate the one and love the other for he will be devoted to the one and despise the other he says you cannot serve God and Mammon money oh this is not for me this morning change your mind it is for you I'm talking to you the one that's saying it's not for you I'm talking about one who's ducking and Diving and not coming to church I'm talking directly to you you're a dismissed to the kingdom of hold you into his kingdom and it's any man that puts his hand to the plow and turns and walks away is not worthy of the kingdom of God he goes on to rebuke them and say you who can't stop devils in my name is here Lord you say I'll say depart from you me you workers of iniquity I never knew you amen hallelujah what are we doing trying to pull you from the groups of hell you're going to die in your condition if you don't surrender your life to the Lord Jesus Christ amen Satan is not called the god of any other age but he's called the God of this evil age amen oh I'm highly ambitious yes Satan was ambitious Satan was ambitious he wanted to be like the most high because he's got the people of the earth bowing down before him he is the God of this evil age amen we read about Abraham's life and how he was a pilgrim and a stranger to the world but he had an ambition to find the city whose building and make it was God Amen he'd just lay around in Babylon when he heard the call he responded to the call if you can hear the voice of God this morning respond to the call this morning amen lead your worldly Ambitions and follow after the Ambitions of God because the land that he will lead you to is Flowing with milk and honey amen Hallelujah something struck Abraham's heart he caught a hold of God and he put his faith into action he wasn't just floating around without any purpose he had faith that there was a city whose build and make it was God an eternal City he had a purpose in life to find that place amen what is your purpose what is your ambition amen Moses had an ambition that he was walking towards amen and he was never the same after that he had an ambition to do something and he was working towards fulfilling that purpose amen and he had a faith to do it he made that good push it and he had it amen he was equipped sweet in his heart and he went out there took God his service according to his will and they were the children of Israel amen even our lord Jesus was ambitious amen Jesus was ambitious he had a purpose to do the will of the father God has selected amen the prophet says God has selected the man for the age and selected the message even the nature of the man that would go over in that age amen so God has selected you for this age God put that nature in you because he knew you're going to overcome this age amen all people think hey God called me into the message to have some mighty Revelation and do nothing about it you think knowledge chapter 17 not ever reveal anything and the church sits still the church was always be on the Move amen the church has got an ambition to move forward but what do we find today we find the message churches dying we find people dying in the message churches no move of God no fire of God amen what we need is another Holy Ghost not pouring then we can get rid of all of the ungodliness in our lives then we can stop saying amen oh nobody's perfect God had called you to be perfect in this hour God has called you to raise up another standard in this hour yes you know why we say those things it's because we want to continue living in sin but when the Holy Ghost comes and fills you up he has called you the profession you lay down your worldly desires you lay down the things of this life and you take up your cross and you follow Jesus don't sit down in the house of God give him praise this morning one two of God cannot move because you are entering the spirit of God right there I shall not be I shall not be moved that's why the spirit of God cannot move when I say the message Church The Message Church is full of individuals and I'm not preaching to any other church I'm preaching to this church the Church of the Holy Spirit with individuals you cannot come into the house with the Lord and have no praise all right amen amen how can you you want to just sing the song I'm blessed going in I'm blessed going out you're not blessed if you got no Praise You are not blessed amen what time is it well the service finished quickly today Let the Fire of God why does the Holy Ghost you know what John all right but they don't want it's gonna burn Fire's gonna people want an intellectual Holy Ghost tell me more about the certain seals amen Hallelujah Christ had an ambition he was driven with ambition to fulfill his purpose amen hallelujah they tried to stop the purpose of Jesus amen but he told them don't you know I must be about my father's business amen yes amen are you a father's business God doesn't call people with no ambition when he called David he was tending sheep on the backside of the desert and there in the backside of the desert he began to have Supernatural experiences on God's training ground he was killing the lion and he was killing the bed God was giving him Supernatural experiences so when he had time to face the giant he had already had Supernatural encounters [Music] when God Called Moses he was telling jet plus flock he wasn't sitting idly he was working when God called his eye he was serving in the temple when God called Samuel he was serving under Eli when God called Elisha he was working and serving and Elijah when God called Peter he was working in a fishing business but Jesus told him so lazy [Music] Jesus didn't sit around and be idle when the time and when the season came 30 years he waited but he was being trained amen when the right time and season came around yes he got to work and when the work was finished on the cross and he rose again he didn't just sit around and say Church rest I've done it all do nothing but he instructs the 12. and he tells him Jesus asked them to pick up the mantle Jesus tells him and he puts the church under Commission amen and he tells him yeah in Matthew 28 verse 18 Jesus came and spake unto them all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go in therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you in love I am with you always even unto the end of the world oh I can just imagine someone say oh Jesus what have you done now you said you're going to pay the price of redemption now you're putting all the work on to me you're telling me to go into the world you're telling me to go and preach you see how God put man as part of the Redemption plan you and I ever want to play and if we are not carrying out the commission then we are not fulfilling God's purpose the Bible says through the foolishness of preaching the gospel he has chosen to save man amen he also told him to tarry now he told them go and preach gospel everybody yes amen I tell you if you've really been filled with the Holy Ghost you wouldn't be sitting like how you're sitting right now no way not in God's economy not only those real people because if I take you to the book of Acts and I'll show you how Holy Ghost Fields Sons and Daughters begin to operate in the spirit begin to move in the spirit and we examine that and patent it with our lives because the Holy Ghost has the same nature the Holy Ghost has the same signs the Holy Ghost has the same wonders fruit you can hide the seed put it in the ground and tell everyone I have Holy Ghost seed I've got message of the our seed but it's summertime it's time to move food bearing time when we see the fruits on the tree it's going to expose what seed was wrong if it's a Pentecostal experience that's what's gonna come forth in fruit bearing time if it's a Baptist experience that's what's going to come talking through bearing time but if it's the message of the hour it is Purity amen and the spoken word is the Original Seed amen fruit bearing time it must produce Sons and Daughters who have possessed the power of the spoken word oh come on give God a praise amen hallelujah to see the time church this is the season this is the hour for the outpouring of the Holy Ghost he says amen wait until the Dynamics strike the mechanics we've had the mechanics all these years but this is the season for the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and he said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost do you want it a double portion anointing a many many men he says don't you see the church is dead why he says there's no more ambition in the church for lost souls you read it don't you see the church is dead and he's not placing it on any other thing he says there's no ambition for lost souls there's no ambition for Matthew 28 19. there's no ambition for Revelation 10 11. but one time the Holy Ghost is fought upon us Sons and Daughters rise up to their potential Sons and Daughters rise up to the ambition of Christ amen it's a new season for the church it's a new experience amen when the Holy Ghost comes think of the day of Pentecost it was a new experience they lost all shyness they could begin to get bold they begin to get Fearless God is worth you know this word amen you know that to be the truth what you doing man amen recognize your part of the word and go on to fulfill your part of the scripture we cannot feel it fulfill another man's scripture why are you hearing me this morning we cannot fulfill another man's scripture we cannot fulfill things that pertain to brother Branham you cannot fulfill brother Brandon's Ministry brother Branham at his part he fulfilled it well amen you must look for your own scriptures to fulfill your own part stop looking at another man's Ministry and Lasting after his gift God hasn't called you for that God has called you in the body of Christ and God knows what he is doing he's placed you effectively to work in his kingdom operating the ambition and your potential amen God will play for it amen scripture will be impersonation I need more produce any results but when we get the revelation of the part of the world that we must fulfill in this day nothing can stop it the doubt can stop it in your life amen amen when it's your season nothing can stop it amen just says nothing gets stuck they're coming on of a new season amen even the deadness and the coldness of winter that declares everything is dead foreign [Music] former lukewarm church is over because it's springtime again the holy ghosts are pouring again amen Hallelujah everything that was dead in winter is coming back to life and nothing can stop it amen nothing can stop you from your purpose you are unstoppable amen turn to your neighbor this morning and tell them you are unstoppable amen amen amen tell him this is your season amen the Holy Ghost In You Speak Now Speak Life the Holy Ghost In You will put a new season in you [Music] amen do you believe it yes one thing to believe it do you receive it amen give God praise amen hallelujah nothing nothing stop your purpose nothing can hold you back people may try to suppress you amen people may not be happy about you amen bursting forth into life people may not be happy about the supernatural taking place in your life people will try and discourage you I said oh brother I think you are beside yourself well then let's let the people fight myself amen [Music] amen nothing no one could separate you from your vision or purpose in Christ hear what the prophet of God says I'm not making these things up he says here the Church of the Living God is built time on high ambitions this church must have high Ambitions amen we can't be satisfied with a minor outpouring we want the fullness of the our Glory if nobody else wants it we sing this morning we wanted Lord if nobody else is desirous we are saying we wanted Lord the church must be built on high Ambitions he says when I hear of a church that hasn't got any ambition to grow there's something wrong with their Church the Church of the Living God has a high ambition amen now whenever I'm preaching spiritually you can apply it to your natural life have an ambition one time there's a man living in a shack and all he has is a chin check around him but he has an ambition and a vision even though he's sitting in a shack he has a vision of himself sitting in a house one day Hallelujah he has a vision of himself joining a car one day amen and man with his natural abilities and the natural laws that God has placed on the earth he has enough Faith to raise himself from the condition of 18 Shack and is now living in a three-bedroom house he's now driving a car I'm telling you the natural that's why God says seeking first the kingdom because man on the earth naturally copies the things from the kingdom of God have an ambition even in your own life yourself amen but don't let it overtake the ambition of Christ he said that another thing the Church of the Living God is built high because it got high anticipation and expectation do you have an expectation yeah oh no no no that was a weak one that didn't sound like you had an expectation he asked do you have an eye anticipation do you have an eye expectation amen he says well we belong to church Our Father served in the church years ago that might be fine but the Church of the Living God can shift still amen oh brother eating why don't you just continue and let things remain as we were just come and preach some intellectual gospel here no the Church of God hands yet still amen yes I will not stand to see the message die out amen now we're not scared to see this young man of God young daughters of God not receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and just receive the intellectual part of the message we say no Sons and Daughters must be filled amen Hallelujah it says the Church of the Living God can't say it still it's ambition is to go higher and further take me back take me back dear Lord but I press forward what they had back then was good but I'm telling you what lies ahead is greater amen it's more powerful are you looking forward to it amen amen what they had back there was good it was great but this is another season and I'm under great expectation of what he's going to do even in this church amen what we've been seeing and witnessing in the Supernatural amen is just it it's more portion of his outpouring I'm expecting greater testimony I'm expecting a greater outpouring amen Hallelujah listen to what the problem of God says if you think my vision and my ambition is not aligned to what the prophet is saying he says we see the blind heal today but we don't stop there hear what he says we watch him tomorrow for the death to be raised Hallelujah we see you heal from your sugar diabetes we've seen you heal from your high blood pressure amen but we are expecting to see the resurrection of the Dead Hallelujah can I get a witness can I get somebody to catch the mission amen the church doesn't sit still it has a high ambition he says we see the blind heal today we're watching tomorrow for the death to be raised we see nature obey his voice we're looking there for the coming of Christ so what is he saying the church is never settled on an experience Hallelujah you know even in this day you know when the prophecy breaks out in the church and even other times have been spoken you watch how the people going to a frenzy they do not handle the move of God have you ever noticed how the prophet handles it calm cool thank you Lord for the word moves on we are not accustomed to it people go into a frenzy people don't know what to make of it we're going to know how to operate in the things of God amen it says it's Ambitions is high the anticipation is high amen its expectations is high it's built high it sits as a memorial oh my prayer this morning is that you will raise up your expectation you'll raise up your anticipation and you will raise up your ambition and set your mind on things above amen hallelujah aren't you glad that we are not living amen of the experience of our fathers and our forefathers we do not have to point them back to the book of Acts and show the supernatural workings of God neither do we have to point in the days of the Apostles and show the supernatural workings of God neither do we have to point to the days of brother Branham to show the supernatural workings of God but this bride has their own experiences in Christ we have had our own Supernatural experiences where he has grown he is Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen thank you oh Hallelujah you say oh why are you excited I know what I'm preaching about I know the power of the one who is standing here right now amen hallelujah you can raise up to the expectation nothing shall stand before you all the days of your life amen amen only bill has swung and be thou courageous we need a few courageous men and a few courageous women who are not afraid to take God at his word amen and walk out but what if you don't do it it's not my reputation at stake Lord It's Your word I'm gonna apply the word and go forward amen we need rugged men and women of God who are not afraid to take God in this world amen hallelujah amen we serve a present tense God not a god of the yesterday he's the same yesterday today and forever God has not grown tired and weary after 6 000 years it's not a six thousand year old God who's weary and Powerless amen he's just as powerful today as you was on the first day when he said let there be and he created the heavens and the Earth be still a healing Jesus he's still The God Who can speak to the winds and the waves and they obey he can speak to the mountains and they move he can open blinded eyes he can deliver captives he can take you out of prison this morning he can take you out of your dead tomb this morning amen good prison doors open the Holy Ghost pin you we become co-workers with the Holy Ghost amen can you rise up to that expectation can you rise up to it you know what I found amen hallelujah if we sit still nothing happens because usually these things happen when there's a need the power of God on display if you sit in your house behind your foreclosed walls your doors closed nothing will happen step out onto the Evangelical field one day step out of your house and you see somebody in need amen silver and gold ever now you know when Peter and John were in the temple that day they could have been rejoicing around the scriptures we can all Rejoice around the world but once we step out of this place yes recognize who you are amen you carry an anointing amen you carry the Holy Ghost In You amen silver and gold am I None but such as I have give I unto thee Amen in the name of Jesus rise up and walk amen amen I speak against that Spirit of blindness in the name of Jesus Christ I speak against that Spirit of blindness through diabetes in the name of Jesus Christ amen yes and I rebuke that spirit in the mighty name of Jesus scientists God has accepting conditions if I said get a little gym we run to the optometrist come on now somebody optometrists didn't have them if our hearing gets a little weak we buy a hearing aid we are killing the move of God the one that was equipped with amen sent to equip the church make the church a supernatural Church who's the best specialist we know we start asking for recommendation but but I want to know who's a specialist in this field his name is Jesus he's the best specialist he's the only specialist you need you say but I hate somebody but he specializes in that how can this one person specialize in all things amen because he is the great physician and he now is near amen hallelujah he's the one who made man he created every organ in man he put the bread of God into man and he knows how to heal man thank you not only the body the mind sometimes you get trouble in our mind and we don't know how to handle life depression free anxiety sets in God can heal you God can heal your heart but you gotta trust him you got to put your faith in this morning amen hallelujah oh he can touch you and he can heal you amen hallelujah he is looking for somebody who can take him at his word because when you take him at his word then all things are possible to them that believe he says the real Church of God is built with ambition that won't stop on any organization it believes in the power and the resurrection of Christ who saws Beyond these old chicken-ness that we have around here some chickens have the title message of the owl the chicken is but nothing but chicken is the prophet is you're going somewhere what you drifting for I'm ambitional some are like driftwood waiting for the next wave to push them have your ankle secured in Christ Jesus we are in the Eagles stereotypingest he says I haven't got much hopes for a pastor's church that hasn't got Ambitions to better themselves day by day oh isn't that what we're doing [Music] issue to get better and hereby here a church that a church God will never but you know what I'm just waiting for this this pastor to stop with this thing here and start another series because he's lighting a fire under me and he's making me and this person wants me to get spiritual what do you think of him he's telling me I'ma start praying and reading my Bible again hey I don't know what's wrong with that past he wants me to come to church all those things now listen to your prophet he says I haven't got much hope for a pastor's Church that hasn't got Ambitions to better themselves it's like thank you day by day a church that's rich of the Living God will never stop amen well I just come in I guess it's all right now that ain't the Church of God you see some of us came into church this morning oh I'm just gonna yeah I wonder who's going to preach today some of us have this wheel at home they got the names there they spoon the wheel I wish it's my favorite preacher I know I'm not your favorite preacher I wish it's my favorite preacher it says that in the Church of God is God an ambition to press on do you have a will to press on amen press forward into the things of God I don't understand that and I Now understand the prophet's quote when he says I don't understand how people of God can look beneath the Gods and you can sow into the heavenlies we want to live beneath our privileges yes he says well I've done my part I brought one sinner in this year and got saved hear what he says brother that's not the ambition of the Church of God if he brings one he wants another amen another another there's no end to it it just keeps on climbing up see we want to have an ambition and expectation God wants us to be that way amen one time you all know the story about the slave there was a son everybody from he was he captured with him and daily they were being beaten beaten the problem of God says they were sad slaves you know when somebody takes your will and your reason to live they knew that they were not going back to their Homeland so they didn't want to work they had no ambition so they would take whoops to put them to make them work he says about this one slave you didn't have to whoop him he didn't have to force him to work he had his chest out straight shoulders and he walked and they used to have these auctions where they used to sell off their slaves so a man comes by one day through that farm and he wants to buy this particular slate and the owner of the event says he is not for sale and he asked him why is he different from the other slaves do you feed him different treat him different as he sleep differently in a different place the owner says no he says I come to I had to question myself I come to find out that this man back in his own country his father is a king and though it's not in his own land he carries himself as a son of a King He Walks Like a son of a king amen so what is that he did not allow his enslaved condition to discourage him he was living above the conditions around him because he knew that if only the trumpet sounds one morning foreign of a king he had the potential to become king so he lived with that in mind that he was able to go free he's a king if you ever get free from this life when the chains of this life the Bible says if you overcome this age I will set you on my throne on this age amen the prophet says myest ambition and only ambition is to see Jesus Christ glorified I live for that how was Jesus glorified in brother prayer get what he is meaning now let the Lord Jesus Christ be glorified in your life even now don't say oh I can't wait for this pastor to finish I'm gonna go sort out my wife alone I'm going to sort out my husband I'm gonna sort out my child listen why don't you sort yourself on right now in his presence amen why don't you sort your attitude out right now in his presence it says let's just make it our purpose in life to see that we are the Church of God let's have ambition not sit around and do what the Joneses want do we care about I like this because the word got lost and they put a question mark so you can put anything in there okay what do we care about what the other message search if they don't do it let us do it anyway if the rest of the nation wants to sink that's up to them yeah in Phoenix we stand for God we want God we want to achieve do you want to achieve we want to have faith we want to have ambition let's believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for he said all things are possible to them that believe verily I say unto you but if you say to this mountain be moved and do not doubt in your heart but believe that what you said shall come to pass you can have what you said I believe that with all my heart you believe that amen he says here find your ambition have a purpose that you're going to be healed for the glory of God then come with faith that I'm going to receive it and you'll get it amen this morning as we draw to a close if there's any worldly ambition in US just worldly desires you know you know what I'm talking to now you're lying you're a message believer how you can talk so delicate I took my best clothes and I came today you're lying you're a message believer you know you don't have the life you don't live the life having any great worldly ambition repent of them right now have the grace enough to repent in his presence [Music] sorry that you wanted to be some great worldly person Lord my complete ambition is to be like Jesus Christ he says come meekly humbly then when you put your hands upon his head and by faith confess your sin Lord I'm sorry Adana then what will happen God will transfer all your guilt over on him and take your innocence and put it back on you and you stand justified in the presence of God because you believed in Jesus Christ his son what a Plan of Salvation then you share in his glory the goodness of God will come into your heart the power of his resurrection will make you a new person it will satisfy every about this maybe you lost your focus maybe you thought hey now I want you to understand why is God choosing to do a new thing when I say new thing the prophet says it is the rising of the son that the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost not that you didn't have the Holy Ghost he says we are waiting for the Dynamics but he said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling refilling of the Holy Ghost let me ask you this why is it coming in the 117th year you say what are you doing you got to be confused 1906 started the first church age this is the 117th year it equals the first church age Ephesus Church ran for 117 years this year 2023 117 years but we sit and not move when the prophet did tell us this will be a short age why why is the spirit speaking in this line and not only in this church but you'll find other churches spirit of God speaking in a way wake up check your oil check your oil amen people have been running with the wine drunk on the wine but they didn't check the oil you know what I'm talking about why mean stimulation of Revelation people have had wonderful revelations in the message they've been running with the wine but the Bible says hurt not the oil and the wine have you checked up your oil level have you checked up your own business is

about you amen the other side I was still thinking about the church amen what's going on you know it's really good we had some good experiences amen the week before we go and if you see the pictures you'll always say that you know what that was the grace of God Amen and the people all they looked at the pictures they said you know what this is unbelievable because people couldn't have come out of there and everybody thought that was a question it was over but we just thank God sometimes you know we need to pray hard amen and I do this every morning I pray for all my children I pray to the church and I pray for the church children that are going to school because I love you much amen being a minister of this gospel I've been preaching for 38 years I don't know what it is oh the devil

because they were so despondent but I just thank God that we cannot feed this one amen I wouldn't be too long I had a good trip I thought you'll never make it hmm it was my desire Creed about it and uh you know every time this thing would just come and just get sick and then cough and just carry on and said no I said Lord I'm taking you by your word amen I said I want to go there because I want to have that experience and the prophet said when you go there the Bible become a new book amen and that is how true it is and when we went down there it was just so beautiful it's original if you want to see a country that is blessed you go to Israel to see it kind of thing yeah 90 of the food comes out of their own country man the only importance is and you know when I saw it 365 days a year the hotels are full 365 days a year the the shops are catching their tools only one day is on a Saturday you don't find no action at all everything from Africa after four o'clock on a Friday in Jerusalem everything is quiet the zero percent is zero percent crime in the country I've seen Hawkins on the roadside got all the things that are kept in the uh in the places of uh of of business will not pack it back into a motor car to take it home they would just close it and they would just go you'll sign children's scooters lying on the roadside children lying on the roads nobody said you don't mess with the law in this country he says this country there's no nobody steals we're looking at high body walls border was the only best time not more than that that's the border wall and then they got the electric fence electric fences are even that high they're not more higher than that but they say if you just take a chance to come to that fence you must say goodbye to yourself and that is how powerful his security is you'll find policies everywhere visible politics policy invisible policy million final Army every day there's no way you're gonna find TV you know I've been to the to Jerusalem Jerusalem is actually completely sealed and you go inside it was just so wonderful I thought I'd never make it because there's so much more walking to do but I just want to praise God through your prayer amen amen and the prayer of the Saints I walk this journey I walked where Jesus walked amen I went to his tomb I went to his crucifixion and so Elijah's place of rest where he actually performed that that medical it was just some wonderful experience I went to assail the gallery it was just so wonderful you know there's so much that you can talk about it will take you the whole day but I just want to get to the point you know sometimes when we go out our first desire is to be to look for Souls amen otherwise we're wasting our time and purpose it's gone as a purpose for us and there's a desire to look for Souls and uh I was talking to people on the plane we left here talking to people on the plane and while we got on the other side we were still talking and they you know they noticed something different because it was just my wife that had long hair and it was I against that long pants and my wife was wearing a long dress and we were just looking so different from everybody else the other people started you know questioning things and we started to giving them answers but the highlight of everything was you know they wanted to know from as much difference that we are there we started to explain them and they understood and some people were making more queries all the time you know like trying to find out why is this band different why is that done different when the pastor gave me an opportunity to serve communities until we do foot washing and we take our wine you know the the actual wine is as a community he said okay let's do it and then uh we went to to to the birthplace of Jesus Christ and I mean the Tomb of Jesus Christ and we did a communion there I want to tell you it was an experience so the devil always have his ways they always want to come and kind of cut across everything that we do you know when we started the communion the rain started pouring we had to hold umbrellas and everybody holding umbrellas their winds started to blow and it was cold ice physical I thought I was going to come home with a pneumonia and I was very sick after that but anyway I preached on the communion and told them that uh this communion was not supposed to be taken during the day and after communing with this food washing party and you know while I was praying there was a sister you know sometimes if you don't recognize the Angels standing by the servant of God somebody else will see it somebody else will see it because I think we are too what you call used to that yeah you know we are so complacent there is nothing that seems real to us because that's how complacent we are because we have these basics for such a long time with your long dresses long hair leave the makeups but we don't want to see the supernatural yes and the people that want to see the supernatural have a desire in their hearts and we are the ones today you should be having the desire to see the supernatural because we are waiting for his coming amen and the prophet said this is not going to be a big show it's going to be a one-off thing and over and as I finish reading the word while I was praying I said you know and I stood up and said you know what the Eastern Angel standing right here and that is why we have to approach this very referently you know when I finish the service there was so much of rain everybody despair we had eight dishes to do this or I mean but there's one brother stood up he said you know what I never had experienced this in my life before I want to wash your feet and I want you to wash my feet amen for an example all those people that was you know it was I couldn't blame them some of them would have done it some of them wouldn't have done it but we're not forcing anybody but this brother said I'm going to do it now irrespect of the rain the brothers held the umbrella and we did the foot washing and the people just watched and it was an experience for other people and there's a sister she came up to me and she said you know what brother while you were standing there and he was while he was preaching I saw something that I never saw in all my life amen amen she saw she said she saw a cloud right behind amen and she saw a rainbow over there now I want to tell you something nobody told her about a cloud Amen in my Ministry I never said anything about a cloud nobody spoke about a rainbow but she saw a rainbow and a cloud amen and she just pondered whether she was in a vision or she was just standing and looking at something and as she said when she looked at that he saw a light just flash now my brother my sister there is something serious amen amen and she had so much of questions on the way he still got questions and another brother who stood right in the back and he had a doubt in his heart he said you know what this is something something a tradition and I explained the tradition to them also about the food funky and the rest of the things I explained that out for them this was not the food funky because this was a different occasion and then he said you know what I saw a cloud in the light nobody talk about cloud even during our our conversation we never spoke about cloud and another sister came up and she said you know what I saw this light flashing all the time you know I want to say sometimes don't want to accept that experience here that is why we cannot see it and the old brother came up and he said you know what I've never seen something like this he said that place behind where you were standing and the other brothers were standing he said it was just so lit up and the rain was pouring but the place was lit up he says how do I see these things I said my brother you have gifted me God has given you a gift that you could see something amen and then he came to me while we were going to buy something to eat you know it always wanted to come and talk to me and he came to me he said you know what I'm going to church for such a long time so addicted and I used to preach sometimes but I never knew I think the Bible so many times he says I never knew that the comedian might be taken at night he said I never read that he says he didn't read it I said no brother you read it but he didn't understand it this is what I want to tell you that your holiday should be a desire for Souls amen yes anywhere where you go in your desires God will hold you responsible for this message yes your behavior God is going to hold you responsible for this message amen your attitude God is in your holy responsible for you I want to tell you this morning this was a great experience for me if ever you think you want to go for a holiday you feel saved enough money it is not easy it's expensive if you ever saved enough money don't hesitate don't waste your time

about the word of God oh while you while you're doing this thing and he kept on contacting me regarding the foot washing and communion he even asked me like you know do you have a special day for this comedian I said obviously if you want to do the board you must have a special day you had a special meeting he said hey he says okay I'll keep talking to you praise the Lord you know that because you
