========================================

amen greetings in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen good to be found back in the house of the lord again amen let's turn to our scripture the book of matthew 13 amen hallelujah matthew 13 and verse 24 amen this is speaking about the parable of the sower and then after the soul went another reap a sower amen you went to sow seeds as well [Music] we'll read from verse 24 it says another parable putting forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man with sowed good seed in his field [Music] but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way so that's a man with no responsibility he just sold and he went amen but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so you see where he left his uh seed in the church so the servants of the outsolder came and said unto him sir does not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then added tears he said unto them and the enemy had done this the servant said unto him ruled out then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them look at father's love amen father will also take care of the chairs because he doesn't want to bring arm to his children let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather here together the first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my bun amen you may be seated hallelujah [Music] amen so for a little title we'll take a thought called aborting the seeds of discrepancy and bringing forth the seed of god amen aborting the seed of discrepancy and bringing forth the seed of god amen so from this parable we see that there are two sowers sorry i gotta hold this those i can't see my screen we learn that there are two souls in the field the good sower like we know is jesus the son of god who went forth sowing the word and the and an enemy the devil came up to him and sowed the seed of discrepancy amen [Music] with the kill once you get that set up this notes here you can follow along and an enemy now the devil we said so the seeds of discrepancy now we know this has happened through every age since the beginning of the garden of eden amen it's always been the case every time god came in on the scene the enemy came in on the scene amen so even in the garden now the garden of eden there types this parable that the lord jesus is talking about because we find two sowers in the field amen the serpent sowed his seed and adam sowed his seed hallelujah [Music] god told them not to break one word he told them every word must be kept they must live by that word not so now that's the beginning of the bible in the middle of the bible jesus tells us again that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes out of the mouth of god and then in the closing book of revelation he tells us whosoever shall take one word out of the book or add another one to it his part will be taken from the book of life now even though they disobeyed god's word and brought death to the human race god's solution now follow my thoughts two sowers went to sow the serpent sowed his seed adam sowed his seed but even though there were two seeds now in the bedding ground of eve god did not terminate the pregnancy amen abortion is not god's plan all of life on earth today came from god he is the source of life god values life and his plan of redemption is to preserve life amen he is restoring us back to our original condition god does not have a replacement policy god has a restoration policy amen he says i will restore save the lord amen amen now we find that if we can type our fleshly carnal nature brother branham calls this the first husband our first nature is the first husband and he and we can type it like that first nature being like cain in the flesh we are envious we are jealous and we want to be rewarded for the works of the flesh but he says we must die to the first nature amen now brother branham tells us here he labels to tell us do not divorce the first nature you know what happens when somebody gets divorced and remarried the first husband wants visitation rights so he always hangs around he always comes around now we don't want our first nature to come around amen there's no visitation rights for the first nature that first nature must die and we must be born again now satan could not stop abel and his revelation amen adam's true seed if if nobody knew that there was a serpent seed in the garden of eden just by watching these two boys adam's true seed would be revealed when it came time to worship jesus said to them let both grow but at hour's time it's easier to spot the tears from the wheat amen now we are in another hour's time and now is the time the father is seeking those two worshipers amen and when when it's time to seek true worshipers it will come back to the revelation amen the revelation of the one god will reveal who our father is amen week after week cain is going to church offering worship to a trinity of gods but abel is offering to the one true living god abel knows that god was condescending from spirit to word to flesh in order for us to go from flesh to word that's our theophany back to a glorified body a spiritual body amen now important thing the prophet is telling us in the invisible union of the bride of christ he says if we see the conduct of woman in the world today what are we doing we are looking at a natural type being a spiritual thing he says if you want to see what's happening in the church watch the women of the world watch the conduct of the worldly church today he says of course now there is also the conduct of the spiritual bride the church watch that also two people two women to watch amen watch the woman of the world so there's three women there if you notice watch the woman of the world the conduct of the worldly church and then there's the bride the spiritual bride he says because the natural so-called claim or to be bright also right he says notice this character when you see a woman go on the rampage not the men now watch the women when you see women just go on the rampage just doing anything they want to do the church is doing the same thing amen for as the world satan the deceiver who deceived the first bride to sinning against god by misbelieving his word and now today as we see the church natural in in your intellectual gospel going further and further away from the word a social gospel we find the woman of the world on the streets members of such carrying themselves in the in the same atmosphere you can't tell them they lost all sense of common decency the people have see and that's the way the church has and you can see it going straight to the economical council just as certain as anything in the world and right into rome as hard as it can go because it's prophesied and there she is that's her behavior what you're going somewhere with this now watch the behavior of the woman watch the natural women watch the depth they are typing the church carnal amen now our thought is aborting the seeds of discrepancy so what is going on with abortion rights at the moment that's big in the news you know june 24th what is abortion the killing of unborn babies you'll find roe v wade was overturned roe v wade is a case that was tried in the courts i think it was back in 1970 something 73 now it was overturned in 2022. many of you don't know what this means amen many of us have not do you know that 73 million babies are killed every year 73 million why what's the condition of the woman they don't want commitment they are aborting the seed yes because they do not want responsibility yes amen brother branham says they want to run around and party they've glamorized and sexualized women and made them nothing but a sex object and they'll go about saying this is my right the movement says my body my right our movement says it's his body and it's his right amount amen so we find roe v wade was overturned by the supreme court if you look at if you can see that he says i am a woman not a whom that first placard on top that woman is carrying she says i'm a woman not a whom but a woman means a wombed man do you know there's something going on in the u.s more especially that's a corrupt country they call it gender neutral they cannot define a woman anymore but last week they clearly defined what a woman was they forgot about gender neutral and everyone went crazy when they overturned this now they think we're a woman you take away our rights suddenly they know what a woman is look at the next picture they say we won't breathe for you but what was a woman given for yes the bible says she shall be saved through childbearing now in the first exodus we know they killed two years and under because they were afraid of the deliverer that was going to come they knew it would change their world order and disrupt the plans they had for the earthly kingdom exodus 1 15 you'll find the king of egypt pharaoh speaking to the hebrew midwives and telling them in verse 16 amen that if it be a son you shall kill him but if he'd be a daughter then she shall live and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born you shall cast into the river every daughter you shall save a life killing of children in the first exodus second exit the same thing eric ordering the killing matthew 2 16 you'll find he says eric when he saw he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wrath and sent forth and slew all the children that were in bethlehem and in the course they are from two years and under according to the time which he had diligently and quiet of the wise men and now we find in the third exodus mass killing of babies mass killing amen and nobody says anything about it so we find amen abortion is a woman refusing to accept the seed of a man to reproduce life and you'll find that brother branham says that a woman was given to a man to reproduce his life when god created man in the garden of eden he told him to multiply and replenish the earth so their objective is to go against god's word amen what is it showing us the condition of the natural woman is showing you the condition of the spiritual church world they also do not want to accept the seed word of god like the natural woman the natural woman wants to substitute babies for cats and dogs brother branham says because of that maternal instinct within her she'll nurture anything she'll mother anything so she puts clothes on a dog and refuses to raise a child because it'll disfigure her body yes she won't have the freedom to go where she wants to go amen and i prayed not so spiritually that we do not want to reproduce the life of christ because it will disfigure our bodies it will just figure our image that we want to portray to the world i don't want people to see me as a holy roller amen what are they doing amen they want substitutes like cats and dogs so to the church spiritual women once substitutes for the word of god they've taken creeds and dogmas to mother and their mother that creed and dogma instead of the word of god they will hold more precious they create in the dogma more than the word of god the natural is verse the spiritual type is showing us the condition that they are trying to stop the natural birth of children naturally they are trying to stop the birth of children but spiritually they are trying to stop the new birth amen now it didn't make abortion illegal in america because it can still be practiced but in certain states all they've done is overturn the decision so that each state can make their own laws right it doesn't mean that abortion is banned because yeah in south africa abortion is legal too the killing of the unborn is glorified and you know what even us we've all grown accustomed to it and there's no cry out against it amen it's become normalized people don't cry out against sin people don't cry against the justice for the unborn and they let laws be passed in the land amen hallelujah so women's rights groups are protesting abortion rights activist slogans are my right to choose and my body my right and that is the condition of the church spiritual they want to have their right about their church body they don't want all the word they pick and choose what portions of the world they want and they settle for blessings only they don't want the giver of the blessings what are they telling you they want a sea donor and they want nothing to do with the man called christ jesus they only want a donor didn't the book of assad tell us that they want they said give us your name only he says seven women will take hold of one man they want to adopt rather you find these women that have careers in hollywood they will rather go and adopt a african child but they can raise their own child they want to raise something that's not their own so to the church they are not raising their their own they have adopted a creed and a dogma in the catholic church system and everything that they have they adopted amen they adopt an experience of a day gone by yes amen and that's what they are trying to do in the message of the hour trying to adopt an experience of a day gone by jesus didn't die in 1965 jesus is alive he's the same yesterday today and forever the holy ghost didn't leave the earth in 1965 amen stop trying to take a church and given an experience from a day gone by amen hallelujah you'll find all kinds of isms rising up in the message but we must stay the course amen we must walk the line amen hallelujah amen oh we what are they doing they got an experience they've adopted an experience they don't want the word and the holy ghost give them their own experience and their own new birth every predestinated son and daughter of god will that will be born on the earth amen nothing can stop a predestinated son and daughter from being born on the earth no amount of abortion laws can stop god's predestination seed from coming forth yes amen nothing can stop them from being manifested on the earth even and now can you imagine if all hell is aimed now because that is not a natural thing for a human to kill somebody that is demon powers possessing them you watch these women's rights group there is an abundance of women on the streets where's the men this is a woman's rights thing now if all hell is aimed at preventing life of the natural body how much more is the attack on the spiritual body to prevent the new birth yes so what are we talking about aborting the seed of discrepancy and reproducing the seed of god amen so at one time they did receive some seed they received justification sanctification amen they were receiving it amen and they were pregnant and they were going to come forth in a new birth because the new birth requires three stages and they were coming amen coming up and up the pentecostals received just the initial evidence they had some emotion they were in labor pain but then there was an abortion they killed it they stifled it they settled for tradition of man amen hallelujah yes amen they did not go on to receive the new birth and the baptism of the holy ghost why they rejected the gynecologist william branham amen yes amen they rejected him and now if they in the u.s are saying now remember what is it going back to back to the political lines the red states will have abortion or anti-abortion laws the blue states will have pro-abortion laws everything is going back to politics amen so in those certain states those red states you'll find it's illegal to abort we want satan to know there will be no spiritual abortions you cannot abort the word of god that's been shown in our hearts amen amen hallelujah we know the holy spirit gives life to the word it quickens the word that was sown within us we are going all the way to the new birth the baptism of the holy ghost isn't that what we've been speaking about in the adoption series our new land the holy ghost to quicken means to bring to life that's what the holy spirit has come to do to bring to life god's own life zoe life the genuine holy spirit only brings to life his own amen let that settle in your heart the holy spirit will not bring to life something that's not of his yes so if you got a wrong spirit stone within you it will not bring that to life if you want the holy spirit to bring the word of god to life in you you must die to the everything that's not of god amen amen you cannot have twins growing in this room this is not the room of heave in the garden of eden you cannot have cain growing with abel in this bride amen amen one must die amen it won't bring a creed to life the holy spirit won't bring a creed to life the holy spirit won't bring traditions and man's ideas to life but it will bring the word of god to life amen it'll quicken the body of christ in the moment in the twinkling of an eye let's go in the invisible union of the bride of christ paragraph 49 it says but watch now he's talking about us let's focus on us a bit when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of god watch then you see how the scriptures at that time there will be a message sweep to catch their bride catch that woman elect but then watch again to the spiritual church how that groups of people called out the elected through every revival he says in martin luther it happened the same way in the reformation it happened the same in the time of john wesley it happened the same thing when pentecostal first started they dropped them woman right back in line with the word and then they drift away let it not be the case with us there she goes right back over into chaos but then the time that the people are ready to line up there is a message comes forth and they line with it amen amen but remember satan is a deceiver he'll come in with deception you'll say but i i don't believe in abortion i haven't aborted the seed but he's aborted your prayer life he's aborted your bible reading time he's aborted you don't even listen to the tapes anymore aborted it you'll get what you want you want to just come on a sunday and listen to us a fancy sermon you'll get it he comes in with fertility he comes in with deception slowly chipping away taking inch by inch [Music] what's it brother ram is your favorite saying what's he doing it it's like a frog in the water heating it up slowly amen luther was the messenger of one day of justification the church lined right with death wesley comes sanctification the church lined with it pentecost came restoration of the gifts the church lined with it the elect of that day then faded away went right back off into denominationalism went right out to the rest of them but you notice when people try to align with the word of god there comes a fresh message from the word of god right straight to the people and they catch that message and line up every time he says we have that amen we've got a fresh message we want the seed of jesus christ and the spirit of christ amen the prophet cried out against that amen you wanted us to fall in love with jesus to have a relationship with jesus people as brother branham says sometimes people take on the spirit of the pastor and they think they got the holy spirit hallelujah the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age are you the people of this age are you manifesting the promised word of today then he says you are the seed of today they are the children of the kingdom amen aren't you glad that we are the children of the kingdom amen we are the children of the kingdom amen for the children of the king have a right to shout and sing the manifestation of the holy spirit operating through his children in those seed of the kingdom of that age amen all of god's program all of his culmination of his redemption plan is resting on you and i stay the am stay in line amen hallelujah we must press for perfection we must press on amen to reach the mark of the eye calling amen blessed be the name of jesus amen amen hallelujah oh hallelujah i pray tonight you are not just settling back and thinking hey it's another wednesday night but be on fire for god amen hallelujah if god is admonishing us tonight here is warning because he said amen it will be a minority group that will be taken away not somebody who's playing church amen we are losing gems we are losing precious souls that came in under the first wave of the message to sweep durban let us hold precious message amen let us hold dear the message that was passed on to us yes let us be true to it [Music] let us hold ourselves accountable to the word of god amen we all if we are working we want to be accountable to some boss to some earthly boss how about our heavenly boss can we be held accountable to him [Music] now he wants to talk to us a bit and watch how reverend he is when he's talking about this bride he says may i add to this woman grace you say brother but there's nothing good in me grace amen i don't deserve it it's his grace none of us deserve it but it is grace it's his choosing grace is what god's unmerited favor he says may i place her in the bible as called the elect lady hallelujah amen you may have been carrying out dish water in the back of the party but just one conversation with him made you the elect lady amen he says i'm going to talk about you you know the bible declares to the elect lady there if you notice elect come from the word elected lady one lady among all other ladies was elected amen some of you women know what that's feeling is like you walk around so proud with your husband amen and that's how the bride should be the bride of the lord jesus christ so many women flirting with him calling his name saying we have his name but you are the elected lady amen we chose you be proud of jesus christ amen he says if you notice elect comes from the word elected lady one lady amongst all the other ladies was elected like the virgin was to bring forth the bride bring forth the body of god on the earth she was an elected woman god chose mary god had chosen an elected lady which is his bride she is elected i hope we're members of that tonight across the world how many of you from south africa can say yes brother branham from across the world across the nation the illustration here showing the relationship of bride to christ the elect lady how she was brought to him where she would come from he knew everything about you amen one time you quoted that ugly denominational guy you remember you caught to that ugly some of you thinking i'm talking about literally i'm talking about the spiritual church you're trying to remember which ugly denominational guy you were watching i'm talking about the church and they took you in their church and they started to feed you and you couldn't settle because every week they were saying this is your season this is your time sowing to the ministry partner with us and you couldn't stomach that and they say do you have declarations in your church we like declarations i declare i am the head and not the tale i am blessed coming in i am blessed going out they're taking all our blessings and they're saying i want to declare it amen you'll find that they'll put their psalm 91 protected by psalm 23 they love declarations all of their declarations are about financial blessings amen then they'll tell you turn to your brother and prophesy amen where we are amen he says here she was she would be brought to him the church and illustration that we got in view is illustrated by women which a woman is always the type of the church because the church is considered a bride a bride she is the bride of the lord jesus the son of god always if you watch watch the conditions the conduct of women and you'll see where the church is but the branham in another message says the beauty of the church is the character of the people amen so we always ought to display a godly christ-like character amen we should never let down our lord jesus christ by letting that old man flare up [Music] because their own nature has got to die if you are finding their own nature rising up then you have only divorced him he says it's not the outside situation smelling here it isn't it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you down in here inside that is the person that cannot die and that's the person that the new life starts from from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this talking about your theory of your body coming amen from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around their life you get it so potentially it's in here but what is and what is it the word promised before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative that will reflect a positive this life is nothing but a negative reflection of a positive you amen hallelujah yes amen if you think amen so highly of yourself here and you think that there is none like you you ain't seen nothing yet there's a better one there's a better body an improved body amen in fact it's out of this world amen do we read that so potentially it's in here what is it he's talking about this new life now he says the word promised from before the foundation of the world and around there it only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive he says the translation of the bride will be the same thing watch we are nearing the translation now right so while we're talking about this we are preparing for translation these messages are designed to give us faith for translation right the word that's in you the seed that's in you the one that you didn't abort [Music] the body new body will materialize around that word right he says the same thing did by sarah the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word that's in you so the word may be making you look old-fashioned the world may the word that's in you may be looking yeah people are scorning and laughing and mocking you maybe you're not even happy with your appearance but he says that seed that's in you that word that's in you that new body will materialize around that word you know which one i'm talking about the one that david spoke about by what have i hid in my heart amen he says when that old body that she had that first body it had to be changed in order to produce a sun you get it your body could not do it this body cannot do it so it has to be changed the same way to receive the sun he says not even sin is imputed to a genuine believer i don't know if you want to be a genuine believer he says not even sin is imputed to you did you know that he that's born of god does not commit sin he cannot sin see it's not even imputed why david says blessed is the man who god will not impute sin when you're in christ are we in christ you have no desire to sin the worshiper once purged as normal conscience of sin you don't desire it now to the world you might be a sinner but to god you're not because you're in christ how can you be a sinner when you're in the sinless one and god only sees him who you are in when he looks at you there's blood between him and you and he sees you as a sinless spotless bride he's given you the royal robes of his word to clothe yourselves amen to clothe ourselves in this evening time when it's darkness and chaos all around us when the scramming in the land he's given us food to eat who has given us clothing he's giving us food amen hallelujah what a blessed heavenly father now that one sower sold his seed in the field and he left it for somebody else to take care of god is not like that sower god cares for his own he turns for his own field he tends for his own crop he sees it all the way to others time amen he nurtures it he protects it now i'm asking you as a as the woman as the wife of jesus christ the seed that's within you protect it nurture it water it with prayer water it with reading the word nurture it give it sunlight open the bible and sunlight will strike you amen give it some vitamin d give it all the nutrients you need if we in the natural can be so particular about when we are raising a natural baby inside of us we need to get all the right nutrients and a mother will sacrifice a lot not eat certain foods because she wants the baby to get the right nutrients how much more the spiritual bride of jesus christ must sacrifice the things of the world the pleasures of the world so that the seed within you can get the right nutrients the right sunlight the right word amen hallelujah can we give the lord a good anchor for praise amen so we know what seeds of discrepancies are they are creeds dogmas man-made ideas if those things have been growing with us we need to abort them terminate their life [Music] and say holy spirit this evening i want you to sow your word in me amen amen what's the use we've come so far in the message so long in the message and then we fall off at the end because when he comes back he is looking for his very own life the token life must be on display amen so i pray even as this wednesday night prayer meeting that we can examine our hearts this evening church is not coming to listen to some good message but it should take it's the house of correction it's to check up on our body he says the sickest body is the church we ought to come into the house of the lord and look into the looking glass of god's word and say lord if this is me and these are the areas i need to work on in my life then let us pay attention to it let us give attention to the word of god let's focus on god now everyone has closed every above amen blessed be the name of the lord he is truly worthy to be praised amen now when our husband our lord jesus christ comes to us let's not reject him like vastly but let's be like esther a woman was chosen for the king [Music] amen vastly had her own woman's rights she had her own movement going on in her own party hallelujah but how are we making preparation for the king [Music] are we there at every call at every command can we open up our hearts to him this evening let us stand now as [Music] as we sing to the lord and worship him amen blessed be the name of the lord he's worthy to be praised he's worthy to be a daughter amen [Music] jesus is worthy hallelujah [Music] let your word be born in the manger of my heart and let it live in me let it shine and live inside this house of clay and mold it every day and let your word be born in the manger of my heart let's sing it again let your word let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me and let it live inside this house live inside this house of molded molded everyday my
