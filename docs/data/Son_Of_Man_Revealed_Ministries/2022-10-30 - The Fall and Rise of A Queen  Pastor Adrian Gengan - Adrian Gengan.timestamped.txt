[3:16] who was that is to come amen hallelujah
[3:19] amen I trust
[3:21] that everyone is well even as we draw
[3:23] one day closer to the coming of the Lord
[3:25] when we shall be changed from these
[3:27] vital creatures that we are into a
[3:30] glorified being that we are amen right
[3:33] now represented in the sixth Dimension
[3:35] is theophany bodies that are waiting for
[3:38] your release
[3:39] amen and I tell you the Bible says that
[3:42] all creation is groaning
[3:44] and they are a part of creation
[3:47] amen for 6 000 years man has gone into
[3:51] this dimension
[3:54] longing to come back to the earth into
[3:56] the ought to be conditioned
[3:58] and here we are the Bible says that all
[4:00] creation is groaning waiting for the
[4:02] manifestation of the sons and the
[4:04] daughters of God and we are living at
[4:06] the brink of that hour
[4:09] amen hallelujah so we greet you all in
[4:11] the precious name of Jesus Amen I trust
[4:14] that you are well amen hallelujah let's
[4:16] turn to the Bible Esther chapter 2 verse
[4:18] 16.
[4:20] who speak this morning amen the Fallen
[4:22] rise of a queen
[4:23] amen
[4:26] we're just taking nuggets you know this
[4:28] week after week we're just taking
[4:29] nuggets out of Esther
[4:30] amen
[4:34] Esther 2 verse 16 so Esther was taken
[4:37] unto King asaurus into his house in the
[4:41] tenth month which is the month of in the
[4:44] seventh year of his Reign so there's 10
[4:46] 7 amen under the message of 10 7 we go
[4:50] into the Kings Royal House in verse 17
[4:54] and the King loved Esther above all
[4:56] women above all churches now and she
[4:59] obtained grace and favor in his sight
[5:01] more than all the other virgins more
[5:04] than the other five who didn't have oil
[5:07] so that he set the Royal Crown upon her
[5:10] head and made a Queen instead of vasty
[5:13] [Music]
[5:14] right what happens after we become Queen
[5:17] don't we go to a married supper then see
[5:19] Verse 18 then the king made a great
[5:21] feast
[5:23] so that's likened unto the married
[5:24] supper and to all his princes and his
[5:27] servants even Esther's feast and he made
[5:30] a release to the provinces and gave
[5:32] gifts according to the state of the king
[5:34] amen so right there we notice one thing
[5:37] one Queen had fallen fasting
[5:40] and yet another king is risen Our Queen
[5:42] is risen Esther let's turn to Revelation
[5:45] 5 and 5 this is just to tie in how it's
[5:48] possible that we
[5:51] can rise up after a fall
[5:54] we find ourselves in a human condition
[5:57] subject to
[5:59] the five senses and it's really the five
[6:02] senses that are warring against the
[6:04] spirit man
[6:06] so
[6:07] then the prophet says we're backslide
[6:09] daily
[6:10] amen but here's a way that we can rise
[6:13] every day
[6:15] because of what happened here
[6:17] so there's a cry going out I'm not going
[6:19] to read it from all I'm just going from
[6:20] verse 5. who's worthy to take the book
[6:22] of redemption there was nobody found
[6:24] worthy they searched Heaven they
[6:26] searched fear they even searched beneath
[6:27] the Earth meaning they searched the
[6:29] realm of the Dead to see if there was a
[6:32] man who had gone by was worthy so they
[6:35] looked at Adam Abraham Isaac Jacob and
[6:37] all of these Great Men of God and no one
[6:39] was found worthy
[6:41] so yeah we'll pick it up in verse 5 when
[6:43] one of the Islanders said unto me weep
[6:46] not behold the line of the tribe of
[6:49] Judah the root of David
[6:52] had prevailed to open the book
[6:56] notice it's in a past tense
[6:59] not is going to prevail
[7:02] but had prevailed Amen to open the book
[7:05] amen
[7:07] amen
[7:08] to open the book means to lose the Seven
[7:11] Seals thereof and I beheld and low in
[7:15] the midst of the throne and of the four
[7:17] peace and in the midst of the elders
[7:19] stood a lamb yes as it had been slain
[7:23] having seven arms and seven eyes
[7:27] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[7:29] forth into all the Earth
[7:32] and he came and took the book out of the
[7:34] right hand of him that sat upon the
[7:36] throne
[7:37] and when he had taken the book The Four
[7:40] beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders
[7:43] fell down before the lamb having every
[7:45] one of them ups and golden Wilds full of
[7:48] odors which are the praise of the Saints
[7:51] and they sang a new song Thou Art Worthy
[7:55] to take the book and to open the Seal's
[7:57] day off for thou was slain and has
[8:00] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[8:03] every Kindred tongue people Nations
[8:07] and he had made us unto our God Kings
[8:10] and Priests and we shall reign in heaven
[8:14] we shall reign on the earth man's
[8:18] rightful position
[8:19] so because of that he puts us back into
[8:22] our rightful position because of the
[8:23] scene amen you may be seated the Lord
[8:25] and blessings to the reading of his word
[8:29] amen
[8:31] Hallelujah
[8:38] amen we look around the world today and
[8:41] we see that Society
[8:44] if we're going to say is collapsing but
[8:46] we can also say as totally collapsed
[8:49] if we look at the moral situation
[8:52] the economic situation
[8:54] the social situation the political
[8:56] situation they are on a downward spiral
[8:59] until they are going to end up in the
[9:02] bottomless pit in the Lake of Fire
[9:06] we notice the one that is responsible
[9:08] for putting them in this condition
[9:11] is Satan
[9:13] yeah when Satan was in heaven he tried
[9:16] to destabilize the kingdom of heaven
[9:20] and now that he was on the Earth
[9:23] we're talking about Genesis now
[9:25] he was trying to destabilize the Earth
[9:29] his attempts to destabilize in heaven
[9:33] got squashed
[9:36] amen and he got kicked out of heaven
[9:38] amen
[9:40] now that he's on the earth he's no
[9:42] longer the Royal Sheriff that surrounds
[9:45] the throne
[9:47] he's not the most beautiful angel but he
[9:50] is cast down to the Earth
[9:52] and is a spirit that can influence
[9:55] bodies
[9:56] and he found a serpent
[9:59] then he began to possess
[10:02] and he began to speak through the
[10:04] serpent
[10:06] amen and through the serpent he was
[10:09] trying to destabilize the Earth
[10:12] in heaven amen we said his plan was met
[10:15] with Fierce resistance and he could not
[10:17] Prevail over Michael and his angels
[10:21] now when it comes down to the Earth
[10:24] he does not have the kind of power and
[10:27] authority like man has
[10:29] because man was pleased ruler over the
[10:32] Earth
[10:34] man was God of the Earth
[10:37] God had made man ruler over the earth
[10:40] and the prophet will say this you'll
[10:43] find this in fundamental foundations of
[10:45] our faith I think it's sin
[10:48] maybe paragraph eight you'll begin to
[10:50] pick this up in fundamental foundations
[10:52] for Faith amen
[10:55] I didn't get my stick back so I would
[10:57] have given you the notes but it's fine
[10:59] just find it in fundamental foundations
[11:00] of Faith amen
[11:03] the prophet would say like this that he
[11:05] made Man Superior to anything on Earth
[11:10] he gave him the jurisdiction of
[11:12] everything on Earth to control
[11:14] everything
[11:15] men could control animal life
[11:18] he controlled the bird life the fish of
[11:21] the sea he controlled botany life he
[11:24] could speak to Wildlife and it would
[11:26] obey him he could speak to the waters
[11:30] amen yes
[11:32] yes Adam could speak to the wind and it
[11:34] could stop
[11:35] Adam could speak and say peace be still
[11:39] and the winds and the waves would have
[11:41] been here
[11:43] amen I want you to know that this is how
[11:46] man is supposed to be yes
[11:49] you and I are supposed to be in this
[11:50] position
[11:52] there's nobody else on the face of the
[11:55] Earth that'll be able to tell you where
[11:57] man fell from
[11:59] not even the denominations no the kind
[12:02] of authority that Adam had
[12:04] it's only the prophet that is unveiling
[12:07] that Adam Had Creative power
[12:10] and could speak these things into
[12:12] existence
[12:14] outside of the message nobody knows that
[12:18] children are supposed to come by the
[12:20] spoken word
[12:23] Hallelujah you're not going to learn in
[12:27] school you are only going to learn about
[12:29] a five cents man amen a flesh-body man
[12:32] the anatomy of a man the biology of a
[12:35] man that can dissect the man
[12:38] but you will never hear that man as his
[12:41] spirit amen
[12:42] amen
[12:44] they're gonna tell us that man has his
[12:46] soul
[12:48] but in the kingdom of God he tells us
[12:51] that we are a spirit being that was put
[12:54] into a body of Flesh and we possess a
[12:57] soul
[12:59] amen
[13:01] and the Soul like the prophet says is
[13:03] the nature of the spirit
[13:06] I ask you to examine the nature of your
[13:08] soul this morning
[13:10] because in the soul can either be Faith
[13:12] or doubt what is the nature and the
[13:15] condition of your soul
[13:16] is it full of Faith this morning or is
[13:19] it full of doubt and reasoning
[13:22] because that's what happened to cause
[13:24] the queen of Eden to fall
[13:30] he was a woman of faith
[13:32] she was living in a faith civilization
[13:34] she was watching Adam operating his
[13:38] gifting and his anointing
[13:40] yeah
[13:42] amen
[13:44] so we know that Adam and Eve never had
[13:46] to be sick they never had worries they
[13:49] never had gray hair they never had
[13:52] heartache never had fear never had to
[13:55] worry about death
[13:57] amen and the prophet would say every
[13:59] evening they would just climb into the
[14:01] arms of the father just like a child
[14:03] everything was his and whatever he asked
[14:06] for he got it
[14:10] everything obeyed him because he was a
[14:12] child of God and the prophet says the
[14:14] child is heir of all things
[14:19] now in paragraph verse paragraph nine
[14:21] you'll pick this up in the same message
[14:23] fundamental foundations for Faith he
[14:26] says man was a secondary God on Earth
[14:29] he was given power to control all things
[14:36] all elements of the Earth
[14:38] that was Adam Adam was given these great
[14:41] powers
[14:45] did we have another Adam in our day
[14:49] who could speak to the fish of the sea
[14:52] I give you back your life
[14:55] he could speak to the Flying piece
[14:59] and say do not harm me amen
[15:04] could he speak to the peace in the field
[15:06] yes the Raging Bull
[15:09] Adam reproduce again on the earth
[15:11] because of redemption's claims amen
[15:19] if the prophet was not taken of the
[15:21] Earth
[15:22] this man was like Enoch
[15:28] you don't believe me
[15:30] could read the time he was walking
[15:31] through that storm
[15:33] yes
[15:35] amen you remember the time he thought
[15:38] and he spoke to the storm and he cleared
[15:40] and then as it cleared he said he walked
[15:42] a little way and he went into Virgin
[15:43] Territory of wood Timber
[15:45] and he says in the next he was thinking
[15:47] about his wife Mira that he had married
[15:49] on October
[15:51] maybe 24th I think it was amen and he
[15:54] said he went there every year and he
[15:56] would just as a commemoration he would
[15:59] think about his wife
[16:00] and he said as he began to sit there he
[16:03] looked before he says tears was running
[16:05] down his eyes he was thinking about all
[16:07] of these things
[16:08] and he was looking at the steers falling
[16:11] on his gray whiskers
[16:13] and then in a moment in the twinkling of
[16:15] an eye
[16:16] he says he looked in front of him
[16:19] and he saw his young body this young man
[16:23] yes
[16:26] what caused him to change dimensions
[16:29] what caused him to change the atoms of
[16:31] his body if not an Enoch walk
[16:35] and he said appearing in front of him
[16:37] was who
[16:40] now you go and fathom that out
[16:44] shall we leave
[16:47] shall we change dimensions
[16:50] there is a realm that we can tap into
[16:52] and that's be where we are heading to
[16:54] right now amen but we've got to create
[16:57] that Faith civilization again yes amen
[17:01] amen
[17:03] he told us how to live in a world of
[17:05] perfect Faith which only us and God
[17:07] Alone
[17:09] he gave us the key ingredients too
[17:12] getting perfect Faith
[17:14] now we need to use it right in order to
[17:17] achieve this
[17:19] in the second coming of Christ okay
[17:21] sorry we got verse 9 there let's just
[17:23] stay there
[17:23] let's see where he failed right so he
[17:26] was a second regard on Earth he was
[17:28] given power to control all things all
[17:30] elements of fear that was Adam
[17:33] Adam was given these great powers
[17:36] then Adam then the power that he was
[17:39] given to reproduce himself is where he
[17:42] fell
[17:44] what is that
[17:46] the power to reproduce himself is where
[17:50] he fell
[17:54] now
[17:55] how did he fall he was not supposed to
[17:58] come via natural child bearing
[18:01] why sowing the seed into Eve he was
[18:05] supposed to buy the spoken word speak
[18:08] you know this book that we read about in
[18:10] Revelation 5 where the names were in
[18:12] he's supposed to speak every name in
[18:14] that book
[18:15] amen amen
[18:17] amen
[18:19] now what Adam failed to do Jesus Christ
[18:23] the last Adam the Redeemer is
[18:25] successfully reproducing his life
[18:32] amen
[18:33] why the spoken word because the spoken
[18:36] word is the original scene amen now the
[18:40] prophet would go on the same we read the
[18:41] sport last week in the second coming of
[18:43] Christ the church is married to Christ
[18:45] we are the wife of Christ bringing four
[18:47] children so what he failed to do we are
[18:50] doing bringing forth his very own life
[18:53] we are becoming Sons and Daughters of
[18:55] God until we reach full adoption amen we
[18:59] shall receive full adoption when we
[19:01] receive our body change
[19:07] we shall be in our ought to be
[19:09] conditioned in that body in a glorified
[19:11] body in the message the Rapture
[19:13] paragraph 99 he says Jesus wants fruit
[19:16] for himself his wife must bring forth
[19:20] the kind of children that he is
[19:25] now what kind of person is Jesus
[19:28] Jesus is God
[19:31] Jesus is the King of Kings and the Lord
[19:33] of lords
[19:35] amen Jesus he's holy Jesus is righteous
[19:38] Jesus is perfect amen and that's the
[19:42] kind of children that's the kind of life
[19:44] that we must bring forth
[19:47] perfection
[19:49] amen hallelujah
[19:52] in the message fundamental foundations
[19:54] of Faith again paragraph 26 he says God
[19:57] is depending on you as a member of his
[19:59] body to bear fruit of his spirit
[20:04] now if he's depending on you let's open
[20:07] up our channels
[20:09] and let the Holy Spirit come in and
[20:11] energize us and free us from all these
[20:14] fears and doubts amen he says revivals
[20:17] come
[20:20] okay
[20:24] have we got have we got back to the
[20:26] fundamental foundations of faith I want
[20:28] to get to this Fortune
[20:30] important
[20:32] so Fallen man lost certain things
[20:36] lost certain privileges
[20:39] he says now
[20:42] that is the beginning of man that's what
[20:44] God give him power over everything on
[20:47] Earth you may pick it up maybe from
[20:50] paragraph 11 if you can just check them
[20:54] he says that is the beginning of man
[20:56] that's what God gave him power over
[20:59] everything on Earth
[21:01] Earth fall
[21:02] but we're always telling you that Adam
[21:04] lost three things he lost power over the
[21:06] Earth he lost fellowship with God and he
[21:09] lost eternal life you'll pick this up in
[21:11] this culture he says through the fall he
[21:14] lost that power
[21:17] then it becomes unconscious of the fact
[21:21] that's what I try to tell you that
[21:24] normal man does not know that man
[21:26] supposed to possess the power
[21:30] and the authority
[21:33] he says it becomes unconscious of the
[21:36] fact
[21:38] so he lost fellowship with God now watch
[21:40] he says so through the fall he lost that
[21:42] power
[21:43] then it becomes unconscious to the fact
[21:45] and he says after losing his
[21:48] relationship and friendship fellowship
[21:51] with the father he lost that so he loses
[21:54] fellowship with God
[21:56] right and he says all of these great
[21:59] channels become clogged up and he
[22:01] couldn't get through now when man
[22:03] finally lost this
[22:05] what he lost in the fall Christ come as
[22:07] a redeemer did he ever stop to think
[22:09] what Christ redeemed us for he has
[22:12] eternal life now he gave us everlasting
[22:15] life
[22:16] he brought us back to Eternal fellowship
[22:18] and relationship to God to be his sons
[22:22] and daughters again to restore back all
[22:24] that Adam lost in the fall
[22:27] so it Adam lost power over the Earth
[22:30] eternal life and fellowship of God when
[22:33] Jesus Christ he's taken the book in
[22:35] Revelation 5 and he's coming down with
[22:37] that same book in Revelation 10.
[22:40] then man must be restored back to
[22:42] fellowship with God
[22:44] men must be restored the power over the
[22:47] Earth and man must be restored back to
[22:50] eternal life
[22:53] yeah
[22:57] paragraph 11.
[23:00] see what he says the condition of a man
[23:02] who has his Avenues clogged up he says
[23:05] the thing of it is since he has restored
[23:07] man back to this place
[23:10] man lost his conscience of what the
[23:12] father put him on Earth to do in other
[23:14] words all of the plumbing as it was in
[23:17] our brain and the outlets the faith has
[23:20] been clogged up with business affair
[23:25] with home life
[23:28] domestic things
[23:31] now you're the spiritual being
[23:34] with such power and authority that we
[23:36] are trying to describe to you this
[23:37] morning
[23:38] but watch what's coming to Cloud the
[23:41] channels of this faith
[23:44] business affairs
[23:46] home life
[23:48] domestic things
[23:50] it's become so clogged up with that till
[23:53] God can't operate through those channels
[23:56] that he made for man
[24:00] now who is behind this
[24:03] the one that had come to destabilize the
[24:05] Earth
[24:06] the man wants to strip us of our ought
[24:09] to be conditioned
[24:13] amen but I want you to know no matter
[24:16] how sinful man is no matter what state
[24:18] man finds himself in if he's a son and
[24:22] daughter of a God Amen even in his
[24:24] Fallen condition he is still a son of
[24:27] God
[24:28] amen amen and at a certain time and
[24:31] season God is going to blast through
[24:34] every one of those club channels amen so
[24:37] that the Holy Ghost can flow freely
[24:39] through him and he comes back to his
[24:42] right senses amen
[24:46] why because the price had been paid for
[24:50] his full Redemption
[24:52] God's not going to pay the price for our
[24:54] full Redemption and then leave us in a
[24:56] fallen condition he's going to come to
[24:58] empower us
[25:00] thank you
[25:03] amen hallelujah
[25:05] paragraph 12
[25:07] I'm going to paraphrase some of this so
[25:09] God designed every the body of our
[25:12] bodies right he designed every organ he
[25:16] designed every part of the human body to
[25:18] function perfectly in order for men to
[25:21] live
[25:24] in order for you to live your heart has
[25:26] got to function properly your lung your
[25:28] liver your kidney
[25:31] if one of these things stop functioning
[25:34] you have a struggle to live
[25:36] yes
[25:38] and he goes on to eventually say this if
[25:42] God so designed the body of a man how
[25:45] much more has he designed and sit in
[25:47] order the body of Christ the church
[25:50] that if one of these organs or members
[25:54] of the body do not function properly
[25:57] the whole body suffers
[26:01] so how did he design the spiritual body
[26:04] he said he designed us to come together
[26:07] in Heavenly places in Christ and have
[26:10] these Supernatural walkings of God
[26:14] through gifts of the Spirit such as
[26:16] prophecy wisdom knowledge gift of
[26:19] healing
[26:20] and all these other different gifts is
[26:24] Outlets that God lets out his power and
[26:27] let out his Revelation to his people
[26:30] how is God going to work if you're
[26:32] following the prophet he's walking
[26:34] through the body to bring Revelation to
[26:36] the people
[26:40] and he says and not as an individual
[26:46] amen
[26:48] amen we do not do it as an individual
[26:52] he says but we as a unit we all together
[26:55] one great body of believers
[27:00] now if Satan by what he tried to do to
[27:03] destabilize the health he's so doubt and
[27:04] reasoning into Eve right
[27:07] if Satan could achieve
[27:10] so much without any reasoning
[27:15] with the law of sin and death
[27:19] that through Satan's command he can send
[27:21] forth cancer into a body
[27:24] and the prophet says man recognizes it
[27:26] and receives it
[27:30] follow what he's saying he says Satan
[27:32] sins artists we recognize it and we
[27:35] receive it
[27:37] a paragraph 13 now I think we are he
[27:40] says if Satan by his power can make his
[27:42] laws work in man
[27:44] how much more God to make his power
[27:47] with his power make his laws work in man
[27:51] amen yes
[27:54] how much more God to his children make
[27:56] his laws be recognized amongst his
[27:59] people of Divine Healing revelation
[28:02] power gifts manifestation of the spirits
[28:05] amen amen the law of sin and death works
[28:08] in the people and the law of Liberty of
[28:11] Christ has come to set us free from
[28:13] those things
[28:14] amen so we are nearing this time now
[28:17] where we are going to recognize these
[28:19] things he says there's been vain
[28:21] philosophies so for teachings to take
[28:24] the human mind and make it rebel against
[28:26] from the word of God
[28:30] now what are we talking about faith
[28:33] coming back to the church
[28:35] that's how this queen is going to rise
[28:37] up
[28:38] by faith
[28:40] and he says faith doesn't come by
[28:42] fasting
[28:44] Faith doesn't come back pain
[28:46] Faith doesn't come by reading a book all
[28:49] of that's good fasting praying reading a
[28:52] book but faith comes by settle something
[28:54] that's in the human heart
[28:56] what is that the word of God
[28:59] because Faith come about the hearing of
[29:01] the word
[29:02] [Music]
[29:05] paragraph 14
[29:08] he says if we could throw ourselves
[29:09] completely to God and His will and be
[29:12] lost to our own thoughts
[29:15] and just let the mind of Christ be in US
[29:18] them same operations of the spirit would
[29:21] work through us just as the Natural
[29:23] Things does just the same
[29:25] [Music]
[29:30] but how hard it is for the man to submit
[29:32] the flesh man
[29:38] he says we were created for purpose to
[29:40] control to rule and to praise God and
[29:43] live for God
[29:45] [Music]
[29:46] everything that is that God spoke in his
[29:50] word if received in the right Channel
[29:52] will meet you realize that word for
[29:55] whatever the promise behind it is God
[29:57] will do it he's obligated to do it
[30:00] amen he said if you abide in me and my
[30:02] words abide in you
[30:04] then you can have what you asked for
[30:06] right
[30:07] whatever you ask in my name that will I
[30:10] do
[30:10] he says paragraph 16 amen do you realize
[30:14] that if we go before God in Jesus name
[30:17] it's just the same as Jesus himself
[30:19] praying
[30:25] it isn't me praying anymore
[30:28] okay
[30:29] if I come in his name and he recognizes
[30:32] his name Jesus said whatever you ask the
[30:35] father in my name that I do and then I
[30:38] go to the father in Jesus name it isn't
[30:41] me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his
[30:43] Spirit praying through me and then I've
[30:46] got to receive what I asked for because
[30:48] he said and it's God's Own word amen
[30:53] amen
[30:55] so we look at Eve
[30:57] and we see that the fall took us away
[31:00] from perfect faith
[31:02] but Redemption brought us back to it
[31:06] now Faith is an unseen Force known only
[31:09] to the believer
[31:12] I don't know if you can say Amen
[31:14] I don't know if you told the doctors
[31:17] something by faith
[31:20] the doctor told you had this and you
[31:22] told them no I do not have that
[31:26] he is operating by his five senses
[31:29] and he's telling you by all that I
[31:32] studied
[31:33] and all the medical experience we've had
[31:36] over the last 6 000 years
[31:38] we have come to the conclusion of the
[31:41] matter
[31:42] that you will die
[31:46] because of this illness and you tell
[31:49] them through six thousand years
[31:51] my Heritage and my forefathers have
[31:55] passed down Faith to my civilization
[31:58] and through all my experiences
[32:02] I am telling you I shall not die but I
[32:05] shall live Amen to see the glory of God
[32:08] Amen and you can't understand what you
[32:10] are talking about
[32:13] you're telling doctor
[32:15] I do not believe your report
[32:18] amen and he asked you whose report will
[32:20] you believe
[32:23] and you shall tell him we shall believe
[32:26] the report of the Lord
[32:30] because his report says I am free
[32:33] his report is I am healed
[32:37] his report says victory
[32:41] amen we believe the report of the king
[32:44] that by his stripes we are healed
[32:49] amen amen
[32:50] so faith is the Unseen Force
[32:54] and Satan walking in the serpent in the
[32:57] Garden of Eden
[32:59] he can't see it
[33:01] but he can feel the sweet atmosphere
[33:05] and he said you know what
[33:07] something's got to be done to change the
[33:10] atmosphere in this place
[33:12] because he cannot live in an atmosphere
[33:15] of faith
[33:17] Satan is paralyzed in an atmosphere of
[33:20] faith
[33:23] and I want to believe that that this
[33:25] place this morning and atmosphere of
[33:28] Faith where Satan is paralyzed and all
[33:31] sickness and demons were free yes Lord
[33:35] amen amen
[33:39] I want you to know that right now
[33:40] there's an unseen Force going through
[33:42] this building
[33:46] it's operating
[33:49] it's at six cents
[33:51] but right now there's also other things
[33:55] flowing through this room other channels
[33:57] flowing through this room
[33:59] I'm gonna describe it for you now we
[34:01] live in a modern age of Technology where
[34:04] I'm going to bring it up to date the
[34:05] prophet will talk about telegrams I'm
[34:07] going to talk about maybe a WhatsApp or
[34:10] your phone that you can send a picture
[34:12] or a text or a video
[34:15] instantly
[34:17] even to the father most part of the
[34:19] Earth
[34:20] now I want to let the younger people
[34:21] know that this was not always possible
[34:27] if you wanted to contact somebody in
[34:29] another country
[34:31] a few years ago you had to write them a
[34:33] letter
[34:38] right this is history lesson for you
[34:40] guys now
[34:42] you have to write them a letter you have
[34:44] to go to the Post Office and buy a stamp
[34:47] you have to put that stamp on that
[34:49] letter and you had to post it off
[34:52] it used to get shipped
[34:55] or if you wanted to send it via airmail
[34:57] you could send it
[34:58] and it could take them maybe a couple of
[35:01] weeks or a month
[35:03] then they must read your letter
[35:07] and they didn't Blue Tick you
[35:12] all right
[35:14] right they add the courtesy
[35:18] they would respond now they must write
[35:21] back to you
[35:22] they must go back to the post office
[35:25] they must put that stamp on that
[35:28] and post it back
[35:30] come on another ship
[35:32] back to you
[35:34] so if you had a few questions you better
[35:36] ask in one letter
[35:38] otherwise it's going to be a back and
[35:40] forth
[35:41] but I'm showing you how science has
[35:43] evolved
[35:45] [Music]
[35:46] so rapidly over this last few years
[35:51] you know young people not even the young
[35:53] people most of you sitting here you
[35:55] didn't have cell phones 20 years ago
[35:58] maybe 25 years ago 30 years ago
[36:02] you didn't have this device in your
[36:04] pocket
[36:05] how are these signals being sent
[36:08] how is that picture if I send it right
[36:10] now you can receive it instantly
[36:12] it's called ether waves
[36:15] can you see it
[36:18] but yet you see that beautiful picture
[36:22] you see that video in full color
[36:25] how did it travel from here to there
[36:29] how is that text being transmitted
[36:32] to that screen
[36:36] if we were connected via Bluetooth
[36:38] Bluetooth would be an unseen Force
[36:42] but you'll be project projecting that
[36:44] image
[36:46] I'm trying to make it so that you
[36:48] understand how faith is a sense that's
[36:51] not seen
[36:52] but yet can be so tangible can be
[36:55] experienced amen
[36:57] amen amen so it moves through into waves
[37:00] yet no man can see that picture moving
[37:02] that video moving
[37:04] but you know this Machinery that can see
[37:06] it
[37:08] because if you commit a crime they can
[37:11] take your cell phone
[37:13] and they can see where that thing
[37:14] originated from the document the video
[37:17] and all the channels it went through
[37:20] right
[37:22] why the prophet says because it's too
[37:25] fast for the human eye
[37:27] but there's a force
[37:30] and he says he says there's still a
[37:32] force even though it's unseen to the
[37:34] human eye right
[37:36] and the continent is delivered to your
[37:38] phone like I try to explain now in
[37:40] paragraph 19 let's go there
[37:42] he says if the natural laws of God which
[37:46] is electricity and these things are
[37:49] honest and controlled in the correct way
[37:51] to do these things how much more the
[37:54] power of God and the Holy Ghost
[37:56] can do once passing through the human
[37:59] heart by faith
[38:03] how long did man take to get to the
[38:06] stage
[38:07] because of research and church and study
[38:10] but faith is as old as time
[38:14] yet man does not want to go to the tried
[38:16] and tested
[38:19] thing that God had given him
[38:21] to empower him
[38:25] now Adam
[38:28] I want three people to read for me today
[38:30] I just want to compare something right
[38:32] we're going to compare the serpent we're
[38:34] going to convey God and we're going to
[38:36] compare Eve
[38:38] all right who wants to play the serpent
[38:40] in this drama
[38:43] nobody
[38:45] amen
[38:48] I want somebody to read Genesis 3 1.
[38:52] right the rameshuri Genesis 3 1.
[38:58] for the Joshua you can read you can play
[39:00] God
[39:01] Genesis 2 16.
[39:07] okay
[39:09] yeah let's ask Mr Sarah to play the eve
[39:13] Genesis 3 verse 2.
[39:16] we're just going to compare
[39:18] some scriptures to see how Satan had
[39:20] sowed his fertility right
[39:23] now yeah that Faith civilization the
[39:26] atmosphere is charged with faith in that
[39:28] Garden
[39:30] right Eve says this thing is bothering
[39:33] me and Adam speaks that mountain
[39:36] out of existence Eve says the sun is too
[39:39] hot here and Adam speaks and he can make
[39:41] a tree grow over ahead
[39:43] and give a shame
[39:45] it's a faith civilization
[39:49] but one day he comes home
[39:52] and he finds this queen he's looking for
[39:54] his Queen
[39:56] Adam looking for his Queen and he finds
[39:59] that in a fallen condition
[40:02] the serpent had deceived like we said on
[40:05] Wednesday
[40:06] because remember the beast at the end
[40:08] will deceive the whole Earth
[40:10] except those names that are written
[40:12] right
[40:14] so here there's the population of two in
[40:17] the Garden of Eden and it deceives 50 of
[40:21] the population he deceives Eve
[40:28] and Eve says that the serpent beguiled
[40:31] me the word beguiled means to be Charmed
[40:34] to be enchanted in a deceptive way
[40:38] he knew how to charm
[40:41] he knew how to Deceiver
[40:45] so the way he presented the word to her
[40:48] caused it to reason let's read brother
[40:49] Ramesh Genesis 3 1.
[40:52] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[40:54] beast of the field which the Lord
[40:57] and he said unto the woman hey and God
[41:00] said they shall not eat of every tree of
[41:03] the God okay stop there
[41:06] he is asking
[41:08] the woman a Christian
[41:10] he's saying as God said You shall not
[41:13] eat of every tree of the garden
[41:16] he knows how to initiate conversation
[41:19] he knows how to work with the human
[41:24] he knows how to start a conversation
[41:29] amen and they are coming with reasonings
[41:31] in the end time
[41:32] so what do you think about the cloud of
[41:34] 63
[41:36] what do you think about Revelation he's
[41:38] trying to open up that channel of
[41:39] communication that's what the shepherd
[41:42] was trying to do
[41:43] he knew if you went directly to the what
[41:45] he was going to tell her
[41:47] she would have shut him down
[41:49] but he's working walking now the
[41:51] reasoning Channel
[41:53] oh
[41:55] he says
[41:57] as God said You shall not eat your
[41:59] favorite tree of the God for the Joshua
[42:01] you read 216 let's see now we're now
[42:05] going back in chapter two to see what
[42:07] God really said
[42:08] Genesis 2 16.
[42:12] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[42:15] really
[42:17] 17
[42:18] out of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[42:20] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[42:24] the day that thou eateth thereof thou
[42:26] shall surely die
[42:27] so God did not say you must eat mustn't
[42:30] eat of every tree
[42:32] right what did God say of every tree you
[42:36] can eat in the garden
[42:37] he said but at the tree of knowledge of
[42:39] Good and Evil thou must not eat so one
[42:42] tree they must not eat
[42:45] and the day you eat day off you shall
[42:47] surely die let's see
[42:49] so that was an interjection to remind
[42:51] you what God really said the question is
[42:54] asked me did God say man was eat not eat
[42:56] of every tree let's see if Eve responds
[42:59] correctly and if she's staying behind
[43:01] the word
[43:04] princess the Sarah from three two and
[43:06] three three
[43:08] [Music]
[43:21] so she answered correctly
[43:23] she quoted back the word of God
[43:26] this was not a deceived Church up until
[43:29] this point
[43:30] this was a woman was under subjection
[43:33] she knew the word of God she says no no
[43:36] she corrected him by her answer and said
[43:39] not every dream
[43:43] we made of all the fruits of the tree in
[43:45] the garden but of the tree which is in
[43:47] the midst of the garden God said You
[43:49] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[43:51] touch it lest you die
[43:54] so she quoted back the word of God
[43:56] correctly
[43:57] this is where Satan now injects his own
[44:01] Doctrine all right
[44:04] and he injects his own reasoning and he
[44:08] takes God's Own word and he puts one
[44:11] word to it
[44:12] and it's a three four now
[44:16] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[44:18] shall not surely die
[44:24] so here is introducing his own teaching
[44:27] and gospel
[44:28] is reasoning a new light that he is
[44:31] presenting
[44:35] and now he goes on to expand
[44:37] his teaching you know how some people do
[44:40] they take one quote of the prophet and
[44:43] they can preach an entire sermon based
[44:45] on the entire imagination
[44:48] foreign
[44:49] we've seen it
[44:51] how many of you can testify
[44:53] they'll take one quote
[44:56] and then the rest of it is vain
[44:57] imaginations
[45:01] watch now what he does he says for God
[45:03] not know in the day that you eat day off
[45:06] then your eyes shall be opened
[45:09] and you shall be as Gods knowing Good
[45:12] and Evil
[45:17] they were already like God yes
[45:22] God said let us make man in our own
[45:25] image and likeness
[45:27] we just explained to you that Adam was
[45:29] an amateur God on the Earth
[45:31] he's saying you shall be like God
[45:36] now he says don't you want to know good
[45:38] and evil
[45:50] Revelation 5 5 says
[45:52] and one of the elders said to me
[45:55] weep not the lion of the tribe of Judah
[45:58] the root of David and prevailed to open
[46:00] the book to loose the seals thereof that
[46:03] word prevailed
[46:06] means to be more powerful
[46:08] or more Superior
[46:13] how did he prevail
[46:15] what was the prevailing walk of the Lamb
[46:21] amen because when Adam lost the title to
[46:24] the Earth So Adam comes looking for his
[46:26] Queen he finds his Queen in a fallen
[46:29] condition he knows that when God comes
[46:32] in the cool of the day he's going to see
[46:34] Eve in this condition and he's going to
[46:36] kill her
[46:40] so in order to save Eve
[46:43] he comes to Eve's rescue
[46:49] amen
[46:51] and he shows his seed into Eve knowing
[46:54] that if his sin isn't if God cannot kill
[46:57] him
[46:59] because that seed is a part of hell
[47:05] so he does the work of a Kinsman
[47:09] to redeem his own bride
[47:12] now I want to tell you that the modern
[47:15] day people would have said
[47:18] divorce Eve
[47:21] but it was not so in the beginning
[47:25] Jesus said out of the oddness of your
[47:27] heart Moses commanded you to give a
[47:29] decree of divorcement
[47:33] was Adam entitled to divorce her
[47:36] did he have grounds to divorcer
[47:40] but it was not so in the beginning
[47:45] amen
[47:49] so he didn't divorce her
[47:52] God can now watch God comes into the
[47:55] garden and he's looking for his children
[47:57] and the Bible says he says Adam Adam
[48:00] where are thou
[48:03] because he couldn't find him in that
[48:05] Faith civilization anymore
[48:08] they were running to and fro in the
[48:10] garden trying to find coverings finally
[48:13] they found fig leaves
[48:14] it's nice big leaves they sold it
[48:17] together and they covered themselves
[48:18] with fig Leaf religion
[48:26] you know the rest of the story you can
[48:28] read it
[48:30] God looking at the condition of man
[48:34] and when man fell
[48:38] he got stripped off his power he got
[48:40] stripped off his inheritance and it went
[48:42] up back to God
[48:45] power over the Earth went back to God
[48:49] amen
[48:51] Fellowship
[48:52] was taken away
[48:55] and man lost eternal life
[49:01] so we see when the title deed went back
[49:04] to the original owner it was placed in
[49:06] the book of redemption and all the names
[49:08] that were supposed to come via the
[49:10] spoken word of Adam these names were
[49:12] placed in the book because these names
[49:14] were the ones that were in the back part
[49:16] of God's mind and these were the names
[49:18] that were predestined from before the
[49:20] foundation of the world
[49:23] amen
[49:25] let's go to the bridge message
[49:28] paragraph 228 talking now I'm skipping
[49:32] here because we got to go over time amen
[49:34] so I'm showing you the work of a
[49:36] redeemer now when God comes in the
[49:38] Garden of Eden he cannot go and do the
[49:41] work of a Kinsman because he's still in
[49:43] spirit form
[49:47] it's not your time for being to be
[49:50] manifested in the flesh
[49:53] everybody is following yes
[49:56] so in order to to to stay is right away
[50:00] because his wealth is so great that he
[50:02] will kill Adam and Eve
[50:04] for disobeying the world
[50:08] but he makes a partial atonement
[50:12] a temporary sacrifice
[50:16] it takes his lamb and he kills the lamb
[50:20] and his wrath is dead
[50:24] and he takes the skin off that lamb
[50:27] and he clothed the children
[50:31] and here they are not clothed bloody
[50:34] bleeding Lamb's skin
[50:37] cloth
[50:39] walking
[50:40] to Eden
[50:42] waiting for judgment
[50:46] amen
[50:48] Hallelujah it says in paragraph 228 the
[50:52] lamb is the only mediator
[50:54] he was the one that came forth he's been
[50:57] back here interceding until his blood
[51:00] out of tone for every person
[51:02] and the lamb knows what's written in the
[51:04] book
[51:06] aren't you glad that he knows your name
[51:08] amen that's why you are seated here this
[51:10] morning because he called my name
[51:13] he knew from the foundation of the world
[51:16] their names were in there so he stood
[51:18] back here and done the medatorial work
[51:21] till everyone that's been put in the
[51:23] book has been redeemed and it's finished
[51:26] [Music]
[51:27] it's a finished work
[51:30] it was the blood of the Lamb or the
[51:35] blood of the Lamb it was the blood of
[51:40] the Lamb
[51:41] amen that rescued me Sanctified me
[51:45] cleanse me delivered me
[51:48] [Music]
[51:49] amen so yes there's one amen the Bible
[51:52] describes him as having seven horns and
[51:55] seven eyes the prophet in 231 will go to
[51:58] describe what these horns are he says
[52:01] that this was the protection
[52:05] to a seven Church ages seven arms with
[52:08] the seven churches
[52:10] the ages because that was the Lamb's
[52:13] protection
[52:14] we didn't make it on our own strength
[52:17] Paul didn't make it in his own strength
[52:19] neither did iranius Martin Luther
[52:21] Colombo Wesley Branham make it on their
[52:24] own strength but it was the protection
[52:26] of the Lamb those seven arms have been
[52:30] protecting the Saints
[52:33] he says he protected his rights on Earth
[52:36] was a God sent group of people that
[52:39] protected sea the Horn of the Lamb
[52:43] aren't you glad that we are under the
[52:45] protection of the arm
[52:47] and the Seven eyes amen seven eyes have
[52:51] been watching
[52:53] two seven Church ages
[52:55] guiding the church what are these seven
[52:58] eyes the seven messengers of God two of
[53:01] the seven Church ages the seven seers
[53:04] amen this lamb had seven arms on each on
[53:07] at an eye amen what is it Christ and his
[53:11] bride
[53:12] Hallelujah
[53:15] amen
[53:17] this should be the name of the Lord
[53:22] did you catch it
[53:25] amen
[53:27] God's protection coming over the church
[53:31] amen let me say it again the lamb had
[53:35] seven horns
[53:38] that's seven olives he says were the
[53:40] seven Church ages
[53:44] and he says seven eyes
[53:48] who are these seven eyes
[53:51] messages
[53:53] Prophets
[53:55] follow my thoughts
[53:57] where is the eyes
[54:00] in the head
[54:02] or in the body
[54:07] hello
[54:08] come on now
[54:10] are these seven messages a part of the
[54:13] Royal Queen of Heaven
[54:16] that's why he emphasizes the next point
[54:19] there and he says Christ and his bride
[54:23] amen
[54:25] the protection is coming
[54:28] via the body
[54:32] that's why you've got to receive a
[54:34] prophet
[54:36] you received a prophet in the name of a
[54:38] prophet shall receive a prophet's reward
[54:42] amen
[54:44] God who is blessing the church
[54:46] God is protecting the church
[54:49] but the protection is coming to the
[54:52] party
[54:53] so you cannot reject the eyes that were
[54:56] coming
[54:59] he says Christ and the bride seven
[55:03] Church ages out of there were seven
[55:05] prophets that were sent forth seven
[55:07] seers the last one must be a Seer
[55:11] amen so we find that no Angelic being go
[55:14] to 238 no Angelic being could take the
[55:17] place either it could only be the bloody
[55:19] Lamb of God that could walk out amen and
[55:23] take this now hear what the prophet says
[55:25] here brother this is the most Sublime
[55:28] thing in the scripture
[55:34] he says out of all scripture
[55:38] this is the most Sublime thing in
[55:41] Scripture
[55:45] because this was supposed to be done in
[55:47] Eden
[55:50] the claiming work
[55:55] the most Sublime thing remember in Eden
[55:58] it was a partial temporary remedy
[56:02] manner to continue
[56:04] powerless on the Earth how many of you
[56:07] know I have for Abraham being Miracles
[56:08] show me in the Bible
[56:10] Isaac bring miracles
[56:12] operating in power and authority
[56:15] show me Jonah
[56:20] did all of him die
[56:21] so they didn't have eternal life
[56:26] so bear that to live
[56:28] for 4 000 years
[56:31] until Jesus Christ came in on the scene
[56:35] powerless
[56:38] the only blessing that man had was
[56:41] because God had made a covenant with men
[56:44] and if they kept his word they would be
[56:46] blessed
[56:47] but they had no Authority and power over
[56:50] the Earth
[56:51] they were dying and going down through
[56:53] the grave
[56:55] so no angel could do it
[56:58] 239 he says it belongs to the lamb
[57:01] God's law required he's the one to hold
[57:04] it he required the Kinsmen Redeemer and
[57:07] the lamb come out holding it he says I
[57:09] am the Kinsman I am the Redeemer I made
[57:12] intercession for them now I have come to
[57:15] claim their rights for them
[57:19] even this morning
[57:21] some people are not taking back their
[57:23] rights
[57:25] but I want you to know that lamb has
[57:26] come to claim it on your behalf
[57:29] amen the lamb has already claimed you're
[57:32] healing on your behalf now you've got to
[57:34] take it amen
[57:37] listen to what he says I've come to
[57:39] claim their rights for them
[57:42] because there was just a search down and
[57:44] you couldn't go and claim it
[57:45] I can't Proclaim it on their behalf
[57:48] amen there's only one I've come to claim
[57:52] their rights they have a right to
[57:53] everything that lost in the fall I've
[57:55] paid the price
[57:57] I am the mediator my blood was shed I
[58:00] have become man and I did this in order
[58:02] to get that church back again
[58:05] the one I first saw before the
[58:07] foundation of the world I purposed it I
[58:10] spoke it amen nobody was able to take it
[58:12] but I went down and done it myself I am
[58:16] the Kinsman I become kinsful and he
[58:19] takes the book
[58:21] 243 he says what a Sublime statement
[58:26] or act
[58:27] Sublime means inspirational beautiful
[58:34] amen
[58:39] so we do not have to give our allegiance
[58:41] to the Pope
[58:43] we do not have to give our allegiance to
[58:45] the Imam
[58:46] the grand Iman
[58:48] do you know just September
[58:50] in September they met again and they
[58:53] signed the final document
[58:57] I'm talking about the religious world
[58:58] right the pope met with all the leaders
[59:00] of the world
[59:01] so what the prophet prophesied that the
[59:05] spoke will do they have signed the final
[59:07] document
[59:10] I want you to go listen to it
[59:12] the final document that was signed where
[59:15] the pope is speaking
[59:18] and watch how they're addressing
[59:20] governments
[59:22] and they're telling politicians what
[59:24] they expect of them
[59:27] right the last time we preached on this
[59:29] we we just we told you that
[59:31] in order to control the world's
[59:33] population you cannot control them
[59:35] through politics
[59:39] because man is very religious
[59:42] them billions of Catholics
[59:44] millions of Muslims Christians so if you
[59:48] control them through religion
[59:51] it's easier than controlling them
[59:53] because politics is one man's idea you
[59:55] got Democrats you've got Republicans you
[59:57] got the Socialists you've got so many
[59:59] different things going on
[1:00:01] but when they come now and they say that
[1:00:03] we are all of one religion we all serve
[1:00:06] the same God
[1:00:08] we can unite under this
[1:00:13] why are you fussing about
[1:00:16] he's saying all of us are praying to the
[1:00:18] one God
[1:00:19] that's what the pope is saying
[1:00:23] and you know about that new church
[1:00:26] that's being built where they got a
[1:00:27] mosque you know a church
[1:00:30] and a Jewish temple the synagogue right
[1:00:35] I know
[1:00:36] so when is 255 let's go quick now and
[1:00:39] close up he says
[1:00:43] let's follow this now sometimes you know
[1:00:45] the property same things but we got to
[1:00:46] read it slow
[1:00:48] he says now he comes from here at this
[1:00:51] last seal
[1:00:55] did you get it
[1:00:59] what is the last seal
[1:01:01] there's only seven right
[1:01:03] Seven Seals
[1:01:04] so it's the seventh seal
[1:01:07] so is that now
[1:01:10] apart
[1:01:13] so what is he talking about Revelation 5
[1:01:15] coming to take the book claim it
[1:01:17] so Revelation 5 is linked to Revelation
[1:01:20] 10 bringing the book to the Earth yes so
[1:01:23] the last seal is what there was silence
[1:01:25] in heaven for about the space of half an
[1:01:28] hour but we are not seeing the silence
[1:01:30] right now because everyone is screaming
[1:01:34] they're shouting
[1:01:35] Worthy is the Lamb because that was
[1:01:37] slain so that's not the silence in
[1:01:40] Revelation 5. Revelation is very noisy
[1:01:45] right but he's tying this to that
[1:01:47] seventh seal there's something that
[1:01:49] causes heaven to be silent yes
[1:01:53] he says and now he comes from here at
[1:01:55] the last at this last seal his normal
[1:01:57] mediator he is King now what does he do
[1:02:00] if he's King he has to have subjects by
[1:02:03] God's grace I believe some of them are
[1:02:05] sitting here this morning
[1:02:06] and his subjects his name that has been
[1:02:09] redeemed have we been redeemed amen
[1:02:12] they cannot come before him until he
[1:02:14] takes the rights of redemption now he
[1:02:16] walks forth from a mediator where death
[1:02:19] put us in the grave he comes forth with
[1:02:22] the rights
[1:02:23] amen then 266
[1:02:27] he says the seals was broke in the last
[1:02:29] Church age
[1:02:31] so now he's typing
[1:02:33] something here
[1:02:35] when was the seals broke in the LA in
[1:02:38] the seven churches to reveal these truth
[1:02:40] the lamb broke the seals revealed it to
[1:02:43] his church in order to collect his
[1:02:45] subjects for his kingdom
[1:02:47] his brain he wants to bring his subjects
[1:02:51] to him now
[1:02:53] 268 he comes to get his subjects he
[1:02:57] revealed his Secrets they saw it amen
[1:03:00] amen amen yes
[1:03:04] you got it 268. listen to what he says
[1:03:07] he came he came to get his subjects did
[1:03:10] he hear him come
[1:03:12] or church yes
[1:03:15] did he come to get his subjects
[1:03:18] he revealed his Secrets yes
[1:03:21] was the mystery of God revealed amen and
[1:03:24] all the other lucians
[1:03:26] and they saw it
[1:03:30] where is he now if you read the next
[1:03:32] line you know exactly what chapter he's
[1:03:33] in and he says at and time is no more at
[1:03:37] that time
[1:03:39] he's in Revelation 10.
[1:03:41] when the angel lifts up his hand to
[1:03:43] heaven
[1:03:45] he says time has run out it's finished
[1:03:47] he leaves the throne to be an
[1:03:49] intercessor as a slain lamb to be a lion
[1:03:52] king to bring the world to judgment who
[1:03:55] has rejected his message yes
[1:03:58] amen
[1:04:01] follow his thought now
[1:04:04] amen the prophet says when he came down
[1:04:07] to execute amateur tribulation upon the
[1:04:10] people
[1:04:12] amen
[1:04:13] Hallelujah
[1:04:15] let me tell you something if it had not
[1:04:17] been for Revelation 10 the serpent at
[1:04:19] the end would have swept you up
[1:04:22] look at all the churches are deceived
[1:04:25] but I want you to know amen as he was
[1:04:27] about to deceive you
[1:04:30] and come to make his final move on you
[1:04:33] down comes the angel of Revelation 10
[1:04:36] and he shuts those beasts up
[1:04:39] [Music]
[1:04:49] amen
[1:04:50] now watch if you didn't catch what I was
[1:04:52] saying there how did he infiltrate Eden
[1:04:55] through a serpent how was he
[1:04:57] infiltrating the nations of the earth
[1:04:59] and deceiving them through true beasts
[1:05:02] to the Roman Catholic church and through
[1:05:04] the USA
[1:05:08] because God's Avenue is always to walk
[1:05:10] with man and take me is a copycat so he
[1:05:12] also works through Myan now
[1:05:15] okay so he comes to shut down those two
[1:05:18] systems
[1:05:21] amen answer what until judgment he said
[1:05:24] like Daniel said 272 he says no we're
[1:05:27] not the same shall judge the Earth
[1:05:28] judgment was said books were open Ten
[1:05:32] Thousand Times Ten thousands of
[1:05:33] thousands ministered to him king and
[1:05:35] queen
[1:05:37] and then another book was open which was
[1:05:39] the book of life that's for the church
[1:05:41] and the queen and king stood there
[1:05:44] notice Royal titles being used
[1:05:49] this is the hour
[1:05:51] for the Royal Queen of Heaven and the
[1:05:54] royal king of Heaven to be United amen
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:05] 278 let's just finish on this now he
[1:06:08] says he leaves the throne as an
[1:06:10] intercessor right bring to bring the
[1:06:12] world into judgment
[1:06:15] now watch I gotta drop this in quickly
[1:06:18] so that you tie it in
[1:06:20] when the prophet
[1:06:21] is receiving these messages
[1:06:26] and you remember you threw that rock up
[1:06:28] in the air
[1:06:29] and he says judgment is fixing to strike
[1:06:32] right and he says Alaska almost sunk
[1:06:36] he says that was amateur tribulations
[1:06:40] and he says and it won't stop
[1:06:45] okay
[1:06:46] so if you're wondering where's
[1:06:48] tribulation what do you think is going
[1:06:50] on in the world right now
[1:06:52] now the reason why we are focusing on
[1:06:54] this if Russia is so fixed on fulfilling
[1:06:58] their part of the prophecy
[1:07:00] if the U.S is so fixed on fulfilling
[1:07:04] their part of the prophecy if the pope
[1:07:06] is so fixed and they are hard at work in
[1:07:09] uniting all the religions of the world
[1:07:11] and fulfilling their part of the
[1:07:13] prophecy
[1:07:15] this bride must be fixed and set her
[1:07:19] heart on her part of the prophecy
[1:07:22] amen amen
[1:07:25] he says here in choose 279 then claims
[1:07:28] his inheritance what's his inheritance
[1:07:30] the church the bride he claims it
[1:07:33] in 280 then he disposes of his
[1:07:36] contestant Satan he throws him in the
[1:07:38] lake of fire with all those things which
[1:07:40] inspired by Satan to reject
[1:07:43] his word of redemption
[1:07:45] he is King now Mercy is still on the
[1:07:47] throne
[1:07:49] oh for those of you who thought I was
[1:07:51] saying that when he left the throne and
[1:07:53] mercy was over
[1:07:54] no no no no no no
[1:07:56] Mercy is wherever the lamb goes
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:02] amen
[1:08:06] isn't he's telling you now
[1:08:08] he's King now Mercy is still on the
[1:08:10] throne
[1:08:12] don't you reject his offer
[1:08:14] even this morning don't you reject his
[1:08:16] offer
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:20] so you can you can read what a time of
[1:08:22] rejoicing there was in heaven now to
[1:08:25] bring this to a close let's close this
[1:08:27] now in maybe a minute or two
[1:08:31] Adam was looking for his Queen
[1:08:34] and he found it in the Fallen condition
[1:08:38] when this bride when this
[1:08:40] last Adam he's not the second Adam the
[1:08:42] Bible called him actually the last era
[1:08:45] when this last Adam comes in the end of
[1:08:47] time
[1:08:49] the church is supposed to be built out
[1:08:50] for seven Church ages and he comes
[1:08:53] looking for his Queen
[1:08:55] he finds it in a condition
[1:08:59] miserable wretched naked blind
[1:09:03] and the Bible says you don't even know
[1:09:06] it
[1:09:08] and he's knocking at the door
[1:09:10] open up to me
[1:09:16] trying to cover herself
[1:09:20] but there's a very significant portion
[1:09:22] let's go to Revelation 3 22 then 321.
[1:09:27] there's a portion there that is tied to
[1:09:30] us because there's a remedy for that
[1:09:33] woman that's in that condition
[1:09:37] and that's what we have done
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:53] let's go to verse 18.
[1:09:57] so 17 says talks about the woman and the
[1:10:00] condition she was in right saying I'm
[1:10:02] increased with Goods that need of
[1:10:03] nothing but thou wretched miserable poor
[1:10:05] blind naked but here's the remedy
[1:10:08] I counsel of Thee
[1:10:10] just like Adam
[1:10:12] didn't put away Eve
[1:10:14] he was trying to reason with him
[1:10:17] he says I counsel of Thee
[1:10:20] bye of me gold tried in the fire
[1:10:23] that thou makes me Rich
[1:10:27] white Raymond that thou Mays be clothed
[1:10:32] that the shame of your nakedness do not
[1:10:35] appear
