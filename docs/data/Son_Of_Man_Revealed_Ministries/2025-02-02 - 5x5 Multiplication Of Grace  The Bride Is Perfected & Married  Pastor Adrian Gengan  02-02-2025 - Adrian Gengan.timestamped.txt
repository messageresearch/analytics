[0:00] the Bible this morning last week we were
[0:01] speaking on Grace needs
[0:03] Perfection and we were showing you how
[0:05] Jacob was making his journey to Joseph
[0:09] and we know that Jacob was typing
[0:11] Grace and Joseph Perfection amen Amen
[0:15] brother Brenham said whatever seed
[0:16] started the church that's what will come
[0:18] forth at the arst time so Jacob was the
[0:21] form of the seed and but when he was
[0:23] coming to Joseph he was coming to
[0:25] Perfection amen amen that's the time we
[0:28] at now amen praise the Lord so we're
[0:30] going to speak on Amen multiplication of
[0:33] grace and the way I'm going to say the
[0:35] next part because I want the bride to
[0:37] start to understand that the bride is
[0:39] already perfected and already married
[0:42] thank you Lord that is not a future work
[0:45] yes amen the Rapture is not taking you
[0:47] to a marriage Rapture is taking you to
[0:49] the marriage
[0:50] supper so if we are called under the
[0:53] shout message that's a message calling
[0:56] you giving you a message to prepare
[0:57] that's Revelation 19:7 the bride makes
[1:00] himself ready but in Matthew 25 we know
[1:03] the bride bridegroom comes he opens the
[1:05] door he pulls the bride in to the
[1:07] shout amen and them that are without oil
[1:11] on the outside so let's read our
[1:12] scripture amen we're speaking at 5 * 5
[1:15] is a multiplicate because we know five
[1:17] is the number of Grace amen so if you
[1:20] multiply
[1:22] Grace that's 5 * five yes amen it's a
[1:26] multiplication of Grace yes the bride is
[1:28] perfected and married in the this time
[1:30] amen John 1:16
[1:32] says and of his fullness have we all
[1:36] received and Grace for Grace amen and of
[1:41] his fullness have we all received and
[1:45] Grace for grace verse 17 says for the
[1:48] law was given by
[1:50] Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus
[1:54] Christ amen hallelujah thankful amen
[1:57] that we are living under the
[1:59] dispensation of Jesus Christ now amen
[2:02] not by the law of Moses because we are
[2:04] living in the time of Grace and Truth
[2:06] praise the
[2:08] Lord and we go to Zechariah chap 4
[2:16] amen Zechariah 4 from verse 5 says then
[2:20] the angel that talked with me answered
[2:23] and said unto me amen I'm so glad that
[2:26] Angels so talk to us am am we've got to
[2:29] be in communication with the Unseen
[2:31] World then the angel that talked with me
[2:33] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[2:35] not what these be and I said no my Lord
[2:38] then he answered and spake unto me
[2:40] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[2:42] zerubabel saying not by might not by
[2:46] power but by my spirit say the Lord of
[2:49] hosts who art thou oh great Mountain
[2:52] before zerubabel thou shall become a
[2:54] plane amen that's a son coming into
[2:57] position who can speak to mountains yes
[2:59] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[3:01] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[3:05] Grace amen unto it so multiplication of
[3:08] Grace at this end time cry yes amen I
[3:11] want to put a timeline to it I want to
[3:12] put a date to it and tell you that's
[3:14] 1963 the Shar message coming when those
[3:17] Angels Came From Heaven bringing a
[3:19] message to brother Bram and shoutings of
[3:21] Grace Grace because remember Revelation
[3:24] 10 is a setting for judgment but it's
[3:26] also bringing grace to the bride so it's
[3:29] judgment to the but grace to the bride
[3:31] same thing in Genesis 18
[3:33] amen moreover the word of the Lord came
[3:35] to me saying the hands of zerubabel have
[3:38] laid the foundation of this house his
[3:40] hand shall also finish it and thou shalt
[3:42] know that the Lord of hosts had sent me
[3:45] unto you for who had despised the day of
[3:48] small things when he started in 1946 in
[3:51] a cave who can despise those things amen
[3:55] hallelujah for there shall be rejoicing
[3:57] amen and they shall see the plummet in
[3:59] the hand of zerubabel have we seen the
[4:02] plummet in the hand of zerubabel Amen
[4:04] Hallelujah with those seven the they are
[4:07] the eyes of the Lord which run to and
[4:10] fro from the whole earth amen praise the
[4:12] Lord you may be
[4:22] seated if you can put up Matthew 2510
[4:25] want to read this
[4:26] amen I think it's very important we
[4:29] understand the time of and season we
[4:30] living in because you know there was
[4:32] three quarts to the temple amen there
[4:35] was the outer the inner and the holiest
[4:37] of holies amen so if you read the story
[4:42] and the parable of the five wise and the
[4:43] five foolish amen the bride has
[4:47] progressed she's no
[4:50] longer amen we've been saying this for a
[4:52] few weeks now I'm just reiterating she's
[4:54] no longer wise
[4:56] virgins with oil in the lamp outside the
[4:58] door
[5:03] amen remember the holiest of holies is
[5:06] where the bride needs to be yes amen
[5:08] shut in into that secret place Amen in
[5:10] the Shak of glory amen now how can you
[5:13] carry your lamp light and go into Shak
[5:16] Glory lamp light Candlestick light was
[5:18] in the second Court everybody agree so
[5:22] we can't be in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[5:24] come under the shout message and claim
[5:26] to be wise virgins carrying oil in our
[5:27] lamp walking through Lea no the shout
[5:31] came to open a door to us and pull us
[5:33] into the marriage can somebody say Amen
[5:35] yes amen so we got to know where we
[5:38] are and while they went to buy the
[5:41] bridegroom came did he come yes come on
[5:44] now Jesus does all three things as he's
[5:47] descending first he comes in a shout so
[5:49] it's Jesus in the shout yesen the
[5:52] bridegroom came and they that we already
[5:54] went in with him to the marriage amen
[5:58] that happens here on the Earth
[6:00] yesen amen and the door was shut so
[6:03] therefore denominations denominations
[6:05] can't understand the shout they can't
[6:08] enter this dimensional door of the shot
[6:09] that's open to the bride you can break
[6:12] your head you can even take coconut and
[6:13] break they will never see it if they are
[6:15] not predestinated amen amen so it's a
[6:18] door only open to the bride and we'll
[6:21] read this quote now in proving his word
[6:23] he says it's the son of man Jesus Christ
[6:26] will come down in human flesh amongst us
[6:29] and will make his word so real it will
[6:31] unite the church and him as one the
[6:34] bride and then she'll go home to the
[6:36] wedding supper now this is the point I
[6:39] want to get to she's already united we
[6:42] go to the wedding supper not to the
[6:44] marriage yes amen amen
[6:48] hallelujah so right now we are being
[6:50] united with the word the invisible Union
[6:54] amen hallelujah of the Heavenly
[6:57] bridegroom and the Earthly bride praise
[7:00] the
[7:01] Lord now a very important scripture I
[7:03] want to read this is Malachi 4: 5 and 6
[7:06] amen I want the young people to also
[7:09] amen start to learn these scriptures
[7:12] these are very fun fundamental
[7:14] scriptures to our belief and our
[7:16] revelation of the hour Malachi 4:5 says
[7:20] behold I will send you Elijah the
[7:23] prophet three people involved here God
[7:25] the bride and a prophet so God is
[7:28] talking to the bride here
[7:30] I will send you Elijah the prophet
[7:32] before the coming of the great and
[7:34] Dreadful day of the Lord and you shall
[7:36] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[7:38] children and the Heart of the children
[7:40] to their fathers lest they come and
[7:42] smite the Earth with a curse amen so we
[7:45] showed you that last week how when
[7:46] Joseph sent the brothers back to Jacob
[7:49] his heart was turned back to the
[7:52] children The Father's Heart was turned
[7:54] back to the children
[7:55] there because he had no confidence in
[7:58] them but finally when they started to
[8:00] minister to him his heart was turned
[8:03] back to them and he sent Benjamin with
[8:05] them showing you the first part of that
[8:07] prophecy and the second time the heart
[8:10] of the father children returned back to
[8:12] the fathers was when Jacob came and met
[8:15] Joseph praise the Lord
[8:18] amen one more Point I've got to read
[8:21] again a quote because I'm building up
[8:23] here brother brandom says we've read
[8:25] this before God stands on the promised
[8:28] word for each New Year amen so if you
[8:31] want to live on the Promises of last
[8:32] year that's fine with me but the prophet
[8:35] is saying in the message Shalom God
[8:36] stands on the promised word for each New
[8:38] Year
[8:40] yes he stands on it this year to fulfill
[8:44] what he got promised for the last 60
[8:46] years
[8:48] no he's saying to fulfill what he has
[8:51] got promised for this
[8:53] year whatever it is I want to be right
[8:55] in the center of his will in the future
[8:58] like they did
[9:00] right in paragraph 190 he says so the
[9:03] new year is determined by God just
[9:06] determined to stay in his word walk
[9:08] where the word says walk amen so the
[9:12] reason we are saying that we don't want
[9:14] to miss anything any promise of God Amen
[9:17] that he has got stored up for this year
[9:20] we want to be a faithful Steward that
[9:22] wants to unlock all of the promises of
[9:24] God for this
[9:25] year amen
[9:27] hallelujah so brother Brandon we read
[9:30] now in Zechariah 4:6 that the prophet is
[9:33] saying not by power not by might but by
[9:36] my spirit say the Lord now the prophet
[9:39] is going to Define that let's see what
[9:41] he says in the message of Grace he says
[9:44] the seventh Church messenger was to
[9:47] restore the faith of the children back
[9:49] to the fathers that's Malachi 4 verse 6
[9:52] said everybody agree we just read it now
[9:55] watch how he defines it he says in other
[9:57] words rebuild the church again under the
[10:02] power of the
[10:03] spirit not to bring you to some theology
[10:06] Malachi for's message is to turn your
[10:09] heart back to the
[10:10] faith amen and he's saying here he's
[10:13] defining it that is to be under the
[10:16] power of the spirit not to make us
[10:18] intellectual people but to be led by the
[10:21] Holy Ghost amen amen praise the Lord he
[10:24] goes on to say not by power not by might
[10:27] but by my spirit say the Lord not by
[10:30] organization not by Den denomination but
[10:33] by the holy spirit hallah amen God will
[10:36] bring forth the church in the last day
[10:39] amen so amen hallelujah the Bride of
[10:42] Jesus Christ like we said in Matthew 25
[10:45] uh symbol amen is the Holy Ghost she is
[10:47] filled with the Holy
[10:49] Ghost there was a big distinction the
[10:52] reason why the foolish could identify
[10:54] the Bride of Jesus Christ as having the
[10:56] Holy Ghost is because they are the gifts
[10:58] but they are the GI of the
[11:00] gifts amen they were reading from the
[11:03] word but she was the word made flesh so
[11:06] they were asking the bride give us this
[11:08] word that's making you flesh and they
[11:10] said we can't give it to you because
[11:12] this thinging comes under a Shar message
[11:15] so you got to come out your prophetic
[11:16] gift to receive this Holy
[11:20] Ghost
[11:21] amen thank you Lord amen thank you
[11:26] Jesus I'm saying it again the bride that
[11:29] be become flesh amen which means she was
[11:32] tabernacling the Holy Ghost amen
[11:34] hallelujah the second full mystery
[11:36] purpose was already in fulfillment
[11:38] Christ was now veiled in his bride
[11:41] amen hallelujah because he won't marry
[11:45] anything beside the word come on Church
[11:47] Christ won't marry anything beside the
[11:49] word so if you open up the door to us
[11:51] and pull us into the marriage the bride
[11:52] is already been perfected and not by our
[11:55] own works but by his grace I think
[11:57] somebody ought to praise the Lord amen
[11:59] yes
[12:00] Lord oh Hallelujah Christ is not coming
[12:03] to do a further work to perfect us all
[12:05] that was needed to perfect us was
[12:07] already done amen you go look up the
[12:10] word justification amen if you're still
[12:12] struggling with sin or still trying to
[12:14] see yourself as imperfect you need to go
[12:16] and read that amen that when you are
[12:17] Justified is as though you've never done
[12:19] it in the first place amen amen thank
[12:22] you Lord praise the Lord hallelujah
[12:25] amen now when the Lord comes to the Lord
[12:28] will you make thinking why is the Lord
[12:30] reminding you of stuff why is the Lord
[12:32] reminding you amen
[12:34] hallelujah the Lord that's how God is
[12:37] he's a god of
[12:39] multiplication he's a god of Grace amen
[12:42] when he came to Noah he says Noah you
[12:44] have found Grace in my eyes it wasn't
[12:47] that Noah was living a righteous life
[12:50] that God said oh this man is so
[12:51] righteous I'll save him the Bible says
[12:53] Noah found
[12:55] Grace Hallelujah when they sin there in
[12:58] Eden and and the darkness amen swept
[13:00] through Eden that
[13:02] day chaos
[13:04] death Grace came in on the
[13:07] scene praise the
[13:09] Lord oh hallelujah amen so God will
[13:13] remind us because of his grace let's
[13:15] just go to Genesis CH 32 and verse
[13:19] 27 here we find Jacob wrestling with the
[13:23] angel amen so I I want to show you in
[13:26] this very short verses that sometimes
[13:29] truth is revealed to someone
[13:31] identification is revealed to someone
[13:33] but it takes them some time for them to
[13:35] walk in that revelation of things but
[13:37] God is gracious and patient and will
[13:40] keep reminding us thank you Lord here
[13:43] Jacob is wrestling with the angel and
[13:45] you know he doesn't want to let the
[13:46] angel go it's about time for amen for
[13:48] Sunrise and the angel says you've got to
[13:51] let me go and he says I won't let you go
[13:53] till you bless me and now the angel says
[13:55] to him in verse 27 he said unto him what
[13:57] is thy name
[13:59] and he said Jacob all name all nature
[14:03] name represents nature
[14:06] character 28 and he said thy name shall
[14:09] be called No More Jacob but Israel
[14:13] amenah for as a prince has the power
[14:16] with God and with men and has prevailed
[14:20] finish work when Christ tells you who
[14:22] you are when Christ reveals your
[14:24] identity he's not going to tell you you
[14:26] will prevail he's saying you have
[14:28] prevailed am it's a finished work amen
[14:32] praise the
[14:33] [Music]
[14:35] Lord now watch again there the angel
[14:39] revealing that he's going to change his
[14:40] name now in 35 and verse 9 chapter
[14:44] 35 and God appeared unto Jacob
[14:48] again when he came out of bed Dam and
[14:51] blessed him and God said unto him thy
[14:54] name is
[14:55] Jacob thy name shall not be called
[14:58] anymore Jacob now didn't God tell him
[15:04] that but God is reminding him you are
[15:07] not walking in the revelation of your
[15:09] name oh yes help us Lord amen we don't
[15:13] have any denominational name attached to
[15:15] us we are the bride the M Jesus Christ
[15:17] amen Lord and until we get into the
[15:20] Revelation to realize who we are we'll
[15:22] be walking around like Esther being
[15:24] married to the king but not in a
[15:26] position fearful to go into the presence
[15:28] of the king
[15:32] that's why you need the voice of morah
[15:34] the voice of the seventh angel
[15:35] thundering out amen reminding you that
[15:38] you've been called for such a time as
[15:39] this amen Esther was married Esther was
[15:43] having Royal robes Esther was living in
[15:45] luxury in the palace but she was fearful
[15:47] to go in the presence of the king this
[15:49] bride of Jesus Christ must never be
[15:51] fearful to come into the presence of the
[15:53] king but we have an exess and we must
[15:55] come boldly into his presence
[15:59] Hallelujah in fact it upsets the king if
[16:02] we stay out of his
[16:04] presence amen we were telling you the
[16:06] other day amen hallelujah when you come
[16:08] into CH kind of Glory that's the
[16:10] presence of the Sun so you can't have
[16:13] sunscreen please don't use sunscreen and
[16:16] come in the presence of the
[16:17] sun hallelujah amen amen that sunscreen
[16:22] I can say is
[16:24] unbelief praise the Lord now here
[16:27] reminding you now the Lord is coming to
[16:29] Jacob the second time and telling him
[16:31] thy name is Jacob thy name shall not be
[16:34] called anymore Jacob but Israel shall be
[16:36] thy name and he called his name Israel
[16:40] and God said unto him I am God Almighty
[16:43] what is going to confirm the Covenant
[16:46] now be fruitful and multiply amen a
[16:52] nation and a company of Nations shall be
[16:54] out of thee and King shall come out of
[16:56] thy loins and the land which I gave AB
[16:58] abam and
[17:00] Isaac to thee I will give
[17:03] it you see why he couldn't go based on
[17:07] his father's Covenant God will come
[17:10] personally to you and confirm with you
[17:12] amen hallelujah it must be a oneon-one
[17:15] experience he may have heard of the
[17:16] Covenant of Abraham he may have heard of
[17:18] the Covenant with his father amen Israel
[17:21] amen Isaac but now until he meet God
[17:23] face to face until you meet God on that
[17:26] sacred SS amen that's the time you'll
[17:28] only be convinced and then
[17:30] concerned other than that you hearing
[17:33] about a holy ghost in feeling other than
[17:35] that you hearing amen about amen the
[17:37] shout message and you being caught into
[17:39] this dimension of the shout and being
[17:41] changed under rapturing Faith but until
[17:44] he comes to revealed to you your new
[17:46] name amen what's tell me what's given at
[17:49] the marriage beside
[17:52] ring you take on the
[17:54] husband's name so if we just read that
[17:57] the marriage takes place here on the
[17:59] earth if there is a marriage between
[18:01] Christ and the bride there's got to be a
[18:03] name change you got to die to your own
[18:05] nature you got to die to your own
[18:07] character you got to amen be able to say
[18:09] Lord you are now my
[18:11] head we don't Christ don't want any
[18:14] independent woman you can't iate your
[18:17] name and take on the name of Jesus
[18:20] Christ Hallelujah you can't be Benjamin
[18:24] Maru praise the Lord but you've got to
[18:27] forsake all your rights
[18:29] you've got to forsake all your past
[18:31] remember what Rebecca did she left
[18:33] everything behind to be United with
[18:37] Isaac praise the Lord so we've got to
[18:39] leave all unbelief we've got to leave
[18:41] all of our amen things that we are
[18:43] meddling with the world and things that
[18:45] we've got amen our hands in the world
[18:47] and and no total surrender you we as a
[18:50] people would know the things we are
[18:52] still holding on
[18:53] to that's right Hallelujah like they
[18:56] would say enter your pockets
[18:59] let me see what's in your pockets praise
[19:02] the
[19:03] lord we can't come into Jesus Christ
[19:06] marriage with things in our pockets with
[19:08] golden wages amen
[19:13] hallelujah so are we seeing the grace of
[19:16] the Lord amen he's coming to remind
[19:19] Jacob of his
[19:23] name and then he's also giving him a
[19:27] covenant in verse 13 and God went up
[19:29] from him in the place where he talked to
[19:37] them now I want you to also understand
[19:40] this is before he has any children in
[19:43] things this brother Jacob goes on living
[19:48] his entire life even after two
[19:50] confirmation that his name is Israel
[19:53] still going by the name of
[19:56] Jacob amen
[19:59] now watch your Beginnings because your
[20:00] Beginnings are important this boy grew
[20:03] up with his mother and
[20:06] father it was not the desire of Jacob to
[20:09] trick his father into giving him the
[20:11] blessing if you read the story Rebecca
[20:14] is the one who told him to do this amen
[20:17] amen so what you SE into your children
[20:20] they will start to learn those ways
[20:22] Rebecca is the one that cooked the meal
[20:24] Rebecca is the one that told your hands
[20:26] are too fine you need to get the thing
[20:28] and put on your hands Rebecca is the one
[20:31] that coed him
[20:35] yes amen so he goes on living this way
[20:40] you'll see he goes and he tricks his
[20:42] father-in-law he goes and he tricks he's
[20:45] living a life now of deception
[20:47] everywhere he goes this thing is
[20:49] ingrained in him so much so that he now
[20:52] filters down to his children his
[20:54] children come to him with fake blood on
[20:57] a cloth and they're lying to their
[20:59] father they don't even tell their father
[21:01] this is Joseph's blood they just show it
[21:04] to him and he makes his own conclusion
[21:06] that is my son's blood so he lives for
[21:09] the next what we said 25
[21:12] years thinking that Joseph is dead he's
[21:16] living under a self- deluded deception a
[21:19] self-inflicted deception that Joseph is
[21:23] dead and all this time he's being
[21:26] considered under his own name his own
[21:28] name nature imagine living for 25 years
[21:31] in
[21:34] deception being fooled by your own
[21:36] children now this is where we're want to
[21:39] get to that's why I related that now
[21:41] when Joseph sends back a message to his
[21:45] father he sends them back with
[21:49] chariots Joseph's
[21:51] chariots and we we were typing that the
[21:54] last time that the wagons the Chariots
[21:56] of Joseph was the message of the hour M
[21:59] just like how the camels went to pack
[22:01] amen Rebecca Joseph sent the Chariots
[22:05] Perfection had sent a message is Joseph
[22:08] Perfection was this message coming from
[22:10] Joseph so was it a message from
[22:12] Perfection amen amen and he was and and
[22:15] we read it now from verse chapter 45: 26
[22:19] and they told him Joseph is yet
[22:23] alive amen and he is governor of all of
[22:26] the land of Egypt now watch the the
[22:28] Bible how it records it it doesn't say
[22:29] Israel and Jacob's heart fainted for he
[22:32] believed them
[22:34] not first they told him Joseph he they
[22:36] they presented remember the court of
[22:38] Many Colors with the blood he believed
[22:40] them Joseph was dead now they come back
[22:43] with the news 25 years later and they
[22:45] tell him Joseph is
[22:47] alive and he doesn't believe
[22:52] them and they told him all the words of
[22:55] Joseph
[22:57] [Music]
[22:59] which he had said unto
[23:01] them but the words alone is not enough
[23:03] watch what happened when he saw the
[23:05] wagons the Chariots which Joseph had
[23:08] sent to carry him the message of the
[23:11] hour amen come on now amen when he saw
[23:15] the type of
[23:17] transportation that was sent to take him
[23:19] to
[23:20] Perfection when you see the message of
[23:23] the hour you know this is not any
[23:25] ordinary message this message couldn't
[23:27] come from a seventh grade amen Prophet
[23:29] Kent
[23:30] Prophet when we saw the message of the
[23:33] hour we said no wait something is up
[23:36] here where did my sons get this Chariot
[23:39] where did you get this book from
[23:41] hallelujah amen where did you get that
[23:43] Revelation from amen something is up
[23:46] here amen what was happening his heart
[23:48] was being turned back amen it was the
[23:51] message of Malachi 4 coming to him and
[23:53] see what happens here when he saw the
[23:55] message of the hour which Joseph had
[23:57] sent to car him the spirit of Jacob
[24:00] their father revived amen this man came
[24:03] alive amen he was dead in his spirit
[24:06] because he loved Joseph amen but when he
[24:08] heard that Joseph is alive amen his
[24:11] Spirit revived within
[24:14] him and watch how now suddenly the Bible
[24:18] uses his new name and Israel's here
[24:21] because amen that was the message of the
[24:23] hour because the seventh SS take out all
[24:26] Amnesia he now recognizes is Israel and
[24:29] the Bible says and Israel said it is
[24:32] enough Joseph my son is yet alive and I
[24:35] will go and see him before I die amen
[24:39] hallelujah so God won't leave you till
[24:41] you live in the fullness of your name
[24:44] till you live in the fullness of your
[24:46] promise God will keep coming in the
[24:48] multiplication of Grace he keep coming
[24:50] Amen to remind you who you are blessed
[24:53] be your name of God Amen praise the Lord
[24:56] praise the Lord amen hallelujah yes Lord
[24:59] amen hallelujah now if I tell you that
[25:02] the prophet says the second form mystery
[25:04] purpose is Christ having amen the prein
[25:07] in his
[25:09] people amen Christ in Bri form how many
[25:12] of you would say Amen to that hallelujah
[25:16] amen and that's where we are we are not
[25:18] in the path where God is fully revealing
[25:21] himself through Jesus Christ that was
[25:22] the first part second part we know the
[25:26] first part of the second part was God
[25:28] tabernacling William brandom a son of
[25:31] man revealing the son of man amen amen
[25:33] hallelujah but now that was now to bring
[25:36] the bride into Union with Christ now
[25:38] he's tabernacling his
[25:41] bride
[25:43] Hallelujah so if I say that way people
[25:46] can stomach it they say God is revealing
[25:49] himself to his bride God is expressing
[25:51] himself to his bride but if we say it
[25:54] another way that the Holy Ghost is
[25:55] becoming flesh in US amen yes
[26:00] yes now remember what we said before as
[26:03] well the Holy Ghost is not a new thing
[26:06] Redemption is to bring back what was
[26:09] originally lost yes
[26:12] amen yes sir so God is not bringing the
[26:15] Holy Ghost now as a new
[26:18] thing because Adam lost the title
[26:21] de so which means the Holy Ghost himself
[26:24] was personified in Adam because
[26:27] Redemption must bring back that which
[26:29] was lost that's why on the day of
[26:30] Pentecost it was the most exciting time
[26:33] because For the First Time amen after
[26:35] 4,000 years the Holy Ghost could return
[26:38] and dwell in a people amen praise the
[26:41] Lord yes amen Ephesians 3:19 you say how
[26:45] we going to have the fullness let's take
[26:46] it from the Bible Ephesians 3:19 and to
[26:49] know the love of Christ which passes
[26:52] knowledge that you might be filled with
[26:55] all the what fullness
[26:58] amen we might be filled with the
[27:00] fullness of God you see we put
[27:03] limitations on ourselves and say the
[27:05] fullness can't be in US it can only be
[27:07] we are talking about the bride
[27:08] collectively now all of us have it in
[27:10] measure but when this bride is quickly
[27:12] framed together amen peace upon peace
[27:15] amen hone together coming now to the
[27:18] top it's the fullness of
[27:22] God that you might be filled with all
[27:24] the fullness of God now here the prophet
[27:26] is confirming this he it says in the
[27:28] message of Grace and The Headstone was
[27:30] never put in the pyramid we have no
[27:32] machines that could build a pyramid no
[27:35] powers unless it's Atomic power that
[27:37] could build a pyramid because it's too
[27:40] gigantic amen and there we also detailed
[27:44] that that two things were being built at
[27:46] that time one was written in the Bible
[27:49] and detailed and given the blueprint to
[27:50] Noah and told him exactly how to build
[27:54] his ark that was going to take him
[27:56] through the tribulation
[27:58] but it's not recorded how Noah sorry how
[28:01] Enoch built the Pyramid we know Enoch
[28:03] built the Pyramid because the prophet
[28:05] told us Enoch built the Pyramid but
[28:07] remember how does he build a pyramid in
[28:10] silence there's no record of it it's
[28:13] under the seven seiling type that he
[28:15] build a pyramid
[28:19] City amen it's just like What's
[28:22] Happening Now Enoch is a type of the
[28:24] Bride a pyramid city is being built yet
[28:27] is being built in silence praise the
[28:32] Lord stones that weigh tons and tons and
[28:35] tons stands way out in the air so put
[28:38] together that even a thin razor blade
[28:39] could not and they're not cemented
[28:42] remember now they're not even cemented
[28:44] they are just placed
[28:47] there and just so cut so that they Join
[28:50] one another that's the way the body of
[28:52] Christ should be so cut by the Holy
[28:55] Ghost Hallelujah cut by the Holy Ghost
[29:00] amen what is the Holy Ghost God's Great
[29:04] instrument and
[29:06] tool that we be joined as one person
[29:09] we're not divided we should be one
[29:11] person we should be of one mind one
[29:13] Accord amen no mechanics of organization
[29:17] no lodges none of these things could
[29:19] ever do it as good as their intentions
[29:21] are they could never do it because that
[29:24] takes God to do it the Holy Spirit oh
[29:28] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I say
[29:30] we open up ourselves to the holy spirit
[29:32] amen God's Great tool amen
[29:36] hallelujah let the holy spirit amen take
[29:39] on
[29:40] flesh thank you
[29:44] Lord Prophet goes on to say according to
[29:47] the prophecy there will come the edstone
[29:49] remember we're speaking on
[29:51] multiplication of Grace The Headstone
[29:53] will come crying Grace Grace amen and I

[29:59] Headstone come the prince that's going

[38:39] message amen here in Israel and the
[38:42] church the prophet is saying election in
[38:46] Abraham justification in
[38:50] Isaac Grace in
[38:52] Jacob and perfection in
[38:55] Joseph there's not one thing recorded
[38:58] against Joseph that's the Perfection the
[39:01] three Earthly stages of the pilgrimage
[39:03] of the children of Israel and the fourth
[39:05] was when they went into the promised
[39:08] land Hallelujah am amen can you say Amen
[39:11] to
[39:13] that the fourth was when they went into
[39:16] the promised
[39:18] land which was the
[39:21] Millennium and the three stages of the
[39:23] Gentile church this week the Lord
[39:25] willing I will bring it out through the
[39:27] Bible and show that we in our third
[39:30] stage now ready to go into the
[39:32] Millennium in the time of
[39:34] Joseph now I'm going to ask you how do
[39:37] we get to the
[39:41] Millennium there's an order of things to
[39:45] happen in order for us to get to the
[39:47] Millennium according to Bible prophecy
[39:49] Dimensional Doors must open up to
[39:53] us praise the Lord
[39:57] we must go from this Dimension to the
[39:59] seven
[40:01] dimension for the marriage supper
[40:03] everyone can say Amen to them am praise
[40:05] the Lord so Dimensional Doors must open
[40:08] up to
[40:09] us so how does he do it he starts to
[40:13] open up I'm saying this again as I'm
[40:15] closing now God opens up the dimensional
[40:17] door of the shout that they don't know
[40:19] nothing
[40:23] about it's a complete mystery secret yes
[40:26] yes sir remember this pyramid city is
[40:28] being built in
[40:30] silence he opens up the door of the
[40:32] shout which is the message going forth
[40:34] amen he pulls us into into the
[40:38] marriage and we are now United with the
[40:40] word flesh is becoming word and word is
[40:43] becoming
[40:44] flesh that's how we get to the
[40:46] Millennium we've got to enter the shout
[40:49] amen like we were saying last week if
[40:51] you don't enter the shout you can't get
[40:52] to the Trump
[40:57] our part is the shout so which means the
[41:00] Trump is the changing of the body
[41:02] there's no changing of the body without
[41:04] coming to the
[41:05] shout amen hallelujah and we can't
[41:08] access the next realm which is to see
[41:10] our loved ones for 40 days which is the
[41:12] voice of the Resurrection without being
[41:14] in the shout so God has an order of
[41:17] events that's happening and already
[41:19] transpiring now and I tell you again
[41:22] this is no ordinary thing that we are
[41:24] called to the message of the hour we've
[41:26] got to Value it amen we've got to place
[41:28] Great Value upon this P of great price
[41:31] we've got a value that God has seen it
[41:33] fit and that's Grace what I'm talking
[41:34] about we have called into the message
[41:37] because of Grace not by our own works
[41:39] not by our own merits amen nothing that
[41:41] we have done yes but God in his grace
[41:45] God rich in his Mercy said this is my
[41:48] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased to
[41:52] dwell in here he
[41:54] her amen hallelujah
[41:57] now when you are calling to the shout
[42:00] that's when you can hear the love
[42:01] secrets that's when your seat is being
[42:03] dramatized remember in in Shan Glory
[42:08] now there's no other light there
[42:11] yes praise the Lord you're not walking
[42:14] on your own light Hallelujah the priest
[42:17] if he was carrying any light had to
[42:19] leave it yes in the inner
[42:22] Court when he went into the holiest of
[42:24] holies there was no artificial light
[42:27] no lamp light so I'm asking you again
[42:31] which part of the journey are we at are
[42:33] we still wise virgins carrying oil in L
[42:36] here or have we come
[42:39] into the secret
[42:42] chamber of the Shina glory and caught up
[42:45] into that realm where there's no other
[42:47] light but his light that's the light
[42:50] when we sing We Walk In The Light
[42:53] beautiful light walk where the D drops
[42:57] of mercies are bright why don't we need
[43:00] you say you may be saying now listen to
[43:02] what you may be saying but
[43:05] brother brother brandham says that the
[43:07] light in the lamp is the Holy
[43:11] Ghost you're saying we don't need that
[43:13] no I am saying the Holy Ghost has
[43:15] personified himself in
[43:17] US Christ won't open the door to us to
[43:21] someone who is imperfect who has not
[43:24] become the word so when he opens up the
[43:27] door to the bride you are the Holy Ghost
[43:29] made flesh
[43:32] amen it might sound strong language now
[43:35] but remember Redemption is to bring back
[43:37] that which was lost hallah yes yes
[43:41] praise the Lord am I've got another I
[43:43] want to close with this I've got some
[43:45] time I'm finished with my message just
[43:46] give the Lord a good an clap of
[43:48] Praise
[43:50] amen so I'm
[43:52] saying a multiplication of Grace God's
[43:55] number for Grace is five
[43:57] yes if it's going to be a multiplication
[43:59] of Grace over your life for God to
[44:01] remind you amen who you
[44:05] areall it's God's grace Upon Our Lives
[44:08] amen I've got some other notes I just
[44:10] want to throw this out here very quickly
[44:12] because in your study I want you to look
[44:14] at this
[44:16] amen I found some interesting things
[44:19] here and I thought I'll just share it
[44:21] with you for those of you are students
[44:23] of the word you want to share you want
[44:24] to go look into this this isn't a very
[44:26] nice thing amen you got the it's full
[44:29] history repeating itself praise the
[44:34] Lord this four
[44:44] there amen we'll try and get through
[44:46] this very quickly I want to be very
[44:48] careful with this carefully and see this
[44:51] God promised at the end time Malachi 4
[44:53] is going to be fulfilled has to be right
[44:58] right it's just before Christ comes the
[45:01] second time by the time Jesus come all
[45:03] scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile
[45:06] dispensation will be in its last Church
[45:08] age when the messenger of Malachi
[45:11] comes he will be right to the word take
[45:14] the whole Bible from Genesis Revelation
[45:16] start at serpent seed carry on to the
[45:18] message of the last latter rain this is
[45:20] where I want to get to he has to be for
[45:23] history is repeating itself from the
[45:26] time of a
[45:27] pay attention to his words now very
[45:29] particular from the time of
[45:32] a Israel history under a is happening
[45:36] right here where in South
[45:38] Africa in
[45:40] where when the prophet where the prophet
[45:43] of Malachi
[45:45] appears now I also want to place a
[45:47] timeline right there I'm showing you how
[45:49] to study the word he never had a message
[45:52] before
[45:53] 63 all the time he's saying I'm waiting
[45:55] for a message I'm waiting for a message
[45:57] I'm waiting for a
[45:58] message right so he only got the message
[46:01] in 63 that's when Malachi 4 now had a
[46:03] message to turn the heart of the
[46:05] children to the fathers can you say amen
[46:08] amen right that's the part I wanted to
[46:11] get to so what history are you talking
[46:13] about brother brandham that will repeat
[46:15] itself in
[46:16] America this is it as Israel Left To
[46:19] Worship in Freedom pushed out the
[46:21] natives raised up a nation with great
[46:24] leaders Etc this is it put an aab on the
[46:27] throne with Jezebel behind
[46:30] him right so we have done the very same
[46:34] in America aab was set in the
[46:36] presidential
[46:38] chair with a jezebel behind him to
[46:41] direct him it's such a time as this that
[46:44] the messenger of Malachi must
[46:46] come
[46:49] Hallelujah right then we want to get to
[46:52] this very quickly condemnation by
[46:53] representation brother gr is confirming
[46:56] woman given to the right to vote elected
[46:58] President Kennedy was the woman's vote
[47:01] wrong man which will finally lead to
[47:04] full control of the Catholic Church
[47:07] Catholic Church is the Jezebel
[47:09] behind a right pay
[47:12] attention then the bomb comes that
[47:15] explodes her hey that's going to happen
[47:18] now if a prophet
[47:20] speaks they done
[47:23] for right there are seven things
[47:25] predicted all five of them already
[47:27] happened we can say six is already
[47:29] happened now you can judge for yourself
[47:31] how far away we are we at the end if
[47:34] them five things happen these other two
[47:36] things are bound to happen it's got to
[47:38] happen right now this is where I want to
[47:40] get to because remember he says from the
[47:42] time of a history will repeat itself so
[47:46] in timeline of Prophecy when when did he
[47:49] say a will appear when the prophet of
[47:51] Malachi 4 comes so who was president in
[47:54] 1963 Kennedy am so we are saying Kennedy
[47:59] was the 35th
[48:01] President so we are counting from there
[48:04] I'm not going to say anything else but
[48:05] show you the fact you can study it he
[48:08] says I do not think that Mr Kennedy will
[48:11] have much effect
[48:13] now he'll make a wonderful pres
[48:16] president in order to bring in
[48:22] the to get a scen just like they have in
[48:25] England like they got in Mexico what
[48:27] scene Catholic
[48:30] Church like they did everywhere else and
[48:32] American people so unstable not
[48:34] spiritually they're smart but not too
[48:36] smart for their own good intelligence
[48:38] swings backwards sometimes backfires
[48:42] right then I got this church here to
[48:44] show you the
[48:46] Kings amen from a now these are all the
[48:50] [Music]
[48:53] kings right and it ended and
[48:58] O after o There's No More Kings right
[49:02] I'm bringing this for a purpose you go
[49:04] scroll down there and you'll see there
[49:07] amen go back to the notes thing he all
[49:10] scrambled praise the
[49:15] Lord so if we are counting there we you
[49:19] delete Dr not amen just show show that
[49:22] Word document

[49:45] the
[49:46] 44th Pia was trumped as the 45th
[49:49] president Pekka was Biden as the 46th
[49:52] and it ends with this guy OA who was the
[49:55] 47th
[49:59] after that after King OA Israel went
[50:02] into
[50:05] captivity now I'm not saying the prophet
[50:07] is saying history is repeating itself
[50:10] from the time of air this is just
[50:12] something for you to go and study and
[50:14] look at and see that there was no king
