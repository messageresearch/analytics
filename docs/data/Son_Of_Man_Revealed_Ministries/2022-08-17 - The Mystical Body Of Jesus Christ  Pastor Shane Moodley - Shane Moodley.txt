father as we turn the service over to you that you may have the oversight of bringing your word in such effort oh God that your spirit may give life life eternal for those to receive it in Jesus Christ then we pray and as his message and All Shall say Amen praise the Lord you may be seated amen I'll bring you greetings from the Spoken Word Fellowship in Stanger and I want to tell you that I really appreciate the church out here and you know when you look at the banner in which the word is being weighed up and it just gives us Grace to understand the hour that we are living in amen you know what a wonderful message they are uniting time that was ministered out here and uh it was great it was good it was an understandable but the greatest thing is that we need to understand and know the hour in which we are living amen and to prepare ourselves to get into the Rapture yes so uh we're going to uh turn to the word of the Lord in the book of Ephesians chapter 2 and I want to speak to you tonight on the mystical body amen praise the Lord Ephesians chapter 2 5 and 6. you love the Lord amen amen praise the Lord amen Ephesians 2 5 and 6. this is what it says even when we were dead in sins even yeah now Paul is ministering to the Ephesians and is bringing out a remarkable statement not only a statement to the Ephesians but a statement that will be approved in the ages to come so that we will be able to enhance and understand the depths of the word through a prophetic Ministry amen yes right and he says even when we were dead incense had quickened us together with Christ so we were quickened together with Christ amen uniting time bringing us together Amen to generous with the Fate that was once delivered unto the Saints is being made manifest in the hearts of men women and children that are called The Bride of Jesus Christ on this side of Eternity amen praise the Lord then the word then the Lord said by Grace you are saved amen Mystics and at raised us out together right and had to raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his precious word amen and that raise us up together together you know togetherness we need something sometimes we cannot take much for example much with one another but the great effort of the Holy Spirit has brought us so that we will learn by spiritual application of the word to live a better life to live a life that is totally worthy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen to understand the spiritual mathematics that has come forth in the end time Hallelujah [Music] now the Bible I mean uh the prophet brings out a message the world is falling apart preached on the 15th of November 1963. I will just bring it to appease our hunger this evening we are resurrected in the kingdom of God Amen we already resurrected in the kingdom of God Amen the kingdom of God is the word made Power in you and in me come on now amen hallelujah the kingdom of God is a word made Power in you and in me amen the kingdom of God is within you amen why all these man-made systems Must Fall amen not once more outside the world but I'll shake Heavens yes it says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away amen the word now is embedded in the hearts of the Bride yes to be established in the unity and in the fight towards the mystical body of understanding that we are one in Christ amen come on Church yes praise the Lord hallelujah okay and those things that cannot be shookly says is what will remain there's only one thing will remain the word amen and we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot be shook or moved that that's the kingdom of God hallelujah amen I love that amen and a message token he says here every promise in the Bible is yours yes amen it belongs to you amen when this token is upon you and God has sealed you now we want to check ourselves just for a moment amen when God has given you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you amen you see how important it is to receive the Holy Ghost yes amen the promise is given unto you and to your children even as many as the Lord thy God shall come amen praise the Lord amen when God give me the true baptism of the Holy Ghost then the light of Jesus Christ is within you now that's true amen and every Theologian will have to admit that yes we got no room for theologians yes amen we are moved by the influence and the characteristic of the Holy Spirit within us in the time frame of Grace to utilize the god-given gift to work out our salvation with fear and internally yes amen hallelujah Amen to me it's the new birth yeah amen we need the new bird the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personality now if we have not the new birth then something is drastically wrong in the manner in which we have been placed in so we need a repentance yes we need something to say a lot nevertheless not Marvel but let your will be done I need a new background I want to make Heaven Lord I want to drive to Heaven Lord yes what shall I do amen with Jesus which is called the Christ and everything that Jesus purchased and promised you in the Bible is yours yes it's your property because it's faithful amen Life Is Mine he paid for it yes life is yours he paid for it healing is mine he paid for it amen healing is yours he paid for it Freedom Is Mine amen he paid for it yes Heaven Is Mine amen he paid for it he has paid the price amen hallelujah everything he purchased belongs to the man that holds the token amen amen he says pass my token upon the streetcar on the day of the judgment wonderful streetcar you remember brother Brandon says in the message entitled the token and then it goes there he says that inspector has to inspect the vehicle make sure everything is tied right yes sits right the bones and this and that is all corrected for it to go into a journey amen so therefore we are also tried and tested in order for us to have the token yes amen we need to display it with the sincerity in in our hearts to understand and know that the Bible principle of receiving the Holy Ghost will be the very nature of Jesus Christ amen amen Hallelujah praise be to God hallelujah right amen he displays himself through you amen hallelujah amen hallelujah yes when you recognize the token the life that it took for the blood to speak there's no other ways that you could get to it amen beside the message of the hours there was a prophetic Ministry and the United Ministry had to come and now everybody says well now okay because the son of man revealed Ministries out here we got the spoken with Ministries in Stanger Durban and surrounding areas they have fellowship and different areas now you're with me yes amen I won't miss out on party Elizabeth also we have the same Spoken Word Fellowship or whatever but the reason why I bring this to you and our subject matter is the mystical body we need to hear what the spirit of God is saying amen it will take a five four minutes amen under the inspiration and revelation of the word of God to inspire your faith that is deep within you Amen to mobilize the effort to a characteristic power of Christ vested in your life and in my life amen too [Music] okay communion we are all watch this we are all by one Spirit baptized into one body amen you know the reason why I said you there are diversities of churches what are they believing today are they believing that which brother Branham has brought in the revealed word for the hour or are they going into a different road map of understanding I think it is so I think it is that I think it is that it is presuming presuming if you venture without Authority yes yes you and brother Branham went and got a clear-cut decision when he went into the woods to get his sermons and whatsoever when God inspired him he came with the same inspiration and divided the word of God into the hearts of men women and children amen so that they will be able to enhance and realize that God is speaking amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen the Bible tells us for as the body is one and at many members we are many members yes PE has members the whole world has amendments right but it will have the same amen yes what was in those standards t24 no one knows but we need to know it will take a profit yeah and the prophet is a Divine revealer of the word of God Amen so the interpretation validated by the scripture and answers a characteristic down payment for the Bride of Jesus Christ to walk in the Highway of Holiness where the footsteps of the righteous is added up the Lord thank you for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body so what I have you have yes what you have they will have amen they won't be they won't be a difference of opinion to which the scripture amen amen and mystery requires a scripture yes yes a scripture requires a revelation and a revelation requires the manifestation of the scripture in your life and in my life amen come on say Amen okay we want to find out now what is mystica it's having a spiritual meaning or reality that is neither apparent to the senses nor obvious to the intelligence this message is not the intelligence of man yes this message is the intelligence of God Amen let them put Let the mind that was in Christ now in now be in you yes amen it will take the mind of the word of God your mind in spiritual uh and spiritual awareness to which the scripture for you to have amen undivided attention towards his stewardship at all times amen I say this at all times we cannot play with this message amen Brothers if we are hung in the mystical body wherever you are in your homes Durban tongue not staying there yeah then we collectively yes have amen our thoughts must be his thoughts yes amen our word must be his word amen our spirit must be visible can you see where we come from amen amen we don't come from here we come from eternity amen so we come from eternity there is a power bank there is some point of remembrance that we have that is given once we are here on Earth amen so that we could not fall into the uh divided opinions of uh uh of men that's why Paul said I did not come into like Excellency of man's Wisdom but I came under the power and demonstration of the holy spirit amen so the holy spirit gives a divine intervention and a Divine uh revelation of the word to tell you although we may be so and so so and so but we have the power of Christ rested in US amen yeah but by one spirit we are all baptized into one body and the body is a family amen the family of God and that's the house of God and the hearts of God is the name of Jesus Christ the name of the Lord is a magic Tower the righteous run into it I have chose to put my name at the door of the House of My Worship come on our church amen hallelujah Hallelujah for my family will be gathered in the under it says will be gathered in the under the blood like it was in Egypt anything outside [Music] and in there there's there's no leaven bread can you see where we come from yeah can you see what we need to do in our lives yes we need to say Lord help us help me Lord yes Lord I have my weaknesses I have my problems I have my desk I have my dad but your Prophet has said Lord he says and indeed he says here and in there there's no lemon bread yes help me Lord not to partake of the living bread help me Lord to be in the communion and the spiritual awareness Awakening of the word of God give to me an understanding that I may pursue the spirit of almighty God to live a life that is totally worthy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord amen [Music] right and he says in my house my children born of my genes amen glory to God my genes are in them yes the washing of the word Water by the word of God to release amen that washes and cleanse you into an effort of understanding that you may work out amen that which the prophet has given you immeasurable spiritual awareness to be that son and a daughter of God yes foreign amen he says yeah I put my word in them I will write them upon the tables of their heart I will give you a new heart amen you have a new art you've been born again amen you live by the spirit yes you walk by the spirit you do everything by the spirit amen if there's anything really it's going to be revealed to you it's going to be revered by the spirit confirmed by the word it manifests for the results in best yes amen appraisals he says that's my family the family of the body of Jesus Christ the family we are that family amen this is my family yes amen the family in standards together our family this family in PE is our family amen the family in the entire universe of the message of the hour is our family according for them to to understand the revelation of the revealed word in the faithful Ministry of the word of God so that they will grow according to the gifts operating in the church amen yes say amen amen amen the church is universal the message of the hour but spiritual baptism into the mystical Body of Christ same with the faithful Ministry must have the same revelation if it does not compare with the scriptures it's a wrong yes amen you love him amen amen I love him brother amen you know the former pastor of this church pastor Ronnie ganger we were very very studious it gets to be up sometime one two three o'clock in the morning we have in Fellowship fellowship with the word of God he wants to share I want to share he's a good body of mine he's still a good body of mine amen but we went the extra mile why because as pastors of the church we have a responsibility amen responsibility to the congregants responsibility to the word responsibility of what we have to say Amen to the congruence that will grow in spiritual in spiritual growth and coding as the nutrients of the word amen develops into the spiritual life yes okay let him under pressure there is a refuge he says a towel a rock in a weary land a priest in really land now you look at everything about you that's going on in this world you look at the government you look at the things just the other day you can see Israel although it's a chosen country the floods and all those kind of things that's happening there God has only interested in the 144 000. in Revelation 11 Moses and Elijah right but we had a job to do yes amen we need to go into the reptile just don't stand it do something to work it out amen amen read your Bible yes yes pray the dominantes ask for Revelation no matter what God will see you through amen nothing can harm me now there's a prophet says living under pressure nothing can harm me now I am protected by the blood of Jesus Christ yes amen we the bride of Jesus Christ we are protected yes by the blood of Jesus [Music] a company of angels around the beach the angels of God and the comfort about those they don't believe they don't leave they stay there day and night but you are not aware the other way I encountered about those who fear Him and you have a refuge you can come into it and every privilege and what a time it is to be in this refuge and have fellowship with him okay amen when Master do you have fellowship with the Lord come on when last should you talk amen no I mean look let me say he says in that day I'll be in you yes you and me I am the father the father in me I'm not quite correct yes so when you want to talk to your blood Shout you're talking listed on the table and you just talked to you amen just drop this in you know Jesus you know uh you know I I love my fellowship with you I I appreciate you I thank you amen you predestinated Me by election adoption you brought me this whatso I I'm approaching you yes I am my common uh failures and faults and whatever yes but I need you to strengthen me so that I will be able to be a better person because I'm not a half fellowship with you I don't want to have fellowship with anybody else amen I want to have fellowship with you um 28th of July right 1965. why do you hung the church why do you thirst you let all these things to get you know upon you you let your jaw you let your wife you let this that and the other get in between you when you know way down in here you are hungry and testing oh God amen amen I want to tell you since God loves you amen God appreciates you amen hallelujah there we are back to the end time you know we never realized what you see at the day of Pentecost they were already all together did something happen yes amen we need to be all together in the unity and in the faith amen and I want to tell you something the third pool hour is here amen it will be manifested if we come into the togetherness and into the faith amen believing is word for the third per hour to be exercised in your life and in my life there we are back to the end time and I spoke against that denominational system right then let me tell you this on the bottom of my heart to you we got no time to play with denomination we got no time for all that you see some people say no you know what I want to leave this church and I want to go to that church I want to go here and I want to go to no Revelation yes the same holy spirit that is here is the same holy spirit that is found in the mystical body amen you cannot teach the Holy Spirit what to do yes you need to be obedient full obedience to the word of God will give you the token the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost itself will lead you and guide you yes so what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the indwelling presence of Christ's power in the spirit to enhance your realization as brother Brandon says in that day when partial realization becomes fully completed realism amen hallelujah Hallelujah it says and I so believe tonight that it is accessible Cesspool that it's a place where the fall run into it that's what's happening today now what is a cesspool a a disgusting or corrupt police we got no time to go to a coral place yes we got no time to go and visit here and visit there no no no no no no no pray for leadership you know like I preached on streets I preach on a call down individual under divine leadership a called out individual and the Divine leadership and God calls us man yeah God sent you Elijah God said I have chosen you you have not chosen me I have chosen you so if I have chosen you I have a responsibility according to the message to give you Revelation to give you understanding to give you all these things so that you will be able to be a child a son and a daughter of God Amen that rapturing Faith could be instilled in the hearts of men women and children praise the Lord hallelujah he says here now I can't believe that God would ever take such a thing in his church he speaks about another cleanliness you know all this other kind of thought and whatever it is because it's got to be born of the spirit of God and then cleansed before it can be called his amen can you say amen amen amen so what we have done even baptized when you see the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost comes makes a way for you and me teaches us how to live how to hack how to understand how to love your enemies how to you know love them they respectfully use you all these kind of things why because it's love it takes perfect Divine love to get there and we need to work it how are we going to work it by the word of God Amen praise the Lord just get down on Earth and pray I know it's difficult but there is some place yes that you could do something that he can do something for you the mystical Body of Christ we are baptized into it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost without that you cannot make it can you say amen amen amen the Holy Ghost is important friends very very important you've got to be born again of the spirit of God or you'll never be able to come on Fellowship grounds with our God Almighty himself um come on for it only upon the basis of the shaped blood that he received any believer amen we have been received say amen amen amen [Music] how can you believe when nothing there to believe our mind that's what's happening with the churches of the message of the hour today I'm not propagated I'm not trying to say this debt on the other but there is a church yes that is called out [Music] in spiritual baptism under the influence of the Holy Ghost amen will have Divine interpretation of the word amen and she will lay in the presence of almighty God to be righteous amen Commando Church Hallelujah it says now he says here as I said mental mental consumption we did not come we did not come by Me by a concept that we think it is no we didn't come we did not come by the rebirth we've come because we were seed yes yes only the election can have that revelation and grow in the power and strength of Jesus Christ amen now because this is what he says he said just a caramel mine through mental conception you can't do it that's a reason people don't believe in Divine uh in Divine Healing because they never walked into that blood stream to The Fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ okay you've got an intellectual Faith oh you believe the word and you mix it and make it suit your theology but once you come into the kingdom of God to the blood of the Lord Jesus meeting upon the shed blood brought through the testimony the public testimony of the Clemson blood of the Lord you are in here in Fellowship where God can't bless you amen yes and you can shout and praise the Lord and the powers of God working why in God himself his own body the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ here on Earth operating upon the basis of the shed blood oh heavens amen thank you Jesus thank you Jesus see what I mean not upon the braces of the Methodist Baptist a Pentecostal church or any other church not upon the basis of water baptism although it's good it's all right but not upon the basis of water baptism look upon the basis of draining a church joining a church is good but it's upon the braces of the shed blood amen you make a fellowship with the church the congregation but you will never have fellowship with God till you come on his basis his terms amen his term is through the blood yes and through the blood you become a part of him into the same cell that he came out of the same cell that came and went into virgin birth Mary the blood of God and I as I said as the bright and bright room is one that same cell that was in Jesus is the same cell that is in you right and the Very present and part of God comes into you so you came here not because just you want to become yes yes he made it possible amen that you could be here you hear his word not my will but his word when he speaks through the bottle lips of clay where the Branham said it's deity speaking amen amen and you are seated in Christ Jesus in Heavenly places amen what is that a believer's position in Christ amen hallelujah amen by faith you purchase it and that same holy spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ comes into you amen and then you are Sons and Daughters of God abducted by the Lord Jesus Christ into the body of Christ do you see where you are friends tonight amen he's such a wonderful God that he showed you every way according to the scriptures and how he took a prophetic Ministry to bring light into our hearts that we will be able through that light understand the verbatim of the word of God that has been entrusted to us in the end time [Music] said that Jesus who has the same yesterday today and forever watch him in his power the same Lord Jesus the same love the same wonders the same signs that follow him moving right on down is in the mystical body now where he is hey he's in the mystical body now amen the body of the resurrected ones from sin into life amen it's no longer I get limit but Christ that liveth in me we don't sin anymore we are living a life that is worthy of the gospel God has separated us from a life of sin to eternal life by the word of God to be substantiated on the minutes of divine fellowship with him the person of Jesus Christ in the mystical body amen he is in the mystical body now the body of the resurrected ones from sin into life he lives in them God in his great Glory God condescending coming from the pillar of Fire no man could touch down into a form of human flesh where he could touch but he was born of Burden then out there giving his life to be crucified to cleanse sinful men and he could live right among men what love that God has for men yes that he unfolded himself down to make a clean place that he could live and love among men and women it's beautiful it's beautiful that's our father Yes amen hallelujah thank you Jesus in three kind of believe this is what he says he says forgive us Lord forgive us Lord of our sins help us oh God especially your church them that baptized into that mystery Body of Christ which is the spirit that quickened you said as a son of man ascended up so shall his body Ascend up and he is the head his church is the body of God it's the head that guides the body let the headship of the word guide the body and let me be a part of it amen I loved it amen they call out individual in Divine leadership praise the Lord are you happy amen amen hallelujah all the cold is gone all the cold is gone amen everything is gone Amen in this divine presence full Joy amen we are just enjoying laying in his presence yet the Church of the Living God so that he could speak to us the Divine uh word of God that will establish Us in the faith that we may work out and go into another higher dimension in the power of Grace um now don't get the Rapture of the church and the white Throne judgment mixed up because the Rapture of the church there is no judgment there's no judgment Revelation 10 came down 101 came down the Earthly Angel was on Earth at the time of his coming judgment is over everything is over you got no judgment you're cleansed by the blood amen amen you're woven into the uh I should say the sting of the blood of the Common Thread which is the blood of Jesus Christ a fabric that you are using Amen to clothe you to have a better understanding that God and Murphy is with you yes Hallelujah I love him you love him amen so the mystical he says but the mystical is not the denominations don't have anything to do with the denominations [Music] you're a church that's why we don't treat Church we need to be serious if I want to worship God I need to be serious amen yes if I want my family to be saved I need to do things right yes my wife wants to do things like my husband needs to do things but my children need to do things like everybody needs to do things right then all will be all right yeah they're down on your knees and pray you know when we were young and the children were going to school what a privilege it was to to get them done under in the lounge and then get down on our knees read the Bible and pray and seek God's intervention for our lives as they grow they go to school they go to universities they go here they go there and they connect themselves in different things suno related the lukewarmness comes in so we need to throw the word of the word to read Kindle the want of the fires of God to be removed to remove those things that easily beset them to be a living testimony for Jesus Christ Hallelujah the mystical body of Jesus Christ by one Spirit right we are all immersed into his one body then the token is on the door for you are in Christ and he was the one your sacrifice who stood the judgment and when God looks upon that he can't do anything amen applied the token he can't do a thing you are just as safe as you can be because God and Christ is the self same person the spirit being made flesh dwell Among Us and there is god with his own with his own self and you his own children into the body there you are not a chemical or a spirit I will pass amen amen who wonderful Jesus amen praise the Lord okay God is wonderful amen God is powerful yes I pray that God will give you the elimination of his spirit down from yourself to behold and understand this very message which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost to take you into the dimensional power of Grace to learn and
