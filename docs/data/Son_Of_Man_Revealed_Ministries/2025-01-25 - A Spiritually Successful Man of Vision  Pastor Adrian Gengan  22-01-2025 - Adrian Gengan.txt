bring an Awakening to us oh God and I pray Lord we live to our purpose oh God for which you have called us we ask his Blessings Now in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ much Thanksgiving amen amen I VI you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's certainly good to be found in the house of the Lord amen so we can come and worship Him amen let's turn to the book of Hebrews praise the Lord Caleb if that you can go a bit lower if not you can switch it off amen amen we'll we'll read from amen I'll read the first verse then I want to drop Amen to verse 5 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen faith is the EV faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen verse 5 says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death amen and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God Amen but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that comes come to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen I want to read one more portion there from verse 8 about Abraham by faith Abraham amen why I'm reading this both Enoch and Abraham we know had a change of body by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have receive for an inheritance obeyed and went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob he hirs with him of the same promise for he looked for his city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God Amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word amen praise the Lord amen if if I want to title this tonight I want to speak on a spiritually successful man of vision amen [Music] amen I titled it that way specifically because normally when I talk about success people just want to focus on the natural amen so I'm speaking on a spiritually successful man of vision amen hallelujah and just uh to highlight something in the scripture there regarding Abraham the Lord had told him I'm going to take you to a phys physical land but something transpired in this land in this man's life amen even though he was living in the land you can see the Bible is saying he focused his attention away from the natural land and he was just living in tents amen and he was looking for a city whose Builder and maker is God so he got his eyes off the carnal Natural Things hallelujah amen and he focused on the Heavenly but he was super abundantly blessed in the natural land amen amen amen so a man if he wants to access the keys of success needs to know that he needs to access the keys to the kingdom and seek the kingdom first am amen now when we are saying a spiritually successful man this man must have access to untapped resources resources that are not easily accessible to just anyone else amen others could have tried to copy what Abraham was doing you know when somebody sees you investing in something they want to invest the same way amen somebody sees you buy a property they probably think okay I should buy a property as well so even if they tried to copy the pattern of Abraham they wouldn't have succeeded because he had a covenant am amen amen he had a covenant with him amen hallelujah so we see as well as the Bride of Jesus Christ with the seven seal open up to us a new land we have access Amen to Supernatural untapped resources amen and I say that we need to tap more into it amen amen hallelujah and and the access to these unta resources like we say are not accessible to anyone and you have to work by spiritual laws of the kingdom of God to be able to access these Supernatural resources amen if we are you know in the natural you have to work with natural laws to attain natural results so when we are coming into spiritual laws you got to work by these spiritual laws amen praise the Lord now many times it'll seem mysterious to everyone around you how is Abraham successful yeah amen what is his key you know in this day and age through the social media and YouTube and all of these accesses through Instagram everybody wants to tell you that you need to sign up with them and they will unlock the secrets of everything how to do things now you would know Does Elon Musk share his Secrets does Bill Gate share secrets so these guys are lying because man is naturally selfish if he is making millions and billions it's not in his natural thing for him to share that information absolutely so what they trying to get you on he sign up onto my cause I will teach you how to do this so they are making money of you amen so to access these things like we saying you got to walk with spiritual laws and it will be mysterious to those that are around us who are not caught up and living in this realm of divine exess remember this realm of divine exess is only open to the bride am amen amen when brother brandom is saying that the Rapture is a revelation only for the bride he's telling you that only she can access this dimension amen yes Lord amen to everyone else it'll be foreign language they won't be able to digest what they hearing and amen and convert it into rapturing faith when they hear it amen hallelujah they they are seeing it still as a mysterious word they can't understand it amen so there are certain Realms and certain excesses that are reserved for a son only when the sun comes into the position of adopted son there are certain Realms and excesses in the kingdom of God that are Reserve when amen for your spiritual maturity amen amen you can't access his Realms amen if we are immature we got to be fully adopted sons in order to qualify to access these hidden Realms amen hallelujah amen amen maybe we'll just uh start out with the prophet and and get some background into what he's saying here he says science has taken man forward more forward greater things with his mind right he talks about the tree of knowledge and he's saying they have taken him greater in the mind farther than ministers have taken him with the spirit which is unlimited yes amen now I want to say that that was 1954 yes and he's talking about the denominational world but we had a prophet amen we had a Watchman amen that was here amen hallelujah and we have the fivefold ministry which is being led by the spirit and is taking the bride into Dimensions which is unlimited amen hallelujah he says but here is what it is SS ain't looking back to what science said a few years ago science is taking what they got now moving forward for something else I say we take the opening of the word and move into something else amen all the promises that have been locked up there for the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen now is not the time for us to access Realms of how the angel came to the prophet in the cave how you walked in the first pool Ministry how you walked in the second pool Ministry how you walked in the third pool Ministry if we are still trying to unravel those things something is wrong that was not left for us to analyze am that was the prophet's Ministry and I want to declare that he successfully completed all three polls amen the third pool would get a rainbow trout a people of God Amen which we are called out by the message of the hour amen praise the Lord amen so we are not looking for things to come to pass they have already transpired the bride is called out sealed with the Holy Ghost amen the bridegroom has come for the marriage now praise the Lord amen amen so yeah the prophet again now I just want to amen elaborate on this sence 150 years ago made a statement that if a man ever went the terrific speed of 30 m hour that's pretty slow gravitation would take him off the Earth cuz he was riding in an ox cart do you think science looks back to that today no sir they're going, 1600 M an hour in a jet plane and still going moving further yes we're up to a place where we can believe now he's taking the spiritual application now we are up to a place where we can believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost we can believe in the healing of the sick and he says let's move on to the resurrection of the dead and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen now if that wasn't Within in the capabilities of Sons and Daughters of God brother Brandon won't be telling us let's move on into that yes hallelujah amen as sence can only go so far then it falls back we got unpacked he wants to say untapped we got unpacked Resources by a Divine promise from none other than the Son of God saying whatsoever you ask the father in my name I'll do it am amen hallelujah I want you to really understand what Jesus is saying there when you as a Son of God asked something he said I will do it amen hallelujah he says I feel religious now to think of that all things are possible to them that believe amen he says God I've got enough faith for the sick now God give me enough faith for something else amen amen hallelujah don't ever settle amen there are more dimensions of the Holy Ghost that are able to be opened up to us if we can allowing it and we have the expectation for more amen amen we should never settle and say oh we've reached this level now yes for example my faith is at a level that if our lay hands upon the sick they are recovering he says that shouldn't be our goal he says look for something else amen look for the dead to be raised move into higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord so in other words be more spiritually have a more spiritual vision amen a higher Vision yes amen God is not limited amen by accomplishing certain things God has a complete vision of the complete Plan of Redemption amen and according to God's Vision it's not complete yet yes when God sees it he sees it as already complete but it's still in the process of time but I have good news for you it's almost at the end for the Gentile dispensation God has got a people on the Earth right now who are becoming the word amen amen we know in John 1 we talked in 114 the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us now flesh is becoming the word amen so what changed when we read about Abraham there what change what experience did he have that would change his Focus from off the Earthly and look for a Heavenly City it was the meeting of MDC MDC shifted his entire Focus why MDC was Priest and King MDC was the image of God amen amen Hallelujah so when Abraham is looking at this man he's saying this is the Genesis 12 126 man I was made in this image am amen I was made in this likeness and this is what I am after Abraham knew amen that he was old in body and he knew when the Lord is telling him that your children and your children's children will be prosperous he knew he wasn't going to live forever he was going to go down to the Grave praise the Lord amen amen so the world can celebrate their things but we need to celebrate our things in the kingdom of God Amen you see right now what's happening in the USA they are celebrating their Superman that's right amen but the man is 78 79 years old he himself knows on the outside he can maybe have some energy but in the inside he's going to must up that strength but I want to also draw the parallel and tell you that's a man of vision he's got a goal in mind a purpose in mind amen what he wants to achieve and even though he got defeated amen the second time you know there in 2020 was it he got defeated the man never gave up on his vision amen hallelujah yes the law allowed him to be the president one more time and you would know amen I'm not here to preach politics or I'm not condoning it amen I'm just telling you the amount of persecution he faced the court cases he fac the man was perseverance now are we going to back down every time we come against some sickness some illness some opposition some discouragement oh I don't want to go to church I don't want to do this I don't want to do that are we going to be like a person without a backbone or we going to be persevering for the kingdom of God do we have a goal in mind amen have we caught the mind of Christ concerning our lives yes amen praise the Lord he says but man keeps we go to the next one there right he says but man keeps progressing keeps getting more wiser your grandfather went to see your grandmother in an ox cart your daddy went to see mother drive a horse and buggy I went to see my wife in Immortal tea my boy got an eight cyinder Speedway whatever what you call it probably the children will have a Jet Plane so what is showing you the progress of Science and as brother Bram is detailing it they once took a ox and they attached a car to it what was that somebody had a vision to travel differently it was a vision in a man deep was calling out to deep for more and as the age increases God puts the desire in man for something more yes amen amen man man makes declarations you would heard they made a declaration they want to now oist the flag in M they'll never do it but I'm saying they have a vision amen like they wanted to raise up a tower to B Amen to the heavens yes they they never did it but they had a vision of doing it and it even even got the attention of God that said look how United they are yes amen if they are so United in one speech one Accord man will be able to achieve much more so I'll go down and confuse their language amen so he says that's the way we keep progressing so somebody had a vision hey this hor is too slow for me let me get a horse horse is faster amen then somebody said no why have one horse so they went how many power ores it they took the power of so many OES and they somebody God gave somebody a vision of an engine the mechanics of it yes somebody amen so God anointed people for each age because he needed them to progress yes yeah Hallelujah praise the Lord so what were they doing God was allowing them as time was progressing access to his laboratory praise the Lord amen he says that's the way we keep progressing why why do we keep progressing like that he says because we have a soul amen hallelujah amen we have a soul yes now we read about all of these men that were great engineers and all of these things we don't know if they were selected of God and will be there on the other side we don't know praise the Lord amen he so because we have a soul a bird doesn't have a soul and he goes on to say Amen that a bird is still making this the way did in the Garden of Eden yes they didn't progress yes amen amen hallelujah but we have the bir doesn't have a soul but we have a soul we're not a Creator but we can pervert now we can't create Timber but we can take Timber after God has created and make a house out of it amen because we offsprings of God Sons and Daughters of God no matter how we've Fallen still we have to recognize that we are Sons and Daughters of God in our fallen estate we're still sons and daughters God made a promise God has to keep that promise amen hallelujah now science no matter how advanced they get even now they made an announcement amen we we heard about artificial intelligence now they talking about super artificial intelligence it's gone super now they're talking about that amen praise the Lord but even AI requires is the resources of the Creator no matter how advanced they get they still need resources from God almighty praise the Lord yes amen they were talking about the advancement of signs and what they are going to do with super artificial intelligence they say within 48 Hours your blood test will be done and like if you had cancer the inoculation the vaccine whatever you need to directly attack the cancer will be produced specifically for your body according to your genetics within 48 Hours what are they trying to do I only know other one other thing that can work instantly like that is Mark 16 the prayer of faith shall save the sick amen hallelujah so they trying to catch up and and and amen at Advance at a rate amen that they're trying to me the match the power of God because that's not natural praise the Lord normally you go for blood test you got to wait couple of days am then they've got to administer whatever medication they have but they're saying now it'll be so Advanced that amen that uh artificial intelligence will be able to analyze your blood and the cancer that's in your blood and the vaccine will be able to specifically attack that cancer cells amen so what am i showing you man has a vision for more yes they are not saying okay we have now chemotherapy and we have other radiation treatments we sort it they're always wanting to achieve more why man knows that his capabilities are Limitless amen amen so can't we as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen realize that our capabilities are Limitless and we are to match the capabilities of the Lord Jesus Christ yes Lord amen that just what I just said there Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me Amen Hallelujah Jesus said Greater Works than these shall he do for I go unto my father amen but where is the where is the dividing now that we can't match what Jesus did what is stopping the flow of unte resources in our lives amen how are we going to become spiritually successful men of vision and and access this realm of untapped resources Hallelujah there's only one way amen and if you put up St John 5:19 there Jesus is giving us the key praise the Lord and unfortunately the keys are not what people like so we don't have screens up we got it this way amen Jesus said to them verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth that also doeth the son likewise amen yes so it's a complete submission yes Amen to the will of the father amen a complete surrender to the Holy Ghost yes because then it's no longer us doing it yes amen but it's Christ in me the hope of glory amen so as we are planning now it's gone the third week about the third week now I think in January by this time most dreams most Visions most plans start to fizzle down the same enthusiasm you had on the 1 of January starts to fizzle down amen but you got to have be a man of vision a man of purpose amen amen to keep the dream alive to keep the vision alive to keep the goal alive amen I don't know if it was Columbus or somebody amen these early Travelers when they were traveling they told them that at a certain point if you're traveling on the ocean you're going to fall off the Earth but that didn't stop them yes do you know if that was true they would have Di died but you think it stopped him so he said even at the cost of my life there something in my soul telling me that there is a land amen something was driving him to go west amen something was driving him Amen to go and and and find a country that they had never seen before amen and it should be so with us with Abraham something was driving him he knew there's a land where did mes come from that's the land I want yes amen amen amen the the prophet was telling us I'll just uh illustrate the story he says you can find it there in Believers believe from the heart 57623 paragraph 48 he says in Australia they wanted to build this bridge but the place that they needed to build the bridge had sinking sand and they brought the best Engineers from around the world Amen he says they brought the best Engineers from around the world and all of them said it's impossible for us to erect a bridge in this spot until he said one man spoke up and he said I'll be able to build it now he was a man of vision the prophet says it there finally there was a man who was a man of vision a bridge builder in England he came over looked at the sand surveyed it tested the soils sounded the water looked over all over first he says oh I love it he looked it all over Jesus said a man buying a ground amen first sits down count the cost am amen I want to get to the point amen so the man tested the soils amen and in each bed there was quick sell finally he went to the officials he said I will build a bridge and it will be safe Hallelujah now consider how are we speaking over our situations yes when we are encountering a trial a sickness a circumstance are we going to the word examining it testing it finding the scriptures the promise to know how to activate the keys to be spiritually successful coming back and saying this thing will be well amen I'll overcome this where is our resource I tell you nothing shall be impossible to us am Hallelujah yes Amen in the realm of Finance in the realm of healing Amen in the in the realm of the Holy Ghost yes in the realm of uh children in the realm of marriage in the realm of school in the realm of college nothing shall be impossible amen [Music] Hallelujah the bridge Builders of America and different parts of the world laughed about it the man is mentally heal no one can put a bridge across that even if a chicken should walk the bridge amen it would sink the bridge can't stand the vibrations of a dog you see how people will come against your vision but who analyzed it who did the testing yes who went into the word amen amen hallelujah amen amen who followed the prophet praise the Lord You Have To Be An Eagle to be able to follow the prophet so who did the hard work but now people are going to say no it can't be you mean you all are the only ones saved you're all the only ones going in the Rapture what about all these people what about all these churches he says even if a dog runs across the bridge of vibrations amen which shake the Sands and the bridge would go down it can't be done but this man was a man of vision yes I say this to you in both your spiritual life and natural life never let anyone speak against your vision amen amen God gave you that Vision yes God placed it in your heart amen amen amen hallelujah UAH but this man was a man of vision and he knew what he was talking about for something down in there told him he could do it yes now what he says God give us men in the church like that I say amen amen hallelujah amen oh no we can't do this we can't do certain things how about we try it and let God determine whether we can do it or not amen amen you always I get the msers yes praise the Lord on why we can't do things you notice sometimes when we want to go ahead and do something you always getting someone why we can't do it that way yes well then what's the solution amen praise the Lord now from all the scientific research it could not be done science proved that it could not be done but this man had a vision he could do it so he took the contract now he was a very smart man you see quickly went to work testing the soil sounds the depths of the quicks sand bear tested every bolt every piece of wood every piece of metal every concrete everything had to be perfectly tested because his great name and his character and his ability rested on whether the bridge stood or not and if a man of this Earth by a vision would show that that everything was tested perfectly before he put it to the bridge because of his character because of his name how much more did our blessed Heavenly Father test every word that was ever said or wrote in the Bible amen he tested every word every Prophet the material that goes into the Great Highway every Rock every material before it's placed in the body of Christ has to be tried chasen amen no exceptions everyone had to be tested by the holy spirit so he says I've he forget his name so he got the best mechanics best concrete man he could find amen so I want to get to the part what he did you're probably wondering how did he build it on quick sand amen we going to go past this amen so what he did was he started to dig away all the quick sand amen go down further he he started to dig all the quick sand see the prophet is now bringing it spiritually he started to take away days of Miracles his pasted all the unbelief all the quick sand and he went down down down for hundreds of feet beneath the water even until he blow that shifting Sands out of the way amen he put this concrete anchored in the Rock on the bottom of the sea amen and anything that worth having has a price attached to it how great the Salvation what a great price you know I was telling a brother I forget who it was and you know when you say you're going to do this do that they're going to first most people just say oh but this is in the way I said I don't care what's in the way of the building if it's if the price is good enough see that if it's worth having brother Brandon is saying it has a price attached to it yes amen it might cost a bit more but it can be done yes amen hallelujah amen and my my other statement to him is that we are not not going to do something because of the cost amen because if we attach your value to it then we are telling God is incapable of meeting the need amen we are telling God you are limited in your resources praise the Lord yes but then again that's a vision for the church amen amen it's a vision where we can all get together with one mind one Accord amen hallelujah praise the Lord so he got rid of all the shifting sand until he reached Solid Ground and from there he began to pour the concrete amen so I'm saying let us get rid of all the shifting SS of doubt the shifting Sands of unbelief do you know that a man of vision has to be highly motivated yes amen amen a man of vision is not an ordinary man amen nothing can distract him from his goal from his vision from his purpose so that's why no matter how they try to distract Jesus from his goal and his purpose yes for being the Lamb of God for giving his life life on the cross nothing could separate him from his purpose praise the lord the devil even tried to offer him stuff yes amen praise the Lord so let's get rid of all doubt all reasoning all fear insecurities you know insecurity is a bad thing that oh maybe this is not my portion in life no the Lord says that if you put your hand to work God will bless it yes God put man in the garden and he said work yes Hallelujah do you know we still have access to the ground but we are so lazy we want to go to the shop amen God still blesses if you plant yes yes whatsoever you s there scripture whatever you s you will reap we only want to apply that monetary wise to Blessings but God still has given us access to the ground because that was man's primary purpose when he was put in the body of Flesh till the ground God has got to honor that law amen amen for I got shocking news for some of the younger people here that Apple that orange and all that fruit and veg that you see in the store didn't just appear there if you ask someone where CES come from they'll tell you from Checkers or from Pick and Pay whichever store amen but there's a farmer behind it there's somebody who's tilling the ground yes we we seeing all our fancy devices and all our our gold and all of these things somebody is working the ground amen so God has amen still these accesses to us like we saying Columbus he was told to fall off the Earth he was a man of vision Edison now this is very powerful Edison tapped into a resource that belongs to God Amen it was actually was the guy before amen uh I got it here somewhere the prophet is speaking about it Benjamin Franklin praise the Lord now you would know that electricity even now they can't Define what it is people think they know what it is they know it's a it's a force that's there yes they've learned over the years now how to harest it and how to bring it down to usable appliances they've learned how to take that current amen we don't use that raw current amen that current is stream I don't know the right word but it's streamlined reduced you put resistance okayy to reduce the current I don't know they bring the current down to be able to handle the wattage on the speaker amen if you probably connect this thing straight to that power lines the thing is going to blow up yes amen praise the Lord why I'm saying that he tapped into what he tapped into was a resource from God at one time man didn't have electricity on the earth man didn't have light but God allowed them to access his laboratory for a reason amen amen so here the prophet now I'm just going to go through it we're going to close now amen he says the holy spirit is overseen that through the age that all God's word is inspired and in time the old Wheels gr slow but it show it gr sure so things may go slow but the wheels are moving it's got to be just the way God said it was going to be no matter how unreal it seems it's going to be that way one time they didn't have electricity but some men believed there was such a thing he kept walking tiess hours until he discovered what it was and the same thing by television by automobile and so forth God put these things here for our benefit amen hallelujah God is putting these things here for whose benefit our benefit now if we were acquainted with the supernatural oh there he's talking to me somebody say he's talking to me if we were acquainted with the supernatural just take a man where the man in his senses is limited to his senses but a man in his spirit is unlimited so don't try to do things in the flesh he says a man and his spirit is unlimited the tree of knowledge can only climb so far and breaks back but the Tree of Life goes on Amen and now the science has taken man farther with his five senses than we have with his soul but now look at look at the key to it read past that what came to access our soul the Holy Ghost with what the the word of the message of the hour so I'm saying there's only one prophetic class of people that have accesses to the realm of the soul that can access his untapped resources yes amen I pray somebody's getting it tonight so there's only a certain class of people that can access these things and if you want the type of it it's Enoch Enoch was tasked to write the second Bible but there's no blueprints for it we don't have recorded documents for it but God tked him to write the second Bible in the pyramid what accesses did he have what realm did he tap into praise the lord well we've got untapped resources where all things are possible amen talk about split atoms and waves amen when Benjamin Franklin first found electricity he said I got it I got it but he didn't know what he had a long C Thomas Edison said it'll work for us and he didn't care how long it took he tried 10 thousand different wires but yet he found a wire that would finally carry the electronic or the electricity into the wire he know it was power and that power would work in our benefit and now we found salvation that will save us from sin take the violence man or woman drunk up prostitute make a child of God that same faith that same power will lift up a fallen man woman of that it'll work for us in many different ways it'll heal our bodies if you can just find the right approach you've got to find how to do it so there's no sickness no disease incurable what is brother Brandon saying you've got to find how to do it when when Jesus was coming back from the mountain there and his disciples couldn't cast a demon out from that boy was there a way to do it were the disciples asking Jesus how can we do it so they is a way to do it amen yes the question is are we willing to spend tireless hours yes get into the word build our faith till we believe the promise to get the desired result because brother Bram is saying here if we can have the right approach you've got to find how to do it yes so nobody should be able to say that I was born poor and I'll die poor because you can find a way to get out of your poverty [Music] Hall praise the Lord amen are we using the same principle the same law and let me tell you a lazy attitude a lazy mentality will never do you any good it's going to require determination it's going to require Focus yes praise the Lord last quote now can you imagine this building here being energized tonight for light by the electricity electricity is the Unseen Force when it's Earnest and brought on when Benjamin Franklin first screamed I've got it he didn't know what he had but Along come Edison and put it to work and today we can send a wireless telegram from right this place here to any around the world by a wireless telegram an unseen Force moves it through space that no one can catch it only Machinery can catch it because it's too fast for the eye but yet there's a force that telegram coming through now brother Brandon would have been you can send a WhatsApp to someone in America right now you can even call them you can even video call them technology has advanced praise the Lord if the natural laws of God which is electricity and things once handed in the right capacity can do those things I am saying the the open book The Open Word in the right hands in your hands amen praise the Lord how much more could the power of the Holy Ghost once passing through the human heart by faith what it could do yes now I'm going to close and tell you this that electricity is not an ordinary Force every name of God starts with what what does electricity start with amen they know it's not a natural force that's why they named it e praise the lord it's a resource of God that God allowed them to tap into that Laboratory amen praise the Lord amen even the fourth dimension we talk about the opening of spiritual doors yes is a door open to us that we can see this how is he projecting it what is controlling there you are able to see hallelujah it's a it's a resource open to us so I'm saying to be spiritual successful and a man of vision there are untapped resources that God has only allowed his specific class of people to get into to tap into am we can choose to be complacent about it we can choose to not go into it and we can continue living Our Lives as normal or we can say I will dedicate my time I don't care if it takes me countless hours I don't care if it cost me my sleep praise the Lord amen I'm looking for men of vision I'm looking for men of purpose who's not going to rely on their natural five senses of the flesh man to get them by in this life but are able to tap into spiritual resources and Realms of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord amen amen let's read one more quote paragraph 112 in perfect Faith praise the Lord [Music] I'm looking for somebody who's going to connect with this tonight that's not going to come here on Sunday and say I forgot what you preach Wednesday but a man moving with a vision with a purpose to say if there's untapped resources and Realms that have not been accessed and maybe it was accessed One Time by The Prophet but now the wells have been covered the caves have been covered to this Realms I'm going to uncover it amen here what the prophet of God says Jesus lived in a world that no one know it about I've been trying to express this the last couple of weeks now the shout is a realm that nobody knows about except the bride yes right it's a door open to us he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was am now he says if we live in a perfect faith of a Christian amen so you see that's an exis we can but he's saying if we yes so there's a choice there yes if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are we'd be a Mystic to the whole world the people won't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do see St John 5:19 You' walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do then people began to say you're a Mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they were Mystic people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves Jesus lived in a world that no one else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke they say this and then they said you talk in riddles we don't understand this how can you be there wasn't in the world that he lived in so they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he's isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there you're getting into bright material you're getting into rapturing condition that means for each one of us not just pastors deacons trustees means for the Ley every individual walks in the world with God Alone you're baptized into the kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God he gives the orders you pack them out whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you got right on just the same now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that nothing that cannot fail that faith never fails he was a Mystic with his perfect Faith so is it now with those who have perfect Faith are a Mystic to others amen I'm saying that we have been limiting ourselves to access Realms to access dimensions of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah number one it could be through ignorance if we don't know we have the ability to access his Realms amen amen we're too scared to walk in the Supernatural or we are too caught up with the carnal life that those things don't even concern us contacting the supernatural World praise the Lord hallelujah but what we are looking for and trying to inspire in us right now is to raise up that man amen amen that's got that deep call within him to say whatever you saying I see myself in that amen I'm able to live in those Realms I'm able to tap into those Dimensions praise the Lord yes and what I'm saying is because sometimes you can be so consumed so burdened by the normal circumstances and pressures of life I am saying by living in this world you can rise above those circumstances amen amen the flesh becomes nothing amen amen you speak to mountains they move you speak to winds and they obey yes so in order to access and be take control of the natural realm you first got to take control of the spiritual realm hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord I wish I was getting a better amen resp response from you this evening I wish that you were more excited about it than I'll tell you why maybe because amen let's Stand Together people know what's required to access his Well it can't be casual amen it's not part-time work it's not parttime work it's not when I get a chance yes that's right God study men who had success in the Natural Life who tapped into electricity who tapped into laws you'll see they dedicated the entire life to it that's right entire being they eat sleep and smell these things amen how determined are we to be all that was prophesied about us how determined are we to be a spiritually successful man of vision amen praise the Lord thank you hallelujah amen may the Lord open up our understanding amen amen all of us have a greater potential to serve in the Kingdom better yes Jesus amen the brother who feels right now that I can't be used in the Kingdom God has a greater purpose for you Hallelujah Lord what's your submission level yes Lord amen while the Holy Spirit is calling you respond and say holy spirit I Surrender I submit to the will of the father I surrender to the Holy Ghost how you want to use me use me father we can sing that amen my life
