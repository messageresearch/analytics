[10:06] also increase
[10:08] amen so should I walk with the Lord
[10:10] increase that's the only way we're going
[10:12] to overcome this world amen hallelujah
[10:14] amen this morning
[10:17] we'd like to speak on Amen on the wings
[10:19] of a mighty Angel upon two and this time
[10:22] we'll focus on the emancipator last week
[10:24] we spoke on the proclamation
[10:27] but he came with a proclamation which is
[10:29] the message of the hour
[10:31] and the message came to tell us that we
[10:33] should go free
[10:34] amen we should go free
[10:38] amen
[10:39] you know in the natural the citizens of
[10:42] the US have celebrated Thanksgiving
[10:45] amen they were celebrating their freedom
[10:49] amen when they were liberated
[10:52] and you know Abraham Lincoln is regarded
[10:55] as one of the Great emancipators of the
[10:58] Black Nation
[10:59] in the USA
[11:01] amen
[11:03] so if they can celebrate natural men
[11:06] a natural accomplishment look at how
[11:08] they celebrate Martin Luther King Jr and
[11:11] how they celebrate Nelson Mandela and
[11:12] all of these people that set man free
[11:15] from a natural bondage and a slavery
[11:18] are we focusing our attention on the
[11:20] greatest of all scriptures when the
[11:22] emancipator came down on the earth amen
[11:25] so we'll read from Revelation 10 there
[11:28] amen just to get context and then we'll
[11:30] go to Psalm 91.
[11:33] blessed be the name of the Lord
[11:39] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[11:41] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[11:44] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[11:46] were as it were the Sun and his feet as
[11:49] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[11:52] little book open and he set his right
[11:54] foot upon the sea and his left foot on
[11:56] the earth and cried with a loud voice as
[11:59] when a lion roared and when he cried
[12:02] seven Thunders uttered their voices
[12:04] and when the seven Thunders had after
[12:06] their voices I was about to write and I
[12:09] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[12:11] seal up those things which the seven
[12:13] Thunders uttered and write them not so
[12:17] notice the time the seventh ambros are
[12:18] seven Thunders are uttering their voices
[12:21] when the lion roars
[12:24] amen
[12:25] everyone reading the same Bible it says
[12:29] amen he cried with a loud voice and when
[12:32] he had cried
[12:34] so if you are if you are claiming to
[12:36] have heard the mighty angel
[12:41] the mighty Angel Raw when he descended
[12:45] then there should have been seven
[12:46] Thunders after their voices
[12:50] amen hallelujah
[12:52] amen some of you are scared to say Amen
[12:55] this morning amen because the devil has
[12:58] put scarecrows around the scripture
[13:00] don't be afraid of the scriptures for us
[13:03] amen it says when the seven pandas had
[13:06] added their voices amen I was about to
[13:08] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[13:10] saying unto me seal up those things
[13:12] which the seven dandas added and write
[13:15] them not amen so let's turn to Psalm 91
[13:19] will see the same God and what David is
[13:21] saying about him in psalm 91.
[13:31] shall abide under the shadow of the
[13:33] almighty amen amen amen his shadow is so
[13:37] powerful
[13:39] that we can find Refuge just in his
[13:42] shadow alone amen if there was a fight
[13:44] breaking out and there's a great
[13:46] sunlight and it's in the midst of the
[13:48] day and I tell you just standing by my
[13:50] shadow
[13:51] Hallelujah will you find any comfort in
[13:54] that but here he is telling you he will
[13:57] dwell it in a secret place of the most
[14:00] high
[14:01] oh Hallelujah who's dwelling in the
[14:04] secret place in this hour think of
[14:06] Psalms 27
[14:08] he hired me in his Pavilion psalms 27
[14:11] amen the Rapture message amen hallelujah
[14:15] so he was dwelling under that seventh
[14:17] seal of the most high shall abide under
[14:19] the shadow of the Almighty I will say of
[14:23] the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress
[14:25] my God in him will I trust amen surely
[14:30] he shall deliver thee now watch that's
[14:32] what is coming down in Revelation tear
[14:34] to bring Deliverance surely he shall
[14:36] deliver thee From The Snare of that to
[14:39] Beast the snail the foul Fowler and from
[14:43] the noise some pestilence he shall cover
[14:45] thee with his feathers
[14:47] amen protection with feathers amen and
[14:51] under his wings shalt thou trust his
[14:54] trust shall be thy shield and thy Butler
[14:57] Brother Branham says amen have you ever
[14:59] seen amen this great Eagle wings you can
[15:02] find Refuge under the shadow of these
[15:04] Eagle wings amen but I want you to know
[15:07] this Eagle he's also a mighty angel
[15:10] amen and we can find Refuge under the
[15:12] wings of this Great Mighty Angel amen
[15:15] this is not an angel without wings
[15:17] because when the prophet of God saw him
[15:19] he describes the angel and he says these
[15:21] great Wings Swift amen sit back
[15:25] Hallelujah he said he was flying amen
[15:27] amen this is an angel with wings in
[15:30] Revelation 10.
[15:32] amen he says Thou Art my shield my
[15:35] butler Thou shalt not be afraid for the
[15:38] terror by night nor for the arrow that
[15:40] flies by day nor for the pestilence that
[15:43] walketh in darkness nor for the
[15:45] destruction that wasted at Noonday A
[15:48] thousand shall fall at thy side and a
[15:50] thousand at their right hand but it
[15:52] shall not come nigh be can you say amen
[15:56] amen only with an eye shall not behold
[15:59] and see the reward of the wicked
[16:02] because that was made the Lord which is
[16:04] my refuge even the most high thy
[16:07] imitation
[16:09] amen hallelujah
[16:12] amen there shall no evil befall thee
[16:14] neither shall any plague come nigh thy
[16:17] dwelling for he shall give his angels
[16:19] charge over thee to keep thee in all thy
[16:22] ways they shall barely up in their hands
[16:25] lest thou Dash thy foot against a stone
[16:28] Thou shalt tread upon the lion and add
[16:31] up the Young Lion and the dragon shalt
[16:34] thou trample undefeat because he set his
[16:37] love upon me therefore will I deliver
[16:39] him I will set him on high because he
[16:42] had known my name amen he shall call
[16:45] upon me and I will answer him
[16:47] that's when he came to call the names
[16:49] that were found in the book
[16:51] and I will be with him in trouble I will
[16:53] deliver him and honor him and with long
[16:56] life will I satisfy him and show him my
[16:59] salvation amen may the Lord that
[17:02] blessings to the reading of his word you
[17:03] may be seated amen hallelujah
[17:14] amen so last week we looked at on the
[17:17] wings of him of the mighty Angel and we
[17:19] started to show you that he came down
[17:21] with the proclamation
[17:23] and we started to outline the scene and
[17:26] the setting of how it was a militant
[17:28] setting
[17:29] he's descending in a time of War
[17:32] it's uneasy upon the Earth everyone is
[17:35] trying to flex their muscle all powers
[17:37] are rising up two million demons 200
[17:40] million demons have been let loose upon
[17:42] the Earth amen it's after the second
[17:45] World War
[17:46] Hallelujah
[17:48] so notice there it's between the sixth
[17:51] trumpet and the Seven trumpet that
[17:53] Revelation 10 he said
[17:55] the six angel trumpet that sounded and
[17:58] then comes revelation 10.
[18:01] amen the same mystery lies between the
[18:04] sixth and the seventh seal
[18:07] between the sixth and the seventh seal
[18:09] comes the seventh chapter of Revelation
[18:11] dealing with the Jews
[18:14] now between the sixth and the seventh
[18:16] trumpet comes Revelation 10 dealing amen
[18:19] when the Redemption claims being brought
[18:21] back to The Descendants on the earth and
[18:24] then Revelation 11 is going back to the
[18:26] Jews
[18:27] amen
[18:29] so we started to show you how that this
[18:31] lion was this Angel was roaring like a
[18:33] lion
[18:35] and every time that he came we took the
[18:38] scriptures and we showed you every time
[18:40] he came when he came to Joseph to marry
[18:43] to all of them and he told them fear not
[18:46] amen but during Revelation 10 he doesn't
[18:48] tell them fear not because when he's
[18:50] roaring like a lion he wants to strike
[18:52] fear in their hearts
[18:54] he's come as a terrorist
[18:57] to terrorize them
[18:59] amen he's coming to claim his own yes
[19:03] amen and he's not casual about it
[19:06] there's any Rose like a lion
[19:08] he's come to take possession of his own
[19:11] amen hallelujah because when the
[19:14] deception came in Eden he didn't come
[19:17] there roaring like a lion and finish off
[19:19] the Beast
[19:20] the serpent in the Garden of Eden but
[19:22] this time that he's paid the price of
[19:25] redemption amen and the work of
[19:27] redemption has been accepted in
[19:29] Revelation 5 he's now coming down again
[19:31] amen with that open book and in that
[19:34] book has names now you'll only find that
[19:37] in the message of the hour amen if you
[19:40] read Revelation just alone Revelation
[19:42] chapter 5 you'll read Revelation chapter
[19:44] six nowhere does he tell you that the
[19:46] book has names
[19:48] right
[19:50] but there is one with a message designed
[19:53] to uncover The Mystery of the book
[19:57] you read Revelation 6 and every time he
[20:00] breaks the seal it only tells you and
[20:02] when he had broke the first seal the
[20:04] second seal he heard a boy saying come
[20:06] and see and then he talks about a rider
[20:08] four Riders right
[20:11] amen
[20:13] and then you know the fifth seal
[20:15] the souls Under The Altar and then the
[20:17] Sixth Seal the Great Tribulation and
[20:19] then the seventh seal there's silence in
[20:21] heaven but he doesn't tell you anything
[20:23] about what is written there
[20:26] right but here comes a prophet
[20:30] the one who the Bible speaks about in
[20:33] Revelation 10 7 that when he shall begin
[20:36] to sound the mystery of God should be
[20:38] finished
[20:40] and we know we've been well taught that
[20:42] we are part of the mystery of God
[20:43] because Eve is a part of the mystery of
[20:45] Adam
[20:48] so if he is revealing the mystery of God
[20:50] he's got to reveal all of the mystery of
[20:52] God that's why when he's taking Christ
[20:55] is the mystery of God revealed he starts
[20:58] out with Christ fully being revealed
[21:00] through Jesus Christ and now he's having
[21:02] the preeminence through a many-membered
[21:04] body amen we become part of the hidden
[21:07] Mystery that was locked up in Jesus amen
[21:13] amen amen
[21:14] and then he's going to restore the
[21:16] kingdom as the third part of that work
[21:19] so people try to make lions cute
[21:22] you know when you see a lion
[21:24] in fact if you want to know who was
[21:26] Adam's pit must have been a lion
[21:29] you know the prophet describes that
[21:31] scene and how the lion walks with him
[21:32] and he calls him shita amen and he tells
[21:35] him amen and they're walking in the cool
[21:36] of the day but I want you to know
[21:38] there's nothing cute about a lion
[21:41] if you'll ever come face to face with a
[21:43] lion there's nothing cute about it you
[21:45] can't go to the line here kitty kitty
[21:47] here kitty kitty let me stroke your main
[21:52] amen if you're standing in front of a
[21:55] ferocious lion
[21:57] fear is going to strike your heart amen
[22:01] in fact when that line Rose there's a
[22:04] reason why lines Roar
[22:06] the first reason is to communicate their
[22:09] location
[22:11] and when he was you want to tell us he's
[22:13] on earth now
[22:15] amen amen yes
[22:18] amen hallelujah I'm taking the national
[22:21] and typing the spiritual of Revelation
[22:23] 10. and that's when lion was to
[22:25] communicate his location amen
[22:28] amen
[22:30] when you are praying right now don't
[22:32] think that you are your prayers are
[22:34] sending up to somewhere far in heaven
[22:35] God is in the midst of his people
[22:38] amen he has come down in the midst of
[22:41] this battle the greatest battle ever
[22:43] fought he's come down in the midst of
[22:45] his people amen amen think of the
[22:48] captain of the horse when he went to
[22:49] Joshua that day he came down in the
[22:51] midst of the people
[22:54] a lion roars to communicate their
[22:56] location he wants to show his strength
[22:59] you know when he when he's trying to
[23:00] show the rest of the the other male
[23:03] lions he starts to Roar
[23:06] it's a show of strength
[23:08] and he wants to intimidate all the lions
[23:11] from the other Pride
[23:14] amen because on the earth in Revelation
[23:17] 9 there is one that he is warring like a
[23:19] lion
[23:21] seeking who made me devour
[23:24] yes amen he's using special voice
[23:27] effects
[23:30] is really a mouse but he's using a line
[23:33] filter
[23:34] [Music]
[23:35] I'm talking about the devil yes
[23:38] I'm talking about Satan yes amen
[23:41] hallelujah sometimes you hear a faint
[23:43] whisper because you really got your foot
[23:46] on his head
[23:48] other times he rose like a lion when you
[23:50] take your foot off his head
[23:53] amen
[23:55] but they say that a a simple Lion's role
[23:59] can paralyze
[24:00] the person the prey
[24:03] it paralyzes fear that's why they
[24:06] they freeze
[24:08] or he can strike Terror in the heart of
[24:10] a human
[24:12] now the role of a lion this is 114
[24:15] decibels
[24:17] if you know what that is sound is
[24:19] measured in decibels
[24:21] is 30 decibels
[24:24] a normal conversation is about 60
[24:27] decibels
[24:28] a motorcycle engine running is about 95
[24:31] decibels
[24:32] noise above 70 decibels over a prolonged
[24:36] period of time may start to cause damage
[24:38] to your hearing
[24:43] amen
[24:44] so above 70 decibels can start to damage
[24:48] your hearing
[24:49] so think of double that 114
[24:54] it's now under than
[24:57] 14 decibels that a lion can roar
[25:01] so a loud noise about 114 can cause
[25:05] immediate arm to the ears
[25:09] can you imagine now that these years is
[25:10] ringing when this line roared
[25:14] who was he roaring through who was
[25:16] echoing that wrong
[25:18] the prophet
[25:22] you are now the demons started to
[25:24] tremble
[25:25] you heard how the demons want you to
[25:27] shut him up because it was damaging the
[25:30] hearing
[25:32] amen any lines Roar can be heard
[25:36] five miles away if you don't know what
[25:39] five miles is that's just over eight
[25:41] kilometers away
[25:44] I don't even think it's eight kilometers
[25:46] from here to Gateway Mall
[25:51] so think of how loud this voice that it
[25:54] can go past that eight kilometers
[25:58] that's how loud the road is
[26:02] and when this line came to Raw in
[26:05] Revelation 10.
[26:06] amen his voice was heard all around the
[26:09] world
[26:11] amen
[26:12] Every Nation tribe and time begins to
[26:14] hear the Roar of this Mighty Angel and
[26:17] they couldn't understand it but they
[26:18] said isn't this just a man with seven
[26:20] Great education
[26:22] they didn't understand that Luke 17 amen
[26:25] was in effect
[26:27] that it was a son of man revealing the
[26:29] son of man
[26:32] and his raw struck fear in their hearts
[26:35] that they wanted to silence him yeah
[26:38] now Isaiah 63 and verse 9 just to show
[26:41] you who this Angel really is amen Isaiah
[26:44] 63 and verse 9 talks about the angel of
[26:48] his presence
[26:50] amen
[26:52] it says in all the Affliction he was
[26:54] afflicted and the angel of his presence
[26:57] saved them
[26:59] amen the angel of the presence if you go
[27:02] and do a study about it it's referring
[27:04] to God
[27:06] amen
[27:07] it's not a regular or a created angel
[27:12] um
[27:13] amen I wanted to spell that notion this
[27:16] morning that the Revelation 10 Angel is
[27:19] a created angel
[27:22] the angel that came to the prophet in
[27:24] the cave is not a created angel right
[27:29] because God has bodies
[27:32] he's got an Angelic body
[27:34] he's got a fear from your body
[27:37] amen he's got a flesh body
[27:40] Hallelujah
[27:41] well right now there's no flesh body
[27:43] because it's now a glorified body
[27:46] but two thousand years ago he came in a
[27:48] flesh body
[27:49] [Music]
[27:51] now it's a glorified flesh body one that
[27:55] cannot die
[27:56] let him come this time and they try to
[27:58] take him and crucify him
[28:01] can't do it
[28:03] amen because he raised up to triumphant
[28:05] so the angel of his presence is
[28:08] referring to God not in regular or
[28:10] created angel
[28:12] we find you in Genesis 22 and verse 12
[28:15] if we'll pick up that scripture Genesis
[28:17] 22 and verse 12. amen
[28:21] here Abraham is sacrificing
[28:24] and he's willing to sacrifice sacrifice
[28:26] Isaac and you know what he says
[28:30] let's just go up and we get context
[28:33] and the angel of the Lord so same Angel
[28:35] we're talking about now Angel of the
[28:37] Lord called unto him from Heaven saying
[28:39] Abraham Abraham and he said here am I
[28:44] and he said lay not thine hand upon the
[28:46] lad neither do anything unto him for now
[28:48] I know that thou fear is God seeing thou
[28:51] is not what El thy son thy only son from
[28:54] who
[28:56] but who's speaking
[28:59] the angel of the Lord
[29:01] he's saying you have not withheld your
[29:03] only son from me
[29:05] amen
[29:07] amen hallelujah
[29:10] Exodus 3 and verse 14.
[29:13] you know what Exodus 3 is
[29:15] Moses seeing this great burning bush
[29:22] let's go up one
[29:25] okay I need to go further just to show
[29:27] you that it is the angel
[29:29] okay let's start here okay go to the
[29:32] next first we'll pick it up in X it says
[29:34] that Moses said unto God
[29:36] who am I that I should go on to Pharaoh
[29:38] that I should bring forth the children
[29:40] of Israel out of Egypt and he said
[29:42] certainly I will be with thee and this
[29:44] shall be thy token that I have sent thee
[29:46] when thou has brought forth the people
[29:48] out of Egypt You Shall Serve God upon
[29:50] this mountain
[29:51] and Moses said unto God behold when I
[29:53] come to the children of Israel and say
[29:55] unto them the god of your fathers that
[29:57] send me unto you and they say to me what
[30:01] is his name what shall I say unto them
[30:04] and God said unto Moses I am that I am
[30:08] and he said thus shalt thou say unto the
[30:11] children of Israel I am had sent me unto
[30:15] you
[30:16] amen now let's go to Acts chapter 7 to
[30:19] get some clarity here about who's really
[30:21] speaking to
[30:24] Moses
[30:29] amen
[30:32] acts 7 30.
[30:35] it says here and when 40 years were
[30:38] expired they appeared to him in the
[30:40] wilderness of Mount Sinai an angel of
[30:43] the Lord in the in a flame of fire in a
[30:45] bush
[30:46] [Music]
[30:49] so it wasn't really just a bush burning
[30:52] but it was the angel of the Lord in a
[30:54] bush
[30:54] in an amber colored light
[30:57] the same one that is over the prophet
[30:59] amen the same one amen that led the
[31:02] children of Israel by night
[31:05] amen hmm
[31:08] so how come the angel is saying I am
[31:10] that I am
[31:12] when they asked you your name
[31:16] yes the Apostle Paul now speaking and he
[31:18] says the angel of the Lord in a flame of
[31:21] fire in a bush when Moses saw it he
[31:23] wandered at the sight and he drew near
[31:25] to behold it the voice of the Lord came
[31:28] unto him saying I am the god of thy
[31:30] fathers the god of Abraham the god of
[31:32] Isaac and the god of Jacob
[31:35] verse 35 this Moses whom they refused
[31:38] saying who made thee ruler and a judge
[31:40] the same that God sent to be ruler and
[31:43] he delivered by the hand of who amen
[31:47] by the hand of the Angel which appeared
[31:50] to him in the bush
[31:53] amen amen
[31:56] Hallelujah
[32:00] amen let's turn to Acts chapter 8 and
[32:03] verse 26. we're speaking this morning on
[32:05] the emancipator
[32:07] amen the proclamation of emancipation
[32:10] last week which only amen the mighty
[32:13] Angel has come down with a proclamation
[32:16] he come to set us free from every
[32:18] tradition amen every denomination
[32:22] amen every man made tradition an idea
[32:25] and here here's the angel and what am I
[32:28] trying to show you right now the
[32:30] characteristic of this angel
[32:33] didn't he come now we just wait he came
[32:35] to set Isaac free
[32:37] yes he was bound on the altar but he
[32:41] came to set Isaac 3.
[32:44] amen
[32:46] the same one
[32:48] went you to the bush so they can get
[32:50] Moses attention to do what to set the
[32:53] children of Israel free amen this Angel
[32:57] of the Lord is an emancipator
[32:59] amen
[33:02] he has an Egyptian eunuch
[33:04] trapped by Traditions or maybe the
[33:06] Ethiopian culture and traditions but he
[33:09] had gone to Israel that day
[33:12] and he's looking at the scriptures and
[33:14] the Bible says he was serving in the
[33:16] temple
[33:17] and yeah he's reading the scriptures on
[33:19] his way back and he can't make head or
[33:21] tales of the scripture he doesn't know
[33:23] who the Bible who as I is speaking about
[33:26] in the Bible
[33:27] amen and he's pondering these things but
[33:30] I want you to know in the city of
[33:31] Samaria there was a great Revival taking
[33:33] place
[33:34] the apostles were doing a mighty work
[33:37] amen they were preaching the gospel
[33:39] sending the captives free
[33:41] amen people were being healed there was
[33:45] a great Revival set out in that City
[33:47] and here the angel of the Lord calls to
[33:49] Philip
[33:52] and he tells him in 826 and the angel of
[33:55] the Lord speak unto Philip saying arise
[33:58] and go toward the self and to the way
[34:00] that go down from Jerusalem and to Gaza
[34:03] which is Desert

[34:08] he wants to set this Ethiopian eunuch
[34:11] free
[34:12] amen amen he's bound up in his thinking
[34:15] his theological ideas are all messed up
[34:18] he doesn't have the answer but the angel
[34:21] of the Lord is sending the messenger to
[34:23] go to him amen amen hallelujah I hope
[34:27] you're learning amen the angel of the
[34:28] Lord might use you
[34:30] to set one of his loyal subjects free
[34:33] the angel of the Lord might use you to
[34:36] call one of the names that is found in
[34:38] the book that is why he says go and
[34:41] prophesy again amen amen yes
[34:45] amen then you know the rest of the story
[34:48] how Philip goes there and he's
[34:50] translated in the moment in the
[34:51] twinkling of an eye

[42:45] was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot
[42:48] the flame of the fire slew those men who

[44:38] kingdoms

[45:29] so they came out of the midst amen
[45:33] let's go
[45:35] now here's the second declaration a
[45:37] second declaration is different from his
[45:39] first his first one was one of
[45:41] condemnation his first one was to bind
[45:43] people to worship the second one is now

[47:20] trying to establish Revelation 10 this
[47:23] Mighty angel that descended and the
[47:25] power you possess when you now take the
[47:27] book
[47:28] [Music]
[47:30] amen I think we come now oh yeah
[47:32] promotion Waits For You
[47:34] after the devil can't deal with you
[47:37] that's right
[47:39] the king promoted him man
[47:41] amen you're uncircumcised philistine
[47:44] let's know what to do with you say I'd
[47:46] rather just promote you
[47:48] yes out of the way
[47:50] amen
[47:52] somebody received that in Jesus name
[47:55] amen many many men
[47:59] amen
[48:01] Hallelujah
[48:03] blessed be the name of the Lord you'll
[48:05] find the same thing I'm not going to go
[48:06] through it now
[48:08] Genesis sorry Daniel chapter six exact
[48:12] same pattern two degrees go out
[48:15] the king makes a first decree
[48:17] If any man is found worshiping be thrown
[48:20] into the Den of Lions
[48:22] Daniel doesn't submit to that
[48:24] somebody emancipates Daniel from that
[48:29] Den of Lions who was it
[48:32] we already went through the types and
[48:34] patterns if I go and take every detail
[48:36] amen yes somebody delivered Daniel
[48:40] and after he's delivered the king makes
[48:42] his second decree I just showed you and
[48:45] I labeled this type if I do it it'll be
[48:46] like repetition but it's the same
[48:48] pattern it's the same Angel same as
[48:51] conditions exist amen amen and it's also
[48:55] why I took the three Hebrew boys because
[48:56] we are typing the three blue boys who
[48:58] stay true to Daniel's message amen
[49:01] [Music]
[49:04] so the potential is typing the prophet
[49:08] and we are typing the three Hebrew boys
[49:11] amen now I need to show you that the
[49:13] this Angel also has another
[49:14] characteristic
[49:16] and he's the strength Giver
[49:19] it's the same one we read in psalm 91.
[49:23] let's read Daniel chapter 10.
[49:32] it says here verse 18.
[49:35] how God strengthens us this Mighty
[49:38] Angels bring strength to us
[49:42] it says here then they came again
[49:48] and touched me one like the appearance
[49:51] of a man and he straightened me
[49:55] and said oh man greatly beloved fear not
[50:00] you should know who that is now
[50:03] amen last week we told you to recognize
[50:06] his language
[50:08] fear not peace be unto your deed be
[50:12] strong
[50:13] be strong
[50:15] and when he had spoken unto me I was
[50:18] strengthened
[50:19] and he said let my Lord speak for thou
[50:22] has sweetened me
[50:25] amen
[50:29] let's go to amen
[50:31] First Kings
[50:37] amen
[50:40] here's the time now Elijah is running
[50:42] from Jezebel you know he had slain the
[50:45] 400 Prophets
[50:46] and yeah in verse 3 he tells you and
[50:49] Elijah was afraid and ran for his life
[50:53] and when he came to basiba in Judah he
[50:56] left his servant there while he himself
[50:58] traveled on a Day's Journey to the
[51:01] Wilderness he sat down under a broom
[51:03] tree and prayed there that he might die
[51:05] he said I've had enough Lord take my
[51:07] life I know better than my father's then
[51:10] he sat you know he's sitting under this
[51:12] juniper tree and suddenly an angel
[51:14] touched him and said get up and eat
[51:18] amen the same Angel told you take the
[51:21] book and eat
[51:23] okay
[51:28] and he looked around and thereby his
[51:29] head was a cake of bread baked over odd
[51:32] coals and a jar of water
[51:35] the angel knows how to cook the angel
[51:38] knows how to paint
[51:42] and so we ate and drank and laid down
[51:44] again
[51:46] and his second time
[51:50] notice now
[51:51] a second time the angel of the Lord
[51:53] returned and touched him saying get up
[51:56] and eat
[51:57] or the journey would be too much for
[51:59] thee
[52:00] so he got up and ate and drank and
[52:03] strengthened by the food
[52:06] he walked 40 days and 40 nights until he
[52:09] reached horror at the Mountain of God
[52:12] amen
[52:15] oh bless the name of the Lord the food
[52:18] that this Angel gives to you amen he
[52:21] says you will be hungry no more the
[52:23] waters that I give to you you shall
[52:25] thirst no more
[52:27] he gave him sustenance that lasted him
[52:30] 40 days mmm why is that significant why
[52:34] am I highlighting 40 days there was
[52:37] another man
[52:38] he was no ordinary man and he was also
[52:41] in the dead of 40 days
[52:44] and after 40 days the amen Satan came to
[52:47] church him
[52:51] trying to show you the characteristic of
[52:53] this angel that is the strength Giver he
[52:56] is the emancipator but he also comes to
[52:58] give us strength
[53:02] John 12 28 let's pick it up and see this
[53:07] God man
[53:12] amen
[53:22] sorry I'm going first two ways
[53:23] glorifying his name now only I want you
[53:25] to hear this now
[53:28] John 12 now is caught up in
[53:30] glorification Father glorify thy name
[53:33] they came a voice from Heaven saying I
[53:35] both glorified it and will glorify it
[53:37] again
[53:39] do you watch always the second time
[53:43] we told you the angel touched him the
[53:44] second time Daniel the angel came to
[53:47] Elijah and fed him the second time
[53:51] now
[53:52] it's saying I glorified your name but I
[53:55] will glorify it again
[53:57] the people therefore now who is speaking
[53:59] to him
[54:01] the people therefore that stood by heard
[54:03] it said he thundered
[54:06] [Music]
[54:08] other said an angel spoke to him
[54:13] amen Hallelujah
[54:15] if you go there and you read amen the
[54:18] same one he's going now in the
[54:20] wilderness
[54:22] and he strengthens Jesus in the
[54:24] wilderness amen
[54:27] Hallelujah
[54:31] let's go to Acts chapter five I need to
[54:34] move on Amen
[54:36] I believe you got the point there
[54:38] amen this Angel strengthens us
[54:41] this Angel sets us free
[54:44] amen the angel of the Lord is on earth
[54:48] now fixing things
[54:54] now we find amen we're coming to New
[54:56] Testament now we went through the Old
[54:57] Testament showing you the angel of the
[54:59] Lord his characteristics and how we set
[55:00] them free we're now in the New Testament
[55:02] New Testament Church Apostle the
[55:05] apostles are on the Move amen here the
[55:08] high priest rose up verse 17 chapter 5
[55:11] verse 17.
[55:13] and all they that were with him
[55:15] which is the sixth of the Sadducees and
[55:18] were filled with indignation and laid
[55:20] hands on the apostles and put them in
[55:23] the common prison
[55:27] now we get into the angel of the Lord
[55:31] breaks down every prison door
[55:35] amen amen
[55:38] verse 19 it says
[55:40] the angel of the Lord by night
[55:43] opened the prison doors
[55:45] amen
[55:47] amen
[55:50] amen yes
[55:52] amen now what's the contrast
[55:56] if the enemy has you bound
[55:58] you will open up your prison door and
[56:00] set you free
[56:02] but here's the contrast
[56:04] there are other doors in your heart
[56:07] that he will not break down
[56:12] because you have locked it up
[56:14] and the prophet says the same God is a
[56:16] gentleman and unless you open up that
[56:19] door and invite him in yeah doors in a
[56:23] door
[56:25] so if the enemy has your shackle believe
[56:28] me he strikes me into the heart and he
[56:30] comes down and sets you free
[56:32] but don't you lock the door to your
[56:34] heart to him amen
[56:38] amen the angel of the Lord by Night open
[56:41] the prison doors and brought them forth
[56:43] and said go and stand and speak in the
[56:45] temple to the people all the words of
[56:48] this life
[56:49] what is he telling them go and prophesy
[56:51] again don't stop the prophecy don't let
[56:54] them put you in prison but thou must
[56:56] prophesy again
[56:58] and when they heard that they entered
[57:01] into the temple early in the morning and
[57:03] thought
[57:07] no we're not allowed to uh
[57:09] [Music]
[57:11] Thursdays are gone
[57:13] I think the police will come
[57:17] thou must prophesy again
[57:23] where did they go in a public place
[57:27] in a public setting amen
[57:30] yeah they're gonna call them now they
[57:32] went early in the morning now the I
[57:34] priest comes out and they that were with
[57:36] him and call the council together and
[57:38] the Senate now they're thinking that
[57:39] things continue the same they come back
[57:42] from a good night's sleep they know that
[57:44] the apostles are locked up in prison
[57:46] they come now with their fancy clothes
[57:48] and they're gathering for a great
[57:49] counsel
[57:50] VES and they're going to discuss this
[57:51] Apostles and what we are we're going to
[57:53] deal with him
[57:56] now the Senate of the children of Israel
[57:58] see they had Senators there too and sent
[58:00] them to the prison to have them brought
[58:03] come on
[58:04] [Music]
[58:07] yes you know when Satan lets you in your
[58:10] rut in your condition
[58:11] and he comes back to find you you see
[58:14] Satan is not all-knowing
[58:16] he can't be in all places at one time
[58:20] so when he makes you stumble he has to
[58:23] go somewhere else he thinks he's still
[58:25] got you in that condition
[58:27] but when they come to find you
[58:30] they see you're not there
[58:33] but when the officers came and found
[58:35] them not in the prison
[58:37] they returned and told saying the prison
[58:39] truly found we shut with all safety
[58:43] this was mission impossible oh yes the
[58:47] gates are even shut
[58:48] doesn't look like there was they called
[58:50] brother Joshua
[58:52] that's your fingerprints
[58:54] you can't find any fingerprints
[58:59] brother Joshua doesn't that's
[59:01] fingerprints anymore
[59:03] amen but the Joshua is in a senior
[59:05] position here call his men to go and
[59:07] dance here
[59:08] amen but you get my point
[59:11] they call the private investigators
[59:14] who opened up these prison doors
[59:17] the report went back it doesn't seem
[59:19] like the locks were tampered with
[59:21] this must have been an inside job
[59:24] somebody must have had the key
[59:30] it says we found this we shut
[59:32] without safety and the keeper standing
[59:34] without before the doors
[59:38] yes amen
[59:45] but when we had opened we found no man
[59:47] with him
[59:49] and when the high priest and the captain
[59:51] of the temple and the chief priests
[59:52] heard these things they doubted of them
[59:54] where unto this would grow
[59:57] then came one and told them behold the
[59:59] men whom you put in prison are standing
[1:00:02] in the temple teaching the people amen
[1:00:08] amen let's go to Acts chapter 12.
[1:00:12] amen
[1:00:14] once I was bound
[1:00:16] now I am free amen free
[1:00:20] I'm free Free
[1:00:23] amen now here's Aaron when Edward would
[1:00:26] have brought him forth now he put
[1:00:28] remember he put Peter in prison now the
[1:00:31] same night Peter was sleeping Between
[1:00:32] Two Soldiers
[1:00:35] they said this time you will secure the
[1:00:37] prison
[1:00:38] last time we put the soldiers outside
[1:00:40] the prison and we don't know how they
[1:00:42] escaped this time he's going to sleep
[1:00:45] between two prisoners Two Soldiers
[1:00:49] bound to two chains
[1:00:52] and the keepers before the door kept the
[1:00:54] prison
[1:00:55] and behold
[1:00:57] somebody descends
[1:00:59] the angel of the Lord came upon him
[1:01:02] and the light shined in the prison and
[1:01:05] smoked Pizza on the side
[1:01:07] and raised him up saying I Rise up
[1:01:10] quickly and his chains fell off from his
[1:01:13] hands amen
[1:01:15] why are you sleeping in the prison
[1:01:18] arise
[1:01:20] and the angel of the Lord said unto him
[1:01:22] God thyself and bind on thy sandals
[1:01:26] and so we did
[1:01:29] I want you to see there
[1:01:31] he knew he was in an uncomfortable
[1:01:33] situation so he tried to make himself to
[1:01:36] make himself comfortable within the
[1:01:37] prison
[1:01:40] why would someone take off your shoes
[1:01:44] why would you take off your sandals he
[1:01:46] too even took off his clothes some of
[1:01:48] his clothes
[1:01:49] he said you know what I'm in here for
[1:01:51] the long while I might as well make
[1:01:52] myself comfortable
[1:01:56] don't get comfortable
[1:01:58] amen don't rest
[1:02:00] emancipated is here
[1:02:04] he's telling me put your clothes back on
[1:02:07] it's amazing this Angel always tells you
[1:02:09] to clothe yourself
[1:02:12] the other one tells you take your
[1:02:13] clothes off
[1:02:16] and he went out and followed him
[1:02:19] wish not that it was true which was done
[1:02:21] by the angel but thought he saw a vision
[1:02:24] even he
[1:02:26] even he thinks this is now a vision one
[1:02:29] is walking
[1:02:33] when they went past the first
[1:02:36] the second war they came unto the Iron
[1:02:38] Gate that leaded unto the city
[1:02:42] which opened to them of its own accord
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:02:47] sliding Gates
[1:02:52] and they went out and passed on through
[1:02:54] the street forward the angel departed
[1:02:57] from him and when Peter was come to
[1:02:59] himself he said now I know of a surety
[1:03:02] that the Lord had sent his Angel and had
[1:03:04] delivered me out of the hand of Aaron
[1:03:06] and from all the expectation of the
[1:03:08] people of the Jews
[1:03:12] amen
[1:03:14] Hallelujah
[1:03:18] this Angel of the Lord wants to deliver
[1:03:20] his people
[1:03:22] he wants to set you free from your
[1:03:23] condition
[1:03:24] amen hallelujah
[1:03:27] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:03:30] who is this Angel of the Lord amen he's
[1:03:32] come to set you free he has the title
[1:03:35] deed to your inheritance and he's come
[1:03:37] back for the title deed so that you can
[1:03:40] go free this morning you can Rise Up
[1:03:42] from your situation you can Rise Up from
[1:03:45] your condition

[1:03:51] God and there is nothing impossible with
[1:03:54] you who believed in this most like God
[1:04:01] amen amen many many men
[1:04:04] Hallelujah
[1:04:05] blessed be the name of the Lord amen so
[1:04:09] we are speaking about on the wings of
[1:04:11] the mighty Angel and we are speaking
[1:04:13] about the emancipator we showed you his
[1:04:16] characteristics and now he sets his
[1:04:18] people free how he delivers them from
[1:04:20] bondage how he strengthens amen and he
[1:04:24] will not allow God's people to be bound
[1:04:26] up within Prison Walls
[1:04:29] men
[1:04:30] so when the greatest prison was set up
[1:04:33] in Satan's Eden
[1:04:37] so that I imprisoned now
[1:04:43] Satan thinking he's got everyone on the
[1:04:46] earth deceived

[1:08:38] though it was pouring rain she made a
[1:08:40] way to that stadium
[1:08:42] and she began to call and they said the
[1:08:45] ashes couldn't keep her back in the
[1:08:46] meeting
[1:08:47] she was pressing her way through trying

[1:09:14] amen God will honor your faith God will
[1:09:17] honor your confession in many men yeah
[1:09:21] sometimes God answers in unusual ways
[1:09:24] and on your usual circumstances
[1:09:26] sometimes it won't even be the
[1:09:29] confession of your own faith but it'll
[1:09:31] be you agreeing with somebody else's

[1:09:36] that is why don't take testimonies
[1:09:38] lightly amen when somebody is Justified
