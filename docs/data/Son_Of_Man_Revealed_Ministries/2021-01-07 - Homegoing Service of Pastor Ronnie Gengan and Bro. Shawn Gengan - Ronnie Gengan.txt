the rest of the immediate family we want to extend our condolences to you because of the limited time that we have we'll get straight into the word of God I just want to read one portion of scripture and in the Book of Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 the Bible says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word hallelujah my brothers and sisters there was one time a great Caesar austa who won the Victory and won the battle and as he won the battle there was a celebration that they were going to give him in the land of Rome and uh in order to celebrate he wanted one worthy man to join him and my brothers and sisters he the news went around and all the soldiers and the army people they got ready and they shined up their armors and their swords and so on Hallelujah and they all lined up and when they lined up they went to King Cesar austa and as he looked at the first sergeant or or the general Hallelujah they were able to salute but he shook his head and he and and he passed by because Cesar austa was looking for one person and it didn't meet the requirements and eventually Soldier by Soldier they passed his aasta and after a short while there was a little footman he didn't have any Shield that was polished neither did he have any plume to trim but he walked in front of Caesar he didn't even know the right way to salute but he bowed his head and walked away Cesar said wait a minute who are you come back here he walked up and looked at him he said there's SCS over his face there's cuts and disness and crippled up where did you get them SCS at Cesar Augusta asked him and he said out in the battlefield fighting for my Lord Caesar and Cesar Augusta said climb up here sit down by my side you are the one that's been tested and proved my brothers and sisters a few days ago the same thing happened there was a greater than Cesar austa Hallelujah that came down Hallelujah he might have come to amas Hallelujah he might have come to marate he might have went to Peter marage birth but he found fot hallelujah amen to go past our pastor Ronnie genen together with our brother sea amen hallelujah and when he went there he found Hallelujah them to be good and Faithful Servants amen the Battle Scars of preaching the gospel the highways and the byways and he real realized that they needed a rest amen and because they needed a rest he said Hallelujah I want you to you didn't look for the salute amen he didn't look for a theological decree for that type of salute Hallelujah he wanted a soldier that was chosen before the foundation of the world was called by almighty God hallelujah and he found fit Hallelujah that these two Hallelujah gallon soldiers hallelujah amen torn from this life hallelujah amen to the batt scars of preaching the gospel through the highways and byways and he said come up join me Hallelujah they are now Hall what you see in the casket Hallelujah a mortal remains but their soul are in the sixth Dimension my brothers and sisters one day you and I are going to meet them Hallelujah in the portals of Glory but in order to do that my brothers and sisters we need to prepare our lives Hallelujah there was one time amen hallelujah out of the assembly line there was a Cadillac that came out amen it was in the showroom Hallelujah and while it was in the showroom Hallelujah all the wheel caps all the leather interior and everything was there and they filled the tank with gasoline Hallelujah and then the moment came when they put the key into the ignition and they tried to turn the key but unfortunately it did not start Hallelujah when the technician came Hallelujah he found that the spark plug was missing Hallelujah and my brothers and sisters if you want to meet up Hallelujah with our loved ones amen One of These Fine mornings Hallelujah when that Resurrection takes place we need to do one thing hallelujah amen we need to couple Hallelujah because when they turned the key they found there was no spark there was gasoline Hallelujah there was gasoline which was a mechanics amen but what was missing was the mechanics amen hallelujah you'll find two Cadillac part one was able to start one was not able to start you might be polished up you might be seated in the showroom of the message of the hour but I want to ask you my brothers and sisters hallel if you want to meet them you need to have that spark if you want to meet them hallelujah amen the prophet says there's too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the Dynamics amen the Dynamics is a spark Hallelujah that we need to have in our lives amen when they put the spark flag Hallelujah there was 10,000 Hallelujah horsepower Hallelujah that was able to start the Cadillac and that Cadillac was able to zoom down the road Hallelujah I know of one Hallelujah who whose name was Jesus Christ Hallelujah Once Upon a Time amen he was dead Hallelujah even the son testified that he was dead Hallelujah the moon testified that he was dead Hallelujah the Stars testified that he was dead amen hallelujah but on the third day amen he was the word Hallelujah Jesus Christ was the word he was the mechanics and the prophet of the hour says but there were Dynamics inside of Jesus Christ and on the third day Hallelujah the Dynamics coupled to the m mechanics gave him that resurrection power Hallelujah and I want to say with the with an assurance Hallelujah there is resurrection power in The Bride of Jesus Christ amen if Jesus Christ had the Dynamics and the mechanics in him Hallelujah the prophet says that she is him the bride is Christ Hallelujah so all that was in Christ is in the bride right now and we have the power to resurrect Hallelujah my brothers and sisters don't live in your formal condition as message Believers Hallelujah we might be shined up

family show your condolences as much as we would love to show one another our love and support unfortunately we are in this pred and we just ask you just keep your distance from the family and at this time we would like to proceed with the speeches first we' like to call our to give a speech on of God bless I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ uh this afternoon I have speaking on of my brother son Shan before I do that I would like to express the condolences of my wife and my sons to Sister Grace the children Shantel Adrian V the wives the husbands the grandchildren uh sister Patricia her father mother and the rest of the family my brother Ronnie was before I say that I just like to say that you know uh my brother Ronnie and Shan uh they're not really dead they just left this body that they used there on Earth their souls which is real brother Ronnie and real sha is gone now into the sixth Dimension that is the dimension of the blessed and to the family you know that is whaton was preaching about all his life so just remember that I know is going to be very difficult uh especially now in this time when you lost sister Grace lost her husband and her son uh but I know that the Lord will see all through we continuously pray for you all that God will comfort you all strengthen you and see you through this time my brother only was one of seven children we were two sisters and five brothers Brothers uh my one sister is surviving she's she's closer to 80 now and myself uh Ronnie uh you know we had a very hard life from the very beginning and we were we lost our dad when we were very young uh and my mother she look up seven children and she raised all of us and we all of us including brother Ronnie did our job by helping my mother uh you know uh buying vegetables in the Indian market and selling it they every day uh and mostly on weekends Saturdays I know brother Ronnie My Brother Jay myself we'll all go and help my mother and that's how she raised us up and she raised good children and my brother was one of them he was very humble kind polite never in normal life I saw him angry or upset or violent he survived many tragedies in his life one of them I remember when he was a young boy I think maybe about 12 or so we were living in second river and he went to the supermarket there and that Supermarket they had some very vicious dogs and when he went to the supermarket I don't know why that day they left the dogs open so one of the dogs got him LIF I think just above his his knee he had want to go surgery and he had many stitches and then also in life he also had a very serious accident when he uh and he broke his leg and I think he he his shoulder and other parts of his body and then he also had a bypass I think his triple or quadruple bypass and he survived all that by the grace of God and uh as I said I never saw him very angry he came through and done his duty and finished the cause his entire life was dedicated to preaching this gospel anytime you see him at home he's always reading listening to the message or doing something about the gospel and of course brother Sean is also a chip of the old block he's just like his dad very humble jial respectful very decent person I never saw him as well angry or unhappy whenever I saw him he was always happy he was always Jo and you know he got on very well with people you know the Bible says that we must train up our children the way they should go and when they grow up they will not depart from it and I can say that brother on has done a good job he trained his children up in the ways of the Lord and I'm sure that will always remain with them am I pray now and thank you uh uh for the family I pray uh especially now I know it's very but God will see your through thank you thank you bless you next we like to call our brother L give a speech also on of Sean and also our Ron [Music] God blessed brothers and sisters um my dad would have been the person giving speech but um he's not able to because brother was a very close friend of his and Sean being his son-in-law I think it's too much over for and the person that I he friends everywhere he and um thing is that you know Sean if he was angry with him to about something automatically changed because it was that's his nature he just smile at you and and that was way it would end and even UNC R um we've known him for many years um I think he close to about 30 plus uh little children we all played together and later on through life um we started dating my sister and married um but yeah we've been really close to them about I think a month or two back uh um Ron was at my house and came to visit and now Al also they we had quite a long conversation and and I think it was the first time actually did as one thing Ron always jokes with me is that he says know this guy doesn't eat Brown because in I was little I used to shouldn't like to get brown bread and uh now uh it's a very sad loss for us I think on all sides whether it's the church the family because they both were very close in that they both have the very same nature similar nature they both had an impact Sean was quite a good Music musician relationships with all different churches all different types of people and if you speak to anybody know but I know Sean either from Phoenix or Springfield Park or wherever he went he had friends and I think we've also seen that past Ronnie he's had friends all over the world and that speaks a lot about their nature and and the humbleness you know past would do a lot of things for people but you never hear him mention it my dad was just telling me the you know this and and the things that he did for people but it's never something that he would say even as a preacher never mention in front of anyone but you know he's he's a true man of God um and um and also like to say to brother Adrian and and and his family as well it must be a very difficult situation that can't imagine what the feeling is U I think a lot of us feel maybe a portion of it because um un was was Ronnie was our pastor um and Sean was also very active within the church and and and even with friends and and so on and most people that we that knew them we had a bond with with both of them it wasn't just one person and um I think for for my sister and and even his daughters it's it's a really difficult thing um and and at that point when this did take place we we were so positive about about him and as well communication was was something that we we didn't even think that things would turn out this way and uh just pray that God blesses and Comforts them is going to something that they going you know God's going to need to assist them through and I just like to thank a lord for for helping us and giving us thank you to that appreciate those kind words pastor and Sean next we have our brother Joshua CH who going to speak on behalf of both Pastor Ronnie and our brother Sean and he's going to also speak on behalf of our church son of man Ministries Joshua is a minister at our church and like greet our pastors Ministers of the Gospel saints of God family and friends the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on behalf of our assembly son of man revealed Ministries we would like to I like to say a few words on behalf of Pastor Ron genger also Our Shepherd and pastor and his precious son sh if I truly speak of the characteristics of P Ron it will take up volumes of words but truly he was a person of such remarkable character he left an imprint on you he was truly a man of God with a true calling in the office of the 54 Ministry under the office of a pastor he was not a person who was tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine but he preached sound Doctrine and never wavered as brother Adrian said to me the other day a Great Oak Tree had fallen Pastor Ronnie was very calculated in his decision if he had made a decision about something we could not convince him otherwise because he had already looked at the pros and cons he groomed young ministers in the church and always encouraged the progression of the music department he loved the worship and he loved the word he loved each family he knew every child individually he labored in the ministry always visiting families in their homes even when they were in hospital always cared for the sick always look after the widows he never wanted to be an old man and always said God must take him home and always spoke of how death was just a door to take you to your Eternal destination today is rejoicing in that that sixth Dimension the church will truly miss him and we will be waiting earnestly for the resurrection to take place to meet out to meet our pastor our precious brother Sean is one of the most humble meest and sweetest characters I personally knew he loves music and always compliments the band when he plays his keyboard Sean was very connected with his father in so many ways when he was young he worked with him for many years and in the ministry he assisted him in music and I believe today they are united in glory together on behalf of Son of Man reveal Ministries our heart goes out to Sister Grace brother Adrian sister shintel sister Leah sister Patricia jamaa Angelia suzan Bey AUM Zion William Joshua and Yuri
