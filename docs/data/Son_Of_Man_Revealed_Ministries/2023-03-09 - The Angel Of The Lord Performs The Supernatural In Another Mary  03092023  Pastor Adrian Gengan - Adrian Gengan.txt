this morning as we come into your most holy presence the songs of Zion have been sang Lord Lord we declare our faith Lord through the singing of the songs oh God and Lord we are under expectation of

Your Righteous if we can stand your holy we can stand here Justified we can stand your Sanctified we can stand your filled with the Holy Ghost we can stand your perfect oh God because of what you have done two thousand years ago Lord we know father there's nothing else you could do to add to it right now it's a finished work and anything Lord we receive we must believe it by faith oh God we love you and we appreciate you Lord Jesus Glory Be Your Name father I pray Lord that you'll be with us now even as we further continue in Jesus name amen amen greetings in the most holy the most precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ hello somebody amen in the most holy the most precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen who is worthy to be praised amen greet your brother and sister amen say welcome into the house of the Lord amen amen amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord hallelujah glory be to his name amen it's always a tense time when you come into the pulpit amen and you watch how the spiritual start to manifest to die and distract the preacher now you don't be part of that Spirit that's going to distract the preacher right now because if you know anything ministers are temperamental people Elijah was a very temperamental man the prophet is amen because they're under the anointing and anything that triggers it they will Slaughter it there they don't care about your feelings if you need to be put in order they'll put you in order because the spirit of God is most important to us right now amen hallelujah we haven't come here in vain this is not a social club this is not something amen that we promote people to just come together amen but we are under the revealed word of the hour we come under the banner of the message of the hour amen amen amen praise the Lord he's worthy to be praised amen so amen let's turn to Mark chapter 9 verse 23 amen hallelujah Mark chapter 9 and verse 23 amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen glory be to his name how many of you know it's the ninth month and what year is it now that which the Lord started at the beginning of the year nine months later whatever seed was sown in you if you haven't already received it let this be the month of your manifestation how many of you have received some of the visions and the things that you've asked the Lord for I mean if you're still waiting for some things to come to pass amen now in the natural if it takes nine months foresee that's sown into the right womb for it to develop and to be fully formed it must come forth we don't want any overtime babies neither do we want premature babies but that which the Lord had birthed within us and put within us it's time for the manifestation of it amen so Mark 9 and 23 says praise the Lord foreign to him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth now it's very important to understand that we can do nothing except believe amen many times we think that we need to get involved with something amen you may be seated the Lord had blessings you the reading of his word amen now pay very specific attention because when instruction is coming from the pulpit if you are not hearing what the minister is saying you will miss your blessing things will never come to pass in your life was Naaman asked to go and baptize in the River Jordan was that a specific instruction coming from the 5-4 ministry as long as he disobeyed it he never received his healing amen so angels are ministering Spirits coming through the fivefold ministry amen that's a quote of the Prophet amen hallelujah so you got to take specific instruction amen when the word of God is coming in order for you to live a fruitful and a successful life you can treat it casual and think it's just a word of a man amen and that's why you'll never see the manifestation amen so speaking something is one thing but Jesus is teaching Us in Mark 11 23 that man was supposed to be the the one who has dominion over the Earth he had no faith to believe his own word amen let's close that door he says if you believe what you have said shall come to pass now I want you to know Jesus did not say now I'm saying this for a specific reason because many times we think we need to get involved with the supernatural the only thing we need to do is cooperate with the spirit of God cooperate with the angel of God and believe the word it's already done if there's one thing I want you to understand it's already done at the cross of calvary there's nothing further you can do if you think okay I'm gonna get my healing by fasting and praying then that's you putting your own effort into it fasting and praying never healed anyone the only thing that heals what does fasting and praying do praying amen you're taking your prayer request before the Lord and fasting is bringing your flesh under subjection of the spirit man because the flesh is unbelief the flesh wants to disbelieve the things of God amen but the spirit man needs to rise up by faith and believe the things of God so fasting is to bring the body under subjection amen we need right teaching in the church because sometimes you come in the prayer line and and you think that Mark 16 is not effective and that your fasting and praying is more effective than mark 16. Mark 16 is the written word of God and it supersedes your natural fasting and praying the problem is the believing in John 3 16 if you put it up where's the quote the scriptures you put it up in John 3 16 does it say there God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever for goes to fasting and praying shall receive eternal life what must they do believe there is nothing you can do to your salvation to add to it there's nothing you can do to your healing to add to it foreign if the church gets this Revelation now she can do the Greater Works it was already done at Calvary but it seems that man does not want to believe these things we feel we need to go back to the law and add to it I need to do this my righteousness I need to do this but if you can just come to God and believe it Lord you said Lord but by your stripes I am already healed you say that on the cross when you bore my sin in your body on the cross my sin was taken away it was a Divine exchange that I understand you're sinless you see even with that we struggle that we confess things like I'm not perfect then you are not talking out of the abundance of your heart from the spirit man and thinking Looking Through The Eyes of Christ because Christ has made you perfect we say things like I am not righteous I am not perfect but then we are talking from a carnal point of view we are not looking to the finished work of the Cross and I stand here in his righteousness I stand you in his Perfection I stand you in his holiness amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen so let's get started that was just a warmer amen how many of you like warmers amen praise the Lord praise the Lord glory be to his name Amen Let me just give my notes to you then you can take this amen praise the Lord so we're looking at these three women and we were in Genesis Chapter 18 and we seem to have got a bit stuck there but it's fine because it's packed amen Genesis 18 he's packed and we find that Abraham is sitting at the plains of mamre if you go to Genesis 18 and we we learned already that a membrane means strength so he was now sitting at the place of strength when East strength was gone his strength is perfect when our strength is gone and this is what Abraham was singing that morning because in you now at the age of 99 years old his strength was gone his ability to reproduce was gone but his strength is perfect when our strength is gone and Abraham was saying Sarah he'll carry us when we can't carry on amen Sarah was saying oh I don't know you know Sarah wasn't moving in faith in this time and she was saying hey I don't know and if you read this particular message you say Sarah was a little fussed that morning how many of you read that the prophet is dramatizing it and he says Sarah was a little fussed that morning and you know she was like thinking how Lot's wife has got this new dresses and the new fashions and here she's sitting in the desert amen here she's sitting in the desert while Lot's wife is enjoying the pleasures of Sodom and Gomorrah amen praise the Lord but we don't look to those things amen we look far above these things amen hallelujah praise the Lord now just for con so we remember we read that Genesis 18 right so he's sitting in the place of strength and I want to get to verse 10 there and this is so I'm going to speak a thought and maybe I'll title it the angel of the Lord performs a supernatural in another Mary amen the angel of the Lord right now is performing the supernatural in another Mary so 1810 he tells Abraham now you'll find the verses preceding this the Lord does not speak it's only Abraham moving into action and saying I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this there's no word from Thee the angels when they finally settle down and they start to entertain his presence amen and yeah the prophet says that the house was in order therefore they they were amen candidates for the association to the ancient world they didn't have to go and hide magazines didn't have to put the TV off they didn't have to put the internet off amen and I'm if you know that he'll appear to you when you are thinking on him Abraham was not there on Google and uh looking at Facebook and looking at tick tock watching the clock tick tock tick tock tick tock so idle amen so either thinking and and they watch these things now because you'll hear it in your homes I'm so bored go watch a movie I'm so bored not once will we say could read this message I was blessed with this one or go read this chapter tell me what you think about it I'm so bored go listen to some music amen but obviously I'm not talking about you now I'm talking about Abraham and his family amen hallelujah we're not talking about anybody here amen hallelujah because you should see the Angelic looks around here I see those Halos amen maybe we can turn these monitors down a bit amen I see the Halos amen praise the Lord amen What Angels so here in verse 10 he says I will return and when he's coming back he's not coming without a vision without a goal without a purpose he is returning for a purpose I'm coming to thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son now when you hear the word son you think about the Life of Christ that should be at the top of our mind it should be our goal we must produce the Life of Christ Sarah thy wife because yeah Isaac is going to type the Lord Jesus Christ Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it but Faith did not come by the hearing of this word she had to hear it again that's why the Bible says faith cometh by hearing and hearing there's a two hearing there the first time matchboxam curiosity that you laugh within yourself but at the second hearing amen hallelujah something raises up within you and Sarah judges him faithful Sarah heard it in the ten door she was behind him now we're going to drop two verse uh let's go 11 there Abraham and Sarah yeah re-emphasizing now that he's not going to be human interference Abram and Cyril were old and well-stricken in age and it seems to be with Sarah after the man of woman so what does it tell you she can't have children her body is old the prophet will go on to describe it you hear it in the messages the mug veins are dried up amen hallelujah she was past menopause so she couldn't physically according to science have a child therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also some are thinking that I'm so old in the message you mean now I have to do certain things oh I'm too young in the message amen and the Lord said unto Abraham so everything is right now he's got the new name he's got the new nature the mystery of God is revealed to him everything he said in order for this Angelic visitation amen wherefore now here's the discernment with the back turned this is what the prophet is doing now according to Luke 17 30 as it was in the days so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man so the prophet would turn his back to the audience and you see your sister there on the left you have a tumor amen praise the Lord so the back turn to the tent he discerns Sarah's heart you watch even till today the people that want to move in an impersonation and an anointing study the life of William Branham in fact they studied more than you and I they study how to operate in the Supernatural you should hear them talk about it foreign because they're lusting after the gift after the anointing but they will never attain this level of anointing there's his guesswork because this was son of man being revealed through the prophet it was Jesus Christ being reproduced so he says shall I have now she laughs within herself but the love to carry some thoughts and the thoughts were he deserves what she was thinking now shall I of Surety be a child which I am hold now remember Abraham and the angel is having a conversation but the Lord is Discerning what Sarah is saying and suddenly he tells Abraham he's anything too hard for the Lord so Abraham is probably wondering what's happening here he doesn't know that Sarah's art is being discerned so he asked Abraham is anything too hard for the Lord and I don't think that the Lord's response was not with some kind of reprimand because somebody is just believing remember what what the prophet is teaching us now the Lord would have slower there for the unbelief he says but because of Abraham and that was the bidding ground for Isaac he couldn't kill her because the two were one Abraham and Sarah right is anything too hard for the Lord Abraham probably get startled at the appointed time I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen oh glory be to his name amen Sarah thy wife shall have a son not eager not the Bond woman the free woman not that you know the national churches the free women amen then Sarah now watch she denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou teats laugh and that's all we hear about it amen the next year is when the Apostle Paul is talking about it and says Serve by faith Sarah judged him faithful amen why he discerned the heart she knew like the woman at the well nobody else knows that I taught these things nobody else knows about my life now I'm asking you is anything too out for the Lord some of you have given up on your prayer some of us have given up and you're believing on your trusting God some of you have decided that you're going to live with that sickness until death some of you have taken the doctor's report that this that's an incurable disease but is anything too hard for the Lord amen at the appointed time the Lord is going to touch you and deliver you what's your point of time God is waiting for you to believe Mark 9 23 if thou can't believe all things are possible amen now if you've been following the Angel's instruction from the beginning of the year you should be at a point now we are ready to believe all things are possible amen remember when the Lord is building he's not haphazard in his building we can't keep going back to the foundation even the Apostle Paul says it amen let us lay aside these things amen like baptisms and godheads and all of these things and let us move on to Perfection our goal is perfection amen praise the Lord so here we find an uh 89 year old woman that God is going to do a work now why is that chapter very important is because it's a hidden Mystery that these two nobody knows us now beside the message world because of a prophetic gift that Sarah and Abraham were changed back into a young body do you know that nobody else believes that besides you Sarah and Abraham were turned back into a young body amen so that is a type of what's going to happen to us now we have had that same Angel come back with a message to us so what is Genesis 18 from 1 to 15 telling us about the creator of power of God and he's speaking the creator of power into you who spoke it did Abraham speak it who spoke creative power there I was not the one doing it I was only the vessel you'll tell him in the audience amen I don't know what the the angel just told you amen he's using my body you may have heard my voice but it was the angel of the Lord here in Luke 1 26 now the prophet is telling uh the the Bible here is writing and he's saying in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man whose name was Joseph right and the virgin's name was Mary now remember our topic is the Angel of the Lord is performing the supernatural in another Mary amen and the angel came in unto her and said hell Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women wouldn't you like to receive a salutation like that amen but you have received a salutation like that because you are another Mary amen amen the angels of God on earth now because of you or somebody now come on amen get your mind off of work get your mind off your chicken curry get your mind off your amen lunch amen focus on the things of God now these things are amen mean more to us than the Natural Things amen this is not for your soul this is now for your eternal life this is now for your new body and unless you connect with the Angel's message you will not receive the rapturing faith for this hour so I want you to know all of you believe the message of the hour you are highly favored amongst all you know I'm a national women and when he saw him she was troubled that he sing and cast to mind what man of salutation this should be right so she's not troubled at any other thing beside I mean you're calling me highly favored she's troubled at the saying and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with god oh thank you Lord if you see yourself as Mary you start to Rejoice with these things now thank you Lord that I have found favor in your sight amen behold here's another one now who's this one talking the same one in Genesis 18. and the angel said unto her thou shall conceive in thy womb this is verse 31 now and bring forth a son and his name Shall be Called Jesus first through Sarah it was a Shadow His Name Shall be Called Isaac now through Mary He Shall be Called Jesus oh and I can imagine can you imagine what an explosion there must have been in the Heavenly atmosphere at the first time this name was mentioned Faith cometh by the hearing of the word and the first time now somebody is hearing the name Jesus is Mary these other Jesus is out there but there's only one that believes there's only one Mary who believes the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new the others are trinitarians the others there's three unclean spirits like frogs who believes in a trinity gospel but there's only one woman who heard his name his name Shall be Called Jesus some of you think it's a Christmas message well Christmas is coming early receive the gifts don't wait for Christmas gifts the gifts is pouring itself out now amen hallelujah and he shall be great oh thank you God that you are great he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and his kingdom there shall be no end then sent Mary unto the angel how shall it be seeing I know no man and the angel answered unto and said unto her the Holy Ghost oh how we need the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God amen and I want you to know that same Holy Ghost is here to birth The Life of Christ in you and Mary said now what's your response this is what makes Mary above all other women afraid to believe if thou can't believe then all things are possible and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word I don't know if you want to say that this morning being unto me according to your word oh God I don't want to leave nothing out to God and the angel is satisfied and he departs from her it's as good as finished amen it's as good as finished the birth of the Supernatural is now going to perform in Mary what's happening yeah he's the spoken word there was not another time the spoken word came back the Angel's voice that said there in verse 35 . in verse 31 and 35 is the spoken word that is where the spoken word that is like what Adam was supposed to be speaking to Eve come on now let's go to Genesis Genesis there was not supposed to be a sexual affair to reproduce what you are seeing is what Adam is supposed to be doing he's supposed to go to Eve and say thou shalt have a son and his name Shall be Called Abel and Eve was supposed to say be it unto me according to Thy Word amen praise the Lord now let's go to our part we the Mary now and yo the same Angel talked to us Revelation 10 8. same Angel and we are so privileged to have a picture of it and the voice which I heard from Heaven speak unto me again God can do it again I love it when he speaks to me again amen go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel with standard upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book you see our association is directly with the angel of God you know we got married many elizabeths we got do you want to be an Elizabeth in the message of the hour or do you want to be a Mary because Elizabeth is only going to present John the Baptist but Mary is going to present the Christ we got many elizabeths presenting the second Forerunner come on religious message people we got many Elizabeth's in the message of the hour the only thing they talk about is John the Baptist but Mary another Mary when he's pick up your opinion right he's not saying as the word was in Elizabeth so shall the word be indeed he's saying as the word was in Mary so yeah give me the little book and he said take it instruction eat it and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey sometimes it feels like the faithful Ministry has to force your mouth open and push the word inside amen because of the unbelief of the people because of the spirits that's lingering around us amen that's bringing unbelief and fear and reasoning into the church this is supposed to be the most powerful Church the most Supernatural church amen with signs and wonders following amen not a dead Church a lazy Church a weak church and talking about the body of Jesus Christ the most powerful Army on the face of the Earth not artificial intelligence but Supreme intelligence they have the mind of Christ amen hallelujah and I took the book out of the Angel van and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey you see it's one thing to receive instruction it's another thing that you go and do it but John was the type of the bride goes and he takes that word they find these messages amen the scripture becomes more clear to them and they devour it amen it's sweet in your mouth you tell it to everybody but amen inside something it's killing the inner man oh sorry he's killing the outer man it's killing the flesh man it's bringing the flesh man under subjection sweet in your mouth but it's better in your belly in your flesh is the belly part of your flesh amen so my flesh is getting bitter my flesh is dying my flesh is rotting the more I eat of this word now it's not where it ends even if you go and read I don't have time right now because amen we need to move here if you go and read Luke one day after the angel comes to Mary after she meets Elizabeth go here Mary prophesying you know Mary prophesy so there's your homework go and read Luke chapter one and you'll see after she meets Elizabeth and the Babe leaps within Elizabeth Mary goes to prophesying come on that's the type now of this Revelation 10 11. Mary goes to prophesying maybe we should put it up because some of you won't go and read it amen put up Luke chapter one there let's find it after she meets Mary amen hallelujah praise the Lord some of you already said I'm not going to read it hey some of you already said I'll wait for Christmas to read it that's my Christmas stories amen let's put it up let's make time because it's very important to show you that as the word was in Mary and she went to prophesying now you saw John taking the book and the word is what is the word Jesus said the word is a this is direct Bible now the word is a seed so when John is taking the word he's receiving seed let me tell you something that this message of the hour that you eat can produce nothing else but the Life of Christ yes she's now prophesying and my soul don't magnify the Lord and my spirit had rejoiced in God my savior for here regard to the lowest state of his handmade and Beyond from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed right for he that is mighty had done to me great things and holy is his name watches and start to step up a prophecy now and his Mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation he had shown strength with his arm and he had scattered the proud in the imaginations of their hearts he had put down the mighty from the seats and exalted them of low degree he had filled the angry with good things and the rich he had sent empty away Jesus is not even born yet but she is seeing those things is already finished he had holy oh open helped his servant Israel in remembrance of his Mercy amen and it's as you speak to our fathers Abraham and to his seed forever amen so she goes to prophesy she's talking about it as it's a finished work amen she's only so Mary was I think she just at that time I just conceived Elizabeth was six months old when she meets the baby in Elizabeth was just six months old right not even six months old what am I saying she was caring for six months amen she was just catering for six months with child so look at how Mary goes to prophesy and that's the type here now I hope you can see it but clearly now that you are the Mary that is taking the book from the hand of the angel the same angel that spoke to Mary the same angel that spoke to Sarah how many angels Don't Die there's never been a funeral service for an angel amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord and I'm so glad that this morning the angel of the Lord that's here he's looking at you and saying you know what I last saw that faith in in Branham I lost saw that kind of faith in Paul ah nobody's receiving that Allah for that kind of faith in Mary amen don't be now the angel thing is Elizabeth amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord please don't sleep on me I'm gonna get angry now amen just keep amen keep the spirit keep the spirit of the service amen praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord if you need to stand up stand up and say praise the Lord amen see start to call those things that are not as though they are just stand up and say I'm not sleepy anymore call those things that are not as though they are say praise the Lord I'm full of life praise the Lord I had a good night's sleep amen amen Hallelujah just stand up and praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm receiving that word I'm not rejecting it amen whatever you are thinking right now stand up and praise the Lord and say thank you Lord I'm believing what the pastor is saying I don't wish for him to stop now start to give your body a shock see what happened to this person now they're going spiritual on me hey so the birth of the supernatural in another Mary okay so you got now verse 11 there of Revelation 10 thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and kings amen so nine months has passed and it's time to do a spiritual sonogram you know what's the sonogram now brother Caleb you don't know what do you go for scans or you call it scan ultrasound you call it it's the same thing okay just update your memory there we are doing a spiritual sonogram and some of your sisters helped me you know there's some women who think they are pregnant and they're not what they call it is it Braxton something that's a phantom pregnancy do you know there's some women who actually believe that they are pregnant but when they go to the doctor they're not pregnant this is something you don't know these things right now we are doing a spiritual sonogram on you you know what that is some of you don't know what that is so a woman when she's pregnant after certain weeks how many weeks is it after how many weeks you go how many months come on sisters who had babies just tell me amen halleluia amen thank you Lord how many weeks 12 weeks okay now you go to the doctor they woke you up to this machine they put some gel there and they put this thing on you and then machine now projects an image and you can see some life and that doctor is going to town then he's measuring this and you can't see nothing there but he's saying you can see you saying yeah I can see it it's the leg here this is the leg you say yeah that's a leg bone this is this this is that you're believing everything he's saying amen now if you can believe the doctor that way how about you believe the ministers that way whatever they're showing you in the word about yourself even if you don't know what that they're telling you this is your leg you say yes that's my leg amen so they start to put that sonogram and they start to see that baby there then they can identify as heartbeat and they place it there that strategic point and they leave it there and okay that's another thing on another machine and it registers the heartbeat and they can tell you the heartbeat of the baby amen so I'm saying the holy spirit is here this morning and he's doing a spiritual sonogram it's been nine months but if your baby is only three months something is wrong developed three months some of it and what I am talking about is what you've been praying about because this is how man is man don't believe his own word but God is putting you back in that position if you can believe you know you believe unto salvation you just have to believe that Jesus did it all there's nothing else you can do but believe amen healing is the same way the prophet says if you can believe that the Lord has saved you he says it's the same thing that the Lord has healed you now I want you to know this and I'm making a strong statement here when Jesus Christ you know they say the 39 Stripes was for every disease why I'm saying it's a strong statement I even want heaven to hear this this morning that all manner of diseases were taken care of at the cross so there's not a sickness on the Earth today that Jesus Christ didn't pay the price for come on now I don't need to bring Jesus back down to earth and whoop him for one more sickness are you hearing what I'm saying don't think that your sickness is incurable if you are telling me your sickness is incurable you're telling me that I need to bring Jesus back on the earth now and give him one more stripe for that sickness that the doctor is saying is incurable tell him doctor you may say it's incurable but the Bible says that by his stripes I am healed and when Jesus resurrected again he resurrected in a glorified body and every wound on his back was healed he is not standing here with a gaping open wound every hoon is healed and body you've got to obey my confession now you really got to confess and believe don't stand there and confess with your mouth and you don't believe in your heart it won't work this is now instruction to the church when you speak you've got to believe in your heart confess with your mouth and believe in your heart stop thinking Jesus is a lucky charm you need to believe don't you think I'm just gonna hurt it casually and then you go on living a life of unbelief amen let's just get to our quotes quickly amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah let's just go to the first one I just want to stir your faith up a butcher now there was a little boy doctors didn't even know what was the matter with him his lungs was very very bad they couldn't put him in school or something now the Holy Spirit right after the message is the holy spirit speaking this morning so watch for your Miracle now spoke to that little boy and called him told him his conditions and so forth and pronounce his healing and this week he went back to the doctor the doctor said he had a new set of lungs see new set of lungs is anything too hard for the Lord this isn't the message desperations now first of September it's in the ninth month 63. amen praise the Lord now he goes on to see here now God the Creator can make a new set of lungs God can give you a new heart amen every Cancer is cell in your body I speak to it and I say be renewed in the name of Jesus every clogged artery must be open in the name of Jesus and blood is flowing through your arteries there is no blockages in my arteries my sugar level is normal my blood pressure is normal God the Creator can make a new set of

Prophet is saying look Zechariah stayed right there when the angel left him he was stricken dumb you see Zacharias does believe the angel and he went down maybe that's why people can't say Amen

that's what we have to do amen that's what we have to do oh praise the Lord let's go to the next one see if you can make this thing bigger can you edit it just make the text bigger because here here is what you're going to imagine it's so small but you're going to have to scrutinize this text because you know what the prophet is saying is going to shock you because you think we're pulling out these things about spare parts missing Limbs and things out of the air the prophet already preached these things you see within your knees brother Ramesh what is there this joins ball joints and there's liquids there I don't know what all there you can have all of that replaced amen he says well we have to believe The Impossibles to see new life to see in your life you have to believe The Impossibles amen you know the doctor told her stop taking the cancer medicine why the cells have rejuvenated amen but when you believe the impossible if the doctor says you've got cancer and you're dying you've got to believe the impossible to see new life take a hold of you so you never ever confess and tell anyone that I have cancer you tell everyone I have I don't know what the right term is

Provo don't have time to go on and describe everything whatever it is right now bring it forth in you Hallelujah God will do it if you will take him at his word if thou can't believe Mark 9 23 all things are possible I'm telling you in the season of the nine month amen I'm expecting to see amen we've seen the supernatural already amen brother Jeff was going to testify one of these days and tell

is whatever you believe in the Lord for he is saying God will do it if you take him at his word now she had no evidence of it is all you got no evidence of it only his word oh I like that I think right now stop wait a minute and I said I Don't Preach to everyone that lives right on the highway I have to go down the lane sometimes to pick up somebody you see that's what we're doing this morning we're coming down to you you thought you had to live with a certain thing you thought amen there's no hope for you amen you know I'm gonna say this now when the prophet is saying whatever it is some of us are thinking just in the realm of the five senses the body I am saying the holy spirit is going beneath that right now there's some that are struggling with loneliness here you know loneliness is a real thing that can lead to depression that can lead to anxiety make you insecure about yourself amen make you think that nobody loves you nobody cares about you but the holy spirit is Discerning your heart and he's telling you he can go into your spirit realm and heal your memory your conscience your imagination your affection amen you know in the night amen when you're crying yourself to sleep because you're feeling lonely and you think that nobody's for everyone's forgotten about you and nobody loves you you've forgotten that there's one who said I will never leave you nor forsake you lo I will be with you always amen hallelujah so drive out every negative word you don't receive any negative word and allow you to settle in your spirit when they tell you you are ugly when they tell you amen you are good for nothing when they tell you amen hallelujah all men of things I'm talking to you school children now because that's where bullying goes on and that's awaken and suppress your spirit man within you you can never rise up the child is never free you find the child goes into a shell and it becomes reserved because they are hearing words that have spoken to them and they never ever hear Mommy and Daddy tell them you are beautiful they never ever hear that you are the best thing that ever happened to me and they never hear those words I love you now I'm saying this because you younger folks here younger brothers and sisters you need to change that pattern because amongst the Indian Community it was a bit taboo to tell somebody you love them and maybe the Indian Community didn't express it or verbalize it that way they thought maybe by just doing things and providing for it that they'll be able to see my love expressed amen but we are living in the time of the spoken word amen because sometimes all the child can maybe just read is because when you're angry with them you don't keep quiet they they hear those words being coming out of your mouth now when you're happy with them they don't hear anything good you're like oh child read my mind father loves you from the depth of his heart we are living in the time of the spoken word how many of you want to break generational curses how many of you want to change the atmosphere Hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord you know when you're living in the Supernatural realm your flesh man you you do things with that hey this flesh man starts to get puzzled and sing hey what's wrong with this brother the sister they're making me now go in front of my son and tell son I'm proud of you I love you hey that sound is like you I need aircon here hey praise the Lord amen so we're living in the time in the season now we're new hand new harm new lungs new stomach whatever it is God would do it for you if you take him at his word if you take him at his word amen some of you trust in the Lord for a partner in this life you need to trust the Lord and seek him amen go read Genesis there 24. how the angel of the Lord is now directing really easy to find a partner amen say say same Angel of the Lord come and find my partner bring me to him now you people in school I don't want you to be thinking this and praying now okay I'm not talking to you I see the way closed the eyes and they started to pray and everything now right I'm not talking to you now you trust the Lord for every area of your life your cupboard is running dry say thank you Lord I am praying today when I open this cupboard this thing you know I'll share this quick testimony Autumn's phone wasn't working for about four weeks how many weeks but quite some time three four weeks so it refused to work and we tried all things we haven't left it charging and everything for days it never worked so anyway when you came to work with the Joshua Thursday I was telling you this testimony so Thursday I'm sitting at work and I like to listen to testimonies as I'm working so I'm listening to this testimony and I'm listening to this auntie and she's talking about these phones and I'm thinking hey I must put this thing off now because his auntie is rattling on and on and you know she's giving testimonies I want to go to another testimony but anyway something within me tell me listen to what she's saying so she's going on and on and talking she's saying she had this broken phone and she took it to the cell phone shop and they tried to repair it they couldn't repaid so she brought it back home and she prayed for the phone and she says the phone is working and that was a testimony now right so then that caught my attention now I said hey I got a broken phone if this woman is praying to the Lord and trusting the Lord to repair the phone through prayer I said I got the phone in my bag now why can't I apply the same faith so I pull out the phone I put it on charge nothing is happening I said I'm not looking at the symptom right now I'm leaving this phone there and the next time I look at you you shall be charging so I carried on working then my phone if you know what I'm going to say I'm not going to say the number but you know what I'm talking about so my I'm working working and I look up at my phone and I see the battery percentage is a certain number when I saw that the first thing that struck my mind was because remember the number is tied to the angel of the Lord the first thing that said I need to pull this thing I look at the phone and there it is charging and it's working till today now while I'm sitting there somebody something came there and sorted that phone out did he say whatever it is did Jesus say in Mark 9 23 put that scripture up again if thou can't believe only the things that I dictate to you shall be possible Jesus said all things are possible do you know that this is a scripture that they wrote that song only believe out of Mark 9 23. how many of you are remembering it Mark 9 23 remember this verse he thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth all things are possible to you amen you know there they was telling this MOS the prophet calls him most they was going to send him into this place and he says Moses you believe the word of God so much he says yes he says whatever what happens if I tell you run through this wall yeah he says I believe the word so much that if the word of God tells me that I need to run through that wall by the time I get to that wall there shall be a exit there a hole in the wall for me to go through it but now the psalmist said he put it there in Prophecy shall we leap over walls that leap of a walls means shall we change dimensions shall we run through a troop when the when he is writing it he's not aware that there's going to be 200 million demons on the Earth a troop he's not aware that Revelation amen chapter 6 he's going to talk about the fourth house Rider who's a writer's name is death and Hell follows him and he's given power to kill with sword with famine amen so watch these things we are going to leap over a wall we are going to change dimensions amen before I believe before you see it change amen let's just go to this one quote here I have so much here but unfortunately I don't have time to go through all of it right now amen we'll take it up in another service amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen let's go to that slide 17. we'll close on this one because we believe we are in another time like Enoch right he says now as we see the time that Nimrod had brought all the Confederation together have they brought one world religion now have you noticed how the pope has gone out of the spotlight you don't hear much about him because the peace agreements have all been signed the final agreement for world religions to unite has been signed already so who's in the news USA right remember it's that's Revelation 13 now and made all people come to Babylon and come into this great Confederation are we in another Babylon and the time of all evil going on between women sexually and so forth at the same time God had a witness on Earth Enoch we are the Enoch right who walked with God blameless and at the same time that evil was appearing Angels appeared on Earth now you didn't know that right you can't read that in the Bible hello but the prophet is telling you what happened to Enoch Angels appeared on the earth Angelic beings moved in to man amen praise the Lord our association with the angel of the Lord amen we told you that Mark 11 23 11 is the eleventh hour Gentile workers Exodus 23 23 behold I send my an angel before thee so our association with the Angelic world amen so just I pray amen you gleaned from that this morning that the angel of the Lord is on earth now to perform the supernatural in another Mary how many of you believe that amen that the Lord can do exceedingly abundantly in your heart in your life now I want you to get this anything you believe in the Lord for when you speak it check if it's just in your head I'm telling you this now to give you instruction check whether when you're speaking it don't leave it till you find it settled in your heart and you're at peace with it because the word of God says when you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart if you find you're confessing with your mouth and it's up here only then it's head knowledge it's head Faith nothing is going to happen so you've got to hear that word over again spend time with Mark 9 23 spend time with Mark 11 23 look at the scriptures of God that will build your faith for that situation the prophet says if you have need of healing he says focus on the scriptures that deal with healing call up Isaiah 53 call up 1 Peter 2 24 read the scriptures read the gospels how Jesus healed surround yourself with the scriptures that deal with healing and your faith will increase amen so when you are praying for something didn't Jesus say if you believe in your heart so check that one thing because I find that's one thing that you yourself can know trigger whether that prayer is going to be answered or not because Jesus says believe that you have already received what you have asked for but you'll know if it's just here you're just praying it mindlessly oh Lord I heard the preacher saying that now how the past is saying this so I'm just going to pray Lord I believe I received it but let it settle in your heart if you can believe in your heart then you can have what you have said amen amen Give the Lord a good handclap of Praise amen let's Stand Together amen praise the Lord so the angel of the Lord is here right now to perform the supernatural in you in me Hallelujah amen Hallelujah we were reading Romans 8 23 on Wednesday creation is waiting for you to wake up amen creation is waiting for you to wake up amen creation is waiting for you to awaken awaken to your potential to walk in it to fulfill it to manifest it this is the time the angel that said I shall visit you according to the time of life let me tell me tell you the time of life is here he's here to visit you and touch you even now believing amen trusting the Lord amen Hallelujah don't be remember there was a 89 year old woman who reasoned amen but there was a young virgin who didn't reason she believed it has the word was in Mary so shall he be formed in thee amen praise the Lord Mary was another type of a woman Mary was a pure virgin woman who believed the Angel's word as soon as she heard it amen Singh let your word be born in the manger of my heart from D amen just prepare your heart now I believe the Lord will do something special for
