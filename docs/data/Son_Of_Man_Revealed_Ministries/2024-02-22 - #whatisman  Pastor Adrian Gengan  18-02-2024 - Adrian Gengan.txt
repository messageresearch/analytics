amen but the bride has light amen the bride has a word that's keeping her going amen the bride has secret food amen amen Bless The Name of Jesus Amen I know if you enjoyed last week's message what is a woman amen then it's only fitting we speak on what is aen amen hallelujah it's only fting we speak on what is a man amen what is man the age old question what is man now the woman don't need to feel excluded this morning because woman finds her identity in man yes you can't yes man is not complete without the woman so when we are speaking about what is a man we speaking also about the woman amen and this Revelation ought to Rejoice our hearts amen I tell you if any of us are not rejoicing here this morning then we have no representation we have see Gene within us amen because I asked you where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy amen the morning Stars began to sing amen amen where were you yes Hallelujah I guarantee you if you were there amen you wasn't sitting somewhere quiet in a corner but you were rejoicing amen with hello him hallelujah hallelujah amen amen let's turn to Job chapter 7 I'm going to take three portions of scripture and show you three Genesis you know um job you know is one of the oldest books in the Bible amen one of the oldest men so he's asking a question we're going to find the Apostle Paul echoing the question and King David so you're going to find it there in the beginning you're going to find it in the Psalms and you're going to find it here in the New Testament amen so job 7:1 17 says what is man that thou should us Magnify Him am amen and thou should set thine heart upon him and that thou should us visit him every morning and try him every moment now job is the one who starts out this question cuz it's a time period that passed since man had fallen and they couldn't understand the glory that man had with God so he begins to question what is man that thou should us Magnify Him and that thou should us set thine heart upon him and that thou should us visit him every morning and try him every moment we go to the book of Psalm 8:3 amen Psalm 8:3 says when I consider the heavens what is Heaven's creation amen the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou has ordained what is man yes amen now you you're studying galaxies you're studying stars but your question is not based on that he's pointing you to the heavenlies but he's asking you what is man that thou are mindful of him and the son of man that thou visited visitest him for thou has made him a little lower than the Angels you see even this is going a confus the Angelic realm you he's saying you made man a little lower than the Angels amen and has crowned him with Glory and Honor thou has made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands and thou has put all things under his feet amen you see David is acknowledging that this man is not is is made lower than Angels but how come you put him in authority of all things that has put all things in injection under his feet amen I'm going to read it again because some sickness may be over your head this morning some problem may be over your your head this morning but the Bible is saying here that thou has put all things under his subjection amen amen thou has put all things under his feet thank you all the Sheep The Oxen y the Beast of the field the fowl of the air the fish of the sea and whatsoever passes through the parts of the sea oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth so when man has Dominion the name of the Lord becomes excellent on the earth because he is representing God on the earth you may be seated as we go to Hebrews chap 2 and verse 5 now we come to New Testament we'll see the Apostle Paul speaking to us here amen he says For unto the angels have he not put in subjection the world to come you see it's not given to Angels whereof we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou are mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him Thou made him lower than the Angels thou crownest him with glory and honor and this set him over the works of thine hand thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him oh I hope you're reading my Bible there is nothing amen thank you Lord amen thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under his feet he left nothing that is not put under him amen amen amen hallelujah but now we see not yet all things put under him time and season can be put yet why Revelation amen amen it's locked up it's locked up for an end time people amen yes amen but I've got good news for you this morning now is the time now is the season amen when all things are put under our feet amen glory be to His holy name amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord am amen so men have men have probed this question who am I yes where did I come from where am I going yeah you'll find these three questions man has to answer who am I what's my identity where did I come from where am I going is there meaning to life now the study of science has said that man evolve from a lower being I want you to know that's aive from the pit of Hell yes amen we'll show you in the Bible that God created man man did not evolv from a monkey and a chimpanzee matter of fact there's a little story the child you must have read this child went to the to the to the father and said Dad where did man come from and the father said well man evolved from monkeys and chimpanzees so he go goes to his mother and he says mom where does man come from and the mother tells him that we were created in the image and the likeness of God Amen and then he tells his mom but Mom Dad says that we evolve from chimpanzees the mother said well he's talking about his side of the family amen hallelujah now if you notice man is made different from the rest of creation man can think man can reason man has free choice man can create things man can invent things man can improve the quality of his life amen but what makes him so different why is he so different from all of creation who made him this way what is man that thou are mindful of him yes amen people look to religions to find the answer amen people they look into science to find the answer they look to philosophers to find the answer but man cannot answer that question that's why it's called the theory of evolution there's only one answer there's only one answer and that answer is found in the one that created man amen yes you've got to go to the source to find the answer of what is man that thou are mindful of him and I ask you we read three passages of scripture that question has never been answered till this day amen hallelujah just like how the only one who can answer the question of what is a woman is a man because man was taken from woman was taken from the side of a man yes Adam gave the woman a identity yes amen what did he say this is born of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she is the feminine part of man that was taken out of man amen amen so this is the question we want to answer amen and the question can only be answered from the word of God Amen so you have to come to the creator of man to find out what is man because God is the one who created man and gave man his identity amen gave man his purpose gave man and put in positionally upon the Earth for a reason amen now you'll never know who you are if Christ is still a mystery to you God can't be a mystery to you because your identity is locked in him unveiling himself amen yes that is why they couldn't fathom who is man that is why Through the Ages they asked what is man we don't get it you've created angels and I you've created all of these things but why have given given your glory to man amen you see outside of knowing god and amen the Salvation through Christ man has no identity people are walking around not having a relationship with Christ they have no identity you ask him where do they go after this life oh I don't know we'll see what happens amen they have no concern amen hallelujah man has no value man has no worked outside of Christ there's no reason for existence and no meaning of life there's no joy outside of Christ how many of you can testify amen there's no peace outside of Christ there's no satisfaction no purpose man finds his Essence man finds his meaning man finds his purpose when he knows Jesus Christ give him a hand clap of Praise glory be to his name amen so we find that man lost his identity through the fall in Eden amen and man has been living with his Amnesia and has forgotten who God created him to be amen Satan has so blinded man and kept the truth hidden from man in fact Satan doesn't want you to get the revelation of who you are amen he knows if you get the true revelation of who you are what you stand for then Satan is powerless before you amen hallelujah because he knows amen hallelujah that power lies in the revelation of who man is amen it's game over for Satan then amen amen Hallelujah he will be stripped of everything that he has stolen from man if man only recognizes who he is amen the kingdom of God the kingdom of man was stolen in Genesis from the man we find after the fall man lost the title deed as ruler over the earth and the title deed went back to the original owner God and what happened Satan exalted himself as God of the earth and now he sits as the God of this evil age yes amen amen hallelujah so man in his Fallen condition why not leave man in his condition because God said his word the day you eat of those frood you shall surely die why not let him continue in that condition of Fallen State why not leave it man was given a choice he chose the of good knowledge of Good and Evil why not just let men live in a fallen State and continue in that condition why have a plan to redeem man what is man that you are mindful of him yes amen hallelujah amen but we thank God for the revelation of the hour amen amen that we are a part of God Amen to deny us is to deny his very own self amen glory be to his name to redeem man is to redeem a part of himself amen Hallelujah to redeem man is to redeem back his original thoughts about man God cannot leave you unredeemed church amen God cannot leave you unredeemed amen hallelujah and in a fallen stage because man in a fallen state has no value there's no substance to that man but man has worth man has Glory man has aen because man is the ultimate form of God's glory on the earth yes glory be to his name amen amen amen I'll say it again man is the ultimate form of God's glory on the earth amen hallelujah amen you say can we share his glory listen what brother brandham says amen we read in the Bible in Romans 8 how we Shar his glory in this hour I want you to listen what brother brandom is saying the glory was stripped at in Genesis at the four but we go here in the in the message the Mighty God unveil before us and you see he saying since Calvary you got my quotes here brother Joshua amen since Calvary we are invited to share his Glory thank you Lord amen Calvary changed it since Calvary we are invited to share his glory amen maybe you thought I I made something up about I Shar God's glory here's the prophet of the age saying since Calvary we are invited to share his glory amen yes 1 Corinthians 12 we are baptized into his body by one Spirit we are all baptized and then we become part of him so what did it the spirit of God Amen now here you know in Romans 8 if you can put it up brother Joshua amen Romans 8:22 praise the Lord how many of you love the word amen the word is our everything amen amen praise the Lord amen maybe put from verse 19 we'll read verse 19 there for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God amen amen yes hallelujah amen yes let me read it again I want you to get it the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen creation is waiting amen hallelujah then we go 22 for we know that the whole creation yes oh I hope you get it this morning all creation granth and trevil it in pain until together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves amen can you feel that groaning amen waiting for the adoption to the Redemption of our body amen amen we got to read Genesis chapter 1 otherwise we'll never see the origin of man maybe it's a question where's origin of man show me quickly Genesis 1:26 amen praise the Lord amen so you know in six days of creation God creates light let there be light creates a firmament amen he creates the Seas and he creates the Sun the moon the star and then he comes down amen he creates fish of the sea birds of the air the beasts of the field he creates everything amen why am I reading this we just read all creation that's right I'm trying to show you all creation yes amen amen praise the Lord all creation granth and travaileth amen and God said let us make man in our image so can you imagine all of creation is watching this God is creating and he's created everything that could be created but now he comes and he says let us make man amen in our image amen what is man amen let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth even if demon powers come creeping upon the Earth you shall have dominion over it yes Lord thank you Lord I have given the authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy amen amen praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah so God created man in his own image Amen in the image of God created he him male and female created he him amen praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah I want you to know that the prophet of God tells us that the feminine Spirit was taken out of man yes but only the body is the byproduct come on sisters I want you to hear this that's right it is only the body that's the byproduct and not your spirit that's right amen hallelujah yes amen this is why I want to lock the sisters in the morning because if you're thinking what is man you are a part of man yes in the beginning you were one Spirit but God took the feminine Spirit out amen if you if you look in the message Oneness there's only one title called Oneness there right Hallelujah I want you to look for the word Spirit there and find that quote where he says only the body was byproduct not the spirit right you find it when I ask you for the quote then you'll Pres present the quote praise the Lord everybody happy Give the Lord a good ank clap of Praise hallelujah amen you see brother Joshua get homework in in at church too hey praise the Lord amen some of you feeling sorry for the devil this morning I don't know why amen we stopping him of every Authority amen amen some you say leave my daddy alone that's not your daddy we come to present your true Daddy to You amen amen thank you Lord amen praise the Lord so we just read there that God put all of creation everything on the earth subject to man but the Bible in Romans 8 is telling us all creation amen all creation means everything that consists in heaven and the Earth because the Bible in Genesis 1 says God created the heavens and the Earth amen so all of Creation in heaven and all of Creation in Earth is waiting oh yes for the manifestation of the sons of God and God has called you to live in this time where Sons and Daughters of God will be manifest on the earth amen hallelujah you are not called you on a party amen you neither are you called you on a picnic you are called you to manifest his glory you are called you to manifest his presence on the earth you are called here to be EV restored in this hour you are called here Amen to fully Express God through your body through your life through your spirit amen give God praise glory be to his name who is all creation the Bible says that God created the heavens and the earth that is all creation amen all of creation the Sun the moon the stars animal life plant life bird life the Beast of the field all their eyes are fixed on you yeah yes the Bible says in verse 19 they are in expectation oh yes if they are in expectation all their eyes are f fixed on you wondering when is man going to come back to his position praise the Lord am waiting for you so what are you you are the central theme of creation come on now if Christ is the central theme throughout all the Bible amen man is a central theme here on the earth because he is God of the earth praise the Lord I pray I'm not the only one excited this morning but I pray you're realizing what is man amen when you truly see what is man I expect everyone of you to be rejoicing Amen to be liberated this morning amen hallelujah man is the central theme of creation man is the ruler of the earth you are the most important part and the most significant part of creation even the angels in heaven they are also created beings and they also waiting for you to come to Perfection yes Amen to come back to your Eden Beauty amen hallelujah you see man is fascinated by Nature man will study flowers botany life plant life they'll study animal life some will dedicate the entire existence to the study of that some will dedicate their study to the planets to the moon the stars but a wise man will say I looked at all of that but the greatest Glory I've seen in man what is man that you are mindful of him amen we don't worship creation some people worship the sun some people worship the moon some people worship the Stars they study the stars amen praise the Lord yes but when we look at it we see there's a greater glory in man amen praise the lord lord so even all of these things that are created all of creation is observing you because they know the value of a Man created in the image and likeness of God God they know the importance of man they are observing you checking you to see if man recognizes who he is they are groaning groaning groaning when will men come back to the original condition yes amen they are groaning when will our leader when will our Master come back and lead us like he did at the beginning yes oh yes praise the Lord you know even the Earth is groaning the Bible says she's putting for birth pains the Earth revil it come on now the Earth is in travail amen groaning putting forth birth pains waiting to renew itself and bring forth A New Earth why why does Earth want to produce a and regenerate and revive the Earth why amen hallelujah Earth itself is putting forth birth pains wanting to bring forth A New Earth because the man that is coming back into his position and the man that is coming back to his authority the restored man cannot rule over a polluted Earth cannot rule over amen earth that is dark and full of chaos a world Amen that is amen gone now what they call it global warming and all of these things so the Earth has got to put forth A New Earth in order to cope with the man that is coming back on the earth amen hallelujah yes when you go into a house amen you buy a new house you've got to renovate the house amen and if you know that God man is coming to live upon your Earth you got to push forth and birth A New Earth so that the God man can live on the earth give God praise amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah so even Earth is getting ready Amen to renovate itself for original sons of God can come back and dwell on the earth I'm asking you are you ready this morning to answer creation's groan and we are groaning also the Bible says amen waiting for the Redemption of our new bodies amen amen so now think of it after God made seraphim and cherubims and Archangels after he created the Beast of the field the fish of the sea the F of the air the plant life animal life they are waiting to see what will God create next yeah so when God says let us make man amen in our own image and after our likeness all of creation were standing at attention to see what type of created being this would be thank you Lord they were waiting for man to step forth the image of God the likeness of God something that looked like God because remember St John amen 5 amen St John four God is a spirit and the spirit of God had moved upon the face of the waters so they had never seen God Amen they felt his presence they saw the effect of his power yes yes but now if I tell you I'm making one in the image and likeness of God that's the closest you're going to see to God Amen so All Eyes Are Fixed On the Earth waiting to see this man that's created in the image and likeness of God oh yes amen come on now oh hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord even the angels in heaven singing Holy Holy Holy but they're looking on the earth they also want to see what is this man coming forth yes wonderful amen than amen amen what a glorious day that must have been for creation amen that is why creation is growing you know if you lose something glorious you'll always gr for it to come back amen like some of us are longing to go back to the days of 21 where there's no aches and pains amen full head of ha straight shoulders amen praise the Lord Brilliance of Youth but it's coming back amen amen hallelujah amen amen hallelujah the great Elohim would create something in his very own image and likeness what is man this is what man is the almighty amen hallelujah now I want you to know something the angels are beautiful the angels are Mighty in fact some are called Mighty Angel amen praise the Lord amen some is called strong Angel the angels are created in magnificent magnificence they are Majestic they are beautiful but you know what the Bible says that the angels are ministering Spirits sent forth to the ears of Salvation yes amen come on now we got to stick with Bible yes amen angels are messengers from God angels carry out the work of the Lord like when he wanted to destroy the Earth with water the angel warmwood step forth amen praise the Lord hallelujah when when Daniel was seeking answer to the vision what happened Gabriel came down yes amen praise the Lord amen the Lord and there's a Waring Angel called Michael amen amen who stands at attention and anytime there's a word that's sent from God to the Earth that gets obstructed by demon forces Michael the Waring Angel steps forth Amen to slay every Giant he this morning if Satan doesn't want the word to penetrate your heart I believe Michael the Archangel he's on his way this morning amen coming to slay that old enemy Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so what are these they serve as messengers of God Amen Hallelujah now think of it the angel there was no other Angel no other being created like Lucifer right outside of God Lucifer glorious being amen that is why Lucifer became jealous when he saw Man created in the image and likeness of God because Lucifer is not made that way yes amen he was boasting about the way he was created he got puffed up he got proud because he was the most beautiful angel created and he thought there was none like him beside God there was nothing else that could match him he was the anointed cherub amen praise the Lord but he did not know that there was when he saw all of creation he didn't mind he saw beast of the field birds of the air fowls he didn't mind he thought look at these beast and these things if he's got a heart he had a heart attack that day when God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness oh yes the devil went into a mountain what is this he didn't know there was one more mystery locked up in the back part of God's mind that was the mystery of God now coming forth through man amen amen let us make man in our image and after our likeness am Angels were not made that way they were made in the image amen hallelujah they were not made in the image and likeness of God Amen so he gets a shock attack when he hears God saying let us make man amen amen hallelujah ajah praise the Lord amen oh I believe this this kind of Revelation ought to make us shout ought to make us rejoice amen ought to give us something to sing about amen because this is a Grace that's been given to partakers of his divine nature yes amen amen amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah now you know when God created the Angels what did he use when God created angels what did he use he used immaterial substance what did he use he use light you get angels of light Cosmic light to make angels of light let's go to Ezekiel 28:1 and see how Lucifer was made and what he was covered with amen praise the Lord amen amen amen oh yes Ezekiel 28 and verse 11 says moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation unto the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus say the Lord God thou seest up the Su full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty now we know this is referring to Lucifer right cuz you'll see the very next sentence thou has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the sardus topel the diamond the barrel Jasper safire emerald kabanle and gold the workmanship of the thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee the day that thou was created see the angels that this Lucifer of beautiful pipes that's why they say you sing like an angel amen Thou Art the anointed sherub that so this is the covering Angel he's the anointed cherub for was I have set thee Soul thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire you see why Satan likes fir walking thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in the amen thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness you see God created him so bright so brilliant so beautiful he got puffed up I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee so to use don't slow down now yeah remember we're building up amen create this Angel God used diamonds he used barrels he used onx Jasper kabanle gold substances to clothe him this was his glory amen that we used to create yeah this Angel but he got jealous because of you yeah amen amen but you are not clothed in in gos thank you Lord and in diamonds amen and this is the heart of message what is man if you don't get you didn't get anything I justed listen to what I'm telling you now what is man that you are mindful of him yes amen so to create the this Lucifer he used all of these things precious stones but to create you he used the material of his own being amen his own substance amen his own Essence he us a piece of himself how else is God going to make something in his image and likeness if he doesn't use the same material come on give God praise what is man than he didn't use gold and diamonds and emeralds no man oh Hallelujah that's not what you are made of but your covering your material your substance your value your world your Splendor is the glory of God Amen the nature of God the character istics of God he created you and he designed you amen with the materials of his very own self glory be to his name amen he did not take from the creation created things to create you some of you have gone into Genesis to I am talking about the original you I'm not talking about man created from the dust of the earth amen I'm talking about God made in the image and likeness of God God went amen and he took substance from his own self he didn't go to the ground to take diamonds and emeralds to create you but God took from his own spirit amen to create a spirit man another amateure God Amen upon the face of the Earth amen you are to give him praise this morning you are to glorify him amen Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord amen oh what is man what is man man created from the substance of God Almighty amen God is not a creator being oh I hope you get a revelation of who you are yes amen hallelujah get a revelation of who you are that your substance is made from the same substance of Elohim yes amen glory thank you the one who is an eternal being took a piece of himself to make Man In His Image and likeness what material will I use to make this man yes God had it all amen at his disposal he could have used any material on the face of the Earth to make this man but he said I will take a piece of myself Amen to make man in my image and likeness I've got to take a piece of myself amen yes amen God created you with his own Glory you see so this glory is that's why Jesus is saying with the glory I had with you at the beginning and the glory thou has given me I have given them this Glory you already existed with the glory in the Eternal thoughts of God so it's nothing new for God to say he'll share his glory with you amen amen it belongs to you yes praise the Lord amen hallelujah the same materials that makes up God he use the same material to create you amen that makes you unique that makes man different amen that's why Lucifer is jealous of you because when he saw man made in the glory of Elohim amen you were reflecting God he was reflecting light amen Hallelujah he was reflecting these stones and these diamonds but you were reflecting God Amen Hallelujah praise the Lord now Man became more glorious than Lucifer then all the Fallen Angels man was the most glorious now not only of creation on the Earth but of Creation in heaven am now you understand the question you made him lower than the Angels but why is he more glorious yeah because of his substance because of the material that's used to make him amen amen hallelujah amen some of you are not getting it amen praise the Lord amen or some of you are not interested in this amen I told you it will reflect this light here will reflect what C gen is within you this morning amen because only Sons and Daughters of God can Rejoice over the truth Amen to realize I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Bram they presented a physical body for me to live but my spirit man amen is made in the substance of God Almighty my spirit man was taken from Elohim amen hallelujah you see now you're not just a masterpiece but you're a peace of the master amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen that is why you cannot fall oh thank you Lord I don't think you heard me that is why you cannot fall thank you Lord how can God fall fall yeah that is why you cannot fall amen hallelujah you are not created in things made with hands you are created like God by the word of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God Amen and you were in the word amen praise the Lord man was a hidden Mystery locked up in the word the bride is the material of Jehovah's nature Essence Jehovah's character yes amen now we are coming to the Capstone revelation of ourselves oh thank you now maybe this quotes will start to make sense to us when she gets a revelation of who she is hallu amen when the bride recognizes who she is what is man that you are mindful of him you come from God and you're going back to God yes amen amen answering the question what is man amen Satan is hiding your identity from you Satan is hiding your identity from you amen what do they do they take the body the flesh they take it to a lab and they say examine this body they strip down the body into chemical value and they find it's worth only 84 cents but they don't know the hidden Mystery locked up in man amen amen only Sons and Daughters of God understand the mystery that they are amen that your soul is wor 10,000 worlds that within the body of 84 sins amen lives an eternal being amen amen created in image and likeness of HOH him somebody shout hallelujah somebody give God praise this morning sons of God shout for Joy praise be to the Living God amen hallelujah amen how can I be concerned about problems of this life when I'm a God of all circumstances amen God had put me the head over every circumstance he had put all things under my my feet we get troubled over silly things Jesus himself says why you worried about these things am amen praise the Lord amen but within man is a hidden Mystery the hidden Mystery is in your soul your soul is what 10,000 world the prophet of God says amen now I know some of you are not rejoicing because show me the quote brother show me the quote amen praise the Lord this is for the unbelievers now let's go to quote number one then he says I think that the people today that are possessed with the spirit capital S right talking about the Holy Spirit or the spirit part of these Angelic beings Spirits which what where did your spirit rotate of your spirit rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven amen amen you see where your spirit comes from you rotated off of God yes praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen let's go to the next quote there not in Mighty God unveil but in who is God Amen paragraph 16 just to detail this very quickly so first now he's giving you now remember I told you your identity can only be found in knowing who God is amen that is why I made the statement at the beginning it was locked up for an end time people because only at the end did God send Revelation 10:7 and what is 107 sent to do reveal the mystery of God so when God the mystery of God is revealed your identity is fully unlocked then the question can be answered what is man that you are mindful of him yes amen amen now let's see the origin of God here first was god Jehovah right let's just draw a picture a drama you can get it coming out of space where there's nothing let's make a little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo so now God is a Halo right and there that was the logos that went out from God at the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us in the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of God right he says now he's talking about man that was talking about God now you what the prophet is saying that man is not coming from from animal life no sir we're not at any senses of animal life God made us that's right then I ever notice then he was here on Earth and he gave him a almet and so forth he he had blessed fellowship with his father speaking and now we're going to make the second the first man you can't see him second man was a hello no no read here read what is man the spirit man did we just read that out of God came the Halo the light so he's saying man was a Halo remember we just read the quote now the spirit rotated off of God right follow now now he takes a third man and he makes him a little white cloud you see why people don't like the big white cloud because they are not a little white cloud I just told you you are made of the same material as the big white cloud yes yes right that's what my entire message was about that we are made of the same substance the same material as God Almighty so if he is the big white cloud oh yes amen we are the little white cloud come on rejoice over the cloud yes now watch what he says here see makes him a little white cloud coming over we can see him Holy Spirit coming down and he's all man that's the soul of man Eternal then amen thank you Lord your soul is called The Little White Cloud Sure amen amen praise the Lord I'm going to go into this to show you how man got redeemed now and after this man sinned he mared that Soul you see he mared the little white cloud yes Blackness Darkness came into it and then God came down and lived in man suffered with man to redeem man and the Holy Spirit Come into man and drives that Blackness and sin away from him and brings him back into perfect Fellowship a part of God that's why he says since Calvary we can share his glory amen yes Lord and now by the way by the blood of Christ who cleanses us from sin we become Sons and Daughters of God Amen yeah what says the one that stood there and rolled Stars off his hands rolled worlds out of his hands and made things which do not appear deity and deity himself lives in the heavens and deity himself lives in man the Creator that made heavens and earth lives in mankind why no wonder cripples when you realize that can straighten out the Creator here amen but the power of your spoken word these signs shall follow them they believe when they lay hands upon the sick they shall recover and when that person recovers you better know the Creator is here on the earth tabernacling Men Thank You Lord amen praise the Lord realize who we you sto short of saying they are realize who we are the Bible says we are Sons and Daughters of God he Offspring then with something like God was Jesus said himself it is written you are Gods amen written in your law we become a part of God a Son of God by adoption through Jesus Christ therefore if you realize that the very God that made the dirt and the Earth and whatever is here is living among men where is your faith at these things that I do when he was here greater shall he do for go to my father whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them that's the Creator speaking then it doesn't doesn't lay in him it lays in heaven where does that creative power lay it doesn't lay in him it lays in us us that's the message who is God Amen praise the Lord out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses amen we got to get another quote so this is in the message the resurrection of Lazarus he said let us plural make man in our plural own image now if God is unseen if the logos logos was in the form just mythical speaking in the form of a Halo then it's supernatural then he had to make man in his own image John 4 says that God is a spirit and he had to make a spirit man and he brought it down now there deity cannot be seen deity is the supernatural amen then he brings it down from a sacred Halo to a little white cloud something that's more visible that's man he gave him the rulership over the kingdom and he governed the Beast like the Holy Spirit leads the church today but there was no man to till the soil then he put man in the image of man on earth created him out of the Dust of the earth and that's where science gets mixed up you see now don't let us get mixed up with the flesh man yeah know who we are yes the inner man amen the spirit man yeah Hallelujah now you know why David is saying my substance was not hid from thee let them dig as many fossils as they want to that doesn't have a thing to do on the bearing of the word of God there he is there yes's this man and now the man sinned and when he sinned he fell that little cloud in there became M and black then the Lost came down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem this man back to the love of the the father and he be and he came in by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and chased sin out of the human and brings man back again in fellowship with God you believe that that's where you are that's what the matter with your Pentecostal people they don't recognize who they are you're Sons and Daughters of God you have in your hand then Jesus said it was quoted one time in the scripture you are Gods he says look deity I'm a part of Charles brandham because I was born from Charlie brandham my daddy I'm a part of him I got a forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small man like him I'm in the nature like him because he's my dad and if we become in spirit sons of God deity dwells in man Hallelujah then you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing's impossible to God God said nothing impossible with you if you believe not with God but you amen amen deities in man the very God that stood back there on the mythical platform of the eternities and rolled worlds of his hand and Creator those things gives you the privilege to be his son you're a part of him God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity there you are it might choke you but study that a little God dwells in man and man becomes a Son of God not him in himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God amen amen yes the Creator lives in the creation oh I think of that then stand in unwavering faith and ask what you will it'll be done there he is God there he is you're tabernacling God Amen Hallelujah praise the Lord aren't you thankful for the message of the hour let's give the Lord a good an of praise for the secret food amen amen hallelujah answering amen the question amen praise the Lord amen the Angels didn't know so
