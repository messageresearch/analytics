Lord a good an clap of Praise amen what a wonderful savior he is amen so we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's the first Sunday of the new year so we amen we are looking forward to what the Lord will do amen how many of you have that expectation in your heart what the Lord will do for us amen hallelujah amen so let's open up our Bibles amen we should carry our Bibles to church am amen it's the new year so let's have new abbots amen we should get to church on time amen carry our Bibles amen be in an attitude of prayer come off now before the service amen we're just rehearsing these things that the prophet laid out for us amen the time of meditation time of prayer and get our souls quietened down before his presence so that he can speak to us by his word amen i' like to speak Amen on expectations visions and declarations for you in 2025 amen you see all of God's promises are yes I gave you a yes amen but the Bible says it's Amen all of God's promises are yes and amen amen so we will speak on expectations visions and declarations for you in 2025 because if we have no Vision where there's no vision the people perish if we have no vision for our life we will not go any further that's how Faith Works if we want to see progress in our life we've got to expect new things amen amen abook chap 2 and verse 2 and the Lord answered me and said write the vision make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it so we've got to write down our own Vision our own plan so that when we read it we can run amen don't worry about other people reading it yes amen we can read it and we can run amen amen so don't let your your planner be filled with nothing for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t so that is God's promise to us now amen things may not happen according to our timeline but wait for it amen amen things are also not continuing as it were God is moving in stages amen Revelation 3 and ver8 praise the Lord behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it amen behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it praise the Lord one more verse of scripture then you can be seated Hallelujah Isaiah 43 and verse 19 it says behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall you not know it you see how the Lord speaks he's declaring something that's a declaration behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth he's already seeing it shall he not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert hallelujah amen you may be seated Hallelujah while we being seated I want to get to Psalms 24:7 amen Psalms 247 is very important because we were in Psalm 24 last year and we said who shall Ascend the heill of the Lord but he that had Clean Hands and a pure heart amen then it spoke about opening up lifting up the gates and opening up the Everlasting doors amen 24/7 says lift up your heads oh he Gates and be lift up ye Everlasting doors so open the door and the king of glory shall come in so if we want to ascend the glory realm we've got to have clean hands and a pure heart and amen and we've got to open up ways for the king of glory to be able to come in amen can you say Amen to that amen and the g and the doors how often must they be open well the very chapter and the verse tells you how often how often 24/7 24 hours 7 Days of the Week the doors of Jerusalem Mount Zion ought to be opened the Gates of Jerusalem Mount Zion ought to be open so that the king of glory can come down amen amen so that's an easy scripture to to remember Psalm 247 that's how God must have access to my life praise the Lord and we were reading there that in Revelation 4 and 1 and after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show the things which must be Hereafter now pay attention because brother brandham is saying revelation four is the rapture of the church so which means that it it is doors being open to us and and we'll read in this first quote here brother brandham is saying that the Rapture we're talking about is only for the bride so which means that the door was opened only for the bride but we know the Rapture is not just one event the prophet defined it for us and he told us it's a process it's a shout so which means that the Rapture is opening up in Dimensions to us can you say Amen am hallelujah amen different doors of the Rapture will be opened he says there is going to be a Rapture the Bible says there will be and it will only and it'll be only for the elected the elected lady the bride in this day that's pulled out the church amen praise the Lord now that is beautiful amen that this Rapture the shout our party is only for the bride amen amen pay attention now we're going to get through this now amen so Matthew 25:10 we read this as well while they went to buy the bridegroom came how did he come somebody say with a shout yes and then did he open the door he had to open the door because the very next verse says and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut amen hallelujah so the bridegroom came opened up the door of the Seven Seals amen he opened up a new land to the Bride of Jesus Christ where all things are possible amen amen making things ready for the Mark 11:23 men to come in on the scene making things ready for the Romans 8 men to come in on the scene amen now the promise is not just left with God Alone he has opened it up to us but it requires an application on our part what will we do with the word amen amen now here we're going to detail this just a bit he says when the bridegroom came he opened the door he pulled the bride in and he shut the door yes sir right everyone get that point now in the message proving his word he says it's now how did he do it we want to learn how he did it right this is what the point of it it son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us that's how he's going to do it and will make his word so real till it'll unite the church and him as one so what happened when he pulled her in to the door there was an invisible Union am amen hallelujah amen see It'll unite the church and him as one the bride but how did it happen don't miss the first part it's through the son of man through God in human flesh yes through God in William brandham can I make it more plain than that amen he pulled us into the door amen now watch it's in two steps there pulled her in United the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper so he pulled her into the wedding to the Mar he pulled into the marriage now we're waiting to go to the supper everybody clear with that she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage cuz the marriage happens now amen so brother BR is very clear here she's already united we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage amen cuz the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen now there's a there's a verse here I want to read in Psalm 24:14 amen praise the Lord everybody feeling good amen amen Psalm 24:14 we said he opens the door and he pulls it in watch what Psalm 24 sorry 25:14 says there's a private place reserved for the lovers of God so he opens the door he pulls you into that secret place remember we adding to Psalm 27 in the secret of his Tabernacle will he hide me but he already started it now he's pull you into a private place amen where they sit near him and receive the Revelation secrets of his promises amen hallelujah the mystery of God has been revealed the mind of Christ has been revealed the Revelation Secrets has been revealed to us how he opened the door and pulled us into the secret place yes amen amen hallelujah then remember we tying all of these scriptures you got to pay attention to this Genesis 25 and verse 5 watch it's in the 25th verse sorry the 25th chapter and how many years did Abraham wait for the promise 25 years so though the vision t wait for it it must come to pass Super Church super race Invincible Army thr the vision ter wait for it it must come to pass us amen amen amen and Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac Hallelujah that's the Dimensional Doors I'm talking about now amen he's giving all to the bride amen God don't work with two Ministries at the same time hallelujah amen you you'll see now as we continue in 25:6 you see he gave all that he had unto Isaac he gave him everything he gave the bride everything but watch the next verse and Unto the Sons of the con concubines which Abraham had Abraham gave gifts they are satisfied with the gifts amen and what he did he sent them away he closed the door to any further blessing come on somebody praise the Lord he closes the door to any further blessing he gives them gifts and sends them away amen but watch now it's not over for Isaac yet and from Isaac his son he sent them away from who you see why there's a separation between the bride and denominations he sent them away from Isaac his son you see why they are leaving the message he sent them away from Isaac his son you see why they are saying they don't believe the sign he sent them away from Isaac amen wonderful while he yet looked Eastward unto a East Country now in verse 11 it says and it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed his son Isaac after the death after the death of Moses Joshua could get into the promised land amen hallelujah after the son of man was revealed through William Brandon can Revelation 108 to11 come in on the scene amen God don't work with two people at the same time amen so it's after the death of Abraham that God blessed his son Isaac amen and Isaac dwelt by The Well of La orai if you only knew what the well of La orai means that word means a living well amen that well is typing Jesus Christ the inexhaustible Fountain of Life so Isaac is dwelling by the inexhaustable Fountain of Life now maybe some of you are thinking he you sound like a uh like you're saying every year there's new promises you're going through Psalm 23 you're showing us the angel of the Lord leading the church you're going to Psalm 24 you're showing us who shall ascend the hill of the Lord he that had Clean Hands and a pure heart and the glory realm amen the bride living in that Glory realm the sh of Glory coming down upon the believer amen you mean every year there's something new amen you mean every year there's something new well can I let that Prophet answer it for you let's get to the message Shalom it says God stands on the promised word for each new year amen so somebody needs to the mind of Christ for the promises of God for each new year come on now this is our Prophet speaking God don't stand on the promised for last year or the year before God stands on the promised word for each new year amen he stands on it this year to fulfill what he promised what he has got promised for this year yesterday's blessings was good last year's anointing was good but I want the pro promises for this year they are new Every Morning H amen he says whatever it is right whatever it is I want to be right in the center of his will in the future like they did amen amen now he types Abraham what were we talking about like Abraham when he met his Crossroads he didn't know how he would do it God told him I'm going to give you a son 25 years he waited for it every 2,000 years God does something on the earth amen 25 years we have waited for it amen amen finally the Sun come and God said now by this sun I'm going to make you a father of many nations amen take him up there and kill him destroy the very thing he had waited 25 years on Abraham never worried it never bothered him he picked up the wood and put it on a donkey and took his son took him on the top of the hill to offer him because Abraham knew he received him as one from the dead Sarah's whom was dead he was sterile he was 100 years old she was 90 so he come by the promised word if God told him to offer him up God was able to raise him up amen hallelujah he says we must believe God the same way God is able to raise up the promises for our day how many of you believe that amen God is able to raise up the promises for our day amen we may seem dead amen some of the promises May him dead the bride will be a super chur super rais but it's a promise amen amen it's a promise yes Hallelujah she'll be an invincible Army but I'm holding on to the promises of God Amen I may not see it amen this is not the prophet now this is my notes if you were just wondering amen I may not see it but I have the evidence of the promised land who brought it Joshua and Caleb brought back the evidence of the land who is Joshua the prophet who is Caleb the one that stayed faithful to the prophet's message now here what the prophet also says in Shalom so the new year is determined by God somebody tell your neighbor 2025 is determined by God 202 and nobody can stop it no are you reading it what the prophet is saying the new year is determined by God not by us the new year is determined by God right just determine now all we can do is stay in his word amen amen hallelujah amen and how many of you are determined to stay with the word amen amen amen praise the Lord and I was thinking about it I am more determined now more than ever before that mes Corporation or motus group is not going to use me more in the Kingdom of the world than God is going to use me in the Kingdom of Heaven am I will not give my spiritual resources to nothingness my energy and my strength to just earning a few rents amen hallelujah I am not going to devote much of my time and effort and energy more on the Natural Things of life more than the kingdom of God priorities have to change amen it has to shift we can't expect new things of God now we can't expect the blessings or or the results of blessings of God without the sacrifice for it we want all the the spiritual rewards of Christ but we want to give him the least we want to give Christ the least and expect the best results the best rewards it don't work that way amen so I'm determined more than ever before that this year we're going to work more in the kingdom of God than in the corporate world Amen or can somebody amen identify with that word am we are not going to give ourselves to pharaoh we were born for a purpose amen amen I will not become a slave to my job amen I be used more in the corporate world than in the kingdom of God this amen thy will what did Jesus say thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth this earth now can we say that about ourselves I will not put more effort in my schooling than the kingdom of God come on young people so dedicated to our schooling so dedicated to our studies but yet when it comes to the things of God we ask you to read the scripture they ask you to read s you come over there in the front good morning class good morning ma'am you even go the day before and you practice before the mirror how you going to read but when it comes to the things of God I'm so shy no change is now right amen amen who can change it you Hallelujah more effort in the schooling than for things of God more effort in studies University than for things of God come on I'm challenging somebody now amen I will not put more effort into my work than for the Lord because who gives us our strength of life doesn't the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness then all of these things shall be added unto us didn't Jesus say that our righteousness must exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees didn't Jesus say that then that means more must be done for the kingdom of God than for the corporate world not many amens on that Hallelujah now remember I'm saying don't become a corporate slave don't become an academic slave don't become amen a slave to to things of this life Hallelujah I'm not saying don't study for an Earthly job I'm saying put the same Zeal or more Zeal more energy for the things of God study if you must but put more energy for the things of God work if you must but put more G zeal and energy for the things of God I wish I had somebody who could say Amen to that word study for your Earthly degree but study the word of God Amen come on now amen hallelujah we must study amen study of the word must supersede must supersede study of natural things because after all we claim to be supersede soorry got to supersede praise the Lord so I'm not saying don't work you must work praise the Lord amen a man's responsibility is to work and provide for his family but work for Jesus in his kingdom too amen yes Hallelujah don't let it be that we now 10 15 20 30 40 50 years coming to church but we never worked a day in the kingdom of God or never did a single thing in the kingdom of God oh Jesus is looking for and read Matthew 25 after talking about the virgins go see what he says he's looking for stewards who can manage don't mismanage the word that's been re released to us amen praise the lord we should also be a witness share our testimony tell people about the love of Jesus Christ tell them about the end time message we are called to prophesy again amen share your testimony Amen on the way back home there on New Year's Eve New Year's Day amen we were going home and sister J were sharing her testimony powerful amen what God can do amen and it revives you when you hear these testimonies to see the Saving Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ come from a Hindu home amen come from a world Amen of religions amen serving other gods but God revealed the end time truth amen hallelujah am what is that the gene seed of God being quickened amen so we can share these testimonies and rejoice around these things and say see what the Lord Has Done won't you see what the Lord Has Done amen amen praise the lord we must build ourselves up spiritually if we want the blessings of God blessings are not going to come without spiritual growth hallelujah amen now you don't want to be compared now with this uh har Krishna movement you don't want to be compared with the Muslims because this place blings exceed that do you want the gifts or you want he gave all to Isaac what do you want because why I'm going down there you some people say but but the the Hindu man is blessed without our Christian religion the Muslim man is blessed without a Christian religion they have gifts I am saying God will open up new doors for you hallelujah amen some of you are looking for promotion some of you are looking for new things in your life but I tell you God can do exceedingly abundantly maybe you're looking for management position God can make you a business owner hey you know when I start declaring things brother Joshua ask brother Joshua he'll tell you some of you are looking for financing maybe you're asking God lord I need rent money you'll always have rent money yes how about you ask God for your own house amen amen how about you ask God Amen the god is able to provide the rent money he's able to provide you to take on a mortgage Hallelujah you and for those who can receive it now God will bless you super exceeding abundantly that you won't even need a mortgage that will come press down shake it together and run it over that you can buy as you please you see Abraham when he wanted to buy that piece of land he didn't go to the bank first Hallelujah God blessed him exceedingly abundantly that he paid for Sarah's grave Hallelujah oh I'm glad only two received that now don't get stuck into the old way of thinking because when God opens up to the bride Hallelujah he is not restricted Hallelujah he opens up abundantly there should be nothing lacking in the bride so I'm speaking amen new blessings over you amen I am speaking a word over you amen but you've got to receive it thank you Lord amen and I say I'm breaking classes over your life I'm breaking all ways of thinking I am breaking amen the old way of things going on in your life amen and what you have determined for your life God will supersede it but it comes with laws and principles amen I'm declaring and speaking new things over your life I'm speaking Genesis 22 and 17 over your life God won't call you look look at this 22:17 in blessing I Will Bless thee how will you bless me Lord in multiplying I will multiply thee God's not going to call you and make you a father of many nations and then you can't take care of the many nations you know you get these people make babies everywhere they can't take care of them the mother must go collect maintenance God doesn't want you to collect maintenance come on now amen God doesn't want you to collect maintenance thank you you know people get nervous when you speak like this thank you Lord I am showing you my God who told Abraham this and are we the children of Abraham did he say that I will bless your seed are we Abraham sure come on we sing Abraham's blessings are mine Hallelujah Abraham's blessings are mine God didn't call Abraham to live in poverty that's right amen God blessed him abundantly look fact that was one of God's promises for his life and Abraham didn't have to wait 25 years for that God blessed him amen hallelujah he waited for the son 25 years but when he came to his material blessings when he came to his financial blessings God blessed him abundantly amen yes some people don't like this kind of preaching but I'm preaching the word anyway Amen in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thee thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemies amen these are the same Gates amen that Jesus told Peter the Gates of Hell will not Prevail amen so when God blesses he multiplies he has no sorrow but how does God bless you may ask how does God bless is there anything required on my part we have to work with laws and principles I can't bypass procedures for you here let's go to Luke 638 there you'll see how you want me to be blessed Lord how you going to give me back he says give amen if you're okay is for amen maybe we can try it here let's try it here because I don't know if it's the cable or if it's this we can read it off here hallelujah Luke 6:38 somebody write this down it says give what's the first word tell your neighbor give every I want you to give up amen praise the Lord let me see if I can get into reading mode if you can see that so Luke 6:38 says give amen did you tell your neighbor to give and what did they say stingy now if the one who said let there be is telling you to give you see we can't expect the blessing without the first part amen give and it shall be given unto you straight away he's telling I'll give unto you how good measure press down see he's not going to Peck the bag he's going to tie those things down tight press down good measure amen shaken together and running over there shall be an overflow shall men give where is it coming from don't stay in your room and expect the windows of Heaven to open who's going to give it to you so you must work and God is going to cause those men to give it to you oh come on somebody's reading the Bible with me H bro I thought you said I have to stay in my room and pray and somebody's going to knock on my door and come and say there's a suitcase full of uh I thought they going to knock on my door and come give me the car key you got to work and God will bless the labors of your hands amen shall who give to you okay who did you God use to bless Abraham and give him cattle and give him things use men right that's the point I'm trying to say God used men to bless Abraham praise the Lord shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again now don't lose track of that definition and what he's saying there I want another version so you can understand it it says give generously and generous gifts will be given back to you shaken down to make room for more abundant gifts will pour out upon you with such an overflowing measure that it will run over the top is that overflow amen amen now this is the last part I said don't miss the translation your measurement of generosity becomes your measurement of return amen amen hallelujah amen your measurement of generosity becomes your measure of return amen amen hallelujah so how do we do it brother Bram says your book for the new year must be the Bible must be the words of God see just make it live to what's promised what it's promised to live for and every coming year to come you see things are going to increase we're going to get into high dimensions of the Holy Ghost what is the prophet saying here just make it live to what's promised to live for so the promises for this year we want to make live and then he says and every coming year to come every year that's been that has been he is the Eternal God living through the Eternal Word that he spoke where when every Bible truth and every promise in it has been Vindicated as it's been down through the years amen hallelujah amen hallelujah how many of you are rejoicing amen with the word amen is true amen hallelujah thank you Lord praise the Lord amen he says New Year what about it some of you are thinking New Year what about it new year brings New Hope amen we're one year closer we're one day closer than we was yesterday we don't look back amen don't tell everyone things didn't work out for me last year don't look back Hallelujah I'm telling telling you don't be like Lot's wife and look back amen don't tell everyone how things didn't work out for you Hallelujah we don't look back we look forward New Year doesn't mean turning a new page so what does New Year mean brother Brandon not turning new page it's turned to the word see what the word promises for today see what the light of this day supposed to be and I am telling you that new doors are going to open for the bride amen amen Dimensional Doors are being open as well if you only knew our Dimensions work we ought what we ought to do this year is not go back to Creeds and things get back to our old denominations not go back to Old denominations but turn to the word see what kind of a light is supposed to shine today amen I say Amen to that amen hallelujah how are you going to know what kind of a light is going to shine today if you are not connected to the angel of God via the fivefold am otherwise people will still be preaching the same old things to you praise the Lord you know there's a lie there's a lie that I don't need to connect with the fivefold I caned home and listen to the tapes it's the same lie same lying demon that says I don't need to go to church to serve the Lord I many if you heard people say that I don't need to go to the house of the Lord to worship it's the same people that lying that will say I don't need to pray God knows my heart it continues it's just a continual lie yeah the one that's telling you I don't need to go to church to pray I'm praying him house he's lying he's not praying in his house we've got to see what kind of light is supposed to shine today changing the page or changing calendars doesn't change time a lot of people say well the oldest God throw the old December calendar now put up a new one New Year that's what New Year means to them to me I want to see what's promised for the day I want to know what the light of the hour is so I can know how to walk in it I want to know where I'm living what age I'm in how far up the road am I how you going to do it new things are being declared amen praise the Lord amen oh Hallelujah isn't he Worthy amen amen new things have been declared for us amen amen I'm expecting new things how many of you expecting new things amen amen we can't do the same old things and expect new things which means we must make a spiritual investment praise the Lord [Music] amen how do we do it brother brandom if you want to remember the old here what he says are you feeling right up to it to start the New Year now go right out in the New Year we want to start it off right serving the lord amen how many got up this morning and thanked him for the old year amen you see how what he saying you thank him for what he did last year you thank him that we could Ascend the glory realm amen what it meant and asked amen what we did at the bedside when we got up then come to the table where we usually a little family altar gather around the table and pray you see we've got to develop good spiritual habits read our Bible now there's no excuse why we should not read our Bible and everybody said amen if we call ourselves the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ that are feeding on the word there's no reason why we should not read our Bibles amen amen in fact there you have technology in your hands if you go to the Play Store or the Apple Store you can go and read the oneyear Bible amen amen you can set up a reading plan every day it'll give you chapters to read you can follow that and by the 31st of December you would have read the whole Bible amen praise the Lord but you see it requires spiritual discipline that's what it requires spiritual discipline now we always try to make a Abbot we try to make it what a of praying a night before we go to bed since I was converted get up of a morning it's too dark too Misty for me to walk I don't know where I'm going but if I just ask him to take my hand and guide me through the day so make it a habit to pray am come on now you're not listening to me some of you are ignoring me tell your neighbor make it a to pray we see many of us are rejoicing when we say God's going to bless you God's going to give but when he telling you how he's going to do it people are quiet because they don't want to get through the spiritual discipline of it praise the Lord amen so maybe you're saying I I haven't connected in 2023 with the angel of God maybe you're saying I haven't ascended the hill of the Lord I haven't ascended the glory realm I don't have clean hands and a pure heart maybe you're saying amen that amen you're talking about amen Dimensional Doors being opened up Heaven coming down upon the Earth the bride being taken into to that secret place mysteries of God revealed to her Power released to the church amen Dimensional Doors I'm talking about Dimensional Doors amen amen meaning that even right now God can open you up dimensionally thank you Jesus amen hallelujah maybe you're thinking what I'm talking about what am I talking about God when God opens up new promise to you he's taking you to higher Dimensions amen so which means that some things were close to you but it's for a time in a season I just want you to get you what dimensions are he says remember we live in three dimensions light time and [Music] matter amen praise the Lord what what time did I start at 9 amen praise the Lord I'm losing track of time here because we keep changing the service times amen praise the lord we live in three dimensions now how many of you are conscious conscious of these three dimension when I'm saying how many of you know that you are physically contacting the dimension of time or the dimension of matter or the dimension of light it becomes so natural to you praise the Lord amen we live in a three dimensions like time matter and our five senses contact these Dimensions our sight context light you see what brother brand is giving you the key now sight context light feelings context matter and so forth but we have to but we have contact through science to the fourth dimension now so we never had that Dimension before how is he saying we got it through science prior to this we knew that the prophets could see visions that was God's Communication channel with these prophets and only they were blessed with this communication portal the fourth dimension but now he says through science we have the fourth dimension because coming through this building comes picture voices of radio pictures of Television that our Sensers do not contact but yet the tube or Crystal picks up ether waves and manifest them right in this building now is live actions of people in the air live voices they hear we know it they absolutely the truth and the only thing you do they catch it on I understand the mechanics of those things science has invented but we know that it proves that there is a fourth dimension I'm trying to show you the dimensions that exist that we never knew about before but now that this Dimension has been opened up to us we can enjoy the benefits of iten he says The Fifth Dimension is where the sinner the unbeliever dies The Fifth Dimension kind of well a horrible Dimension and when a Christian dies he goes into the sixth Dimension and God is in the seventh Dimension praise the Lord what we need is a holy ghost atmosphere an atmosphere where the power of God is moving one Accord one place gathered together under the atmosphere of expecting God to move down and do signs and wonders let's move oursel up into that bracket Hallelujah so he's saying there has to be a conscious decision where we move into the dimension of the Holy Ghost amen Step Up in faith move out of these three dimensions up into the next one am the Holy Ghost is a four-dimensional amen so we become four-dimensional beings praise the Lord not just living by light time and matter but living by the Holy Ghost amen Lord I just believe you're going to pour your blessings I'm expecting it now you see how we are to talk I believe you're going to pour out your blessings somebody say I believe you're going to pour out your blessings I'm expecting it now all things are moving right in I'm expecting to see exceedingly abundantly now amen hey I thought this word would excite somebody amen you come down and say well I don't know about it well you Earth the other person you're sitting by one of them you say oh Lord just te down I'm expecting great things so I'm telling you don't come to tear me down if you have no expectation for your life don't come to tear me down what did Brother BR say don't come to tear me down I'm expecting great things are you expecting great things and that expect he will get that Unity among the people I also want to say if God closed doors in your life make sure you go there and nail it closed that those persons who chose to walk out of your life can never come in Hallelujah why should they enjoy the benefits of a Son of God yes amen nail it sh amen praise the Lord Brother BR talking about Dimensions now he says five senses we live in that's just a little world of our own now I'm trying to show you something here that animal life plant life don't know the world that humans live in we live in a world of our own they can't comprehend our world because we are the highest form everybody's understanding me even though they exist in the world dimensionally they are not of the same caliber as us I'm trying to show you spiritually even though we exist in the world with other people dimensionally we don't exist in the same plane as them we live in a world of our own we are seated together in Heavenly places in Jesus Christ you see there is senses beyond that another Dimensions God is always present if we could only remember that you see now he's going to open up Dimensions to us he says the angels of the Lord are encamped around them that fear Him a dimension but can you see it but it's there the scripture is telling you that the angels of God are encamps around you amen so it's a dimension that's there in this building tonight stands Jesus Christ in this building tonight is a host of angels thousands of them gathered around you don't see them but you can feel the influence of them telling you that they're here if that isn't so then scripture isn't so and if the scripture isn't right then God isn't right the Bible says the angel of God encamped they don't leave they stay near to those that fear Him Jesus said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in their midst that makes him in a world that we cannot see that our senses don't contact Jesus Christ is here present if we could be conscious to that trying to show you there are dimensions that exist in us around us come on church that we've got to tap into and these Dimensional Doors can open up to us he says not only here but when you're walking down the street wherever you are you that profess to be Believers and fear the lord remembers the angels of God are moving with you wherever you are when I go to work work the angels of God are moving with me when I go to school the angels of God are moving with me amen wherever I go through the fire the angels of God are moving with me through the trial the angels of God are with me amen hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Lord what must we do now he says they watch everything you do every thought that goes through your mind they know all about you therefore we must be conscious of that if you're not conscious of it then you act any way so people mostly today too many people are not conscious of the presence of the Lord Jesus that's the reason they or we have these things that we have going on right now that's not right listen what brother brand is saying now this what you see happen here in the meeting that spirit that comes and packs out into Dimension that the world knows nothing about amen you sitting in the audience will just see brother Brandon there as a normal man talking you'll think it's just a prophetic gift but he's saying what is happening is the the holy spirit is coming and packing him into another dimension yeah he'll define it if you only knew my dear sister you're standing at the same place so there's a sister standing there you're aware as a Believer right now something's going on I turned around this way and started talking real sweet humble feeling come amen cuz between you and I probably never seen the picture of it that light is just Milling between you and I amen I'd like to believe that light is here right now Milling between you and I you see maybe you're just in the three dimensions see you're sitting there there's another dimension here but maybe you're just sitting there in the three dimensions now this is another dimension it's moving in on me but it's a spirit in it's in another world people they're not gone they're near us angels and everything else angels of God and camp around them that fear Him you remember Elisha and Doan that morning the Syrian armies there's more with us than there is with them he couldn't see anybody but Elisha said God open them young man's eyes and when he opened his eyes around that old Prophet was angels of fire and Chariots of Fire then there's more with us than there's with them and that's the dimension Now by being born again maybe you never will see such but you believe it anyhow how much greater is the reward who have never seen yet believe but some of us were born for that God places that in the church from baby birth prophets are not just put in by man it's a gift born all through scripture born from childhood watch how he says this now if the audience can still hear me he doesn't even know if the audience is hearing him because he's caught up in this Dimension if the audience can still hear me the angel of the Lord is settling and I know that I'm being heard somewhere but she's suffering what I think is a broken rib she's got a lump see I'm just trying to show you that you walking in this world you are caught up in another dimension and God are going to open up more Dimensions to you amen I said God is going to open up more Dimensions to you amen amen praise the Lord I got much more go amen hallelujah yeah I just want to maybe read this in glorify Jesus he says the first thing he's talking about going up another dimension now he says going this way the first thing is the spirit of a man catch this now the spirit of the man he's talking about Jesus Christ the spirit of a man that died and rose again Christ the Holy Spirit that's what influences the believer going upward the next is Angelic beings the next is heaven the third heaven you see what happens out of your three dimensions next is the Holy Ghost amen he says after that is angels I thought you wanted new things to be declared over you I thought you wanted Dimensional Doors to be opened to you so I'm saying if you never got it in 2024 if you never got it in 2023 write the vision though it t wait for for it sometimes it was not meant for you to receive it as fast as others sometimes it is still the same vision continuing so don't throw away what you wrote down last year hello don't throw away what you wrote down last year if it wasn't time and season wait for it God will bring you to passen but be like Abraham and believe it amen be like Abraham and believe for the promise to come to pass amen hallelujah I know I know sometimes in life we get despondent when things don't go our way I know sometimes you can break your spirit but be a ragged Christian Hallelujah say Lord if things never happened for me the way I wanted it last year this year I'm believing for it amen thank you Lord I'm speaking new things now speak the month and season you want it to happen amen speak it amen over your life speak exactly the detail because God is a very specific God tell God the details of what you want amen don't just ask God Amen for an increase because if you get 100 increase God gave you an increase speak what you want speak the desire of your heart the Bible says ask and it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open to you cuz everyone that knocketh the door is open everyone that ask the lord giveth yes and everyone that seeketh will find I'm also saying that God is going to teach you how to manage money some people have been mismanaging money that's why you're in the problem you are even Jesus said before you start a project consider the cost and see if you have enough he says otherwise the unbeliever will say look at this person claiming to be a Christian they can't even live so live within your means and ask God to bless you remember 638 now Luke 638 he's promised give and it shall come back to you hallelujah praise the Lord so you got to be faithful you got to be faithful and you saying how you giving doesn't the the Bible says that in tithes and in offerings amen you're giving to the Lord am and God is going to use that same to give back to you amen amen I'm also saying that God is going to tell you not to mismanage your finances amen and not to take unnecessary debt and to you become as wise as Joseph you are going to know how to handle money as wise of Joseph somebody receive that word if you've mismanaged finances in the past if you've mismanaged relationships if you haven't been working with a budget God is going to teach you how to work with that because out of your own wisdom that God is going to give you God is going to bring the Breakthrough and you're going to say see what the Lord has done hallelujah can't you see what the Lord has done the things I've waited for has come to pass see what the Lord Has Done amen God is going to teach you how to manage relationships hallelujah amen God is going to teach you how to manage relationships amen if you've mismanaged relationships God is going to teach you and open up the door of how to manage relationships God is going to teach you how to manage love God is going to teach you how to manage Faith amen amen God is going to teach you how to manage his word you're going to become a good Steward of his word yes how God's opening the doors because sometimes through the lack of teaching or maybe you're just used to the old ways of how things are running in your family but God will open new doors and teach you new things and I say God expand your vision God expand amen the possibilities of what can happen in your life he says you've got to believe God for new things if you want new things to happen you've got to believe God for new things Mary had to believe for the impossible I say believe for the impossible over your life the key seek the kingdom spiritual growth then all these things will follow I want to end right here right now because amen I want to pray

presence of mine enemies Hallelujah the Bible says call for the Elders of the church let them anoint you with oil anointing signifies the Holy Ghost so I am praying even as we anoint you the Holy
