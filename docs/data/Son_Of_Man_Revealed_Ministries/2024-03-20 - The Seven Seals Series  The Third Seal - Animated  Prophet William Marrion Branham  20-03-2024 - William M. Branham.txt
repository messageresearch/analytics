TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we have come again tonight Lord to attempt uh this meeting and to pray thee to open to us Lord this uh third seal of this book that it might be uh known to us that we would know what to do and how to live and how to be better Christians now tonight we're going to read uh from this blessed old word again in the sixth chapter and we start tonight with the third seal and that is the fifth verse the fifth and sixth verse now in the fifth verse and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come see and I beheld in LW a black horse and he that said on him had a pair of bces in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast saying a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny but see thou hurt not the oil and wine and there was no man in heaven no man on Earth no man beneath the Earth or nobody was even worthy to look at the book see now just think of that then the lamb comes forward and he takes the book now John was asked not to weep anymore he said behold the line of Judah has prevailed and and he can take the book and open it so he turned to look for a Lon and he saw a lamb the Elder called said a Lon has prevailed but when he come and looked it was a lamb coming out from the throne for he was bleeding for the people intercessing for the people until the last soul that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundational world come in there just going to be so many of them there and that's it that's all the others won't even want to come in have no desire to come in and so then when that last Soul comes in then the time of redemption is finished then the lamb comes forth to claim his rights to what he has redeemed and that's all creation then he said he is worthy to take the book of redemption now it doesn't belong back to the judge anymore belongs to the Redeemer and he's done done the work of redemption down comes Christ you seen in the 10th chapter of Revelations this rer let's this discuss him if you notice the first writer who he was and we found out last night scripturally that the second rider was exactly the same man only he on another heart what happened he changed his ministry see right we found out he was an antichrist and it changed his position now watch where we're at tonight that other Church AGS now we're coming down to the Third Church age now just that Zach the Third Church age is this Zac was third horse this riter is a same one but another stage of his ministry now John sees him on a black horse he changed something else he has started riding him in the time of the Dark Ages that's what the dark harsh repres in it the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the True Believers amen that was left his balances are his scales in his hand you see calling out measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see actually that is wheat and barley is natural staff of life that's what bread and stuff's made from but you see he was charging for this yeah what it means that he was charging his subjects for the kind of the hope of life that he was sending out to them by making he started in that very time of making them pay for prayers charging for prayer they still do it no venience because what was doing capturing the wealth of the world the scale weighing out measure of wheat or a penny three measures of barley for a penny the rider on a black horse see he was making stripping his subjects of their money when the Bible predicts that he holds about the wealth of the world now notice you see where that old money taken in church comes from away to build an organization a big something million dollar here charging for Prayer by the priest to pray people out of purgatory charging I'm taking this right out of the history charging for I guess it's novenia I guess everybody noia I guess that's something you have to do you know some penants somebody at to charge for that notice here's a good part now notice see that thou hurt not this wine all just a little bit of it left but don't you touch that now oral is symbolizes the spirit the Holy Spirit I'll give you a few verses if you want to through scriptures Leviticus 8:12 where Aaron before he went had to be Anointed with all you know and and Zechariah 4 12 of oil coming pouring through the pipes and said this is my spirit oil and another thing if you want to see Matthew 14:25 there was a foolish virgin 253 the foolish virgin had no ARL no spirit and Matthew 254 the wise virgin had or in her land Spirit now or typifies spirit and wine symbolizes stimul ation of Revelation oh I like to run all over the place want didn't wake up the neighborhood when the Lord show me that stimulation of Revelation oil and wine in the Bible is associated together always I got the concordians look the streak of that like like that where wine and oil goes together all of night see because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that he makes him behave himself [Music] unnormal Hall see that's what's matter with him now then what does it say to this Rider in Black don't you hurt my wine and my oil don't you touch it my y or I've got just a little bit of it down there but he's still a little bit [Music] there now you can go on through and measure out all that kind of Life at you're putting out that up to you you're going to pay for it down there but when you come across that wine or you leave it alone now listen here and I and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast what was it the [Music] [Applause] [Music] lamb what's the four Beast the lamb said it wow go take his own that belongs to him amen don't you touch that or I sir not the four beast but the lamb was the one that said it oh my amen the lamb not the four Beast didn't announce this the lamb said itself well to the best of my understanding and the best of that I know I and with all that I believe in my heart that's the true me meaning of those three seals I want to thank God for it I'll say this that it's a revelation that he gave me he gave that to me the revelation of and I do believe that we're living in the last days he's the [Music] word wonderful
