[32:09] hallelujah
[32:10] bless the Lord
[32:12] amen so let's turn to Genesis Chapter 18
[32:15] amen for a title I want to speak on
[32:18] we're still dealing with Abraham's
[32:19] Journey of Faith
[32:21] but I want to bring it to this I have
[32:23] creative power
[32:25] the PowerPoint is open
[32:28] amen hallelujah
[32:30] I have creative power in me now amen
[32:37] not tomorrow yes I'm not waiting for it
[32:41] I have creative power in me now
[32:46] amen amen did he say the word is in the
[32:48] bride yes
[32:49] amen hallelujah as it was in Mary so
[32:52] let's turn to Genesis 18. we're only
[32:54] going to be dealing with the first 15
[32:55] verses because we're only dealing with
[32:58] Abraham and Sarah's portion
[33:00] the next portion goes down to Sodom or
[33:03] the negotiation amen the intercessory
[33:06] role that Abraham is playing there but
[33:08] we're not focusing with on that this
[33:09] morning because Genesis 18 is packed
[33:12] amen and you know how the prophet will
[33:14] take Luke 17 30 and you're tying all of
[33:17] the scriptures amen so we don't we don't
[33:19] want to focus too much on that we want
[33:21] to focus on this first part of Genesis
[33:23] 18 from 1 to 15.
[33:26] amen
[33:29] and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[33:32] plains of memory and he sat in the tenth
[33:35] Door In the Heat of the day
[33:38] so he's sitting outside the tent he's
[33:40] sitting by the tent door amen who's in
[33:43] the tent
[33:46] Sarah is in the tent
[33:48] Amen to the prophet have attained vision
[33:50] amen hallelujah and the Lord appeared
[33:54] unto him in the plains of memory and he
[33:57] sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the
[33:59] day
[34:00] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[34:02] low three men stood by him
[34:05] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[34:08] from the tent door
[34:10] and bowed himself toward the ground
[34:13] and said my Lord amen
[34:16] so the mystery of God is already
[34:17] revealed to him amen he had met
[34:19] Melchizedek yes
[34:21] so that was Melchizedek in theophany so
[34:23] he had soy it come from Spirit to word
[34:25] to flesh now amen so remember these are
[34:28] all types and shadows of our Lord Jesus
[34:30] Christ amen my Lord if now I have found
[34:33] favor in thy side pass not away I pray
[34:36] thee from thy servant let a little water
[34:38] I pray you be fetched and wash your feet
[34:41] and rest yourselves under the tree so
[34:44] very quickly melchized gave him Bread
[34:46] and Wine
[34:46] and now he was doing food washing amen
[34:49] so communion and foot washing is
[34:51] restored back to the church
[34:53] amen
[34:54] and I will fetch a morsel of bread and
[34:57] comfort he your hearts after that you
[35:00] pass on for therefore for you come to
[35:04] your servant
[35:06] and they said so do as thou has said and
[35:09] Abram Abraham acen into the tent unto
[35:12] Sarah and said make ready
[35:15] quickly three measures of fine meal need
[35:19] it and make cakes upon the Earth that's
[35:22] like an oven right and Abraham ran unto
[35:25] the herd and fetched a calf tender and
[35:29] good and gave it unto a young man
[35:33] and he haste to dress it
[35:35] amen hallelujah
[35:38] praise the Lord amen
[35:41] so that's typing the sacrifice that's to
[35:43] come there's a lamb so God is
[35:46] establishing our Lord is now he's the
[35:48] meal offering if you're noticing now
[35:50] is the drink offering being poured out
[35:52] he's got water he's got Jesus say I'm
[35:55] the bread of life he's the bread in this
[35:57] chapter is he the water Living Waters
[36:00] there's water in the chapter amen is
[36:03] there a lamb yeah
[36:04] amen hallelujah praise the Lord and
[36:08] young men shall arise
[36:10] amen and sweep this message to the
[36:13] coming of the Lord
[36:15] these men sitting on the stage that's
[36:17] what the prophet is saying now if they
[36:19] can take this message they'll make more
[36:21] sense to it
[36:23] is Abraham giving the cup to a young man
[36:26] amen amen amen gave it unto a young man
[36:30] and he asked her to dress it and he took
[36:33] butter and milk and the cough which he
[36:36] had risked and said it before them and
[36:39] he stood by them under the tree and they
[36:41] did eat amen praise the Lord and they
[36:44] said unto him where is Sarah thy wife so
[36:47] notice the message is Progressive now
[36:49] amen
[36:51] God never stopped them anyway let me
[36:53] just read so you I can get you seated
[36:55] right
[36:56] where is Sarah thy wife and he said
[36:59] behold in the tent
[37:01] and he said I will certainly return unto
[37:03] thee according to the time of life and
[37:05] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[37:09] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[37:11] was behind him
[37:12] now Abraham and Sarah were old and
[37:15] well-stricken in age and it seized to be
[37:17] with Sarah after the man of woman
[37:19] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[37:21] saying after I am wax old shall I have
[37:24] pleasure my Lord being old also so this
[37:28] is not spoken now this is in a heart
[37:30] she's mocking and and saying these
[37:32] things
[37:33] now the Lord says is anything too hard
[37:36] for the Lord
[37:37] at the time appointed we spoke on time
[37:40] and season last week I will return unto
[37:43] thee according to the time of life and
[37:46] Sarah shall have a son
[37:49] then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for
[37:52] she was afraid and he said nay but thou
[37:56] did love
[37:58] amen so the Lord will have the final say
[38:00] that amen then let's go to Hebrews 11
[38:02] 11. Hallelujah
[38:05] Hebrews 11 11. you're the Apostle Paul
[38:09] is getting some insight into Sarah
[38:15] with the 11th Hour workers so in the
[38:18] 11th chapter of faith in the 11th verse
[38:20] he talks about the woman conceiving is
[38:23] that us
[38:24] yes amen hallelujah
[38:28] through faith also Sarah herself
[38:31] received strength to conceive seed amen
[38:37] amen so that strength is coming from a
[38:39] world
[38:42] that word that word strength means power
[38:44] she received power to conceive Amen to
[38:47] the word is giving you that now
[38:49] through faith also Sarah herself
[38:51] receives strength to conceive seed and
[38:53] was delivered of a child when she was
[38:56] past age because she judged him faithful
[38:58] who had promised amen amen and one more
[39:02] verse of scripture in Proverbs 18 20
[39:05] . amen
[39:08] sorry 1821 1821

[41:44] topic now is
[41:47] creative power is in who
[41:50] creative power is in you even now
[41:53] amen the power to create is within you
[41:57] amen but you've got to believe it
[41:58] because all things of God must be
[42:00] received of
[42:01] Faith amen so what are we learning in
[42:04] Genesis 18 now in the first 15 verses
[42:06] there is a final sign and a final
[42:09] message
[42:10] amen all these years God had been
[42:13] training Abraham and bringing him up to
[42:14] a point he was getting rid of all the
[42:17] doubt and all of the unbelief amen but
[42:19] they come one at evening time amen amen
[42:22] they came one at evening time with the
[42:24] final message amen amen and only the
[42:27] predestinator of God can understand and
[42:29] receive the message of the hour amen so
[42:32] you'll find even there in the way the
[42:34] verse starts out he says the Lord
[42:36] appeared unto him in the planes of
[42:38] memory
[42:39] the memory is a place called strength
[42:44] amen it's a place of strength and power
[42:47] amen so Abraham is living even though he
[42:50] has not physically changed he is living
[42:52] in the land of strength amen amen it's
[42:55] where all trees are growing and he's
[42:57] sitting by this whole tree
[42:59] amen and I thank God that we have some
[43:01] oak trees in the message of the hour men
[43:03] who are unmoved amen hallelujah despite
[43:06] them not seeing the promise in their day
[43:08] they stood firm like an oak tree
[43:10] and they preach the message of the hour
[43:13] Amen in the face of criticism they
[43:15] preach the message of the hour
[43:18] amen hallelujah praise the Lord now they
[43:22] come to the tent door now it must have
[43:23] been a good day
[43:25] Abraham must have woken up this day and
[43:27] said there's never been a day like this
[43:30] day to me never been a day like this day
[43:34] I've seen
[43:36] never been a light that shines so bright
[43:39] like this day this glorious day amen
[43:44] hallelujah now you get what you expect
[43:48] and Abraham was sitting there on the
[43:49] expectation
[43:51] amen waiting for the coming of the Lord
[43:53] amen and we are waiting right now
[43:56] waiting to receive the promised son amen
[43:59] hallelujah so he sees these three men
[44:01] coming to the tento amen and he runs to
[44:03] them and he bows himself in worship and
[44:06] he says my Lord if now I found favor in
[44:09] your sight and we know that Abraham had
[44:11] already found favor in the sight of the
[44:13] Lord amen same like you you are sitting
[44:16] here in the message of the hour because
[44:18] you found favor in the sight of the Lord
[44:20] you are not your chance you are not here
[44:22] through marriage amen you are here to
[44:24] the predestinated plan of almighty God
[44:27] God had chosen you to come into the
[44:29] message of the hour
[44:30] amen maybe you feel like God has
[44:32] forgotten about you because here time
[44:35] had passed
[44:36] since the Lord called Abraham amen 25
[44:39] years had passed but God has not
[44:41] forgotten about you amen amen you will
[44:44] be a bury that Dream Within you you are
[44:46] made bury the promise within you but God
[44:49] has not forgotten about you
[44:51] amen is bringing a word to bring to pass
[44:54] the promise in your life so the final
[44:57] message is given to Abraham is the
[44:59] promise that Sarah not AGA yes
[45:03] that Sarah will produce the cell from
[45:06] our own womb
[45:07] we have just been through the previous
[45:09] chapter
[45:11] where they tried to do God a service
[45:13] without it being his will she gave agar
[45:16] unto Abraham and she said producer son
[45:19] through him
[45:20] amen but there was not God's provided
[45:22] way
[45:23] he says Sarah you shall have
[45:25] amen hallelujah I want you amen whether
[45:28] you're young or old I want you to know
[45:30] you shall produce the Life of Christ
[45:33] amen your mother will produce the Life
[45:34] of Christ yes but the Lord wants you to
[45:37] produce the Life of Christ
[45:39] amen you can't depend on your father
[45:41] producing The Life of Christ you can't
[45:43] depend on your mother producing The Life
[45:45] of Christ
[45:47] amen every one of us has got to produce
[45:50] the Life of Christ amen say Amen
[45:52] somebody amen some of us need to become
[45:55] pregnant amen some of us need to get
[45:57] pregnated with the word amen amen
[46:00] hallelujah some of us may have aborted
[46:03] the word
[46:04] but it's time to get re-impregnated amen
[46:07] it's time to take the word within us yes
[46:11] amen hallelujah so the final message is
[46:13] that Sarah shall conceive
[46:17] that's the final message that comes in
[46:18] Genesis 18. you will produce the Life of
[46:21] Christ
[46:22] yes
[46:24] that's what the message of the hour came
[46:26] to do
[46:27] to bring us up into that statue of the
[46:29] perfect man to meet The Headstone come
[46:31] in
[46:32] and what was the final sign so there's a
[46:34] final message and a final sign the final
[46:37] sign is the back turned I don't want to
[46:40] turn because you're going to see my bald
[46:41] spot
[46:44] the final sign is the back turn
[46:47] and he's deserting Sarah's heart
[46:51] yes didn't brother Branham do that yes
[46:53] what was that a son of man was revealing
[46:57] the son of man
[46:58] showing us the same scene is reproduced
[47:01] again
[47:02] amen and all his life from 1933 he was
[47:05] waiting for a message
[47:08] amen doubt it at the Ohio River your
[47:11] message your foreign the second coming
[47:13] amen amen so all his life he waited for
[47:16] a message and the message came in 1963
[47:19] yeah
[47:21] amen hallelujah I need you to drive all
[47:23] unbelief out the message came in 1963
[47:27] when seven angels descended in a cloud
[47:31] yes yes this is not a cloud formed by
[47:34] rocket fuel neither is this a rain cloud
[47:36] this is a cloud amen that's formed by
[47:39] seven angels
[47:40] amen hallelujah a cloud formed by seven
[47:44] angels He says the Angels themselves
[47:46] formed his weak
[47:49] amen so you find if you read from verse
[47:52] 16 onwards you'll see the judge of all
[47:54] the Earth
[47:55] and that's what he's coming he's coming
[47:57] to give a final message to us brothers
[47:59] and sisters but he's also coming to

[48:25] but God promises he's going to bless him
[48:27] amen now he's living in his inheritance
[48:29] he's living in His blessings and he can
[48:31] offer back to the Lord everything that
[48:34] the Lord had given him praise the Lord

[49:13] hallelujah so let's let's go on now amen
[49:17] now we're talking about creative power
[49:20] in you
[49:22] but we've been lied to in this world
[49:24] since we were born
[49:26] we've been taught to trust our five
[49:28] senses
[49:29] and what we see
[49:31] amen
[49:33] amen amen
[49:35] do you believe brother Tyler is sitting
[49:37] next to you do you afraid to believe
[49:38] that look at him
[49:41] do you need Faith to believe that
[49:44] because you can see him
[49:47] amen hallelujah but if I truly the angel
[49:50] of the Lord is sitting right there right

[49:52] amen
[49:54] you'll need Faith to believe that amen
[49:58] amen Faith looks to the Unseen amen amen
[50:01] amen so we are not to look at our
[50:03] situations our problem with the cni amen
[50:06] amen
[50:07] amen we must deny these senses whether
[50:10] we see it or not whatever you trust in
[50:12] the Lord for whether you see it or not
[50:14] whether you feel it or not you believe
[50:16] the Lord
[50:18] his word has created Power to bring it
[50:20] to pass in your life
[50:22] amen amen
[50:23] now when God created this man in Genesis
[50:27] 1 27 he had just finished creating and
[50:29] he spoke by the spoken word now he says
[50:32] I'm going to create a man like me who
[50:34] can speak the word
[50:36] that's how we will ought to be that
[50:38] should be taught in every syllabus
[50:41] yes that should be taught in every
[50:43] school
[50:44] this is where we fell from amen man is
[50:47] powerful yeah yeah man is an amateur God
[50:50] amen after God said let him have
[50:54] dominion over the Earth God never took
[50:57] that Dominion back
[51:02] come on now
[51:04] God will not walk contrary to his word
[51:06] God said that as a law
[51:09] and God is bringing back sons and
[51:11] daughters on the earth even now
[51:13] to take dominion over all things
[51:16] amen the problem is we need to get all
[51:19] unbelief out of us we need to get
[51:21] negative thinking out of us amen we need
[51:23] to believe the word of God so much so
[51:25] amen that is thus saith the Lord
[51:28] I don't know why we are waiting for
[51:29] Dusty and the Lord and the word of God
[51:31] is that said the Lord amen there's a
[51:34] quote here where the prophet of God is
[51:35] saying I was somebody told me to pray
[51:37] for the sister she was sick and I went
[51:40] there and I began to pray and I said
[51:42] Lord show me a vision and he said the
[51:43] Lord came and condemned him and he says
[51:45] why do you need a vision because vision
[51:47] is secondary
[51:49] a gift given to a property secondary it
[51:52] doesn't over amen power the word of God
[51:54] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[51:57] word will never pass away
[51:58] the prophet says I woke up from there
[52:00] and I applied the scripture yes
[52:03] hallelujah amen people are living
[52:06] defeated lives now because they can't
[52:08] see the prophet of God around but he
[52:10] came to restore back the word of God
[52:11] believe back in the word of God that
[52:14] these signs shall follow them that
[52:15] believe if we lay hands upon the sick
[52:18] they shall recover
[52:21] amen now the devil desired desire to be
[52:24] like the Genesis 1 27 person yes
[52:27] because he doesn't have the power to
[52:28] create
[52:30] but this man was a God man walking in
[52:32] Eden yes and yeah the prophet said that
[52:34] the devil cannot create but he perverts
[52:37] what God has already created and that's
[52:39] what he did to many perverted their
[52:41] thinking
[52:42] right you know in Isaiah 14 he tells you
[52:45] amen how he says I will Ascend you to
[52:48] heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[52:50] stars of God I will also sit upon the
[52:52] Mount of the congregation in the sides
[52:54] of the north I will Ascend above the
[52:56] eyes of the clouds I will be like the
[52:58] most high
[53:00] the desire that Satan had God gave it to
[53:03] you
[53:05] for you to be like the most high amen
[53:10] church is another time to play around
[53:13] Sons and Daughters must come to their
[53:14] position Sons and Daughters might come
[53:16] to their full inheritance amen we've
[53:19] been living under our privileges for far
[53:20] too long
[53:21] amen hallelujah
[53:23] the prophet of God says that science has
[53:25] taken man more in the relative up in the
[53:28] Realms of science than the church has
[53:30] taken them in the world
[53:34] amen
[53:35] Hallelujah
[53:38] the church world is only focused around
[53:39] monetary value yeah
[53:41] amen about a car or a house or a few
[53:44] hundred dollars
[53:46] amen that's all they keep them there
[53:48] yeah
[53:49] but we have gone past them amen amen we
[53:52] are going back Amen to Genesis 1 27 amen
[53:55] we are going all the way back to the
[53:57] original creation amen amen amen I know
[54:00] not everybody will receive that because
[54:01] that's not our expectation amen so the
[54:04] prophet of God says he is calling his
[54:05] church giving her that final last call
[54:08] that final last sign that she would
[54:10] receive
[54:11] he says there's about to be a new world
[54:13] born and a new church born to go to it
[54:16] for the Millennium a final sign a final
[54:19] message a final sign is to get in the
[54:22] conditions like she was where
[54:25] you never
[54:26] do you see what the message come to do
[54:28] the property is saying to get into the
[54:31] condition like she was at the beginning
[54:36] amen we call those things that are not
[54:38] as though they are
[54:40] amen hallelujah
[54:43] so yeah he's saying he the spirit
[54:45] overshadowed the Virgin Mary and she
[54:47] brought forth the Sun by a creature of
[54:50] power
[54:54] yes Luke 1 35 the angel of the Lord
[54:56] answered and said the Holy Ghost shall
[54:58] come upon thee and the power of the
[55:01] highest shall overshadow thee therefore
[55:04] also that Holy thing which shall be born
[55:06] of thee shall be called the son of God
[55:09] so the power the creator of power came
[55:12] into the home of Mary
[55:16] now this might shock some people's
[55:17] theology but he created both the egg and
[55:20] the sperm
[55:21] yeah yes amen amen
[55:24] it wasn't any human part yes
[55:26] Hallelujah now while we're talking about
[55:29] that somebody else your neighbor can't
[55:32] produce the Life of Christ for you
[55:34] you can't have a surrogate by them you
[55:37] can't have a surrogate experience you
[55:39] yourself have got to be impregnated and
[55:42] you yourself have got to bring forth the
[55:44] Life of Christ amen
[55:47] that's why Peter says I don't want you
[55:49] to be better not unfruitful
[55:51] amen amen hallelujah let's move along
[55:53] brother oh we're going to go to some
[55:54] good stuff now the other Prophet is
[55:56] talking about a person who had leukemia
[55:58] in the blood so leukemias can't say the
[56:00] blood
[56:00] all my doctors Google friends here Dr
[56:02] Googles
[56:04] leukemia is cancer in the blood
[56:06] amen so he says when he prayed for her
[56:09] it wasn't one trace of leukemia found in
[56:12] the child now he says that's
[56:14] instantaneously

[56:47] in there your bloodstream is your life
[56:49] and create new cells and clean out the
[56:51] old what is it the creative act of
[56:54] almighty God to take a bloodstream
[56:56] that's contaminated with cancer and
[56:58] within just a few moments time a brand
[57:01] new blood stream
[57:03] maybe there's something wrong with your
[57:05] plan maybe they'll shoot too much sugar

[57:09] bring it back to normal even now in an
[57:11] instant maybe your right your blood

[1:06:01] way I'm getting to
[1:06:03] some people have not confessed their sin
[1:06:04] so that's why they can't get back to
[1:06:06] their condition but he says When sin is
[1:06:08] broke up when sin is confessed upon the
[1:06:11] basis of the blood of Jesus Christ it's
[1:06:13] like dropping a drop of Black Ink in a
[1:06:15] batch of Clorox it breaks into all the
[1:06:18] chemicals and send it back to where it
[1:06:20] comes from that's the way the blood of
[1:06:22] Jesus Christ does now it's very
[1:06:24] important why I'm bringing this here I
[1:06:26] don't I didn't put up the quote on the
[1:06:28] slide but yes to there's twins girls
[1:06:33] right come to this Prophet is relating
[1:06:35] this now

[1:06:45] and they have venereal disease
[1:06:49] they've got when they did all the tears
[1:06:51] they are shocked
[1:06:53] because his girls are Pure Clean living
[1:06:55] girls
[1:06:57] and they do the test
[1:06:59] and they find that these girls have
[1:07:00] venereal disease
[1:07:05] the prophet says now because he's a
[1:07:08] prophet he can see it he says it wasn't
[1:07:11] them it was their grandfather
[1:07:14] he says the sins of the church has come
[1:07:17] out to the third generation
[1:07:19] ah maybe you've been struggling with
[1:07:21] something
[1:07:22] and that thing is not under the blood
[1:07:25] because only things that are under the
[1:07:27] blood that curse will be forgiven amen
[1:07:30] I want to break every chain and every
[1:07:32] cup from your grandparents your
[1:07:34] great-grandparents that may be coming
[1:07:36] upon your life that Spirit of poverty
[1:07:39] may be because of your great great
[1:07:40] grandparents but you need to bring that
[1:07:41] under the blood and you need to say Lord
[1:07:43] sin who is broke up you're at the cross
[1:07:47] whatever they did Lord I'm putting it
[1:07:48] under the blood
[1:07:50] I'm receiving my healing amen
[1:07:53] these things shall not touch my children
[1:07:55] all my children children right here now
[1:07:58] I'm bringing it under the blood
[1:08:00] amen sometimes you wonder why you
[1:08:02] struggle with things amen don't you go
[1:08:05] to the doctor and they ask you did your
[1:08:07] father have cancer did your father have
[1:08:10] high blood pressure did your father have
[1:08:12] heart disease tell him listen here no my
[1:08:15] father did not have
[1:08:17] [Music]
[1:08:21] he was my heart patient sorry
[1:08:24] there's My Father Here Jesus Christ king
[1:08:28] of kings and Lord of lords he has no
[1:08:30] history about problem
[1:08:32] I am no longer the son of Charles and
[1:08:35] Ella Branham you see the doctors he's
[1:08:37] trying to pass that on to you so when
[1:08:39] you're going to the the doctor's room
[1:08:41] and they say do you have history of
[1:08:43] Cancer and a history of heart disease in
[1:08:46] your family don't ever say yes
[1:08:48] Satan is waiting to jump through your
[1:08:50] confession that's right say no I've
[1:08:53] never had a history of it
[1:08:55] yes you know what you're talking about
[1:08:57] God is your father God is your Source
[1:09:01] God is your strength yes Lord thank you
[1:09:04] thank you amen so he says when that is
[1:09:07] confessed now it puts man across the
[1:09:10] chasm again puts him back in his
[1:09:11] original position as a Son of God the
[1:09:14] creative power of God is in him
[1:09:18] amen yes
[1:09:20] he says under the blood of bulls and
[1:09:22] goats when he meant to pull out fire and
[1:09:25] the word of the Lord came to him he
[1:09:26] created things by the word now if you
[1:09:29] don't do that under the blood of bulls
[1:09:30] yeah
[1:09:31] what about the blood of Jesus
[1:09:34] you stand in the presence of God now a
[1:09:36] redeemed son the church is far below
[1:09:39] with standard of living and I think too
[1:09:41] many times we're progging instead of
[1:09:43] really coming out and facing the issue
[1:09:46] let's not be that way
[1:09:49] amen
[1:09:51] slowly moving along
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:55] Hallelujah he says when you become a
[1:09:58] prisoner surrounded in Christ Christ is
[1:10:00] in you his life bringing forth his
[1:10:02] evidence he signs bringing his signs as
[1:10:04] of life as he evident of his
[1:10:06] resurrection proving to the world that
[1:10:08] eternal life vindicates to the world
[1:10:10] that we are alive in him and I think of
[1:10:13] it alive with God Our Redeemer who
[1:10:15] created us for the very same purpose the
[1:10:17] church and his creative life in US
[1:10:21] men
[1:10:24] let's look at our Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:10:28] Matthew 12 10. here's a man who doesn't
[1:10:31] have a hand
[1:10:34] you want Bible I'll give you Bible
[1:10:36] the man's hand is withered
[1:10:39] hello yes yes
[1:10:42] and Jesus tells him
[1:10:44] stretch what thy hand
[1:10:46] and as he stretches forth his hand he's
[1:10:48] at his restore hole instantaneously like
[1:10:52] as the other
[1:10:54] amen
[1:10:59] you know any manufacturer carries spare
[1:11:01] parts
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:04] amen yes Hallelujah come on now any
[1:11:08] manufacturer carries spare parts amen
[1:11:12] now some people like to save money and
[1:11:17] they fix the old broken part
[1:11:20] no matter how many times you break down
[1:11:22] they'll go and fix something they'll fix
[1:11:24] it they they keep taking it to a
[1:11:26] mechanic but there's some they don't
[1:11:28] have time for them yes
[1:11:30] yes they go straight to the manufacturer
[1:11:32] you can go to the Ramesh and go to
[1:11:35] brother uh
[1:11:37] and you can get a part just like the
[1:11:40] original
[1:11:42] original
[1:11:45] I see some of you don't want to believe
[1:11:47] this
[1:11:48] this is a great power this is Jesus is
[1:11:51] showing us how Adam operated was he the
[1:11:54] last Adam yes yeah so he came to show us
[1:11:56] how Adam operated yeah
[1:11:59] so the man doesn't even have a hand
[1:12:02] Jesus says to him stretch for thine hand
[1:12:05] amen and he stretched it forward there's
[1:12:07] a part for him to do now he stretches it
[1:12:10] forth and it was restored whole like as
[1:12:13] the other
[1:12:17] there was a young girl
[1:12:20] she had cancer in her ovaries
[1:12:24] and I don't know all these terms I was
[1:12:26] just reading it something about a
[1:12:27] fallopian tube you probably your sisters
[1:12:29] don't know what that is there to remove
[1:12:31] that with the one over it
[1:12:34] right
[1:12:36] to get rid of the cancer
[1:12:39] so
[1:12:40] the surgery went through they removed
[1:12:42] everything it was successful
[1:12:44] now like with any surgery they give it
[1:12:46] time to pass to see if there is
[1:12:49] a Resurgence of the cancer
[1:12:52] right but these people this mother and
[1:12:54] father
[1:12:55] started to pray back the word of God
[1:12:59] that by the stripes of Jesus she's
[1:13:01] healed amen
[1:13:03] and they started to speak the word back
[1:13:06] that this child is just a young child
[1:13:08] and they desire to see you have children
[1:13:12] so some time passes that you have to go
[1:13:15] back for a checkup and they kept
[1:13:16] confessing the word of God
[1:13:18] kept confessing the word of God
[1:13:21] sometime past
[1:13:23] they go back
[1:13:26] and they tell them sorry
[1:13:29] the cancer has spread to the other
[1:13:32] and we need to remove that as well
[1:13:35] these parents refused to believe that
[1:13:37] report of the doctor
[1:13:40] so they go back and they start to pray
[1:13:42] and believe the word of God and confess
[1:13:45] that over the doctor and they said the
[1:13:47] doctor finally told him you have to make
[1:13:49] a decision now we have to operate
[1:13:51] otherwise this cancer is going to spread
[1:13:54] they started to pray and they said when
[1:13:56] the doctor operates
[1:13:57] this cancer must just pop off
[1:14:01] and that fallopian tube and that ovary
[1:14:04] must not be touched
[1:14:07] right
[1:14:08] when the doctors are performing their
[1:14:10] thing
[1:14:11] like they spoke it this thing pops off
[1:14:14] amen it pops off right
[1:14:19] so the operation is successful obviously
[1:14:21] the parents are not in the operating
[1:14:22] room so they go back the doctor comes to
[1:14:25] give a report
[1:14:27] and he tells him we don't know what
[1:14:29] happened but the cancer just popped off
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:34] and he says upon doing our scans
[1:14:37] we can see two ovaries and two fallopian
[1:14:41] troops
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:47] so the doctor is puzzled he the same
[1:14:49] Doctor Who
[1:14:51] is telling them that there's a new one
[1:14:52] there amen amen hallelujah
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:14:59] you see we've not believed been
[1:15:01] believing at that level
[1:15:03] we've been been believing for repairs
[1:15:10] some of us have had a service plan
[1:15:13] what do we need participation
[1:15:15] a maintenance plan
[1:15:17] where they replace parts
[1:15:24] now you can quote back the word Lord you
[1:15:26] did it in Matthew 12. yes you gave the
[1:15:29] man a new hand amen
[1:15:35] so the sun you know where I'm going with
[1:15:36] this
[1:15:38] the Lord can give you a new alarm
[1:15:41] the Lord can give you a new heart I
[1:15:43] believe he's already done it yes amen
[1:15:45] that's right
[1:15:48] you know what you need brother Ramesh we
[1:15:50] already spoke about it yes
[1:15:52] says he can feel it being formed daily
[1:15:54] amen brand new parts
[1:15:56] and he's a man who can live out of
[1:15:58] experience because he deals with pots
[1:16:02] effective you return it back yes
[1:16:05] the manufacturer has got to replace it
[1:16:08] who created us amen who's our
[1:16:12] manufacturer

[1:16:23] he's one of the FB he's the fbis of
[1:16:25] juvenile juveniles right
[1:16:28] so they had a little boy

[1:16:39] he had no hip bone
[1:16:41] and when the little fellow was brought
[1:16:43] in laying on the court the Holy Spirit
[1:16:45] told him who he was and what happened
[1:16:47] his little faith and asked him to rise
[1:16:49] from the court
[1:16:51] he's got no hip bone
[1:16:56] hello what do you think is going to
[1:16:58] happen

[1:17:49] the message of the hour and here is it
[1:17:52] Christ's mystery he says this is God's
[1:17:54] great mystery of Love expressed
[1:17:56] that God and man became one what is it
[1:17:59] being filled with his Spirit him having
[1:18:01] the preeminences
[1:18:04] I've been saying this for a while some
[1:18:05] of us think the holy spirit is too
[1:18:07] demanding he wants too much of my time
[1:18:09] so I don't want the Holy Spirit I just
[1:18:11] want to come to church I just want to
[1:18:13] hear a good sermon
[1:18:17] but he wants to have the preeminances
[1:18:19] that was God's achievement that God's
[1:18:22] purpose to do that that he might be in
[1:18:24] Christ and Christ in us and all of us
[1:18:26] together the same the Holy Spirit same

[1:21:24] creative power
[1:21:27] which sets in the church this morning
[1:21:31] imagine resisting the church and the
[1:21:33] people didn't know it
[1:21:35] but that's why he sent us a prophet amen
[1:21:39] the very people it was created on
[1:21:42] oh Jesus thou Son of God come again
[1:21:44] anoint your church freely
[1:21:47] fully

[1:21:50] May the spirit of the living resurrected
[1:21:52] Jesus resurrect this little church this

[1:21:57] power of faith that we might put every
[1:22:00] gains here to shame Grant you Lord amen
[1:22:03] somebody receive it amen amen amen amen
[1:22:06] amen
[1:22:08] the body is the flesh that you look at
[1:22:10] that must rot it was born by sexual
[1:22:13] desire with your father and mother it
[1:22:15] must brought it's no good therefore in
[1:22:17] the new birth in the resurrection when
[1:22:19] you're brought forth again in a new body
[1:22:21] it will be God's creative power that
[1:22:23] will speak like he did to Adam and you
[1:22:25] will come forth amen
[1:22:29] your new body will come forth
[1:22:32] through God's creative power
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:35] yeah
[1:22:37] he says lord they're seeking more life
[1:22:39] after hearing that the blood of Jesus so
[1:22:41] thoroughly cleanses
[1:22:42] that there's no more nothing that the
[1:22:44] complete word of God rests within them
[1:22:48] is it resting within us
[1:22:51] that the very command of the pastor's
[1:22:53] voice is creative power
[1:22:57] that the very command of the Evangelist
[1:22:59] voice is creative power
[1:23:05] very creative the very command of there
[1:23:10] own
[1:23:11] voice
[1:23:12] is creative power because in them is
[1:23:18] Holy Ghost
[1:23:21] and this Holy Ghost is a
[1:23:25] he makes things come to pass because he
[1:23:28] speaks the word and the word spoken
[1:23:31] becomes God in action
[1:23:33] amen
[1:23:34] the word thought I'm having good
[1:23:37] thoughts
[1:23:40] the word
[1:23:42] if God had remained back
[1:23:44] Before Time with Just Thoughts in his
[1:23:46] head and never spoke
[1:23:47] nothing would have happened
[1:23:51] the Bible said the prophet teaches I
[1:23:53] said he was living alone with his
[1:23:54] thoughts
[1:23:55] he had all of these thoughts in his head
[1:23:57] but one day he looked and he said let
[1:24:00] there be amen light
[1:24:03] you've been thinking about your
[1:24:05] situation for too long
[1:24:07] you've been pondering about it
[1:24:10] Mary Ponder these things in our heart
[1:24:12] but then she had to speak
[1:24:15] Let It Be unto me according to Thy Word
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:22] we have testimonies
[1:24:25] of people speaking to the fridge that
[1:24:27] wasn't working
[1:24:29] people speaking to their car engine
[1:24:31] people speaking to their odometer
[1:24:34] people speaking to a natural situation
[1:24:36] people speaking to salty water and it
[1:24:38] comes back normal
[1:24:42] dead baby raised back to life amen come
[1:24:45] on now amen yes dead baby raised back to
[1:24:49] life
[1:24:51] people with AIDS HIV positive completely
[1:24:55] healed without any treatment
[1:25:00] amen
[1:25:04] amen amen
[1:25:06] amen hallelujah
[1:25:09] praise the Lord thank you
[1:25:11] the Holy Ghost is a Creator it makes
[1:25:13] things come to pass because he speaks
[1:25:15] the word and the word spoken becomes God
[1:25:18] in action oh yes
[1:25:21] so when the word leaves your mouth
[1:25:26] he says when a man confesses his sins
[1:25:28] and gets right with God God drops the
[1:25:30] sin of his of this confession into the
[1:25:32] blood of his own blood forgives that sin
[1:25:35] and replaces in that man the original
[1:25:37] spirit that should be there
[1:25:40] his own Spirit making him a Son of God
[1:25:42] how much more ought the creative power
[1:25:44] of God be in the church
[1:25:46] that some of you maybe sooner are
[1:25:47] finding out to believe that God say he
[1:25:50] will give you a new heart
[1:25:54] did he say I'll give you a news
[1:25:57] Spirit I'm sure for us to ask him amen
[1:26:00] he said a new heart will I give you a
[1:26:03] new spirit will I give you amen the
[1:26:05] prophet is confirming when the sin is
[1:26:07] confessed God puts the original spirit
[1:26:10] that should have been in man
[1:26:13] and creative power of God ought to be in
[1:26:16] the church
[1:26:21] he says when you pray believe you
[1:26:22] receive what you have asked for you
[1:26:24] shall have it
[1:26:25] see after receiving the spirit of God
[1:26:28] now God made the world out of nothing
[1:26:30] it's just his word he just created his
[1:26:32] word is creation
[1:26:34] spoke it and the word world was created
[1:26:36] because it was the object of God's mind
[1:26:38] in his heart he spoke it came into
[1:26:40] existence then if we have Zoe light
[1:26:42] God's life in us if we become sons of
[1:26:44] God and amateur creators
[1:26:47] see then he goes back to the scripture
[1:26:49] whatsoever you say believe you shall
[1:26:52] have
[1:26:53] now here's something the prophet also
[1:26:55] mentions he says I notice a lot of time
[1:26:57] I'd say things I couldn't hardly think
[1:27:00] myself but I'd say it anyhow so don't
[1:27:02] speak up as of words
[1:27:04] he says and I come to find out it did
[1:27:06] happen just that way
[1:27:10] so when you speak words into your
[1:27:12] children and say you're good for nothing
[1:27:14] you'll amount to Nothing in life
[1:27:16] you are speaking over them
[1:27:23] he says a lot of time I couldn't
[1:27:25] couldn't hardly think myself but I'd say
[1:27:27] it anyhow and I come to find out it did
[1:27:30] happen just that way I'd say things I
[1:27:33] didn't hardly mean for it to happen that
[1:27:35] way but it did anyhow because I said it
[1:27:37] I thought
[1:27:40] wait a minute so I said you see when we
[1:27:42] speak anything if something is anchored
[1:27:44] to us we shouldn't shouldn't never speak
[1:27:47] it till we believe it then when we
[1:27:50] believe it we speak it and that creative
[1:27:52] word goes out it's part of God and it
[1:27:55] creates amen
[1:28:00] some of us need to cancel words that we
[1:28:02] have spoken
[1:28:05] because we've spoken words like nothing
[1:28:07] good ever happens to me
[1:28:12] so the high priest takes your confession
[1:28:15] the prayer is going up
[1:28:17] what can I do for my son he says nothing
[1:28:19] good
[1:28:21] ever happens to him okay we'll send the
[1:28:24] word back to him
[1:28:27] according to his confession he will have
[1:28:29] it
[1:28:30] so your confession is nothing good ever
[1:28:32] happens to me
[1:28:34] your confession is nobody loves me
[1:28:41] your confession is I'm poor because my
[1:28:43] father was poor
[1:28:46] but you need to be adopted son
[1:28:52] you're struggling with something even
[1:28:53] it's a literal thing a physical thing
[1:28:55] and you're struggling with it you say I
[1:28:58] can do all things through Christ who
[1:29:00] gives me strength amen his strength is
[1:29:03] perfect in my weakness
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:09] your child is acting up
[1:29:13] maybe they are
[1:29:16] Restless
[1:29:18] they're not behaving
[1:29:20] say I thank you Lord Jesus that my child
[1:29:22] is the holy spirit amen
[1:29:25] I thank you Lord you have the mind of
[1:29:27] Christ amen I thank you Lord they are
[1:29:29] created in your image and after your
[1:29:31] likeness yes confess the word over them
[1:29:33] amen and you watch this if you really
[1:29:36] believe that in an instant you'll see
[1:29:38] the change
[1:29:39] a whole other atmosphere comes over that
[1:29:41] child
[1:29:44] what great spirit is there than the Holy
[1:29:47] Spirit
[1:29:49] instead of going to see a psychologist
[1:29:51] you can ask the great physician together
[1:29:54] yes
[1:29:57] they tell you in school your child is
[1:30:00] not behaving
[1:30:01] you speak and I say thank you Lord that
[1:30:03] my child is behaving amen
[1:30:06] they say it's not concentrating say I
[1:30:08] thank you Lord that he has the best
[1:30:09] concentration
[1:30:13] and you maintain the confession
[1:30:19] so he says we should never speak
[1:30:21] anything so we believe it
[1:30:23] amen
[1:30:24] Hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:30:27] amen
[1:30:30] yeah this is what I wanted to get to
[1:30:32] because sometimes you speak Idle Words
[1:30:33] he says in the beginning was the word
[1:30:35] and the word spoken was creative word
[1:30:37] and every word spoken cannot be taken
[1:30:40] back for a mistake
[1:30:43] so what you've got to do remember we
[1:30:45] spoke on Esther
[1:30:46] they couldn't change amens
[1:30:49] writing
[1:30:51] I mean if you remember the message let
[1:30:53] it be written
[1:30:54] they couldn't change Esther's I mean
[1:30:56] eamonn's law so the king told Esther
[1:30:59] write a new law
[1:31:01] Amen to counter the law already written
[1:31:05] so I had negative words that have gone
[1:31:07] out of your mouth send forth a fresh
[1:31:09] word cancel those words
[1:31:13] amen
[1:31:14] can't be taken back
[1:31:16] right
[1:31:20] and now the word of God written in the
[1:31:22] Bible in his word to us and every
[1:31:24] promise has the same power of creation
[1:31:26] behind it
[1:31:28] if I were you I'd go and look for every
[1:31:30] promise and now Google has it much
[1:31:32] easier
[1:31:33] could search there for 100 Promises of
[1:31:35] God or maybe promises on healing if
[1:31:38] that's what you trust in the Lord for
[1:31:40] promises on whatever it is
[1:31:42] people have made it much easier you can
[1:31:44] find scriptures just on that
[1:31:49] every promise has the same power of
[1:31:52] creation behind it
[1:31:53] that God's word did at the beginning
[1:31:58] what he said the promise is written in
[1:32:02] this Bible
[1:32:03] if it is believed by faith
[1:32:06] and you apply it by faith
[1:32:09] it has the same creative power like at
[1:32:12] the beginning
[1:32:13] it must come forth if we believe it to
[1:32:17] be the word of God depends where the
[1:32:19] seed is falling now the word is a seed
[1:32:21] depends where it's falling right now
[1:32:24] amen
[1:32:26] see if it falls into good ground it can
[1:32:29] create it needs moisture nourishment
[1:32:31] around the promise of God will bring
[1:32:33] forth every promise the Bible need
[1:32:36] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:32:38] Divine promise of God will bring it to
[1:32:40] pass
[1:32:41] if you look at it and take the word of
[1:32:43] just right if because the infinite God
[1:32:46] spoke it heavens and earth will pass
[1:32:48] away but my words will never pass amen
[1:32:51] we've got to move quickly now so he says
[1:32:53] you got a resting place which is the
[1:32:55] word of God you must believe it accept
[1:32:57] it and don't take it back hold on to it
[1:33:00] lay hold of it and say this is it God
[1:33:03] said it that settles it if God said so
[1:33:05] that's finished no matter how long 25
[1:33:08] years no problem I'm holding on to the
[1:33:10] promise amen God's word said it I
[1:33:12] believe it that settles it
[1:33:15] amen
[1:33:18] Hallelujah
[1:33:20] so he says there not one molecule may
[1:33:22] have happened but when he said let there
[1:33:24] be but he's Eternal and after a while
[1:33:26] molecules begin to come in atoms right
[1:33:29] you're getting the point amen
[1:33:39] Hallelujah
[1:33:47] let's go to slide 32 there he says if
[1:33:50] you ask the father anything in my name
[1:33:51] I'll do it now that's just straight
[1:33:53] right down off the shoulder I will do it
[1:33:56] now it's on conditions
[1:33:59] if you believe when you ask me see what
[1:34:01] the condition is You Must Believe
[1:34:04] right
[1:34:06] we find out that Jesus said if you say
[1:34:07] to this mountain be plucked up don't
[1:34:10] doubt but believe that what you have
[1:34:11] said will come to pass you can have it
[1:34:13] now the thing you just couldn't get out
[1:34:15] here and say mountain move down you've
[1:34:17] got to have a motive an objective be to
[1:34:20] that
[1:34:22] what's our motive and objective of
[1:34:23] feeling
[1:34:25] your word declares that by your stripes
[1:34:27] are in guilt
[1:34:29] if you didn't want me now some of us
[1:34:30] need to be bold
[1:34:32] I know it might sound rude
[1:34:34] but the prophet says God likes rugged
[1:34:36] faith he likes a man who is really
[1:34:38] believing it
[1:34:41] and if you can really hold you then say
[1:34:43] Lord if you don't want me to get ill you
[1:34:44] shouldn't have written this in your word
[1:34:46] because till the day I die I will
[1:34:48] believe this word that by your stripes I
[1:34:50] healed
[1:34:52] amen
[1:34:55] you didn't write there by the stripes of
[1:34:57] Jesus
[1:34:59] the people are healed except this person
[1:35:02] I am included in that verse
[1:35:04] and God I'm going to stay with this
[1:35:06] verse and if you didn't want me to have
[1:35:08] it you shouldn't have written it
[1:35:11] hmm
[1:35:14] you see you got to find out first if
[1:35:16] it's God's will is it God's word for us
[1:35:18] to be healed
[1:35:20] he sent his word and he allowed our
[1:35:22] sicknesses right then your motive and
[1:35:24] objective is to do the will of God then
[1:35:26] speak to it stand there it'll come down
[1:35:28] you see if you get the conditions right
[1:35:30] but you've got to get the conditions
[1:35:32] right
[1:35:34] amen
[1:35:42] yeah he's talking about the creative
[1:35:43] word of God must be spoken by the lips
[1:35:46] of mortal man because God uses men God
[1:35:48] could have used them use the son he
[1:35:50] could have used the wind but God chose
[1:35:52] men
[1:35:53] what's the matter with the church today
[1:35:55] there's something wrong
[1:35:58] in my opinion we're not coming with that
[1:36:00] sincerity to the right thing for that
[1:36:04] see these spiritual Diagnostics now to
[1:36:06] see why what is the problem
[1:36:11] amen
[1:36:13] is quoting again Mark 11 23 about the
[1:36:16] mountain he says where's the Pentecostal
[1:36:19] church at today
[1:36:21] where's the message church at today
[1:36:24] you don't realize that confess truly
[1:36:26] confess sin amid sin it builds a bridge
[1:36:29] across the chasm that takes man back
[1:36:31] into the presence of his creator and
[1:36:33] makes him a Son of God Amen he that
[1:36:36] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:36:37] shall you do also brother son he was
[1:36:39] telling me he was trying to talk to
[1:36:40] somebody and they said no we are not
[1:36:42] deity
[1:36:43] they can't believe that deity is in man
[1:36:47] you know what they have unbelief in
[1:36:49] their life yes they don't have the faith
[1:36:52] to raise up to that level
[1:36:54] to believe that the holy spirit in them
[1:36:57] is God and His creative power
[1:37:01] amen
[1:37:04] praise the Lord
[1:37:05] amen
[1:37:09] see in 30 37 he says when Elijah drop
[1:37:12] the Rope for Elisha you got a double
[1:37:14] portion of it Jesus said now he's
[1:37:16] talking about us receiving a double
[1:37:18] portion the work that I do shall he do
[1:37:20] also and greater than the shall he do
[1:37:22] for go unto my father amen I'm trying to
[1:37:25] speed it up here now
[1:37:27] amen
[1:37:29] you say when your sin is confessed so
[1:37:31] now if you're gonna unconfessed sin
[1:37:32] you've got to confess it that's why
[1:37:34] we're laboring on this point now
[1:37:36] and confessing under the blood of Jesus
[1:37:38] then you stand born again because the
[1:37:41] reason why I'm bringing this some of you
[1:37:42] may be asking how can I operate in this
[1:37:44] power how can I operate in this level
[1:37:46] there's the key confessing under the
[1:37:48] blood of Jesus
[1:37:49] then you stand on a doubt made to the
[1:37:52] born-again Son and Daughter of God with
[1:37:54] the life of God in you to speak a word
[1:37:56] of creation
[1:37:58] let this mountain be moved and it will
[1:38:00] mind you I mean it will obey you
[1:38:06] you see we're in Heavenly places we're
[1:38:08] now in the power of the Resurrection
[1:38:09] amen if if there wasn't a law to their
[1:38:12] sons and daughters would create them out
[1:38:14] in World here and go live a private life
[1:38:16] on it
[1:38:18] again a good fire you know brother
[1:38:20] Brandon
[1:38:24] you're what the prophet is saying
[1:38:27] if there wasn't a law to that
[1:38:31] Sons and Daughters meaning God's got a
[1:38:33] law to protect you from doing it
[1:38:36] Sons and Daughters of God would create
[1:38:38] them a world out here and will live a
[1:38:41] private life on it
[1:38:46] you have the power in you to do it
[1:38:51] if you've got a shadow of the power of
[1:38:53] God in you you've got power to do it God
[1:38:55] is omnipotent omnipotent what I mean the
[1:38:58] power that's in you will make you could
[1:39:00] speak a world into existence and go live
[1:39:02] on it
[1:39:04] somebody chew quickly
[1:39:05] true true I know it's hard me tough meat
[1:39:08] for you you can't believe that you can
[1:39:10] create a world
[1:39:12] you create a world around you all the
[1:39:14] time
[1:39:15] the atmosphere
[1:39:17] yeah
[1:39:20] that's the power in the church now being
[1:39:22] controlled by it is controlled by a law
[1:39:25] and the law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:39:26] Commandments it's the law of faith right
[1:39:29] see
[1:39:31] every place is all of your foot can set
[1:39:33] upon by your faith God gives it to you
[1:39:35] it's yours you possess it if you can
[1:39:37] find the key to this law of faith that
[1:39:39] opens it
[1:39:41] amen
[1:39:48] okay I'm gonna get to my closing culture
[1:39:56] so now the oldest word that we were
[1:39:58] created that we were eating all these
[1:40:00] years so the word we in Genesis 18 now
[1:40:03] the word that came to Sarah
[1:40:06] the Lord left a creative word for her
[1:40:09] she had to believe it
[1:40:12] right
[1:40:13] we read in Hebrews 11 11.
[1:40:16] she counted him faithful
[1:40:18] you are now talking about the body
[1:40:19] change how is the new body going to come
[1:40:21] the translation of the Bride will be the
[1:40:24] same thing the word that's in you the
[1:40:27] body will materialize around that word
[1:40:30] as the same and the same thing did by
[1:40:32] Sarah
[1:40:34] how did the word come into us
[1:40:37] revelation 10. eat the book
[1:40:41] eat the message of the hour
[1:40:45] the word that's in you
[1:40:47] the body will materialize around that
[1:40:49] word
[1:40:51] the same thing
[1:40:52] did by Sarah
[1:40:55] when that old body that she had that
[1:40:57] first body it had to be changed in order
[1:40:58] to produce a sun you get it that body
[1:41:01] couldn't do it this body cannot do it so
[1:41:04] it left to be changed the same way to
[1:41:07] receive the son
[1:41:09] so what is Genesis 8 sorry Genesis 18
[1:41:12] 1-15 I'm going to summarize this now
[1:41:14] it's a message coming forth
[1:41:17] to The Chosen bearing ground you
[1:41:20] who's going to bring forth the Life of
[1:41:22] Christ
[1:41:24] right is that what the angel came to do
[1:41:27] these three men
[1:41:28] came to give Abraham and Sarah a word
[1:41:32] came to give Sarah a strength
[1:41:34] that word strength means power to
[1:41:36] conceive and bring forth the promised
[1:41:39] untrue she starts to believe things
[1:41:41] about herself that she thought
[1:41:42] impossible
[1:41:45] now no other message on the face of the
[1:41:47] Earth has the power to produce this
[1:41:51] and bring the promise to pass in your
[1:41:53] life but the message of the hour give
[1:41:56] God a great type of praise
[1:42:00] to pray to power is in US amen let's
[1:42:02] Stand Together Hallelujah
[1:42:05] praise the Lord
[1:42:08] I have creative power in me now
[1:42:14] not tomorrow
[1:42:16] not yesterday
[1:42:19] is Hebrews 13 8. amen and even now
[1:42:22] whatsoever you desire you can have it
[1:42:26] if you can believe some of you will be
[1:42:28] walking out of your new organs
[1:42:33] thank you if you can't believe right now
[1:42:35] you'll be walking out of here with
[1:42:37] answered prayers yes
[1:42:39] yes amen
[1:42:40] praise the Lord
[1:42:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:47] the Lord wants to do it for you
[1:42:50] but you've got to raise up now and the
[1:42:52] first thing we want to do
[1:42:54] if we've learned anything this morning
[1:42:56] his first approach it the right way
[1:42:58] let's get rid of all sin all unbelief
[1:43:01] let's bring it under the blood first
[1:43:05] then let's pray for
[1:43:08] into our in feeling of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:13] that Holy Spirit In You becomes creative
[1:43:15] power
[1:43:17] then you've got to feed on the word of
[1:43:18] God
[1:43:19] the Holy Spirit takes the promise of God
[1:43:21] that you're reading
[1:43:22] that you're believing for
[1:43:25] and it brings you to pass
[1:43:29] we read about
[1:43:30] how God created a hip bone for that boy
[1:43:34] we read about the withered hand
[1:43:38] there was a man who came to Jesus
[1:43:40] without eyeballs
[1:43:41] and Jesus Took mud and he created
[1:43:44] eyeballs for that man
[1:43:47] there was a girl that came to the
[1:43:48] prophet's meeting
[1:43:50] and she was blind yeah
[1:43:52] yeah and the prophet asked her what
[1:43:53] color eyes do you want
[1:44:00] you say brother you're not the prophet
[1:44:03] prophets are secondary
[1:44:05] hello
[1:44:07] the word is primary
[1:44:11] the Reason God sent a Divine gift is
[1:44:13] because people did not believe the Bible
[1:44:16] that stepped up in their own
[1:44:18] denominational Creeds and dogmas so God
[1:44:20] had to send this Vindicated gift amen
[1:44:23] God himself had to use his flesh
[1:44:26] instead of man revealing this son of man
[1:44:28] and he showed us how to operate the word
[1:44:31] when he spoke squirrels he was thinking
[1:44:33] about the word
[1:44:38] things out of the air he was thinking
[1:44:40] about the word
[1:44:43] amen praise the Lord
[1:44:47] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:49] praise the Lord amen you believe he's
[1:44:52] worthy of praise
[1:44:53] they believe he's worthy of honor yes
[1:44:55] amen

[1:45:01] I can pray over you
[1:45:03] but you've got to confess with your

[2:10:15] problems so
[2:10:17] A brotherhood
[2:10:19] nerve problem and never thought
[2:10:21] I mean you know brother Joshua is a man
[2:10:23] of faith but sometimes a mechanic you
[2:10:26] know mechanics car
[2:10:27] is probably the worst car
[2:10:30] he fixes everybody else's car
[2:10:32] so maybe he didn't think that he needs
[2:10:34] to pray away but then he has his wife
[2:10:37] and a family also says you've been
[2:10:39] complaining about that let me pray over
[2:10:40] it amen and I know brother Joshua was
[2:10:43] living off nerve medication I know
[2:10:45] because he gave me that nerve medication
[2:10:48] but my hand got sliced shut
[2:10:50] he gave me that for nerve pain
[2:10:53] so I remember he says I've got this I'm
[2:10:55] taking this

[2:12:19] it doesn't say the pastor believes we
[2:12:22] need to equip the church and get them to
[2:12:23] a place where they believe amen and they

[2:12:44] how the kingdom of God is manifest

[2:12:53] amen we've got to believe what we are
[2:12:56] preaching it must be backed up
[2:12:58] so even now some of you are going to
[2:13:00] come back with testimonies
[2:13:03] some of you are going to come back with
[2:13:04] testimony in fact already you can see
[2:13:06] the testimonies coming back

[2:13:42] quick uh meeting together on Zoom so we
[2:13:46] suggested Friday so if everybody is good
[2:13:48] with that day we'll have it at seven
[2:13:49] o'clock on Friday amen just get together
[2:13:53] amen when the world is trying to get a
[2:13:55] bit uh partying
[2:13:58] we'll party with the things of God
[2:14:00] amen amen but get involved with the
[2:14:02] things of God just Fellowship around the
[2:14:04] word we won't be like too long we'll see
[2:14:06] how the spirit leads amen we got
[2:14:08] testimonies the last time through the
[2:14:09] zoom call people were healed people were
[2:14:11] set free people were delivered
[2:14:13] so the power of God is moving
[2:14:15] depends are you willing to connect with
[2:14:17] the power of God Amen we have many other
[2:14:20] testimonies here and maybe we need to
[2:14:22] have a testimony night
[2:14:24] okay we need to have a testimony night
[2:14:29] amen but now if I say we're going to
[2:14:32] have it Wednesday
[2:14:35] you used to not come to church on the
[2:14:37] Wednesday right
[2:14:39] am I right
[2:14:42] shouldn't the Lord do a new thing here
[2:14:43] this morning
[2:14:44] in your posture you never used to come
[2:14:46] to church and the wind is dead
[2:14:48] so we can't have it anytime a testimony
[2:14:51] night
[2:14:52] you know I was getting testimony about
[2:14:54] the early Believers and I I remember
[2:14:56] this because I grew up in church and you
[2:14:58] couldn't stop the people from testifying
[2:15:00] they used to pop up
[2:15:02] and just like testify testify testify
[2:15:06] this that even if they found five grand
[2:15:08] on the ground and they were praying for
[2:15:09] they were coming in the front and say I
[2:15:11] thank you Lord I found this
[2:15:13] but they were grateful for all things
[2:15:16] amen
[2:15:17] I think too many times we don't give the
[2:15:19] Lord Praise we too shy
[2:15:22] amen God can't use as if we shall the
[2:15:25] reason he healed you of that thing the
[2:15:27] reason he delivered you of it is for you
[2:15:28] to testify amen because your testimony
[2:15:31] can influence and change the life of
[2:15:33] others so if somebody else is sick and
[2:15:35] say the Lord Heal Me it can heal you but
[2:15:38] now I also want to tell you this quickly
[2:15:40] don't just give us a random prayer
[2:15:42] request
[2:15:43] everyone who got healed came to Jesus
[2:15:45] personally
[2:15:47] or they had somebody who came right
[2:15:50] they brought the man on that stretcher
[2:15:52] into the presence of Jesus so somebody
[2:15:54] wants healing don't just think God's
[2:15:57] good they must be hungry for God
[2:16:01] in church
[2:16:05] you know why they want to use God for
[2:16:06] the benefits oh I want my healing but
[2:16:08] then they go on living their life of sin
[2:16:11] they want to be used God is now
[2:16:14] like a lucky charm no you tell them God
[2:16:17] can deliver you God can change you
[2:16:18] without God can give you a job but come
[2:16:21] to church hear the word of God
[2:16:24] amen God bless you amen we'll meet again
[2:16:27] on Wednesday Hallelujah
