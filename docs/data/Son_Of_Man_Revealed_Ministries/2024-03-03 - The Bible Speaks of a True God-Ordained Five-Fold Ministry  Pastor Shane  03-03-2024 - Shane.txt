Faith amen hallelujah rapturing faith lies in the message amen amen and it will take the spirit of almighty God to express rapturing Faith with a belief that has been expressed from the help desk of God in a fold Ministry amen amen yes Hallelujah can you say amen amen brother BL MOS the fivefold ministry according to the following sermons right it brings in uh Ephesians 4:11 he says now how could we turn one down and say the other one isn't so yes God does it himself amen so friends what I'm trying to tell you is this you never come by your own means yes you came in by the Divine blessings of God am amen and he wants to express himself in your life yes amen so the expression of himself in your life and in my life will come to the Oneness of Christ yes amen amen let's go on now he says would the bride of Christ ever a Ministry before the Rapture sure that's what's going on right now Hallelujah so where do you think we are we are attaining rapturing faith by rapturing grace for a Rapture through the help desk of God to motivate our inner beings to a higher calling by divine grace and Order of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord certainly it is the message of the hour amen can you see now where we are it is the message of the hour yes we cannot compromise we cannot say it's this we cannot say it's that say what the tape says amen say what the spirit of God says say

intended the church to be run by men absolutely am hallelujah thank you Lord God runs his church and he runs it through gifts of the Spirit amen amen yes yes you got a person coming in here and he wants to Min Minister he picks up the gifts of the Spirit he preaches the word of God under the anointing and when he preaches under the anointing there's a conviction that comes within the confines of your spirit you let loose and let the Holy Ghost come in and take care of you amen take care of me yes praise the Lord there he says here the gift of the spirit is in the church to correct the spirit amen you see a lot of times we come in to the church and we feel that we are okay we can do this we can do that but what does God feel about our thoughts of expression towards our heart in the unveiling of a natural life within us to surpass that which God has ordained in the Supernatural can you say amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah he's got five ministri officers in the church amen come on say Amen why are you so quiet say amen amen praise the Lord y are not hungry yet you have breakfast amen praise the Lord the amen man within you correlates with the spirit that has been

daughter of God Amen praise the Lord amen the gifts of the Spirit is in the church to correct the spirit he's got five ministerial opposes in his church first of them is Apostles missionaries missionary is a highest calling there is then he says Apostle the word missionary means one cent amen apostal means one cent yes why they ever chose to be called missionary I don't know but they are Apostles amen yes all right Apostles Prophet teachers evangelist and pastors now that's the elected office of God to the church yes amen amen the reason why I said I I love to minister here is because because you know Pastor Ronnie and I we got on very well we express the word you know the way the word is we became very very friendly and expressed so much so that our love grew so much that we couldn't do without each other but circumstances is like as I was saying earlier on I was I was not well and all that I was just thinking wrong am I coming to meet you or what is the story you know but I'm preparing myself take it easy so there is a way that she must write unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death yes so now we got to be very goodful of our help desk our pulpits yes amen who comes who goes what they preach what they do they leave an anointing yes and the anointing gets you in the eye and the eye to the heart and from the heart the expression to your soul am amen it's either you you go by faith or you go by doubt yes amen praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah now we set in the church to keep the church in line with the word yes right now God has got an army you

yes don't you but the whole the holy spirit is there working through the Sanctified vessels amen amen hey wonderful amen working through the Sanctified vessels praise the Lord and God has set in the church what first apostles then prophets then teachers then evangelists then pastors is that right for the perfecting of the church amen God has did it it's not the preacher that preaches it's God preaching through him amen it's not the prophet that sees the vision it's God speaking through it amen amen okay so we we we we realize in our aspect of believing the word of the Lord the manner in which God expressed himself through a prophet and the prophet is the revealer of the Divine uh word of God yes his expression towards the word will be that of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen it's a gift a gift aims to take like a sword and go punch and Jab and po you see sometimes in our own human ability we possess a time frame of understanding that that person needs this that person needs that let me cut him up in pieces and whatsoever the Evangelist comes and do all those kind of things no our God is a good god amen amen right he may cat you the Holy Ghost will seow you up and give you divine will and order to surpass the things that you are going through let me tell you this you may be sitting here and listening to what the prophet I mean what the uh uh Minister

you call it your church absolutely somewhere you pay a tithes yes and somewh that you help support the cause amen hallelujah take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because it doesn't belong with your group yes can you say Amen to that amen I had a I had a group of people that came to the church and uh the brother testified and all those kind of things they were formerly from the local church where I live and he was going about trying to uh break the church and to make them this Fellowship the brother founded me and told me I said okay let's go through it let's pray and let's find out what is going on here he says no we want want uh our people to be set in the church not this church the church that they're going to have but believe me for what I say this brother moved on with another Pastor brother to come in to cause the problem that is it's just the work of the devil just the work of the devil and you must understand and know that where they come from they come from a place called The International trouble causes International trouble causes we don't want TR any trouble we want the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost will lead doesn't guide us now the same local church there was a brother from Richard's Bay that prayed for a family I'm just telling you this now don't disfellowship with one another cling on hold on to God's unchanging handall he came and he witnessed to this family and all that kind of thing he says no he brought them to our church he says don't worry they will be Fellowship Shing here uh at Stanger they live in Stanger they Fellowship in Stanger and all that suddenly he played another note and put them into the local assembly where I live in Tonga I still didn't matter because I had people that were living here that fellowshipping in Stanger but I put them onto that church to show them the goodness of God now there's somebody else that's are there the working took the nail to get that person to come on this side but all what I'm trying to say you is this get the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah if you got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will teach you to be approved Amen to be scriptural to understand the Bible and where to go from there amen okay the same local Minister got some uh what you call a prophet came to the church and start carrying on and whatever and the South African government bundled him off to where he comes from and now you see make your calling in your election show amen Hallelujah always pray about things and God will make a way for you yes never be discouraged okay amen praise the Lord then he says here now uh take your okay right take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group see discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in his heart am then you get it says then you got Fellowship one with another amen you are working for one great cause amen that's the cause of Christ I think that that is absolutely true wonderful thank you Lord can you can can you say Amen to that amen huh praise the Lord there is something about where you go yes what church you go to and what teacher teaches you amen what teacher

lives so that we will be able to manifest the scriptural manifestation of the word amen amen hallelujah praise praise the Lord amen praise the Lord now now you can see where we are what we are doing I hear your your messages uh when I'm home sometimes you know the ministers me ministering here and things like that it's very good it's very good they just don't take a book read the book and preach a book yes they search amen they find they give the feed the peace the appetite and the hunger of the of the spiritual Souls that's in this church amen to cause a pendulum to go left to right right to left in an hour where they'll take a decision to make them to feel that God is part of them yes amen give the ministers in this church ah hand come on I call them to to St it they don't want to come I don't know what that frighten okay anyway leave it God is in control I believe but I believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly yes Let each Church be its own amen yes choose its pastors its deacons it's whatever it is and then that way the man in there as no Bishop over him yes amen today what happens that guy will tell you this that guy will tell you that the Holy Spirit wants to speak something to that church so far we we went through there and we spoke about these things things and uh much more to it God s a prophet his name is William Mar and the prophet is God's time piece and L yes okay now we have one thing in common what is it pastor shamee rapur and fi I don't want to hear anything beside Jesus Christ and him being crucified am and in that crucifixion he illuminates you as a predestinated seed to succumb to the message of the hour amen and that's why we are so happy that that is why we are so pleased that is why we need Rapture in faith amen so now in the light of what has been said we must give God our undivided attention yes amen undivided attention to the word of God yes amen amen can you say amen amen our God is good amen our God is wonderful amen praise the Lord now how do we know whether we in the right track or not we will listen to this the mighty Angel brings down the open book upon the Earth yes amen hallelujah your names were written yes what

Valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil for with me I can go anywhere I can do whatever I want to do under the influence of the Holy Ghost nothing can get me out of the way the Lord thank you Lord blessed be amen praise the Lord you happy amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord in Revelation chapter 10 we didn't see a mighty angel carrying this open book yes upon the Earth this Mighty Angel delegated to the seventh angel of Revelation 107 to fulfill the final Commission of revealing the Mysteries contained in those Seven Seals upon God's people yes amen hallelujah hallelujah so we want to go there we must check what's going on here yes yes amen amen Revelation ch went to7 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open the book was open yes you can turn it to the page that you want in Revelation 10 1-7 and you can see your name written in there yeah your your name is not blocked out yes nobody can block it out Lord Glory the blood of Jesus Christ atoned made a way no Catalyst no nothing can take it away because you were for ordained of God Amen praise the Lord then he says here and he set his right foot upon the sea and his foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Ro it and when he had cried seven Thunders ated their voices so up to the voices yes praise the Lord voice say amen amen one voice voice say Amen speaks the same thing amen amen so there's no change of opinion with regards to the seven thunders of Revelation 10 1-7 amen one that walked in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks amen Jesus Christ when he came to Leia the Fulfillment was released because he had a bride that came from eternity to Earth and coming to Earth the bride needed certain foods yes to create an appetite within itself yes Amen to surpass the nutrients of the natural and cling on to the supernatural amen yes Hallelujah wonderful thank you Lord with the seven ters and under the voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven times is Ed and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that there in are the time shall be no longer right praise the Lord are you happy amen amen thank you Lord question number one every Bible question must have a Bible answer yes amen if

how many people were there what Mighty Angel and another Mighty another Mighty Angel then the angel was there we must be able to see the message from the scriptural point of view scriptural point of view we shouldn't take things lightly We Believe with the hope that God has chose us to give us this rapturing faith that we may one day our natural beings will perish and our Spiritual Beings will be caught up to meet him in the amen you can have all the food in life make you fat make you big make you this make you that okay but we need spiritual food you SE Hallelujah in a season that God has
