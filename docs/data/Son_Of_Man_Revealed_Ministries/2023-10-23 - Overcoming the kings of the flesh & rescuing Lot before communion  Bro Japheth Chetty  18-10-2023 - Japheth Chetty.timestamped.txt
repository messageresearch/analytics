[0:00] hallelujah amen let's stand even as we
[0:02] read the
[0:03] word now Pastor said that the Bri as one
[0:08] objective one Ministry and that's to
[0:11] slay amen every enemy every demonic
[0:14] power yes amen and that's a portion of
[0:17] what we're going to be talking on
[0:19] tonight amen let's go to Genesis chapter
[0:22] 14 and we start reading from verse
[0:28] one
[0:32] and it came to pass in the days of amrel
[0:35] king of
[0:36] Shah AR king of Alysa shaloma King ofam
[0:42] and tidal king of Nations that these
[0:44] made war with barah king of Sodom and
[0:47] with Bersa king of gomorah shanab king
[0:50] of adma and Shah king of Zabo and the
[0:54] king of ba which is zor all these were
[0:57] joined together in the veil of sidm sidm
[1:00] or in other words the valley of sadm
[1:03] Amen which is the salt sea 12 years they
[1:06] serve Chala in the 13th year they
[1:10] rebelled and in the 14th year came tooma
[1:14] and the kings that were with him and
[1:16] smokee the
[1:17] refs in ashtar KH and the zams in ham
[1:23] and IMS in shave y these are some really
[1:26] hectic names and the horites in their MS
[1:30] unto AAR which is by the Wilderness amen
[1:34] so these kings came and they started to
[1:36] Smite these other nations amen and keep
[1:39] in mind the red horse rider amen who was
[1:41] there to Smite the people amen with the
[1:43] red Power going forth with the
[1:47] sword verse 7 and they returned and came
[1:50] to in mishpat which is which is kades
[1:53] and smot all the country of the
[1:55] amalekites and also the amorites and
[1:58] dwelt in Hason more and there went out
[2:02] the king of Sodom and the king of
[2:04] gomorra and the king of adma and the
[2:06] king of zom and the king of Bella and
[2:09] they joined battle with them in the veil
[2:11] of sidim with shaloma the king of ilam
[2:15] and with tidle king of Nations and Amel
[2:18] king of Shah and ARA king of Alysa Four
[2:22] Kings with five so basically they were
[2:24] the Four Kings amen that we mentioned in
[2:27] the first portion of the verse against
[2:30] these five
[2:31] Kings and one of the five Kings or two
[2:34] of the five Kings were Sodom the king of
[2:36] Sodom and the king of Gomorrah so we
[2:38] know that this is how lot was involved
[2:40] because lot was with Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:43] yes so verse 10 and the veil of sadum
[2:46] was full of slim puts amen and the kings
[2:51] of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell
[2:53] there you see in these places out in the
[2:55] world and the denominations they are
[2:57] full of slime puts amen and this is
[2:59] where the kings of Sodom and gomorra
[3:01] fell down in the slets in these slets of
[3:04] these denominations and Creeds and
[3:07] dogmas and all of these things this is
[3:09] where they fell and they were taken
[3:12] over and they remained fled to the
[3:14] mountain and they took all the goods of
[3:17] Sodom and gomorah and all their victuals
[3:19] now victuals talks about
[3:21] food and went their way so you see first
[3:24] they started smiting the people with
[3:26] sword which is your red horse rider and
[3:29] now they started to take away their
[3:30] goods and their vual which is talking
[3:32] about the third horse rider amen and
[3:35] they took lot Abram's son now notice
[3:38] Abraham's name is Abram his name had not
[3:40] changed as yet who dwelt in Sodom and
[3:43] his goods and departed verse 13 and
[3:47] there came one that had escaped and told
[3:49] Abram the he the Hebrew for he dwelt in
[3:52] the plain of mamre now mamre we know one
[3:55] of the meanings of mamre is a place of
[3:57] strength a place of fatness am amen
[3:59] Abraham was not living in a place of
[4:01] weakness amen Abraham was living in a
[4:04] place of Plenty Amen in a place of
[4:06] fatness why because he had spiritual
[4:08] food in je season am he was not in
[4:11] hunger amen he was not affected by the
[4:13] third horse power amen but he had
[4:16] plentiful Amen in the plain of mam the
[4:19] Amorite brother of ishk and brother of
[4:23] Ana and these were Confederate with
[4:26] Abram yes amen Abraham was not alone
[4:28] amen yeah and when Abraham heard that
[4:31] his brother was taken captive he armed
[4:34] his trained servants born in his own
[4:36] house amen these were servants that were
[4:39] born in the household of Abraham they
[4:42] were a part of Abraham's promise because
[4:44] Abraham and his household yes amen so
[4:47] these were trained servants in the house
[4:48] of Abraham
[4:51] 318 and pursued them unto Dan amen now
[4:54] we know what Dan is typing and we're
[4:56] going to come back to that am and he
[4:58] divided himself against against them and
[5:00] his servants by night and smoke them and
[5:02] pursued them unto hobah which is on the
[5:05] left hand of Damascus and he brought
[5:08] back all the goods and also brought
[5:10] again his brother lot and his goods and
[5:13] the woman also and the people so he
[5:15] never just rescued lot he also rescued
[5:18] the people of Sodom and gorah and and
[5:20] the neighboring
[5:23] vicinities verse 17 and the king of
[5:25] Sodom went out to meet him after his
[5:27] return from the slaughter of Thea and
[5:30] the and of the kings that were with him
[5:32] at the valley of sh which is the King's
[5:35] Dale amen and mzc king of Salem brought
[5:39] forth Bread and Wine and he was the
[5:41] priest of the most high God Amen and he
[5:44] blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of
[5:46] the most high god possessor of Heaven
[5:49] and Earth amen and blessed be the most
[5:51] high God which had delivered thine
[5:53] enemies into thine hand and he gave him
[5:57] tithes of all and the king of Sodom
[6:00] said unto Abram give me the persons and
[6:03] take so the persons that Abram had
[6:04] rescued now and take the goods to
[6:06] thyself and Abram said to the king of
[6:09] Sodom I have lift up my hand unto the
[6:11] Lord the most high God the possessor of
[6:14] Heaven and Earth that I will not take
[6:16] from a thread even to a shoe latchet and
[6:19] that I will not take anything that is
[6:21] thine lest thou should say I have made
[6:23] Abraham Rich save only that which the
[6:26] young man have eaten and the portion of
[6:28] men which went with me amen so Abraham
[6:31] does not want the testimony to be that
[6:34] you have made me Rich amen he does not
[6:36] want amen the testimony that the
[6:38] heathens have made me Rich amen because
[6:41] Abraham had his trust and faith in God
[6:43] Amen he knew that he was a possessor of
[6:45] all things if you read amen verse 19
[6:49] meaz is saying to Abraham Blessed Be
[6:52] Abraham of the most high god possessor
[6:55] of Heaven and Earth and this was before
[6:57] his name was even changed am amen but
[6:59] already he was predestinated to be the
[7:02] possessor of Heaven and Earth amen
[7:04] hallelujah talking about predestination
[7:07] before we can even have a change God had
[7:09] already predestinated what we should be
[7:12] amen that we should be possessor of all
[7:14] things amen you may be seated may God
[7:17] add blessing to the reading of his word
[7:20] amen I think I would I'd rather change
[7:22] back to that mic to avoid the
[7:28] feedback
[7:42] amen so here we see that there's this
[7:46] battle that is going on and Abraham here
[7:50] is going to fight this battle not on his
[7:52] own behalf only but on behalf of his
[7:56] blood rela of lot yes and ab
[8:00] takes trained soldiers or not sorry not
[8:02] soldiers but trained servants from his
[8:04] own
[8:05] household
[8:07] now for tonight for a thought what we
[8:09] want to speak on is overcoming the kings
[8:12] of the Flesh and the powers of the four
[8:15] horse riders and rescuing Lord before
[8:19] communion amen so our emphasis tonight
[8:22] is going to be on a very simple topic
[8:23] amen it's very much based on saving the
[8:26] lost and US overcoming the Flesh and
[8:29] overcoming the powers that are riding in
[8:31] this end time amen so we see that there
[8:37] are four Kings here now that are Waging
[8:40] War against this other group of five
[8:42] Kings and if we look at the names of
[8:45] these Kings if you could just scroll
[8:49] down stop
[8:52] there just to show you that lot and his
[8:56] people were not just captured by just
[8:59] you know ordinary Kings and we think
[9:00] that this was just a normal battle going
[9:02] on if we look at the first name
[9:06] Amel Amel the meaning of the word
[9:13] Amel it means the Sayer of Darkness fall
[9:17] of the Sayer one that speaks Secrets
[9:21] keeper of gods keeper of treasures or
[9:25] speaker of mysteries the enlightener of
[9:28] secret
[9:30] now does this not remind you of the
[9:31] first horse rider who rode out in
[9:34] deception in the first age amen the SE
[9:38] of Darkness it began as a few Deeds of
[9:41] the nians but then it began to become a
[9:44] Doctrine amen amen a doctrine that
[9:46] started to go on and what was the
[9:48] doctrine it was say SS of Darkness amen
[9:52] it was these secret Mysteries that Satan
[9:54] was trying to infiltrate the church with
[9:57] yes so here now here is this King amraa
[10:01] now we just read the passage and you'll
[10:03] knowe that this W was actually the W of
[10:07] choma but when the Bible lists the names
[10:10] of the Kings it does not list Chala as
[10:14] the first king it list Amel as the first
[10:17] king and you're going to see that God
[10:19] does not do things just haphazardly he
[10:22] writes things in the Bible for a certain
[10:24] reason amen God works in a certain order
[10:27] and he's in his mathematics and his
[10:28] Bible perfect amen amen and you'll see
[10:31] that just now so here was the first king
[10:33] and his name means say of Darkness amen
[10:36] type in the first horse rider who rode
[10:38] out in
[10:39] deception then the second king is arok
[10:42] and arok means tall great and long and
[10:47] we know that the second horse rider who
[10:49] rode out and we even read in the passage
[10:51] that how they began to Smite the people
[10:53] we know that the second horse rider
[10:55] began to persecute the church amen and
[10:58] it it was an age of Darkness amen the
[11:01] church ages began to go in the ages of
[11:04] darkness which was some of the longest
[11:06] Church
[11:06] ages amen and AR means tall great and
[11:10] long amen it was some of the longest
[11:12] Church ages in the Dark Ages
[11:15] yeah now look at the Third King which is
[11:17] Chom remember I said the W was actually
[11:20] his W but God listed him as the third
[11:23] King and choma means a sheep band or a
[11:28] handful of sheep
[11:30] and do that ring a bell now if you look
[11:32] at Revelation 6 amen when Bible is
[11:35] talking about the
[11:37] third uh the third seal Revelation 6:5
[11:42] he says and when he had opened the third
[11:44] seal I heard the third Beast say come
[11:46] and see and I beheld and L a black horse
[11:49] and he that sat on him had a pair of
[11:51] balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice
[11:54] in the midst of the four Beast say a
[11:55] measure of wheat for a penny and three
[11:59] measures of Bali for a penny now a
[12:01] bundle of sheeps adds up to
[12:04] Bali and here the third horse rider is
[12:07] saying a measure of wheat for a penny
[12:10] and three measures of Bary for a penny
[12:12] and see thou hurt not the oil and wine
[12:14] so here we got the Third King whose name
[12:16] means the Sheep type in the third horse
[12:19] rider now you see why God never list him
[12:21] as the first king even though it was his
[12:23] war God made sure to list him as the
[12:25] third King amen because his name ties in
[12:28] with the third horse rider hallelujah
[12:31] amen now here comes the fourth King
[12:33] which is
[12:35] title and title in the Bible calls him
[12:37] the king of Nations amen now here's the
[12:40] fourth horse rider who is the king of
[12:43] Nations oh yes amen and we know that
[12:46] this four fourth horse rider is so
[12:48] powerful that he's got every nation
[12:50] under this world under his control amen
[12:54] amen and in which age came the United
[12:57] Nations amen it's all in in this age
[12:59] where the fourth horse rider is riding
[13:01] amen the other meaning for title is
[13:04] knowledge of elevation Amen in an age
[13:07] where knowledge has increased yes in an
[13:09] age of great infrastructure and the
[13:11] signs behind the knowledge of elevation
[13:14] amen the fourth horse rider is riding
[13:16] amen amen so you see that this Four
[13:19] Kings now are typing your four powers
[13:22] yes and notice that Chala could not
[13:24] fight the battle himself because all
[13:27] along choma was raining according to
[13:30] what we just read yes but there came a
[13:32] time where the Bible says the people
[13:35] rebelled against shaloma the third
[13:38] horsepower
[13:39] right and so he then United the ask the
[13:44] other three kings to join him and they
[13:45] all remember all three powers unite and
[13:48] become the fourth power amen
[13:51] amen
[13:53] so we look at in what age a man did the
[13:57] anointing of the man go out to combat
[13:59] the third horse rider amen it's where in
[14:02] the age of Martin Luther when they
[14:04] started to rebel against the Catholic
[14:06] church amen men like okay you can just
[14:09] pause there because I believe they want
[14:11] a
[14:12] transition
[14:16] amen amen let's just sing A Chorus in
[14:18] the meantime when the batt
[14:22] over we shall wear a
[14:25] crown we shall wear a crown we shall we
[14:31] Crown when the
[14:33] batt we shall Crown in the new
[14:41] jerus
[14:43] [Music]
[14:46] we we'll we a bright and
[14:50] [Music]
[14:53] Shining when the battle's over we shall
[14:57] wear a
[15:02] in
[15:06] again we shall wear a
[15:09] crown we shall wear a crown oh we shall
[15:14] wear a
[15:15] crown
[15:17] batt
[15:19] we
[15:21] in
[15:24] Jerusalem we we a
[15:27] crown
[15:30] we we wear a bright and
[15:37] shineing when the battle's over we
[15:42] shall in
[15:44] that
[15:48] jerus thank you Lord amen
[15:57] amen
[16:01] so I was saying that remember they
[16:03] started to rebel against this third
[16:05] power to Thea right amen and in which
[16:09] age did they start to contest the
[16:10] Catholic church was in the age of Martin
[16:12] Luther which was the third power which
[16:15] was the power of a man going to combat
[16:17] the third power of the enemy which was
[16:19] the third horse rider so that is why in
[16:22] the age of choma they started to rebel
[16:24] against him and now because choma saw
[16:28] that they started to rebel against him
[16:30] he now needed the power of the other
[16:33] horse riders to combine together to make
[16:35] the fourth horse rider Amen to go after
[16:38] these people yes amen so we see now that
[16:42] this is not just a normal walk but this
[16:44] is typ in how these Powers amen have
[16:48] gotten the world in such a state they've
[16:50] captured the church World they've
[16:51] captured amen the the people of the age
[16:54] of lateria they've captured our family
[16:56] they've captured our loved ones
[16:59] all in this on these powers of the four
[17:01] horse riders combined they've captured
[17:03] them but one person was not bound by the
[17:06] power and there was Abraham amen Abraham
[17:09] was in memory in the place of strength
[17:11] Amen in a place of plentiful he was not
[17:14] affected by the first SSE Rider he was
[17:17] not deceived amen because when he saw
[17:20] amen the angel of the Lord coming He Saw
[17:22] Three Angels coming but he said my Lord
[17:24] he had a revelation so he was not
[17:26] deceived amen amen amen he was not
[17:30] smoked with sword by the second H power
[17:32] amen he is
[17:34] Victorious amen he was not lacking he
[17:37] was not affected by the third hor power
[17:39] he was he had plentiful he was blessed
[17:42] amen amen neither was he affected by the
[17:44] force horse rider which was death
[17:46] because Abraham had a body change yes
[17:49] amen he is able Amen to surpass that yes
[17:53] but here was his family lot amen that
[17:56] was captured by these powers
[18:01] amen and notice that Abraham pursued
[18:04] them unto Dan now we know Dan types the
[18:07] eagle yes and in Dan Abraham gave them a
[18:09] good hiding amen amen because under the
[18:13] anointing of the eagle amen there's no
[18:15] demon power that can Prevail amen under
[18:18] the evil anointing Abraham was able to
[18:21] combat the enemy and was able to defeat
[18:24] them amen and we under the eagle
[18:26] anointing there is no power of death
[18:28] that can come here and take us captive
[18:31] amen amen there's such an anointing over
[18:33] here amen that when death comes knocking
[18:35] at the door it just passes by because
[18:38] there's blood on the door amen there's
[18:40] blood on the door post there's the token
[18:42] applied amen so Abraham came to the
[18:45] place called Dan he chased them till Dan
[18:47] and he began to overcome them there and
[18:49] he began to to defeat them there and
[18:52] then he went on from Dan he went on to a
[18:54] place called habah which means the place
[18:56] of fear of death or hiding and defeated
[19:00] them there so Abraham defeated the power
[19:02] of death which was these four hor Riders
[19:04] combined now defeated them in the place
[19:07] of habah which is the place of death and
[19:10] hiding amen so you see it's not just a
[19:13] normal story of Abraham going to war
[19:15] with these people but there was
[19:17] spiritual uh amen wickedness in high
[19:20] places that were involved here and we
[19:22] know that we are not Waring against the
[19:24] flesh but amen we war against spiritual
[19:28] d
[19:28] principalities in high places amen that
[19:31] is why the seals were open to us so that
[19:34] we can see what we are up against am
[19:37] amen when you go through trials amen and
[19:39] we see things happening in the world we
[19:41] don't just see them as natural events
[19:43] but we see Satan's power that is amen
[19:46] going throughout the whole world killing
[19:48] stealing destroying we saw that in cover
[19:51] we know that the fourth fourth horse
[19:53] rider was death amen and took the third
[19:55] parts of the Earth with him and many
[19:58] other amen not just Co but many other
[20:00] diseases sickness plagues Wars amen all
[20:04] of these things that Satan is writing
[20:06] under but the seals come to open our
[20:09] eyes to that so that we can see how God
[20:11] is moving amen yes amen hallelujah amen
[20:14] so we are talking about today overcoming
[20:16] amen these four horse powers overcoming
[20:19] the kings of the flesh yes and rescuing
[20:22] Lord before
[20:23] communion amen before amen we need to
[20:28] first defeat amen these powers like
[20:30] Abraham and these Kings amen before we
[20:34] meet mezc and have communion with him
[20:37] amen like I said we wrestle not against
[20:40] flesh and blood but there's demon powers
[20:43] yes and war against us amen and
[20:46] sometimes when they can't attack us
[20:48] because the anointing is so strong they
[20:50] will go after our loved ones amen
[20:52] because why they know if they can
[20:54] capture your loved ones in sickness or
[20:56] in the world or in sin
[20:58] then there's the five senses in you
[21:00] because you start you got five senses In
[21:02] the Flesh and five senses Amen in your
[21:04] spirit and you start to feel sorry for
[21:06] them you start to feel burdened for them
[21:08] you start to feel heavy in your spirit
[21:10] when the enemy has them amen trapped so
[21:13] the enemy knows how to get to us and he
[21:16] knew how to get to Abraham amen by
[21:19] capturing
[21:22] lot now we know who was mzc and just for
[21:27] the purpose of the recording in am man
[21:28] so anyone might be watching or maybe the
[21:30] younger people who might not know we
[21:32] know meaz to be Jesus because the
[21:35] prophet that he was God and mor God
[21:38] changing Mass amen from Spirit to word
[21:42] and mzc was the theophany of God Amen
[21:45] and from theophany then became flesh in
[21:48] Jesus
[21:49] Christ so we know that this is why Jesus
[21:52] knew all
[21:54] things now we come the opposite way we
[21:56] come from flesh to word amen but Jesus
[22:00] come from word to flesh so he could
[22:03] comprehend all things we cannot
[22:05] comprehend all things because of that
[22:08] and the prophet goes on to say and we've
[22:09] got the quote there now the difference
[22:12] between him MDC and you as a son he was
[22:17] at the beginning the word and end Mor a
[22:19] body amen I know you know these things
[22:22] but just for someone who might be
[22:23] watching amen the recording he came in
[22:26] and lived in that in the person of MDC
[22:29] then later we never heard no more of MDC
[22:32] because he became Jesus Christ Prophet
[22:34] said it now that settles it amen amen
[22:37] that's one of the things that can settle
[22:38] the tuna's doctrine hallelujah amen MDC
[22:42] was the priest but he became Jesus
[22:45] Christ now you bypass that because in
[22:48] that form he knowed all things and you
[22:50] have never been able to know that yet
[22:53] amen notice he said you'll never been
[22:54] able to know that yet yeah you come like
[22:57] Adam like like me you became from the
[22:59] attribute to the flesh to be tempted and
[23:02] what he's saying is you came from the
[23:03] attribute of God which was in God's
[23:05] thoughts to
[23:06] flesh to be tempted but when this life
[23:09] is finished here if this Earthly
[23:11] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[23:14] already waiting that's where we go that
[23:17] is the word then we can look back and
[23:19] see what we've done now we don't
[23:22] understand it we have never become the
[23:23] word we've just become the flesh man not
[23:26] the word amen the prophet goes on to say
[23:29] but and look clearly makes it clear you
[23:32] will never be the word unless you are a
[23:34] thought at the beginning yes amen you
[23:36] have to come from the attributes of God
[23:38] we know that that proves the
[23:40] predestination of God see you can't be
[23:42] the word unless you are thought you had
[23:45] to be in the thinking first amen but you
[23:48] bypass the theop and become flesh man to
[23:50] be tempted in sin and then if this
[23:53] Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have
[23:55] all we have one already waiting amen we
[23:58] have not yet the bodies but look when
[24:01] this body receives the spirit of God the
[24:03] Holy Spirit The Immortal Life inside of
[24:06] you that you might not have your your
[24:08] word body yet your body yet but when the
[24:11] spirit lives inside of you it throws
[24:14] this flesh body in subjection to God yes
[24:17] amen so we can't make the excuse that
[24:19] say oh we living in the flesh body so
[24:20] that is why we subject to sin all the
[24:22] time because when the Holy Spirit comes
[24:24] in you The Immortal Life Of God it
[24:26] throws this body into subjection to God
[24:30] Amen he that's born of God does not
[24:32] commit sin yes amen he cannot sin Romans
[24:36] 8:1 there is therefore now no
[24:38] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[24:40] Jesus they walk not after the flesh but
[24:43] after the spirit amen so we can't use
[24:46] that as an excuse to say we haven't been
[24:48] in our theop body as
[24:50] yet God and mor masked in the pillar of
[24:53] fire god and mor in a man called Jesus
[24:57] God and M in his church amen so that is
[25:00] why amen the Church of God is regarded
[25:03] very highly because it's God and mor in
[25:05] the church amen hallelujah just God
[25:08] changing mask amen so you don't just
[25:10] look at the female portion as a separate
[25:13] entity amen but it's God in Mor yes God
[25:17] above us God With Us amen the
[25:20] condescending of
[25:21] God so we know who mdic was amen and
[25:25] here he's bringing communion to Abram
[25:28] right after the victory of slaughtering
[25:30] the Kings and rescuing lot now Jesus
[25:34] said in Matthew chap 26 and verse 29 but
[25:37] I say unto you I will not drink of this
[25:39] fruit of the vine from now until that
[25:41] day when I drink it a new with you in my
[25:44] father's Kingdom so we've gathered that
[25:47] mzc is Jesus and mzc is serving
[25:50] communion to Abram but only after
[25:53] Abraham defeats these Powers yes amen
[25:56] amen and Jesus has given us that promise
[25:59] to say that we also will drink of the
[26:01] fruit of the Vine with him a new in his
[26:04] father's Kingdom but before we get there
[26:06] we have to overcome the flesh yes and
[26:09] before we get there we have to overcome
[26:11] the four horse powers amen Satan's power
[26:15] in the end time and before we go there
[26:18] not only do we have to overcome them but
[26:20] we have to rescue amen the Lost which is
[26:23] our loved ones which is
[26:25] lot and in this time
[26:29] amen we see that the the prophet says
[26:31] now communion think of that part of
[26:33] himself now we want to see in type in
[26:37] view the communion after the battle he
[26:39] gave of himself because the communion is
[26:42] part of Christ amen and after the
[26:45] struggle is over after you've done got
[26:47] yourself whooped out then is when
[26:50] meaning you whoop out the flesh now
[26:51] after you crucify the flesh then is when
[26:55] you partake of Christ and become part of
[26:58] his being and the prophet says you get
[27:00] it but MDC after his child Abraham had
[27:04] won the victory MDC met him and gave him
[27:07] wine and bread showing that after this
[27:09] Earthly battle is over we will meet him
[27:12] in the heavens and take the communion
[27:14] again so you see I'm getting it from the
[27:16] prophet it'll be the wedding supper I
[27:19] will not drink no more of the vine or
[27:21] eat the fruit until I eat it and drink
[27:24] it with you and new in my father's
[27:26] Kingdom thank you amen so you see before
[27:28] we get there what we have to do now we
[27:30] have to overcome these
[27:32] things
[27:34] amen now notice that lot was a close
[27:37] blood relative of Abram he has family
[27:40] amen blood
[27:42] relatives and lot had some form of
[27:44] righteousness we know that because the
[27:46] Bible says that his righteous Soul was
[27:48] vexed Amen in Sodom so he had some form
[27:51] of righteousness amen amen the only
[27:53] problem is they have righteousness but
[27:55] they deny the they have a form of godl
[27:57] but they deny the power thereof amen you
[28:00] see they have a form of godliness so so
[28:02] notice that lot was not a message
[28:04] believer he was just blood relation to
[28:07] Abram and he believed in God so he was a
[28:10] nominal Christian so to speak or we can
[28:13] say he as a denominational Christian
[28:16] amen we see lot believed in a tuna's
[28:18] Doctrine because when he saw the two
[28:20] Angel he said my lords he do not have a
[28:22] revelation of the one God Amen so
[28:25] definitely he was not a message believer
[28:28] amen you look at Lot's wife they were
[28:31] easily influenced by Sodom and Gomorrah
[28:34] the prophet you know when he's
[28:35] dramatizing Lot's wife and he says you
[28:37] know Sarah was a bit despondent because
[28:40] she saw how Lot's wife had the latest
[28:42] fashions of the day amen you know Lot's
[28:44] wife began to Fashion herself after
[28:46] Sodom and
[28:47] gomorah amen so these were not message
[28:49] Believers what I'm trying to show to you
[28:52] is that lot was a nominal Christian was
[28:54] a nominal Church goer just in any
[28:56] denomination
[28:59] yeah you see lot believed in the message
[29:02] of people the likes of bully gram and or
[29:05] Roberts amen those were the messages
[29:08] that he believed and The Offspring of
[29:10] those Ministries which is every modern T
[29:13] evangelist you see where lot is
[29:16] now
[29:17] amen lot did not have a visitation of
[29:20] the mighty Angel amen right amen amen he
[29:23] had a visitation of angels but he did
[29:25] not have a visitation of the Mighty
[29:27] Angel amen yes Lord amen because the
[29:30] mighty angel came to Abraham and Abraham
[29:32] called him my Lord and Abraham called
[29:35] him Elohim amen Abraham had a revelation
[29:39] of who he
[29:41] was amen amen and the sign of the
[29:45] Discerning of the hearts was performed
[29:47] to Abraham and his group his family yes
[29:50] Lord did not have that yes in fact the
[29:52] sign that lot had was the SM smiting of
[29:55] blindness yes amen yes amen so we can we
[30:00] can conclude Lord was not even a
[30:02] bachelor and message believer you know
[30:05] he was a nominal Christian
[30:09] yes yet though he was a nominal
[30:12] Christian though he was a denominational
[30:14] person though he did not recognize his
[30:17] day and his
[30:18] message Abraham who was the call of God
[30:21] who was the predestinated who accepted
[30:23] the message of the mighty
[30:26] Angel and amen when he saw lot in this
[30:29] condition Abraham began to get into
[30:32] action because this was his close blood
[30:35] relative he began to get troubled in his
[30:37] heart like I said the enemy knows how to
[30:39] get to you amen amen if he can't get to
[30:43] you put a sickness upon your family
[30:46] member amen now Abraham did not have an
[30:50] attitude of condemnation towards lot now
[30:53] notice Abraham could have said you know
[30:56] lot has always giving me problems when
[30:58] he was with me he gave me problems I
[31:01] gave him the to choose whatever portion
[31:03] he wants he chose Sodom and gorrow now
[31:06] he's landed himself in problems again he
[31:08] didn't want to accept the the message
[31:11] that I was trying to give him he didn't
[31:14] want to listen to me yes and now he's
[31:18] captured because Sodom and gomorra got
[31:20] captured lot got captured together with
[31:22] his family and neighbors and everyone
[31:24] else but Abraham did not have that
[31:26] Abraham did not have a superiority
[31:30] complex amen he never begin to say I am
[31:32] the father of many nations amen I am the
[31:35] promis seed amen and the message of the
[31:37] hour is only for
[31:39] me now notice Abraham yes he did
[31:43] separate himself from unbelief he
[31:45] separated himself from lot you know
[31:47] Abraham didn't go down and join lot in
[31:49] all of his you know festivities in Sodom
[31:52] and Gomorrah never go down amen and have
[31:55] a whole party with his family L he never
[31:58] get involved in all of those things he
[32:00] was totally separated amen because we
[32:02] know that God calls for total separation
[32:04] from unbelief
[32:08] amen but when lot needed saving though
[32:11] he separated himself but when lot needed
[32:13] saving Abraham gathered men trained in
[32:17] his own household amen men that were
[32:19] trained in the gospel men that were
[32:22] trained in the message of the hour
[32:24] believe in Abraham's
[32:26] message amen Abraham had a message that
[32:28] he heard from the Lord yes and these
[32:31] were men trained in his household
[32:33] knowing that God speaks to Abraham they
[32:36] have confidence in Abraham because if
[32:38] they did not have confidence in Abraham
[32:40] why would servants go and fight a war
[32:43] remember they were grin up against Kings
[32:45] Kings have kingdoms and in those
[32:48] kingdoms they have soldiers who fight
[32:50] Wars amen Abraham had servants who were
[32:53] tendering the household tendering the
[32:55] yard tendering the Sheep
[32:58] so if they did not have confidence in
[32:59] Abraham they would not have gone to war
[33:02] but these were men who had confidence in
[33:03] the ministry amen amen they were trained
[33:07] in the household of Abraham trained in
[33:10] the word amen like we have been trained
[33:13] now for many years in the household of
[33:14] faith amen amen trained in the word amen
[33:19] we don't have training in the world but
[33:21] we were trained in the household of
[33:22] faith amen and how these servants were
[33:24] trained when they were looking after the
[33:26] Sheep Hallelujah amen hallelujah when
[33:28] they attending the Huds they begin to
[33:30] have training yes and so Abraham could
[33:33] take these men's down and say let's go
[33:35] and rescue
[33:37] Lots hallelujah amen and notice that
[33:41] they were not just trained men in the
[33:42] household but they were part of the
[33:44] promise because it's Abraham and his
[33:46] household was blessed yes the promise
[33:49] was for Abraham and his household notice
[33:51] even when Abraham had no seed as yet
[33:54] that Ela was going to inherit the
[33:55] inheritance yeah now Ela was just a
[33:59] servant so these were servants but they
[34:01] were blessed in the household of Abraham
[34:05] yes now Abraham could have said you see
[34:08] lot I want you not to go down there to
[34:10] that wretched place of Sodom and
[34:13] Gomorrah you
[34:14] know now you paying the price for what
[34:17] you did it's your decision you paying
[34:18] the price of it he could have said that
[34:20] yes you know like how sometimes we say
[34:23] you know these people in the in the
[34:24] denomination they are digging their own
[34:26] Graves
[34:27] amen they chose to sit under those
[34:30] Ministries and now they are lost amen
[34:32] the Satan has taken a hold of
[34:35] them these this fourth horse rider which
[34:38] is a combination of the other horse
[34:40] riders have taken them
[34:42] captive you know we have excellent
[34:44] judges in our
[34:45] ranks you know sometimes in the message
[34:47] we can be excellent judges of
[34:50] people amen now you see you might say
[34:53] that you know yes we are judges because
[34:55] the Bible says the Saints are going to
[34:57] judge the Earth amen correct amen one
[35:01] day the Saints are going to judge the
[35:02] Earth but how many of you know what
[35:05] qualification it takes to be a
[35:09] judge so to be a judge is no different
[35:12] in the natural than my qualification
[35:14] which at the moment I'm an attorney to
[35:17] be a judge it requires the same degree
[35:19] that I have but it takes years of
[35:22] experience practicing either as an
[35:24] attorney or an advocate before become a
[35:27] judge when you're much older in age and
[35:29] you've practiced for years as an
[35:31] attorney or an advocate you can become a
[35:33] judge so you see before you become a
[35:38] judge you have to be an attorney or an
[35:40] advocate and what does an attorney and
[35:42] Advocate do he pleads the cases for the
[35:46] client amen so before you can judge the
[35:49] Earth you have to be able to plead the
[35:52] cases of the Lost amen you have to be
[35:55] able to plead the cases of your family
[35:57] of your loved
[35:58] ones amen you see before The Supreme
[36:02] judge of all the Earth in come in 1963
[36:05] he had to spend 2,000 years as an
[36:07] intercessory The Advocate who could
[36:09] plead our case amen before he can come
[36:12] as the Supreme judge of all the Earth
[36:14] thank but now we want to go straight to
[36:17] the position of Judge and start to judge
[36:19] amen look at these denomination
[36:22] people amen but we have to amen plead
[36:27] their case now good lawyer no matter how
[36:29] bad the case is he can find a way to
[36:32] plead a case amen he can find a way to
[36:35] plead a case for no matter how bad
[36:38] condition this accused is
[36:41] in amen so we got to be able to plead
[36:44] the case amen of the Lost before we can
[36:47] judge the
[36:50] earth now maybe you say maybe I'm off
[36:53] scripture but did not Abraham in another
[36:55] time when he was when Sodom and Gomorrah
[36:58] was going to be destroyed did not he
[36:59] become an advocate and start to plead
[37:02] for the mercy of Sodom and gomorah he
[37:04] began to plead with the angel and say if
[37:07] you can only find 10 will you not spare
[37:09] Sodom and
[37:11] Gomorrah you see Abraham was not just
[37:14] elevating himself to a position of Judge
[37:17] he began to become an advocate
[37:18] advocating for the people
[37:21] yeah that is why even though Abraham was
[37:23] a possessor of all things and he was
[37:25] heir to all things but he had a
[37:27] Christlike character about him amen he
[37:30] had a heart of souls amen and once again
[37:34] just like how before we commune with
[37:37] Jesus again in that Kingdom as I said we
[37:39] have to slay these powers and rescue
[37:43] amen our loved ones that are captured by
[37:46] these
[37:47] powers and now we know the prophet said
[37:50] that as she nears the head as the bride
[37:52] nears the head she'll be just like him
[37:55] amen amen so if we are to be just like
[37:58] him let's look at how Jesus was when he
[38:00] was here on the
[38:02] earth amen Jesus was known or should I
[38:05] say he was Notorious for going after the
[38:09] Lost amen he was highly criticized for
[38:13] having fellowship with Sinners and tax
[38:16] collectors look at those that were
[38:18] amongst these ranks
[38:21] adulterers
[38:23] amen and the Pharisees criticized him
[38:25] and questioned him for
[38:27] this but Jesus told him he that is whole
[38:30] need not a physician
[38:32] amen amen now in the same way in the
[38:35] message now it's almost as though we've
[38:38] created walls around us in the message
[38:41] and we've cut up everyone that is not in
[38:43] the message we've just cut them off and
[38:45] we've created these walls around
[38:47] us now remember in as much as the
[38:49] Pharisees and the organization types the
[38:52] denomination it's it's a compound
[38:53] meaning because you can have the
[38:55] Pharisee spirit in the message message
[38:56] as
[38:57] well amen if you think not ask yourself
[39:01] what was the main difference between
[39:03] Jesus and his group his disciples and
[39:05] the Pharisees and they group what was
[39:07] the main difference between them the
[39:09] Pharisees had the written law that came
[39:12] from a mighty Exodus Prophet where had
[39:14] the pillar of
[39:16] fire they claimed to be followers of
[39:18] Moses and the pillar of fire now can the
[39:21] denomination people say that they have a
[39:23] prophet with a p of fire they can't say
[39:25] that
[39:29] only messy people can say we have a
[39:30] prophet we have a we have the pull of
[39:32] fire we have the
[39:36] word so what was the difference then
[39:38] between Jesus and the Pharisees the
[39:41] Pharisees had the written law that was
[39:43] given by Moses but Jesus and his group
[39:46] was the same written law made manifest
[39:49] walking in
[39:50] flesh there was no difference in the
[39:52] word the written law that the Pharisees
[39:55] had was the same word in Jesus walking
[39:59] in flesh amen yes so there's the same
[40:02] word in the message but you can have a
[40:03] Pharisee spirit and say I have here's my
[40:06] spoken word book this was given to me by
[40:09] the prophet with a p of fire or you can
[40:13] be like Jesus and be the word made flesh
[40:16] walking and when you are the word made
[40:17] flesh you're so full of light that you
[40:20] can impart life unto the lost but if you
[40:23] don't have life in you then you cannot
[40:24] impart unto the Lost if the life is only
[40:27] here and not in you then you cannot
[40:30] impart and the Bible says the letter
[40:32] kill it but the spirit give it life am
[40:35] amen so amen we see that we can have a
[40:37] Pharisee spirit in the message and start
[40:39] to condemn those that have not received
[40:42] this message but look at Queen Esther
[40:45] now no one else could be Queen but
[40:48] Esther right her family could not be
[40:50] Queen only she alone could be Queen but
[40:53] she was preserved for such a time like
[40:55] this for the preservation of life to
[40:58] save her household to save her
[41:00] people so not everyone is meant to be
[41:03] Queen but why will we put in this
[41:05] position amen amen that's what we coming
[41:08] to tonight why will we put in this
[41:10] position amen hallelujah you blessed so
[41:13] far amen amen amen hallelujah Jesus said
[41:18] he that is whole need not a physician so
[41:20] how so we can say in the message now he
[41:22] that is whole need not a
[41:24] physician amen how many years have we
[41:26] been in the message now amen to say that
[41:29] we still need a physician now we've seen
[41:32] this year how the faith of each
[41:33] individual is rising up right you know
[41:37] we brother Adan and I was talking the
[41:39] other day and I was saying you know one
[41:40] of the highlights for me in these last
[41:42] few testimonies that that I was hearing
[41:44] is not just the supernatural but the
[41:47] fact that the people's Faith are being
[41:49] raised up that they are receiving it by
[41:52] faith it's not by anything we as a
[41:54] Ministry is doing but it's the faith
[41:57] level of the people that is rising up
[42:00] amen and they are beginning to catch it
[42:02] and take a hold of the promises of God
[42:04] is that correct you all heard the
[42:05] testimonies that have been going on
[42:08] which one of us went and can say that we
[42:09] went and did
[42:11] that so it's your own faith amen so ye
[42:15] that are whole need not a
[42:17] physician so if you do not need a
[42:20] physician we need to be out there amen
[42:23] imparting life to the Lost amen amen and
[42:25] we got scripture amen that's going to
[42:27] show us tonight amen I'm going to show
[42:29] you those scriptures and like the
[42:30] prophet said I can show you where God
[42:32] put those scriptures and you can show me
[42:34] where God took it out amen so we are
[42:37] there to impart
[42:39] life amen so how long can we keep the
[42:42] gospel to ourselves how long are we
[42:44] going to be selfish Amen in the message
[42:46] and just keep within our own confines
[42:49] amen that's right Amen in a time like
[42:51] this when you can see the Fig Tree is
[42:53] buing more and more amen how many
[42:56] seconds do we have left until our loved
[42:58] ones are left to perish notice I said
[43:01] seconds not hours not days seconds how
[43:03] much time we have left to witness to our
[43:05] loved ones yes amen until they are
[43:09] perished that's
[43:16] right amen do you know that in as much
[43:18] as each one will have to answer on the
[43:21] day for refusing the message we know
[43:23] that they will have to answer on that
[43:25] day if they' refused the message do you
[43:27] know that you will also be held
[43:29] accountable if you do not share the
[43:30] message because to whom much is given
[43:33] much is
[43:34] required now you remember the parable of
[43:38] the master who gave these dividends or
[43:40] Monies to the servants the three
[43:42] servants there were some servants that
[43:45] invested it and did all kinds of things
[43:47] to make that investment grow but there's
[43:50] one servant said no I'm just going to
[43:52] keep it and hide it yeah he did not do
[43:54] anything to make the investment grow and
[43:57] when the master came back he said you
[43:59] Wicked servant amen you did not amen you
[44:03] know that your master is a hard Master
[44:05] you could have put this am man in an
[44:07] interest bearing account that at least I
[44:09] would have got an interest on it now how
[44:12] many of us have been sitting in the
[44:13] message like that servant with the
[44:15] message that the goods that God have
[44:17] given us all to
[44:18] ourselves amen not gaining any interest
[44:21] on it not gaining any souls for Christ
[44:24] amen not saving our loved ones when the
[44:27] master Returns what will he be able to
[44:29] say to us amen is he going to be able to
[44:32] say to us amen that we have done well we
[44:37] have gained great dividends from what
[44:39] God has given us amen God saved our
[44:41] souls and we save 10
[44:43] others or are we going to say master you
[44:46] know I just kept this message to myself
[44:48] I know that you worked hard to give us
[44:49] this message you sent your prophet and
[44:52] your Prophet lives such a life he
[44:54] sacrificed himself so I just wanted to
[44:56] keep this message and treasure it to
[44:57] myself is that what we're going to say
[45:00] Amen you will say you Wicked and
[45:02] adulterous servant amen yes oh I hope
[45:05] you can sense the coming tonight yes and
[45:08] I know why I'm preaching this message
[45:10] tonight because like I said I I did not
[45:12] want to preach this message tonight I
[45:14] tried my best to look for any other
[45:17] message that I can preach but the angel
[45:18] of the Lord kept me on this message amen
[45:21] I told my P my secretary today who was
[45:23] sitting in front of me you know I didn't
[45:26] have this the the the thoughts and the
[45:27] inspiration about the four horse riders
[45:29] I didn't know it until today I already
[45:32] had prepared all my notes yesterday and
[45:34] I sitting at my office today and these
[45:37] inspiration just started coming and I
[45:38] told my PE if only you knew what is
[45:41] happening right now you're sitting right
[45:42] in front of me you don't know that the
[45:44] angels of the Lord is coming down into
[45:46] this office right now amen oh thank you
[45:49] Jesus so when the Lord speaks amen hear
[45:51] theuk that is coming tonight how long
[45:54] will be selfish with this message amen
[45:56] amen the Lord has given us life amen
[45:59] this message is life this message amen
[46:02] Paul said I am not ashamed of the gospel
[46:04] of Christ oh Hallelujah for it is the
[46:07] power of Salvation to them that believe
[46:10] I'm not ashamed of this message of this
[46:12] hour Lord for this message of the hour
[46:15] is the power of Salvation to them that
[46:18] believe love you Lord Jesus Hallelujah
[46:20] Love You Lord oh Hallelujah you see
[46:22] Jonah thought he could run away from his
[46:24] responsibilities yes oh Jonah was a
[46:26] prophet of the Lord amen and Jonah began
[46:30] to think you know you know Jews have
[46:32] sort of a complex about themselves you
[46:35] know Jew Jews think you know we are the
[46:37] the chosen of God yes I wonder if we get
[46:40] like that sometimes in the message amen
[46:42] we are the chosen of the Lord and Jonah
[46:44] did not want to go down to this people
[46:46] in Nineveh yes amen even though God told
[46:50] him go down he did not want to go down
[46:52] there he began to think who are these
[46:54] people these gentiles that God wants to
[46:56] now give them a chance to repent amen
[46:59] this wicked Nation why must God give
[47:01] them a chance to
[47:02] repent but amen God begin to teach Jonah
[47:05] a lesson amen Jonah had to swallow his
[47:08] pride and get swallowed by a whale yes
[47:11] amen and God begin to teach him a lesson
[47:13] amen amen you know I I put this cartoon
[47:17] on for Shak it's called super book and
[47:19] and in this cartoon they dramatize the
[47:21] Bible stories and I was watching whether
[47:24] the story of you know Jonah and Nineveh
[47:26] and he just dramatizes there how Nineveh
[47:29] was so angry with God why would God want
[47:32] to go down and save this gentile people
[47:34] yes he was so angry with God and God
[47:37] began to tell him God put a tree over
[47:40] him to give him
[47:41] shade and God be and and then Jonah was
[47:44] just relaxing under the shade and then
[47:46] all of a sudden this tree fell down and
[47:48] Jonah began to say God is it so hard to
[47:51] spare the street that was giving me
[47:52] shade and God said why are you getting
[47:55] so angry
[47:56] for a tree that has come up overnight
[47:58] something that you did not plant
[48:00] something that you did not labor for I
[48:02] have brought it up overnight why would
[48:03] you get angry so he's trying to tell him
[48:06] that I have brought the people of Neva
[48:08] you did not bring them why are you
[48:09] getting angry if I saved
[48:12] them amen look at the when Jesus went to
[48:15] Samar uh
[48:17] samarita amen not everyone was happy
[48:20] about that they were like Jesus why are
[48:22] you yes the Jews here why are you going
[48:24] to Samaritan woman why are you going to
[48:27] the people of Samara we are the chosen
[48:30] people amen but you see it's very easy
[48:33] to stay within the confines of the
[48:36] message now what does revelation 10 8
[48:39] and 11 say amen amen not that we must
[48:43] prophesy to the four corners of the
[48:45] message amen but thou must prophesy
[48:48] again to Nations KS and T amen amen and
[48:51] the Bible says they that have the Holy
[48:53] Ghost sigh and cry for the Abomination
[48:56] the
[48:57] city the prophet preached a message
[48:59] unless you are convinced you will not be
[49:01] concerned but when you are convinced of
[49:03] the message oh Hallelujah this is coming
[49:06] now when you are convinced of the messag
[49:08] if you really believe the message in
[49:10] your heart if you really believe that
[49:12] the Lord is coming Hallelujah if you
[49:14] really believe we in the end time you'll
[49:16] begin to have such a concern for your
[49:18] loved ones that's right oh there will be
[49:20] such a deep concern amen for those that
[49:23] are lost yes amen amen now we want to go
[49:26] back to the book of Acts we always say
[49:28] that you know and you know in the book
[49:31] of Acts they did not just gather on a
[49:33] wedness day and on a Sunday and say you
[49:36] know what let's let's just gather on a
[49:37] wedness day and Sunday and hear a nice
[49:39] message you know let's have a combin
[49:41] once a month amen get a nice visiting
[49:44] Minister amen just so that we can
[49:46] rejoice in the in in the this bubble of
[49:48] the message that was not the book of
[49:51] Acts amen the book of Acts was them
[49:54] laboring amen the book of Acts was them
[49:57] going out and getting new converts daily
[49:59] the Bible says new converts were added
[50:01] to them daily yes now we are seeing amen
[50:04] that our hearts our faith has been
[50:06] restored and turned back onto the faith
[50:08] of the Pentecostal fathers
[50:11] hallelujah amen the prophet was never
[50:13] like that amen you notice the prophet
[50:15] was open wherever they invited him to
[50:17] preach he went to preach no matter what
[50:19] denomination it was no matter he
[50:22] associated with many denomination uh
[50:24] ministers
[50:26] and he was careful to say I am not
[50:28] attacking the people in the denomination
[50:30] but I'm attacking the system amen you
[50:34] see we got to be so careful to discern
[50:36] between the two between the system which
[50:38] we hate because God hates the system and
[50:41] the system is cursed and the prophet
[50:43] said the system will never come up again
[50:45] it's cursed amen but the people that are
[50:47] there there are some good people there
[50:50] there are sincere people over there lot
[50:52] is
[50:53] there amen
[50:56] amen and how many of us then can say
[50:59] we've LED more people to Christ than
[51:01] William
[51:02] brandham well how can we if we only stay
[51:04] within the confines of this message
[51:07] right it's a simple equation as 1+ one
[51:11] you want to save Souls we got to go out
[51:12] there amen Mark 16 says amen if we we
[51:16] don't have the slides up but amen I'll
[51:18] just read the scripture amen verse 17
[51:21] Mark 16 and verse 17 says and these
[51:25] shall follow them that believe in my
[51:27] name shall they cast out Devils they
[51:29] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[51:31] take up
[51:32] serpents amen we know the rest of the
[51:34] scripture amen we we we've been speaking
[51:37] about how this is us these signs follow
[51:40] us we are the Believers amen but how
[51:43] many of you know that in the start of
[51:46] verse 17 there's a conjunction there the
[51:48] word end which means the preceding verse
[51:52] is just as important as that verse and
[51:54] what is the preceding verse
[51:56] it's Mark
[51:57] 16:16 go ye into all the world and
[51:59] preach the gospel to every creature and
[52:02] he that believeth and his baptized shall
[52:04] be
[52:05] saved you see we want to jump into verse
[52:08] 17 and these signs shall follow them we
[52:10] lands of the sick they'll recover and
[52:12] we'll do all of these great things but
[52:14] we're not fulfilling the very first part
[52:20] amen now look at the scene in Mark 16
[52:24] Jesus is about to leave the disciples
[52:26] right he's about to ascend into
[52:28] heaven and he's about to give his
[52:31] disciples
[52:32] instructions now knowing that he is
[52:35] leaving he could have given them any
[52:37] kind of instruction he could have told
[52:39] them anything but look at the
[52:41] instruction he gave them he left them
[52:42] with Mark 16 go you into all the world
[52:45] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[52:47] amen this is the instruction that he has
[52:49] given to them before he
[52:52] leaves you see he could have told them
[52:54] you know just just stay there in the
[52:55] upper room he did tell them wait in the
[52:58] upper room but only until the Holy Ghost
[53:00] comes upon them and he could have he
[53:02] could have told them you know just stay
[53:03] here you believe that I am he you 12
[53:06] disciples or whoever else is with you
[53:08] you just form a church amongst yourself
[53:10] you know have a weekly meetings have a
[53:13] monthly combine you know get Peter or
[53:16] one of the top guys every now and again
[53:18] just to give you a good sermon anybody
[53:21] says go into the world and preach the
[53:22] gospel amen and in an age like this
[53:25] where the world is at our
[53:27] fingertips in the fourth dimension amen
[53:30] we don't literally even have to even go
[53:31] travel the world now it's literally
[53:34] there in our
[53:36] fingertips right so we saw that just
[53:38] before he left amen he gave them this
[53:40] instruction and notice in Revelations
[53:42] 108 and
[53:43] 11 the Mysteries have been finished
[53:46] right the mighty Angel come down with
[53:48] the open book The Seals have been
[53:50] unveiled the seventh angel completed his
[53:52] ministry and the mighty Angel could have
[53:55] stopped John and said John you know you
[53:57] eat the book and after you eat the book
[53:59] just enjoy this
[54:01] book did that is that what the angel
[54:03] told him just enjoy this book you know
[54:05] just keep this book amongst yourself get
[54:08] fat with this book just continue eating
[54:10] this book and get fat but he said no go
[54:12] and prophesy again amen after John began
[54:16] to eat the book he had to prophesy again
[54:18] to kindreds Nations and tongues now
[54:20] doesn't that sound familiar doesn't it
[54:21] sound like Mark 16 after the first part
[54:24] of Redemption when Jesus died and rose
[54:26] again he's leaving he says go into the
[54:29] world after the second part of
[54:31] redemption he comes with the open book
[54:32] and he opens the seals to us he says
[54:34] Thou must prophesy again amen you see
[54:37] this is a recurring theme that Jesus is
[54:39] instructing us and if we are not obeying
[54:43] that instruction then there must be a
[54:44] problem that's
[54:47] right
[54:50] amen thank you Lord now you see you you
[54:55] might say you know we believe yes we do
[54:56] believe in Saving the lost we're not
[54:58] saying that we don't believe in Saving
[55:00] the lost but our actions is what matters
[55:04] you see Abraham could have just stayed
[55:05] there and said you know what I believe
[55:06] lot will be saved you know but he had to
[55:09] get into action he had to literally take
[55:12] trained men and literally go and fight
[55:14] the battles you had to literally go and
[55:16] overcome the Kings you had to literally
[55:18] go and save lots and only when he had
[55:21] done this then he met with mdic then
[55:25] then he came and had communion with mzc
[55:28] amen amen the prophet says for this MDC
[55:32] king of Salem priest of the most high
[55:34] God who met Abraham returning from the
[55:36] slaughter of the Kings and blessed him a
[55:39] man Abraham lot his cousin had daxid you
[55:42] see the real true Spirit of Christ I
[55:46] hope you get it amen now the prophet is
[55:48] saying I hope you get it amen we got to
[55:50] pay attention no matter how far lot had
[55:53] backslid when he he was in trouble here
[55:56] come Abraham to him with an army the
[55:58] anel the the AL aliens round about
[56:02] through the valleys of Sodom he had come
[56:04] down and had took the king the Sodom and
[56:06] its
[56:09] Kings
[56:11] amen so we see that amen we got to
[56:13] rescue lot amen now you know you say you
[56:17] know what let's let's let's not talk
[56:19] about these simple things let's let's
[56:20] talk about you know the third pole let's
[56:22] talk about some deep Mysteries amen now
[56:25] let's look at the third poll because
[56:28] under what Ministry did sister atti have
[56:31] the salvation of her two boys it was
[56:34] under the third pool Ministry amen which
[56:37] you could agree with what the prophet
[56:38] was saying and the prophet said right
[56:40] now a super anointing come down he said
[56:42] now say what you want amen amen under
[56:46] the third pool
[56:48] Ministry you see the third pool Ministry
[56:51] involves the saving of the lost you can
[56:53] have your loved ones under the Third
[56:55] Ministry you can claim them you say you
[56:57] know but how are they going to be saved
[56:59] you know they don't listen to me they
[57:00] don't listen to the message that we
[57:01] preach you know how are they going to be
[57:03] Sav claim them amen amen we've been
[57:05] speaking the whole year you have the
[57:07] power Amen in fact what the prophet said
[57:10] to a right that's been said to you this
[57:12] almost the whole year in this church
[57:14] you've heard the minister saying say
[57:16] what you want speak what you want how
[57:18] many of you when that was said took
[57:20] advantage of that and said I'm speaking
[57:21] for the Salvation of my loved ones I'm
[57:24] speaking for the salvation amen of my
[57:26] friends yes amen you see under the third
[57:29] pool Ministry you can claim that
[57:33] amen yes Lord now not only that what's
[57:38] the other part of the third pool
[57:40] Ministry the prophet said the other part
[57:42] of the third pole Ministry in Jesus life
[57:44] was preaching to the Souls Lost in
[57:46] prison now so even if they are not meant
[57:48] to receive what you are saying you still
[57:50] got to preach it to the
[57:52] lost because they need something to
[57:54] stand stand against them on the day of
[57:55] judgment yes now imagine if they come on
[57:58] the day of judgment and God is judging
[57:59] them and they say but God I didn't hear
[58:01] the
[58:02] message then who is God going to turn to
[58:04] he's going to say but this is my son he
[58:07] was responsible for giving you the
[58:09] message yes amen you see so another part
[58:12] of the third poll is preaching to the
[58:15] Lost amen the prophet says and the last
[58:17] name when the last name goes into the
[58:19] book or the last name is redeemed and
[58:21] was put in the book that settles it he
[58:24] comes to what he
[58:26] redeemed amen and it might be a strange
[58:28] time did you ever think people will go
[58:30] on preaching and the church will go on
[58:33] right on even thinking that they're
[58:34] getting people saved and it's too late
[58:37] then amen it's all over see and the
[58:40] message will go totally lost so you see
[58:42] under the third pool also comes the
[58:44] preaching of the
[58:47] Lost amen let's just try and get this
[58:49] mic back
[58:53] on
[59:12] amen once we getting this you see it's
[59:15] all well and good to want to be Esther
[59:18] amen but Esther had to be in a place
[59:19] where she could plead for her
[59:21] people amen there comes a resp a great
[59:24] responsibility with what we have Amen to
[59:27] whom much is given much is required
[59:31] amen amen I'm not going to amen I'm just
[59:33] going to skip the quotes about preaching
[59:35] to the lost because we know amen that
[59:37] was the third part of Jesus ministry the
[59:39] third poll amen so you
[59:42] see some of them will never accept it
[59:45] but it's our responsibility to preach it
[59:47] yes right
[59:48] amen now now don't get me wrong as well
[59:52] I'm not saying that we are to bring
[59:53] everyone in the message now because not
[59:56] everyone is predestinated to receive the
[59:59] message we know that we know this
[1:00:02] message is for elect people a minority
[1:00:04] people the bride of Christ yes right but
[1:00:09] how many of you know the prophet there
[1:00:11] are different groups of people in
[1:00:13] heaven amen there's the bride who's the
[1:00:16] Queen of Heaven there's the servants
[1:00:18] which is the 144,000 but the prophet
[1:00:21] said there was a multitude of people
[1:00:23] saved in Tribulation yes a multitude of
[1:00:26] people a great multitude of people you
[1:00:29] see you might not be able to bring
[1:00:31] someone into the message but you can
[1:00:33] sure save their souls from Hell amen you
[1:00:36] can sure pull them out of hell amen amen
[1:00:39] we might not be able to get them yeah
[1:00:41] but at least save them from Hell amen
[1:00:43] and that is what Abraham could not pull
[1:00:45] lot into the message of the hour lot
[1:00:48] never became a message believer after
[1:00:50] that you know what happened with lot's
[1:00:52] lineage he never became a message
[1:00:55] believer but he has saved from the
[1:00:56] destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:00:59] that is what I'm trying to say tonight
[1:01:00] we cannot bring everyone into the
[1:01:02] message but we can save them from
[1:01:05] hell if not us then
[1:01:07] who If Not Us Then Who because their own
[1:01:10] teachers remember what happened to the
[1:01:12] kings of Sodom and gomorra they
[1:01:14] themselves got taken captive and we
[1:01:16] never say what the five Kings type we
[1:01:18] spoke about the Four Kings who took them
[1:01:20] captive but what do the five kings that
[1:01:22] were taking captive type that type
[1:01:25] amen you have five senses in your flesh
[1:01:27] the flesh man these were people that
[1:01:29] were governed by the flesh
[1:01:32] man amen and the four Hors Powers were
[1:01:35] able to take them over because all they
[1:01:37] had was their five senses all they had
[1:01:39] was to walk in the flesh they didn't
[1:01:41] have the spirit man to rule them and
[1:01:43] Reign them so they were taken captive so
[1:01:46] not even lot's Kings could save him so
[1:01:50] their own preachers in the denomination
[1:01:52] cannot save them they themselves are
[1:01:54] taking captive they themselves have been
[1:01:56] deceived by the first horse rider they
[1:01:59] themselves have been taken amen by all
[1:02:00] of these horse riders amen so their only
[1:02:03] hope is US
[1:02:06] amen amen
[1:02:10] amen see there's different reasons for
[1:02:12] preaching the
[1:02:14] gospel one is to find the predestinated

[1:02:25] predestinated seed but that should not
[1:02:28] be the only goal of Outreach because
[1:02:30] that's only the first goal of Outreach
[1:02:33] the second goal is to preach to those
[1:02:36] that Lo that are lost in prison now and
[1:02:38] the third goal is to save the people
[1:02:41] that are not meant to be bried but to
[1:02:43] save them from hell those are your three
[1:02:45] objectives for doing
[1:02:49] outrage

[1:03:20] to the whole family like in Egypt
[1:03:23] Jericho

[1:03:30] thou and all thy household shall be
[1:03:33] saved apply to your family now here's
[1:03:36] the prophet saying apply the token to

[1:04:04] the house get rid of it burn up your
[1:04:06] shorts throw your C tables away because
[1:04:09] all of these things if you want to say
[1:04:11] you claiming them but you going to be a
[1:04:13] stumbling block to them then you're not
[1:04:15] saving them you're being a stumbling
[1:04:16] block to them
[1:04:18] amen amen we say we live in the message
[1:04:20] we got to show them that the message has
[1:04:22] high standards we got to show them that
[1:04:24] we have not let down the bars because
[1:04:26] then they can see the Life of Christ in
[1:04:28] us and then that to them will be not a
[1:04:31] stumbling block but a stepping stone for
[1:04:33] them to climb
[1:04:35] up amen then you're getting ready then
[1:04:38] apply the token in prayer with real
[1:04:40] evidence real Faith amen you read the
[1:04:43] quote that Sister Kim put on the group
[1:04:45] today real Faith amen not just any any
[1:04:49] old Faith amen but real Faith amen
[1:04:52] applied with confidence when you apply
[1:04:54] the
[1:04:55] token amen
[1:04:59] hallelujah so amen we see that Abraham
[1:05:02] had to fight amen now amen we focused
[1:05:05] Amen on Abraham saving lot but not only
[1:05:08] that Abraham also had to fight these
[1:05:10] Kings as a type of us having to defeat
[1:05:13] these Kings ourself in our own lives we
[1:05:15] have to defeat the Flesh in our own
[1:05:17] lives amen we have to defeat every
[1:05:19] demonic power that comes against us as
[1:05:21] well and only then when we are
[1:05:23] victorious as well in our own life then
[1:05:26] we can go and meet the Lord and have
[1:05:27] communion with
[1:05:29] him the prophet said when we overcome
[1:05:31] our battles yes when we are victorious
[1:05:34] amen amen then we too will meet the
[1:05:37] Lord see many times we want to have
[1:05:40] communion we have fellowship with God we
[1:05:42] know communion is fellowship with God
[1:05:44] communicating with God yes and we want
[1:05:47] to have fellowship with God but we have
[1:05:49] not overcome the flesh man amen we still
[1:05:52] held captive in the flesh
[1:05:54] so how can we commune with God because
[1:05:57] what does what Fellowship has light with
[1:06:01] Darkness amen and the bread and wine
[1:06:04] types the word and Revelation yes you
[1:06:07] see we want the Deep Revelations of the
[1:06:09] word but we have to defeat the flesh man
[1:06:12] amen before we come to that otherwise
[1:06:15] the word that you receive will just be
[1:06:17] head knowledge to you amen amen you'll
[1:06:19] have no power behind it because the
[1:06:21] flesh will be bound now what if Abraham
[1:06:24] was himself held captive by these Kings
[1:06:28] can you imagine if these Kings took
[1:06:29] Abraham captive how was he going to be
[1:06:32] able to rescue lot if he himself was
[1:06:35] captive see lot's salvation was based on
[1:06:39] Abraham being in a position of strength
[1:06:42] in Abraham was in mamre a position of
[1:06:44] strength a position of fatness lot lot
[1:06:47] salvation was dependent on Abraham being
[1:06:50] in a position of strength because then
[1:06:52] Abraham could go and deliver
[1:06:54] him if Abraham himself was captive lot's
[1:06:58] Hope was gone you see so if you are
[1:07:01] captive by the things of the world and
[1:07:03] the flesh is dominating your spirit man
[1:07:06] how are you going to save the
[1:07:08] Lost how is your loved ones even going
[1:07:10] to have a chance if you yourself in the
[1:07:12] message are not being a conqueror and
[1:07:15] not being Victorious yes amen if you are
[1:07:19] not coming to that right position your
[1:07:21] loved ones are lost there's no hope for
[1:07:22] them
[1:07:25] amen so you see why being a Christian is
[1:07:28] not only for ourselves it's to live for
[1:07:31] others amen we have to reach our
[1:07:33] position and overcome not only for our
[1:07:35] own benefit but it's for the benefit of
[1:07:38] others amen it does not even the bible
[1:07:41] say that even nature itself is waiting
[1:07:42] for us even nature is depending on us
[1:07:45] coming into our position even those in
[1:07:48] the sixth Dimension are waiting for us
[1:07:51] so you see being a Christian is not just
[1:07:52] about ourselves there's a whole lot of
[1:07:54] people that are waiting upon
[1:07:58] us so that is why as a Christian we got
[1:08:01] to get rid of The Selfish mindset amen
[1:08:03] we got to get rid of worrying about our
[1:08:05] own dreams our own Ambitions our own
[1:08:07] promotion you know only woring about the
[1:08:10] growth of our own immediate family amen
[1:08:12] you know that's not the life of a
[1:08:14] Christian the life of a Christian is
[1:08:16] living for others you see in the book of
[1:08:18] Acts he brought all the belongings and
[1:08:21] wealth to the disciples and he said
[1:08:23] distributed amongst the Believers they
[1:08:24] wasn't only focused on my wife my
[1:08:27] children now we know the prophet said
[1:08:29] communal living won't work in this age
[1:08:32] but I'm saying look at the character of
[1:08:33] a Christian amen we are not to be
[1:08:36] selfish we got to come to our position
[1:08:39] of strength so that we can be of benefit
[1:08:41] to others amen the Supernatural is not
[1:08:44] only for us it's for the benefit of
[1:08:47] others
[1:08:49] amen you see now I'm preparing us for
[1:08:51] when the squeeze comes because when the
[1:08:53] squeeze comes times we can't only focus
[1:08:54] on my wife my children amen we got to be
[1:08:57] there for each other in that time amen
[1:09:01] hallelujah we got to be real Christians
[1:09:03] then amen we got to not be selfish
[1:09:06] then amen so mzc amen King theing before
[1:09:10] the body change amen Abraham had to
[1:09:14] overcome these things hallelujah amen he
[1:09:17] never had a name change yet he never had
[1:09:18] a body change yet amen he never even
[1:09:21] come to the stage where he produced
[1:09:22] Isaac is yet you had to overcome the the
[1:09:25] flesh man you to overcome these
[1:09:30] Powers amen hallelujah amen I'm almost
[1:09:33] drawing to a close amen the prophet is
[1:09:36] perfect picture of Christ and the church
[1:09:38] the Holy Spirit leading the faithful
[1:09:40] that's born in the same house of the
[1:09:42] Holy Ghost where Christ was born
[1:09:44] pursuing after the Wayward and
[1:09:47] backslidden Hallelujah yes pursuing
[1:09:50] after the Wayward do you know what the
[1:09:52] word pursuing is amen it's a verb amen
[1:09:57] it's an action word it's going after
[1:09:59] them amen and now you know agent said we
[1:10:03] our ministry is to slay every Force
[1:10:05] every Power every evil and slaying every
[1:10:09] evil thing that's overcome
[1:10:11] them what's overcome them the four the
[1:10:14] the powers of the four horse riders have
[1:10:16] overcome them overcoming sin laying
[1:10:19] aside all the weights speaking to the
[1:10:21] people about their lust and the things
[1:10:22] that they're doing cut it off their
[1:10:25] sicknesses and all preaching to them the
[1:10:27] gospel and bringing them back into the
[1:10:29] fellowship of
[1:10:32] Goden amen last quote a very beautiful
[1:10:35] type of when the battle is over here on
[1:10:37] Earth the victories have been won Jesus
[1:10:40] said they would eat a new in the
[1:10:42] father's Kingdom Hallelujah after the
[1:10:44] waywood has been brought back then the
[1:10:46] first thing we do when we go in after
[1:10:48] the battle is over he sit down at the
[1:10:51] table in the kingdom of God Amen and
[1:10:53] there those that have fought now notice
[1:10:56] it's those that are fought yes if you
[1:10:59] have not fought you're not going to be
[1:11:01] there the prophet said it's all yours
[1:11:04] but you got to fight every inch of it
[1:11:06] yes
[1:11:07] amen and there those that has fought and
[1:11:10] sat down and overcome like Abraham was
[1:11:14] Overcomer shall be clothed in the
[1:11:17] righteousness of Christ and then again
[1:11:20] they take the bread and the wine in the
[1:11:22] father's Kingdom on the other side what
[1:11:25] a real picture this is of Abraham going
[1:11:28] out and getting lot and bringing him
[1:11:30] back
[1:11:31] amen so us he saying us being in that
[1:11:36] Kingdom and being clothed in Christ's
[1:11:38] righteousness and partaking of the
[1:11:40] communion is tied up with us saving
[1:11:44] lot am amen soen I pray that amen you've
[1:11:48] been blessed you get the just of the
[1:11:50] message a simple message but like I said
[1:11:53] the Lord want me to go any other if it
[1:11:55] was up to me I would like to preach
[1:11:56] something deep some deep mystery but the
[1:11:59] Lord didn't want me to go any other way
[1:12:01] but on this amen amen and you know I was
[1:12:04] I was like I told you I told my
[1:12:06] secretary if you only knew what's
[1:12:08] happening right now the angel of the
[1:12:10] Lord is coming in and out of this office
[1:12:13] and then when I was on my way to church
[1:12:14] I was you know thinking about this and I
[1:12:16] was thinking why why preach this message
[1:12:18] now you know it's just a simple message
[1:12:20] that people know this why preach it now
[1:12:22] and then my thought went to what who who
[1:12:25] is Abraham's people it's Israel right
[1:12:28] natural Israel and what's happening in
[1:12:30] Israel now is that they at War and
[1:12:34] notice they've been a portion of the
[1:12:36] people have been captured and taken into
[1:12:39] Gaza yes they've kidnapped them and take
[1:12:42] them and who did they kidnap it was
[1:12:44] those close to the Border they were
[1:12:46] currently in a rave
[1:12:48] party in a Sodom condition and lot was
[1:12:51] in a lot was a Jew Lord was Abraham's
[1:12:54] people in a Sodom condition he was in
[1:12:57] and they came and captured them and took
[1:13:00] them and what the natural types the
[1:13:04] spiritual so if we see nine Israel that
[1:13:07] these people have been captured and
[1:13:09] taken is a type of how our loved ones
[1:13:12] have been captured Amen in the spiritual
[1:13:15] yes but it's up to us Amen to claim them
[1:13:18] back the prophet says we are entitled to
[1:13:20] claim them back we are entitled to apply
[1:13:23] the token and claim them amen sister at
[1:13:27] could have asked for anything the
[1:13:29] prophet
[1:13:30] said she could have asked for the
[1:13:32] healing of her of her sister she could
[1:13:34] have asked for money the prophet said
[1:13:35] but she is concerned about the salvation
[1:13:37] of her two boys now you with the same
[1:13:40] power in the third pole the power to
[1:13:41] speak the word what are you doing with
[1:13:43] it amen amen to him whom much is given
[1:13:48] much is required amen overcoming amen
[1:13:50] the powers that beat these four horse

[1:14:33] but now even in the second part of
[1:14:35] redemption when John taken the book and
