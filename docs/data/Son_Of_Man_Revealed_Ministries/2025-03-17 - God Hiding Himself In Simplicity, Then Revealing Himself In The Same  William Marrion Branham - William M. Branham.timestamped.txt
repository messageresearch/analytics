[0:00] now I want to read also in the book of
[0:03] St Matthew's gospel the 11th chapter of
[0:07] St
[0:08] Matthew 26 and 27 at that time Jesus
[0:12] answered and said I thank thee oh Father
[0:17] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou H
[0:20] has hid these things from the wise and
[0:24] prudent and has revealed them unto be
[0:29] even so father for so it seems good in
[0:34] thy sight catch those two scriptures who
[0:39] has believed our
[0:41] report and to whom is the arm of the
[0:44] Lord revealed stand Jesus thank God that
[0:48] he had hid the mysteries from the wise
[0:51] and prudent and would reveal it to babes
[0:56] such as would learn for it seemed good
[0:59] to God to do do that now from this text
[1:03] or from this scripture reading I draw
[1:06] this text God hiding himself in
[1:12] Simplicity than revealing himself in the
[1:15] same it is strange to think how that God
[1:19] does such a thing as
[1:21] that God will hide himself and something
[1:26] so simple that will cause the wise to
[1:29] miss an a million
[1:30] miles and then turn right back around in
[1:33] that s simple thing in the Simplicity of
[1:37] his way of working and reveal right out
[1:39] again and as I have made the old
[1:42] statement many times that man Still
[1:45] Remains man man is always giving God
[1:50] praise for what he did do and always
[1:53] looking forward to what he will do and
[1:55] ignoring what he's doing they fail to
[1:59] see what a simp thing he used to do it
[2:01] with see and then they look forward and
[2:04] see a great thing coming that's going to
[2:07] happen and nine times out of 10 it's
[2:10] already happening right around them and
[2:12] so simple that they don't
[2:14] know one day uh a man up here at udica
[2:19] and he claimed that there was no such a
[2:21] thing as God and I understood that by
[2:25] this the man was gloriously converted to
[2:28] Christ at the age of about 85 years old
[2:32] he asked a little girl one day who was
[2:35] uh coming from Sunday school why did she
[2:38] Wast her time on doing such a thing as
[2:40] that she said because she believed that
[2:42] there was a
[2:44] God and Mr Dy said that he said child
[2:48] you are so wrong to believe in such a
[2:51] thing as that and said that the little
[2:54] girl stooped down and picked up a a
[2:59] little flow to out of the off of the
[3:02] ground pulled it from its
[3:04] pedals and said Mr Darcy could you tell
[3:08] me how this
[3:11] lives there it was when he begin to
[3:15] search back he could said to the child
[3:18] what's growing in the earth and then the
[3:20] questions could Revol back where' the
[3:22] Earth come from how'd that seed get
[3:25] there what happened on on on and run it
[3:27] on back until he seen
[3:31] see not the great glamorous things that
[3:34] we think about but it's the simple
[3:36] things that God is so
[3:39] real the
[3:40] simplicity so it pleases God to reveal
[3:45] himself and then hide himself then hide
[3:49] himself and reveal himself in simple
[3:52] little things it's it's put over the top
[3:55] of the head of man because if you'd say
[3:58] why would a just God do that is because
[4:02] that man was made up in the beginning
[4:05] not to try to shift for
[4:08] himself a man was made to rely
[4:12] completely upon God that's reason we're
[4:16] liken to Lambs or sheep a sheep cannot
[4:20] lead himself he has to have a leader and
[4:23] the Holy Spirit supposed to lead us so
[4:27] man is made that way and God made all of
[4:30] his works so simple that the simple
[4:34] could understand it and God makes
[4:37] himself simple with the simple in order
[4:40] to be understood by the simple we
[4:43] stumble over
[4:46] Simplicity God is so simple until the
[4:49] scholars of these days and all days miss
[4:53] him a million miles but listen to the
[4:56] Simplicity of God and then you find God
[5:00] right you're in the simple ways and I'm
[5:02] not here to contradict school and
[5:06] education and try to support ill litness
[5:10] I'm not here for that but what it is the
[5:13] people as so place so much upon on
[5:17] that until they're even in the
[5:19] seminaries and so forth they're missing
[5:22] the very thing that God has put before
[5:25] them now today we preach philosophy we
[5:29] preach readed and
[5:31] denominationalism and so many things and
[5:33] leaving off the word because they say it
[5:36] can't be understood it can be understood
[5:39] he promised to do it now we're asking
[5:43] him to do it now we're going to take a
[5:45] few characters here for a few minutes
[5:48] let's notice in the days of Noah Noah's
[5:53] day God seen worldly wisdom so greatly
[5:58] punctuated and respected he sent a
[6:02] simple message by a simple person to
[6:06] show them his grace found an illiterate
[6:10] maybe
[6:12] farmer by the name of Noah a sheep
[6:15] herder and the simple message of of
[6:18] building an ark constructing is
[6:21] something to get into that there's no
[6:23] water to float it while he become a
[6:27] fanatic and he become a hard ball now
[6:31] then again in Moses day notice another
[6:36] time of
[6:37] Deliverance when God is just about to do
[6:41] something to deliver his people God
[6:43] sends a message to the people and it's
[6:46] so simple as we'll catch the breaking of
[6:49] these seals that's my purpose of
[6:50] bringing this first that we find out
[6:53] that the breaking of those seals is so
[6:56] simple the the the smart missed a
[6:58] million miles amen hallelujah I hope
[7:02] that God anoints me for see see it just
[7:06] goes over the top and that's I thought
[7:08] this message this morning would be
[7:09] appropriate to lay a foundation on the
[7:12] Simplicity of God see how God hides
[7:16] himself in
[7:18] Simplicity
[7:19] now notice Moses in the day that God was
[7:23] going to deliver the children of Israel
[7:25] according to his word he what did he do
[7:29] e chose a simple family we have no
[7:32] record of it see just a son of Levi is
[7:35] all we know and so uh we U and his wife
[7:40] just an ordinary uh probably mud Dober
[7:45] as a were with things out there making
[7:47] brick for the enemy is just an ordinary
[7:50] slave in Israel but God chose that
[7:54] family to bring forth the
[7:57] deliverer just an ordinary Jewish Family
[8:00] he never went and got royalty and
[8:02] celebrity or something or even got some
[8:05] priest he took a common ordinary family
[8:10] Simplicity how he always works in
[8:14] Simplicity yeah but God in the beginning
[8:17] that could have made the sun preach the
[8:19] gospel or the winds preach the gospel or
[8:22] an angel preach the gospel but he
[8:24] ordained man for that purpose and he
[8:27] never changes it we could tell take a a
[8:30] look at Cain and Abel how that that Cain
[8:34] tried to please God by some beauty
[8:39] another way people think by a great fine
[8:43] dressed congregation by uh priest with
[8:47] with ministers with robed in robed
[8:49] choirs and all the the put on that
[8:52] pleases God can you see where it come
[8:55] from Cain tried the same thing and he
[8:59] buil him an Al no doubt that he made it
[9:01] pretty and the man was sincere he
[9:04] worshiped he thought as long as I'm
[9:06] sincere it doesn't make any difference
[9:08] it does make a difference you can be
[9:10] sincerely wrong but Able by
[9:15] Revelation by faith offered unto God a
[9:19] more excellent sacrifice nothing clean
[9:21] about it as far as it look humanly
[9:25] speaking but it pleased God to reveal is
[9:30] secret to Abel by simple faith in the
[9:34] shed blood notice Elijah's day God chose
[9:40] to hide himself in a simple person now
[9:44] just think of it can you grasp it God
[9:49] hiding in a illiterate and Elijah
[9:53] humbled himself and stayed with what God
[9:56] Said in such a way that it pleased God
[9:58] to take that same Spirit from Elijah and
[10:02] promised to shove it three times down
[10:04] the road from
[10:05] that amen and he did
[10:09] it sure he did sure he promised it that
[10:13] it would come and it come up Elisha his
[10:16] successor that come on John the Baptist
[10:19] according Malachi 4 supposed to be here
[10:21] again in the last
[10:22] day Lo God loved that spirit that was up
[10:26] on that simple uneducated Woodsman from
[10:29] back there in the wood somewhere and so
[10:32] it was so obedient to his word that he
[10:35] could say Elijah do this and Elijah
[10:37] would do it and God hid himself in there
[10:40] such Simplicity God in Simplicity amen
[10:43] he does the same thing the Way Up Is
[10:46] Down always humble yourselves don't
[10:49] never say well I got this and that you
[10:50] ain't got nothing just just remember if
[10:53] you got the grace of God just be
[10:54] thankful for
[10:56] it but when he came on the seene in such
[11:01] [Music]
[11:02] Simplicity they missed him they missed
[11:05] him
[11:07] L wood Banks when we sitting down there
[11:10] and know the
[11:11] god Vindicated truth when a little old
[11:15] dead men of fish laying on the water and
[11:17] the Holy Spirit spoke the day before he
[11:19] had go to show him his glory and do
[11:21] something about it and there that
[11:23] morning standing the Holy Spirit come
[11:24] down in that boat and raised up and
[11:26] spoke to that fish and it laying on the
[11:28] water dead for half half hour his gills
[11:30] and inals pulled out of its mouth it
[11:32] come to life and swim away as good as
[11:33] any other fish what is it God hiding
[11:37] himself in
[11:38] Simplicity are you
