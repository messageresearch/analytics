armor Prophet to say about the armor you see if we can give it a title let's try to eat chicha amen now we are going to speak about the inside amen amen amen and you know this inside teacher is the prophet taught us this inside the teacher is the teacher is to point us to the truth amen and what is the truth the truth is the word of God amen amen so let's enjoy to hear about the inside amen and I believe yes there the brothers were saying other things some things here I enjoyed it because I said oh that's it amen amen so we we we start by this what the prophet says in this message uh the seven churches the C minor Church age chapter four see what the prophet says then the paragraphs not there but you you just follow what I'm saying here if you can find it those who are always this machine these touches they know how to take it [Music] the teacher came and teach all truth says now what God is a sign sorry when God is silent then you can start there now when God is silent we had better be silent amen yes when God is silent we better be silent yes sir amen but where he is spoken speak too and say what yeah you can hear somebody lying through this yeah that's evidence or what would happen after being tell you the Holy Ghost amen amen but that teacher was in inside teacher yes outside the teacher which is comparative and it's a must for you to help to point you to the true man Hallelujah yes amen are we together I believe you deserve this Insanity amen if you don't have this inside the teacher I believe that today is your day amen amen so sometimes for you to understand this is do not understand it amen you might not get revealed to him by the inside the teacher yeah so Simeon was on but it was the result because that you are not going until to him by the Holy Ghost amen when the Holy Ghost reveal something to you amen it's part of you hallelujah amen no one can in and lived by it amen amen and when he he said in in the message the life story you see I used a natural Soldier he used to deserve that uniform but come afraid a soldier wanted to be a a soldier a natural Soldier let's go for that one in the life story let me give you the the the quotation that was 1952 -07 he's saying here football he says but you know what you know what since I finally did join the Army he wanted to to join the this central army but God was waiting with him yes Amen to join the real and amen we are in the room amen for everyone of you you joined this Adam yes but he was thinking on the natural but the God said you joined me there since the finally did the fight I I I finally did joined the army you may not see my uniform and we may not see your uniform yes are you getting the inside teacher now oh yes yes every Soldier you must have a uniform yes if you are a soldier this morning you must say are not divisible amen but you do have such uniform that uniform this afternoon amen you sit inside teacher yes it's not inside the teacher [Music] the teacher that's why the prophet says we as a message believe Disciples of the word yes amen so then you become this word you know I always say in my church huh I always see are you listening I always say you are not a believer I said why am I saying that you you don't believe but I said it's God in you believing then you become a Believer it's like the teacher believing his word amen amen amen and that's why Holy Ghost one of the purpose of the Holy Ghost eh amen the purpose of the Holy Ghost amen is the father but the father dwelling is the Plan of Redemption amen working through you making you a co-worker with him amen giving you giving you a part of your Fallen Lord amen giving you his spirit and his love amen ask him to a man or a woman when it strikes into their hearts yes it takes its about amen that's that's a test in hungering for lost souls you see the purpose of the Holy Ghost amen is the father through you is the father again but it's not the Holy Ghost without the inside teacher can you do that but the purpose of inside teacher is the father again he wants to continue with this work of redemption amen amen for Israel's Redemption he's there to use you to continue looking for the Lost source he can't come down himself he said to you Amen to continue with the ministry to continue amen because of the inside the inside teacher is you is it hey you are humbling you want to testify about the message about Jesus Christ about salvation about the coming of the Lord amen why is because of the inside teacher amen the Holy Ghost are we together yes amen the inside teacher you know that's not even the prophet was telling us now about the whole armor amen he was telling us of the the the the whole Amma now where we went see to take the whole armor and the process was deciding about the whole arm what is the whole armor when Paul was saying You must put on who would take the whole armor at the two books you take the list it's not the other one this one let's take this one product of 88 are you still here says something knows Resurrection he not it would take the Holy Ghost are you getting that because men cannot do these things he equipped his army with the Holy Ghost Amen to do those things to make known the secrets of the heart as he promised he equips his animal he claims your brother sister amen with the inside Jesus and inside teacher as I said is a pointer to the truth amen is she says to make known the secrets of the house as he promised you can't do that with any kind of training then you've got to do that by the baptism of the Holy Spirit because amen baptism of the Holy Ghost Armor then the prophet came he is telling us what is that is oh I mean that's hard put on the whole armor saying receive the Holy Ghost this is the inside the teacher he said pointer amen you can't be deceived the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost said to point you to the world Amen pointed to the message to point it to the truth receiving the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen that's inside the teacher and you feel good with the inside amen amen you know I met you 24 24. and they are all right you shall arise false Christ false process and you know what the prophet just within anointing with an anointing to deceive people right that's why people say yes but meant to say it but elect Ed amen regardless of this Force false process amen amen about the truth yes amen it sits on the truth amen amen amen hallelujah it's there to tell you Jesus Christ it's still the same God yesterday amen hallelujah amen is there to tell you Jesus Christ is Jehovah yes his ever present he's here this morning you know when the prophet preached that message seven compounds names of Jehovah you know what they say he said of course it's Jehovah jelly I'm paraphrasing you can read it you see this of course it's over General it's John Van Alpha it's Joe Vanishing but among those names there is one outstanding yes that is Jehovah Psalms 46 yes a very present help a big time of trouble he is always present Hallelujah and he spoke of the prophet yes she was not that she she passed on 80. he went there with uh with this other sister and Billy Paul was there I believe you are six years old and they went there into the woods what happened he said I I had only 20 US Dollars amen but while he was there he left his wife in Billy Paul were there in the tent he said I'll come back quickly see

big again well he was standing here first time second time you could go some things whatever but you find himself at the same place and the prophet said you call it a death war when you do that the Angels they call it is a dead walk and that's what you don't know where you're going You're conscious he said that he said that work yeah save that in that message then he was doing that you know what was happening wanted to prove to that you are lost but him are he said no I know my way back and God was coming through Jehovah that title I am Jehovah Psalms 46 yes in time of trouble has the very present help the very present in time of trouble amen you see he was hearing God is speaking to him but you say no amen is one of the words the present but yeah and the strength yes if any person help it my Prophet is in trouble yeah the family this is a human time my family will die my boy will die he was going wrong like that but God was always safe that's one of the things one of the things again God was speaking to you so God was saying a man does seven detective steps that one is outstanding Jehovah why it speaks of the presence of God is present God is our strength a very present when you're sleeping is present amen he says feel this present he needs you to recognize that amen God is speaking to me [Music] most I I I I will do it but I'm lost help me Lord descriptions what we say God is praying what happened the weather changed we follow those telephone lines big boy I never present come Hallelujah wherever you are yes it is is are we together yes Hebrews 2 pass until you have the Holy Ghost there to manifest that amen Touch the Light because then you are spreading all the power of the whistle you are doing put in the worlds of the devil put on the inside get your God will stand the words of the devil amen the baptism with all the Holy Ghost hey it's something and you want to activate yourself at work so that they call you greeting before the dimension yes they are thinking that was against civilization it might happen if you can shoot other things in the air we'll see what they're doing when they say no to prove that our God is people but to grown animals what is that they want to prove something but there's no God is trying to take ourselves amen by this Insight is upgrading itself yes amen like what's happening in Russia with the inside the teacher the Holy Ghost will take you away yet today teacher will point you there hey what's that no somebody look they're not just tickets the inside teacher always point you to those things amen watch Russia or to go into the laboratory to choose their things so I can tell them okay let's get to them Philippians chapter 3 verse 4 Paul was trying to upgrade amen amen praise the Lord either we're already perfect but I followed that if that I may apprehend it yes that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus I can say now I understand everything yes that for which also have apprehended huh the next verse what do you say brother I talked about myself to have apprehended huh but this one thing I those things which are behind first and to those things which are before amen amen the Holy Ghost is there to reaching you always reaching first and those things which are what the mark of the price of the high quality of God in Christ Jesus amen we are blessing towards the mark of the high court yes just upgrading ourselves as a Christians as message Believers the Holy Ghost in US yes ah is there to tell us being you I mean in building the furnaces you are like your father from the beginning

agree this message is Supernatural amen amen what you are believing is Supernatural amen amen are we together amen amen God is good all the time amen amen that's why I said I'll put my laws into their hearts I put my laws in the past foreign are you following of one oh hundreds wait it says 25 the prophet is commending that you see about the Garment so that you see the bride who stands at the door and all comes up with an invitation no one come uh can come to this other accent by me all the father has given me or invited will come to me here they come and give their invitation The Pride groom

stuff and the oil is hot when not come there okay and it jumps up in the area tells white it's just up zero entertainment um it turns white the yellow is good and it becomes twice inside it becomes light the way it is light that's why comes back twice in size and half is light okay half is heavy as it was a little yellow afraid it's you amen and it turns you white amen you receive the Holy Ghost it detects you white from yellow yes not behind but it doesn't matter the things of the world no more when you receive the holy ghosts amen desert upgrade yes oh and then the fifth the power and the fire of the light you just see you are not in that it's in the Moon so yes with that yellowish thing ah are you getting you are white is that yellowish is good meeting huh the stuff must be shown but light when you receive the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Inside the kitchen amen everything's no no these symptoms those things sometimes we are being affected other things Corinthians chapter I just want to say this hey sometimes you're being affected with these history things what we see what we hear what we know which is just it came like that or else to go to other things [Music] now Paul is saying here there are two things you know like some symptoms are terrible you might be feeling Temple now what we see is not permanent is temporal what we hear is it slow symptoms yeah but what you should say hey things which are sin are temporal ah that's a table with those things those symptoms those things are terrible but he's saying here Paul but eternal you can see faith and that's why the prophecy wanted what is your healing are we together amen get together amen praise the Lord your God is good all the time things Eternal things the word of God then when you receive the Holy Ghost it becomes so alight let me read this one a one two zero five the prophet is saying something here interesting friends fight it for a certain company prophet he saw something victim how are you going to sweep or all these things why don't you remove all his comments I'll show you wait a minute amen so he's saying here he stood there and we watched them got out he took I mean maybe to remove all this whatever rubbish see he was thinking that hey this is this this job is poor it's too big how many people are being held here but the man said he said I will show you Reverend Ibraham [Music] I said oh he walked over there in the prison said just watch it here come and create become way up high come down and shoot and beat a practically all of them shout the right up against the word right or see if they demagnetize the thing and every bit molded again amen amen amen you see what's the matter with something because then you start creates magnet he said who man he said teachers there [Music] is the point I want to ask you something I said why and he said well you see Reverend brother say that is not magnetized to it he said what's the matter with you Hallelujah are you getting that actually he says he said what something my brother is bolted down get that let me see it's in that iron to be magnetized don't know they pull off the magnet everyone must be mathematized you know what not aluminum he wanted to jump oh no this one here do you want to jump but you are voted with the things of the world glory to God he said it's a big Market [Music] I want to say something I failed to say something very important you know you this church is benefited quite a lot amen amen from him right you know what is I can preach that one awesome even if when you say influence is better than or toilet because inference stands for Generations yes what is being invested in this church in you yes by Pastor only stands for Generation you can see it's amazing do you think you as a very very bad kid to sacrifice something and God was not him about that but what he was a God-fearing King watch the influence it came from his father who was his father and his father he was a considering King in his interest he called it from somewhere so his father was his father he said to us but to us but it responds for Generations yes so in the work in reference is excited it is fun for Generation but where Authority is excited it won't last amen all of you are working maybe when the blessings of it is he was preaching the true message of the hour amen let that true messages what was preaching his pass for Generations better than if you use Authority the children they said okay he's here because you are there they give you a nickname when you're dead because they said oh he's coming it's okay you see that day you know because Authority is being excited that we're influence real influence is excited hey it's responsible Generations in your children it's harmful I can take that in the Bible and show you yes that's why the prophet said in the message in France influence about Abraham Lincoln what happened Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln his influence he got it from his mother she was a Godly mother and that mother was teaching amen [Music] together is better than Authority you know sisters you know what the prophet says he says we've got four bushels much look John and yes but see the fifth one his mother amen yes amen not that your preachers no not that your preachers your children is the gospel He said Out The Gospel you know sisters can you teach your children how to talk oh the father teaching the children the child in the top but the mother knows how to do it because he is in them that's why he said Mother's time Mother's Day that's why the prophet to his mother's day are in their church amen so we want the innocence of the Holy Ghost here to spans for Generations that's when the near church start started the way it dependencies inside the kitchen you're still here amen amen he's still here with you Elders here bless this influence of the inside teacher of the message of our responsible generation amen thank you until the young ones they will tell no point yes that it wasn't sure from the beginning he passed himself from that time why because the influence stands for Generations amen amen it just flows I've noticed [Music] oh God bless me then there's people being magnetized oh you might be the message from that victory it says oh you might be is she but love unless you are magnetized put the power of them and said and the confirmed of his power by the amen this this God is going to switch it on Amen if you come down here Brothers to those who are not important I don't jump like that yellow crane like that popcorn you get magnetized the son of man magnet who God will drop it down left your time amen [Music] Immaculate amen come for us move the inside teacher we are magnetized about it those who are still here the ability said now can you see the time of those uh is it Matthew 25 off 10-1 10 versions you can see the tiger saying here are those television remember they were features of the bridegroom all of them praise the Lord but that day switched on for those with oil but those who don't rare and oil is the Holy Ghost those without prayer they remain they said wait wait wait wait wait because they're still voted amen remember that's where the Prophet asked that man what about this iron says that is the iron must be magnetized but it was bought in fact which way you know there are same material you see material yes but the five they were supposed to go through tribulation without the oil but those is oil the bright you and me with that much in it you switched on you just go amen because you have the Holy Ghost the inside because of this inside teacher when this you come yes amen are you getting this and some of these Shackled down people with World lasts and Pleasures will be left there in God but again all
