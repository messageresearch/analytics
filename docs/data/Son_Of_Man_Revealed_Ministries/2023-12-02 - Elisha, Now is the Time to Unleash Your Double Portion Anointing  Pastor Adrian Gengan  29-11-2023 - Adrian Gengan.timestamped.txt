[2:45] Elisha am amen yes amen and they came to
[2:49] meet him and they bowed themselves to
[2:50] the ground before him one more portion
[2:52] of scripture before you be seated John
[2:55] 14 amen verse 12
[2:58] amen says verily verily I say unto you
[3:02] he that believeth on me the works that I

[3:09] Works than the shall he do because I go
[3:11] unto my father amen the Lord had
[3:14] blessings to the reading of his word may
[3:15] be seated
[3:17] amen amen for a little title we'll call
[3:20] it am
[3:22] Elisha now is the time to unleash your
[3:26] double portion anointing hallelujah amen
[3:29] hallelujah
[3:31] amen we we read here the ministry of
[3:34] Elisha is
[3:37] starting where Elijah leaves off but
[3:40] what a powerful way he starts his
[3:42] ministry he doesn't start it casually
[3:46] amen Elijah goes up to heaven and he
[3:50] starts his ministry by striking the
[3:52] waters with the
[3:54] mantle amen so he continues with the
[3:57] same dynamics that Elijah was operating
[3:59] in in
[4:01] amen yes amen amen the same way we just
[4:06] read St John 14:12 The Works that I do
[4:08] shall he do also our lord Jesus has gone
[4:11] away but he wants the church oh yes to
[4:16] continue the ministry amen with the same
[4:19] Dynamics amen
[4:21] hallelujah here what the prophet is
[4:23] saying now so I'm saying Elisha now is
[4:25] the time to unleash your double portion
[4:27] anointing here what the prophet is
[4:28] saying now so the how has come for the
[4:31] repeat of the Bible am and the
[4:34] fulfilling of the word God promised that
[4:37] he was going to send the former rain and
[4:39] the latter rain and he promised the
[4:42] former and the latter in the latter
[4:46] rain amen everybody following along amen
[4:50] there's going to come two Reigns but the
[4:52] two Reigns are going to come in the
[4:53] latter rain Amen in other words a double
[4:57] portion amen amen
[5:00] hallelujah amen if you if you kind of
[5:04] wish that you weren't in the program of
[5:05] God with what he's doing now then maybe
[5:07] you should have Liv back in the church
[5:09] ages amen justification would have been
[5:11] good enough amen just protesting the
[5:15] Catholic Church would have been good
[5:16] enough amen maybe you wanted to live in
[5:19] the days of Wesley amen going around
[5:21] preaching sanctification and Holiness
[5:23] message maybe that would have uh amen
[5:25] filled your cup amen maybe the early
[5:28] outpouring of Pentecost amen the
[5:30] outpouring of the gifts upon theza
[5:32] Street and the early Believers maybe you
[5:33] would have fancied that amen but I'm not
[5:35] pilled for such a Time amen those things
[5:38] don't satisfy me amen I'm here to
[5:40] fulfill all of God's
[5:42] word am
[5:44] amen and not only I'm here to make it
[5:47] manifest amen if I don't see it manifest
[5:51] something is wrong that's I'm built and
[5:53] designed to make the word manifest
[5:56] amen amen so he says like the Garment to
[5:59] Elijah Elisha when Elijah dropped it
[6:02] Elisha picked up and had a double
[6:06] portion he was a type of the church and
[6:10] Christ Christ was taken up and the same
[6:13] spirit that was upon Christ is upon the
[6:15] church tonight the Holy Ghost amen
[6:19] amen amen so if the same spirit that was
[6:22] on Christ was healing the blind man
[6:25] raising healing the crle man raising the
[6:27] dead man creating eyeballs if the Same
[6:30] Spirit was on Jesus ought to be upon the
[6:33] believer Amen brother bam tells us that
[6:35] Elijah only performed I think he says
[6:37] four Miracles but Elisha performed eight
[6:39] a double portion oh thank you Lord thank
[6:43] you
[6:44] Lord amen thank you Lord if you
[6:47] understand what I'm telling you for too
[6:48] long youve you've lingered in admiration
[6:51] not realizing that you have the mantle
[6:54] you're not realizing you have the double
[6:56] portion amen I tell you if you had to
[6:58] call brother Brandon here and you ask
[7:00] him would you want us to idolize you and
[7:02] the works that God did in your ministry
[7:04] he'll say not so take the bet on and go
[7:07] on amen amen Greater Works than the
[7:09] shall he do amen amen because when he
[7:13] came the church was weak the church was
[7:15] powerless the church was
[7:18] fearful when he started his ministry
[7:21] amen here was another David he had come
[7:23] to the denominational camp but the
[7:25] church was fear fearful amen they had
[7:28] seen pocket of
[7:30] Revival amen but this was the latter
[7:33] rain God was going to pour out his
[7:35] spirit amen God was going to Not only
[7:37] was he going to pour His spirit amen
[7:39] hallelujah let me tell you Luther is not
[7:41] prophesied in the Bible as a one man
[7:44] scripture neither is Wesley prophesied
[7:46] in the Bible as a on man
[7:48] scripture amen hallelujah
[7:51] yes that's right amen but there's one
[7:54] man prophesied amen in Malachi 4: 5 and
[7:57] 6 that his min was going to turn our
[8:00] hearts Luther's message can't turn my
[8:02] heart neither can Wesley's message turn
[8:04] my heart but this prophet of Malachi 4:
[8:07] 5 and six this prophet of Revelation
[8:09] 10:7 he turned my heart I can't even say
[8:12] that he is going to turn my heart
[8:15] because that is a blind seeing to a
[8:17] glass Darkly how long are we going to
[8:19] say the prophet is going to turn our
[8:21] hearts wake up blind lat us see and
[8:24] message people amen our hearts have
[8:26] already been turned back amen yes amen
[8:29] to what the faith what are we going to
[8:30] do with the faith unleash the faith amen
[8:33] amen yes amen the faith our hearts are
[8:37] not turned back to a faith for us to
[8:39] pickle it and to study Doctrine yes yes
[8:42] and to Rejoice around
[8:44] Mysteries the mystery came to take away
[8:47] the Amnesia and reveal who you are as a
[8:49] son and daughter of God Amen we are to
[8:52] be a powerful church we are to be a
[8:54] Church on the Move amen we are to be a a
[8:56] conduit of the holy spirit amen where
[8:59] the current of the Holy Spirit can flow
[9:01] through US yes Lord amen I'm afraid too
[9:04] many people have put conductors upon the
[9:06] holy spirit I only want a certain
[9:08] wattage of the Holy Spirit I don't want
[9:10] the full power of the holy
[9:13] spirit amen some people if the holy feel
[9:16] if they get the Holy Spirit on them
[9:17] they'll blow a fuse can't handle the
[9:19] power can't handle the anointing amen
[9:22] but you and I are designed to handle the
[9:23] power amen amen how much power give me
[9:26] the full power amen give me the full
[9:29] power of the Holy
[9:31] Ghost amen hallelujah amen we don't want
[9:34] a partial understanding a partial
[9:36] realization we are here for the fullness
[9:38] of time
[9:40] amen amen
[9:44] hallelujah praise the Lord
[9:48] amen so the same spirit that was on
[9:51] Christ if you go to read the Bible read
[9:53] it again read the gospels again see how
[9:55] the spirit is operating amen same
[9:58] potential ought to be in new amen amen
[10:01] hallelujah so the Bible becomes a new
[10:03] book denominational view looks at it in
[10:06] [Music]
[10:09] amazement but our view says I can do it
[10:13] because it's the same Spirit In Me amen
[10:15] amen hallelujah hallelujah so he says
[10:19] three stages that Elisha followed Elijah
[10:22] and Elijah was the type of Christ Elisha
[10:24] the type of the church I go up to gilgal
[10:27] First justification by faith and then he
[10:30] said now you stay here you stay with the
[10:34] lutherans but Elisha said not
[10:37] so amen Elisha and Elijah The Young and
[10:41] the old Prophet a type of Christ in the
[10:43] church he said as my soul lives I'll not
[10:46] stay here but I'm going with you yes
[10:51] that's why we added two more verses too

[10:57] Justified because because we have moved
[10:59] past
[11:00] justification amen hallelujah am praise
[11:04] the
[11:06] Lord and he went up to gilgal and when
[11:08] he got up there he says now you stay
[11:10] here the Lord is calling me to go to the
[11:12] school of the
[11:14] prophets and so he said as the Lord
[11:17] lives and your soul never die I'm going
[11:20] with you amen I'll not leave
[11:24] you see that's the church keep your eyes
[11:27] on Jesus wherever he moves if he goes

[11:32] with him if he goes out of the Baptist
[11:35] Church go right on with him amen he goes
[11:37] out of brandom Tabernacle go right on
[11:39] with him I'll not leave you amen

[13:47] stages of the journey after we Cross

[15:18] Lord he says that's what the church
[15:20] ought to be doing T doing tonight for a
[15:23] double portion of the spirit is watching
[15:25] Christ watching the Holy Ghost the way

[15:53] fivefold because where is the Holy Ghost

[44:37] understand what I'm saying she finds a
[44:39] man who has respect for the man of God
[44:42] the shite woman and she wants to do
[44:45] something for the man of
[44:48] God sometimes our blessings are

[44:53] man of God yes some people already know
[44:55] this amen amen amen amen hallelujah you
[44:58] know that brother son is already

[45:17] bless him she had respect to the man of
[45:19] God and wanted to do something for the
[45:21] man of God

[45:26] connected by doing something for the man
[45:28] of God so what she did she built a room
[45:30] for him
[45:32] yes
[45:34] amen and she fed him you read in verse 8
[45:38] she constrained him to eat
[45:40] bread and not only once the Bible says

[48:32] influence over the king and the Army and
[48:34] he's offering protection of the army but
[48:36] he's also offering favor of the king
[48:38] basically he's asking her if you really
[48:40] want I can set you up in the natural
[48:45] economy and she answered I dwell among
[48:47] my own

[49:02] thee amen what can I do for you amen
[49:05] it's a Ministry of servitude it's a

[49:56] in at the door and he says about this
[49:58] season according to the time of life
[50:00] thou shall Embrace a son and that sounds
[50:04] so
[50:09] familiar so Elisha has a Ministry to
[50:13] make the barren woman
[50:16] conceive you see some of you got friends

[51:18] connected with the angel of the Lord
[51:20] that's what I'm trying to tell you I
[51:21] said where these words sound so familiar
[51:23] because the angel of the Lord uses the
[51:24] exact
[51:27] words didn't he tell that to AA you
[51:30] shall have a son and his name Shall be
[51:31] Called ishmail didn't he tell that to

[51:50] the one amen
[51:52] hallelujah he's the one that Adam like
[51:55] like like what Adam was supposed to
[51:56] manifest but now the angel of the Lord
[51:58] would show them how to operate the
[52:01] power because Elisha let me tell you if
[52:04] you didn't know I told you in a veiled
[52:06] way that he could see the supernatural
[52:07] World Elisha is connected to the angel
[52:10] of the
[52:11] Lord am if you are seeing Elisha operate
[52:15] in the double portion anointing it's not
[52:17] on his own
[52:20] strength Elisha is connected to the
[52:23] angel of the Lord
[52:25] come on now Mark
[52:28] 11:23 the 11 th000 Gentile workers
[52:31] connected with the angel of the
[52:33] Lord that's how they are doing the
[52:35] Greater Works that's right about the
[52:38] season according to the time of life
[52:40] thou shallal Embrace a
[52:46] son what did he ask you before this what
[52:49] do you want now he's being so
[52:52] specific not you going to have a baby

[53:03] you you're going to have a
[53:05] son and she said n my Lord thou man of
[53:08] God do not lie unto thine
[53:11] handmate you see and the woman conceived
[53:15] and bear his son at that season that
[53:17] Elisha had said unto her according to
[53:19] the time of life
[53:22] amen praise the Lord amen now we know in
[53:25] the progression of the story amen we
[53:27] don't have too much time to go into this

[53:36] Time amen you'll find there that the
[53:38] Harvesters are in the field the boy dies
[53:40] at Harvest
[53:46] Time and then let's go to draw verse
[53:50] 26 verse 26 this is the famous one year
[53:53] now where gazi is asking the shite woman

[54:29] stuff and go place it on the boy's
[54:32] head now the mother of the child in
[54:35] verse 30 says this and the mother of the
[54:38] child said as the Lord liveth and as thy
[54:41] soul liveth I will not leave
