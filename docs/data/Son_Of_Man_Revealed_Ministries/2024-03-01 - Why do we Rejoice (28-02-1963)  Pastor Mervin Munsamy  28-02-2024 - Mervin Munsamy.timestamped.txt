[0:35] said amen prise the Lord
[0:39] amen that was
[0:45] wonderful and seriously uh most of the
[0:47] quotations you've already
[0:51] taken but nevertheless let's stand amen
[0:54] praise the
[0:55] lord it's also going to read Revelation
[0:58] 10:7 but
[1:00] since we've we've gone through that
[1:02] scripture let's just read um 1
[1:04] Thessalonians chapter 4 amen praise the
[1:10] Lord and the Bible says in verse 16 for
[1:13] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:16] heaven with a shout hallelujah with the
[1:18] voice of the Archangel and with the
[1:20] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:22] shall rise first then we which are alive
[1:25] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:27] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[1:29] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[1:33] the Lord let's bow for prayer thank you
[1:35] Lord father we thank you for this
[1:36] wonderful anointing that we find in this
[1:40] in this place tonight Lord in your house
[1:42] we thank you for what has been said thus
[1:44] far Lord we pray oh God that you would
[1:46] continue to move in the hearts of the
[1:48] people Lord we pray that even as we
[1:50] would further just touch on a few
[1:52] thoughts tonight every Minister having
[1:54] his own uh way and method of bringing
[1:57] the message across we ask father that
[1:59] you will be our portion and strength as
[2:01] we look to you in the name of the Lord
[2:03] Jesus Christ and all God's people said
[2:05] amen you may take your
[2:10] seat so now that we've been
[2:13] given a most wonderful presentation yes
[2:17] of what the 28th of February 1963 was
[2:22] what does that mean for you and I amen
[2:24] amen what's the purpose of Us coming
[2:27] here together was it just another day
[2:29] for have
[2:30] church but so why do we Rejoice what are
[2:34] we making all this noise about but let
[2:36] me start off by saying something like
[2:38] this we are not human beings having a
[2:42] spiritual experience but we Are
[2:44] Spiritual Beings having a human
[2:47] experience amen because we come we we
[2:50] come from God and we're going back to
[2:52] God amenu and do you realize tonight
[2:55] that without us God is incomplete amen
[2:59] Hallelujah that is why there had to be a
[3:01] Redemption story once we were broken our
[3:04] fellowship was broken with God in the
[3:06] Garden of Eden amen there had to be a
[3:10] restoration and sometimes we think that
[3:13] the the calvary the death on the cross
[3:17] was it yes but Redemption didn't stop
[3:20] death church amen hallelujah 38th of
[3:23] February 1963 is also our symbol of
[3:27] redemption hallelujah hallelujah
[3:30] we love him tonight separated us so what
[3:33] we can we can say tonight if we want to
[3:37] we our precious Pastor Denzel say that
[3:39] this was a supernatural
[3:41] experience but guess what we are
[3:44] supernatural
[3:45] beings Hallelujah we are just
[3:47] tabernacling in this natural fish
[3:50] waiting for us to have a body change
[3:52] hallelujah amen so we thank the Lord for
[3:55] the way it was presented amen but you
[3:57] see our inherent quality forget about
[4:00] this flesh that you in we're going to
[4:02] get rid of it one day that is not the
[4:04] real you Hallelujah but the real you has
[4:09] a DNA that desires Supernatural
[4:12] things Supernatural things so our DNA
[4:16] has been designed to digest Supernatural
[4:19] things that is why when we hear the
[4:22] things we are hearing it excites us amen
[4:26] because our our theophany that's on that
[4:28] side is getting excited because one time
[4:31] we're going to let go of this Natural
[4:33] Body amen and take on another one
[4:36] hallelujah hallelujah we had brother
[4:38] brandham on the on the earth and we had
[4:41] had an Ang seven angels that were there
[4:44] at a representation of of both yes so we
[4:47] thank the Lord tonight for the things
[4:49] that we have heard but we also realize
[4:51] there'll be much critics when it comes
[4:53] to these things as we hear our pastors
[4:55] say because you can't teach Supernatural
[4:58] things to Pentecostal Bab amen
[5:00] hallelujah so you must get this message
[5:04] has to go to the allall of critics amen
[5:07] but we are those ones chosen at the end
[5:09] time to show forth this message we don't
[5:12] prove it with our mouths we prove it
[5:14] with our lives hallelujah amen thank you
[5:17] Lord Glory thank you Lord so this is a
[5:19] great time because it's the greatest age
[5:21] of deception Hallelujah and we have the
[5:25] the opportunity and we can if we're not
[5:28] wise and prudent we're going to find
[5:30] ourselves getting into a place if we're
[5:33] not wise and alert we're going to find
[5:35] ourselves allowing the coldness that
[5:38] comes with all the negativity to make
[5:41] our faith muscles defeat amen but the
[5:45] word tonight has been yet to grow our
[5:47] faith
[5:48] mus to get us into a rapturing condition
[5:52] because we realize that even as God is
[5:54] gathering a bride this Antichrist spirit
[5:57] is also Gathering a BRI Hallelujah yes
[6:00] and we find even on on a slide that
[6:02] we've got just some simple thoughts
[6:04] tonight about the definition of a cloud
[6:08] why do we Rejoice
[6:11] yes Am A Cloud by the definition is a
[6:17] mass of water
[6:18] drops right or or ice crystals suspended
[6:22] in an atmosphere but we've already heard
[6:25] tonight that this was not
[6:28] that amen
[6:29] it was no water
[6:31] drops because if that was the case in
[6:34] that seven days we would probably had
[6:36] rain amen but we had clear skies and
[6:39] these angelic wings made this cloud in
[6:41] the sky amen hallelujah amen but what we
[6:45] find the biblical definition of the word
[6:48] cloud is covering and we heard tonight
[6:51] that it's a covenant amen and it's a
[6:54] covering for us and we realized that
[6:57] that constellation of seven angels is
[7:00] the work of the Holy Ghost through seven
[7:01] Church
[7:02] ages amen and this is not the first time
[7:06] as we heard that these things have
[7:07] happened but God has been using the
[7:10] supernatural right through Biblical
[7:12] scriptures right now and God doesn't
[7:14] change his pth hallelujah hallelujah
[7:16] amen so this is something that should
[7:18] not excite us to a point where we in awe
[7:22] because we should know this is how God
[7:25] operates amen amen for others miracles
[7:29] are H H something out of the ordinary
[7:32] but for God it's his lifestyle praise
[7:35] the Lorden and that's the way we ought
[7:36] to get amen is get up into that
[7:39] Supernatural this is this Cloud was a
[7:41] covering amen and we heard uh you know
[7:45] in the scripture when came to Mary it
[7:46] was the Holy Ghost that overshadowed
[7:49] her and the Holy Ghost is shadowing the
[7:52] end time bride up until the Rapture come
[7:55] takes place so if you're worried about
[7:58] what's happening in the Earth today you
[7:59] worried about the economy you're worried
[8:01] about the violence worried about what's
[8:03] going to happen with the political
[8:05] system you don't need to worry about all
[8:07] of those things amen they have been
[8:09] ordained to do those things Hallelujah
[8:12] but God has made available a covering to
[8:15] take you into the hallelujah hallelujah
[8:19] amen so you find that as we heard as we
[8:22] would have heard previously and we heard
[8:23] tonight that there's a lot of
[8:25] controversy around this Cloud yes amen
[8:28] and there's much more material on the
[8:31] critics than they is about the original
[8:35] things but we don't mind because we
[8:39] enjoy being in the
[8:41] minority because we typing scripture
[8:43] amen so we heard about Noah and and uh
[8:47] uh how Noah would have looked in those
[8:49] days building an ark being ridiculed
[8:53] because it was not something that a man
[8:56] with wisdom would do there's no water
[8:59] why on Earth would you want to build an
[9:01] ark but you see for the people of that
[9:04] day it was
[9:05] foolishness but for Noah he was
[9:08] following the word for his day praise
[9:11] the Lord so following this message at a
[9:13] time especially for our young people
[9:15] tonight yes may seem foolish but
[9:19] nonetheless it's the word of the lord
[9:21] it's the very thing that's going to take
[9:22] us into the
[9:25] Lurch if go if in Noah's day the ark is
[9:29] God saved no one's family amen the
[9:32] message of the hour is that up to us
[9:34] that's going to take us into the Rapture
[9:36] hallelujah amen so we saw that uh so
[9:40] there's a lot of critics out there yes
[9:42] but we need to have the faith today
[9:44] today for what to tell them you too late
[9:48] amen
[9:50] hallelujah because there will be people
[9:52] that will continuously as the the the
[9:55] Rapture reaches its climax will continue
[9:58] to think of everything they can to try
[10:00] and discourage you in your walk with God
[10:03] yes Hallelujah and maybe you might not
[10:05] be able to come across like pre like the
[10:07] preachers to come and defend the word
[10:10] you don't need to do
[10:11] that God takes care of those battles as
[10:14] long as you whatever little word you
[10:16] have in you you are able to live that
[10:18] out for the glory of God hallelujah so
[10:20] today we are excited we are rejoicing
[10:23] because this Cloud that came on the 28th
[10:25] of February 1963 is a covering to the
[10:28] Bride of Jesus
[10:29] hallelujah amen now we also Rejoice
[10:32] because this cloud is a sign of
[10:35] purification how do we know that because
[10:38] the month of February right the the
[10:41] months of the year are are named after
[10:43] the Roman gods and you find that the
[10:46] month of February comes from a Roman
[10:48] Festival of purification called
[10:52] februar right so I don't think it's
[10:54] strange that God chose the month of
[10:57] February to show for discovering Amen on
[11:01] the 28th of February
[11:03] 1963 because God was bringing pration to
[11:06] his bride at the end time why he's
[11:09] washing us By the Waters of the world
[11:11] Hallelujah wonderful washing Us by the
[11:14] water of his word amen so we are we are
[11:17] just so excited because tonight this
[11:20] message is just not not we Rejoice
[11:23] because we are being washed By the
[11:24] Waters of the word amen aren't you glad
[11:27] tonight to be in this message Hallelujah
[11:29] you mustn't just sing this me this the
[11:31] song I'm only in this message by Grace
[11:34] but your life must live there out
[11:37] because really what is the message the
[11:39] message is the life of Jesus Christ
[11:41] being displayed from the life of a
[11:43] Believer that's what it is we can hear
[11:46] all these wonderful things but when we
[11:47] go out here if we cannot reflect Jesus
[11:50] Christ then this Cloud can either be a
[11:54] bullboard for Christ or it can be
[11:56] a amen that's really what it is we can
[11:59] rejoice in the good things about the
[12:01] things that we hear and how everything
[12:03] types up and this and and all of those
[12:05] things those are lovely things which we
[12:06] love to hear but brother B
[12:10] says I I don't care whether my shoes yes
[12:15] matches my shirt or my tie matches my
[12:18] touses but I want my experience to match
[12:21] the
[12:22] world tonight this is why we're here we
[12:26] rejoicing because we want the word to
[12:28] change Us in such a way that we become
[12:30] that word and in that way God is
[12:33] glorified hallelujah amen we Rejoice
[12:36] tonight
[12:38] because In This Cloud we see Redemption
[12:42] amen
[12:44] yes we see Redemption and when Pastor
[12:48] Denzel was going down the RO I said
[12:49] don't you don't
[12:52] you but in a simple way uh tonight
[12:56] um in the in the in the message the
[12:59] absolute which he he spoke about
[13:00] preached on the 4th of March
[13:02] 1963 brother bam tells us about Ted
[13:05] kerman's sister Sylvia uh Ares who sent
[13:09] a telegram to uh sent a telegram to the
[13:11] prophet regarding a son Pastor Danel
[13:14] spoke about that who was what age at the
[13:17] time 28 years old
[13:21] amen he was 28 years old at the time and
[13:25] um so what had happened was they
[13:29] on um him and his the girl that he was
[13:32] with they were on trial for the murder
[13:34] of an estate agent named Fred
[13:37] tonis okay so at the time if you
[13:42] committed those kind of capital crimes
[13:44] it meant the death penalty yes so here
[13:47] is a mother who's praying and trusting
[13:51] the Lord and wants the prophet to come
[13:53] because he knows that there is something
[13:55] Supernatural about the message that he
[13:58] brings amen amen do you believe that
[14:01] there's something Supernatural about
[14:02] this
[14:04] message are you looking for the word
[14:06] when you get into those dark situations
[14:09] are you looking for this message to come
[14:12] amen when when when you're going through
[14:14] a rough time you may listen to all kinds
[14:16] of things but when you're going through
[14:18] a a rough time you want to listen to the
[14:19] voice of the seventh angel why because
[14:22] you know in your the real you that they
[14:24] this word is true Hallelujah so you find
[14:28] that there's a Praying Mother that now
[14:31] gets the calls the prophet on the scene
[14:34] and this is not the first time this has
[14:36] happened in the Bible or in the ministry
[14:38] of the prophet and then you find that
[14:41] they have a prayer meeting calling on
[14:43] the name of the Lord for the Lord to
[14:45] come and make a way now remember
[14:46] according to the law of that day yes the
[14:50] crime was that they would go through uh
[14:53] the death sentence yes right very
[14:56] similar to like the woman who was caught
[14:58] in adultery yeah there was already a
[15:01] dead sentence according to the law but
[15:03] Jesus on the scene changed the
[15:06] situation and when these Saints of that
[15:08] day began to pray and call on the name
[15:10] of the Lord what we soon
[15:12] find that 4
[15:15] hours 4 hours before they was to put
[15:19] this man to death by the electric chair
[15:22] the court overturned the decision amen
[15:25] hallelujah hallelujah amen now you'll
[15:28] notice is 4 hours and four speaks of
[15:32] Deliverance Hallelujah so god is perfect
[15:35] in everything that he
[15:36] does and guess what this young man got
[15:39] as as an alternative to the electric
[15:41] chair death he got a life
[15:46] sentence you got that tonight you got a
[15:48] life sentence and amen with the what
[15:51] happened on the 28th of February
[15:53] 1963 we got us also got a sentence we
[15:57] got an eternal life sentence
[15:59] amenu because the word being revealed in
[16:01] our day the Mysteries that has been hid
[16:04] before the foundations of the Earth
[16:05] being revealed in this hour has brought
[16:08] what taken us from death into
[16:11] life so that is why we Rejoice because
[16:14] we know this natural life is only a
[16:17] perversion but we realize that we are
[16:19] from eternity and we are Desiring to go
[16:21] back to Eternity hallelujah amen so we
[16:25] find that this was Redemption outplaying
[16:30] itself praise the Lord
[16:34] amen thank you
[16:36] Lord the cloud why we Rejoice tonight is
[16:41] that this cloud is proof that this
[16:44] message is true Hallelujah yes
[16:46] absolutely it is true amen and we heard
[16:49] it beautifully from the previous speaker
[16:52] that this message is true it is
[16:54] perfectly aligned to the
[16:55] scriptures but wait it the the the the
[16:59] challenge lie it now needs to be aligned
[17:02] with our
[17:03] lives because the mystery of the Seven
[17:05] Seals can be has been fully completed
[17:08] and opened by the prophet it's finished
[17:11] the scripture says and maybe in your
[17:13] church that Ministry could be finished
[17:17] but is it finished in
[17:18] you that's what what it really matters
[17:21] because we can be rejoicing and saying
[17:23] Amen to the word but if that word has
[17:25] not changed us and prepared us for a
[17:27] body change then I'm sorry we cannot
[17:30] Rejoice tonight it's not true
[17:33] rejoicing the woman um in John 4:24 we
[17:36] hear about the woman at the well and the
[17:38] scripture there tells us that God is a
[17:41] spirit and they that worship Him must
[17:44] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[17:47] truth is speaking about our Doctrine
[17:49] worshiping the Lord and only in true
[17:51] worship can only come by the right drct
[17:54] now you know church I always thought
[17:57] that you know as I was GR growing up as
[17:58] a young man I was involved in the
[18:00] ministry from a very young age but in
[18:02] the uh denominational uh Church system
[18:06] and you know being involved in a lot of
[18:08] house meetings and doing a lot of
[18:10] Outreach and Hospital visitations and
[18:14] you you feel very religious when you're
[18:16] doing those kind of things and those
[18:18] things do have a place in the word
[18:20] because they come from the word but I
[18:23] always thought that that was the
[18:24] father's
[18:25] business I was going about my father's
[18:28] business each day doing all these kind
[18:29] of things but it took a prophet at the
[18:32] end time to come and say that is not the
[18:35] father's business but if you're about
[18:37] your father's business it's there to
[18:39] seek out and search out those Mysteries
[18:41] that were hidden before the foundations
[18:43] of the earth and that is the father's
[18:45] business amen amen hallelujah
[18:49] hallelujah amen so this woman at the
[18:52] well when she received uh um her message
[18:56] when she came to the realization of not
[18:58] only who he was but who she is it didn't
[19:01] matter the natural circumstances which
[19:03] you were so aware of previously made no
[19:07] uh effect on her thereafter the same
[19:10] people that she was trying to hide from
[19:12] she ran towards them amen hallelujah she
[19:16] moved from hiding to now a running
[19:18] running billboard for for the Lord Jesus
[19:21] Christ amen why she realized that within
[19:24] her there was something much greater
[19:26] have you come to that place tonight to
[19:28] realize no matter what challenges that
[19:30] you might be facing in this time no
[19:32] matter whatever family problems you
[19:34] might be having or issues at work and
[19:36] all of those things because that's what
[19:37] is boil to we cannot divorce God from
[19:40] any area of Our
[19:42] Lives all these things will be good to
[19:45] hear but if it doesn't do a change in
[19:47] you then God's word is not
[19:50] alive you are the ones that prove that
[19:53] Jesus is Alive in our day amen praise
[19:56] the Lord amen because we understand that
[19:59] we are living in this hour and you know
[20:02] put it to you this way every single
[20:05] saint of God and man of God Through the
[20:08] Bible prophets and major and minor
[20:11] prophets would have been so delighted to
[20:15] see the Fulfillment of our
[20:17] day amen I can just imagining imagining
[20:21] them having this discussions by
[20:23] themselves to try and understand what's
[20:25] happening on the earth amen but I
[20:28] believe that God knew that in the
[20:31] seventh leian age yes there will be a
[20:35] people amen that will be built in such a
[20:38] way that they will be able to digest the
[20:41] full word amen and those people is
[20:45] actually you and I to amen and I believe
[20:50] and I'm sure you'll agree with me as
[20:51] much as we respect every major and minor
[20:53] Prophet that has been before but I
[20:55] believe from my experience with this
[20:57] message message that William Mar and
[21:00] brandham is the greatest prophet of all
[21:02] time amen hallelujah but why should we
[21:04] Rejoice with that we don't stop it just
[21:06] there because if he was the greatest
[21:08] prophet of all time then it makes us the
[21:11] greatest bride of all time we can
[21:13] Rejoice Hallelujah because when that
[21:15] which is perfect is come then that which
[21:18] is in part is done away the perfect word
[21:21] for this end time has come how to do
[21:23] what to prepare a bride for Rapture amen
[21:28] there won't be an eighth age as our our
[21:30] precious um uh U uh pastor had made
[21:34] mentioned many are looking for an eighth
[21:37] messenger but we know that that's just a
[21:40] perversion in the Feast of the trumpets
[21:42] there's a quotation in the prayer
[21:43] brother Bram says that he speaks about
[21:47] um an eighth messenger and one can
[21:49] actually if you don't not careful you
[21:52] could think that and believe that
[21:53] there's an eight messenger but then
[21:55] further he goes on to say that messenger
[21:58] messenger the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the
[22:01] messenger being the Holy Ghost has been
[22:03] always down through seven Church ages
[22:06] amen amen there is no seventh Church age
[22:10] uh an eighth Church age the seventh age
[22:13] is the last and the eighth is eternity
[22:15] amen that's why we thank the Lord for
[22:17] his great love and Tender Mercies
[22:19] towards us so this me message we Rejoice
[22:21] tonight because this cloud is proof that
[22:24] this message is true amen we just do do
[22:27] um I know time has gone we'll just do uh
[22:30] the quote that's thereafter okay let's
[22:32] just go I think I I added a definition
[22:34] of Supernatural there let's just go
[22:35] there
[22:38] quickly just to help you understand that
[22:41] the definition of Supernatural means
[22:43] that something is beyond and above the
[22:45] natural right and this is where God
[22:49] operates amen okay A Realm where Heaven
[22:53] and Earth
[22:54] intermingle you see you were not born to
[22:58] fot into this world but you were born to
[23:00] stand out that is your ministry upon the
[23:03] Earth while while we wait for the Lord
[23:05] to come to stand out to be different to
[23:08] be that peculiar people to be that royal
[23:10] priesthood that is the word working in
[23:12] you am amen so we find where Heaven and
[23:15] Earth intermingle that's the type of
[23:17] relationship and that's the type your of
[23:19] life that you should live each day where
[23:22] Heaven and Earth intermingle but really
[23:25] it refers to something unexplainable yes
[23:28] so if you are intermingling or having
[23:31] fellowship with people who are trying to
[23:33] explain God you rather cut your
[23:34] fellowship off because there are many
[23:37] things that you cannot explain about God
[23:40] Amen and is blessed are those that have
[23:42] not seen yet they believe amen so God is
[23:45] Supernatural and if God is Supernatural
[23:48] and brother Bram says that if you take a
[23:50] teaspoon of ocean water even though you
[23:53] have such a small quantity whatever is
[23:55] in the teaspoon is the same properties
[23:57] that in that ocean amen so today if you
[24:01] have that spirit of God in you amen you
[24:04] as I said God is incomplete without you
[24:06] that makes you Church you are
[24:09] Supernatural the Lord amen let's go to
[24:12] the first quote there we might won't go
[24:13] through every one of them but in the
[24:15] message Shalom the prophet says and
[24:18] there stood those seven angels just as
[24:21] natural as you see me standing here yes
[24:23] so this was not just as natural as you
[24:26] see me standing here so this was not
[24:29] some figment of somebody's
[24:31] imagination amen if you believe the
[24:33] prophet then you have to believe what
[24:35] the prophet says is true you have to
[24:37] come to that place where William Man
[24:39] brandham by yourself is in your heart
[24:42] you know that he's God's Propet for this
[24:44] day otherwise everything else will be a
[24:46] glare and you'll find that today yeah we
[24:49] reading tonight he says and just as
[24:52] natural something tangible something
[24:54] that you can feel it's real right as you
[24:57] can see standing here and told me to
[24:59] return to my home that the Mysteries
[25:02] that the reformers down Through the Ages
[25:05] had failed to pick up
[25:08] amen so you're living in a age though
[25:11] naturally there may be so much of
[25:13] Destruction but we living in an age
[25:15] where there's no
[25:17] failures Hallelujah there's no failures
[25:19] because you got a perfect word for a
[25:21] perfect church for a for a Perfect Bride
[25:25] Hallelujah right the Mysteries that the
[25:27] reformers Through the Ages had failed to
[25:29] pick up the mysteries of the Bible which
[25:31] Seven Seals held would be revealed and
[25:34] then he says I challenge anybody get
[25:37] those Seven Seals and look over them
[25:40] right and find a fault with them find a
[25:43] fault Hallelujah you're going to have a
[25:45] rough time with that amen because
[25:48] everyone would try to disprove uh the
[25:51] Lord they either became a believer of
[25:54] this message amen or they Fallen by the
[25:56] wayside one of the too amen because this
[25:59] is this message is rapturing Faith amen
[26:02] so you find he says because it's given
[26:05] by inspiration by God Amen so this
[26:08] message is not from Kentucky amen it's
[26:11] not from America amen it's not from your
[26:14] church but it's from the Throne of God
[26:17] Amen Hallelujah get up to to Rapture a a
[26:20] bride for for the Lord amen you must
[26:23] remember he also says uh in many of the
[26:26] of the messages that the opening of The
[26:28] Seven Seals brought open to to to book
[26:31] many Mysteries one of their marriage and
[26:33] divorce am and what you find that at the
[26:36] beginning there was a marriage yes and
[26:38] there was also a divorce and it must
[26:40] type up at the end where there's a
[26:42] marriage and there's a divorce as well
[26:44] amen and many of us maybe not understand
[26:47] this but the marriage takes place on
[26:49] Earth and we all when we Rejoice about a
[26:53] a natural wedding we can't lie we always
[26:56] think about the meal that's going to
[26:57] come so you should Also spiritually be
[27:00] wondering about the meal to come because
[27:01] it's a mar supper that we are fixing to
[27:04] go and our transport to get there is
[27:06] this message of the hour hallelujah
[27:08] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[27:10] right so because it was given by
[27:12] inspiration from God prior to that I
[27:14] preached on the seven Church ages and
[27:17] then draw them out on the Blackboard in
[27:19] my Tabernacle what happened there was
[27:23] the Holy Ghost Amen in that meeting came
[27:27] and drew the entire church ages amen the
[27:31] the golden candlesticks at the back of
[27:33] the church what does that mean the
[27:36] message that you are have access to is a
[27:38] supernatural message why it's been
[27:41] inspired by
[27:43] God to take a bride from the death of
[27:46] sin to eternal life Lord amen am so if
[27:50] you can see these things you're looking
[27:51] for for for proof there is proof that
[27:55] you can get recorded proof of how this
[27:57] message is true there's many quotes I'll
[28:00] just do the last one and then we'll hand
[28:02] over to the to the next sorry this
[28:04] number
[28:07] two okay and so in the message it is the
[28:10] rising of the Sun in paragraph 12 the
[28:12] prophet says and so he he spoke to me
[28:16] and said the Seven Seals will be opened
[28:18] the seven Mysteries Sevenfold Mysteries
[28:20] of the Bible that's been closed up since
[28:22] the foundation of the world will be
[28:25] revealed amen right and yet and we yet
[28:29] humble little group compared with all
[28:31] the
[28:32] world yes we've always been taking pride
[28:36] in being the minority
[28:38] amen and we yet a humble group compared
[28:41] with the world we've enjoyed these
[28:43] blessings hearing those Mysteries
[28:46] marriage and divorce serpent seed and
[28:49] all different questions has completely
[28:51] revealed to us not by men but by God
[28:56] this is a message not by man so those
[28:59] people that are trying to prove that
[29:00] we're worshiping a man sorry you're too
[29:02] late this is a message by God himself
[29:05] amen God himself that's open those seven
[29:09] mysteries of what the church was how it
[29:12] was in Christ at the beginning and how
[29:15] it will be revealed in the last days
[29:17] let's give the Lord hand of
[29:21] Praise
[29:23] hallelujah
[29:25] amen
