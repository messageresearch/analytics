hallelujah thank you Father ABA father we love you we appreciate you we ask oh God that the will of the father be done now on Earth even as it is in heaven oh God Amen we've assembled ourselves

you Lord Jesus and I pray Lord we'll open up our hearts our minds our understanding Lord to your word forgive us Lord where we faulted and failed along the way Lord maybe sometimes in this human flesh we maybe even unknowingly have said or done things Lord to displease you but we are Sons oh God who can submit to you and say we are sorry Lord Jesus forgive us wash us and cleanse us and I pray Lord your sweet holy spirit will come and find an Abiding Place in our hearts thank you Father pray Lord for the hearer of the word now Lord that you would anoint them oh God anoint the hearers to hear

faith will arise in the hearts of your people those that have needs your lord by the end of the service Lord they would have had their needs met Lord Jesus father we'll be able to say in our hearts didn't our hearts burn within us even as he spoke with us along the way Lord Jesus father we come against every evil spirit that's lurking around you Lord every evil spirit Lord that's hanging around we bind those spirits in the mighty name of Jesus we give Liberty to the Holy Spirit even our own bodies we give you access now holy spirit we shine the work of the enemy we ask His blessings in the name of our Lord and Jesus Christ with much Thanksgiving amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen turn around greet somebody welcome them in the house of the Lord amen say good to see you praise the Lord [Music] amen bless the name of Jesus amen so we'll turn to our Bibles in 2 Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 1 amen we're going to continue our message amen a three-dimensional being Faith open charity the essence of Love we'll go into Peter James and John this morning amen a three-dimensional being Faith to open charity which is the essence of love Peter James and John amen so 2 Corinthians 13 and verse1 says in the mouth of two or three Witnesses shall every word be established so if God's going to establish something on the earth he's going to do it in the mouth of two or three Witnesses amen and in 1 Corinthians chap 13:13 praise the Lord it says and now abided faith hope charity these three so these are the three Witnesses we are talking about amen but the greatest of these is Charity amen is love amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so we going to continue we're going to try not to repeat amen things we said last week amen but if the spirit gives utterance we will obey the voice of the spirit this morning so if we get our first quote just to establish what the prophet is saying faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is love now he says faith open charity not three different things but all the essence of one and he says it is love amen hallelujah so I want to remind you why we are speaking these things because this is the image that we we are coming to a three-dimensional man that consists of faith hope and charity amen amen and it is one kept off by Love So within the Capstone of love which is coming over the believer now you are going to find all of these elements you're going to find these three Witnesses amen because this is the perfect man this is the man that's going in the Rapture amen amen I if you're looking for that man going in the Rapture that it's us amen praise the Lord so we know that we are three-dimensional being and we are body which is the flesh the soul the spirit and then the Soul amen I don't if you can say Amen to that you know amen that you're a flesh being amen but you're not controlled by the flesh you walk after the spirit and within your soul lies the gene of God so we are three-dimensional being and we can say it this way that hope is the flesh amen faith is the spirit realm and love is in the soul Realm hallelujah amen in St John 11:21 you'll find there how hope is operating amen praise the Lord you'll see faith in the spirit realm in Romans 8 And1 and you'll see Love is in the soul amen now we know that we were made in the image of God according to Genesis 1: 2627 can you say Amen to that we were made in the image of God but we know that God is love so if God made us in His image then we are love amen yeah our image is also love amen because God's image is his nature his character his essence of his being so if God is love then his bride must be love amen amen with this little quote we're going to see the difference between faith hope and love before we continue amen because we want to establish what the prophet is saying and how he's saying it so that we are not caught unawares we are not caught operating in faith without hope and love or we are not caught operating with a hope amen that is hopeless or we are not caught in faith without love the prophet says that's dangerous let's see what he says now he says now Faith is burning how I like to think of faith hope faith charity those three things hope what a beautiful thing hope is little timid hope lovely and sweet as she is yet she's the greatest enemy faith has right if you remain in Hope only it's an enemy he says the greatest enemy Faith got is Hope cuz a person becomes so hopeful till they leave away from Faith praise the Lord amen now hope will agree with the Bible hope will say it's true hope will say I believe every bit of it so hope believes the word amen hope believes the word of God I believe that's the word of God and I believe that God will keep his promise hope believes all of them that but then op says now believe that God will heal the sick but look at my condition now just to show you that point in the Bible let's go to amen uh John 11 there quickly and 21 I want to show you how op poates let's look at a Bible example amen now watch Jesus is coming and watch how hope speaks then then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou Hast been here my brother had not died Hallelujah now watch she's talking if you had been here now remember what prophet says the devil tries to do he keeps you focused on a Time Gone by or it keep you looking into the future but it fail to show you what God is doing present tense and you see the example right here she's trying to say if you had been here in the past when he was still alive my brother wouldn't have died right so you're seeing this is our hope speaks now next verse but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee let's continue amen Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again amen Mara says now watch he's going to go into future tense now she just spoke about the past she says I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day so hope looks to either the past or it'll look to a future event but never focus on the present but Jesus is going to pull her into a present tense reality yes thank you Lord amen Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live I want you to know this morning if you have a dead circumstance if you have a problem a sickness a disease whatsoever you're going through right now amen Jesus Christ says I am the resurrection and the life amen he can bring your de situation back to life oh yes thank you so Jesus is correcting a teaching and he's bringing hope into Faith so I'm just trying to show you an example of somebody being under Hope but they not expecting to see Faith now because Hebrews 11 says now Faith I like a man who believes and has a now Faith oh yes Lord not looking at tomorrow but e now fa praise the Lord amen I think it's uh 32 if you go to 32 watch when Martha comes along what she says now amen then Mary when she was come where sorry Mary Mara goes to call Mary watch Mary also is in Hope then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if thou H has been here my brother had not died so he can see both Martha and Mary are operating in Hope because their brother is dead wonder I don't care how dead your situation is amen amen don't operate under hope when the present tense word is here now that was Jesus present tense there I'm saying we are the word made flesh now the word present tense is here now so there should be no dead situation there must be a resurrection and there shall be a resurrection let's continue amen that was just the example we wanted to show you in the Bible amen now Faith don't look at that faith comes around I don't care nothing about conditions I don't care about a dead Lazarus in a tomb I don't care about your zero bank balance I don't care about the doctor's report about your sickness or your illness I don't care about your past amen don't care nothing about the conditions God said so and it's mine you see F Burley and I once said faith has hair on the chest so this is not a boy boys don't have hair on the chest this is a man this is a mature son and daughter of God praise the Lord when it stands up and pulls its big muscles out everything else vanishes away am just flies away when Faith really takes a hold nothing else stands see you've got to have hope I'm telling you Faith but you've got to have hope and ch ity now watch what he says if you've got really Bly faith and no love with it you'll ruin your influence before the [Music] people if you haven't got love mixed with it you know sometimes people operate in so low levels of faith that you think they've been so long in the church so long in the message you just want to go there and shake them up a bit but he says now if you do that without love you're going to ruin your influence before the people so everything must be done with love praise the Lord he says You' seen people a really Bly what we would say excuse the expression a bulldog Faith to grab a hold but it's so rough with it then you see when you do that it hasn't got the kindness here to move with it that is why the fivefold ministry must operate together amen the prophet says the Evangelist will come and shake things up the ax will be laid to the root but he says now the shepherd comes and he pours that bomb over it amen he tries to pour that bomb over the wounds amen of the people hallelujah but that's why they've got to work together then you see when you do that it hasn't got any kindness yet to move with it so what we need now watch after saying all of that the prophet is saying this so what we need is Hope Faith charity hope faith charity together pay attention to this now God help our church to have it like that the people to have that combination amen so we need to say as a church now we want to have that combination Even in our own lives we want to have the combination of faith hope and love amen praise the Lord now when Jesus chose 12 disciples there are only three disciples that he changed their name he gave them new names amen you can you can read that in the Bible amen hallelujah uh you find the verses there you can find Amen in many chapters you'll find where Jesus changed Simon to Peter yes hallelujah amen he changes Simon to Peter and then he changes the names of the brothers of James and John and he gives them the surname bonus which means sons of thunder amen hallelujah amen they were the sons of zebede but when Jesus sees them he says you are the sons of thunder this is James and John praise the Lord you find that in mark 317 you'll see there Jesus changes the names of the brothers James and John and he surnames them Bonas which means sons of thunder now watch these three men because they are typing what we are speaking about now you won't find this in the nominal Church World it takes the prophetic eye amen of the scripture to now identify faith hope and charity and give them names amen wonderful so he takes Peter J and John Jesus called these men and you'll notice at significant times in his journey amen through he takes only these three men he takes Peter James and John amen and we know that God doesn't do anything without a purpose he is establishing a thing didn't we say in the beginning there out of two or three Witnesses he will establish it amen l so the prophet is revealing the reason and that's what we're looking at this morning the reason why he chose Peter James and John because this was the Invincible Army Faith open charity is the god man and Jesus knew this and he took them aside when were whenever he was requiring perfect Faith or you was trying to establish something on the earth or it was an important event praise the [Music] Lord Now watch how he says it he says and this is just a little thing on the side but it always appeared to me that Peter represented Faith James hope and John charity hope faith charity what he says God's Earthly witness so if we are saying we Are Witnesses of God we need to possess all three of these Essences amen faith hope and charity now doesn't it seem like hope sounds a bit negative but you've got to have hope my hope is built on nothing less but Jesus blood and righteousness amen Now watch how Jesus so beautifully does it he sandwiches hope in between faith and love to keep it in check whenever it is mentioned in the bible it's mentioned faith hope and charity and when whenever it's mentioned about Peter James and John James is always sandwiched in between those two to keep it in check amen wonderful Hallelujah so we said these are God's Earthly Witnesses and brother brandham also calls it God's Representatives on the earth Faith open charity he says and look at at Peter when he was walking by while he was Mortal he was born of sinful flesh just like you and I that's right but the people had need of a Healer and the people laid in Peter's Shadow and were healed God sent Peter to do a specific work amen he says Hope was in James he was the one to set the church in order Faith was in Peter and charity was in John hope faith and charity it was God's Representatives on the earth amen amen amen remember you're speaking these things because these things must abide and abound in you praise the Lord and then he goes on to say that John was love he says Peter didn't have the love in his heart that John had Hallelujah you're reading this Peter didn't have the love in his heart that John had John was God's agency of love now before we continue further I want you to know that John is a type of the Bride John is a type of an end time people and we are God's agency of love amen amen I I also want to declare that the world can't afford to miss John sir Amen in the agency of Love Comes John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life it is found in the Book of John hallelujah amen so the world can't afford to miss John in this hour or Miss love in this hour or miss the bride in this hour because John is going to go in the Rapture the only Bible the only Grace the only love the only hope that the world will see is through the John ministry that's right is through the bright Ministry on the earth now amen John love is on the earth now amen you and I represent John on the earth now yes we are representing love on the earth now and I tell you this love amen is a super love it's a super anointing come upon the belie Bel amen so God could have chosen Peter which is Faith to be on the aisle of Patmos he could have chosen James which is hope to be on the aisle of Patmos but God chose John to receive the Revelation on the aisle of Patmos hallelujah thank you Lord praise the Lord John we said again he's the type of the Bride so John which is the love Ministry is prophesying again so John is kept with all seven virtues I was expecting a better amen than that this bride is kept with all seven virtues amen she is lacking nothing because the Bible says if we lack anything we will be Barren and unfruitful but this bride can't be in lack in this hour Amen in the midst of grow darkness in the midst of famine God said I will pour out my spirit upon the Earth and when God pours out he pours out in multiplication he pours out in overflow amen this bride is walking with a reserve tank Wednesday we showed you amen amen that this bride has oil in a lamp but she has untapped resources amen amen she's carrying her on full of oil full of untapped resources amen it's an overflowing amen overflowing abundance of the Holy Ghost that's why they couldn't boil John because he was so full of love he was so full of the anointing he was so full of the Holy Ghost they couldn't kill John amen yeah amen praise the Lord You Can't Touch This bride kill this bride amen God has determined that this bride will go into a Rapture amen thank you Lord thank you Lord so I say again no sickness shall take your life if your name is put there to go in the Rapture sickness couldn't take Enoch's life amen sickness couldn't take Elijah's life amen they were predestinated for a specific time and a season thank you Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord amen amen hallelujah the prophet says when we miss love that we miss we just said we can't miss John now he says friends when you miss the love of God in your hearts you miss everything so when they are missing the prophetic voice and the voice that follows the prophet which is the final voice the bride's Ministry they miss everything he says when you miss the love of God in your hearts you miss everything no matter what you've done where there's tongues it'll seize where there's prophecies it'll vanish but where there's charity It Last Forever John lasts forever this bride lasts forever he said that rather my wife would love me then be afraid of me wouldn't you sure you love God the love of God in your heart now isn't it strange there a group of people come to Jesus and Jesus giving this illustration and he says Lord I've cast out demon demons in your name I've prophesied in your name yes sir so what what were they operating with they were they were operating Kingdom principles but they were not the kingdom Jesus said to them depart from me he workers of iniquities I never knew you amen praise the Lord why they were not operating with these Kingdom [Music] principles they may have been operating with faith alone but charity only comes at the end time the Capstone arise and shine for thy light has come he's only coming in Revelation 10 amen praise the Lord hallelujah let's go to Luke 8:51 amen remember now we got to read the Bible because a lot of people don't read their Bibles so at least when you come to church you're reading a good dose of your Bible amen praise the Lord Luke 8:51 and when he came into the house he suffered no now this is now jerus Jus comes to Jesus and he ask Jesus to come to his house by the time they get to the house you know on the way somebody came with a message that your daughter is already dead now let's operate principles if you're calling us to pray at your home and there's unbelievers there and we we tell them to please leave the room please don't get offended or if you called us and you know what time we're coming you should have already cleared the room that's right amen praise the Lord amen yes amen the kingdom of of Heaven has principles it has laws and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save Peter James and John there it is again amen faith hope and charity and the father and the mother of the maiden and all wept and bewailed but he said weep not she is dead she's not dead but sleepeth and they laughed into scor knowing that she was dead and he put them all out so when we speak a word over your life and we say it is finished if there are thoughts coming through your head scorning and laughing cast it out immediately amen even if it's your family member speaking a NE netive word it can't be cast it out immediately tell them immediately if you don't believe it you rather stay quiet but I'm going to hold to God's word amen and he put them all out and he took her by the hand and called saying maid arise and a Spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded to give her meat praise the Lord thank let's just jump to Revelation 10 the bride was dead what you are witnessing in Revelation 10 is the resurrection of the Bride of Jesus Christ after the prophetic gift of Revelation 10:7 the bride comes back to life amen she awakes at the Midnight Cry and that's why he says take the book and eat you've got to eat amen when your strength comes back to the body and the bride is awakened that's why he says what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead amen so in Revelation 10 the bride is awakened can these red bones live again son of man prophesy to these Dry Bones amen hallelujah so the bride was awakened and quickened and when she awakened give her something to eat oh yes praise the Lord thank you Lord the prophet now elaborates on this he says he walked into the house where all that was at he how could he ever do anything when when that kind of unbelief was he said every one of you get out put them out of the house get going every one of you doubt fear anxiety get out he was wondering who had Faith he said Peter James and John oh Faith oh charity come here that's what he has to have you see what happens if you want to see the resurrection of the Dead what is the prophet saying that's what he has to have we kind have people going into a SI room with no hope and they're trying to operate there no open the scriptures no open the word they no have no knowledge of the word and they're trying to operate maybe out of traditional religion they're just praying over situations amen maybe even in the prayer line people walk in and walk out no faith to exercise amen he says that's what he has to have bring them in amen praise the Lord so what do it mean when he say bring them in meaning if you don't have it bring it in if you have faith without love bring in Hope amen if you have faith and love bring in hope if you have amen hope and and love bring in faith amen or if you have Faith and Hope bringing love he says it's got to have this combination amen he walked over there and all on the outside of that wall was unbelief so he was empowered with the spirit so he could speak speak in unknown towns praise the Lord that's the prophet of God now amen in Jus and Divine Healing glory amen amen let's go to Luke chapter 28 928 and it came to pass about in eight days after these Saints he took Peter John and James and went up into a mountain to pray hallelujah amen so notice how prayer should be approached you've got to take faith hope and charity Hallelujah and he prayed the fashion of his and as he prayed the fashion of his count was altered and his reignment was white and glistening and behold so when Glory comes upon you it changes your outer garments even remember when the glory Came Upon Moses and we are saying the glory of the Lord is returning to his church amen amenah so expect to see a change of countenance expect to see a change of reignment Glory and behold they talked with him two men which were Moses and Elias who appeared in glory and spake of his of his decreas which he should accomplish at Jerusalem sorry spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they awake they saw his glory so your faith can go to sleep that's right in the midst of the supernatural your faith can go to sleep right now who else did he take with him James and John the Bible is saying here Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him and it came to pass as they departed from him Peter said unto Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elias not knowing what he said while he thus speak there came a cloud and overshadowed them praise the Lord amen and they feared as they entered into the cloud so people who don't believe this Cloud have not entered into the cloud amen praise the Lord amen yes what is that Jesus adoption ceremony everybody agreed that was Jesus adoption ceremony now if the groom got adopted and had an adoption ceremony and there was a cloud that came down and they entered into the cloud for the bride's adoption ceremony which is in Revelation 10 there's got to be a cloud and there's got to be a people who enter into the cloud amen who enter into that revelation we are swept up into the Revelation what was the cloud seven angels formed that cloud the prophet says night after night an angel came to me in the room and gave me the revelation of that seal yes so when we receive the revelation of the word we are entering the cloud glory and they came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son hear him amen praise the Lord now I want you to remember in Revelation 101 it's saying that they came from Heaven you can put it up there was a mighty Angel who descended from Heaven clothed with a cloud yes amen right a rainbow over his head I want you to know that picture didn't change when John is going to the Angel's hand everybody understand amen he's close clth with a cloud so when John is going to this Angel this Angel is still clothed with a cloud a rainbow about his head everybody understanding the picture amen so I'm trying to show you here that amen what happened to Jesus happens to the bride the bride has got to be adopted let's see what the prophet of God says now and then the son after he's talking about a son under tutors I just want to tell you that he's talking about adoption and then the son after he come out there was given no longer was he just like a servant and tutor he was the boss I I pray we got brothers and sisters here that feel like a boss over the father's Kingdom am I hope the soaks real deep going to leave you in a minute let's get way down deep the sun was no more under tutor can I get a witness of of somebody here of a son who says I'm no longer under tutor amen yes amen come on now there's a son who's no more under a tutor but he was like his father Yes amen and his father give him certain things to do the father might have told him you take care of this field over here and you do this over here you take care of the slaves you take care of whatever it is he was in full possession amen so when the book is added to you it's the father giving you amen a job to do on the earth when he's saying th prophesy again he is doing this to you giving you full possession amen remember now the book is a titled deed of man's Redemption the book has names so who has the book John has the book The Bride has the book so the bride's Ministry to prophesy again is to call those names that are in the book amen thank you Lord praise the Lord yes amen obviously this is not skim me skim milk now amen this is meat for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord now remember what we spoke in on wedes day facing up to the realities of your inheritance when a wool is read the father Can Read certain things to you like this now he can leave you in charge of certain things but if you're a son who is not obedient to the will of the father you will let the father's Factory go to waste you won't manage it properly so you are called to the reading of the will in reev 10 amen and you are put in Authority when he's giving you the book amen yes amen and he's telling you that I must prophesy again now what kind of son and daughter will we be he says he was in full possession for he was adopted into that family and his name on a check was as good as his daddy's now what God has done the reason we see these things and we know there's something wrong friend we see the promises of God we seed in the word but God has just begin to my humble opinion to adopting his son positionally calling him out to one side giving him a certain Ministry anointing them for that purpose sending them out watch what happens when he does now watch where the Prophet goes with this everything that he has given him possession over will take given him possession over will take place God adopted his own son like that amen Jesus walking as an ordinary man but one day upon Mon's Transfiguration he taken three as a witness Peter James John hope faith charity watch how he sandwiches are all thing together called him out and separated Jesus from them and he overshadowed him and the Bible said is Raymond sha like the son in its strength what was it that special robe God adopting his son now he's going to progress that thought now into his church you that's positionally seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus be humble Brethren someday the holy spirit will speak to you amen amen call you out to one side somewhere in a little cabin on a hillside or in the washroom somewhere and they will anoint you for a certain service or certain thing to do amen thank you Lord amen so he's going to personalize your adoption somebody say Amen you are not going to get adopted as a church group God is going to personalize your adoption he said it might be in a cabin a hillside a washroom but somewhere God will anoint you for a certain service amen it won't be laying on the hand of presp or Elders can you see what he's saying the power won't be laying only in the ministry it won't be laying in the hand of the presbyters and Elders it will be laying on the hands of God Almighty himself to put a new ministry in you or somebody say this morning Lord put a new ministry in me amen amen and a new robe on you and to set you out as an example and all the demons out of Torment will never upset you right in fact you upset those demons yes you become a Tormentor to demons demons can't stand your presence oh why have you come to torment [Music] us amen God grant my brethren that we each one receive this blessing amen now I'm doing this very specifically because I want you to see it in the message of the hour I want you to see this is what the prophet taught about faith hope and charity and how it's tied to the adoption ceremony I want you to know that it's tied to Revelation 10 and this bride can't be adopted without faith hope and charity the essence of love and that's where the church has gone now when you got back there and was born again you think that settles it you went off at ease now you're finding yourself with cramps not enough manner backsliding from one meeting to another born again on a Sunday gone again on a Monday he says backsliding from one meeting to another what is it God has watched the conduct of his church I want you to know the Holy Ghost is still watching the conduct of his church amen he's watching our your approach to church he's watching how you come to church he's watching your preparation for the service he's watching how you just rushing here he's watching how your conduct God has watched the conduct of his church he has taken three for your witness now watch he first said amen that three he establishes a word in the mou of two or three Witnesses now he's calling this three Faith open charity a witness the Bible said three is a witness he took Peter James and John love hope charity he means to say faith open charity now the the reason the church is not progressing you skipped about from place to place here and there dling in the world and around this way and fussing about your organization and your denomination whether you this that or the others whether you're Oneness Tess threeness Fess whether you've been baptized fac forward backwards or all kinds of things and fussing and drawing barriers and things that's the reason the church is not going on it's true right amen I see this way I see this way I believe this way I believe that way Same Spirit crept into the message he says if you'd ever break down your walls let this one be this and that one be that whatever you are that doesn't matter but when you can put your hand in your brother's hand and call him brother we're working for one cause that's the kingdom of God hallelujah if you ever get to a place that I couldn't put my arm around my brother that's working for the kingdom of God and recognize him as my brother I feel I'm backslid that's right I'd be scared to stand on the platform and face evil spirits to know that I end in my heart against any brother and how dare we come that way how dare we come to stand on the ppit with with the hot in our hearts doesn't the Bible say if you have ought against your brother leave your gift at the altar amen go and reconcile with your brother first but but the Bible says [Music] fools will go with up nail shoes where even Angels Fear to trou I pray it hasn't been our case that we've come come to face evil spirits knowing that we had Envy in our hearts against our brothers he says no matter who he is that's trying to preach the Gospel of Jesus or live a Christian Life if we disagree a million miles upon theology if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my brother it's my sister and we've draw those lines and if you can't love your brother whom you have seen how can you love God whom you have never seen amen and brother when love goes out God goes with it when John goes off the Earth love goes with it when the bride goes off the Earth love leaves the [Music] Earth God goes with it for God is love and you can never get anywhere without Divine love as you love one another you love God Amen Prophet is progressing his thought now he's showing you how God fixes the drama and there's a reason why we are showing you this now he's showing you and he's saying when he was foreshadowing Jes Jesus the first time there he did a specific work right he says and on the road up as God was fixing to set a drama he taken three Witnesses Peter James and John now I just love to look at this in this respect as Peter representing Faith James representing hope John love charity hope faith those three great Witnesses and in Earth there's three great w three Witnesses faith Hope Charity the Bible teaches that he brought forth faith hope charity to give witness of what he was just fixing to do remember I'm driving a point here now the reason why we must establish Faith open love God is showing his fixing to do something amen that's right now I know many Bible teachers here tonight are saying what's he going at where's the prophet going with this I know the correct picture of this Brethren foreshadowing the coming of Jesus amen so foreshadowing the coming of Jesus faith hope and charity will be the Church of God yes amen but tonight I wish to take it a little different sphere he says every subject in the Bible everything in the Bible ties together in every word in the Bible the entire Bible every word ties to ties into Jesus Christ amen every type every shadow everything ties in so this Faith open charity he's trying to show it ties in greet your brother and sister say God bless you says now now is not the time to sleep we are on the home stretch now amen we on the home stretch now amen some of you feeling like Peter James and John they up on the mountain you're going [Music] to Peter James and John they love to sleep these three we just showed you in the Bible Jesus took them up on the mountain before he was transfigured they they were out you'll see again now in the Garden of Gethsemane they were out so Peter James and John needs to be kept awake amen amen praise the Lord what is the prophet saying everything ties together it's foreshadowing the coming amen right he says if you can the next quote now if you can have faith and hope and love you're near the Kingdom of Heaven am the three great things God taken those as a confirmation because in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established then again it represented the placing of his son amen Faith open charity represents the placing of his son amen praise the Lord so the next quote in spiritual adoption he says under the witness of adoption under the witness of Faith under the witness of love God placed his son positionally in the public of all three great manifestations so now he's calling it a manifestation everybody following amen amen talking about still now about his adoption God Gathering three people and three is a confirmation or a witness in the word of God Amen I want to remind you don't take faith alone don't take hope alone don't take love alone you got to be this threedimensional being yes if you want to go in the Rapture if you want to be adopted praise the Lord amen in the message there in the paragraph 13 He says John was once different you know he was the one who wanted to call down fire from heaven destroy the city because you wouldn't give him something to eat down there so Myster to him and he wanted to burn the whole thing up and then after Jesus got all of him he changed him into a man of love thank you Lord he says those three elements the sufficient element to work out every problem the church has amen now watch where we've progressed with this it's no longer just words Faith open charity he's calling it a manifestation he's calling it God's confirmation he's calling it God's placing of the church and now he's saying those three elements the sufficient elements to work out every problem the church has amen amen you let faith open charity getting among the people in a church watch what takes place amen so he manifested his son before all three these great elements hope faith charity now I want you to notice on under the cloud was three others Moses Elijah and Jesus three is a confirmation confirms anything praise the Lord in the message am amen the that the next quot we're going to skip that one go to the next one he says the three greatest witness we have in the Christian Realms anyhow it says in the next one we find when they got on the mountain these three gifts hope faith and charity almost cover the the whole sphere of gifts charity being the greatest love amen thank you Lord amen the next one he says and that is also wrapped in every Ministry that comes from God faith hope charity faith to perform his word hope for the people and love for all praise the Lord Mark 14:33 as we close now we might close a bit earlier because I know you feeling very hot praise the Lord Mark 14:33 and he taketh with him Peter James and John and began to be so amazed and to be very heavy and he said unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death T here and watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and he prayed if it were possible the hour might pass from him and he said our father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will but what thou Wilt amen and he cometh and finded them sleeping and he said unto Peter Simon sleepest thou could not thou watch one hour Watch and Pray lest you enter into temptation the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words and when he returned he found him asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither wish they what to answer him second time they didn't even know what to answer Jesus they were just sheepishly sleeping there and he came the third time and said unto them sleep on now take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of Sinners amen so in his most tender hour in his Mo the most emotional event of the last week of jesus' life when the weight of the world's sin was upon his shoulder and feeling the horror of the cross he's drawing strength from the father and he's asking Faith open charity to watch with him am so as the church and the body of Jesus Christ we tried to show you how Jesus in the most important points of his journey and his ministry he took Peter James and John we showed you I I'm recapping now we showed you that your adoption ceremony now and we about to be Amen to have the final part of adoption which is the changing of the body am those three elements must exist faith hope and charity love we know is a superpower love is the greatest Force love is the greatest most powerful weapon and Love Has Come John's year now and John is casting out all fear Hallelujah love perfect love cast out all fear so John is on the earth now casting out all fear all anxiety amen hallelujah you can't be striking fear into the hearts of people if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you ought to be casting out all fear yes because you come you become the essence of love so remember now from Faith to love sandwich in between all the virtues praise the Lord and that's the man going in the Rapture so I'm asking you you to approach amen the things that we do for the kingdom of God with Peter James and John with faith hope and charity because that is the secret what we've been unlocking to you now is the secret how to operate in the kingdom of God you'll see jra's daughter resurrected you'll see the supernatural in your Mount Transfiguration and you'll also see at you're going away that was Jes Jesus going away the cross at the bride's going away will be faith hope and charity hallelujah thank you Lord amen amen

hope and charity for the bride's adoption ceremony you've got to take faith hope and charity Hallelujah it is showing the manifestation it is a confirmation it is a witness if you want to see the
