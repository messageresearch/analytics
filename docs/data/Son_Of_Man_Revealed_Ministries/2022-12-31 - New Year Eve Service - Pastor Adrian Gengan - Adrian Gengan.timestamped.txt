[17:47] [Music]
[17:54] but we find a spiritual world
[17:58] principality in high places and darkness
[18:02] amen
[18:03] but this is
[18:06] [Music]

[18:39] I did it myself away

[19:18] [Music]
[19:19] foreign
[19:28] [Music]
[19:41] [Music]
[19:51] amen ritual in the precious name of our
[19:54] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[19:56] amen we are totally surrendered to the
[19:59] Lord Jesus Christ we've given ourselves
[20:01] away
[20:01] [Music]
[20:03] therefore we do not find ourselves
[20:05] in a worldly celebration to us this is
[20:09] means more than anything else to Worship
[20:11] the Lord our God
[20:12] amen hallelujah amen so I'd like to
[20:16] greet every one of you in the precious
[20:17] name
[20:18] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[20:21] amen we'll turn to our scripture this
[20:23] morning or this evening
[20:32] Hallelujah
[20:34] let's turn to Revelation 21 and verse 5.
[20:40] we'll speak a little New Year's Eve
[20:42] message
[20:43] amen
[20:47] God likes to do new things
[20:50] amen
[20:52] the world wants to continue in the same
[20:54] old traditions but God surprises them by
[20:58] doing new things
[20:59] amen so Revelation 21 verse 5 says
[21:03] and he that sat upon the throne said
[21:06] behold I make all things new
[21:11] amen
[21:13] if we go into Isaiah 43 and verse 19
[21:21] God is going to do new things
[21:24] but the new things are not
[21:28] for no reason it's for a specific people
[21:32] so Isaiah 43 and verse 19 says behold I
[21:36] will do a new thing
[21:38] now it shall spring forth
[21:41] shall you not know it
[21:43] I will even make a way in the wilderness
[21:47] yes
[21:49] you know you get lost in wilderness
[21:51] but God is saying I'm Gonna Make A Way
[21:53] in the wilderness
[21:55] and rivers in the desert that's unheard
[21:58] of
[22:01] the Beast of the field shall honor me
[22:04] and the dragons and the owls
[22:06] because I have given Waters in the
[22:08] wilderness
[22:09] and rivers in the desert why is he doing
[22:11] this here's the reason to give drink to
[22:14] my people My Chosen
[22:17] these people have I formed for myself
[22:23] eight billion people on the Earth
[22:25] but this people I have formed for myself
[22:31] they shall show forth my praise amen you
[22:35] may be seated may the Lord of blessings
[22:36] to the reading of his word
[22:39] amen
[22:40] amen good to see everyone in the house
[22:42] of the Lord amen everybody feeling good
[22:46] amen amen amen so
[22:49] we find ourselves amen at the end of
[22:51] another here
[22:53] amen for some it may have been good some
[22:57] it may have been bad
[22:58] some God is well pleased with us some
[23:01] God is highly disappointed with us
[23:05] some have given our best excuses to the
[23:08] Lord in the past year why we couldn't
[23:09] serve him
[23:11] some have gotten closer to the Lord
[23:14] we can use this time as a time of
[23:16] reflection to say Lord however I've been
[23:19] serving you
[23:21] have I gotten more closer to you about
[23:24] backslidden
[23:26] we can gauge that right
[23:29] have I gotten closer to the Lord or have
[23:31] I backslidden
[23:33] am I walking out to my own ways why am I
[23:36] saying Lord I'm following up to your
[23:38] ways so we drawing closer to thee
[23:41] end of another cycle of the Earth's
[23:44] revolution around the Sun and it's about
[23:47] to start another
[23:48] you all know he takes the earth 365 days
[23:51] five hours 59 minutes and 16 seconds
[23:55] which is a one year to revolve around
[23:59] the Sun
[24:02] amen so we find even our modern calendar
[24:07] that we use today reminds us that it has
[24:10] been
[24:11] 2023 years since our Lord Jesus Christ
[24:14] was born into this world to redeem and
[24:17] save Mankind from their sin
[24:19] it serves as a reminder
[24:22] we're going into 2023 what does that
[24:25] first tell us our lord Jesus came
[24:28] two thousand years ago
[24:31] now people think that God doesn't work
[24:34] by times or by season
[24:35] but God does
[24:39] he said he set up the Sun and the Moon
[24:42] God has got a specific time and a season
[24:45] he knows exactly when he's coming
[24:50] he knew the first time of his first
[24:52] coming
[24:53] he knows the time of his second coming
[24:55] and Jesus said no man know it
[24:59] no man knoweth he says but the father
[25:01] knoweth
[25:02] the father knoweth all things
[25:06] so who knows
[25:08] if this be the year
[25:11] where the Lord will close up
[25:13] a dispensation
[25:16] we don't know
[25:18] amen we must take note that it is
[25:21] another year closer
[25:22] to the end of the period that the Holy
[25:24] Ghost has been working amongst the
[25:26] Gentiles
[25:29] he's been working since the day of
[25:31] Pentecost
[25:33] but it's it's about time now
[25:36] when the Holy Ghost dispensation amongst
[25:39] the Gentiles will be finished
[25:42] amen
[25:43] and I wonder if
[25:45] that we're coming to the end of the
[25:47] dispensation and some have not got the
[25:50] inheritance
[25:55] amen
[25:56] so
[25:58] we'll send our thoughts or some things
[26:00] on those things because we're going to
[26:01] look at Joshua and Joshua is a type of
[26:05] parallels Ephesians
[26:07] and we know Joshua is trying to place
[26:09] them in a physical land
[26:12] and yes spiritually we are trying to be
[26:14] placed in a land right amen so
[26:18] so I'd like to greet every one of you
[26:20] once again
[26:21] I trusted everybody as well before I
[26:23] want to get started amen I just want to
[26:25] invite uh brother Joshua and brother
[26:27] Sunny to greet the church for five
[26:29] minutes each
[26:30] I'm sure they got something to encourage
[26:32] you
[26:33] amen I don't know why sister Elaine is
[26:36] smiling
[26:37] she thinks that's impossible but With
[26:39] God all things are possible
[26:42] amen
[26:44] amen so With God all things are possible
[26:48] so amen I appreciate the ministry
[26:51] appreciate the brothers that stand by
[26:53] appreciate amen the song leaders amen
[26:55] thank you brother Jacobs for leading the
[26:57] songs
[26:59] but amen they are the ones that fool
[27:04] around the coming of the minister
[27:06] and if they don't set the right
[27:09] atmosphere it's harder for the minister
[27:12] to preach to the people
[27:13] so even the song leading is a gift
[27:17] amen they carry an anointing
[27:20] even the musicians amen
[27:23] I'd like to say thank you for your
[27:25] service to the Lord
[27:27] I know my words and my thanks may not
[27:30] mean much because you are really
[27:31] offering it to the Lord
[27:33] but as the past of the church I want to
[27:35] extend my appreciation to you
[27:37] amen even the other helps for the Jaden
[27:40] amen all the other brothers that help
[27:42] out in the church amen whatever offers
[27:45] you hold in the church like to thank
[27:47] Brother Sam to the Tyler was always here
[27:49] at the church and try to cleaning up and
[27:51] doing the stuff behind the scenes things
[27:53] that we don't see amen but the same is
[27:57] always concerned
[27:58] you know checking up on things checking
[28:01] up if I've got water checking up on all
[28:03] these small things
[28:04] those are Ministries those are gifts
[28:07] amen those are helps to the church
[28:09] and we appreciate every one of them then
[28:11] we don't want to forget our singers amen
[28:13] whatever amen they're trying to do
[28:17] something for the Lord and they're
[28:18] trying to give their best to the Lord
[28:20] but I believe we can step it up
[28:24] we can go higher
[28:27] amen we can Excel but like David would
[28:30] would tell the people play skillfully
[28:32] before the Lord
[28:34] amen sing joyfully sing wonderfully amen
[28:39] We Can Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord
[28:41] so amen we don't want to waste too much
[28:43] of time
[28:44] uh don't call Brother Joshua first amen
[28:48] and then we'll call Brother the son amen
[28:50] yes
[28:58] amen I greet you all in the wonderful
[29:00] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[29:01] and that we thank the Lord for it
[29:04] seeing as food is here amen and I think
[29:08] you heard me make mention of the one
[29:11] statement earlier this year that when we
[29:13] first came in the message and we looked
[29:15] at the amount of messages that were
[29:18] there and we thought when what happened
[29:20] when we come to the end of that message
[29:22] only to find out when you receive the
[29:24] Holy Ghost you realize that under the
[29:26] leadership of the holy spirit that this
[29:27] is an inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[29:30] Hallelujah and as we've seen the
[29:33] progression in the world we know there's
[29:35] been a transition in the ministry and we
[29:37] appreciate how the Lord has seen us
[29:39] through amen and we've seen
[29:42] the progression in the world because
[29:44] it's reaching a climax now and we're
[29:47] coming to the close to the end of the
[29:49] Gentile dispensation
[29:51] and as the prophet said as it gets
[29:53] closer all these things will be revealed
[29:55] Hallelujah so all these Mysteries have
[29:57] been made more clearer to us
[29:59] and how is it Behavior God gives always
[30:03] find the amazing man God has placed the
[30:05] FireFold Ministry they play certain
[30:07] opposite His Place Ministries
[30:10] and God's uses vessels that he has
[30:15] chosen before the foundations of the
[30:17] Earth
[30:17] they're very aware that the prophet has
[30:19] spoken this very word that was stored up
[30:22] for jewishism is now using his gifts to
[30:26] bring it out and make it clear to you to
[30:28] make it make you to understand it in the
[30:30] day that you are living it so as you're
[30:33] seeing the world being preached it makes
[30:35] it makes sense in the day that you are
[30:37] living
[30:38] and you began to want you began to
[30:41] understand your part and Play Your Part
[30:43] in academics and realize your heart in
[30:46] the mystery amen so it's no longer a
[30:48] mystery when you are playing your part
[30:49] amen now it's a manifestation yes of
[30:53] that word amen and that's where we are
[30:55] right now and as we sing ourselves
[30:57] approaching the new year we know that we
[31:00] we have learned we don't turn you leave
[31:03] but we want to get ourselves more
[31:04] consecrated to God yes we don't know
[31:06] what the new rules but we know as long
[31:09] as he's holding us in his hands yes and
[31:11] as long as we stay
[31:12] fortified under his word then we know
[31:15] that we are in safety ground amen so I
[31:19] greet you all in the lovely name of
[31:20] Jesus Christ we thank God for each one
[31:22] of you for every family I believe
[31:23] there's a progression in each home amen
[31:26] and that's what we want we don't want a
[31:29] progression just in the church we want a
[31:31] progression to every believer because
[31:33] each one of us make the body of Christ
[31:35] amen every one of us that they put to
[31:38] play and every one of us make the body
[31:41] of Christ make up the body of Christ to
[31:43] continue to pray for the ministry pray
[31:45] for our pastor that God will give him
[31:46] more revelation of the world and then we
[31:49] can be fulfilled with that amen God is
[31:52] placed the gift here we need to respect
[31:54] the gift and appreciate the gift is
[31:56] given us and also the faithful Ministry
[31:58] that will come that will come and preach
[31:59] it come and preach to us from time to
[32:01] time we must appreciate the gifts that
[32:03] God sends us and pull from the gift and
[32:06] God will take us as we're going along
[32:08] the spiritual journey now we believe
[32:10] that there's much land to possess amen
[32:14] don't let the uncircumcised go and claim
[32:18] things just by saying things and
[32:20] claiming things this all these things
[32:23] belong to us amen this entire Earth now
[32:27] it's a scientific civilization yes but
[32:29] this Earth is going to be renovated It
[32:30] All Belongs to us
[32:32] we have rightful claims over it amen but
[32:35] it's not a foot darling phrase right now
[32:36] but God is going to make it a good
[32:39] wedding place just like are you dealing
[32:41] with man through Redemption
[32:43] justification by water blood and the
[32:46] whole baptism of the Holy Ghost just
[32:48] like that he's been dealing with the
[32:49] Earth through water so Noah from the
[32:52] days of Noah the blood of Jesus upon the
[32:55] Earth and now we know what's going to
[32:56] happen upon the Earth with fire amen
[32:58] this world will be renovated amen and
[33:01] become a foot Dwelling Place amen God
[33:03] needs to bless you as you enter the New
[33:04] Year our desire is to have a closer walk
[33:07] with him to be more consecrated and more
[33:10] closer to him yes and because what we
[33:11] want is for him to reveal more of his
[33:14] word to us amen amen God bless you
[33:19] thank you
[33:26] hmm
[33:37] praise the Lord amen praise the Lord
[33:40] hallelujah glory to God getting old
[33:46] theater starting to
[33:48] hold back
[33:51] he's still
[33:53] Grace amen
[33:57] creature in the lovely name of Jesus
[33:59] Christ
[34:00] evening
[34:03] sometime I would like to say I'm happy
[34:06] but sometimes we can be disappointed
[34:09] this place should be full tonight
[34:14] but when we look around
[34:16] people chose to still stay at home
[34:21] people chose to stay at home and rather
[34:24] be in the presence of the Lord
[34:26] but then during the course of the year
[34:29] you want to call to the eldest and call
[34:32] to the church you want to call a
[34:34] preacher
[34:35] because you're having problems
[34:38] problems can never be solved at all
[34:41] the only place it can be solved in the
[34:44] house of God Amen because God is
[34:46] anointing people
[34:48] God is Anointed his servants
[34:51] to come
[34:52] and do that work amen you cannot stay
[34:55] here and stay at home and do it
[34:58] you know we're going into the New Year
[35:00] we're not fighting against flesh and
[35:03] blood yes
[35:04] invading against principalities
[35:06] wickedness and high places
[35:09] the prophet said 200 000 demons are
[35:12] released on the face of the Earth
[35:16] and we are not
[35:18] safe anyway
[35:20] unless we allow ourselves
[35:23] to have a head built around us yes
[35:27] and that only thing can be done is by
[35:30] God God is Grace when you sufficiently
[35:36] just now he said spoke about excuses
[35:40] you know excuses are something that is
[35:43] very very dangerous
[35:45] very dangerous
[35:47] see the Bible you see everything that if
[35:49] an answer you require an answer you will
[35:52] get it in the Bible
[35:54] nothing that you cannot get if you're
[35:58] looking for something
[36:00] everything if you're looking for love
[36:01] you'll get it in the Bible
[36:03] if you're looking for hate you'll get it
[36:05] in the Bible if you're looking for a
[36:06] fight you'll get it in the Bible
[36:09] excuses are very dangerous
[36:12] if he did not forgave a parable about
[36:14] those men that were invited to the
[36:17] Sabbath
[36:18] he said
[36:20] they were invited for supper
[36:22] but when they went to call them
[36:24] what happened one said I married a wife
[36:27] I need to have some time so today some
[36:31] people have married their wife and they
[36:32] had some time at home
[36:36] then the other one he said he bought 10
[36:38] euros of milk oxen and you need to go
[36:41] and check it out first time in my life I
[36:43] want to see somebody doing business and
[36:45] doing it in the night yeah doing that on
[36:48] now and check the option for plowing the
[36:49] night oh he's gonna plow in the late
[36:51] night time no you can't do that then I
[36:55] got a guy bought a land he didn't want
[36:57] to go chicken up in the night
[36:59] you see now when you make excuses
[37:02] they don't sound right
[37:05] then you will find another excuse for
[37:07] that excuse
[37:08] and then you will continue and it will
[37:10] be a lie and one lie about another level
[37:14] I don't want to start preaching tonight
[37:16] because
[37:17] we have somebody that the Lord has
[37:19] chosen to preach
[37:20] but this is how we like to end our this
[37:24] is this is a year that has gone through
[37:26] we are going through some hard times we
[37:28] have gone through the Peaks and The
[37:29] Valleys in our rights we have gone
[37:31] through the storms we've gone through
[37:34] the winds
[37:36] and you know the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus
[37:38] is the one that can calm the storms amen
[37:43] he made us like eagles so we can Fly
[37:46] Above the storms
[37:48] so there is no storm that can come for
[37:50] you
[37:51] and if you've got the Hedge around you
[37:53] tell them to you nothing
[37:56] he's the captain of our ship
[37:59] he can take us through those waves
[38:02] through the tsunamis in our lives we
[38:05] have many of them
[38:07] I want to remind you the next year is
[38:09] not going to be a easy year for us
[38:11] if you don't have the Lord
[38:13] it's not going to be easy
[38:16] it's going to be very very difficult
[38:18] because if you look around us the
[38:21] scriptures have been fulfilled
[38:22] every moment in time if you look from
[38:24] scriptures are being fulfilled
[38:27] you never hear of Rivers Drive
[38:30] you will never hear of floods like this
[38:32] and the rivers are drying in spite of
[38:34] the flags
[38:36] so you can see
[38:38] these demons are alive and they're
[38:41] making havoc on Earth
[38:45] so tonight as we move on to the new year
[38:49] let us let us hear tonight
[38:54] make
[38:55] a covenant to God
[38:58] we will pray for the backsliders
[39:01] we will pray for the backsliders so they
[39:04] will tell back to the cold time is
[39:06] attacked we haven't got much time yeah
[39:08] 50 years ago the prophet said he was
[39:10] coming 50 years down the line we still
[39:13] see people are still dirty lazy it is
[39:16] time that we now wake up it is time that
[39:18] we realize time is short time is a Time
[39:22] he says when you see these things begin
[39:24] to happen he said lift up your head for
[39:26] your Redemption throughout night
[39:30] and if our Redemption is coming near
[39:33] what we are waiting for amen we are
[39:37] waiting for our body change amen
[39:40] he said eyes have not the lies have not
[39:42] seen years have not been neither it is
[39:44] entered into the heart of man what God
[39:46] is prepared for us and you can still be

[40:14] right

[40:17] living

[40:21] us amen the new years we can go to it

[40:28] that he is going to come
[40:31] and to receive us and then be going over
[40:34] to the other side I pray tonight
[40:36] that we will turn around from all those
[40:40] Wasted Years
[40:42] we have wasted many years I regret the
[40:44] days that beauties
[40:46] but we are wasted many years let us turn
[40:48] around
[40:49] and look to God Amen I also want to
[40:52] thank the church tonight

[41:11] has brought me through I feel stronger
[41:13] but he did

[41:20] bad times

[41:27] little bit more time amen and maybe I

[42:17] the Deacon of the church he's been doing
[42:19] a tremendous job at that amen so we're
[42:21] just going to ask him to come forward
[42:22] and greet the church as well and I'm
[42:25] sure he's not going to keep uh he
[42:27] probably will under use his five minutes
[42:29] but brother submission we want to

[43:03] [Music]
[43:06] and I believe that like a brother said
[43:09] we need to pray for our families
[43:11] they're very stepped away
[43:14] and those are excellent
[43:16] so that they may come back into the
[43:18] fourth
[43:20] yeah
[43:25] especially my Allah
[43:29] already for me but
[43:32] I believe the praise of the sins
[43:37] amen
[43:47] believe she was gonna come but he prayed
[43:49] the Lord will touch her amen so we move
[43:53] along into our service and uh
[43:55] amen after the preaching of the word
[43:58] will observe communion and feed washing
[44:02] Hallelujah these are the ordinances
[44:04] given to the church
[44:06] amen everybody feeling good
[44:08] amen turn to your neighbor and say God
[44:10] bless you amen if they are sleeping tell
[44:13] them wake up
[44:15] I know many of us around this time we're
[44:17] already in bed
[44:19] so today is an unusual day amen amen
[44:23] amen but if we were at home or something
[44:26] else and there was no church I don't
[44:28] know what we'll be doing I remember that
[44:29] one year during the lockdown we were
[44:31] like completely lost we didn't know what
[44:32] to do amen but we thank the Lord that we
[44:37] can be found in the presence of the Lord
[44:39] this evening amen so
[44:41] let's start out in Joshua chapter 1
[44:44] verse 6 and here the Lord
[44:46] is commissioning Joshua
[44:48] so I want you to follow the sequence of
[44:50] events hear the Lord is speaking to
[44:52] Joshua the new leader
[44:55] remember our focus is something new
[44:58] behold I will do new things
[45:00] we're entering a new year
[45:02] amen
[45:04] so God is now speaking to the new leader
[45:09] and in 1 6 he tells him be strong and
[45:13] have a good courage
[45:16] amen
[45:18] For unto this people
[45:21] shall not divide for an inheritance the
[45:23] land
[45:25] that every one of us has to have a
[45:27] portion of the Holy Ghost
[45:32] Joshua is here to divide the land
[45:35] and bring you into your inheritance
[45:39] he says unto those people shall that
[45:42] divide for inheritance the land which I
[45:44] swear unto their fathers to give them
[45:47] so God is bound by his word
[45:50] what he promised Abraham so long ago
[45:54] he is still making sure his word is
[45:56] coming to pass
[45:58] situations may have changed
[46:01] Seasons may have changed man may have
[46:04] changed but God still remained true to
[46:07] his word
[46:10] amen
[46:13] he says only be thou strong and very
[46:16] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[46:19] do according to all the law which Moses
[46:22] my servant commanded thee turn not from
[46:25] it to the right hand or to the left that
[46:28] thou mayest Prosper with us however thou
[46:31] goest
[46:33] but actually I'm going to tell you your
[46:34] natural blessings are tied to your
[46:37] spiritual relationship with the Lord
[46:40] here's the Lord laying it out to Joshua
[46:44] you keep the law
[46:46] You observe the message and everything
[46:48] the prophet laid out in the message and
[46:51] you shall be prosperous
[46:56] he says this book of the law shall not
[46:59] depart out of thy mouth
[47:04] oh did you get it
[47:08] the book mustn't be in your hand
[47:11] the book mustn't be on the Shelf
[47:15] if the book is on your mouth it means
[47:17] you must be speaking about it
[47:21] [Music]
[47:23] let me say these people have formed for
[47:25] myself that they may show forth my
[47:27] praise what is praise being able to
[47:29] speak
[47:32] he's saying the book of the Lord shall
[47:34] not depart out of their mouth
[47:36] you can't get them to shut up
[47:39] amen they got a word they're going to
[47:40] speak but Thou shalt meditate day in day
[47:44] and night that thou man is to observe to
[47:46] do according to all that is written
[47:49] therein then thou shall make thy way
[47:52] prosperous
[47:56] have you heard some of the advice being
[47:58] given I am giving you advice how to
[48:00] approach the New Year this evening
[48:04] approach it with observing what the
[48:07] Bible says
[48:09] change your life around
[48:11] [Music]
[48:12] amen don't follow your own understanding
[48:15] in the way you want to do things right
[48:17] you say but I'm successful let's read
[48:19] and then thou shall have good success
[48:23] but all success is not good success
[48:27] there is good success and there is bad
[48:29] success
[48:34] you say what about the way of the
[48:36] ungodly and The Sinner
[48:38] and the successful what about the one
[48:41] who serves other gods
[48:43] they are successful and they achieve
[48:45] they have good jobs their wealth
[48:48] it depends what you determine and what
[48:51] you call successful
[48:55] early achievements worldly
[48:57] accomplishments and education is not
[49:00] something to be impressed or to be post
[49:02] about
[49:03] those are means to an end
[49:08] one of the most successful young men
[49:12] recorded in the Bible
[49:14] most successful
[49:15] you couldn't find the most successful
[49:17] man than this
[49:20] he was young and he was successful the
[49:22] Bible calls him the Rich Young Ruler
[49:25] testified to this when he came to the
[49:28] end of his successful achievements he
[49:31] came to the most successful man
[49:37] he didn't go to the rabbis
[49:40] he was searching for something
[49:43] and you know when you are successful you
[49:46] don't want to go and speak to somebody
[49:48] who is less successful than you
[49:54] so he comes to the greatest to the
[49:57] Fountain of all success our Lord Jesus
[50:00] Christ and he asked Jesus what good
[50:02] thing can I do that I may have eternal
[50:05] life
[50:08] amen he and you were successfully
[50:12] we are driving your point here now
[50:15] the same Lord Jesus
[50:17] who told him to sell all you have give
[50:19] it to the poor take up your cross and
[50:21] come and follow me
[50:24] Christ is still calling you to follow
[50:26] him
[50:28] are you willing to follow him
[50:30] amen some have followed Jesus but along
[50:34] the way a Day's Journey or two days
[50:36] journey when Jesus turned to look back
[50:38] you're not there
[50:40] you've gone and doing your own things
[50:43] but follow Jesus
[50:47] amen the same Jesus in Matthew 6 33
[50:50] gives us the key to the kingdom of God
[50:53] the key to success he says seek him
[50:56] first the kingdom of God
[50:59] this is the same one speaking to Joshua
[51:02] telling him observe the Commandments of
[51:04] God Amen now he's in human flesh and he
[51:08] is telling you seek ye first the kingdom
[51:10] of God
[51:11] some of you are the same man right now
[51:13] amen amen I don't know what you are
[51:16] thinking about right now but you get
[51:18] involved in the service you involve
[51:20] yourself in this spiritual atmosphere
[51:22] amen
[51:24] hallelujah
[51:25] amen I don't care if you're a male I
[51:29] don't care if you're a female I don't

[51:32] you're old you are to open up your mouth
[51:34] and amen the word of God Amen

[52:18] is weak the spirit man within you is
[52:21] willing but the flesh is weak amen
[52:24] amen hallelujah he says then all these
[52:28] things shall be added unto you
[52:31] he will add it
[52:34] God will add it to you
[52:37] good success comes from having a
[52:40] personal relationship with the Lord
[52:41] Jesus Christ we are defining good
[52:43] success
[52:45] being born again of water and of spirit
[52:48] it comes with having a new birth having
[52:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:54] amen that's the definition of true
[52:57] success he that believeth on him shall
[53:00] not perish but have everlasting life
[53:04] a periods of people are living many
[53:06] meaningless lives
[53:10] billions of people are wasting the time
[53:12] on the Earth
[53:14] because they are living without the Holy
[53:16] Ghost
[53:19] they will live out their time on Earth
[53:22] and go to the Grave with no promise of a
[53:25] resurrection
[53:29] it's ruthless meaningless lives
[53:36] but there is a group of people
[53:38] that have a promise of an inheritance

[54:45] expect better results
[54:48] one day what is what they say is the
[54:50] definition of insanity

[54:58] amen amen
[55:00] Hallelujah now we have the promise of an
[55:03] inheritance let's let's pick up uh

[55:12] heard the word of Truth
[55:13] the gospel of your salvation you know
[55:16] also after you believed you were sealed
[55:19] with that Holy Ghost of promise
[55:22] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[55:26] until the day of redemption of the
[55:28] purchased position
[55:30] amen
[55:31] we are almost there now
[55:33] we're almost at the end
[55:36] amen wake up

[55:55] finish the race strong
[55:59] amen
[56:00] oh Hallelujah
[56:03] it says amen
[56:05] this kind of people who have the promise
[56:07] of an inheritance in fact we cannot live
[56:09] without the Holy Ghost anointing
[56:12] amen we are so determined that we would
[56:15] rather die than live a day without the
[56:17] Holy Ghost anointing
[56:18] we would rather die than live live
[56:21] without being led by the angel of God
[56:23] Amen amen can I get some people who will
[56:25] back me up with that statement amen
[56:28] we refuse to go forward without the
[56:31] leadership of the holy spirit amen we
[56:33] refuse to go forward when man made ideas
[56:36] and creeds
[56:37] amen
[56:39] God is raising up a generation that will
[56:41] keep the message pure
[56:43] that will preaches in its entirety
[56:46] amen whether it make sense to us or not
[56:49] we will preach it amen and stay with
[56:52] what the prophet said
[56:55] thank you

[57:00] song I can't
[57:02] even walk
[57:04] without you holding my hand amen
[57:09] we cannot live
[57:11] without the Holy Ghost in fact Ephesians
[57:14] paralyze Joshua and Joshua is the type
[57:17] of the end time leader trying to empower
[57:19] the people and place them in the land of
[57:21] the inheritance
[57:23] and in the spiritual land I find
[57:25] evidence the Holy Ghost
[57:27] amen
[57:30] is our inheritance and the end time
[57:32] leader through the prophet and the
[57:34] fivefold he's trying to place us and
[57:36] position Us in the Holy Ghost
[57:40] now everyone must be placed in the Holy
[57:43] Ghost
[57:45] I want to go from down here and ask
[57:46] every one of you
[57:48] do you have the Holy Ghost
[57:50] most important question you will ever be
[57:52] asked in all your life
[57:55] because if you do not have the Holy
[57:57] Ghost there is no Rapture for you
[58:00] there's no Resurrection for you
[58:08] I want you to live your best life in
[58:11] 2023
[58:12] but there's a way of good success of
[58:14] living it

[58:19] because gross Darkness will always be
[58:21] there
[58:22] right it's Bible prophecy but I'm
[58:24] talking about where the light is shining
[58:26] because I Rise and Shine amen so my life

[58:53] secret right now
[58:55] before be filled be baptized with the

[59:19] let's follow this Joshua 1 15.
[59:25] Joshua now the Lord finished speak to
[59:28] Joshua now Joshua is speaking to the
[59:30] people and instructing the people
[59:34] and listen to what Joshua tells him
[59:37] he says until the Lord had given your
[59:40] brother's rest
[59:43] as he has given you
[59:47] and they also possess the land which the
[59:49] Lord your God giveth them
[59:52] then shall you return unto the land of
[59:55] your possession
[59:57] and enjoy it
[1:00:01] if it went over your head I'm going to
[1:00:03] break it down for you
[1:00:04] Joshua is telling the people
[1:00:07] some of them need help
[1:00:09] right to get to the land of the
[1:00:12] inheritance
[1:00:14] and you don't go to your inheritance
[1:00:17] don't settle down in your land
[1:00:19] until they have settled down in their
[1:00:22] land amen amen until you position them
[1:00:27] if that isn't a type of the faithful
[1:00:29] Ministries laboring amen
[1:00:31] Amen to position the people amen

[1:00:48] return to the land of your inheritance
[1:00:50] after they are settled and enjoy it
[1:00:56] now for those of you who are too
[1:00:58] spiritual who think that we should not
[1:01:00] enjoy things in this life
[1:01:03] what is the old Book of Joshua all about
[1:01:07] placing them in a physical land
[1:01:09] to enjoy the physical blessings of the
[1:01:12] land
[1:01:13] as long as you are still here on the
[1:01:15] Earth
[1:01:17] this is your home
[1:01:20] and God will bless you here on the Earth
[1:01:23] amen
[1:01:27] now let's turn to Joshua 14.
[1:01:32] so while he's turning to Joshua 14 there
[1:01:35] the people answer Joshua he instructs
[1:01:38] them don't settle in your land
[1:01:40] don't settle and get comfortable in your
[1:01:42] own in your inheritance through your
[1:01:44] brothers are settled but there comes a
[1:01:46] man in Joshua 14.
[1:01:49] he spent up to these people
[1:01:52] they're fighting for 40 years and some
[1:01:54] people have not gone into the land of
[1:01:55] the inheritance

[1:02:30] narratives brother Sonny
[1:02:32] brother Joshua
[1:02:36] how long
[1:02:37] must we labor to place the people in the
[1:02:40] land of the inheritance
[1:02:43] listen carefully now

[1:02:48] the Bible says he had a different Spirit
[1:02:50] upon him
[1:02:52] thank you
[1:02:53] and 14 chapters
[1:02:56] the Bible says 40 years had passed
[1:02:59] and some people are still not
[1:03:00] positionally placed in their land
[1:03:03] the land was given to them didn't we
[1:03:06] just read the Judgment marked out the
[1:03:08] inheritance
[1:03:09] they had to go and take it 40 years
[1:03:12] later they still don't have the land

[1:03:37] like brother Sonny just told you the
[1:03:39] Lord had kept him alive
[1:03:40] he's 40 and five years ever since the
[1:03:43] Lord speak this word out to Moses while
[1:03:46] the children of Israel wandered in the
[1:03:48] wilderness and now Lord I am this day

[1:05:00] and he says you know what I've tried
[1:05:02] enough to settle the people

[1:34:37] how would the Apostle Paul
[1:34:38] know this
[1:34:41] he was not there that suffered
[1:34:46] but this is a man who is led by the
[1:34:48] angel of God
[1:34:50] and listen how he phrases it
[1:34:53] I have received of the Lord
[1:34:56] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:35:01] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:35:03] which you have betrayed to bread
[1:35:06] and when he gave had given thanks he

[1:35:10] and said take it this is my body which
[1:35:13] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:35:16] of me
[1:35:20] after the same manner also he took the
[1:35:22] cup
[1:35:23] and when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:35:26] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[1:35:29] ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance
[1:35:33] of me
[1:35:35] so he has something to help you
[1:35:37] when you're taking the bread
[1:35:39] when you're drinking the wine
[1:35:41] remember what the Lord
[1:35:44] have him on your thoughts
[1:35:46] I know sometimes we have self-conscious
[1:35:48] people
[1:35:49] and everyone's worried hey somebody's
[1:35:51] watching me and somebody's thinking no
[1:35:53] you shut every other thing out
[1:35:56] and think on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:01] he says for as often as you eat this
[1:36:03] bread and drink this cup you do show
[1:36:04] forth the Lord's dead till he come
[1:36:09] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:36:11] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:36:12] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:36:15] and the blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:36:18] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:36:21] that bread and drink of that cup
[1:36:24] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:36:26] unworthily eat it and drink a damnation

[1:37:03] you and you in the Kingdom amen we are
[1:37:05] going to that marriage supplement
[1:37:10] and let's just think on the law the
[1:37:13] world has just celebrated Christmas
[1:37:20] but here we are thinking on the Lord
[1:37:24] and when I think of that goodness of
[1:37:26] Jesus
[1:37:28] what he has done for me I Was So
[1:37:31] Unworthy
[1:37:34] but yet he loved me
[1:37:36] when he was on that cross
[1:37:39] I was on his mind
[1:37:41] Jesus Christ died for your sins
[1:37:44] Jesus Christ took 39 Stripes upon his
[1:37:47] bed
[1:37:48] he bore crown of thorns
[1:37:50] they beat him
[1:37:53] and he cruelly nailed him to that Roman
[1:37:55] cross
[1:37:58] they put him in a borrow too
[1:38:02] and he paid the price for Redemption
[1:38:05] I want you to know that that price
[1:38:08] did not come easy
[1:38:10] the Bible says that he sweat great big
[1:38:13] drops of blood
