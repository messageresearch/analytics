[0:13] amen you find here that God is sending
[0:16] somebody God is saying that he's going
[0:17] to send somebody but he's sending
[0:19] somebody for a
[0:21] reason because the condition of the
[0:23] people are not where God wants them to
[0:26] be so that's the context he's saying
[0:31] behold I will send
[0:33] you so I'm going to send you Jeff I'm
[0:36] going to send you Joshua I'm going to
[0:37] send you Caleb I'm going to send you
[0:39] Tyler I'm going to send
[0:41] you a
[0:43] prophet in the spirit of Elijah amen
[0:47] before the coming of the great and
[0:49] Dreadful day of the Lord yes so God is
[0:52] going to pronounce judgment on the world
[0:54] or judgment is coming yes but he wants
[0:57] to save a people amen so that's why he's
[0:59] sending a prophet and the word of the
[1:01] Lord comes to a prophet so we know if
[1:04] he's sending Elijah the prophet he must
[1:05] be coming with a word so what's the
[1:08] purpose of sending him it's in verse six
[1:11] he's going to turn the heart of the
[1:12] fathers to the children we know that was
[1:15] in John the Baptist and the second part
[1:19] and the Heart of the children to their
[1:21] fathers lest I come and smite the with a
[1:25] curse amen let's pray father we come
[1:27] before you this evening Lord our hearts
[1:30] are humble before you we lord want to
[1:33] prostrate ourself before you now and say
[1:35] there is nothing good in us the goodness
[1:37] of our God is found in US Lord Jesus we
[1:40] thank you Lord that we can live in your
[1:41] righteousness by faith we believe you oh
[1:44] God and I pray Lord you'll speak to us
[1:45] through your precious word now and I
[1:47] pray Lord that you'll bring Clarity to
[1:49] your word oh God take away my own
[1:51] thoughts my own ideas my own desires and
[1:54] I pray Lord the Holy Ghost father will
[1:56] be Lord a shining light through me oh
[1:58] God let your glory seen in this place I
[2:01] ask in Jesus name amen amen you may be
[2:08] seated amen before I go on I want to
[2:11] read a quote to TI with that Malachi
[2:14] chapter
[2:15] 4 he says now this messenger of Malachi
[2:19] 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[2:23] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[2:27] will turn the hearts of the children to
[2:29] the fathers now watch where God starts
[2:32] God starts at the
[2:36] heart God is going to do a work and he
[2:39] realizes that the Throne of a man is in
[2:41] his
[2:42] heart so he has to start with the heart
[2:45] so Malachi 4 is going to turn the hearts
[2:47] of the children to the
[2:49] fathers and two he will reveal the
[2:52] mystery of the seven thunders in
[2:54] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[2:57] contained in the
[2:58] seals it will be these divinely revealed
[3:02] mystery truths that literally turn the
[3:04] heart of the children to the Pentecostal
[3:07] fathers exactly so yes so the most
[3:11] powerful
[3:12] people on the Earth right now is the
[3:15] wife of the Lord Jesus
[3:17] Christ amen Sons and Daughters of God
[3:21] yes the most powerful people when we are
[3:24] looking for a church and we want to see
[3:27] the Church of the Living God the one
[3:30] amen is a continuation of the Disciples
[3:32] of the Apostles we ought to be looking
[3:35] no further than
[3:38] ourselves amen hallelujah if there's a
[3:41] lack there's a
[3:43] problem if there's a deficiency there's
[3:45] a
[3:47] problem if somebody is vexed with a
[3:50] spirit you need to get to the Apostles
[3:52] of this hour you need to get the the
[3:54] Disciples of this hour and who will you
[3:57] go to yes
[4:00] amen is there a church powerful enough
[4:02] that you can have confidence to go to
[4:05] yes amen so our our thoughts so the
[4:10] heart of that scripture is that these
[4:12] people's hearts who Elijah the prophet
[4:14] coming to their hearts are filled with
[4:18] fear there is no faith there
[4:22] yeah so he is going to bring a message
[4:25] the purpose of sending Elijah is to turn
[4:28] your heart to not not nothingness is to
[4:31] turn your heart back to perfect
[4:33] [Music]
[4:35] Faith so I am saying after these years
[4:38] that we have received the message of the
[4:39] hour where is the church with perfect
[4:42] Faith amen amen and we've got to be
[4:45] hungry after it we've got to ask these
[4:47] questions and we've got to amen go after
[4:50] it
[4:53] yes and sometimes you know the Bible
[4:56] says as a man think in his heart so is
[4:59] he right yes so sometimes before we can
[5:02] even move our thoughts Hold Us
[5:06] bound a person don't have to say a word
[5:09] but his actions already tell you if he
[5:11] is a faithful man or if he's a man of
[5:15] fear a man who doesn't take action is a
[5:17] man of
[5:18] fear but a man who takes actions and
[5:21] will believe God at his word is a man of
[5:23] Faith so a person can even speak a
[5:26] positive word but in his heart he's full
[5:28] of fear word will have no
[5:31] impact it's like that boy walking
[5:34] through the graveyard whistling acting
[5:36] like he's brave but in his heart he is
[5:39] fearful I'm trying to ask you what is
[5:41] our heart condition amen what is
[5:44] stopping us from from moving into
[5:46] perfect Faith what is stopping us from
[5:49] getting to what God has visioned for our
[5:53] lives I saying that our thoughts are
[5:55] holding us
[5:57] bound we are thinking too low
[6:00] thoughts our thoughts are too Earthly
[6:04] minded and I'm saying that we as a
[6:06] church should not be happy with
[6:09] that and it's not just me saying it's
[6:11] the travail of the spirit to say Amen
[6:15] that all things are ready now and we are
[6:17] to be moving up to a higher Dimension we
[6:20] are to be the Church of the Living God
[6:22] on the earth
[6:23] now amen so a man whose heart is full of
[6:27] fear but speaking positive words his
[6:30] words mean nothing so we've got to be
[6:33] liberated in the mind and in our
[6:34] thoughts a heart that is not bound by
[6:37] fear then then faith can take a hold
[6:41] yes and what we speak we can have now
[6:44] you would know what I'm saying because
[6:45] in mark 11:24 amen let's just read it
[6:48] because if we're going to do it the
[6:49] teaching then I need to show you the
[6:51] scripture for
[6:52] it praise the
[6:57] Lord Jesus is going to revealed to the
[7:00] man whose heart is full of
[7:04] faith and I'm going to make a comment on
[7:06] prayer
[7:09] now Mark 11:24 we know 23 what it deals
[7:14] with but 24 deals with this therefore I
[7:17] say unto you what things soever you
[7:23] desire When you
[7:26] pray believe that you receive them and
[7:30] you shall have
[7:34] them
[7:35] amen where must you believe Jesus told
[7:38] us in 23 you believe in your heart
[7:45] yes so when I'm saying believe in your
[7:48] heart I'm saying our thoughts can't be
[7:50] hurly minded so in Isaiah 55 it says my
[7:54] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[7:56] am my ways are higher than your ways
[8:01] now if I'm going to bring it down to
[8:02] this I'm going to tell you that the
[8:03] prophet showed us exactly where God is
[8:06] now he said he he was God above
[8:10] us then when he he the word was made
[8:13] flesh and dwelt in Jesus he was God With
[8:18] Us and and the last part somebody tell
[8:20] me he
[8:22] God
[8:24] sorry who in
[8:26] you
[8:28] really what are powerful
[8:31] people God takes residency upon the
[8:33] throne of our
[8:35] heart but are we conscious of that are
[8:38] we conscious of it do we walk with that
[8:42] Consciousness God walking through these
[8:46] bodies amen so think higher thoughts and
[8:50] his ways are not our ways for he says
[8:52] for as the heavens are higher than the
[8:54] earth so are my ways higher than yours
[8:56] and my thoughts higher than your
[8:58] thoughts amen
[9:00] okay so I ask a question how many of us
[9:02] love
[9:03] God Amen that's going to have a meaning
[9:05] for us because to love him is to obey
[9:08] his word and then his word is not
[9:10] Grievous to us we know those are
[9:12] scriptures so if we ask ourselves are we
[9:15] hungry for
[9:20] God are we really hungry are we pursuing
[9:23] his
[9:25] presence not casual coming to church but
[9:28] are we hry for
[9:30] God are we pursuing his
[9:35] presence do and and we know that that is
[9:38] measurable yes the pursuit of his
[9:41] presence is measurable we can measure it
[9:44] by time spend in his presence we can
[9:47] measure it by the things we do to be
[9:49] half to the heart of God Amen so and and
[9:53] another question are we because if we
[9:55] saying God is in us are we available
[9:59] for God to use us yes God needs hands
[10:04] are you
[10:05] available God needs feet are you
[10:08] available God needs ears are you
[10:12] available God needs eyes are you
[10:15] available God needs a voice are we
[10:18] available am amen hallelujah now when we
[10:22] are seeing that Jesus is saying in mark
[10:25] 11:24 that prayer when you speak when
[10:29] you pray you believe that you have
[10:31] already received what you have
[10:33] asked so I'm saying prayer becomes
[10:36] prophecy
[10:41] amen thank you Lord think about it your
[10:45] prayer moves from prayer Amen to
[10:50] prophecy because what you are praying
[10:52] for is what you have already you believe
[10:55] you have already received it yes come on
[10:58] now think about it Hallelujah your
[11:00] prayer is moving past a
[11:05] petition and I want to say that prayer
[11:07] is a legal
[11:09] action prayer is
[11:13] legal amen it's the most powerful weapon
[11:16] given to access the throne room of God
[11:18] and bring down his
[11:21] presence so prayer is a legal action of
[11:24] faithful people an anointed prayer is
[11:28] announcing what is already going to
[11:30] happen am I'm going to read it again
[11:33] when you pray whatsoever you desire When
[11:36] you pray believe that you receive them
[11:38] and you shall have them so I'm not just
[11:41] praying amen hoping that God answers me
[11:45] I am praying a prophetic prayer
[11:46] believing that I've already received
[11:48] what I have asked for my prayer becomes
[11:54] prophecy
[11:56] Hallelujah so I say prophesy amen and
[12:00] prophesy again
[12:03] amen amen now I'm going to ask a
[12:06] question how many Of You' been praying
[12:08] for things amen and I'm talking about
[12:10] this year now and that you are still
[12:12] waiting for the
[12:14] answer can I see your hands maybe you're
[12:16] still trusting the Lord and he's still
[12:18] going to answer
[12:19] you amen there's still a breakthrough
[12:24] coming Hallelujah so I'm saying anointed
[12:27] prayer is announcing already what is
[12:30] going to happen yes Hallelujah we don't
[12:34] just pray and pray and pray and and hope
[12:37] that it happens Lord when are you going
[12:38] to answer prayer amen is a prophecy that
[12:41] you know God is already
[12:44] answered and then you walk in that
[12:46] Victory yes praise the Lord so prayer
[12:49] moves Beyond a request and a petition to
[12:52] believe amen that you have already
[12:54] received what you have asked for and
[12:56] that becomes prophecy I'm saying that
[12:57] again so prophetic words are spoken over
[13:00] our lives through prayer and what is
[13:03] that the groaning of the spirit in
[13:05] Romans 8 the groaning of the spirit goes
[13:07] beyond words the Bible says when we
[13:10] don't know what to pray the spirit makes
[13:12] groanings for
[13:14] us how many of you have experienced that
[13:16] the spirit making groanings for you come
[13:19] on that's Bible now Hallelujah that your
[13:22] groanings in the spirit goes beyond
[13:25] words that you don't even know how to
[13:27] pray but the Holy Ghost In You makes
[13:29] petitions make
[13:32] intercessions a
[13:35] travailing the prophet of God says here
[13:39] it's not three different gods three
[13:40] officers of one God God above us in the
[13:43] father God With Us in the son cleansing
[13:45] his way condescending coming down making
[13:48] a way for me to get back where to Eden
[13:52] right and bring his people back to
[13:54] manifested sons of God like he had them
[13:58] in the garden of Eden amen The Whole
[14:01] World's groaning and waiting for that
[14:03] hour for the manifestation of the sons
[14:05] of God yes he has no voice tonight but
[14:09] our
[14:09] voice he has no hands but our hands he
[14:13] has your hands that's whose hands it is
[14:16] he said I am the vine you are the
[14:18] branches that's in the message it is
[14:23] I so as you Ponder upon these things and
[14:26] the roman8 man I want to ask you
[14:29] what does the
[14:31] Fulfillment of the manifestation of the
[14:33] sons look
[14:36] like amen when you are looking for the
[14:39] manifestations of the Son of
[14:41] God what will it look like how will it
[14:44] impact the Earth what is the expectation
[14:47] upon the sons of God who are to be made
[14:50] known manifestation means to be made
[14:53] known what is our expectation when we
[14:56] see the sons of God made known what are
[14:59] we expecting them to
[15:02] do what will that prophecy fulfill look
[15:07] like we can quote it and say all
[15:10] creation is groaning waiting for the
[15:13] manifestation of the sons of God but
[15:15] what will that look like what is our
[15:18] expectation regarding that scripture yes
[15:21] I'm not going to give you the answer
[15:22] right now but I want you to ponder
[15:24] higher thoughts I want you to think
[15:27] higher thoughts I I want you to ponder
[15:29] upon these things Lord if I am to
[15:31] fulfill that scripture then what is your
[15:33] expectation for me when I am made
[15:38] known
[15:43] amen
[15:44] hallelujah if we go to the Book of Mark
[15:47] chapter
[15:50] 7 tonight we're going to have a prayer
[15:52] meeting amen so I'm just bringing a
[15:53] little word of
[15:55] exaltation and the reason why I'm
[15:57] announcing this is because there's a
[15:59] there's a groaning and a travailing
[16:01] inside of me and we're going to announce
[16:03] a service soon maybe in the week or next
[16:06] week that's not going to be comfortable
[16:08] for
[16:10] us and and and really we are not
[16:13] expecting everyone to respond to it even
[16:16] though we'd like everyone to respond to
[16:18] it because it's going to be
[16:21] unusual it's going to be
[16:26] inconvenient it's going to be out of the
[16:28] ordinary
[16:31] but it's for people who want to pursue
[16:33] his
[16:34] presence amen
[16:39] hallelujah the Bible says
[16:42] here I'm just looking at it now and you
[16:44] watch how the spirit is typing things
[16:46] here amen dropping in things here Mark 7
[16:50] and it happens to be verse 24 here and
[16:53] from then he rose talking about our lord
[16:56] Jesus now and when now who is Jesus
[16:58] Jesus the word made flesh everybody
[17:01] agree so he's the word made flesh and he
[17:04] went into the
[17:06] borders of Tai and
[17:09] sodon and entered into an house and
[17:12] would have no man know it so the word
[17:16] was a hidden
[17:19] word meaning it wasn't easy to
[17:22] find everybody can read that the word
[17:26] was hidden the word made flesh
[17:32] amen but watch Faith Can Do impossible
[17:35] things amen faith can make you find the
[17:39] hidden
[17:41] word
[17:43] amen it says for a certain woman whose
[17:46] young daughter had an unclean Spirit
[17:49] heard of him now Faith cometh by the
[17:53] hearing of the word so this woman heard
[17:56] about Jesus casting out demons yes and
[17:59] it Faith grew in her so she went to find
[18:02] the hidden
[18:04] word and came and fell at his feet watch
[18:08] a posture a one of worship and the woman
[18:11] was Greek Ser phenician by NA and she
[18:15] besought him that he would cast forth
[18:18] the devil out of her
[18:19] daughter but Jesus said unto her let the
[18:23] children first be filled talking about
[18:25] Israel for it is not me to take the
[18:28] children's bread and to cast it unto the
[18:33] dogs now how many of you know Jesus
[18:36] words there is as good as let there be
[18:43] light so when he's
[18:45] saying I want the children of Israel to
[18:47] eat first before I can speak to you
[18:49] Greek woman I'm not going to pay any
[18:51] attention to your request about casting
[18:53] out a demon here
[18:56] yes watch your faith now
[19:00] and she answered and said unto
[19:03] him y
[19:05] Lord yet the dogs under the table eat of
[19:09] the children's
[19:10] crumbs now I want you to notice a
[19:13] response this woman is a Greek woman she
[19:15] don't know the scriptures she heard
[19:18] about Jesus so she's got no her response
[19:21] is not based on the word
[19:24] yes her response is based upon the
[19:28] behavior and the nature of
[19:34] dogs she's saying yeah Lord but even the
[19:37] dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the
[19:40] master's table I want you to see how God
[19:44] views Faith
[19:46] yes she had no word she didn't quote
[19:49] back a scripture to the
[19:51] Lord her response was based on the
[19:53] behavior of a
[19:54] dog that the dog even eats the crumbs
[19:57] that falls from the m table she observed
[20:00] something in
[20:06] nature and he said unto
[20:08] her for this saying go thy way watch how
[20:13] he changes his words
[20:15] now he's even answering her out of
[20:19] season didn't he just announce it's now
[20:22] season for the word to go to the
[20:24] children of Israel yes but because of
[20:26] her
[20:27] faith he pulls her into the
[20:32] season
[20:34] hello some of you just raise your hands
[20:36] that you're still expecting God to
[20:37] answer your
[20:38] prayer Lord I'm trying to help you
[20:42] here but what is your faith what is your
[20:45] heart has Malachi 4 turned your heart
[20:47] back to Faith perfect
[20:48] Faith then you shall have what you
[20:52] desire I'm trying to pull you into
[20:55] season now by showing you through the
[20:57] word of God what is your response amen
[21:04] amen for this saying what's saying she
[21:07] didn't quote the word I'm trying to show
[21:08] you something she did not quote the
[21:11] word she quoted a
[21:14] natural observation of dogs behavior and
[21:17] he said for this
[21:21] saying go thy way the devil is gone out
[21:24] of thy daughter
[21:26] [Music]
[21:28] I'm saying it's twofold her faith caused
[21:32] the devil to run away combined with
[21:35] Jesus her faith in Jesus caused the
[21:38] devil to
[21:42] live and when she was come to her house
[21:45] she found the devil gone out and her
[21:48] daughter laid upon the bed

[22:32] example let me show you another example
[22:34] how me feel like another example praise
[22:37] the
[22:38] Lord let's turn to
[22:46] Matthew amen I didn't take this chapter
[22:48] down for some reason but he here we're
[22:50] talking about the Centurion Amen Let me
[22:53] just show you this very quickly even if
[22:55] you don't want to turn there amen but if
[22:57] somebody can find the chapter I've only
[22:59] got the
[23:00] verse for some reason I didn't copy the
[23:02] chapter but it's also found in Luke chap
[23:04] 7 and John chapter 4 it says and when
[23:07] Jesus entered capernium now watch all of
[23:10] these things Jesus is extending his
[23:12] borders he went into Tha and sudon and
[23:14] now he's going into capernia he's not
[23:16] staying
[23:17] isolated the word is extending their
[23:22] borders is in Matthew chapter 8 thank
[23:25] you brother s amen
[23:28] verse five yes that's
[23:34] it so those of you following in your
[23:36] Bible you can
[23:39] read he says there came a centurion now
[23:41] watch I want you to understand the
[23:43] Centurion is not a
[23:46] Christian hello the Centurion is not a
[23:50] Christian he's not a follower of
[23:54] Jesus they came a centu unto him
[23:57] beseeching him and saying Lord my
[23:59] servant lied at home sick of the pulsy
[24:01] grievously tormented and Jesus said unto
[24:05] him I will come and heal
[24:08] him there again the word
[24:11] spoken this is what I am going to do I'm
[24:14] going to come there and I'm going to
[24:15] heal it the Centurion answered and said
[24:18] Lord I am not worthy that thou should
[24:20] come under my roof but speak the word
[24:24] only and my servant shall be
[24:29] healed Centurion where are you getting
[24:31] this theology from
[24:34] yes let's find out where the Centurion
[24:36] is getting his theology
[24:40] from next verse he says I am observing
[24:43] something in the army that I am in this
[24:46] is not based on any
[24:47] word he says I am a man under Authority
[24:51] having soes under me yes and I say to
[24:55] this man go and he goeth and to another
[24:57] come and he cometh
[24:59] and to my servant do this and he doeth
[25:01] it when Jesus heard it he
[25:06] marveled and said un to them that
[25:09] followed verily I say unto you I have
[25:11] not found so great faith no not in
[25:16] Israel did he go to scripture No he was
[25:19] looking at a natural type that I is an
[25:22] mortal man I command
[25:24] Authority this man he's commanding
[25:27] spiritual Realms
[25:30] yes he says I say unto you that many
[25:34] shall come from the East and the West
[25:36] shall sit down with Abraham Isaac and
[25:38] Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the
[25:40] children of the Kingdom shall be cast
[25:42] out into outer Darkness they shall be
[25:44] weeping and nashing of teeth watch he's
[25:47] bringing a condemnation based on this
[25:49] man's
[25:50] confession because he's saying that they
[25:52] will not meet the this fith level yes
[25:57] then he goes back to him
[25:59] says Jesus said to the Centurion go thy
[26:03] way and H thou has believed I'm saying
[26:06] even if your expectation supersedes and
[26:09] it seems to be the most amen fascinating
[26:12] thing or thing that is too
[26:17] unbelievable Jesus is saying has you
[26:19] believe it
[26:22] yes I'm saying if SS never found a cure
[26:25] for something yet as you believe it you
[26:27] shall receive it
[26:28] [Music]
[26:32] I'm saying if s says that you are only
[26:34] given one man to live but as you
[26:37] believe
[26:41] amen praise the
[26:43] Lord go thy way and as thou Hast
[26:47] believed so shall it be done unto thee
[26:50] amen and the servant was healed in the
[26:53] selfs hour so ask yourself what was the
[26:57] belief in the C Ian
[27:00] heart Jesus just told him as you are
[27:03] believing you're going to receive it so
[27:05] I am saying the centurion's in the
[27:07] centurion's heart he was believing his
[27:09] servant was going to be healed at same
[27:11] hour
[27:15] yes Jesus just told him as you are
[27:18] believing you're going to receive it so
[27:20] I'm showing you the heart of the
[27:21] Centurian was believing that when Jesus
[27:24] speaks he's going to be healed at same
[27:25] hour I am saying Jesus is speaking to
[27:28] you now and what is in your heart you
[27:30] shall receive it as you desire it right
[27:35] now praise the
[27:37] Lord
[27:43] amen
[27:45] amen I think it's Matthew chapter 18
[27:48] amen I need to close now got 5 minutes
[27:50] before we can go to prayer
[28:00] amen
[28:04] hallelujah is it Luke chapter
[28:06] [Music]
[28:14] 18 Luke chapter 18 and he spake a
[28:17] parable to them to this end that men
[28:21] always that men ought always to pray
[28:26] amen and he SP make a parable unto the
[28:30] end time people and said unto them that
[28:33] you can pray when you feel
[28:35] like that you can pray
[28:39] casually he says that men ought always
[28:43] to
[28:45] pray somebody say
[28:50] always and not to faint don't get tired
[28:55] don't get weary but pray
[28:59] amen you see apart from us being a
[29:02] church of faith I want us to be a
[29:05] Praying
[29:10] Church saying now this is Jesus saying
[29:13] there was in this in a city a judge who
[29:16] feared not God neither regarded
[29:21] man and there was a widow in that City
[29:24] and she came unto him saying avenge me
[29:26] of my adversary
[29:28] and he would not for a while but
[29:31] afterward he said within
[29:33] himself though I fear not God no regard
[29:36] man yet because this woman troubleth
[29:41] me I will avenge
[29:44] her L by a continual coming she weary me
[29:49] out you see how the Lord is saying you
[29:52] don't go Weary by
[29:55] praying you can wear the Lord out let me
[29:59] put it that way by a continual coming to
[30:03] him now watch he turns it into the
[30:06] kingdom
[30:07] now he says hear what the unjust judge
[30:10] said and shall not God now watch I'm
[30:13] going to show you what kind of people
[30:15] the elect of God are it's written
[30:19] here here what the unjust judge said and
[30:22] shall not God avenge his own elect what
[30:25] does his own elect do Jesus who cry day
[30:29] and night unto him amen so God's elect
[30:33] cries day and night unto him wasn't
[30:37] there a marking Angel sent yes to Mark
[30:40] those in the city who sigh and cry for
[30:44] the Abominations done in the city so
[30:47] he's saying this is my elect how many of
[30:50] us are now saying we are God's elect but
[30:52] here's the scripture God is defining his
[30:56] elect he elect is the ones who cry day
[30:59] and night unto him though he be long
[31:02] with them I tell you that he will avenge
[31:06] them speedily nevertheless when the son
[31:08] of man
[31:10] cometh oh my word shall he find faith on
[31:14] the earth he is asking when Luke 17:30
[31:17] is fulfilled will there be a people of
[31:19] Faith raiseed up come on now don't be
[31:22] don't be
[31:23] dull that was the first son of man
[31:26] coming there but Luke 7 1730 spoke about
[31:29] even when the son of man shall reveal
[31:31] himself in the end time through a
[31:33] prophet and I say through more than a
[31:36] prophet I said the son of man is now
[31:38] revealing himself through the bride I
[31:41] said amen now he's saying when the Son
[31:43] of Man reveals himself again will he
[31:45] find the people of Faith are you the
[31:48] people of Faith
[31:51] hallelujah amen hallelujah that's the
[31:54] Sodom sign that we have seen amen
[31:58] Hallelujah with his back turned to the
[32:00] audience he discerned the heart yes and
[32:04] two amen two angels went down to Sodom
[32:09] preaching a bully Graham and an all
[32:11] Roberts oh it's a Sodom
[32:14] sign praise the
[32:16] Lord so we need Amen to have an
[32:19] abounding faith I'm so glad that
[32:22] Revelation 10 doesn't read amen like
[32:24] amen the mighty Angel gave the book to
[32:27] the Revelation 10:7 Angel and the
[32:31] Revelation 10 angel had the book and the
[32:33] angel said go and take the book from
[32:35] Revelation 10:7 Angel yes that's not how
[32:39] the reading goes the reading knew the
[32:42] writer of the book knew that the the
[32:44] literal body of the seventh angel will
[32:46] be taken off the scene but his voice
[32:48] will Thunder out and then the same angel
[32:51] that connected with that Revelation 10:7
[32:54] angel in the cave in 1946 he's the same
[32:57] angel that will connect conect with us
[32:58] now we cannot be successful in the
[33:00] message of the hour without a connection
[33:02] to the angel of the Lord no Ministry or
[33:04] progress in this hour unless he connects
[33:07] with the angel of the Lord unless he
[33:08] connects with the voice of the
[33:10] Resurrection am amen that's
[33:14] right praise the Lord
[33:19] amen so he's saying there's going to be
[33:21] the son of man is going to be revealing
[33:23] himself through a many membered body but
[33:26] can we remain in faith and persistently
[33:28] until we receive what we ask for I am
[33:31] saying amen let's just take it off our
[33:34] just our natural asking now for now for
[33:36] a moment take it off your natural asking
[33:38] take it higher amen say Lord help me to
[33:42] fulfill all my prophecies amen pull me
[33:45] into prophecy Lord pull me into season
[33:49] amen what are we believing
[33:52] for we know the parable of the friend
[33:54] who comes at midnight amen hallelujah
[33:57] praise the Lord yes and you know the
[34:00] friend comes at
[34:02] midnight I said the friend comes at
[34:05] midnight he comes at An Inconvenient
[34:07] hour that's right amen praise the Lord
[34:11] and say friend lend me three
[34:13] Loaves and the friend is amen he says I
[34:17] have a visit who has
[34:18] come and I have nothing to give him to
[34:21] eat and he says now the man in the house
[34:24] the friend who's sleeping says don't
[34:26] trouble me yes
[34:30] for the door is now
[34:32] shut and my children are in bed with me
[34:34] I cannot rise and give thee so the man
[34:36] has already spoken I can't come to you
[34:40] go
[34:41] away he says I say unto you though he
[34:44] will not rise and give him because he is
[34:47] his friend yet because of the
[34:50] importunity that word means persistent
[34:52] pestering and demanding he will rise up
[34:55] and give him as many as he
[35:02] needs
[35:04] amen I'm going to close it now and tell
[35:06] you that God is looking for a heart
[35:08] that's turned
[35:09] yes so maybe amen our heart posture
[35:13] wasn't the right way and our attitude
[35:15] towards the Lord and maybe even to pray
[35:17] is not the right way God honors a man
[35:19] who can turn his
[35:21] heart God realized he can work with the
[35:24] children of Israel and he sent Elijah on
[35:27] Mount
[35:28] to turn their hearts on the mount carel
[35:34] Showdown we find here in the book of
[35:37] Kings chapter 21 God is pronouncing to
[35:40] King
[35:42] aab
[35:43] amen now we know King ABAB was a wicked
[35:46] King he married
[35:49] Jezebel
[35:52] right he was he killed an innocent man
[35:55] he took his
[35:56] property took took his
[36:00] inheritance but God sends Elijah the
[36:03] prophet to tell
[36:06] him that he was going to utterly burn
[36:09] him up and cut off every male from his
[36:14] lineage right but hearing the words of
[36:19] Elijah changed the heart of
[36:22] aab the Bible says that he walked softly
[36:26] before the Lord and he he he took these
[36:30] words to heart and he tore his
[36:32] clothes and he put sacko instead of his
[36:35] Royal garments he fasted
[36:40] amen and he didn't let the words of
[36:43] Elijah take root to his
[36:45] heart God took notice and the Lord told
[36:48] Elijah have you seen how aab has humbled
[36:50] himself before me I'm I'm trying to show
[36:53] you something
[36:55] here he's self
[36:58] humbling is what God took notice of
[37:03] Amen no matter how Wicked he was God is
[37:06] looking for a man who can humble himself
[37:09] change his heart we know the story of
[37:12] ezekiah as
[37:13] well prophecy came over him get ready
[37:17] you're going to die humbles himself why
[37:21] scripture If my people who are called by
[37:24] my name amen will humble themselves and
[37:27] pray
[37:28] I will hear from Heaven I will come and
[37:30] I will heal the land
[37:33] amen
[37:37] amen so is this not God's window that
[37:40] was ahab's window of opportunity I am
[37:43] saying that the
[37:45] tering we're almost ready for lift off
[37:48] now to change Dimensions yes but this
[37:51] little period that we have this window
[37:53] of Grace is it not because God wants us
[37:55] to change our hearts and turn our hearts
[37:58] like the message was intended to do back
[38:00] to perfect
[38:03] faith if you say no then you're a man of
[38:06] perfect
[38:08] faith if you say no you're a man of
[38:11] perfect
[38:12] faith and what you speak must
[38:20] happen hallelujah amen so instead of us
[38:25] what what am I trying to show you
[38:26] instead of us trying to turn the heart
[38:28] of God God wants us to turn our hearts
[38:32] so he uses situations and different
[38:34] things to turn our hearts amen and
[38:37] sometimes if it's not there in faith God
[38:39] will present an opportunity to us to
[38:41] make us rise up in faith amen remember
[38:44] that okay we got many more examples you
[38:47] can find there Moses God wanted to slay
[38:50] the children of Israel Moses stepped
[38:52] into a role of
[38:53] intercession amen and God Amen God
[38:56] didn't kill him immediately amen ninev
[39:00] you know ninev God told them if you
[39:02] don't repent I'm going to come and kill
[39:03] you
[39:04] all what happened when they heard
[39:06] Jonah's message sir amen the humility of
[39:11] the king of Nineveh and the people no
[39:14] one was excluded from the prayer no one
[39:17] was excluded from the saot no one was
[39:19] exempt from the fasting and the
[39:21] repentance are you hope you hear what
[39:23] I'm
[39:24] saying don't think you're exclusive I am
[39:26] saying nobody was
[39:28] excluded nobody could say of the
[39:31] children of of the people of Nineveh you
[39:33] know what you the king and the 10 go and
[39:35] do that we'll just sit here you all
[39:38] appease God's Wrath nobody was
[39:41] exempt am I saying nobody in this church
[39:44] is exempt from pursuing the presence of
[39:48] God so what is God looking for those
[39:51] hearts who were fully committed to him
[39:52] he's looking for hearts amen full of
[39:55] honesty yes amen that will turn from sin
[39:59] turn away from sin that people God is
[40:02] looking for this church I'm closing now
[40:04] God is looking for people who not only
[40:06] talk about prayer but pray hallelujah
[40:10] thank you
[40:12] Lord amen don't just talk about turning
[40:15] from sin but actually turn away from sin
[40:17] don't just talk about reading the Bible
[40:19] but actually read the
[40:25] Bible so how many of you want more of
[40:28] God how many of you want more of God
[40:30] hallelujah you want more of
[40:34] God I'm giving you all of God am
[40:39] than who else wants more of
[40:43] God if you telling me I got more of God
[40:46] on my lap you see we we like phrases we
[40:49] like saying I want more of God makes me
[40:52] sound religious amen but more of God all
[40:55] of God is right here
[40:57] amen so when we are saying we want more
[41:00] of God
[41:02] well the word was made flesh what dwelt
[41:06] amongst us this is no different from God
[41:09] God is as good as his
[41:13] word hallelujah yes you mean the seven
[41:16] seal scroll book was the Bible became a
[41:19] new
[41:21] book some of you got shocked when I said
[41:23] yeah there's more of God here cuz then
[41:26] you realize how you beting all of
[41:28] God and how much time you really you
[41:30] saying I want all of
[41:32] God God where are
[41:42] you Mark chapter 7 as we close I say I'm
[41:45] closing closing I got to close amen but
[41:47] the spirit needs to get a point across I
[41:48] guess
[41:52] amen trying to show you the condition of
[41:54] the heart amen
[42:01] he says here in verse six he answered
[42:04] and said unto them while as asaiah
[42:07] prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is
[42:10] written this people honor me with their
[42:14] lips but their heart is far from me I'm
[42:18] in the
[42:19] message where's your
[42:23] heart amen
[42:27] how be it in vain do they worship me
[42:30] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[42:32] of
[42:33] men laying aside the Commandment of God
[42:36] you hold the tradition of
[42:39] men now we don't want that to be asked
[42:41] I'm just trying to show you how people
[42:44] can confess something with their lips
[42:46] but their heart is somewhere
[42:47] else God is not looking for
[42:52] that amen Romans chapter 10 quickly now
[43:04] Romans chapter 10 verse 8 but what say
[43:08] it the word is neither even in thy mouth
[43:12] and in
[43:15] th hope you can see the connection amen
[43:17] from the beginning I've been speaking
[43:19] about what's coming out of your mouth
[43:21] but what's in your heart the word must
[43:23] be in your mouth but the word must also
[43:25] be in Your Heart Right This is scripture
[43:27] now the word is neither even in thy
[43:29] mouth and in thy heart that is the word
[43:32] of faith which we
[43:35] preach that if thou shall confess with
[43:37] thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall
[43:39] Believe in thine heart that God had
[43:41] raised him from the dead Thou shalt be
[43:44] saved for with the heart man believeth
[43:47] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[43:50] confession is made unto salvation for
[43:53] the scripture sayth whoever believeth on
[43:56] him shall not be ashamed so true
[43:59] believing is to believe from the heart
[44:00] and a True Confession is to confess what
[44:02] is already in your heart our words as a
[44:05] man think in his heart so the word of
[44:07] faith in our heart amen must come forth
[44:10] now I tell you now when your when your
[44:12] thoughts speak louder than your word
[44:14] when your heart is full of Faith your
[44:16] thoughts govern who you
[44:19] are
[44:21] amen just your
[44:24] thoughts I'm trying to tell you that you
[44:26] have a Consciousness yes that you're a
[44:30] spirit man I'm this is a very deep thing
[44:33] that the prophet speaks about
[44:35] Consciousness and a
[44:37] subconscious you know what the prophet
[44:39] is saying those two conscious are so
[44:41] close together in a prophetic
[44:44] realm that he can be awake and he can
[44:48] see things right how many if you know
[44:50] the prophet explained
[44:52] that so what will be the people who are
[44:55] so attuned to the spirit
[44:57] I'm talking about your spirit your
[44:59] spirit being so attuned to your spirit
[45:01] being because when I read Revelation 101
[45:05] there's a people who's asked to
[45:08] prophesy so if you have to prophesy you
[45:10] have to be a prophetic
[45:13] voice and to be a prophetic voice you
[45:15] got to have a higher Consciousness yes
[45:18] so your spirit mans to be so aligned yes
[45:22] that even your thoughts catch amen
[45:27] it's discernment you can pick up right
[45:32] hallelujah amen I told you God's ways
[45:34] are higher than our ways amen let's
[45:36] leave it there let's stand together give
[45:37] God an ank up of praise worthy to be
[45:40] praised hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[45:43] amen this is a launching pad am
[45:48] amen what we spoke tonight is going to
[45:50] be a launching pad for where the Lord
[45:53] wants to take us
[45:57] we are not called to be ordinary amen I
[46:01] I feel like I am not called to be
[46:03] ordinary how many of you feel you are
[46:05] not called to be ordinary you are not to
[46:07] go with the flow yes of things amen amen
[46:12] I want to be like that salmon who
[46:14] swimming against the crowd right going
[46:17] back to father's home amen hallelujah
[46:20] hallelujah
[46:21] hallelujah praise the Lord praise the
[46:23] Lord amen we can turn the camera off
[46:26] amen hallelujah ljah
