[50:45] stages says justification in the message
[50:50] of the Masterpiece can I go quickly
[50:54] 6405
[50:55] 0705 paragraph
[50:58] 136 notice here the life that was in the
[51:03] H in the sto in the tel in the H alls in
[51:09] the seed and the life that was in the
[51:12] sto went one one went to another to make
[51:16] the other
[51:18] Isen justification made a way for
[51:22] sanctification sanctification made a way
[51:25] for the baptis
[51:27] of the Holy Ghost many times we end here
[51:30] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but go on
[51:34] it says the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:38] made a way for the Holy Ghost
[51:43] itself there is the Holy Ghost and the
[51:46] Holy Ghost
[51:48] itself that's why the prophet says the
[51:51] mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:54] without sensation but the person of
[51:57] Christ performing in you the very works
[52:01] that he did when he was he there is a
[52:05] mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:08] without sensation so the prophet is
[52:11] showing us four stages here
[52:14] justification
[52:15] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:18] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:22] itself what is the baptism of the Holy
[52:25] Ghost itself that

[52:29] adoption the token listen the token is
[52:33] the highest level of this holy ghost
[52:37] that we are talking about there is only
[52:39] one Holy Ghost but when we talk about
[52:43] the token is the last stage it's you
[52:46] know it's Visions just like Sams one you
[52:51] know it's a Sam but what is the latest

[53:32] level how many
[53:34] say how many believe are you with
[53:38] me why did the Rapture take place during

[1:29:39] appreciate God's
[1:29:41] generals I'm telling you

[1:30:34] was different from what John wrote it
[1:30:37] John was writing it with an anointing
[1:30:40] was The Gospel according to John theel
[1:30:43] Toth the gopel ACC to what toew to Mark
[1:30:48] so it's just the Gospel According to
[1:30:50] Pastor
[1:30:51] Moses I'm not the best I I'm just
[1:30:55] different to be different is not to be

[1:37:17] new B the restoration of gift then after
[1:37:20] that the adoption are we together am so
[1:37:24] listen he
[1:37:26] did says he did he might not he might
[1:37:31] not it in the depth that we get it
[1:37:38] now says received the Holy Ghost but he
[1:37:42] did not get it in the dep that you and
[1:37:45] me receive it now the death of the Holy
[1:37:49] Ghost to death is the talken is the
[1:37:52] adoption
[1:37:55] that's why the Rapture will happen in
[1:37:58] our
[1:37:59] day where the full Holy Ghost has
[1:38:03] come says the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:07] will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:10] that we have received in a measure that
[1:38:14] the power the full power of the Holy
[1:38:16] Ghost will come and the death in Christ
[1:38:20] will rise H so the rapture will happen
[1:38:24] in our day because the level of the Holy
[1:38:28] Ghost in our day is enough to trigger
[1:38:32] the
[1:38:34] [Applause]
[1:38:35] resurrection if you want Pastor kengan
[1:38:38] to rise if you want Pastor Paul M to
[1:38:41] rise we have to go higher and preach the
[1:38:45] level of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah where
[1:38:49] they can be taken out where they are do
[1:38:53] what I'm
[1:38:55] saying he without us cannot be made
[1:38:59] perfect I Reon why the Rapture did not
[1:39:03] happen in the days of God the Holy Ghost

[1:39:09] season is the Holy Ghost without
[1:39:12] measure

[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:08] [Applause]
[1:49:15] amen I
[1:49:18] said the token is the highest Vision yes
[1:49:21] sir
[1:49:24] it's it's the highest and you know
[1:49:27] brother speaks about
[1:49:30] circumcision and he says circumcision is
[1:49:33] a type of the Holy Ghost cutting off
[1:49:37] excess flesh so I want you to see where
[1:49:40] brother isting that circumcision and
[1:49:44] that to I want you to see that in the
[1:49:48] message that toen preached in 1964 maybe
[1:49:53] I'll read this then as we continue we
[1:49:55] will be explaining this but listen
[1:49:58] paragraph 49 now if you haven't got that
[1:50:02] token you will not come you will not be
[1:50:05] coming in yes you must you must have the
[1:50:09] toen that's the required
[1:50:12] price when I see the blood the blood is
[1:50:17] the token when I see the blood I'll pass
[1:50:21] over you listen you must have the token
[1:50:26] if you don't why you won't go you you
[1:50:31] youve got to have the token listen if
[1:50:35] the token was not displayed the token
[1:50:38] wasn't sh down there when the Covenant
[1:50:41] listen he says even the Covenant wasn't
[1:50:45] in effect that's serious now what's the
[1:50:49] Covenant it's circumcision because the
[1:50:52] Jews were given the Covenant of
[1:50:56] circumcision Jews were supposed to be
[1:50:58] circumcised in the E day so brother says
[1:51:02] if a Believer even if he was
[1:51:06] circumcised and denied and refuse to
[1:51:10] apply the token that Covenant yes of the
[1:51:15] circumcision was NFI it was not of
[1:51:19] effect do you now understand why it says
[1:51:22] you can receive the Holy Ghost every
[1:51:24] hour and still go to H do you now
[1:51:28] understand why John was crying how many
[1:51:31] believe that re the holy ghost in the
[1:51:34] but when there was a proclamation who is
[1:51:37] worthy to take the book and open the
[1:51:40] seals John was crying yes so if you
[1:51:43] think the Holy Ghost the new is enough
[1:51:47] why was John
[1:51:49] crying let's be
[1:51:51] honest go to say if the L did not open
[1:51:56] the book did not open the se he says the
[1:52:00] whole human was going to perish do you
[1:52:04] see can I shock you if you don't go
[1:52:09] until receiving the adoption the token
[1:52:12] there is a room of
[1:52:15] backsliding do you know that the cic
[1:52:18] church today is the original church and
[1:52:23] Hallelujah but today they are the Beast
[1:52:26] why they did not go all the way do you
[1:52:30] see my brother my
[1:52:32] sister that's serious why was joh
[1:52:36] crying he had the new and brother said
[1:52:41] if the seals were not open the whole un
[1:52:45] was going to perish and brother says
[1:52:49] when the lamb broke the seals John was
[1:52:53] rejoicing he saw his name in the
[1:52:57] PO so the real day of redemption is not
[1:53:01] when you receive the new P when the
[1:53:04] seals are open when you receive the
[1:53:07] token when you receive the
[1:53:09] adoption how many
[1:53:12] say a new is not
[1:53:15] enough how many people received a new p
[1:53:18] and went back others are drinking today
[1:53:22] others are
[1:53:23] committing but they once
[1:53:25] received a
[1:53:27] new evidence that you have received is
[1:53:30] going all the way with the word let go
[1:53:34] all the way from unto
[1:53:38] adoption
[1:53:40] am circumcision alone which is the new
[1:53:44] bir was not enough can I read it close
[1:53:48] do you love
[1:53:50] him do you love him
