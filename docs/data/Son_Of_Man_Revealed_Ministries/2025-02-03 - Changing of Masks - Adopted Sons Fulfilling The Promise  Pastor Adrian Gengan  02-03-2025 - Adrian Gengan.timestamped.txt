[4:54] main churches in
[4:56] Zimbabwe amen you'll see it's quite a
[4:58] large Church this was the Friday morning

[5:04] Believers were there but there was a
[5:06] good portion of Believers
[5:08] there uh if you ever heard of brother

[5:12] brother kichi and brother Moses and all
[5:15] of these brothers initially come from

[5:23] we spoke on uh amen the seals were open
[5:27] so that Sons could be manifested

[6:06] few years ago he fell off the boat and
[6:08] they couldn't find his body they found
[6:09] it after a few weeks he was the pastor
[6:11] of the church this is his wife a man
[6:14] still at the
[6:15] church this was the Cornerstone that was
[6:17] laid by him I like his inspiration
[6:21] because they built the shirts quite some
[6:23] time ago and if you can see right at the
[6:24] bottom he's got Revelation 10 8 to11 so
[6:27] he had recognized our part of the
[6:28] ministry amen praise the Lord amen and
[6:32] this was the afternoon service at uh buo
[6:37] this is Pastor kichi church and Pastor
[6:39] Moses and Pastor blessing had come
[6:41] through as well amen for that Services
[6:43] these are some other pastors there amen
[6:47] if you remember this
[6:49] pastor
[6:52] on Amen brother Noel he also came Amen
[6:55] to see me and uh that's Pastor Noel if
[6:59] you remember Pastor n amen he's also got
[7:02] a church there in arar and that's
[7:04] another pastor of his these are some
[7:07] worms I was forced to
[7:09] eat some tree worms they told me amen if
[7:13] I can conquer the culture if I can eat
[7:15] one of those worms amen so I said I am
[7:17] more than able so I had one of it it was
[7:20] very
[7:21] crunchy amen I know he don't look too
[7:25] good but it had no taste in particular
[7:27] you know he didn't have any taste but
[7:29] they eat that those worms are starters
[7:31] and things and it's got a lot of
[7:33] protein amen praise the Lord and these
[7:36] are some of the African dishes they told
[7:38] me to try
[7:40] out he didn't look too bad so I said
[7:42] okay I'll try it out
[7:44] amen so that was my plate you can see my
[7:46] plate didn't look too bad I was
[7:49] selective in what I chose and these were
[7:51] the brothers that were there for the
[7:52] fellowship amen so here's where amen
[7:55] they wanted to know more about the angel
[7:56] of the Lord in Exodus 23 and all of
[7:58] these things and this is I got to tell
[8:00] them about it amen and uh they were very
[8:02] very interested like grasped it very
[8:05] well amen Sunday morning this is again
[8:09] now uh at up 7 in the morning at pastor
[8:13] rhos church this is the rented building
[8:16] it's like a L-shaped church
[8:19] amen there are spok on changing
[8:22] positions and this is his uh building
[8:25] that they currently building you can see
[8:27] it's quite a beautiful building
[8:29] that they are putting up so they have
[8:32] good Vision there and they have good
[8:35] leadership so the Zimbabwe economy is
[8:38] very terrible so the currency is like uh
[8:41] non-existent there is a currency but
[8:43] there's another currency that operates
[8:45] which is the US
[8:47] dollar so they purchased they've
[8:49] converted their way of thinking even and
[8:52] everything they operate is with the US
[8:54] doll amen so can you imagine now if
[8:57] you're buying a sandwich it's $18 for me
[9:00] that's like 324 R and I'm thinking uh I
[9:03] don't want a sandwich for 300 R but then
[9:05] the brother said no you don't need to
[9:07] convert it just think US dollar cuz once
[9:10] you convert it you get very
[9:12] depressed so you amen you can't keep
[9:15] converting it amen so I just wanted to
[9:17] share those pics with you I have some
[9:18] other videos I took more videos than
[9:20] pictures and uh I just thought I'll
[9:23] share some of those things with you but
[9:25] I also wanted to share and Pastor
[9:27] blessing from eastly Tabernacle
[9:30] sent me a message the other day to tell
[9:32] me of a testimony and I thought it'll be
[9:34] encouraging for me to share the
[9:35] testimony with you because we don't
[9:37] believe in a a gospel that has got no
[9:39] manifestation amen amen so Friday
[9:42] morning I preached on the seals were
[9:44] open to bring Sons to
[9:46] manifestation and uh I was sharing with
[9:49] them how when God speaks he don't speak
[9:51] what he sees he speaks what he wants I
[9:55] took them to Genesis 1 and I showed them
[9:57] how God was looking at a dark form void
[9:59] world but when he looks he doesn't say
[10:02] hey what a formless void world he don't
[10:05] speak the problem but he spoke what he
[10:07] wanted to see and he said let there be
[10:09] light so I started to show them how the
[10:11] seals came to reposition as the sons of
[10:14] God and we now possess the ability to
[10:16] speak like that amen amen so that was
[10:19] the core of the
[10:20] sermon and uh so he told me after that
[10:23] service the brothers now in AR there's a
[10:26] lot of places with no water kind of like
[10:28] maybe year some of our places don't have
[10:32] water for months and weeks and whatever
[10:34] so they dig B
[10:36] holes so they were digging for a b hole
[10:39] after that morning service the Friday
[10:41] morning service and they had dug around
[10:43] the neighborhood and come up to the
[10:45] neighbor's yard and they kept eating dry
[10:47] wall dry wall is meaning there's no
[10:50] water around
[10:51] there so they were preparing to bring
[10:53] that drilling machine into their yard
[10:55] the believer's yard and the son told the
[10:57] father what's the Chan of us getting
[11:00] water here we've dug the entire
[11:02] neighbors houses and things there's no
[11:03] water he says there's a very slim chance
[11:06] we'll get it so the father told him
[11:08] didn't you hear what the pastor preached
[11:11] amen God don't speak what he sees he
[11:14] speaks what he want God said let there
[11:16] be light so I am saying Let There Be
[11:18] Water amen amen when they dug they hit
[11:22] the B hole and there's only water on
[11:24] their property amen let's give God
[11:27] praise now for me a big testimony
[11:30] because I wasn't on the scene all I did
[11:33] was present the word of God and somebody
[11:35] can take the word and apply it with
[11:37] faith amen and that's what the fful
[11:39] ministry is to do to position Sons and
[11:41] Daughters of God Amen and I believe
[11:44] there are many more testimonies the word
[11:46] is a seed it's swn now amen hallelujah
[11:50] and and you find amen even Pastor kich I
[11:52] was telling the church on Wednesday he's
[11:54] got a rare quality about him in that
[11:57] although he's an elder he's able ble to
[11:59] draw from younger Ministries and glean
[12:01] from them and learn from them and he's
[12:03] not afraid to say that I'm learning
[12:05] about this and can you show me more
[12:07] about this like when I told him about
[12:09] the angel of the Lord and how we need to
[12:11] connect with him amen he said bring that
[12:13] chair and tell me about it more so as we
[12:16] started to unfold these things he
[12:18] started to see these things and rejoice
[12:19] around these truths amen then again I
[12:22] was telling you that on Wednesday even
[12:23] Pastor Moses pH me and we spoke for
[12:26] another 2 hours he's wanting to learn
[12:28] more things deeper things amen
[12:30] hallelujah so we are glad amen that the
[12:33] ministry can go out and be a blessing
[12:36] amen and I seen that scripture come to
[12:38] pass
[12:39] where a prophet is without honor except
[12:42] in his own country amen because you get
[12:46] used to me preaching week after week
[12:49] amen hallelujah but when they hear it
[12:51] they hearing it
[12:53] fresh amen so they appreciate the word
[12:55] of the Lord and they did ask me to
[12:57] convey the greetings to the
[12:59] Church all the churches that I went to
[13:01] said greet the church and also to ask
[13:03] you to pray for
[13:05] them amen you see the Believers that
[13:07] left Zimbabwe didn't leave there for no
[13:09] reason the economy is really tough so
[13:12] they are trying to find a better way of
[13:14] life and a better economy but not all of
[13:16] them can leave Zimbabwe so there are a
[13:19] lot of Believers that are are back there
[13:21] amen and for them it's very difficult to
[13:24] live so they they covered your prayers
[13:27] amen and I started to tell them amen
[13:30] that they need to start to operate in
[13:31] their own economy about how God's
[13:34] economy is different from the world
[13:35] economy amen so I believe that Zimbabwe
[13:38] is right for the Supernatural and the
[13:40] miraculous before because of the hard
[13:43] conditions that they are
[13:44] under amen you don't have to have faith
[13:48] to buy a loaf of
[13:50] bread Hallelujah but they have to have
[13:53] faith amen so I pray amen that you keep
[13:56] them in prayer they were very blessed I
[13:58] can tell you that and uh they also said
[14:01] I must tell the church you'll find it on
[14:04] the video in
[14:05] easta he says tell the church that the
[14:08] Lord used you mightily to minister to
[14:11] the people of Zimbabwe so I'm just
[14:12] telling you what they are telling me
[14:14] amen so we're going to stand now for the
[14:16] reading of the
[14:17] word amen I pray you'll let a blessed
[14:21] service here as well amen amen rejoicing
[14:23] around the present day
[14:26] truths Hallelujah we'll turn to Second
[14:28] Peter chapter
[14:36] 1 from verse
[14:40] 12 it
[14:42] says wherefore I will not be negligent
[14:45] to put you always in remembrance of
[14:47] these
[14:48] things though you know
[14:51] them and be established in the present
[14:54] truth amen hallelujah to be established
[14:58] in the present truth amen the Lord are
[15:01] blessings to reading of his word you may
[15:02] be
[15:07] seated
[15:09] amen I'd like to speak this morning on
[15:12] the changing of
[15:14] masks the changing of masks my thought
[15:18] might be simple I may not be too long
[15:20] but I want you to get this point because
[15:22] I want to bring you and establish you in
[15:24] the present truth if we don't see
[15:26] ourselves the way God is expecting to
[15:28] see us in
[15:30] 2025 our expectation will be
[15:33] wrong and we can't receive what is
[15:36] Promised for today for example if we are
[15:39] trying to manifest the opening of the
[15:42] seals now in 2025 it won't work because
[15:46] the seals were opened in 1963 amen yes
[15:49] we can't bring a prophet on the age now
[15:51] in 2025 and ask God to open the seals to
[15:54] us that has already happened so we can't
[15:57] reproduce what happened
[15:59] 1963 but God has promises for each New
[16:02] Year and we want to amen live in the
[16:05] promises of 2025 how many of you can say
[16:08] amen amen praise the Lord so I'm
[16:10] speaking on the changing of masks and
[16:14] adopted Sons fulfilling the
[16:17] promise amen
[16:19] hallelujah so the changing of mask so
[16:22] 1963 changed our
[16:25] identity amen hallelujah you know that
[16:28] was a pet point in the in the ministry
[16:30] for brother Brandon and it was a pivotal
[16:33] point for a message to gather the living
[16:35] Saints
[16:38] Hallelujah so I want to show you how God
[16:40] has changed our mask you know
[16:43] that first God was the eternal spirit
[16:47] and he changed his M from Spirit to word
[16:51] to flesh he changed his Mass from this
[16:54] great spirit that
[16:57] amen covered the entire
[16:59] heavens and the Earth and then he
[17:01] condescended into the word which was
[17:04] mzed because out of this great Eternal
[17:06] being came forth the
[17:07] logos amen and that logos was MDC and
[17:11] that image was Priest and King so when
[17:14] God is saying let us make man in our own
[17:15] image he's making him in the image of
[17:17] priest and King Hallelujah so when man
[17:21] loses that image that's the image that
[17:23] must be restored to him that's why you
[17:25] find in Revelation 5 he says thou has
[17:28] made us pre PR and King because that's
[17:30] the mesic image we have to be restored
[17:33] back to what we were so God condescended
[17:35] from Spirit to word to flesh he was
[17:38] changing his mask you'll find the
[17:39] prophets telling us that amen hallelujah
[17:42] so what I want to present to you this
[17:44] morning is that the bride has also been
[17:46] changing our
[17:48] identity
[17:50] hallelujah what we once were is not
[17:52] where we are now in
[17:53] 2025 if we're going to live in the
[17:55] promises of what we once were we're
[17:57] going to miss what we are right
[18:01] now Hallelujah so he came from Spirit to
[18:05] word to flesh now the Church of Jesus
[18:08] Christ has to change a m to be perfectly
[18:11] positioned for the Fulfillment of
[18:13] Revelation
[18:16] 10821 now what if I told you that you
[18:19] can't approach Revelation 108-111 as the
[18:24] church Revelation 108-111 is a specific
[18:28] Ministry amen that the bride needs to
[18:30] change a mask and come into that
[18:33] position so you can't also going to
[18:36] break it down now you can also fulfill
[18:39] Revelation 108-111 as the Bride of Jesus
[18:44] Christ you can't fulfill Revelation 108
[18:46] to11 as the wife of Jesus
[18:49] Christ yeah you get quiet amen we'll see
[18:52] it just now I'm showing you that God has
[18:54] changed our
[18:55] mask for example who's married here
[18:59] sister El you married can I call you
[19:03] miss what's your surname
[19:10] brother muda can I call you miss muda
[19:15] why your title has
[19:17] changed right can I call Brother Caleb a
[19:20] single
[19:22] man no because his role his title and
[19:25] everything has
[19:26] changed Hallelujah
[19:29] praise the Lorden he's now a
[19:32] father so if I don't so if the daughter
[19:35] wants to make claims on brother Caleb
[19:37] she can't call him husband she don't
[19:40] have claims on him as
[19:42] husband she has claims on him as
[19:45] daughter praise the Lord I pray amen as
[19:48] I speak this you'll be able to catch
[19:49] what I saying so that's why I'm saying
[19:52] there's a particular reason in
[19:54] Revelation chap 5 that John could not
[19:56] take the book
[19:59] how many of you remember the Revelation
[20:01] chapter 5 nobody could take the book
[20:04] they were looking for a near Kinsman
[20:07] somebody who could take the book and
[20:10] John could not take the book but ask
[20:13] ourselves why could not John take the
[20:14] book in Revelation 5 but he can take it
[20:17] in Revelation 10 something changed and
[20:20] it was his position it was his role it
[20:24] was his title he had
[20:27] transitioned Hallelujah
[20:29] amen so he can't take it in Revelation 5
[20:32] but he can take it in Revelation 10 what
[20:36] changed amen so I'll give you a brief
[20:38] description in Revelation 5 the seals
[20:41] are not open
[20:43] yes yes hallelujah amen the seals are
[20:47] not open so he can't
[20:49] connect amen there's a dividing line
[20:52] there you remember he sees John John is
[20:56] sitting as one of the elders around the
[20:57] throne
[20:59] so John sees John the prophet says but
[21:02] there's a dividing line he can't connect
[21:04] with the other dimension he can't
[21:06] connect back with his
[21:08] theophany so the seals have to be broken
[21:11] because the seals reconnect us the seals
[21:15] acts as a bridge to cross over amen yes
[21:21] Hallelujah that is one part of the seals
[21:24] we know the seals the prophet says the
[21:26] seven seal especially it's like a rocket
[21:27] that goes up
[21:29] it just keeps unfolding and unfolding
[21:30] and
[21:32] unfolding praise the
[21:34] Lord but one of it is for us to
[21:37] reconnect with our theopen body to
[21:39] reconnect with our true identity so like
[21:42] I'm saying now the seals were not open
[21:45] and the opening of The Seven Seals was
[21:47] to reveal
[21:48] Christ somebody say
[21:52] Amen so the little book the title de of
[21:54] man's inheritance can only be brought
[21:56] back to the legal owners of the Earth
[22:00] yes praise the
[22:02] Lord amen and you know that not everyone
[22:05] is called to the reading of the will
[22:08] only those whose names are in the world
[22:10] Amen will be called to come to hear what
[22:13] is in the will
[22:16] Hallelujah so by the time we get to
[22:18] Revelation 108-111 the bride has changed
[22:21] mask in this unfolding
[22:23] drama Hallelujah
[22:29] amen let's just get down to our first
[22:31] point there let's take Esra 2 and verse
[22:36] 5 I'll just use Esther as a type to show
[22:43] you now in shusa in the palace there was
[22:45] a certain Jew whose name was Mori the
[22:48] son of Ja the son of shimi the son of
[22:51] Kish a benjamite who had been carried
[22:54] away from Jerusalem with the Captivity
[22:56] which had been carried away with king of
[22:59] Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of
[23:01] Babylon had carried
[23:03] away so they are trapped in a Babylonian
[23:07] system right we are just told now that
[23:10] They Carried Away in captivity so they
[23:12] are trapped in a Babylonian system the
[23:15] same type of how we were trapped in a
[23:16] Babylonian system in this day
[23:20] yes so he brought up a Desa that is
[23:23] Esther his uncle's daughter for she had
[23:25] neither father nor mother so they again
[23:28] she's typing
[23:30] mes praise the Lord without father or
[23:36] mother and the maid was fair and
[23:38] beautiful when morah when her father and
[23:40] mother were dead took for his own
[23:43] daughter now watch now when it came to
[23:45] pass when the king's commandment and
[23:47] decree Was
[23:49] Heard and when the maidens were gathered
[23:51] together unto shushan in the palace to
[23:54] the custody of AI that Esther was also
[23:57] brought unto the the King's
[23:59] house so she's no she's a she's now a
[24:03] called out
[24:04] people she's no longer regarded as part
[24:07] of the Captivity is everybody getting
[24:09] what I'm saying there are those that are
[24:11] trapped under the Babylonian system but
[24:13] Esther is a called out
[24:16] group amen Revelation 18 and4 I'm going
[24:20] to reemphasize this point here and I
[24:22] heard another voice from Heaven
[24:24] Revelation
[24:26] 18:4 saying come on of her my people be
[24:30] not partakers of her sin
[24:32] amen that you receive not of her plagues
[24:36] now if you know what a called out people
[24:38] is
[24:39] called amen you can put up the next
[24:42] quote a called out people as a specific
[24:46] title and he says as God led the church
[24:48] in the natural in that day he's leading
[24:51] the church in the spiritual in this day
[24:53] do you believe it they were the people
[24:55] of God until they were called out of
[24:57] Egypt and then they became the Church of
[24:59] God the word church means called out so
[25:03] like Esther was a called out
[25:05] bride people we have been called out
[25:09] from every
[25:10] denomination but that was our position
[25:13] you can't revert to us now and still
[25:15] refer to us as he called our people
[25:18] because our position has
[25:20] changed so he called out people brother
[25:23] gram is saying is Ecclesia is the church
[25:28] so at one stage we were called
[25:31] out from every denomination and we were
[25:34] called The Church of the Living
[25:36] God Amen they were called out of Egypt
[25:40] and we called out of the world A
[25:42] peculiar people to serve
[25:44] God now brother br will say in the signs
[25:46] of his coming he says don't you believe
[25:49] the Pentecostal Church in all of its ups
[25:50] and downs I believe that there is an
[25:52] elected called out group of
[25:54] people God will take the elected out of
[25:57] the Pentecostal group and shape it in
[25:59] that coming Stone he talking about The
[26:01] Headstone now the pyramid
[26:04] amen that would
[26:06] fit like that to bring the roof down to
[26:09] bring the cap Stone and this church will
[26:11] have to be the same Ministry and Jesus
[26:14] testified of the same thing now I say
[26:17] before we can go to fulfilling John
[26:19] 14:12 where Greater Works than the shall
[26:22] he do we must match Jesus first
[26:26] Works Hallelujah
[26:31] how many of us are expecting to do the
[26:33] Greater Works without doing what Jesus
[26:36] did our expectation is wrong if Jesus is
[26:39] saying Greater Works than the shall he
[26:41] do for I go unto my father then our
[26:44] capability must be able to match what
[26:46] Jesus
[26:48] did because we are ears of the father
[26:51] and Joint tears with the son and Joint
[26:54] ears doesn't mean that you are different
[26:56] from
[26:56] Jesus what is brother Bram saying here
[26:59] they'll have the same
[27:00] Ministry Jesus testified of the same
[27:04] thing now I'm asking you another
[27:06] question what have we done with the
[27:08] promised word for
[27:11] today if we have just taken the
[27:14] revelation of the word and I just
[27:16] rejoicing with the revelation of the
[27:17] word something is wrong
[27:20] yes God is not expecting us to remain in
[27:23] just the revelation of the word the
[27:25] revelation of the word has got to
[27:27] produce something
[27:29] when God said when God spoke these words
[27:32] let there be
[27:33] light God's word did not come back to
[27:36] him
[27:39] empty God spoke words but what came
[27:43] back light came
[27:46] back praise the Lord so when God is
[27:49] giving us the revelation of his
[27:51] word I'm giving you the revelation of
[27:54] the
[27:56] word God is not expecting you to give
[27:58] him back the revelation of the
[28:01] word amen he said my word will not
[28:05] return unto me
[28:06] void praise the Lord amen hallelujah
[28:10] amen when you speak a word you are not
[28:13] expecting your word to come back to you
[28:15] you're expecting your word to manifest
[28:17] into something else so when God is
[28:19] sending forth the revelation of the word
[28:21] he's expecting the manifestation to come
[28:23] back to himen yes
[28:25] Lord yes Lord hallelujah Hallelujah God
[28:29] is not revealing things to us for us to
[28:31] tell him can you imagine God telling us
[28:33] now because let's all admit
[28:36] this when he is explaining baptism in
[28:39] Jesus name that's a revelation of the
[28:42] word baptism in the name of the Lord
[28:44] Jesus Christ but who must manifest that
[28:48] yes can we just go around telling
[28:50] everyone the true baptism is in the name
[28:51] of the Lord Jesus Christ no we must
[28:55] manifest it and be baptized in the name
[28:57] of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ when we
[28:59] are worshiping God we are know we not
[29:01] worshiping a trinity of gods because the
[29:04] mystery of God has been revealed can you
[29:05] say Amen so now when we're worshiping
[29:07] God we know it is one God revealing
[29:10] himself in three different offices so
[29:13] our worship must change and we must now
[29:15] fulfill God is seeking those who Worship
[29:17] in spirit and in truth so he's looking
[29:20] for a manifestation of that so can you
[29:23] imagine now we never knew that Malachi
[29:25] 4: 5 and
[29:26] 6 was
[29:29] God talking to us and speaking about
[29:31] William
[29:32] brandom we never knew there was a
[29:35] two-fold prophecy in that scripture the
[29:37] first part was John the Baptist and the
[29:39] second part was William Brandon we
[29:41] didn't know that but it was revealed to
[29:43] us same with revelation 10:7 we didn't
[29:47] know who that seventh angel was but now
[29:49] we know
[29:50] better but my point for telling you that
[29:52] when God is coming back to us now we
[29:55] can't go back to God and say Lord you
[29:57] sent me like to the
[30:00] prophet what is God looking
[30:03] for because if you read Malachi 4:5 and
[30:06] 6 is God talking to William brandham or
[30:09] is he talking to
[30:12] you what does Malachi you need to put it
[30:15] up brother as I'm giving these
[30:16] scriptures Malachi 4: 5 and 6 you know I
[30:19] got a lot of younger people here that
[30:21] may not know the scriptures so when
[30:23] you're putting these scriptures you read
[30:24] it it's saying behold I send you amen so
[30:28] it's a personal conversation to you and
[30:31] I don't know if you will ignore God when
[30:32] he's
[30:34] speaking nobody will ignore God so we
[30:37] ought to be paying attention when God is
[30:38] saying behold I sent you Elijah the
[30:41] prophet so what God is looking for is
[30:43] that last part when God is saying I'm
[30:46] going to send you Elijah the prophet
[30:47] when he's coming back he's looking for
[30:49] the Fulfillment you need to get to the
[30:51] next
[30:52] verse where the hearts of now the
[30:54] children are turned back to the fathers
[30:58] we can't tell God you sent me Elijah the
[31:00] prophet and our heart not be turned back
[31:03] is everybody getting my point when God
[31:05] is coming back he's looking for that
[31:07] manifestation so we can't just Rejoice
[31:09] around God sent a prophet God sent a
[31:11] prophet then the question is if he sent
[31:13] the prophet I have our hearts been
[31:15] turned back yes that's what God is
[31:17] looking for amen and I tied that there
[31:20] with Matthew 25 that the talents were
[31:23] given and the last part where the one
[31:25] that hit it in the ground
[31:28] did nothing with the word meaning he
[31:30] didn't manifest the
[31:32] word he kept telling God back you send a
[31:35] prophet but it's written in the word
[31:37] behold I sent you the prophet so God is
[31:39] not looking for us to quote back the
[31:41] word to him he's looking for us to
[31:44] manifest the word hallelujah hallelujah
[31:47] so all the Revelation that's the point I
[31:49] was trying to make when the seals are
[31:51] open God is revealing it to us he's not
[31:54] expecting back an utterance of
[31:56] Revelation he's expecting back a
[31:58] manifestation of the sons of God back on
[32:00] the
[32:02] earth praise the
[32:05] Lord so we're reading in Revelation 18:4
[32:09] that a people is called out come out of
[32:11] her my people so can we say that we were
[32:15] a called our people according to the
[32:17] Scripture A called our people and like
[32:20] we are saying a called our people means
[32:22] a church means
[32:24] Ecclesia but the prophet is going to
[32:26] change the scene in 196
[32:28] three because in order for us now to
[32:31] receive the seals our position needs to
[32:34] change we can't be called a called our
[32:37] people we can't be called the church
[32:40] anymore so brother brandham says
[32:43] here in the first seal now he's going to
[32:46] start preaching the seals he says and
[32:48] it's only to be revealed at the last day
[32:52] amen when the actual seal is broken
[32:56] broken to who not not to
[32:59] Christ but to the church notice oh my
[33:03] that just makes me tremble I hope that
[33:05] the church truly understands it what I
[33:07] mean you people I'm going to call you
[33:12] bride so you're are not just a nominal
[33:15] church
[33:16] now bride means that you've been a
[33:18] spoused to
[33:20] somebody bride means can you imagine
[33:22] from church you didn't have any title
[33:26] you didn't have any privileges
[33:28] but now he's telling you God has chosen
[33:31] you to be bride and a bride is to be
[33:36] married
[33:38] Hallelujah so the prophet changes our
[33:40] position at the first seal he changes
[33:43] our mask is somebody getting this the
[33:47] prophet changes our mask when he's
[33:49] preaching the first seal we take the
[33:52] church mask off and we put on the bride
[33:54] mask hallelujah praise the Lord
[33:58] now in the message Jesus Christ the same
[34:00] yesterday today and forever he says this
[34:02] is the Lord Jesus Christ in the form of
[34:05] the Holy
[34:07] Spirit Right Moving among his
[34:12] people doing the same thing he did when
[34:14] he was here on Earth identifying with
[34:17] his
[34:18] bride hallelujah amen don't lose me this
[34:23] morning he who is he identifying himself
[34:25] with the bride and he says not
[34:28] the so can we say that point is toal
[34:31] clear God is not identifying himself
[34:33] with the church he's identifying himself
[34:36] with the bride and can I progress the
[34:38] thought of brother Brandon there when
[34:40] he's saying Jesus Christ is in the form
[34:42] of the Holy
[34:43] Spirit and now I'm going to say that if
[34:45] the holy spirit is tabernacling us then
[34:48] we are the holy spirit in the form of
[34:49] the
[34:52] Bride come on
[34:54] now he's
[34:56] condescending the holy Spirit was not s
[34:58] to float around the air so when we are
[35:01] looking at you now we are seeing the
[35:02] holy spirit in the form of his church in
[35:05] the form of his bride
[35:08] yes yes yes and that is not a strange
[35:13] thought because man's original Spirit
[35:16] was the Holy Spirit that's the
[35:17] inheritance that he
[35:19] lost praise the Lord let's progress this
[35:22] thing now he says there's a difference
[35:25] between the church and the bride the
[35:27] church goes through the tribulation so
[35:29] how many of you still want to be called
[35:30] the
[35:31] church he says that six seal to purify
[35:35] but the bride don't she goes in the
[35:37] Rapture before that it's time for the
[35:39] bride to be called out so now I believe
[35:42] it's calling out
[35:44] time praise the Lord that is still now
[35:46] you can see in the sixth month there
[35:49] Hallelujah now in the seventh
[35:52] seal because remember the seventh seal
[35:54] is going to reveal your name in the book
[35:57] but a bride is only Bride for one
[36:01] day when you're coming down the aisle
[36:03] they're praying Here Comes the Bride
[36:06] Here Comes the
[36:08] Bride praise the
[36:11] Lord but when you say your marriage vows
[36:14] when you leave that altar you don't go
[36:17] out as the bride you're going out now as
[36:21] the
[36:22] wife they say don't they say I present
[36:24] to you Mr and Mrs
[36:27] I Now Pronounce You man and
[36:30] wife come on now have you been to
[36:32] wedings brother Caleb yours was the last
[36:34] waiting here we need another
[36:36] wedding praise the Lord how many of you
[36:39] want to have another
[36:40] wedding
[36:42] nobody nobody wants wearing
[36:47] briani he's going to change it now
[36:49] because bride can only be for a short
[36:51] period of
[36:53] time
[36:55] Hallelujah who wants to have a long
[36:57] wedding ceremony just bright bright
[36:59] bright brother brand says there's been
[37:01] churches churches Brides brides but
[37:03] there must come one who's willing to
[37:05] take his name now remember when you
[37:08] leave there you also don't come in with
[37:09] the name that you came to the
[37:11] altar
[37:13] Hallelujah my wife is not a Nicholson
[37:17] ganger praise the
[37:20] Lord she had to leave the old name and
[37:23] take on a new name same the Bride of the
[37:25] Jesus Christ now remember when you
[37:27] coming to the altar to be married we
[37:29] come there one way and we live with his
[37:31] name yes amen amen so we got to know in
[37:36] what Authority we are praying when we
[37:38] are saying in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:39] Christ
[37:42] amen if we are picturing it as far off
[37:44] as a name disconnected from us he says
[37:47] that's why we don't see the Miracles he
[37:50] says that's why we don't get the results
[37:52] because we are not speaking in the
[37:54] authority of that name amen then we are
[37:57] speaking in somebody else's name oh if
[37:59] somebody can just get this we are not
[38:02] speaking in the name of Jesus Christ as
[38:04] somebody
[38:05] else we are the married wife of the Lord
[38:08] Jesus Christ so we are speaking in our
[38:11] position of our
[38:14] name so he says here now in the seventh
[38:16] seal very important he says we can see
[38:19] the bride taking on the form putting on
[38:21] the wedding garment making
[38:24] ready what was the Garment the opening
[38:27] of the seals now he's now presenting the
[38:30] Garment so she must now fulfill
[38:32] Revelation 19
[38:34] and7 praise the Lord he says here
[38:37] further now in identified
[38:39] Masterpiece he says he has cut wants to
[38:43] cut the church out just like he did the
[38:45] Sun out like he did the bride and group
[38:47] to be his bride you must be a part of
[38:49] him not part of creed not part of the
[38:52] church not part of denomination be part
[38:55] of him amen
[38:58] he says you have to be Hood from the
[38:59] word the world cut off from
[39:02] you so if we have any expectation to be
[39:05] coming now to the union where we are the
[39:07] bride of Christ you can't have any bit
[39:09] of the world hanging so which means we
[39:12] need to give up alcohol we need to give
[39:14] up smoking we need to give up drugs we
[39:17] need to give up womanizing we need to
[39:19] give up adulteries we need to give up
[39:21] fornication we need to give up
[39:23] pornography we need to give up the
[39:25] movies we need to give up everything of
[39:27] the world
[39:28] or can somebody say a better amen than
[39:30] that because when you're coming now to
[39:32] be married you are giving off your
[39:35] rights you're basically leaving your old
[39:38] way of living like Rebecca left her old
[39:40] way of
[39:42] life so we can't claim this part of
[39:45] coming to the bride and we're still
[39:46] holding on to the things of the world
[39:48] Christ won't marry
[39:50] you
[39:54] amen he says the sculpture is counting
[39:57] on you
[39:58] you tell your neighbor Jesus is counting
[40:01] on
[40:02] you don't let him
[40:04] down he says willing to stand and have
[40:07] yourself shaped into the likeness of his
[40:10] requirement that the word
[40:13] requires in the last days I poured my
[40:15] spirit upon the whole flesh your sons
[40:17] and daughters shall prophesy Christ is
[40:20] identified Masterpiece of the word made
[40:22] flesh listen to what he says you are you
[40:26] are asked to identify yourself in him by
[40:28] the same word to be the Masterpiece for
[40:31] the
[40:32] bride therefore we gladly received the
[40:35] word and now you can put up Revelation
[40:36] 19:7 there it says let us be glad and
[40:39] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[40:42] marriage of the Lamb is
[40:44] come so he's called out a people changed
[40:47] the identity to say I'm going to marry
[40:49] you and now he's giving you the Garment
[40:51] to be
[40:53] clothing bringing you closer now keep
[40:55] changing your mask oh
[40:59] yes Hallelujah for now what
[41:03] is his
[41:05] bride his wife had made herself
[41:10] ready praise the Lord and to her was
[41:14] granted that she be RA in fine linen oh
[41:17] yes Lord amen clean and white amen for
[41:20] the fine linen is the righteousness of
[41:22] the Saints so he gave us the waiting
[41:24] garment and tell me what else is
[41:27] presented at a wedding beside the
[41:30] Garment a ring so when did we receive
[41:34] the ring amen let's see what brother
[41:36] Bron tells us
[41:39] here
[41:44] amen hallelujah let's skip the next qu
[41:47] proving his word and go to the next one
[41:49] amen 277 it says brother Bram is saying
[41:52] we were given a ring right it says and
[41:56] you are wearing the weding weding band
[41:58] of predestinated unmerited Grace a
[42:01] wedding band of Grace unmerited of your
[42:04] own God did it himself he knew you
[42:07] before the foundation of the world so he

[53:36] to him on the
[53:38] stage what would have happened he was
[53:41] one more confession away from his
[53:45] healing and I'm challenging you maybe
[53:47] some of you sitting here today are one
[53:49] confession away from your healing one
[53:52] confession away from your breakthrough
[53:54] is somebody out here receiving it maybe
[53:56] you're one confession away from that
[53:58] miracle that you've been trusting the
[54:00] Lord maybe all this time you've been
[54:02] confessing it but you're one more
[54:04] confession away from it can somebody
[54:06] receive that word even now and say I am
[54:08] one more confession away from
[54:11] it we've seen enough of the supernatural
[54:14] around us to know that he is Hebrews 138
[54:17] he's the same yesterday today and
[54:18] forever amen praise the Lord oh
[54:21] beautiful Hallelujah so let's keep
[54:24] maintaining our confession let's keep
[54:26] speaking the word of God Amen let's
[54:28] progress to thought now so when son of
[54:30] man is revealed through our bodies it
[54:32] will manifest him again on the earth so
[54:35] don't put limitations off of God if the
[54:37] water is coming before you be bold live
[54:40] in a world of perfect Faith put your
[54:42] foot upon that water upon those waves
[54:45] upon those waging Seas upon those
[54:47] doctor's reports upon amen your negative
[54:49] report at work upon him and your child
[54:52] put your feet upon that water and start
[54:54] to walk across your problems start to
[54:57] face your
[54:58] [Applause]
[55:00] problems
[55:02] hallelujah praise the
[55:05] Lord so now if if brother Brandon
[55:08] changed our position from called out
[55:10] people that's the church to bride to
[55:13] wife why is any wife given let's put up
[55:16] the next quote I need to go quickly now
[55:18] why is a wife given brother bran will
[55:19] tell us why a wife is given not for you
[55:21] to play uh running around the tree
[55:25] with amen
[55:27] Hallelujah not for IND the movie where
[55:29] you going to run around the tree and
[55:30] sing Love
[55:31] Songs
[55:33] Hallelujah he says not this one
[55:36] brother the first son
[55:39] Adam the first son Adam was the spoken
[55:43] seed word of God he was given a bride to
[55:46] do what reproduce
[55:49] himself now watch while we were watching
[55:52] ourselves change Mas was Jesus also
[55:55] changing
[55:57] because he was once called the
[55:59] bridegroom somebody following like we
[56:02] were called The Bride but when we
[56:04] married us he is now the husband and we
[56:06] are the wife so as we are changing as he
[56:09] is changing we are
[56:11] changing praise the
[56:13] Lord so he says you need to go back to
[56:16] that I'm not done the first son Adam was
[56:19] the spoken seed word of God now you know
[56:22] why Adam could not speak spiritual
[56:24] multiplication and go to
[56:26] and say Eve you shall have a son and his
[56:30] name Shall be Called Abel why because no
[56:35] seed is the
[56:38] fruit is somebody catching what I'm
[56:40] saying you can't expect the seed to be
[56:44] in its
[56:46] maturity brother Gran is calling him a
[56:49] spoken seed word of God which means he
[56:54] must come to a mature state of the
[56:57] word is somebody seeing that is a seed
[57:01] word of God but he must grow into
[57:03] maturity that's the likeness we've been
[57:05] telling you about you are to grow into
[57:08] the likeness of Jesus Christ and come
[57:10] into the mature state of the word and
[57:12] the mature state of the word is
[57:16] mesic
[57:17] hallelujah image means character nature
[57:20] of
[57:21] Christ likeness means to function like
[57:24] God so every day he was developing to
[57:27] function he was speaking to winds he was
[57:29] speaking to waves he was speaking to
[57:31] animal life but he was growing up to the
[57:33] mat state of the word but it says Eve
[57:36] chose to mingle a seed illegally and she
[57:40] couldn't wait for Adam to come to the
[57:42] mature state of the
[57:44] word
[57:46] hallelujah where he could speak and say
[57:49] you shall have a
[57:50] son Hallelujah so you can see brother
[57:53] Bram is saying Adam was a spoken word of
[57:57] God he was given a bride to reproduce
[58:00] himself reproduce himself produce
[58:03] another Son of God now why do you think
[58:05] Jesus is given a bride a wife he wants
[58:09] to reproduce his
[58:13] life Hallelujah you're in the Rapture
[58:15] message now you know this is one of the
[58:17] last messages he's preaching Jesus wants
[58:21] fruit for
[58:23] himself his wife must bring forth the
[58:26] the kind of children that he is what
[58:28] kind of children brother brandham he's
[58:30] saying bright children we
[58:33] children
[58:35] Hallelujah the next quote I need to go
[58:37] quick now the church is married to
[58:39] Christ we are the wife of Christ
[58:42] bringing
[58:43] forth amen so as our Mas change
[58:47] now
[58:49] hello our mask is changed from a called
[58:52] out people our mask has changed from the
[58:54] bride our mask is Chang CH from the
[58:57] married wife to sons of
[59:01] God the life that we are producing is
[59:03] the Life of Christ and that's why John
[59:06] in one one John it says 1 John 3
[59:10] and2 it says beloved now are we the sons
[59:13] of
[59:16] God
[59:19] hallelujah now are we the sons of God
[59:22] and it do not appear what we shall be
[59:24] but we know that when he shall appear we
[59:26] shall be like him for for we shall see
[59:29] him as he is right let's go up to that
[59:31] one more quote there the one I skipped
[59:33] now he says God is depending on you as a
[59:36] member of his body to Bear the fruit of
[59:40] the spirit so God is depending on you
[59:42] Sarah to bring forth the promisel God is
[59:46] depending on you brother and sister to
[59:48] bring forth the Life of Christ the image
[59:51] of Christ that life is what all creation
[59:54] is waiting for
[59:56] that manifestation is what Romans 8 is
[59:58] waiting for but we can't can't come at
[1:00:01] this point to reproduce The Life of
[1:00:03] Christ without being called out without
[1:00:06] being put as a bride without coming into
[1:00:09] the marriage ceremony seeing the son of
[1:00:11] man William brandham unite the bride and
[1:00:14] the CH and the groom we can't come to
[1:00:16] this point where he puts his word in us
[1:00:19] to see and we are now producing The Life
[1:00:21] of Christ which puts us in position of
[1:00:24] the Roman 8 man
[1:00:26] God is depending on you somebody say
[1:00:29] this God is depending on
[1:00:32] me right as a member of the body to Bear
[1:00:35] the fruit of the spirit and if he is
[1:00:38] depending on you let's open up our
[1:00:40] channels let the Holy Spirit coming
[1:00:42] tonight energize us free us from all
[1:00:45] fears and doubts revivals
[1:00:49] come
[1:00:51] Hallelujah he says in Ephesians 1 and5
[1:00:55] that remember I'm going to reemphasize
[1:00:57] this we were not predestinated to be the
[1:00:59] Church of God that was one stage of the
[1:01:03] journey predestinate means what your end
[1:01:06] destination is going to
[1:01:08] be if you are going on the journey from
[1:01:12] here to Israel your predestination is
[1:01:15] Israel you may have a stop over in Dubai
[1:01:19] but that's just a stop
[1:01:21] over
[1:01:23] Hallelujah you're predestined
[1:01:26] to go to
[1:01:29] Israel what were we predestined for not
[1:01:32] to be the church not only to be the
[1:01:34] bride not only to be the wife let's see
[1:01:37] what the Bible is saying we were
[1:01:38] predestined to be having predestinated
[1:01:42] us unto adoption of children by Jesus
[1:01:45] Christ to
[1:01:46] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:01:48] of his will so when God finally sees us
[1:01:51] our end results he's seeing us as
[1:01:53] manifested sons of God upon the face of
[1:01:56] the Earth he seeing Adam back on the
[1:01:59] earth
[1:02:01] Hallelujah one more quote here in modern
[1:02:03] events make clear by prophecy he says
[1:02:06] then if you're a son and daughter of God
[1:02:08] you in God all the time in knew what bed
[1:02:11] in time you would be
[1:02:13] planted so now you're made a creature a
[1:02:16] Son of God manifested son daughter of
[1:02:19] God to meet the challenge of this hour
[1:02:21] to vindicate the true and living God of
[1:02:23] this hour the message is coming forth in
[1:02:26] this time hallelujah praise the
[1:02:30] Lord oh can somebody say this now so who
[1:02:34] is the one that's going to be standing
[1:02:36] there in Revelation 10:
[1:02:39] 8-11 is it going to be the called our
[1:02:42] church is it going to be the Bride of
[1:02:44] Jesus Christ is it going to be the
[1:02:47] married wife of the Lord Jesus Christ or
[1:02:49] is it going to be an adopted son of God
[1:02:51] because Adam lost the book in Genesis 3
[1:02:55] and revelation 10 Adam must be back on
[1:02:57] the earth to receive the
[1:03:01] book so we're on a journey started in
[1:03:05] the mind of God
[1:03:08] am so he predestinated us to be the
[1:03:11] Romans 8 man waiting on the earth to
[1:03:15] take the book now that's why it hasn't
[1:03:18] worked people have been trying to take
[1:03:20] the book as
[1:03:21] bride won't work why you're not adopted
[1:03:26] as bride you don't have his name yeah
[1:03:29] yet as married wife you have his name
[1:03:32] amen can somebody say Amen as married
[1:03:34] wife you have his name but as married
