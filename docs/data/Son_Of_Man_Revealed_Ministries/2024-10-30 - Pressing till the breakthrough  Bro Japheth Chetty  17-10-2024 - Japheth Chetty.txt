things to go into Warfare 4 amen strategic Battle Points am amen so the word can come and direct us and then we can go into prayer into spiritual warfare amen hallelujah so Philippians CH 3:3 brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind yes and reaching forth unto those things which are be which are before verse 14 I press to the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen may God add blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so tonight we're going to talk on persevering until the Breakthrough amen amen pressing until the Breakthrough amen so I just want to read the Amplified version before we go on cuz I like how the Amplified version puts it and I'll read uh the whole chapter from verse one finally my fellow Believers continue to rejoice and Delight in the Lord to write the same things again is no trouble for me it is a savu for you paulia look out for the dogs look out for the troublemakers look out for the false circumcision amen those who claim circumcision is necessary for salvation for we who are born again who have been reborn from above spiritually transformed renewed and set apart for his purpose are the true circumcision amen so these are the true circumcision those that have been reborn amen spiritually transformed who Worship in the spirit of God and glory and take pride and exalt in Christ Jesus and place no confidence in the flesh though I my myself might have confidence in the flesh amen we know this famous scripture from Paul Paul where he says he was of The Tribe of Benjamin amen he is a Hebrew of Hebrews so Paul had every reason to glory in the flesh amen just like we can say Amen we had we have every reason to Glory because we've had the opening of the word we've had all of the Mysteries and all of these things amen we can glory in those things but Paul goes on here to say that amen he counts it all as nothing but he counts what he counts import is the righteousness in Christ Jesus that is found in US amen amen amen and the resurrection of his power amen he goes on to say not that I have obtained it this goal of being Christlike so he's saying I haven't obtained this goal of being Christlike yet I haven't obtained Perfection as yet but he says I actively press on so that I may take hold of that Perfection so we've not obtained Perfection yet we are we are striving for Perfection amen but Paul is saying because we have not obtained it yet we are actively pressing towards that markl amen we are not just saying that we are coming un Perfection but we are actively doing something about it he says brothers and sisters I do not consider that I have made it my own yet but one thing I do forgetting what lies behind me amen it's important to look back and see what God has done but in order to strive to Perfection we have to forget what lies behind us and reach forward to what lies ahead and he says I press on toward the goal to win the Heavenly prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus and he says all of us who are mature amen now maturity speaks of adoption coming up into spiritual adoption all of us who are mature pursuing spiritual Perfection should have this attitude What attitude is this the attitude of leaving those things which are behind and pressing forward to what God wants to do now Paul is saying every mature person or believer should have this attitude and he says brothers and sisters together follow my example and observe those who live by the pattern we gave you amen so Paul is saying amen we we we are striving for this Mark of perfection we know that we have to obtain this but we can't just sit back we have to actively press towards it to obtain the goal to obtain the prize amen amen amen now we find that we you know we we always read the scripture and it's a famous scripture and we might think okay it's just a basic scripture nothing to do with any serious mystery or something like that but amen when you read a scripture like got and then you put it in season then it means something to you amen so we see we are living in a season now where all things are striving to reach their climax Amen in every sphere it's almost like the time where the Prophet was talking about uh when when they were striving to go into space and to to reach the moon everyone was striving to reach the moon first the prophets of Russia was trying to do it America was trying to do it there was this pressure to obtain this goal amen and so now again we can feel this there's this heavy pressure in all spheres Amen in the sphere of Science in the religious sphere in the political sphere there's a huge pressure to reach a climax to reach a goal we see in for example in the sphere of science science has been progressing so much just in the last week we had three big things that have been happening in science one of the Pioneers Elon Musk released three great achievements and one of them being the fully automated driverless cars that the prophet prophesied about the other being a fully humanoid robot and the third thing being for the first time they were able to land back a rocket that they usually send into space usually when they send these Rockets into space the the bottom part of it blows up and they cannot use it again but for the first time they managed to preserve that and they managed to park it back on the ground so in the science there's this huge pressure to obtain and to achieve and to advance and that is what science is doing and so they they've obtained in the last week just these three big achievements then we see in the realm of world wars and and and and what's going on in Israel Israel is trying to achieve that they have this pressure to achieve these three great goal Wars uh War goals there's this huge pressure to win you see there's the war in Russia there's this huge pressure that's building up to win the war and then you look at the political sphere in the USA what's happening there's a huge pressure now for who's going to win the election and you see now both sides they have the red and the blue the Republicans and the Democrats are actively pressing to get votes and to win vote and to win the popular vote they being busy bodies they are going about actively campaigning so that they win the election and you know people are saying that and and it's not just a small group a lot of people are saying that this is actually going to be the most important election for the USA because you say if the Democrats win and if Kamala wins that it might be the end of the Republicans which means if there's the end of that it might be it might mean that's the end of the Constitutional law for the USA because the Democrats are fighting to bring in the Foreigner or allow the foreigners in and the Republicans are saying no we want to stop illegal foreigners from coming into the USA and so by the the Democrats doing that and by allowing the foreigners the foreigners are going to vote for the Democrats and they eventually in each election are going to have the majority and so that will put an end to the Republican having uh any type of uh advantage and you know it's a type of how you know in the spiritual realm all of these there's a huge fight to block out the foreigners from coming into the spiritual amen these demon powers from coming into the body of Christ there's a pressure to stop this just like how Israel is the pressure to stop Hamas from coming into their territory so that's what's happening in the USA and you see they are not sitting back if you look in the last month both uh the Democrat Party and the Republican party has been going widespread campaigning and trying to get the popular vote why they're actively pressing towards something and you know it's it's such an important time because if you look at what the Democrats currently stand for you know they see that they have gone so far left the things that they stand for if they come into power it's going to be a different world as we know it cuz they are allowing all of these gays and lesbians and abortions and all of these things so very soon we're going to see a world Amen that we are not used to a world that does not have any any kind of moral as it is there is no morals so can you imagine if this goes on Amen so there's in the politic and even they recognize it they're not even spiritual but even the Republicans are fighting to say no we can't stand for these things because it's no family values in this so even they can recognize as the world can recognize something is wrong here and they can recognize that there's this huge pressure now to prevent the Democrats from winning yes but we know now that in order for prophecies to be full certain things have to happen it's either the Dem rats win and prophecy is fulfilled the first female president or the Democrats don't win and God is a lotting Grace yeah amen that's right you know so but we know that either way God's word must come to pass am right but these are all just showing that if these are happening in the natural in political sphere in the science sphere and all of these things then in the spiritual there is a pressure to toward something as well there's there's a pressure to achieve something amen you recall Pastor was calling it a A propelling in the spirit realm there's been a a a a quick move of God that's starting to speed up something that has started that is starting to propel and get quicker and quicker and quicker and starting to get more progress gain more ground why there is a pressure Amen to obtain something then you look at the in the in the in the natural world in in terms of natural disasters you're getting all of these disasters that are happening recently we had the hurricane in in Florida in August we had the earthquake in Califor in California yes amen we seen not too long ago a hurricane in in South Africa what is that now that's nature also building up pressure to a point why because before the delivery of the child they must have those huge birth pains and it's given its final birth pains now amen there's a pressure in nature amen because why they are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God Amen and so if all of that is happening then they must be the bride that is also coming into position the bride that is also being propelled Amen to obtain the prize that which Paul was striving for yes Paul was saying I press towards his Mark of perfection amen amen but there's a people now that is striving and is coming to that point of perfect Faith there is a people that is coming to the stature of a perfect man in Christ Jesus amen Paul and and the and On Through the Ages they could preach about it but now is a people that is experiencing it amen a people that is manifesting it and bringing it to pass yes but there's got to be that pressure within us that propels us to excel to these things yeah we cannot sit back now if you look at the Lily the prophet says that the Lily has to go through this process where has to push throughout all the mud yes and it goes through this painful process and it strives to reach up to sunlight and to crack through all of the mud until it comes unto sunlight and when it comes into the sunlight then it can display its glory amen and the prophet says the Christian goes through the same thing he has to go through all of these trials all of the chesan the m and Maya of this world until it can come up into the sunlight amen and then display it Glory yes amen we know Matthew chapter 6 says which of You by taking thought can add one Cupid onto his stature and why take your thoughts for Raymond consider the lies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not a raid like one years the prophet says amen how Mr Lily Pastor Lily is a wonderful School a wonderful Bible teacher he gets down into the valley the dark place he pushed himself through the darkness of the earth so what to do to glorify himself he says no to glorify everything that comes in contact with him amen so the Lily is not trying to glorify Itself by projecting this Glory but it's to glorify those that come come into contact with the Lily amen and he has to toil day and night to keep his Radiance of beauty now watch Jesus said the lily toils not but here the prophet is saying the LI the Lily toils so it's it's the same as when we say the believer has to go through trials and cheses and all of these things and be beaten but at the same time the believer is at rest with the Holy Ghost it's the same like how we say the believer it's not it's not a flowery bed of yeas but at the same time we had rest with the Holy ghost yeah Jesus say no the liily doesn't toil but then the prophet goes and say no but the Lily does toil but it's at rest amen so he says he has to toil day and night to keep his Radiance of beauty to keep the perfume flowing he pulled day and night from the Earth to give out that's what a real Christian does you pray and humble yourself and keep before God day and night in order you in order that you might give yourself to somebody else so why do we have to pray day and night to be a help to somebody else amen amen it's not what you keep it's what you give that counts you must give yourself out to others that's the way Jesus did he gave himself to others did the Bible say in one place behold the lies of the field that's in the Bible what does a lily do he toils day and night just to yield himself to the bees the passer by to give out he saying he's to give out the honey to the bees and you know what does the honey type remember the prophet said one day he was he went to his camp and they had these Bears coming to his camp and he started to tear down his camp and then he saw this baby cup dipping his hand and head and everything into the honey JY and sucking all of the honey and the prophet said when he went back to his mother the mother and the other cup started to suck the honey out of them the prophet types it with the Holy Ghost and revive [Music] so the Lily is producing this honey which is the Holy Ghost and Revival for everyone else to benefit from it amen and that is the bride of Christ is displaying its Glory so that the Revival fires can spread out and that is why we have this year sharing in his glory we are sharing in his glory not only for our own benefit but that we also might share that Glory out to others thank you Lord amen and know now Jesus said that Solomon in all of his glory cannot be compared to one of these why because it's typing the believer now and now Solomon in his day the glory filled a natural Temple the glory didn't fill Solomon it filled a natural Temple amen but now Shak glory is embodied in human temples in human Tabernacles which is a better Glory than that of Solomon amen because that physical Temple was only typing amen the three parts of the temple which was the outer Court the inner court and the most holy of holies was typing us which is the flesh the spirit and the soul and now Shak glory is tabernacl in human flesh and that is why this is a greater glory than that in the days of Solomon amen if you look at the Roman Romans 8 man we know that this is the image that we are coming up to it says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present times are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so what is going to reveal this Glory now it's a pressing a suffering a perseverance that we have to go through is going to reveal this glory amen it's not just us sitting back and expecting God to reveal his glory to us we've got to go through a pressing we got to go through a perseverance amen and that is why nature is waiting nature is expecting this from us amen James Amen in James 1 and: three he said knowing this that the try of your faith worketh patience another translation says knowing that the testing of your faith brings about perseverance he says consider it pure joy my brothers when you encounter Trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance amen allow perseverance to finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything so how are you going to not lack anything you won't be in lack if you go through perseverance because perseverance worketh patience which work which works on your faith and remember patience is a virtue it's long suffering so it's a virtue it's part of the stature of a perfect man amen and that is why Jesus said consider the Lily amen because we have to persevere like that Lily amen amen now Paul is saying in another scripture he saying that he is running this race not aimlessly amen he saying therefore I do not run aimlessly I do not fight like I'm Beaching the air no I discipline my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others I myself will not be disqualified so Paul is saying we are in this race yes but we cannot run aimlessly we got to know what what our destination is amen we got to know what our goal is am me that is why the Bible says that a people without Vision perish you got to have Vision you got to know what you're running towards right amen and you got to be discipline yourself for the race now we take it in the natural we know that in in in the Sports World for example we see all of these athletes and so forth they discipline themselves they bring themselves to rigorous training they do not expect to obtain the prize just anyhow neither neither are they relying on they just on their talent I know if you seen that the these Sports people are very talented but they don't just rely on their talent they don't just come for example to the Olympics rely on their talent but no they get into rigorous training they discipline themselves they do all kinds of things that are not normal to us for example they'll wake up at very early parts of the morning they'll put themselves in these huge ice buckets and freeze themselves almost like to death just to discipline their bodies why because they know in their mind that they have to achieve something and they are determined to achieve something am so just like at the bride of Christ if we are determined to achieve something we are not going to achieve it the way we've been going right we've got to come with a determination we've got to come with a motivation Amen to press Paul says I press actively amen there's got to be something more than what we have been doing to obtain the prize yes now you find even in the uh even in the U in the business world you find very successful people that are determined and these rich billionaires and so forth they don't live the lives that we live you would think hey they are enjoying life they have so much of money they can go on all kinds of holidays and just live their life but no they live actually very stressful lives because they are constantly disciplining themselves they wake up very early in the morning they have all of these structured routines in order to achieve what they achieve yes now many times we talk about them and we say oh they just lasting after money and they doing all of these things but no actually they they have a purpose and a goal in their hearts that they are trying to achieve and they do what is necessary to achieve that and the success follows that the Money Follows that now we on the other hand we say no we want to have this amount of money and we want to drive this car and have this that's the last of money because you are not having the value of working hard for it but you want to last after those things that is the L of money there's no virtue in that but when you are determined to achieve something and you put in the hard work and you discipline yourself then everything else follows you now just like that in the bride of Christ and in the Church of God Amen you say we want to achieve a super race you and achieve all of these Supernatural things you are lasting after those things without putting the effort into obtaining those things and the prophet says power without character is not foot rule it's satanic how does character come would you person persevering with you disciplining yourself with you striving to achieve certain goals and then these signs follow you when you put in the work then all of these things follow you amen but there's this huge pressure Amen to achieve these things it it reminds me of of these black Fridays you know everyone Waits at 12:00 at midnight at the store at the door and there's this huge pressure to get inside reminds me of one one day me and Tyler were standing outside the door where was literally number two in the line and everyone's waiting for midnight for the doors to open to rush in and as soon as the door rushed in we were number two in the line but everyone rushed in before us because there was this huge pressure to get in and that is the determination we need to be having in this hour when time is running out when all things are starting to come to pass and in every sphere amen everyone is coming to the climax there ought to be this HTH pressure in the bride to come up to spiritual maturity amen thank you Lord to fulfill our part of the book amen Paul is talking about a determination to obtain can you imagine how Joshua and Caleb when the spies came back and said no we're not able there's Giants in the land and so forth can you imagine if Joshua and Caleb came with just any old attitude no they had to be determined and say no we are more than able they were determined to achieve it and because of that they were able to go to war and Achieve and obtain The Inheritance but you know that's how it is in the world people are always striving to achieve yes and now we need to take that same kind of motiv motivation and amen applyed down to the things of God you know they have as I was saying the successful people in the world they have their daily routines and so forth sometimes I think we need in in in spiritual terms we need our spiritual routine right amen you'll find that they wake up early parts of the morning they have a certain structure to their day amen we need to start structuring our days to apply the spiritual things of God to give time for the spiritual things of God Amen if you look at for example Daniel Daniel was very successful in the natural leave leave alone the spiritual he is very successful in the natural in fact he was promoted to princes above other princes amen so he he knew how to succeed in the natural and so he applied those same laws in the spiritual of disciplining himself and coming to God three times a day and praying the same laws he applied amen when he needed answers from God he went into fasting and praying and we come back to that but just to say you know when we was looking at these natural people and and achieving things in in in in the business world and in terms of success you might think that they just doing it and achieving but no they actually maybe they don't know it but they actually applying spiritual laws because we know for example the Bible says what you s is what you reap so they apply that maybe they don't know it but they apply it the Bible says give and it will come back to you amen then there's this other step what they which they use is Proverbs 20:3 which says if you love sleep it says love not sleep lest Thou come to Poverty open thine eyes and thou shalt be satisfied with bread so the wisest man on Earth is saying if you want to be wealthy in the natural life don't love sleep get to work because God made Adam to work God said he put Adam to till the ground so these people in the in the world Amen they use these laws they might not know it but they use these laws and they devote all of their time and attention to obtaining these things amen now as I said Daniel was successful both in the natural and the spiritual so he knew how to apply these laws and when he saw that he needed an answer from God he needed to understand the scriptures he went into fasting and praying amen can you imagine he fasted and prayed for 21 days without knowing in the in in the first 20 days or so that he is going to receive anything from the Lord without even getting a whisper or any kind of feedback yes now can you imagine some some of us will never receive a breakthrough because we give up too early there's no perseverance there's no pressing amen towards hearing from God Amen and there's no motivation is sweat it out that Daniel had a sweat it out and he waited until the angel came he continued he as persistent and you know I I I know this this works for a fact amen because I I applied it in my life you know when you know sometimes I I I I be afraid to talk about uh to share spiritual things because you know some some people might not necessarily believe these things you know sometimes the supernatural seems weird or seems hard to believe at times amen especially when the super natural happens amongst us it's hard to recognize when God is moving amongst us it's easy to recognize God somewhere else very easy for example I I'll give you an example before I go into this one of the great Miracles that that we would consider in the Bible for example is raising the dead in the Bible there are hundreds and thousands of Supernatural things that happened the dead was only raised a certain amount of times a few times amen even in Jesus ministry he did so many thousands of Miracles but the dead was only raised perhaps maybe three or four times in his ministry the prophet himself thousands of Supernatural things happened in his life but I think the dead was only raised about four or five times amen so we would classify the dead being raised as a major thing amen we'd count it as a h Supernatural Miracle amen won't you amen but how many of you know that there's a there's a believer he has seated amongst us that has raised the dead how many of you have taken thought that that there's actually someone seated in assembly that has a testimony of the Dead being raised amen why is because sometimes we don't give attention to these things because we can't recognize God moving amongst us amen we can't recognize the presence of God amongst us we want to see God on his throne we want to see God in his Prophet but it's hard to recognize the presence of God amongst us amen because now we say sh glory is Tabernacle human flesh amen so when you look at your neighbor you ought to see God Amen I wrote the song A while back perhaps I should sing it on Sunday I said the the lyrics of the song says I see that you are a child of God adopted son in New Creation after Christ the first born I see a divine nature coming out of you from another dimension amen there's a divine nature being expressed amen inside each of you and if we can only see God in each one of us amen then we can see God move more because by then his presence is recognized amen so I say this to say you know when you sometimes when you give spiritual testimonies there's a you feel that resentment because when you but if you say the prophet did it then it's 100% believed but how would you know if if you was in the days of the Prophet would you have believed him because at that point there was no hype about who the prophet is that's right it's easy now to say yeah I believe the prophet because there's been years of hype built up around him but if you was in the days of the Prophet would you have how would you know would you have believed him if you can believe your brothers and sisters now when they share their Supernatural testimonies yes amen that's how you know you would have believed him then so I said I was talking about Daniel and about how he is fasting and praying and I experienced this you know when when my brother was sick Jonathan who passed on and you know I got into such a state of desperation and you know sometimes it's good even though people might not believe or resent it but it's good to preach out of testimonies because that's what the prophet did right and you rather have someone preach out of an experience than out of an intellectual concept and amen we got men of God here that can preach out of experiences amen Supernatural experiences amen so I got under such desperation at that time because you know um he was getting quite severe and every day I was rushing him to hospital and just to get him on morphine because he was in such pain and all of these things eventually we took him to I left him at the hospital to have his last B of chemo and I began to get so desperate that I said I need to hear from God I I need an answer from God am to the point where at that point Sister Kim was heavily pregnant and you know with pregnancy comes all of these emotions and all of these things but was so desperate that I took her and I left her at her mother's place and I said you stay here I'm only going to pick you up when I hear from God and I went back home I fasted and prayed he went about 3 or 4 days without eating and just waiting upon the Lord not seeing my wife or anything like that despite she being pregnant but that's the desperation I got under because I knew this was a life and death situation and you know it was at that point firstly that when I said God look look God I need to hear from you I'm going to open my bible three times and and the three times that I open my bible I want you to speak to me and give me an answer cuz at that point I didn't know that the Lord was going to take him away and the first time I opened my Bible the Bible says my ways are not your ways my ways are higher than your ways so I said okay I closed my Bible again I opened it again and it says and Jesus Jesus healed every serious pain and that's the first time I read in the Bible where it said Jesus healed every serious pain usually he says Jesus he the sick and all but those words serious pain struck out to me because Jonathan was in such serious pain he needing morphing every day and then I closed it again I opened it again and yah God Was preparing me here now he said thy brother who was once dead is now alive he has once lost now he's saved that was the word of the Lord and I didn't know at that point that he was going to pass on that week but here was God preparing me for it so anyway I was fasting and praying that week and then we ended up getting the call to go to the hospital and passed on and so I was like okay you know I waited upon the Lord I trusted in God but this was clearly God's will because God gave me the scripture for it and his word is absolute so I said praise God so on the day of his funeral uh it was now in the night and I went to lock the gate the outside gate and then I went back to my mom's house and next door my my my brother obviously married my neighbor so my nephew and niece my brother's kids were were next door and I saw my nephew at that point he was much younger I saw him look up to the sky and he's just staring into the sky and so I asked him why why are you staring into the sky it's night time now and then he just ran away inside the house house so I went inside the house and then he sends me from his mother's WhatsApp he sends me a voice note saying that he could see a man in the sky and and the man is threatening to take his life so now I immediately identified this as a demon Spirit now so I said you know what come I want to pray for you you know to cast out that spirit of fear and all of these things but then when he came so I asked him explain to me what you saw and I remember this is a small child and he says I saw this man in the sky and he has dressed like in a robe and he has carrying a sword and so I asked okay where did he come from and he said no this like a window open in the sky and he came from the sky now remember this is a child but he's talking about a portal of a dimension being opened and a spirit coming down amen coming for his life so anyway I prayed for him and I cast out that Spirit right I left him inside the house I went back outside and I was on the phone with brother and we just talking about what happened and I was just sharing to him what happened with my nephew and as I'm talking on the phone I see this light fly across the sky and it disappears in front of my eye and it goes in the direction of where he says this demon Spirit came now for me I immediately identified as the angel of the Lord coming down after praying to combat the enemy so remember now I'm talking about Daniel and a time where he fasted and prayed and the angel came now and remember Michael also came down to fight demon powers when I got under the same desperation I noticed the same thing happened so you know and here comes the re the rebuke even to myself why do we have to wait for a life and death situation for us to get into that desperation why do we have to wait for things like that to happen to experience the supernatural amen it's proof even in Jesus life even in the prophet's life when they were able to separate themselves and and get into such an atmosphere they were able to connect with another realm amen amen and that realm is left there open the angel is there waiting for us to connect with him but the part is on us to actively press amen the part comes on us Amen to do something about it and amen the prophet thought us these laws and that is why the prophet will go into his quiet time you will find that even on the prophet's honeymoon every year he wouldn't even be home would be out in the woods hunting just so he can get away Amen to connect amen amen that is the sacrifice it takes but we say we want the supernatural to operate in our lives and we want to experience the third pole and all of these things but we we don't want it with the sacrifice that it takes now can you imagine Jesus himself had to do this and the problem of it is some of us are too lazy Amen to press towards the mark of the the high calling and it's it's no coincidence because the spirit of the age of Leia amen his laziness is to put us in a lazy atmosphere a lazy attitude a lazy way about doing things amen it's to get us lukewarm that's the spirit of the age amen and one thing God hates is idleness amen amen amen you know if we look at at the first church and in fact when the prophet is talking about the church ages um and you'll read it in the church age book I need to speed up now so we can get into prayer you'll read it in the in the church ages amen the prophet is about to preach the church ages right this is before the seals is open so this is one of the biggest things of his life that he's about to preach and he says before I go into study in the church ages the first thing I did is I went to God in prayer and I sought the Lord and I sought the Lord and only then I went and studied the scriptures see many of us want to just take the quotes immediately and do everything but the prophet said no we waited upon the Lord first to get the inspiration so he says how did I choose the messengers how did I choose the church ages and separate them he said I use the example of the first church and the first messenger and every other messenger had to follow the example of Paul and every other church had to follow the example of the first church amen amen so he said the true Church in this hour will follow the example of the first Ephesian church so if the Ephesian Church were not lazy they went about from house to house breaking bread amen they were continually in prayer in the service of God then the true church in this hour will be doing the same thing the true true church of the will not be lazy will not be idle but will also be doing the same things now we say we're going to write a book of Acts again but look at their dedication look at their determination to press towards the mark of the High Calling yes amen we need to come Amen to that same motivation that same attitude amen then we can experience the power of God moving in the church and that is why amen Malachi says he comes to turn our hearts back Amen to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and remember what the Bible says work with faith it's the perseverance the trials that work with these things amen and we should not be caught up Amen in the spirit of Leia why we are eagles we fly high above the things of this world so we don't have to be caught up in the laziness of latera and how the church world is amen and we are caught up in the dright age we are not stuck in lateria amen amen so we should not be stuck in idleness and laziness amen God hates it amen if you look at the amount of scriptures that God speaks against idleness I'll take you through it very quickly just to give you some examples First Timothy the Bible says besides that they learn to be idlers going about from house to house and not only idlers but also gossips and Busy Bodies saying what they should not Proverbs Chapter 19 slothfulness cast into a deep sleep and an idle person will suffer with with Hunger Ecclesiastes says through slots the roof sinks in and through idleness the house leaks amen we're talking about a spiritual house yeah how is the spiritual house the body of Christ leaking through idleness through laziness proverbs 31 says she looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness Proverbs 13 says the soul of the Slugger craves and gets nothing whilst the soul of the diligently of the diligent is richly supplied 2 Thessalonians 4 even when we were with you we would give you this command if anyone is not willing to work let him not eat amen amen for we hear that some among you walk in idleness not busy at work but busy bodies Proverbs 14 in all toil days profit but mere talk tends only to Poverty amen second Thessalonians now we command you Brothers in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness even he's in the message he's talking about a brother yeah if he's walking in idleness the Bible says keep away from him right amen we we always read this scripture Matthew 20:6 now look at it's the 11th Hour of the day and here comes uh the master and he finds someone standing idle and he says unto him why are you standing idle it's the 11th Hour of the day we know it's typing Le it's typing the 11th Hour workers saying why are you standing idle here is my field going work in my field now it's not that this is just some rich I say just go work in my field as as if he's just giving him a chance the reason why he say go work in my field is because the same Master he saying the Harvest is plenty but the laborers are few amen so he's saying there's so much of harvest but I need labors everyone's Idle No one's working but the Harvest is plenty we see Jesus was a worker he was not Idol even at the age of 12 when he his parents was looking for him Mary was looking for him and they said why are you here we've been looking all along for you he said don't you know must be about my father's business so he was not idle he was not lazy from the age of 12 Years about his father's business amen amen now if we are coming to spiritual maturity how much more now we are not 12 years of age we are coming into spiritual maturity how much more we ought to be about our father's business and that is why you know Jesus even in his own Ministry you know he he went through a whole day ministering and praying for the sick and we know how the prophet said virtue was drained out of him and all of these things now remember Jesus was also human so he suffered from headaches and pressure and tension and all of these things but yet despite working the whole day he would go in the night and pray the whole night amen he was not lazy but he knew he had an objective to achieve and he pressed towards that objective amen amen amen I just want to read before we go into prayer I just want to read this quote before we close Prophet is saying that's the kind of men and woman we need to rise on the scene today if he doesn't answer tonight we will he will tomorrow night if he doesn't answer this year he will next year for he is God Amen not a God but the God and we see him night after night as amam climbed the steps talking about Moses parents now and joset uh would come up to him and say amam dear you've been up here praying all night why don't you just tell some of the boys you working with here to let them pray for a while and am would say well honey what if they don't do it somebody has got to do it somebody has got to pray through that's the way every Christian ought to feel tonight not waiting for somebody else but to take the front ourselves and go through if we believe the Bible to be history it's also a prophetic book that tells us that the same God shall rise in the last days and it's time for him to come on the scene amen so don't leave it for someone else is what the prophet is saying he's saying what if you leave it for someone else and they don't do it we got to take up the front ourselves we got to pray through we got to persevere we got to press onto the mark of the High Calling we got to come into the manifestation of sons of God because what if someone else doesn't who is going to fulfill the scripture we've got to take the responsibility and ourselves to obtain amen and to achieve the stature of a perfect man hallelujah amen let's stand amen even as we get ready to pray so we are what we're going to pray about tonight amen is for God Amen to help us to help the Church of the Living God to get out of idleness to get out of laziness spiritual laziness amen but to pray towards the mark of the ey calling all the things that we are to achieve Amen in this age the bride to be a super race and Invincible Army amen all of these things we want to strive to achieve them amen we want to actively press to achieve them amen but we got to persevere we got to be persistent amen we're not going we're not going to be idle anymore amen we're not going to be lazy amen but God wants to work through a bride who's willing to work amen that is why he said if I can just get one person person fully surrendered amen then God can use him amen then God can move amen God wants people amen God wants workers in the hour because he said the Harvest is plenty but the laborers are few amen why because the laborers have become idle they just standing around in the 11th hour but he but the command is coming the cry is coming out why are you standing idle here is my field go and work in my field hallelujah thank and don't you know if you go and work in the field you will receive the same reward as those that have been working from the very first hour hallelujah oh we worship you Jesus we give you glory Lord Jesus thank you oh God for you have called us in this hour Lord you have called us for such a time
