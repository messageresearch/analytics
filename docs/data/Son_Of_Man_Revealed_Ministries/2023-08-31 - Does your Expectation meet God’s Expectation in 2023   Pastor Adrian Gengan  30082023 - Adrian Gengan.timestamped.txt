[4:52] to Romans chapter 8 verse 23.
[4:55] amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 23 amen
[4:59] just want to speak a little thought
[5:00] because God has an expectation of us

[5:19] messages are turning into questions
[5:21] last week we spoke on do you have the
[5:23] Life of Christ amen
[5:25] does your expectation meet God's
[5:27] expectation in 2023
[5:31] amen

[5:34] amen
[5:35] amen now God's got a high expectation of
[5:38] us
[5:39] it's exceedingly abundantly above all
[5:41] that we can ask to think but I'm asking
[5:44] you what is your expectation does it
[5:47] meet God's expectation in 2023
[5:51] amen so we'll read for you in Romans 8
[5:53] 23 it says
[5:57] now he's talking about people groaning
[5:58] right about creation groaning but he's
[6:01] saying we focus on that a lot and you're
[6:03] saying see creation is groaning see the
[6:04] earthquakes see the tsunamis see the
[6:07] tornadoes
[6:08] see the floods creation is groaning but
[6:12] 23 tells us not only they
[6:17] 23 brings it back to us
[6:21] but ourselves
[6:23] also
[6:25] which have the first fruits of the
[6:27] spirit now who is talking here the
[6:30] apostle
[6:32] Paul
[6:33] now do we have the first fruits
[6:36] or now in the Harvest
[6:39] we in the Harvest so they are the first
[6:41] fruits of the spirit
[6:43] now but we are the Harvest when all the
[6:46] mysteries of God are revealed amen yes
[6:48] the things that they even desire to look
[6:50] into was Kept For Us yes
[6:54] the first fruits of the spirit even we
[6:57] ourselves grow within ourselves waiting
[7:01] for the adoption
[7:03] to wit the Redemption of our body amen
[7:07] amen so this is talking about sons of
[7:10] God recognizing their position
[7:14] amen and it's there in verse 23 that
[7:17] he's telling us that we will no longer
[7:19] focus on what creation is doing yeah
[7:23] on Creations grown alone
[7:26] we can all say hey look at the floods
[7:28] look at the wars look at this
[7:30] creation is groaning the Earth is ready
[7:32] to put forth the birth pain but can you
[7:34] hear the groan within yourself
[7:38] that's what 23 is telling us we
[7:41] ourselves also which have the first
[7:42] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[7:45] grown within ourselves
[7:47] waiting for the adoption to whip the
[7:49] Redemption of our body you may be seated
[7:50] the Lord of blessings to the reading of
[7:52] his word so the next time you hear
[7:54] somebody say look at the signs all
[7:56] around us ask him brother what about the
[7:58] grown within you
[8:00] is there grown within you
[8:03] is there a cry within you
[8:05] amen waiting for the adoption what is
[8:09] your expectation
[8:10] amen creation knows what they are
[8:13] expecting
[8:14] they're expecting sons of God to come
[8:17] back into their full Authority
[8:19] Amen to come into their full
[8:20] manifestation
[8:21] creation is waiting for its master
[8:25] amen hallelujah
[8:29] oh praise the Lord take a minute I'm
[8:31] good on your amens now take a minute and
[8:34] cast off now your flesh amen
[8:37] and listen to what I am saying creation
[8:39] is waiting for its master and you are
[8:43] the master
[8:44] every time you go without speaking to a
[8:46] situation creation is disappointed yeah
[8:50] yeah amen every time you walk away from
[8:52] a situation that is presented to you to
[8:55] display the power and the authority of
[8:56] the almighty God
[8:59] you are not meeting God's expectation
[9:03] amen you are not training yourself
[9:05] you're not using the opportunities yes
[9:08] that God is presenting to you yes amen
[9:11] so we ourselves are groaning within
[9:14] ourselves waiting for the adoption some
[9:16] are not waiting for the adoption
[9:18] some have no expectation but the
[9:21] scripture says we are waiting for the
[9:23] adoption let's put up the scripture we
[9:24] are still on the scripture amen
[9:27] we are waiting for the adoption
[9:30] what is the full adoption the body
[9:31] change
[9:33] amen now
[9:35] was Abraham's retested waiting for his
[9:37] body to change to come back here
[9:42] amen
[9:45] God made him made him wait 25 years
[9:48] waiting for the adoption
[9:52] amen
[9:53] waiting for the adoption until his body
[9:56] would change so that he can produce
[9:59] Isaac the one that was promised amen
[10:02] amen so you and I are waiting now to
[10:04] come back into our original condition
[10:07] and that is the final stage of
[10:09] redemption when we were put on a new
[10:12] body yes amen don't lose focus of that
[10:15] yes don't lose sight of that because
[10:17] that's what is around the corner for us
[10:19] amen amen that's what's on the way for
[10:21] us now here is Jesus in John 10 10 34
[10:26] talking to them they want to Stone Jesus
[10:31] amen they want to Stone Jesus in John 10
[10:35] 34.
[10:37] is it not written in your law
[10:40] I have said you are gods
[10:45] amen John 10 34. amen
[10:48] is it not written in your law I have
[10:51] said you are gods if he called them Gods
[10:54] to whom the word of God came and the
[10:57] scripture cannot be broken
[11:00] then what about the one whom the father
[11:03] Sanctified and sent into the world Amen
[11:08] amen
[11:10] how then can you accuse me of blasphemy
[11:13] for stating I am the son of God
[11:18] amen so God Sanctified
[11:24] amen and he says then how can you accuse
[11:27] me of blasphemy for stating that I am
[11:29] the son of God
[11:30] now we Sons and Daughters of God did
[11:34] Jesus send us into the world Amen go to
[11:36] John 20 there amen John chapter 20 and
[11:40] see if Jesus sent us into the world yes
[11:43] so we are learning that the father sent
[11:45] Jesus amen amen into the world
[11:48] amen
[11:49] and yeah
[11:52] Jesus in John chapter 20 now this is
[11:54] after his resurrection
[11:58] then she said Jesus unto them again
[12:00] peace be unto you as my father has in me
[12:04] even so send I you amen
[12:10] amen amen
[12:13] so as the father sent Jesus
[12:16] Jesus is sending us yes
[12:20] amen and Jesus will not leave us without
[12:24] the power and the authority that he had
[12:27] so he goes on to say here in
[12:31] verse 22 and when he had said this he
[12:34] breathed on them and said unto them
[12:36] receive he the Holy Ghost
[12:42] amen
[12:43] receive he the Holy Ghost
[12:46] amen so you see the requirement when you
[12:49] are sent
[12:52] requirement is the Holy Ghost
[12:55] and that is where people have lost the
[12:58] interest
[12:59] the Holy Ghost
[13:01] amen
[13:03] I'm going to reiterate this because the
[13:05] prophet says here in
[13:07] amen
[13:09] in the message adoption he's talking
[13:11] about the sons of God that are coming on
[13:13] the face of the Earth because that's
[13:14] what we are talking about right sons of
[13:16] God coming back into Dominion Authority
[13:18] he says men that are sons of God are
[13:22] amateur gods
[13:25] amen
[13:27] now you can't be amateur God in power
[13:31] only
[13:33] and then you miss the rest of
[13:36] what Christ was Christ was love
[13:40] Christ had love in his heart amen amen
[13:45] Christ said Peace
[13:47] Christ their Joy the fullness of the
[13:50] Life of Christ
[13:53] amen
[13:55] so he says here
[13:57] men that are sons of God are amateur
[13:59] gods
[14:01] Genesis 2 says they were Gods because
[14:03] they were and full dominion over the
[14:06] Dominion of the world he gave him
[14:08] dominion over some things
[14:14] he gave him dominion over all things
[14:18] and he lost his godship he lost his
[14:20] sonship he lost his domain and Satan
[14:24] took it over
[14:26] so the prophet of God to say that Satan
[14:28] now has the legal right
[14:31] amen
[14:33] but then Christ came and took away that
[14:35] right amen by his sacrifice on the cross
[14:38] Christ took back the Dominion authority
[14:41] of the Earth
[14:43] amen and any comment give it back to us
[14:46] right he says but brother we are waiting
[14:48] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[14:50] who will come back and take it over
[14:52] again
[14:54] amen amen
[14:56] Christ has already done it
[14:58] but the sons of God must be manifested
[15:01] and Christ is waiting amen for Sons and
[15:04] Daughters to rise up to take it over
[15:06] again
[15:10] what he says waiting for the fullness of
[15:13] time
[15:15] when the pyramid gets to the top
[15:18] and we come through seven Church ages
[15:19] yes was it like a pyramid being built up
[15:23] amen so we have come to the top of the
[15:25] pyramid
[15:28] amen
[15:30] when the full sons of God will be
[15:33] manifested
[15:35] when a sons of God manifested at the
[15:37] fullness of time
[15:40] when they get to the top of the pyramid
[15:44] when sons of God will be manifested
[15:47] when the power of God will walk out
[15:50] and take every Power that Satan's got
[15:53] away from him
[15:54] amen the only Power that Satan is
[15:57] walking around with right now is the one
[15:59] you let him have
[16:04] amen
[16:05] praise the Lord we are waiting for the
[16:08] manifestation of the sons of God right I
[16:10] just want to detail this let's go to the
[16:11] next slide here you'll see yes the
[16:13] pyramid we're talking about
[16:15] yo what he's saying waiting for the
[16:17] fullness of time now if you go and do a
[16:19] study on that the fullness of time is
[16:21] when the seventh seal is revealed amen
[16:23] amen as the seventh seal being revealed
[16:25] yes
[16:29] waiting for the fullness of time so that
[16:32] part has been fulfilled
[16:34] the seventh seal has been revealed amen
[16:37] amen amen
[16:38] when the pyramid gets up to the top
[16:40] where are we on the pyramid
[16:43] are we at the bottom
[16:48] I'm trying to make the sport come alive
[16:50] to you amen just make you see it when
[16:52] the pyramid gets to the top yes
[16:56] when the full Suns now as we get to the
[16:58] talk what will happen the full sons of
[17:00] God will be manifested when the power of
[17:03] God will walk out
[17:04] and will take every Power that Satan's
[17:07] got away from him amen yes
[17:11] so what is happening as we get into the
[17:12] top our Revelation is increasing amen
[17:15] amen
[17:16] amen that Revelation is producing a
[17:19] perfect faith
[17:22] amen
[17:23] so
[17:24] we know the prophet says now because we
[17:27] are living in a time where Satan is
[17:29] coming without reasoning again
[17:31] amen from even within the framework of
[17:33] the message
[17:34] trying to destabilize the faith of the
[17:36] people
[17:37] but we we've got to have a experience
[17:40] like Moses had amen amen so no matter
[17:44] how slick the tongue of a man is no
[17:47] matter how many days and chorus arise in
[17:49] this time
[17:51] no matter how much they try to explain
[17:53] that the days of Miracles is passed or
[17:56] what we're expecting was for another day
[17:57] was for another age was for another
[18:00] season that the days of Miracles are
[18:03] over Amen to you it's not over yes
[18:07] amen thank you
[18:11] amen amen to you it's not over
[18:15] yes it's not over because we are waiting
[18:18] for one final healing that's right amen
[18:20] so then how can the days of Miracles be
[18:22] over
[18:23] how can the days of healing be over when
[18:26] the final healing is the healing of
[18:27] these bodies yes
[18:29] hallelujah amen so to me to you who are
[18:32] waiting for the adoption of our own
[18:34] bodies the days of Miracles are not over
[18:37] we shall experience our final Miracle
[18:39] amen
[18:41] yes Lord
[18:43] amen the greatness of all miracles the
[18:46] healing the final healing of this body
[18:48] amen hallelujah we can say that we have
[18:51] been to the back side of the desert we
[18:54] can see we've been called into the
[18:55] presence of God and we found his power
[18:58] that was in the bush search through US
[19:00] yes Lord thank you Jesus
[19:04] amen we have talked to God face to face
[19:07] amen hallelujah and all the devils in
[19:11] the world cannot explain away this word
[19:13] of God to us
[19:15] amen Satan can't do anything with us
[19:18] amen we have passed from death and to
[19:20] life we are born again we are filled
[19:22] with the spirit we are on the sacred
[19:24] grounds right now and the devil can't
[19:26] put one foot in here where we are yes
[19:28] small thank you amen we've got an anchor
[19:31] in our soul and nothing but nobody can
[19:34] ever take its place in there
[19:37] oh yes Lord
[19:39] amen that's a revelation we have of God
[19:41] we have many face to face and we know
[19:43] what we are talking about

[19:48] know the word of God yes amen we must

[19:55] know the word of God Amen we need to

[20:16] word of God

[25:04] needs to be done for what to be United
[25:06] with him
[25:07] now can we not have that and still claim
[25:10] to be United with him
[25:13] how can we not have the Life of Christ
[25:16] when that's his expectation of us
[25:19] and claim to be United with him
[25:22] right then we are fooling ourselves
[25:24] amen this is in order to be United with
[25:27] him they will be one they will be the
[25:29] very manifestation of the word of the
[25:31] Living God now what's Christ the

[25:44] bring this to life the True Vine with
[25:46] the fullness
[25:47] of the spirit and the world
[25:50] now Jesus the prophet of God
[25:53] he's saying the True Vine with the
[25:55] fullness of the word
[25:57] only
[26:00] the True Vine with the fullness of the
[26:02] spirit and the word
[26:05] may do the very acts of power that Jesus
[26:08] did
[26:10] can do the very acts of the power that
[26:12] Jesus did amen amen the True Vine of
[26:16] with the fullness
[26:18] are we the True Vine
[26:20] with the fullness now
[26:23] spirit and word

[26:33] of power that Jesus did amen then as she

[26:42] Jesus will come to death
[26:45] the bride and groove Jesus will come
[26:47] that the bride and groom may be forever
[26:49] United as one
[26:51] you see this word that we have in the
[26:53] end time
[26:54] what does it come to do we are becoming
[26:57] more like him through the word
[26:58] Through the Wood amen through the
[27:00] revelation of the world
[27:02] hallelujah amen we are becoming more and
[27:05] more like Jesus amen the prophet of God
[27:08] says that Christ in the true church is a
[27:12] continuation of the book of Acts what
[27:14] does continuation mean
[27:18] doesn't change just continues
[27:20] amen Christ in the true church is a
[27:24] continuation of the book of Acts
[27:27] amen the book of Acts has not stopped it
[27:30] continues amen amen amen there may have
[27:32] been a disconnect because of unbelief
[27:35] they may have been a disconnect because
[27:37] people never cause a true revelation of
[27:38] who they are amen but the prophet is
[27:41] saying if Christ ever comes into the
[27:42] true church
[27:44] if the anointing ever comes into the
[27:46] true church it'll be a continuation of
[27:48] the book of Acts
[27:52] if they get a true Revelation now this
[27:54] is very important because they
[27:57] when light is in its fullness
[28:01] because remember arise and shine that
[28:03] light has come
[28:05] the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee
[28:08] amen the full sunlight is shining it is
[28:10] the rising of the Sun in the shower
[28:13] and with the rising of the Sun comes the
[28:16] true revelation
[28:17] if they get the true revelation of the
[28:19] two Spirits within the framework of the
[28:21] Christian church now we can't be
[28:24] deceived by that we have the true
[28:26] revelation of the two spirits
[28:29] and by God's spirit that's the Holy
[28:32] Spirit design and withstand the
[28:33] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[28:37] powerless before her
[28:43] amen
[28:44] but what is needed Revelation Revelation
[28:47] produces faith in us
[28:50] and that Faith takes away the power from
[28:53] Satan
[28:56] amen hallelujah because faith is rugged
[28:59] faith is bold yes amen Faith don't care
[29:03] what the enemy says amen Faith knows you
[29:05] to finish work Faith Looks To the Cross
[29:07] and it's a finished work Faith looks to
[29:09] what Jesus Christ has already done
[29:12] yes well
[29:15] thank you you see what does if mean if
[29:19] means that conditions need to be met
[29:22] that if you do this because it does not
[29:25] guarantee that you will get a true
[29:27] Revelation but he's saying if they get
[29:28] it
[29:30] not just any Revelation true Revelation
[29:34] amen amen so what's required Revelation
[29:38] and the Holy Spirit which is God's
[29:40] spirit to discern
[29:42] and withstand
[29:45] the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[29:48] powerless before her
[29:51] how will it be tortured or defeated as
[29:54] when Christ would stood his every effort
[29:56] to gain power over him in the desert and
[29:59] what did God go to the word right
[30:04] Satan hates revelation
[30:06] but we love it with true Revelation in
[30:09] our lives the Gates of Hell cannot
[30:12] Prevail against us but we will prevail
[30:14] over them
[30:17] amen how many of you want to Prevail
[30:19] over the gates of hell
[30:20] amen then say Lord give me the true
[30:23] revelation of your word give me the
[30:24] fullness of the Revelation Lord the
[30:26] Gates of Hell will not Prevail against
[30:28] us that you know is Matthew 16 verse 17.
[30:31] amen when the Lord told Peter the Gates
[30:35] of Hell will not Prevail against this
[30:36] amen hallelujah
[30:39] so the enemy today tries to say the days
[30:42] of Miracles his past there is no such
[30:44] thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:45] this is only emotion it's only work up
[30:48] so the enemy has challenged and his
[30:50] challenge must be met
[30:52] the only way we can meet the challenge
[30:54] of the day
[30:57] amen when denominations call people away
[31:00] and put them in this organization let
[31:02] the woman cut their hair wear makeup and
[31:04] Men of live all kinds of life amen
[31:06] trustees deacons Pastors in the church
[31:08] they get some PhD lld that's a
[31:11] requirement Jesus never did require a
[31:14] man to have that
[31:15] Jesus requirement Jesus expectation is
[31:19] for them to wait in Jerusalem until you
[31:21] endured with power come on Amen then you
[31:25] are witness to me that meets his
[31:28] challenge
[31:30] that meant the enemy's challenge that
[31:33] made it amen in that day it will meet it
[31:36] in this day
[31:37] are you hearing what the prophet is
[31:39] saying
[31:40] what will meet the challenge
[31:42] the Holy Ghost
[31:44] the Holy Ghost in us because the Holy
[31:46] Ghost is the teacher he's the guy amen
[31:49] he takes the word and he brings the amen
[31:51] the word to pass in our lives amen
[31:53] praise the Lord
[31:54] Hallelujah glory to the Lord amen
[31:58] blessed be the name of the Lord
[32:02] just wait for this lights amen
[32:07] that's the name of Jesus Amen
[32:11] Hallelujah
[32:13] [Music]
[32:18] praise the Lord
[32:20] so God's expectation in fact some don't
[32:23] like high expectations
[32:26] but God is very high expectations the
[32:29] Bible says that God's ways are not our
[32:30] ways the Bible says his ways are higher
[32:33] than our ways
[32:34] his thoughts are higher than our
[32:36] thoughts
[32:37] amen so maybe you don't have much of an
[32:40] expectation of you yourself even
[32:43] hmm
[32:44] but why don't you say Lord let me meet
[32:47] your expectation amen and the only way
[32:50] that you will know what God's
[32:52] expectation of you
[32:54] is through the message of the hour
[32:58] amen
[32:59] you go anywhere else they will not tell
[33:01] you what's God's expectation of you
[33:03] they have prayed they are preaching a
[33:05] gospel to make you comfortable in this
[33:07] world
[33:08] amen all they know about is how God's
[33:12] Gonna bless you in this life
[33:13] how God's Gonna Prosper you in this life
[33:16] how are you going to get finances in
[33:18] this life how you're going to get a home
[33:19] in this life how are you going to get a
[33:21] car in this life
[33:23] that's all they can teach you
[33:26] amen but God has an eye expectation he
[33:30] wants us to take back full dominion over
[33:32] the Earth
[33:33] he wants us to have full Authority
[33:35] because where man fell from God has been
[33:38] working
[33:40] God has been laboring
[33:42] amen God has been building up the church
[33:44] to this point amen where Sons and
[33:47] Daughters of God will rise up to their
[33:49] full potential now you may not have that
[33:51] expectation but I want to Burnt an
[33:53] expectation inside of you I want to show
[33:56] that seed of expectation inside of you
[33:58] for you to meet God's challenge of the
[34:00] day
[34:01] thank you thank you amen if you look
[34:04] what's happening there in Revelation
[34:06] chapter six you'll see that all hell
[34:08] unto the fourth seal is on the Earth
[34:13] the Bible says that Hell Followed that
[34:16] horse rider
[34:18] and the horse ride his name is death
[34:21] amen
[34:22] the horse ride his name is death
[34:25] and hell is following him
[34:27] so what you are seeing on the earth now
[34:29] is Hell being full manifested on the
[34:32] earth that's why people have gone insane
[34:34] amen they have gone completely insane
[34:37] you look all around you there's
[34:39] corruption amen moralities are down at
[34:41] an all-time low if maybe there's even no
[34:44] morality amen there's no decency
[34:47] amen it's all over the place we can't
[34:50] claim that we have the Life of Christ
[34:52] and we have the spirit of Christ yet we
[34:54] love Satan's idols
[34:58] we love the things that has put us out
[35:00] there for him to distract you
[35:02] I'm going to be playing here and talk
[35:04] some names because these are his men If
[35:06] You Love Lionel Messi if you love
[35:08] Ronaldo or if you love all of these
[35:10] figures and his images Beyonce and you
[35:13] love all of these worldly figures how
[35:14] can you say you have the love of Christ
[35:16] when you love them
[35:18] they are not God's people but they are
[35:20] your own model
[35:23] you fight for them
[35:25] you'll talk to them
[35:29] you'll secretly go and see the latest
[35:30] fashion the latest style maybe the music
[35:33] whatever it is what are you listening to
[35:35] what are you feeding on
[35:38] we can't go to Satan's distraction Satan
[35:42] has got his people on the Earth and then
[35:44] we look to them
[35:46] and then refreshing after them
[35:49] and then say we have the Life of Christ
[35:51] and we have the spirit of Christ then we
[35:52] try and take the world and bring it into
[35:54] the church
[35:57] God's people are separated people amen
[36:00] those people are peculiar people
[36:02] amen we are supposed to be in Oddball to
[36:04] the world
[36:06] amen amen
[36:08] Hallelujah you find amen even in this
[36:11] day that we are so prideful
[36:14] amen nobody can tell us anything
[36:18] amen
[36:19] praise the Lord some of you need to kill
[36:21] that Spirit within you now and say amen
[36:23] amen amen some of you think some of us
[36:26] think we can do no wrong
[36:28] that our thoughts are perfect
[36:31] but God is presenting trials and
[36:33] situations because he knows he needs to
[36:35] work on your character
[36:36] but every time you let loose amen how
[36:39] does God test your faith by pressure
[36:47] but if you blow up every time God's
[36:49] Gonna keep trying you on that point
[36:53] God's Gonna keep trying you on that
[36:55] point
[36:56] until you bring the Flesh on the
[36:58] subjection amen
[37:00] so if you find yourself constantly
[37:02] flaring up angry for no reason
[37:06] amen always want to be in the right the
[37:09] Bible says why don't you rather take the
[37:11] wrong
[37:12] why don't you pee see when you sing to
[37:15] be like Jesus so Meek and lonely
[37:17] amen
[37:19] praise the Lord but the spirit of God
[37:21] wants to work
[37:23] but we have things that even hinder the
[37:26] spirit of God moving in our own lives we
[37:28] can find maybe we are spending time with
[37:30] the world maybe we were spending time
[37:32] reading the Bible maybe you're spending
[37:34] time praying but we are not conquering
[37:36] other things in our lives
[37:42] Prophet says we need to become prisoners
[37:43] to everything
[37:45] prisoners to Christ
[37:47] and then we forsake everything you know
[37:49] prisoner has very limited rights
[37:51] maybe he has none at all
[37:54] a prisoner goes on what the prison the
[37:57] one that's holding him captive allows
[37:59] him to do
[38:00] so if we are captive to the one who's in
[38:02] our soul the Holy Spirit
[38:05] it's only we do what he allows us to do
[38:08] amen so what how is God molding you and
[38:11] shaping you
[38:12] let me ask you something
[38:16] to meet God's expectation in 2023 what
[38:20] do you need to forsake
[38:23] we just went through some of God's
[38:24] expectation of us as we near The
[38:26] Headstone what is requiring us for us to
[38:29] come into His Image and likeness
[38:31] what is hindering you
[38:34] from reaching God's expectation for your
[38:38] life
[38:39] what do you need to surrender what do we
[38:41] need to surrender
[38:43] what do you do we need to let go of
[38:46] amen
[38:49] I'm sure we all want to grow in the
[38:51] things of God I'm sure we all want to
[38:53] grow up to the headstone
[38:55] but he says in order to be United with
[38:57] him we need to be in His image we need
[38:59] to be the word
[39:00] amen so what is that one little thing
[39:03] that you need to surrender and say Lord
[39:04] help me with this
[39:07] help me with this Lord
[39:10] amen
[39:11] ask yourself even now Lord you know
[39:15] what's your golden witch
[39:18] you know what it's there right now yes
[39:20] because the Holy Spirit Will convict you
[39:22] amen and bring that thing to light yes
[39:25] but if you
[39:26] willing heart is what God is looking for
[39:28] to say Lord I want to surrender this
[39:30] even now in your presence I want to
[39:33] surrender this even now Lord Jesus
[39:35] I
[39:37] I want to shock the devil if I've done
[39:39] somebody wrong I want to say I'm sorry
[39:41] please forgive me
[39:44] if I've done somebody wrong please
[39:45] forgive me if I've said something wrong
[39:48] to offend somebody to hurt them please
[39:50] forgive me yes
[39:52] yes ah it's a hard thing eh because now
[39:54] you're coming against self pride
[39:59] Jesus says love your enemies amen do
[40:01] good to them that hate you yeah do good
[40:03] to them that persecute you and say all
[40:05] matter of things against you you know
[40:07] they said something about the prophet
[40:09] he said there was something remarkable
[40:11] about his character that you couldn't
[40:13] tell you his friends from his enemies
[40:14] yes
[40:17] amen
[40:22] now it sounds like we want to choke
[40:26] and we can't get the words out I am
[40:29] sorry
[40:32] it's so hard to conquer ourselves
[40:35] you know
[40:36] and you won't do anything but
[40:39] make you a child of God
[40:42] to go to somebody and say you know what
[40:43] I was wrong
[40:45] I'm so sorry for doing that please
[40:47] forgive me
[40:50] amen amen
[40:54] amen
[40:55] but the Holy Spirit knows do you know
[40:57] the holy spirit is the design of Hearts
[40:59] amen our thoughts
[41:02] amen
[41:04] now imagine now let me just bring this
[41:06] to a close imagine you get to
[41:09] a time where
[41:11] you can see all things and God is now
[41:14] talking to you and he says you know what
[41:15] you say you miss this blessing here
[41:18] because of this you couldn't forgive you
[41:21] couldn't love yeah
[41:23] and you missed all of it because of this
[41:25] yeah
[41:26] if God could take you beyond the curtain
[41:28] and show you
[41:29] how many blessings along life's journey
[41:31] you missed yes
[41:33] amen and you know sometimes
[41:36] these things come through a genetic line
[41:40] you know the prophet says I'm half
[41:41] Indian I'm this third so he had a temple
[41:43] like a buzzo
[41:46] right
[41:47] how many of you know the prophet says
[41:49] that you remember you want to take his
[41:50] gun and shoot those boys and somebody
[41:53] killed his dog and he took his gun and
[41:54] he just wanted to go after them and
[41:56] shoot them at things
[41:57] amen if we are finding the old nature
[42:00] rising up something is wrong
[42:03] the birth hasn't been proper
[42:06] New Birth
[42:07] if we're finding the old nature
[42:10] amen popping up
[42:12] something is wrong yes we need to go
[42:14] back to the cross
[42:17] where my sin was washed away
[42:20] because at the cross is where the bird
[42:21] starts
[42:22] New Birth amen New Birth coming in amen
[42:26] Lord fill me with your spirit unless you
[42:28] be born of War to the end of spirit amen
[42:31] hallelujah
[42:34] why come so far and leave the little
[42:36] things undone
[42:38] we can have deep Revelation and no deep
[42:42] things but when it comes to the Life of
[42:44] Christ
[42:45] maybe that's even it's in our attitude
[42:48] you know the attitude even to the word
[42:50] of God is very important amen
[42:53] the word of God being preached is the
[42:55] most the prophet says it's the most
[42:56] important thing amen you can while
[42:59] somebody is preaching you can have
[43:01] something in your heart yes
[43:03] do not agree with the brother
[43:06] you be reverent in this presence of God
[43:08] Amen amen you respect the man that is
[43:13] standing behind the pulpit
[43:15] the prophet says many times he says when
[43:18] somebody is preaching he says why don't
[43:21] you eat the chicken and throw away the
[43:23] bones but now Satan comes and walks even
[43:25] there we feel like we know so much we
[43:28] feel like we are highly revelated and we
[43:30] are condemning what the brother is
[43:31] saying while he's preaching
[43:34] the Bible says why don't you have a
[43:36] teachable spirit amen
[43:38] and why don't we say Lord I don't
[43:41] understand maybe things right now but
[43:43] Lord your word is being preached and I'm
[43:45] hearing it and Faith cometh by the
[43:46] hearing of your word
[43:48] amen
[43:49] we should never develop a bad attitude
[43:52] especially now because I tell you why we
[43:56] can create that
[43:58] what's that word
[44:00] Superior ority complex
[44:04] where we feel we are so highly revelated
[44:06] and we look down upon everybody else I'm
[44:09] not talking about denominations now yeah
[44:11] yes amen I'm talking about within the
[44:15] framework of the message
[44:17] because sometimes people can
[44:18] misunderstand this when we are dealing
[44:20] with Spirits we are attacking the spirit
[44:22] and not the people
[44:25] amen
[44:28] sometimes things may be said from here
[44:30] and you will misunderstand what's being
[44:31] said because we are attacking the spirit
[44:33] behind it
[44:34] the lukewarmness the coldness
[44:38] but then now you feel hey we are here
[44:40] and everyone else is not here and then
[44:42] we start to look down upon other people
[44:44] yeah we can't hear anybody else
[44:49] amen there's something wrong
[44:52] there's something wrong you need to
[44:54] check your experience now you need to
[44:56] check your experience
[44:59] Hallelujah
[45:00] amen praise the Lord so God has an
[45:03] expectation for us in 2023 are we
[45:05] meeting God's expectation
[45:08] amen are we meeting God's expectation
[45:10] have we come up
[45:12] and we come up
[45:14] by The Headstone
[45:17] amen now I don't I
[45:21] half these things you know I was not
[45:23] planning to say my message was something
[45:24] different but the Holy Spirit has now
[45:27] shown a spotlight into each and every
[45:28] one of us
[45:30] we all know what that thing is
[45:33] and even now
[45:35] amen you need to make it right before
[45:37] the Lord
[45:39] amen hallelujah and if that person is
[45:42] still alive
[45:44] you have the opportunity
[45:46] because the prophet says well the Bible
[45:47] even says you go to that person
[45:51] and you make it right
[45:56] it's no longer I that liveth but Christ
[45:58] that liveth in me
[46:01] you make it right
[46:04] you still got the breath of life but the
[46:06] Joshua is telling me today about
[46:07] somebody that what's he 42
[46:13] 42 went to bed last night
[46:17] how many months old is a baby
[46:20] four months old so the mother is
[46:21] sleeping with the baby in the other room
[46:23] she comes this morning
[46:25] to wake him up
[46:27] he doesn't wake up
[46:31] he's gone at 42. in his sleep
[46:36] how do you know when you will go
[46:40] amen
[46:41] don't put off for today
[46:44] what you can do and fix today
[46:47] don't wait for tomorrow because tomorrow
[46:50] may never come
[46:52] amen if you wait for tomorrow you may
[46:55] wake up in another place in another
[46:57] dimension
[46:59] amen like that remember that Christian
[47:01] ruler when you woke up one day
[47:04] he saw you were separated far from
[47:06] Father Abraham
[47:09] and he could do nothing
[47:12] to go back to the Earth do you know how
[47:15] many millions of people reality in
[47:17] another dimension that could wish for
[47:19] one opportunity to come back to the
[47:21] Earth
[47:22] just one opportunity
[47:24] or do you know how many of them wish
[47:27] they could send somebody back to one
[47:29] their loved ones
[47:31] but they'll never have that opportunity
[47:33] but you and I in the land of the living
[47:36] where Redemption is stood here the only
[47:38] time you can do something about it is
[47:40] you're on this Earth
[47:44] if the Lord takes you away
[47:47] that you can't do anything about it
[47:49] neither can your loved ones do who's on
[47:52] the earth now go and pray
[47:54] like Purgatory get you out of purgatory
[47:56] do Penance do all of these things pray
[47:59] to this saint they can't do anything for
[48:01] you
[48:03] so today if you hear his voice
[48:05] why don't we make those things right
[48:07] amen amen amen
[48:09] Hallelujah yes why don't we make it
[48:12] right and say you know what
[48:15] Lord Holy Spirit I hear what you are
[48:18] saying
[48:19] and I'm a Child of God I'm a Son of God
[48:21] I'm a daughter of God
[48:23] and I want to be obedient to the spirit
[48:27] I don't know if you know that's as good
[48:28] as power
[48:31] because power without the character is
[48:35] satanic
[48:39] but the problem goes on to say that
[48:42] power with character is fit to rule his
[48:46] foot to have dominion
[48:48] so we need to have the boat in place
[48:50] amen Jesus didn't operate in that level
[48:53] of power without the character
[48:55] he had the character
[48:57] Hallelujah let's all Stand Together amen
[49:00] let's just bow our heads Close Our Eyes
[49:01] amen praise the Lord thank you
[49:05] praise the Lord amen
[49:12] amen
[49:13] does your expectation meet God's
[49:15] expectation in 2023
[49:18] amen
[49:22] Hallelujah
[49:24] eight months have passed we are coming
[49:25] into the ninth month of the year
[49:29] amen
[49:31] the Lord has been working on us
[49:33] the Lord has been molding us shaping us
[49:36] but what have we been holding back what
[49:39] have we're not being surrendering to the
[49:41] Holy Spirit
[49:42] amen the holy spirit in US makes Satan
[49:45] powerless the holy spirit in US defeats
[49:48] the enemy it takes the word amen
[49:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[49:52] amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen
[49:57] praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen
[50:01] praise the Lord Glory hallelujah amen
[50:05] let's turn it off praise the Lord
[50:07] hallelujah thank you Jesus he's worthy
[50:10] of praise
