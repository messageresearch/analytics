[3:25] shine the work of the enemy we ask His
[3:28] blessings in the name of our Lord and
[3:30] Jesus Christ with much
[3:32] Thanksgiving
[3:34] amen amen I greet you all in the
[3:36] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[3:38] Jesus Christ amen turn around greet
[3:40] somebody welcome them in the house of
[3:42] the Lord amen say good to see you praise
[3:45] the Lord
[3:47] [Music]
[3:52] amen bless the name of Jesus
[4:04] amen so we'll turn to our Bibles in 2
[4:07] Corinthians chapter 13 and verse
[4:11] 1 amen we're going to continue
[4:14] our message amen a three-dimensional
[4:17] being Faith open charity the essence of
[4:21] Love we'll go into Peter James and John
[4:24] this morning amen a three-dimensional
[4:26] being Faith to open charity which is the
[4:29] essence of love Peter James and John
[4:33] amen so 2 Corinthians 13 and verse1
[4:39] says in the mouth of two or three
[4:42] Witnesses shall every word be
[4:46] established so if God's going to
[4:48] establish something on the earth he's
[4:49] going to do it in the mouth of two or
[4:51] three Witnesses amen and in 1
[4:54] Corinthians chap
[4:56] 13:13 praise the Lord
[5:04] it says and now abided faith hope
[5:07] charity these
[5:09] three so these are the three Witnesses
[5:11] we are talking about amen but the
[5:14] greatest of these is Charity amen is
[5:18] love amen the Lord had blessings to the
[5:20] reading of his word you may be
[5:22] seated amen so we going to continue
[5:24] we're going to try not to repeat amen
[5:26] things we said last week amen but if the
[5:29] spirit gives utterance we will obey the
[5:31] voice of the spirit this morning so if
[5:33] we get our first quote just to establish
[5:34] what the prophet is saying faith hope
[5:37] and charity these three but the greatest
[5:40] of these is love now he says faith open
[5:43] charity not three different
[5:45] things but all the essence of one and he
[5:49] says it is love amen
[5:54] hallelujah so I want to remind you why
[5:56] we are speaking these things because
[5:58] this is the image that we we are coming
[6:00] to a three-dimensional man that consists
[6:03] of faith hope and charity amen amen and
[6:06] it is one kept off by Love So within the
[6:09] Capstone of love which is coming over
[6:11] the believer now you are going to find
[6:13] all of these elements you're going to
[6:15] find these three
[6:17] Witnesses amen because this is the
[6:19] perfect man this is the man that's going
[6:22] in the Rapture amen amen I if you're
[6:24] looking for that man going in the
[6:26] Rapture that it's us amen praise the
[6:28] Lord so we know that we are
[6:30] three-dimensional being and we are body
[6:32] which is the flesh the soul the spirit
[6:35] and then the Soul amen I don't if you
[6:37] can say Amen to that you know amen that
[6:39] you're a flesh being amen but you're not
[6:41] controlled by the flesh you walk after
[6:44] the spirit and within your soul lies the
[6:46] gene of God so we are three-dimensional
[6:49] being and we can say it this way that
[6:51] hope is the
[6:52] flesh amen faith is the spirit realm and
[6:57] love is in the soul Realm hallelujah
[7:00] amen in St John 11:21 you'll find there
[7:03] how hope is operating amen praise the
[7:07] Lord you'll see faith in the spirit
[7:09] realm in Romans 8 And1 and you'll see
[7:12] Love is in the soul amen now we know
[7:15] that we were made in the image of God
[7:16] according to Genesis 1: 2627 can you say
[7:20] Amen to that we were made in the image
[7:22] of God but we know that God is love so
[7:26] if God made us in His image then we are
[7:28] love amen yeah our image is also love
[7:32] amen because God's image is his nature
[7:34] his character his essence of his being
[7:37] so if God is love then his bride must be
[7:39] love
[7:41] amen amen with this little quote we're
[7:45] going to see the difference between
[7:46] faith hope and love before we continue
[7:48] amen because we want to establish what
[7:51] the prophet is saying and how he's
[7:52] saying it so that we are not caught
[7:54] unawares we are not caught operating in
[7:57] faith without hope and love or we are
[7:59] not caught operating with a hope amen
[8:01] that is hopeless or we are not caught in
[8:03] faith without love the prophet says
[8:05] that's
[8:07] dangerous let's see what he says now he
[8:09] says now Faith is burning how I like to
[8:12] think of faith hope faith charity those
[8:15] three things hope what a beautiful thing
[8:18] hope is little timid hope lovely and
[8:21] sweet as she is yet she's the greatest
[8:24] enemy faith
[8:25] has right if you remain in Hope only
[8:29] it's an
[8:31] enemy he says the greatest enemy Faith
[8:34] got is Hope cuz a person becomes so
[8:36] hopeful till they leave away from
[8:39] Faith praise the Lord amen now hope will
[8:43] agree with the Bible hope will say it's
[8:45] true hope will say I believe every bit
[8:48] of it so hope believes the word amen
[8:51] hope believes the word of God I believe
[8:55] that's the word of God and I believe
[8:56] that God will keep his promise hope
[8:58] believes all of them that but then op
[9:00] says now believe that God will heal the
[9:02] sick but look at my
[9:05] condition now just to show you that
[9:07] point in the Bible let's go to amen uh
[9:10] John 11 there quickly and 21 I want to
[9:14] show you how op
[9:16] poates let's look at a Bible example
[9:20] amen now watch Jesus is coming and watch
[9:23] how hope
[9:25] speaks then then said Martha unto Jesus
[9:28] Lord if thou Hast been here my brother
[9:31] had not
[9:33] died
[9:36] Hallelujah now watch she's talking if
[9:39] you had been here now remember what
[9:41] prophet says the devil tries to do he
[9:44] keeps you focused on a Time Gone
[9:46] by or it keep you looking into the
[9:49] future but it fail to show you what God
[9:52] is doing present tense and you see the
[9:55] example right here she's trying to say
[9:57] if you had been here in the past when he
[9:59] was still alive my brother wouldn't have
[10:02] died right so you're seeing this is our
[10:05] hope speaks
[10:06] now next verse but I know that even now
[10:10] whatsoever thou will ask of God God will
[10:12] give it thee let's continue amen Jesus
[10:15] said unto her thy brother shall rise
[10:18] again amen Mara says now watch he's
[10:22] going to go into future tense now she
[10:24] just spoke about the past she says I
[10:26] know that he shall
[10:28] rise again in the resurrection at the
[10:30] last day so hope looks to either the
[10:33] past or it'll look to a future event but
[10:35] never focus on the present but Jesus is
[10:38] going to pull her into a present tense
[10:40] reality yes thank you Lord amen Jesus
[10:44] said unto her I am the resurrection and
[10:47] the life he that believeth in me though
[10:49] he were dead yet shall he live I want
[10:52] you to know this morning if you have a
[10:53] dead circumstance if you have a problem
[10:56] a sickness a disease whatsoever you're
[10:57] going through right now amen Jesus
[11:00] Christ says I am the resurrection and
[11:02] the life amen he can bring your de
[11:04] situation back to life oh yes thank
[11:07] you so Jesus is correcting a teaching
[11:10] and he's bringing hope into
[11:13] Faith so I'm just trying to show you an
[11:15] example of somebody being under Hope but
[11:18] they not expecting to see Faith now
[11:21] because Hebrews 11 says now Faith I like
[11:25] a man who believes and has a now Faith
[11:27] oh yes Lord not looking at tomorrow but
[11:30] e now
[11:32] fa praise the
[11:34] Lord amen I think it's uh 32 if you go
[11:38] to 32 watch when Martha comes along what
[11:40] she says
[11:41] now
[11:43] amen then Mary when she was come where
[11:46] sorry Mary Mara goes to call Mary watch
[11:49] Mary also is in Hope then when Mary was
[11:51] come where Jesus was and saw him she
[11:53] fell down at his feet saying unto him
[11:55] Lord if thou H has been here my brother
[11:57] had not died so he can see both Martha
[12:00] and Mary are operating in Hope because
[12:03] their brother is
[12:04] dead wonder I don't care how dead your
[12:07] situation is
[12:09] amen amen don't operate under hope when
[12:13] the present tense word is here now that
[12:15] was Jesus present tense there I'm saying
[12:18] we are the word made flesh now the word
[12:20] present tense is here now so there
[12:22] should be no dead
[12:24] situation there must be a resurrection
[12:26] and there shall be a resurrection
[12:29] let's continue amen that was just the
[12:31] example we wanted to show you in the
[12:32] Bible amen now Faith don't look at that
[12:35] faith comes around I don't care nothing
[12:38] about conditions I don't care about a
[12:39] dead Lazarus in a
[12:41] tomb I don't care about your zero bank
[12:44] balance I don't care about the doctor's
[12:46] report about your sickness or your
[12:48] illness I don't care about your past
[12:50] amen don't care nothing about the
[12:52] conditions God said so and it's
[12:55] mine you see F Burley and I once said
[12:59] faith has hair on the chest so this is
[13:01] not a boy boys don't have hair on the
[13:05] chest this is a man this is a mature son
[13:09] and daughter of God praise the Lord when
[13:12] it stands up and pulls its big muscles
[13:14] out everything else vanishes away am
[13:17] just flies away when Faith really takes
[13:20] a hold nothing else
[13:22] stands see you've got to have hope I'm
[13:26] telling you Faith but you've got to have
[13:28] hope and ch ity now watch what he says
[13:31] if you've got really Bly faith and no
[13:33] love with it you'll ruin your influence
[13:36] before the
[13:37] [Music]
[13:38] people if you haven't got love mixed
[13:41] with it you know sometimes people
[13:43] operate in so low levels of faith that
[13:45] you think they've been so long in the
[13:46] church so long in the message you just
[13:48] want to go there and shake them up a
[13:51] bit but he says now if you do that
[13:54] without
[13:55] love you're going to ruin your influence
[13:58] before the people
[14:00] so everything must be done with love
[14:03] praise the
[14:06] Lord he says You' seen people a really
[14:10] Bly what we would say excuse the
[14:13] expression a bulldog Faith to grab a
[14:17] hold but it's so rough with
[14:19] it then you see when you do that it
[14:22] hasn't got the kindness here to move
[14:25] with it that is why the fivefold
[14:26] ministry must operate together amen the
[14:29] prophet says the Evangelist will come
[14:31] and shake things
[14:33] up the ax will be laid to the root but
[14:36] he says now the shepherd comes and he
[14:38] pours that bomb over it amen he tries to
[14:41] pour that bomb over the wounds amen of
[14:43] the people
[14:45] hallelujah but that's why they've got to
[14:47] work
[14:49] together then you see when you do that
[14:51] it hasn't got any kindness yet to move
[14:53] with it so what we need now watch after
[14:55] saying all of that the prophet is saying
[14:57] this so what we need is Hope
[14:59] Faith
[15:01] charity hope faith charity together pay
[15:06] attention to this now God help our
[15:08] church to have it like that the people
[15:11] to have that
[15:13] combination amen so we need to say as a
[15:16] church now we want to have that
[15:18] combination Even in our own lives we
[15:20] want to have the combination of faith
[15:23] hope and love amen praise the Lord
[15:29] now when Jesus chose 12 disciples there
[15:32] are only three disciples that he changed
[15:34] their
[15:35] name he gave them new names amen you can
[15:39] you can read that in the Bible amen
[15:41] hallelujah uh you find the verses there
[15:44] you can find Amen in many chapters
[15:46] you'll find where Jesus changed Simon to
[15:48] Peter yes
[15:51] hallelujah amen he changes Simon to
[15:54] Peter and
[15:57] then he changes the names of the
[16:00] brothers of James and
[16:03] John and he gives them the surname
[16:06] bonus which means sons of thunder
[16:10] amen hallelujah amen they were the sons
[16:14] of
[16:15] zebede but when Jesus sees them he says
[16:19] you are the sons of
[16:21] thunder this is James and John praise
[16:24] the
[16:26] Lord you find that in mark 317 you'll
[16:29] see there Jesus changes the names of the
[16:32] brothers James and John and he surnames
[16:34] them Bonas which means sons of thunder
[16:37] now watch these three
[16:39] men because they are typing what we are
[16:41] speaking about now you won't find this
[16:44] in the nominal Church World it takes the
[16:47] prophetic eye amen of the scripture to
[16:50] now identify faith hope and charity and
[16:54] give them names amen wonderful so he
[16:58] takes Peter J and John Jesus called
[17:00] these
[17:01] men and you'll notice at significant
[17:04] times in his journey amen through he
[17:07] takes only these three men he takes
[17:09] Peter James and John amen and we know
[17:12] that God doesn't do anything without a
[17:14] purpose he is establishing a thing
[17:17] didn't we say in the beginning there out
[17:19] of two or three Witnesses he will
[17:21] establish it amen
[17:25] l so the prophet is revealing the reason
[17:29] and that's what we're looking at this
[17:30] morning the reason why he chose Peter
[17:32] James and John because this was the
[17:35] Invincible Army Faith open charity is
[17:38] the god
[17:39] man and Jesus knew this and he took them
[17:42] aside when were whenever he was
[17:44] requiring perfect
[17:46] Faith or you was trying to establish
[17:48] something on the earth or it was an
[17:50] important
[17:52] event praise the
[17:54] [Music]
[17:56] Lord Now watch how he says it
[17:59] he says and this is just a little thing
[18:01] on the side but it always appeared to me
[18:05] that Peter represented
[18:08] Faith James
[18:11] hope and John
[18:14] charity hope faith charity what he says
[18:18] God's Earthly
[18:21] witness so if we are saying we Are
[18:23] Witnesses of God we need to possess all
[18:26] three of these Essences amen faith hope
[18:29] and
[18:30] charity now doesn't it seem like hope
[18:33] sounds a bit negative but you've got to
[18:36] have
[18:38] hope my hope is built on nothing less
[18:41] but Jesus blood and righteousness amen
[18:44] Now watch how Jesus so beautifully does
[18:47] it he sandwiches hope in between faith
[18:50] and love to keep it in
[18:52] check whenever it is mentioned in the
[18:55] bible it's mentioned faith hope and
[18:57] charity and when whenever it's mentioned
[18:59] about Peter James and John James is
[19:02] always sandwiched in between those two
[19:05] to keep it in
[19:07] check amen wonderful
[19:10] Hallelujah so we said these are God's
[19:12] Earthly Witnesses and brother brandham
[19:14] also calls it God's Representatives on
[19:17] the earth Faith open charity he says and
[19:19] look at at Peter when he was walking by
[19:22] while he was Mortal he was born of
[19:24] sinful flesh just like you and I that's
[19:27] right
[19:29] but the people had need of a Healer and
[19:32] the people laid in Peter's Shadow and
[19:34] were healed God sent Peter to do a
[19:36] specific work
[19:38] amen he says Hope was in James he was
[19:42] the one to set the church in
[19:44] order Faith was in Peter and charity was
[19:48] in
[19:49] John hope faith and charity it was God's
[19:53] Representatives on the earth amen amen
[19:57] amen remember you're speaking these
[19:59] things because these things must abide
[20:01] and abound in
[20:02] you praise the
[20:05] Lord and then he goes on to say that
[20:07] John was love he says Peter didn't have
[20:10] the love in his heart that John
[20:12] had Hallelujah you're reading this Peter
[20:16] didn't have the love in his heart that
[20:18] John had John was God's agency of
[20:21] love now before we continue further I
[20:24] want you to know that John is a type of
[20:26] the Bride John is a type of an end time
[20:28] people and we are God's agency of love
[20:32] amen amen I I also want to declare that
[20:35] the world can't afford to miss
[20:39] John sir Amen in the agency of Love
[20:42] Comes John 3:16 for God so loved the
[20:45] world that he gave his only begotten son
[20:47] that whosoever believeth on him should
[20:49] not perish but have everlasting life it
[20:52] is found in the Book of John hallelujah
[20:55] amen so the world can't afford to miss
[20:57] John in this hour or Miss love in this
[21:00] hour or miss the bride in this hour
[21:02] because John is going to go in the
[21:04] Rapture the only Bible the only Grace
[21:07] the only love the only hope that the
[21:09] world will see is through the John
[21:11] ministry that's right is through the
[21:13] bright Ministry on the earth now amen
[21:15] John love is on the earth now amen you
[21:18] and I represent John on the earth now
[21:20] yes we are representing love on the
[21:22] earth now and I tell you this love amen
[21:25] is a super love it's a super anointing
[21:27] come upon the belie Bel amen so God
[21:30] could have chosen Peter which is Faith
[21:32] to be on the aisle of Patmos he could
[21:34] have chosen James which is hope to be on
[21:36] the aisle of Patmos but God chose John
[21:39] to receive the Revelation on the aisle
[21:41] of Patmos
[21:43] hallelujah thank you Lord praise the
[21:45] Lord John we said again he's the type of
[21:48] the Bride so John which is the love
[21:50] Ministry is prophesying again so John is
[21:54] kept with all seven
[21:56] virtues I was expecting a better amen
[21:59] than that this bride is kept with all
[22:01] seven virtues amen she is lacking
[22:04] nothing because the Bible says if we
[22:06] lack anything we will be Barren and
[22:08] unfruitful but this bride can't be in

[24:43] [Music]
[24:44] principles they may have been operating
[24:46] with faith
[24:49] alone but charity only comes at the end
[24:52] time the Capstone arise and shine for
[24:55] thy light has come he's only coming in
[24:57] Revelation 10
[24:59] amen praise the
[25:02] Lord
[25:05] hallelujah let's go to Luke
[25:08] 8:51 amen remember now we got to read
[25:11] the Bible because a lot of people don't
[25:12] read their Bibles so at least when you
[25:15] come to church you're reading a good
[25:16] dose of your Bible amen praise the Lord
[25:19] Luke
[25:23] 8:51 and when he came into the house he
[25:25] suffered no now this is now jerus
[25:29] Jus comes to Jesus and he ask Jesus to

[25:34] house by the time they get to the house
[25:36] you know on the way somebody came with a
[25:39] message that your daughter is already
[25:43] dead now let's operate principles if
[25:46] you're calling us to pray at your home
[25:48] and there's unbelievers there and we we
[25:50] tell them to please leave the room
[25:51] please don't get
[25:53] offended or if you called us and you
[25:56] know what time we're coming you should

[26:00] right amen praise the
[26:02] Lord amen yes
[26:06] amen the kingdom of of Heaven has
[26:09] principles it has

[26:13] suffered no man to go in save Peter
[26:16] James and John there it is again amen
[26:20] faith hope and
[26:21] charity and the father and the mother of

[26:25] maiden and all wept and bewailed but he
[26:28] said weep not she is dead she's not dead
[26:31] but
[26:32] sleepeth and they laughed into scor
[26:34] knowing that she was dead and he put
[26:37] them all
[26:42] out so when we speak a word over your
[26:46] life and we say it is
[26:49] finished if there are thoughts coming
[26:51] through your head scorning and laughing
[26:53] cast it out immediately

[27:05] quiet but I'm going to hold to God's
[27:08] word
[27:09] amen and he put them all out and he took
[27:13] her by the hand and called saying maid
[27:16] arise and a Spirit came again and she
[27:20] arose straightway and he commanded to
[27:22] give her
[27:25] meat praise the Lord thank let's just
[27:28] jump to Revelation 10 the bride was
[27:33] dead what you are witnessing in
[27:35] Revelation 10 is the resurrection of the
[27:37] Bride of Jesus Christ after the
[27:39] prophetic gift of Revelation 10:7 the
[27:41] bride comes back to life amen she awakes
[27:44] at the Midnight Cry and that's why he
[27:46] says take the book and eat you've got to
[27:49] eat amen when your strength comes back
[27:51] to the body and the bride is awakened
[27:53] that's why he says what a resurrection
[27:55] that was but what a resurrection this is
[27:58] to be quickened from the dead amen so in
[28:01] Revelation 10 the bride is awakened can
[28:04] these red bones live again son of man
[28:06] prophesy to these Dry Bones amen
[28:09] hallelujah so the bride was awakened and
[28:11] quickened and when she awakened give her
[28:14] something to eat oh yes praise the
[28:19] Lord thank you Lord the prophet now
[28:22] elaborates on this he says he walked
[28:23] into the house where all that was at he
[28:26] how could he ever do anything when when
[28:28] that kind of unbelief was he said every
[28:30] one of you get out put them out of the
[28:32] house get going every one of you doubt
[28:35] fear anxiety get out he was wondering
[28:38] who had Faith he said Peter James and
[28:40] John oh Faith oh charity come here
[28:45] that's what he has to have you see what
[28:47] happens if you want to see the
[28:48] resurrection of the
[28:50] Dead what is the prophet saying that's
[28:53] what he has to
[28:55] have we kind have people going into a SI
[28:58] room with no hope and they're trying to
[29:00] operate there no open the scriptures no
[29:02] open the word they no have no knowledge
[29:04] of the word and they're trying to
[29:06] operate maybe out of traditional
[29:08] religion they're just praying over
[29:11] situations amen maybe even in the prayer
[29:14] line people walk in and walk
[29:16] out no faith to
[29:19] exercise amen he says that's what he has
[29:22] to have bring them in
[29:25] amen praise the Lord so what do it mean
[29:28] when he say bring them in meaning if you
[29:30] don't have it bring it
[29:32] in if you have faith without love bring
[29:35] in Hope amen if you have faith and love
[29:37] bring in hope if you have amen hope and
[29:40] and love bring in faith amen or if you
[29:42] have Faith and Hope bringing love he
[29:44] says it's got to have this combination
[29:50] amen he walked over there and all on the
[29:53] outside of that wall was unbelief so he
[29:55] was empowered with the spirit so he
[29:57] could speak speak in unknown
[29:59] towns praise the Lord that's the prophet
[30:01] of God now amen in Jus and Divine
[30:04] Healing
[30:06] glory amen
[30:08] amen let's go to Luke chapter 28
[30:23] 928 and it came to pass about in eight
[30:26] days after these Saints he took
[30:30] Peter John and James and went up into a
[30:33] mountain to
[30:40] pray hallelujah
[30:43] amen so notice how prayer should be
[30:46] approached you've got to take faith hope
[30:48] and
[30:49] charity
[30:52] Hallelujah and he prayed the fashion of
[30:55] his and as he prayed the fashion of his
[30:57] count was altered and his reignment was
[31:00] white and
[31:04] glistening and behold so when Glory
[31:07] comes upon you it changes your outer
[31:09] garments even remember when the glory
[31:11] Came Upon
[31:14] Moses and we are saying the glory of the
[31:16] Lord is returning to his church amen
[31:20] amenah so expect to see a change of
[31:22] countenance expect to see a change of
[31:25] reignment Glory
[31:28] and behold they talked with him two men
[31:31] which were Moses and Elias who appeared
[31:34] in glory and spake of his of his decreas
[31:39] which he should accomplish at
[31:42] Jerusalem sorry spoke of his decease
[31:45] which he should accomplish at Jerusalem
[31:47] but Peter and they that were with him
[31:50] were heavy with sleep and when they
[31:53] awake they saw his glory so your faith
[31:56] can go to sleep
[31:59] that's right in the midst of the
[32:00] supernatural your faith can go to
[32:04] sleep right now who else did he take
[32:06] with him James and John the Bible is
[32:10] saying here Peter and they that were
[32:12] with him were heavy with
[32:15] sleep and when they were awake they saw
[32:17] his glory and the two men that stood
[32:20] with
[32:21] him and it came to pass as they departed
[32:24] from him Peter said unto Jesus Master it
[32:28] is good for us to be here and let us
[32:30] make three Tabernacles one for thee one
[32:33] for Moses one for Elias not knowing what
[32:36] he
[32:37] said while he thus speak there came a
[32:41] cloud and overshadowed
[32:44] them praise the Lord
[32:47] amen and they feared as they entered
[32:51] into the
[32:52] cloud so people who don't believe this
[32:54] Cloud have not entered into the cloud
[32:57] amen praise the Lord amen yes what is
[33:01] that Jesus adoption ceremony everybody
[33:04] agreed that was Jesus adoption
[33:07] ceremony now if the groom got adopted
[33:10] and had an adoption ceremony and there
[33:12] was a cloud that came down and they
[33:13] entered into the cloud for the bride's
[33:16] adoption ceremony which is in Revelation
[33:18] 10 there's got to be a cloud and there's
[33:20] got to be a people who enter into the
[33:23] cloud amen who enter into that
[33:26] revelation we are swept up into the
[33:28] Revelation what was the cloud seven
[33:31] angels formed that cloud the prophet
[33:33] says night after night an angel came to
[33:35] me in the room and gave me the
[33:36] revelation of that seal
[33:39] yes so when we receive the revelation of
[33:42] the word we are entering the
[33:45] cloud
[33:50] glory and they came a voice out of the
[33:52] cloud saying this is my beloved Son hear
[33:56] him amen praise the Lord now I want you
[34:00] to
[34:01] remember in Revelation 101 it's saying
[34:05] that they came from Heaven you can put
[34:06] it up there was a mighty Angel who
[34:09] descended from Heaven clothed with a
[34:10] cloud yes amen right a rainbow over his
[34:15] head I want you to know that picture
[34:17] didn't change when John is going to the
[34:20] Angel's
[34:24] hand everybody understand amen he's
[34:27] close clth with a cloud so when John is
[34:29] going to this Angel this Angel is still
[34:31] clothed with a
[34:32] cloud a rainbow about his head everybody
[34:36] understanding the
[34:37] picture
[34:39] amen so I'm trying to show you here that
[34:42] amen what happened to Jesus happens to
[34:45] the bride the bride has got to be
[34:46] adopted let's see what the prophet of
[34:48] God says
[34:49] now and then the son after he's talking
[34:52] about a son under tutors I just want to
[34:54] tell you that he's talking about
[34:55] adoption and then the son after he come
[34:57] out there was given no longer was he
[35:00] just like a servant and tutor he was the
[35:03] boss I I pray we got brothers and
[35:06] sisters here that feel like a boss over
[35:08] the father's
[35:10] Kingdom am I hope the soaks real deep
[35:14] going to leave you in a minute let's get
[35:17] way down deep the sun was no more under
[35:21] tutor can I get a witness of of somebody
[35:24] here of a son who says I'm no longer
[35:26] under tutor amen yes amen come on
[35:30] now there's a son who's no more under a
[35:33] tutor but he was like his father Yes
[35:36] amen and his father give him certain
[35:38] things to do the father might have told
[35:40] him you take care of this field over
[35:42] here and you do this over here you take
[35:44] care of the slaves you take care of
[35:46] whatever it is he was in full possession
[35:49] amen so when the book is added to you
[35:52] it's the father giving you amen a job to
[35:55] do on the earth when he's saying th
[35:57] prophesy again he is doing this to you
[36:00] giving you full possession
[36:02] amen remember now the book is a titled
[36:05] deed of man's Redemption the book has
[36:08] names so who has the book John has the
[36:11] book The Bride has the book so the
[36:13] bride's Ministry to prophesy again is to
[36:15] call those names that are in the book
[36:17] amen thank you Lord praise the Lord
[36:22] yes amen obviously this is not skim me
[36:25] skim milk now amen this is meat for the
[36:28] Bride of Jesus Christ amen praise the
[36:31] Lord now remember what we spoke in on
[36:34] wedes day facing up to the realities of
[36:37] your
[36:38] inheritance when a wool is read the
[36:40] father Can Read certain things to you
[36:42] like this now he can leave you in charge
[36:44] of certain things but if you're a son
[36:47] who is not obedient to the will of the
[36:48] father you will let the father's Factory
[36:50] go to waste you won't manage it
[36:54] properly so you are called to the
[36:56] reading of the will in reev 10
[36:59] amen and you are put in Authority when
[37:02] he's giving you the book amen yes amen
[37:05] and he's telling you that I must
[37:06] prophesy again now what kind of son and
[37:09] daughter will we
[37:12] be he says he was in full possession for
[37:15] he was adopted into that family and his
[37:17] name on a check was as good as his
[37:20] daddy's now what God has done the reason
[37:23] we see these things and we know there's
[37:25] something wrong friend we see the
[37:26] promises of God we seed in the word but
[37:29] God has just begin to my humble opinion
[37:32] to adopting his
[37:33] son positionally calling him out to one
[37:36] side giving him a certain Ministry
[37:38] anointing them for that purpose sending
[37:41] them out watch what happens when he does
[37:44] now watch where the Prophet goes with
[37:45] this everything that he has given him
[37:47] possession over will
[37:49] take given him possession over will take
[37:53] place God adopted his own son like that
[37:56] amen Jesus walking as an ordinary man
[37:59] but one day upon Mon's Transfiguration
[38:02] he taken three as a
[38:04] witness Peter James John hope faith
[38:08] charity watch how he sandwiches are all
[38:10] thing together called him out and
[38:13] separated Jesus from them and he
[38:15] overshadowed
[38:18] him and the Bible said is Raymond sha
[38:21] like the son in its strength what was it
[38:24] that special robe God adopting his son
[38:28] now he's going to progress that thought
[38:30] now into his church you that's
[38:32] positionally seated in Heavenly places
[38:34] in Christ Jesus be humble Brethren
[38:38] someday the holy spirit will speak to
[38:40] you
[38:41] amen amen call you out to one side
[38:44] somewhere in a little cabin on a
[38:46] hillside or in the washroom somewhere
[38:48] and they will anoint you for a certain
[38:50] service or certain thing to do amen
[38:54] thank you Lord amen so he's going to
[38:56] personalize your adoption
[38:58] somebody say Amen you are not going to
[39:01] get adopted as a church group God is
[39:03] going to personalize your adoption he
[39:05] said it might be in a cabin a hillside a
[39:08] washroom but somewhere God will anoint
[39:10] you for a certain service
[39:14] amen it won't be laying on the hand of
[39:17] presp or Elders can you see what he's
[39:19] saying the power won't be laying only in
[39:21] the ministry it won't be laying in the
[39:24] hand of the presbyters and Elders it
[39:26] will be laying on the hands of God
[39:27] Almighty himself to put a new ministry
[39:30] in
[39:31] you or somebody say this morning Lord
[39:34] put a new ministry in me
[39:37] amen amen and a new robe on you and to
[39:41] set you out as an example and all the
[39:44] demons out of Torment will never upset
[39:47] you right in fact you upset those demons
[39:50] yes you become a Tormentor to
[39:53] demons demons can't stand your presence
[39:56] oh why have you come to torment
[39:58] [Music]
[40:00] us amen God grant my brethren that we
[40:04] each one receive this blessing amen now
[40:08] I'm doing this very specifically because
[40:10] I want you to see it in the message of
[40:11] the
[40:12] hour I want you to see this is what the
[40:14] prophet taught about faith hope and
[40:16] charity and how it's tied to the
[40:18] adoption
[40:19] ceremony I want you to know that it's
[40:21] tied to Revelation 10 and this bride
[40:23] can't be adopted without faith hope and
[40:25] charity the essence of
[40:31] love and that's where the church has
[40:33] gone now when you got back there and was
[40:36] born again you think that settles it you
[40:39] went off at
[40:41] ease now you're finding yourself with
[40:43] cramps not enough manner backsliding
[40:46] from one meeting to another born again
[40:50] on a Sunday gone again on a
[40:52] Monday he says backsliding from one
[40:55] meeting to another what is it
[40:57] God has watched the conduct of his
[40:59] church I want you to know the Holy Ghost
[41:02] is still watching the conduct of his
[41:03] church amen he's watching our your
[41:05] approach to church he's watching how you
[41:07] come to church he's watching your
[41:09] preparation for the service he's
[41:11] watching how you just rushing here he's
[41:13] watching how your
[41:18] conduct God has watched the conduct of
[41:20] his
[41:22] church he has taken three for your
[41:24] witness now watch he first said amen
[41:28] that
[41:29] three he establishes a word in the mou
[41:33] of two or three Witnesses now he's
[41:34] calling this three Faith open charity a
[41:37] witness the Bible said three is a
[41:40] witness he took Peter James and John
[41:42] love hope
[41:43] charity he means to say faith open
[41:46] charity now the the reason the church is
[41:49] not
[41:50] progressing you skipped about from place
[41:52] to place here and there dling in the
[41:55] world and around this way and fussing
[41:57] about your organization and your
[41:59] denomination whether you this that or
[42:02] the others whether you're Oneness Tess
[42:04] threeness Fess whether you've been
[42:06] baptized fac forward backwards or all
[42:09] kinds of things and fussing and drawing
[42:10] barriers and things that's the reason
[42:12] the church is not going on it's true
[42:15] right
[42:16] amen I see this way I see this way I
[42:19] believe this way I believe that way Same
[42:22] Spirit crept into the
[42:24] message he says if you'd ever break down
[42:27] your walls let this one be this and that
[42:31] one be that whatever you are that
[42:33] doesn't matter but when you can put your
[42:35] hand in your brother's hand and call him
[42:37] brother we're working for one cause
[42:40] that's the kingdom of God
[42:42] hallelujah if you ever get to a place
[42:44] that I couldn't put my arm around my
[42:45] brother that's working for the kingdom
[42:47] of God and recognize him as my brother I
[42:50] feel I'm backslid that's right I'd be
[42:53] scared to stand on the platform and face
[42:54] evil spirits to know that I end in my
[42:57] heart against any brother and how dare
[42:59] we come that way how dare we come to
[43:02] stand on the ppit with with the hot in
[43:04] our
[43:05] hearts doesn't the Bible say if you have
[43:07] ought against your brother leave your
[43:09] gift at the altar amen go and reconcile
[43:11] with your brother
[43:13] first but but the Bible says
[43:16] [Music]
[43:17] fools will go with up nail shoes where
[43:20] even Angels Fear to
[43:23] trou I pray it hasn't been our case that
[43:26] we've come come to face evil spirits
[43:28] knowing that we had Envy in our hearts
[43:30] against our
[43:31] brothers he says no matter who he is
[43:34] that's trying to preach the Gospel of
[43:35] Jesus or live a Christian Life if we
[43:38] disagree a million miles upon theology
[43:40] if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my
[43:44] brother it's my sister and we've draw
[43:47] those lines and if you can't love your
[43:49] brother whom you have seen how can you
[43:51] love God whom you have never seen amen
[43:54] and brother when love goes out God goes
[43:56] with it
[43:58] when John goes off the Earth love goes
[44:00] with it when the bride goes off the
[44:02] Earth love leaves the
[44:03] [Music]
[44:05] Earth God goes with it for God is love
[44:08] and you can never get anywhere without
[44:10] Divine love as you love one another you
[44:12] love
[44:14] God Amen Prophet is progressing his
[44:17] thought now he's showing you how God
[44:19] fixes the drama and there's a reason why
[44:21] we are showing you this now he's showing
[44:23] you and he's saying when he was
[44:26] foreshadowing Jes Jesus the first time
[44:29] there he did a specific work right he
[44:33] says and on the road up as God was
[44:34] fixing to set a drama he taken three
[44:37] Witnesses Peter James and
[44:39] John now I just love to look at this in
[44:42] this respect as Peter representing Faith
[44:45] James representing hope John
[44:47] love charity hope faith those three
[44:50] great
[44:52] Witnesses and in Earth there's three
[44:54] great w three Witnesses faith Hope
[44:57] Charity the Bible teaches that he
[45:00] brought forth faith hope charity to give
[45:02] witness of what he was just fixing to do
[45:06] remember I'm driving a point here now
[45:08] the reason why we must establish Faith
[45:10] open love God is showing his fixing to
[45:12] do something
[45:14] amen that's right now I know many Bible
[45:18] teachers here tonight are saying what's
[45:20] he going at where's the prophet going
[45:21] with this I know the correct picture of
[45:24] this Brethren foreshadowing the coming
[45:26] of Jesus amen so foreshadowing the
[45:30] coming of Jesus faith hope and charity
[45:33] will be the Church of God yes amen but
[45:36] tonight I wish to take it a little
[45:38] different
[45:39] sphere he says every subject in the
[45:42] Bible everything in the Bible ties
[45:44] together in every word in the Bible the
[45:46] entire Bible every word ties to ties
[45:48] into Jesus Christ amen every type every
[45:52] shadow everything ties in so this Faith
[45:54] open charity he's trying to show it ties
[45:56] in
[45:57] greet your brother and sister say God
[45:58] bless you says now now is not the time
[46:01] to sleep we are on the home stretch now
[46:04] amen we on the home stretch now amen
[46:07] some of you feeling like Peter James and
[46:08] John they up on the mountain you're
[46:11] going
[46:11] [Music]
[46:14] to Peter James and
[46:17] John they love to sleep these
[46:20] three we just showed you in the Bible
[46:24] Jesus took them up on the mountain
[46:25] before he was transfigured they they
[46:27] were
[46:28] out you'll see again now in the Garden
[46:30] of Gethsemane they were out so Peter
[46:34] James and John needs to be kept awake
[46:38] amen amen praise the
[46:42] Lord what is the prophet saying
[46:44] everything ties together it's
[46:46] foreshadowing the coming
[46:49] amen right
[46:58] he says if you can the next quote now if
[47:00] you can have faith and hope and love
[47:04] you're near the Kingdom of
[47:06] Heaven am the three great
[47:09] things God taken those as a
[47:13] confirmation because in the mouth of two
[47:16] or three Witnesses let every word be
[47:19] established then again it represented
[47:23] the placing of his son amen Faith open
[47:27] charity represents the placing of his
[47:29] son
[47:32] amen praise the
[47:35] Lord so the next quote in spiritual
[47:38] adoption he says under the witness of
[47:40] adoption under the witness of Faith
[47:42] under the witness of love God placed his
[47:44] son positionally in the public of all
[47:47] three great manifestations so now he's
[47:50] calling it a
[47:52] manifestation everybody following amen
[47:56] amen talking about still now about his
[47:58] adoption God Gathering three people and
[48:00] three is a confirmation or a witness in
[48:03] the word of
[48:05] God
[48:09] Amen I want to remind you don't take
[48:12] faith alone don't take hope alone don't
[48:14] take love alone you got to be this
[48:17] threedimensional
[48:18] being yes if you want to go in the
[48:20] Rapture if you want to be
[48:22] adopted praise the Lord amen
[48:28] in the message there in the paragraph 13
[48:31] He says John was once different you know
[48:34] he was the one who wanted to call down
[48:36] fire from heaven destroy the city
[48:39] because you wouldn't give him something
[48:40] to eat down there so Myster to him and
[48:43] he wanted to burn the whole thing up and
[48:45] then after Jesus got all of him he
[48:47] changed him into a man of
[48:50] love thank you Lord he says those three
[48:53] elements the sufficient element to work
[48:56] out every problem the church has amen
[49:00] now watch where we've progressed with
[49:03] this it's no longer just words Faith
[49:05] open charity he's calling it a
[49:07] manifestation he's calling it God's
[49:09] confirmation he's calling it God's
[49:11] placing of the church and now he's
[49:14] saying those three elements the
[49:15] sufficient elements to work out every
[49:18] problem the church has amen
[49:25] amen you let faith open charity getting
[49:27] among the people in a church watch what
[49:30] takes place
[49:32] amen so he manifested his son before all
[49:35] three these great elements hope faith
[49:38] charity now I want you to notice on
[49:41] under the cloud was three others Moses
[49:44] Elijah and Jesus three is a confirmation
[49:47] confirms
[49:49] anything praise the
[49:54] Lord in the message am amen the that the
[49:57] next quot we're going to skip that one
[49:58] go to the next one he says the three
[50:00] greatest witness we have in the
[50:01] Christian Realms
[50:03] anyhow it says in the next one we find
[50:07] when they got on the mountain these
[50:08] three gifts hope faith and charity
[50:10] almost cover the the whole sphere of
[50:13] gifts charity being the greatest love
[50:17] amen thank you Lord amen the next one he
[50:21] says and that is also wrapped in every
[50:23] Ministry that comes from God faith hope
[50:25] charity faith to perform his word hope
[50:28] for the people and love for
[50:30] all praise the
[50:34] Lord Mark 14:33 as we close
[50:39] now we might close a bit earlier because
[50:42] I know you feeling very hot praise the
[50:46] Lord Mark
[50:52] 14:33 and he taketh with him Peter James
[50:56] and John and began to be so amazed and
[51:00] to be very heavy and he said unto them
[51:02] my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto
[51:04] death T here and
[51:07] watch and he went forward a little and
[51:10] fell on the ground and he prayed if it
[51:12] were possible the hour might pass from
[51:15] him and he said our father all things
[51:18] are possible unto thee take away this
[51:20] cup from me nevertheless not what I will
[51:23] but what thou Wilt amen
[51:27] and he cometh and finded them
[51:30] sleeping and he said unto Peter Simon
[51:33] sleepest thou could not thou watch one
[51:37] hour Watch and Pray lest you enter into
[51:40] temptation the spirit truly is ready but
[51:42] the flesh is weak and again he went away
[51:44] and prayed and spake the same
[51:47] words and when he returned he found him
[51:49] asleep
[51:50] again for their eyes were heavy neither
[51:54] wish they what to answer him second time
[51:56] they didn't even know what to answer
[51:58] Jesus they were just sheepishly sleeping
[52:01] there and he came the third time and
[52:03] said unto them sleep on now take your
[52:07] rest it is enough the hour is come
[52:09] behold the son of man is betrayed into
[52:11] the hands of
[52:13] Sinners amen so in his most tender hour

[52:20] the last week of jesus' life when the
[52:22] weight of the world's sin was upon his
[52:23] shoulder and feeling the horror of the
[52:25] cross
[52:27] he's drawing strength from the father
[52:29] and he's asking Faith open charity to
[52:32] watch with
[52:36] him
