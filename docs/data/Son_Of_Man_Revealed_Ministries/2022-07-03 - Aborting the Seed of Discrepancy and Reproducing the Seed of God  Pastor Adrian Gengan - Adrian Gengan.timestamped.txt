[0:00] amen greetings in the name of our lord
[0:02] and savior jesus christ amen good to be
[0:05] found back in the house of the lord
[0:06] again amen let's turn to our scripture
[0:11] the book of matthew 13
[0:15] amen
[0:20] hallelujah
[0:21] matthew 13 and verse 24
[0:28] amen
[0:29] this is speaking about the parable of
[0:32] the sower
[0:34] and then after the soul went
[0:36] another reap a sower
[0:38] amen you went to sow seeds as well
[0:41] [Music]
[0:43] we'll read from verse 24
[0:46] it says another parable putting forth
[0:48] unto them saying
[0:49] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[0:51] man with sowed good seed in his field
[0:54] [Music]
[0:55] but while men slept his enemy came and
[0:59] sowed tears among the wheat
[1:02] and went his way
[1:06] so that's a man with no responsibility
[1:08] he just sold and he went
[1:11] amen but when the blade was sprung up
[1:14] and brought forth fruit then appeared
[1:16] the tears also
[1:19] so you see where he left his uh seed in
[1:21] the church
[1:23] so the servants of the outsolder came
[1:25] and said unto him sir
[1:27] does not thou sow good seed in thy field
[1:29] from whence then added tears
[1:31] he said unto them and the enemy had done
[1:33] this
[1:35] the servant said unto him ruled out then
[1:38] that we go and gather them up
[1:40] but he said nay lest while you gather up
[1:42] the tears you root up also the wheat
[1:45] with them look at father's love
[1:47] amen father will also take care of the
[1:49] chairs because he doesn't want to bring
[1:51] arm to his children
[1:53] let both grow together until the harvest
[1:56] and in the time of harvest i will say to
[1:58] the reapers gather here together the
[2:01] first the tears and bind them in bundles
[2:04] to burn them but gather the wheat
[2:06] into my bun amen you may be seated
[2:13] hallelujah
[2:16] [Music]
[2:19] amen
[2:21] so for a little title we'll take
[2:23] a thought called aborting the seeds of
[2:25] discrepancy
[2:27] and bringing forth the seed of god
[2:29] amen aborting the seed of discrepancy
[2:34] and bringing forth the seed of god
[2:37] amen so from this parable we see that
[2:40] there are two sowers
[2:42] sorry i gotta hold this those i can't
[2:43] see my screen
[2:48] we learn that there are two souls in the
[2:49] field
[2:50] the good sower like we know is jesus
[2:53] the son of god who went forth sowing the
[2:56] word
[2:56] and the and an enemy the devil came up
[2:59] to him and sowed the seed of discrepancy
[3:03] amen
[3:04] [Music]
[3:06] with the kill once you get that set up
[3:07] this notes here you can follow along
[3:10] and an enemy now the devil we said so
[3:13] the seeds of discrepancy
[3:16] now we know this has happened through
[3:18] every age since the beginning of the
[3:20] garden of eden
[3:22] amen it's always been the case every
[3:24] time god came in on the scene
[3:27] the enemy came in on the scene
[3:29] amen so even in the garden now the
[3:32] garden of eden there types this parable
[3:34] that the lord jesus is talking about
[3:36] because we find two sowers in the field
[3:40] amen the serpent sowed his seed and adam
[3:43] sowed his seed
[3:46] hallelujah
[3:47] [Music]
[3:49] god told them not to break one word he
[3:52] told them every word must be kept they
[3:54] must live by that word
[3:57] not so
[3:59] now that's the beginning of the bible in
[4:01] the middle of the bible jesus tells us
[4:03] again
[4:04] that man shall not live by bread alone
[4:07] but by every word that comes out of the
[4:09] mouth of god
[4:11] and then in the closing book of
[4:13] revelation he tells us whosoever shall
[4:16] take one word out of the book or add
[4:18] another one to it his part will be taken
[4:21] from the book of life
[4:24] now even though they disobeyed god's
[4:26] word and brought death to the human race
[4:28] god's solution
[4:31] now follow my thoughts
[4:33] two sowers went to sow
[4:35] the serpent sowed his seed
[4:38] adam sowed his seed
[4:41] but even though there were two seeds now
[4:43] in the bedding ground of eve
[4:45] god did not terminate the pregnancy
[4:49] amen abortion is not god's plan
[4:54] all of life on earth today came from god
[4:56] he is the source of life
[4:59] god values life and his plan of
[5:01] redemption is to preserve life
[5:04] amen he is restoring us back to our
[5:06] original condition god does not have a
[5:09] replacement policy
[5:11] god has a restoration policy
[5:14] amen he says i will restore save the
[5:16] lord amen
[5:18] amen now we find that if we can type our
[5:20] fleshly carnal nature brother branham
[5:23] calls this the first husband
[5:26] our first nature is the first husband
[5:28] and he and we can type it like that
[5:30] first nature being like cain
[5:33] in the flesh we are envious we are
[5:35] jealous and we want to be rewarded for
[5:38] the works of the flesh
[5:40] but he says we must die to the first
[5:42] nature amen now brother branham
[5:46] tells us here he labels to tell us do
[5:48] not divorce the first nature
[5:51] you know what happens when somebody gets
[5:53] divorced
[5:54] and remarried the first husband wants
[5:57] visitation rights
[5:59] so he always hangs around
[6:02] he always comes around
[6:04] now we don't want our first nature to
[6:06] come around
[6:08] amen there's no visitation rights for
[6:10] the first nature
[6:12] that first nature must die
[6:17] and we must be born again
[6:19] now satan could not stop abel and his
[6:21] revelation
[6:23] amen adam's true seed
[6:26] if if nobody knew that there was a
[6:29] serpent seed in the garden of eden just
[6:31] by watching these two boys adam's true
[6:34] seed would be revealed
[6:37] when it came time to worship
[6:41] jesus said to them let both grow but at
[6:44] hour's time it's easier to spot the
[6:46] tears
[6:48] from the wheat
[6:50] amen now we are in another hour's time
[6:53] and now is the time the father is
[6:54] seeking those two worshipers amen and
[6:58] when when it's time to seek true
[7:00] worshipers it will come back to the
[7:02] revelation
[7:04] amen the revelation of the one god will
[7:08] reveal who our father is
[7:11] amen week after week cain is going to
[7:14] church offering worship to a trinity of
[7:17] gods
[7:20] but abel is offering to the one true
[7:22] living god
[7:23] abel knows that god was condescending
[7:25] from spirit to word to flesh
[7:29] in order for us to go from flesh to word
[7:32] that's our theophany back to a glorified
[7:35] body a spiritual body
[7:38] amen
[7:39] now important thing the prophet is
[7:41] telling us in the invisible union of the
[7:43] bride of christ he says if we see the
[7:46] conduct of woman in the world today
[7:49] what are we doing we are looking at a
[7:51] natural type being a spiritual thing
[7:55] he says if you want to see what's
[7:57] happening in the church
[7:58] watch the women of the world
[8:00] watch the conduct of the worldly church
[8:02] today
[8:04] he says of course now there is also the
[8:07] conduct of the spiritual bride
[8:10] the church
[8:11] watch
[8:12] that also
[8:15] two people two women to watch
[8:19] amen
[8:21] watch the woman of the world so there's
[8:23] three women there if you notice watch
[8:24] the woman of the world the conduct of
[8:26] the worldly church and then there's the
[8:28] bride the spiritual bride
[8:31] he says because the natural so-called
[8:33] claim or to be bright also right he says
[8:35] notice this character when you see a
[8:38] woman go on the rampage
[8:40] not the men now
[8:43] watch the women
[8:46] when you see women just go on the
[8:48] rampage just doing anything they want to
[8:51] do
[8:52] the church is doing the same thing
[8:56] amen
[8:58] for as the world satan the deceiver who
[9:02] deceived the first bride
[9:04] to sinning against god by misbelieving
[9:06] his word and now today as we see the
[9:09] church natural
[9:11] in in your intellectual gospel going
[9:13] further and further away from the word
[9:17] a social gospel
[9:20] we find the woman of the world on the
[9:21] streets
[9:23] members of such carrying themselves in
[9:25] the in the same atmosphere you can't
[9:27] tell them
[9:29] they lost all sense of common decency
[9:32] the people have see and that's the way
[9:34] the church has and you can see it going
[9:38] straight to the economical council just
[9:41] as certain as anything in the world and
[9:44] right into rome as hard as it can go
[9:46] because it's prophesied and there she is
[9:49] that's her behavior
[9:51] what you're going somewhere with this
[9:52] now watch the behavior of the woman
[9:56] watch the natural women
[9:58] watch the depth they are typing the
[10:00] church carnal
[10:02] amen
[10:07] now our thought is aborting the seeds of
[10:09] discrepancy
[10:11] so what is going on with abortion rights
[10:14] at the moment
[10:16] that's big in the news you know june
[10:18] 24th
[10:23] what is abortion the killing of unborn
[10:26] babies
[10:27] you'll find roe v wade was overturned
[10:30] roe v wade is a case
[10:33] that was tried in the courts
[10:35] i think it was back in 1970 something
[10:40] 73
[10:41] now it was overturned in 2022.
[10:44] many of you don't know what this means
[10:47] amen
[10:48] many of us have not do you know that 73
[10:51] million babies are killed
[10:55] every year
[10:56] 73 million
[11:02] why
[11:03] what's the condition of the woman
[11:06] they don't want commitment
[11:09] they are aborting the seed yes
[11:13] because they do not want responsibility
[11:15] yes amen brother branham says they want
[11:17] to run around and party
[11:20] they've glamorized
[11:22] and sexualized women
[11:24] and made them nothing but a sex object
[11:27] and they'll go about saying this is my
[11:29] right
[11:30] the movement says my body my right
[11:35] our movement says it's his body and it's
[11:38] his right amount
[11:40] amen
[11:43] so we find roe v wade was overturned by
[11:45] the supreme court
[11:47] if you look at if you can see that he
[11:49] says i am a woman not a whom that first
[11:52] placard on top that woman is carrying
[11:54] she says i'm a woman not a whom
[11:57] but a woman means a wombed man
[12:00] do you know there's something
[12:02] going on in the u.s more especially
[12:03] that's a corrupt country
[12:08] they call it gender neutral
[12:10] they cannot define a woman anymore
[12:13] but last week they clearly defined what
[12:15] a woman was
[12:16] they forgot about gender neutral and
[12:18] everyone went crazy when they overturned
[12:19] this
[12:20] now they think we're a woman you take
[12:22] away our rights
[12:24] suddenly they know what a woman is
[12:29] look at the next picture they say we
[12:31] won't breathe for you
[12:34] but what was a woman given for
[12:38] yes
[12:38] the bible says she shall be saved
[12:40] through childbearing
[12:45] now
[12:46] in the first exodus we know they killed
[12:49] two years and under
[12:52] because they were afraid of the
[12:53] deliverer that was going to come
[12:56] they knew it would change their world
[12:57] order and disrupt the plans they had for
[13:00] the earthly kingdom exodus 1 15 you'll
[13:02] find the king of egypt pharaoh speaking
[13:05] to the hebrew midwives and telling them
[13:07] in verse 16 amen that
[13:10] if it be a son you shall kill him but if
[13:13] he'd be a daughter then she shall live
[13:16] and pharaoh charged all his people
[13:18] saying every son that is born you shall
[13:20] cast into the river every daughter you
[13:22] shall save a life
[13:24] killing of children in the first exodus
[13:27] second exit the same thing eric ordering
[13:30] the killing
[13:33] matthew 2 16 you'll find he says eric
[13:36] when he saw he was mocked of the wise
[13:37] men was exceeding wrath and sent forth
[13:40] and slew all the children that were in
[13:41] bethlehem
[13:43] and in the course they are from two
[13:45] years and under according to the time
[13:47] which he had diligently and quiet of the
[13:49] wise men
[13:53] and now we find in the third exodus
[13:57] mass killing of babies
[14:00] mass killing
[14:02] amen and nobody says anything about it
[14:04] so we find amen abortion is a woman
[14:07] refusing to accept the seed of a man to
[14:10] reproduce life
[14:12] and you'll find that brother branham
[14:13] says that a woman was given to a man to
[14:16] reproduce his life
[14:18] when god created man in the garden of
[14:21] eden he told him to multiply and
[14:23] replenish the earth
[14:26] so their objective is to go against
[14:28] god's word
[14:31] amen what is it showing us the condition
[14:34] of the natural woman is showing you the
[14:36] condition of the spiritual church world
[14:40] they also do not want to accept the seed
[14:42] word of god
[14:44] like the natural woman
[14:46] the natural woman wants to substitute
[14:49] babies for cats and dogs
[14:51] brother branham says because of that
[14:52] maternal instinct within her she'll
[14:54] nurture anything she'll mother anything
[14:58] so she puts clothes on a dog
[15:01] and refuses to raise a child
[15:04] because it'll disfigure her body
[15:07] yes she won't have the freedom to go
[15:09] where she wants to
[15:10] go amen
[15:13] and i prayed not so spiritually that we
[15:15] do not want to reproduce the life of
[15:17] christ because it will disfigure our
[15:19] bodies
[15:21] it will just figure our image that we
[15:23] want to portray to the world
[15:25] i don't want people to see me as a holy
[15:27] roller
[15:30] amen
[15:32] what are they doing
[15:33] amen
[15:35] they want substitutes like cats and dogs
[15:38] so to the church spiritual women once
[15:42] substitutes for the word of god they've
[15:43] taken creeds and dogmas
[15:47] to mother and their mother that creed
[15:49] and dogma instead of the word of god
[15:52] they will hold more precious they create
[15:54] in the dogma more than the word of god
[15:58] the natural is verse the spiritual type
[16:01] is showing us the condition that they
[16:03] are trying to stop the natural birth of
[16:06] children naturally they are trying to
[16:09] stop the birth of children but
[16:11] spiritually they are trying to stop the
[16:13] new birth
[16:17] amen
[16:19] now it didn't make
[16:21] abortion illegal in america because it
[16:24] can still be practiced but in certain
[16:25] states all they've done is overturn the
[16:27] decision so that each state can make
[16:29] their own laws
[16:32] right it doesn't mean that abortion is
[16:34] banned
[16:37] because yeah in south africa abortion is
[16:39] legal too
[16:40] the killing of the unborn
[16:42] is glorified
[16:46] and you know what
[16:47] even us we've all grown accustomed to it
[16:50] and there's no cry out against it
[16:55] amen
[16:56] it's become normalized
[16:58] people don't cry out against sin
[17:02] people don't cry against the justice for
[17:04] the unborn
[17:06] and they let laws be passed in the land
[17:10] amen
[17:12] hallelujah
[17:14] so women's rights groups are protesting
[17:17] abortion rights activist slogans are my
[17:19] right to choose and my body my right and
[17:22] that is the condition of the church
[17:23] spiritual they want to have their right
[17:25] about their church body
[17:28] they don't want all the word they pick
[17:30] and choose what portions of the world
[17:32] they want
[17:33] and they settle for blessings only they
[17:36] don't want the giver of the blessings
[17:39] what are they telling you they want a
[17:41] sea donor
[17:48] and they want nothing to do with the man
[17:50] called christ jesus
[17:52] they only want a donor
[17:55] didn't the book of assad tell us that
[17:57] they want they said give us your name
[17:59] only
[18:01] he says seven women will take hold of
[18:03] one man
[18:05] they want to adopt rather you find these
[18:08] women that have careers in hollywood
[18:10] they will rather go and adopt a african
[18:13] child
[18:14] but they can raise their own child
[18:18] they want to raise something that's not
[18:20] their own
[18:22] so to the church
[18:25] they are not raising their their own
[18:28] they have adopted a creed and a dogma in
[18:30] the catholic church system and
[18:32] everything that they have
[18:35] they adopted amen they adopt an
[18:37] experience of a day gone by yes amen and
[18:40] that's what they are trying to do in the
[18:41] message of the hour
[18:43] trying to adopt an experience of a day
[18:46] gone by
[18:47] jesus didn't die in 1965
[18:51] jesus is alive he's the same yesterday
[18:53] today and forever the holy ghost didn't
[18:56] leave the earth in 1965
[18:59] amen
[19:01] stop trying to take a church and given
[19:03] an experience from a day gone by
[19:06] amen
[19:08] hallelujah you'll find all kinds of isms
[19:11] rising up in the message
[19:13] but we must stay the course amen we must
[19:16] walk the line amen
[19:19] hallelujah amen
[19:21] oh we what are they doing they got an
[19:24] experience they've adopted an experience
[19:26] they don't want the word and the holy
[19:28] ghost give them their own experience and
[19:31] their own new birth
[19:34] every predestinated son and daughter of
[19:36] god will that will be born on the earth
[19:39] amen nothing can stop a predestinated
[19:42] son and daughter from being born on the
[19:44] earth
[19:48] no amount of abortion laws can stop
[19:50] god's predestination seed from coming
[19:53] forth yes amen
[19:57] nothing can stop them from being
[19:59] manifested on the earth even and now can
[20:01] you imagine if all hell is aimed now
[20:05] because that is not a natural thing for
[20:07] a human to kill somebody
[20:09] that is demon powers possessing them
[20:15] you watch these women's rights group
[20:17] there is an abundance of women on the
[20:19] streets where's the men
[20:23] this is a woman's rights thing
[20:28] now if all hell is aimed at preventing
[20:30] life of the natural body how much more
[20:33] is the attack on the spiritual body to
[20:35] prevent the new birth
[20:37] yes
[20:40] so what are we talking about aborting
[20:43] the seed of discrepancy
[20:47] and reproducing the seed of god
[20:50] amen
[20:52] so at one time
[20:54] they did receive some seed
[20:57] they received justification
[21:00] sanctification amen they were receiving
[21:03] it
[21:04] amen and they were pregnant
[21:07] and they were going to come forth in a
[21:08] new birth
[21:10] because the new birth requires three
[21:11] stages
[21:13] and they were coming amen coming up and
[21:15] up
[21:16] the pentecostals received just the
[21:18] initial evidence they had some emotion
[21:22] they were in labor pain
[21:26] but then
[21:28] there was an abortion
[21:34] they killed it
[21:36] they stifled it
[21:38] they settled
[21:42] for tradition of man
[21:46] amen hallelujah yes amen
[21:50] they did not go on to receive the new
[21:52] birth and the baptism of the holy ghost
[21:56] why
[21:59] they rejected
[22:02] the gynecologist
[22:05] william branham
[22:10] amen yes amen
[22:12] they rejected him
[22:18] and now
[22:20] if they in the u.s are saying now
[22:22] remember what is it going back to back
[22:25] to the political lines
[22:27] the red states will have abortion or
[22:29] anti-abortion laws
[22:31] the blue states will have pro-abortion
[22:33] laws
[22:35] everything is going back to politics
[22:37] amen
[22:38] so in those certain states
[22:41] those red states you'll find it's
[22:43] illegal to abort
[22:46] we want satan to know there will be no
[22:48] spiritual abortions
[22:50] you cannot abort the word of god that's
[22:52] been shown in our hearts amen amen
[22:55] hallelujah
[22:58] we know the holy spirit gives life to
[23:00] the word it quickens the word that was
[23:03] sown within us
[23:05] we are going all the way to the new
[23:06] birth the baptism of the holy ghost
[23:10] isn't that what we've been speaking
[23:12] about in the adoption series
[23:14] our new land
[23:16] the holy ghost to quicken means to bring
[23:18] to life
[23:20] that's what the holy spirit has come to
[23:21] do to bring to
[23:23] life god's own life zoe life
[23:26] the genuine holy spirit only brings to
[23:29] life his own
[23:31] amen let that settle in your heart
[23:34] the holy spirit will not bring to life
[23:36] something that's not of his yes so if
[23:38] you got a wrong spirit stone within you
[23:41] it will not bring that to life
[23:43] if you want the holy spirit to bring the
[23:45] word of god to life in you you must die
[23:48] to the everything that's not of god amen
[23:51] amen you cannot have twins growing in
[23:54] this room
[23:56] this is not the room of heave in the
[23:58] garden of eden
[23:59] you cannot have cain growing with abel
[24:02] in this bride amen
[24:08] amen
[24:09] one must die
[24:13] amen it won't bring a creed to life the
[24:16] holy spirit won't bring a creed to life
[24:18] the holy spirit won't bring traditions
[24:21] and man's ideas to life but it will
[24:23] bring the word of god to life amen it'll
[24:26] quicken the body of christ in the moment
[24:29] in the twinkling of an eye
[24:33] let's go in the invisible union of the
[24:35] bride of christ paragraph 49 it says but
[24:37] watch now he's talking about us let's
[24:39] focus on us a bit
[24:41] when the spiritual bride when she begins
[24:43] to have a revival
[24:46] when she begins to come back and line
[24:48] herself up with the word of god
[24:50] watch then you see how the scriptures at
[24:52] that time there will be a message sweep
[24:55] to catch their bride
[24:57] catch that woman elect but then watch
[25:00] again to the spiritual church how that
[25:03] groups of people called out the elected
[25:05] through every revival
[25:08] he says in martin luther it happened the
[25:10] same way in the reformation it happened
[25:12] the same in the time of john wesley it
[25:15] happened the same thing when pentecostal
[25:17] first started they dropped them woman
[25:19] right back in line with the word
[25:21] and then they drift away
[25:25] let it not be the case with us
[25:30] there she goes right back over into
[25:32] chaos
[25:33] but then the time that the people are
[25:35] ready to line up there is a message
[25:37] comes forth and they line with it amen
[25:42] amen but remember satan is a deceiver
[25:48] he'll come in with deception
[25:50] you'll say but i i don't believe in
[25:51] abortion i haven't aborted the seed but
[25:53] he's aborted your prayer life
[25:57] he's aborted your bible reading time
[26:01] he's aborted you don't even listen to
[26:03] the tapes anymore
[26:05] aborted it
[26:10] you'll get what you want
[26:12] you want to just come on a sunday and
[26:13] listen to us a fancy sermon you'll get
[26:16] it
[26:21] he comes in with fertility
[26:23] he comes in with deception
[26:25] slowly chipping away
[26:27] taking inch by inch
[26:28] [Music]
[26:29] what's it brother ram is your favorite
[26:31] saying
[26:32] what's he doing it
[26:34] it's like a
[26:36] frog in the water heating it up slowly
[26:43] amen
[26:45] luther was the messenger of one day of
[26:48] justification the church lined right
[26:50] with death
[26:52] wesley comes sanctification the church
[26:54] lined with it pentecost came restoration
[26:57] of the gifts the church lined with it
[26:59] the elect of that day then faded away
[27:01] went right back off into
[27:03] denominationalism
[27:04] went right out to the rest of them
[27:09] but you notice when people try to align
[27:11] with the word of god there comes a fresh
[27:13] message
[27:15] from the word of god
[27:17] right straight to the people and they
[27:19] catch that message and line up every
[27:21] time
[27:23] he says we have that
[27:26] amen we've got a fresh message
[27:30] we want the seed of jesus christ
[27:32] and the spirit of christ
[27:35] amen
[27:38] the prophet cried out against that
[27:42] amen you wanted us to fall in love with
[27:44] jesus to have a relationship with jesus
[27:49] people as brother branham says sometimes
[27:51] people take on the spirit of the pastor
[27:53] and they think they got the holy spirit
[27:56] hallelujah
[28:02] the people of that age
[28:03] that manifest that promised word is the
[28:06] seed of that age
[28:09] are you the people of this age
[28:11] are you manifesting the promised word of
[28:12] today then he says you are the seed of
[28:15] today
[28:18] they are the children of the kingdom
[28:20] amen aren't you glad that we are the
[28:22] children of the kingdom
[28:24] amen we are the children of the kingdom
[28:27] amen
[28:28] for the children of the king have a
[28:30] right to shout and sing
[28:34] the manifestation of the holy spirit
[28:36] operating through his children in those
[28:40] seed of the kingdom of that age
[28:45] amen
[28:47] all of god's program
[28:49] all of his culmination of his redemption
[28:52] plan is resting on you and i
[28:57] stay the am
[28:59] stay in line
[29:01] amen hallelujah
[29:04] we must press for perfection we must
[29:07] press on amen to reach the mark of the
[29:10] eye calling amen
[29:13] blessed be the name of jesus amen amen
[29:17] hallelujah
[29:18] oh hallelujah i pray tonight you are not
[29:21] just settling back and thinking hey it's
[29:23] another wednesday night
[29:26] but be on fire for god
[29:28] amen hallelujah
[29:31] if god is admonishing us tonight here is
[29:33] warning
[29:36] because he said amen it will be a
[29:38] minority group that will be taken away
[29:41] not somebody who's playing church
[29:45] amen
[29:47] we are losing gems
[29:49] we are losing precious souls
[29:52] that came in under the first wave of the
[29:54] message
[29:56] to sweep durban
[30:02] let us hold precious message
[30:04] amen
[30:05] let us hold dear the message that was
[30:07] passed on to us yes
[30:10] let us be true to it
[30:11] [Music]
[30:13] let us hold ourselves accountable to the
[30:15] word of god
[30:17] amen we all if we are working we want to
[30:20] be accountable to some boss to some
[30:22] earthly boss
[30:24] how about our heavenly boss can we be
[30:26] held accountable to him
[30:31] [Music]
[30:33] now he wants to talk to us a bit
[30:37] and watch how reverend he is when he's
[30:39] talking about this bride
[30:41] he says may i add to this woman
[30:44] grace
[30:47] you say brother but
[30:49] there's nothing good in me
[30:51] grace
[30:54] amen i don't deserve it
[30:56] it's his grace
[30:59] none of us deserve it
[31:02] but it is grace it's his choosing
[31:06] grace is what
[31:08] god's unmerited favor
[31:12] he says may i place her in the bible
[31:16] as called the elect lady
[31:18] hallelujah
[31:20] amen
[31:21] you may have been carrying out dish
[31:23] water in the back of the party
[31:26] but just one conversation with him
[31:29] made you the elect lady
[31:32] amen he says i'm going to talk about you
[31:35] you know the bible declares to the elect
[31:37] lady
[31:39] there if you notice elect come from the
[31:41] word elected lady
[31:43] one lady among all other ladies was
[31:46] elected
[31:48] amen some of you women know what that's
[31:50] feeling is like
[31:51] you walk around so proud with your
[31:53] husband
[31:54] amen
[31:55] and that's how the bride should be
[31:58] the bride of the lord jesus christ
[32:01] so many women flirting with him
[32:03] calling his name saying we have his name
[32:06] but you are the elected lady amen we
[32:09] chose you
[32:10] be proud of jesus christ
[32:14] amen
[32:16] he says
[32:19] if you notice elect comes from the word
[32:21] elected lady one lady amongst all the
[32:24] other ladies was elected
[32:26] like the virgin was to bring forth the
[32:28] bride
[32:30] bring forth the body of god on the earth
[32:32] she was an elected woman god chose mary
[32:35] god had chosen an elected lady which is
[32:38] his bride she is elected
[32:40] i hope we're members of that tonight
[32:43] across the world
[32:46] how many of you from south africa can
[32:48] say yes brother branham
[32:50] from across the world
[32:52] across the nation
[32:54] the illustration here
[32:56] showing the relationship of bride to
[32:58] christ the elect lady how she was
[33:01] brought to him
[33:03] where she would come from
[33:05] he knew everything about you
[33:08] amen one time you quoted that ugly
[33:11] denominational guy
[33:14] you remember
[33:16] you caught to that ugly
[33:18] some of you thinking i'm talking about
[33:20] literally i'm talking about the
[33:21] spiritual church
[33:22] you're trying to remember which ugly
[33:24] denominational guy you were watching
[33:26] i'm talking about the church
[33:29] and they took you in their church
[33:31] and they started to feed you
[33:34] and you couldn't settle because every
[33:36] week they were saying this is your
[33:38] season
[33:39] this is your time
[33:41] sowing to the ministry partner with us
[33:47] and you couldn't stomach that
[33:50] and they say do you have declarations in
[33:53] your church
[33:55] we like declarations
[33:57] i declare i am the head and not the tale
[34:01] i am blessed coming in i am blessed
[34:04] going out they're taking all our
[34:07] blessings
[34:08] and they're saying i want to declare it
[34:15] amen you'll find that they'll put their
[34:17] psalm 91
[34:19] protected by psalm 23
[34:25] they love declarations
[34:27] all of their declarations are about
[34:29] financial blessings
[34:34] amen
[34:36] then they'll tell you turn to your
[34:37] brother and prophesy
[34:42] amen
[34:47] where we are
[34:49] amen
[34:52] he says here she was she would be
[34:54] brought to him
[34:56] the church and illustration that we got
[34:58] in view is illustrated by women which a
[35:01] woman is always the type of the church
[35:03] because the church is considered a bride
[35:06] a bride she is the bride of the lord
[35:09] jesus the son of god always if you watch
[35:12] watch the conditions
[35:15] the conduct of women
[35:17] and you'll see where the church is
[35:20] but the branham in another message says
[35:22] the beauty of the church is the
[35:24] character of the people
[35:27] amen so we always ought to display a
[35:30] godly christ-like character
[35:33] amen we should never let down our lord
[35:36] jesus christ by letting that old man
[35:39] flare up
[35:40] [Music]
[35:42] because their own nature has got to die
[35:45] if you are finding their own nature
[35:46] rising up then you have only divorced
[35:48] him
[35:53] he says it's not the outside situation
[35:56] smelling here it isn't it's subject to
[35:58] death and will die but the inside part
[36:01] of you down in here inside that is the
[36:04] person that cannot die
[36:09] and that's the person that the new life
[36:11] starts from
[36:14] from this new birth and it builds
[36:17] another person in the image of this
[36:19] talking about your
[36:21] theory of your body coming
[36:24] amen
[36:25] from this new birth and it builds
[36:27] another person in the image of this
[36:29] person you are around their life you get
[36:31] it so potentially it's in here but what
[36:33] is and what is it the word promised
[36:36] before the foundation of the world
[36:38] and around there this only reflects the
[36:41] negative that will reflect a positive
[36:44] this life is nothing but a negative
[36:47] reflection of a positive you
[36:50] amen
[36:52] hallelujah yes amen if you think amen so
[36:57] highly of yourself here and you think
[37:00] that there is none like you
[37:02] you ain't seen nothing yet
[37:06] there's a better one there's a better
[37:08] body
[37:10] an improved body amen in fact it's out
[37:12] of this world
[37:16] amen
[37:19] do we read that
[37:21] so potentially it's in here what is it
[37:23] he's talking about this new life now he
[37:25] says the word promised from before the
[37:27] foundation of the world and around there
[37:29] it only reflects the negative that will
[37:32] reflect the positive
[37:34] he says
[37:35] the translation of the bride will be the
[37:36] same thing
[37:38] watch we are nearing the translation now
[37:41] right so while we're talking about this
[37:43] we are preparing for translation
[37:46] these messages are designed to give us
[37:47] faith for translation
[37:50] right
[37:53] the word that's in you
[37:55] the seed that's in you the one that you
[37:57] didn't abort
[37:58] [Music]
[38:00] the body new body will materialize
[38:03] around that word
[38:07] right he says the same thing did by
[38:08] sarah
[38:10] the word that's in you
[38:12] the body will materialize around that
[38:14] word that's in you
[38:18] so the word may be making you look
[38:20] old-fashioned
[38:22] the world may the word that's in you may
[38:23] be looking yeah people are scorning and
[38:25] laughing and mocking you
[38:28] maybe you're not even happy with your
[38:29] appearance
[38:33] but he says that seed that's in you that
[38:35] word that's in you
[38:36] that new body will materialize around
[38:38] that word
[38:41] you know which one i'm talking about the
[38:42] one that david spoke about by what have
[38:44] i hid
[38:46] in my heart
[38:47] amen
[38:49] he says
[38:50] when that old body that she had that
[38:52] first body it had to be changed in order
[38:54] to produce a sun you get it
[38:58] your body could not do it this body
[39:00] cannot do it so it has to be changed the
[39:03] same way to receive the sun
[39:07] he says not even sin is imputed to a
[39:10] genuine believer
[39:15] i don't know if you want to be a genuine
[39:16] believer
[39:18] he says not even sin is imputed to you
[39:21] did you know that
[39:22] he that's born of god does not commit
[39:24] sin
[39:25] he cannot sin
[39:27] see it's not even imputed why
[39:30] david says blessed is the man who god
[39:33] will not impute sin
[39:35] when you're in christ are we in christ
[39:38] you have no desire to sin
[39:40] the worshiper once purged as normal
[39:43] conscience of sin
[39:45] you don't desire it
[39:47] now to the world you might be a sinner
[39:50] but to god
[39:51] you're not
[39:53] because you're in christ
[39:55] how can you be a sinner when you're in
[39:58] the sinless one
[39:59] and god only sees him
[40:02] who
[40:03] you are in
[40:06] when he looks at you
[40:10] there's blood between him and you
[40:13] and he sees you as a sinless spotless
[40:16] bride
[40:17] he's given you the royal robes of his
[40:19] word to clothe yourselves amen to clothe
[40:22] ourselves in this evening time when it's
[40:24] darkness and chaos all around us when
[40:26] the scramming in the land he's given us
[40:28] food
[40:29] to eat who has given us clothing he's
[40:32] giving us food
[40:34] amen
[40:36] hallelujah what a blessed heavenly
[40:38] father
[40:39] now that one sower sold his seed in the
[40:41] field
[40:42] and he left it for somebody else to take
[40:45] care of
[40:46] god is not like that sower
[40:48] god cares for his own he turns for his
[40:51] own field
[40:52] he tends for his own crop
[40:54] he sees it all the way to others time
[40:57] amen he nurtures it he protects it
[41:01] now i'm asking you as a as the woman as
[41:03] the wife of jesus christ the seed that's
[41:06] within you protect it
[41:08] nurture it
[41:09] water it with prayer
[41:11] water it with reading the word
[41:13] nurture it give it sunlight open the
[41:16] bible and sunlight will strike you
[41:19] amen give it some vitamin d give it all
[41:22] the nutrients you need
[41:24] if we in the natural can be so
[41:26] particular about when we are raising a
[41:29] natural
[41:30] baby inside of us
[41:32] we need to get all the right nutrients
[41:35] and a mother will sacrifice a lot not
[41:37] eat certain foods
[41:39] because she wants the baby to get the
[41:41] right nutrients
[41:43] how much more the spiritual bride of
[41:44] jesus christ
[41:46] must sacrifice the things of the world
[41:49] the pleasures of the world
[41:51] so that the seed within you can get the
[41:53] right nutrients
[41:55] the right sunlight the right word
[41:58] amen hallelujah can we give the lord a
[42:01] good anchor for praise
[42:03] amen
[42:05] so
[42:05] we know what seeds of discrepancies are
[42:07] they are creeds dogmas man-made ideas
[42:12] if those things have been growing with
[42:13] us
[42:14] we need to abort them
[42:16] terminate their life
[42:18] [Music]
[42:21] and say holy spirit this evening i want
[42:24] you to sow your word in me
[42:26] amen
[42:27] amen what's the use we've come so far in
[42:30] the message
[42:32] so long in the message
[42:34] and then we fall off at the end
[42:36] because when he comes back he is looking
[42:39] for his very own life
[42:42] the token life must be on display
[42:45] amen so i pray even as this wednesday
[42:48] night prayer meeting that we can examine
[42:50] our hearts this evening church is not
[42:52] coming to listen to some good message
[42:54] but it should take it's the house of
[42:56] correction it's to check up on our body
[43:00] he says the sickest body is the church
[43:03] we ought to come into the house of the
[43:04] lord and look into the looking glass of
[43:06] god's word and say lord if this is me
[43:09] and these are the areas i need to work
[43:12] on in my life
[43:13] then let us pay attention to it let us
[43:16] give attention to the word of god
[43:18] let's focus on god now everyone has
[43:20] closed every above

[43:30] now when our husband our lord jesus
[43:32] christ comes to us
[43:35] let's not reject him like vastly
[43:40] but let's be like esther
[43:42] a woman was chosen for the king
[43:44] [Music]
[43:45] amen
[43:47] vastly had her own woman's rights
[43:50] she had her own movement going on in her
[43:51] own party
[43:54] hallelujah
[43:56] but how are we making preparation for
[43:58] the king

[44:02] command

[44:47] in the manger of my heart
[44:51] and let it live in me
[44:54] let it shine
[44:58] and live inside this house of clay
[45:03] and mold it every day
[45:07] and let your word be born
