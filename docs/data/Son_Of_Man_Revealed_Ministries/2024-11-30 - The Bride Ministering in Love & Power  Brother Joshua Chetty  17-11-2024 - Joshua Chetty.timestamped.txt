[0:23] amen you may be seated God bless
[0:26] you amen greet everyone in the name of
[0:29] our Lord and savior Jes Jesus Christ
[0:31] amen amen our God is a mighty God amen
[0:34] amen and he's worthy to be praised
[0:36] hallelujah
[0:38] amen Bible says in Psalm 57 be merciful
[0:41] unto me oh God be merciful unto me for
[0:44] my soul trusted in thee y in the shadow
[0:47] of thy Wings will I make my refuge until
[0:51] these calamities be
[0:53] overpassed I will cry unto God most high
[0:57] unto God that performed all things for
[0:59] me me he shall send from heaven and save
[1:02] me from the reproach of him that would
[1:05] swallow me up God shall send forth his
[1:08] mercy and his truth amen and he's really
[1:12] done it for us in this time and season
[1:14] amen he sent the opening of the word he
[1:16] sent us a prophetic gift amen according
[1:18] to the scriptures Revelation 10:7
[1:21] Malachi 4:5 and verse 6 Amen to turn our
[1:24] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[1:26] amen I if you've been rejoicing with the
[1:27] meetings been blessed with the services
[1:30] amen and most of all I've trust that we
[1:32] are growing in Christ amen so like the
[1:35] song says amen the song was sonng this
[1:38] morning the answer is Jesus Christ
[1:41] yahusha amen Jesus Christ he's our
[1:46] savior he's Our Redeemer he's the king
[1:48] of kings and he is the Lord of lords
[1:51] amen so I just want to share a testimony
[1:54] to give glory to God this
[1:56] morning amen
[2:00] everybody feeling good amen amen so if
[2:04] you remember last week after the service
[2:07] while we were singing We stopped singing
[2:08] and I turned to these brothers and I
[2:10] said with this teaching you can look for
[2:12] greater anointing and miracles how many
[2:15] if you remember that amen praise the
[2:17] Lord so we got a testimony to give glory
[2:20] to God and sometimes things are done in
[2:23] Simplicity and but he'll do it in a way
[2:26] to bring glory to his name yes remember
[2:28] what we've been teaching you that the
[2:31] glory will be revealed in the bride to
[2:33] give him greater glory yes amen so you
[2:38] know on Wednesday we had a prayer
[2:39] meeting how many of you enjoying the
[2:41] prayer meeting amen amen praise the Lord
[2:43] amen so Chantel we brought the prayer
[2:46] request to the church on wedness day so
[2:48] she was admitted in hospital on wedness
[2:51] day and prior to that she was diagnosed
[2:53] with kidney stones and so she said her
[2:57] inflammatory markers were really high so
[2:59] they were going to schedule her for for
[3:01] the test and things like that but prior
[3:04] to that she was also having Iron
[3:05] Infusion and also getting blood
[3:08] transfusion I think she was getting it
[3:09] at least once a year amen so this time
[3:13] she got admitted and she told me she was
[3:15] going to have a c scan the pelvic exam
[3:18] x-ray ultrasound blood test and so when
[3:21] I checked on
[3:22] on uh was it
[3:26] wednessday I think it was wednessday or
[3:28] Wednesday she got admitted and then I
[3:30] checked to her and then she said well
[3:31] she's just waiting now for the doctor to
[3:33] come she should be discharged in the
[3:34] morning that's
[3:36] Thursday so I said that's fine amen we
[3:39] brought the pray request to the church
[3:41] then uh she wasn't discharged on
[3:43] Thursday so then in the evening it gave
[3:46] me the opportunity to go to the hospital
[3:48] and pray for her amen and uh so I you
[3:53] know On th on Tuesday I was there with
[3:55] brother at brother Denver's house
[3:57] Wednesday we had church so Thursday and
[3:59] I was looking forward to spending some
[4:00] time with the children amen and you know
[4:02] how they get if you leave them so I told
[4:04] them okay all of you jump in the car
[4:06] they sat in the car while I went up to
[4:08] pray amen
[4:10] so I go up in the room amen just begin
[4:13] to minister scripture to Shantel and
[4:15] there's other patients in the room and
[4:18] uh very simple prayer for some reason
[4:20] Susanna was shantel's daughter recorded
[4:23] the prayer so if you want to hear the
[4:24] prayer it's a very simple prayer very
[4:26] Ash tone not a screaming prayer or a
[4:28] shouting prayer very calm prayer amen
[4:32] but uh someone in Authority who knows
[4:34] the position don't have to shout and
[4:35] scream yes
[4:38] amen so anyway we left her there and
[4:40] then I also in my prayer I prayed over
[4:42] the other patients as well so the next
[4:44] morning they they sent a message on the
[4:46] group and she says the doctors have come
[4:50] back and all of them have been
[4:53] discharged amen
[4:55] now she says that uh there was another
[4:58] lady in the room there
[5:00] had
[5:02] endometriosis she had one ovary removed
[5:05] last or some time ago last year she had
[5:07] a and she was back now because they were
[5:09] going to do further test and they told
[5:11] her that she's got this
[5:14] endometriosis and they're going to
[5:16] probably if the test results come back
[5:17] negative they're going to remove that as
[5:19] well amen but a doctor came in and said
[5:22] all the test results are clear amen and
[5:25] she's discharged as well there's another
[5:27] lady who had a tumor also discharged and
[5:29] she says all of them were in shock even
[5:31] the nurses were in shock because that
[5:33] entire room got discharged am now come
[5:35] on and give him praise
[5:38] amen
[5:41] Lord amen so that's what the power of
[5:43] God can do amen and that's what we are
[5:46] looking for is Bible times back again
[5:49] amen amen we are not preaching these
[5:51] things to educate the people and then
[5:53] not show the proof of it amen so Peter
[5:57] and John amen is typing and like brother
[6:00] brandom says needs to be in every
[6:02] believer the combination and we know
[6:04] that Peter and John is typing love and
[6:06] he's typing Faith but in between is all
[6:09] the other virtues amen so we're looking
[6:11] for a church coming into perfect Faith
[6:13] amen a perfect condition amen and I like
[6:16] amen I was having our prayer night
[6:18] services on awareness day because it's
[6:20] equipping the church amen it's getting
[6:22] the church involved to pray amen amen
[6:25] hallelujah and then brother Joshua was
[6:27] also sharing a testimony amen when we
[6:29] went to pray for his dad he also prayed
[6:32] for another man who was there for a
[6:34] heart attack and he had heart condition
[6:36] and things the family is still in touch
[6:38] with him saying that after he prayed
[6:40] that man is completely well amen
[6:42] completely healed
[6:45] hallelujah amen so we just want to be
[6:48] humble servants of God Amen that can
[6:51] allow his glory to be revealed in us and
[6:55] his power to be revealed in US amen
[6:57] because we can't have word only yes amen
[7:00] amen the prophet says we don't go
[7:01] chasing after signs but he says if we
[7:04] get the word the signs must
[7:07] follow amen so if we had the full
[7:09] opening of the word this church a messy
[7:11] Church can't be a dead Church it can't
[7:13] be a poish church amen we've got to
[7:16] rewrite the book of Acts Hallelujah and
[7:19] if we can just count the testimonies
[7:20] that have transpired amen since last
[7:22] year you'll see the magnitude of it it's
[7:24] not ordinary testimonies amen that's the
[7:27] power of God coming through the church
[7:29] now and you'll see it increase and get
[7:31] greater and greater and greater as the
[7:33] bride comes into full maturity and
[7:35] that's what we are contending for that's
[7:37] what we are laboring for to bring the
[7:38] church to maturity amen and to give God
[7:41] praise amen praise the Lord so we just
[7:43] want to thank him amen for what he's
[7:44] doing amen it's it's nothing Amen to to
[7:47] get puffed up about because remember
[7:49] these things you need to remain in
[7:50] humility amen amen it's just to give
[7:54] glory to God and to testify because
[7:56] these things must be seen amongst the
[7:58] people can you imagine if I'm preaching
[8:01] something and you see no evidence of it
[8:03] and I'm going to be honest with you on
[8:05] Wednesday night when I left home I I had
[8:07] a discourse with the Lord I mean sorry
[8:09] when I went home praying and I said Lord
[8:12] it can't be that in the Bible when they
[8:14] are receiving the Holy Ghost it is
[8:16] Flowing so freely and it seem such like
[8:19] a natural process but yet in the message
[8:21] church it's being preached like you have
[8:23] to know this you have to know this you
[8:24] have to know this but yet 40 years later
[8:26] they know all of these things but no
[8:27] power in the church something is is
[8:30] wrong amen we don't want educated
[8:34] Geniuses so the letter can kill you and
[8:37] brother we were laboring for the for the
[8:39] mechanics brother brandham opened up all
[8:41] the Mysteries now how can we take 40
[8:44] years to preach revealed the
[8:46] Mysteries yes amen the prophet revealed
[8:49] the Mysteries everybody agree that's was
[8:53] his job so can we come week after week
[8:55] to teach you revealed Mysteries
[8:59] something is wrong now we can't like I
[9:01] said there's a sickness uh the the
[9:03] message came to take away our Amnesia
[9:05] but there's a sickness called
[9:07] dementia amen where you can know your
[9:10] identity but sometimes you can forget
[9:12] the next day you find you remember who
[9:14] you are as a son and daughter of God
[9:16] then you get dementia you forget who you
[9:17] are we don't want spiritual dementia yes
[9:20] amen we want a spiritually strong church
[9:22] and I tell you nothing shall be able to
[9:24] stand before you I ask you in any area
[9:26] of your life hallelujah amen amen thank
[9:29] you the body of Christ is on the earth
[9:30] now the angel of God is on the earth now
[9:34] amen and we challenge any sickness any
[9:36] circumstance any any problem that you're
[9:38] going through bring it under the Shan of
[9:40] glory and watch it disappear amen amen
[9:43] amen praise the Lord amen so that's what
[9:45] we are contending for so be in prayer
[9:47] amen when we having prayer services when
[9:49] we having prayer night services amen
[9:51] even if it's all night prayer or we're
[9:52] having special services amen be there be
[9:55] a part of it be equipped with it and I
[9:58] also believe amen that your prayer on
[10:00] Wednesday night also had a major part to
[10:03] do with it amen amen so you are also
[10:06] part of the
[10:07] testimony amen so if you're not in
[10:09] church if you're missing Church you got
[10:11] to get yourself back in
[10:14] church amen you got to get yourself back
[10:16] in church because things are heating up
[10:19] now God is maturing the church and you
[10:20] don't want to be immature you don't want
[10:22] to be left behind where you are not
[10:24] coming in the presence of the sunlight
[10:26] your fruit is still green While others
[10:27] are ripening amen amen so we all want to
[10:30] mature together we want to grow together
[10:32] so that amen God can get the glory amen
[10:35] how many if you want to make the Rapture
[10:37] the body change we are all striving for
[10:39] that amen so we don't want to come so
[10:41] close and then miss it amen let's all
[10:43] Stand Together We Bless The Name of
[10:45] Jesus Amen praise the Lord so I pray
[10:49] amen even as we've been speaking on love
[10:52] Hope and
[10:54] Faith there's some things you need to
[10:57] ponder you know there was a quote going
[10:59] around you know uh voice of God sends
[11:02] out these quotes a daily
[11:05] clip amen you must have read it I think
[11:08] brother s also put it on the
[11:10] group
[11:12] amen I just want to read it because it
[11:15] was confirming what we've been preaching
[11:16] here and now listen to what brother gram
[11:18] is saying here in this
[11:22] message amen Jesus Christ the same
[11:25] yesterday today and forever he says in
[11:27] 20 years of research of the Bible so he
[11:30] has a man who studious and listen what
[11:32] he says next and talking with the angel
[11:35] of the
[11:37] Lord 20 years of Bible research and
[11:40] talking with the angel of the
[11:42] Lord and many things I find here is two
[11:46] things that is love and faith amen amen
[11:51] hallelujah Peter and John love and faith
[11:54] if you love God just purely
[11:56] unadulterated love you've got to have
[11:58] faith in him it'll accompany Faith every
[12:01] time and when love and faith gets
[12:03] married you ask what you want and you'll
[12:06] have it amen so that's our desire the
[12:09] word has been producing Faith but we
[12:11] want love and faith to be joined
[12:13] together yes amen he says when love and
[12:15] faith gets married you ask what you want
[12:18] to and you'll have it when you know that
[12:20] your heavenly father cannot tell you any
[12:22] Lie Is God he can't lie and then when
[12:25] you believe him with all your heart and
[12:27] you believe that what you ask for you
[12:29] ask it not with any selfish motive but
[12:32] your right motive behind there is to ask
[12:34] it for the glory of God and believe
[12:37] without a shadow of doubt that your
[12:39] father won't lie to you something's
[12:41] going to take place when you get all the
[12:43] cockle birs out the way just look
[12:45] straight straight there to Calvary and
[12:47] believe it with all your
[12:49] heart amen so I found that very striking
[12:53] 20 years of research and talking
[12:55] personally with the angel of the Lord he
[12:57] ties it down to two things
[13:00] and that's where the angel has taken us
[13:01] hasn't he been taking us in that in the
[13:03] last few weeks we've been speaking on
[13:04] that so here comes the court now to
[13:06] confirm it amen praise the Lord so let's
[13:09] just lift up our hands amen even as we
[13:11] invite our amen our brother Joshua to
[13:13] come to share the word of the Lord you
[13:15] be under
[13:16] expectation amen you beond expectation
[13:20] whatever your need is whatever your
[13:21] desire is if you
[13:23] want the Holy Ghost if you're saying
[13:26] Lord I want a greater portion of the
[13:28] Holy Ghost if you're saying Lord reveal
[13:30] yourself more to
[13:32] me maybe you're unwell in body maybe
[13:35] you're going through a financial need
[13:36] maybe you're going through a personal
[13:38] problem maybe your family is in
[13:41] distress maybe you're trusting God for a
[13:43] partner in life maybe you're trusting
[13:45] God Amen to help you in your exams
[13:47] whatever it is this morning you know
[13:49] your needs let's present it before the
[13:51] Lord while the word is being
[13:55] preached you present your needs before
[13:57] the Lord

[19:39] body of Christ amen it's the body of
[19:42] Christ that is on work on the earth amen
[19:44] amen each one has a different part to
[19:46] play in the body but all are fly framed
[19:50] into this body amen each one has a
[19:52] different Ministry one each one has a
[19:53] different gift but we all make up the
[19:56] same body amen and each one got a might
[19:59] have a unique uh way of operating in the
[20:01] body but you got to find your position
[20:04] amen because you can't operate outside
[20:07] the body you got to operate within the
[20:08] confin of the body of Christ it's the
[20:10] mystical Body of Christ it's the book of
[20:13] Acts in continuation
[20:14] amen so for scripture reading this
[20:17] morning we'll turn to the book of second
[20:20] Timothy second
[20:23] Timothy chapter 1:
[20:27] 7 second Timothy 1: 7 amen praise the
[20:31] Lord for God had not given us the spirit
[20:34] of fear yes
[20:37] amen but of power amen and of love and
[20:42] of a sound
[20:45] mind so once you got fear you don't have
[20:49] power you don't have love and you don't
[20:53] have a sound mind amen amen but God has
[20:58] not given us that spirit of fear yes it
[21:00] is not for his
[21:02] children amen yes amen it wasn't so in
[21:07] the beginning yes when God created his
[21:10] son on the earth when Adam was on the
[21:12] earth he wasn't Walking In Fear yes amen
[21:16] fear came when he sinned that now he
[21:18] could he wants to be fearful and hide
[21:20] from the presence of God because he
[21:22] recognized it a sin yes amen but apart
[21:25] from that he looked forward to his
[21:27] father coming down every evening to have
[21:30] fellowship with him a and when God would
[21:33] go down he would looking he was looking
[21:34] forward to have fellowship with his son
[21:37] but on that day on that evening when he
[21:39] wants to go and have fellowship with his
[21:41] son his son was not available for
[21:45] him
[21:47] amen we also turn quickly to the book of
[21:49] one John before we take our seats 1 John
[21:52] 4:8 to 20
[21:58] 1 John 4:
[22:01] 8-20 he that loveth not knoweth not God
[22:06] for God is love amen in this was
[22:10] manifested the love of God toward us
[22:13] because that God sent his only begotten
[22:16] son into the world that we might live
[22:19] through him hearing his love not that we
[22:23] love God but that he loved us and sent
[22:27] his son to to be the pro propitiation
[22:31] for our sins beloved if God so loved us
[22:35] we ought also to love one another amen
[22:38] amen no man had seen God at any time if
[22:42] we love one another God dwelleth in us
[22:46] and his love is perfected in US amen so
[22:49] God's love can only be perfected through
[22:52] his body which is the bride of
[22:55] Christ amen hereby no know we that we
[23:00] dwell in him and he in us because he had
[23:05] given us of his
[23:07] Spirit yes thank you that's the evidence
[23:10] amen and we have seen and do testify
[23:14] that the father sent the son to be the
[23:17] savior of the world whosoever shall
[23:20] confess that Jesus is a Son of God God
[23:23] dwelleth in him and he and he in God and
[23:27] we have known and believe the love that
[23:29] God add to us God is love and he that
[23:33] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[23:36] in him amen herein is our love made
[23:40] perfect that we may have Bish in the day
[23:44] of judgments see love gives you this
[23:47] confidence amen because as he is so are
[23:51] we in this world so we must reflect his
[23:55] very image amen his very characteristics
[23:58] there is no fear in love
[24:02] but perfect love casteth out
[24:06] fear because fear at torment he that
[24:10] fearth is not made perfect in love we
[24:13] love him because he first loved us if a
[24:16] man say I love God and hated his brother
[24:18] he is a liar for he that loveth not his
[24:21] brother whom he had seen how can he love
[24:24] God whom he had not seen and this
[24:26] commandment have we from him that he who
[24:30] loveth God loveth his brother also amen
[24:33] you may be seated
[24:39] amen just for a little title this
[24:41] morning we'll speak on the bride of
[24:44] Christ ministering in love and power
[24:48] amen amen the bride of Christ
[24:51] ministering in love and power for the
[24:52] subtitle we call it Satan will be
[24:54] powerless before the bride amen amen
[24:57] amen hallelujah
[24:58] so this bride is ministering in love and
[25:01] power amen
[25:03] amen you know the prophet says when
[25:05] Divine love has been projected and come
[25:07] to its end its destination Sovereign
[25:10] Grace will take over amen
[25:14] amen The Book of Luke chap 10:19 says
[25:18] behold I give unto you power to tread on
[25:23] serpents and
[25:25] scorpions and over all the power of the
[25:28] enemy me and nothing shall by any means
[25:31] hurt you so you see this power is given
[25:36] it comes because of inheritance
[25:38] amen it comes because you are part of
[25:41] him he can't give this power just to
[25:44] anybody amen God's love come down amen
[25:48] through Jesus Christ yes that he can be
[25:50] the savior of the world to redeem back
[25:52] man to the original condition and that's
[25:55] why he says now I give unto you power
[25:58] because man has lost that he lost his
[26:00] first state amen he lost his condition
[26:03] that he was in because he lost titled
[26:05] did in the Garden of Eden but Power had
[26:08] to come back to man yes cuz man had to
[26:11] come back to his original condition but
[26:13] what brings the power down is the love
[26:15] of God Amen because of his love towards
[26:18] us he wants to restore back man to his
[26:21] original condition in a condition where
[26:24] you will walk in perfect love in a
[26:27] condition you will have no me he will
[26:29] not walk in fear Amen in a condition
[26:32] where he walks having dominion over the
[26:35] Earth over every circumstance that he
[26:38] face in his life he has dominion over
[26:41] it he works as one with
[26:44] authority amen so we find that when in
[26:49] this day when we receive this word amen
[26:51] it comes to reflect and show us back
[26:54] what our true identity is amen because
[26:57] in our true identity we recognize our
[26:59] true Authority amen but sometime it was
[27:02] lost amen we had Amnesia yes we
[27:05] suffering from spiritual Amnesia but the
[27:07] opening of the word comes down the shout
[27:09] comes down with a message what to wake
[27:11] us up out of Amnesia
[27:14] amen amen to make us recognize who we
[27:18] truly are what's our purpose on the
[27:21] earth we have a Divine Purpose on the
[27:24] earth you have you have normal human
[27:27] beings on the Earth and people have
[27:29] purposes people are career driven and
[27:31] Purpose Driven but our purpose is a
[27:33] Divine Purpose it's from the Eternal
[27:36] thoughts of
[27:38] God Amen our purpose were pre was
[27:42] already predestinated by God
[27:46] Amen so Luke 10:19 says behold I give
[27:50] unto you power to tread on Serpent and
[27:52] scorpions and over all the power of the
[27:54] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[27:57] hurt you yes
[28:01] John 14:2 says and that day ye shall
[28:04] know that I am in my father and ye in me
[28:07] and I in you
[28:10] amen there must come a
[28:13] time where you have to
[28:16] recognize the oness the unity amen that
[28:19] God Christ was so much displaying the
[28:22] father amen amen he he come he said the
[28:25] son can do nothing by himself but what
[28:26] the father shows him yes amen he was in
[28:29] such a Oneness amen and this Wess must
[28:31] dwell must come into the bride where she
[28:34] become so in tune with Christ in such
[28:36] wonders with him amen amen that if you
[28:38] see her you see him yes amen there was
[28:43] nothing less of seeing him that's why he
[28:44] said Philip I've been so long with you
[28:47] and you have not seen me when he said
[28:49] show was the father amen so there must
[28:52] be such a Harmony between Christ and the
[28:56] bride but this bride is ministering in
[29:00] Divine love
[29:02] amen Colossians 3:14 says and above all
[29:05] these
[29:06] things put on charity which is the bond
[29:10] of perfectness amen
[29:14] amen so we know one of the attribute the
[29:18] main the core attribute of Christ is
[29:20] what love amen amen that Christ when we
[29:25] look at when we look at our people's
[29:28] failures we look at him through the
[29:32] human eyes but when God looks at it
[29:35] that's why he's giving you parables in
[29:36] the Bible like the prodal son and so
[29:38] forth he's showing you a person going
[29:40] down to their path to their Journey but
[29:43] he's also showing you the end results
[29:45] amen amen that's why he said to Jeremiah
[29:49] I know the plans I have for you plans to
[29:52] prosper you plans to give you an
[29:54] expected end am amen
[29:58] so you look at your life and you look at
[30:00] your life's journey and you look at your
[30:02] failures along the
[30:04] way by your carnal
[30:06] nature but when the Holy Spirit comes
[30:09] down and when you receive the new birth
[30:11] and you start to look at into the eyes
[30:13] of God's word you now to try start to
[30:16] look at your life through the word and
[30:18] see what the word says about you amen
[30:22] amen the word shows you that you are
[30:25] being redeemed back to an original
[30:27] condition amen the word is showing you
[30:29] that you have to come to be the sinless
[30:32] Spotless
[30:33] bride the word shows you that you are to
[30:36] be the judge of the Earth the word shows
[30:38] you that you are going to be the one
[30:39] that will inherit the earth amen the
[30:42] word shows you that you are coming back
[30:43] to Dominion
[30:45] again the word shows you that you'll
[30:47] have power over every deadly thing
[30:49] nothing shall by no means harm you amen
[30:52] yes
[30:53] amen the word shows you that you can
[30:57] take every divice promise of God and you
[30:59] don't have to take every negative word
[31:01] said by your doctor every negative word
[31:03] spoken by your employer every negative
[31:05] word by your bank balance you can take
[31:08] what the Divine Promises of God says
[31:10] amen yes he says to you I am Jehovah
[31:13] Gyra to you I am Jehovah Rafa to you I
[31:16] am Jehovah Shalom your god of peace to
[31:19] you I am the one that is with you ever
[31:21] present God
[31:24] Amen yes every attribute of God
[31:28] is available to
[31:30] you so how do you look at yourself
[31:32] because this is the hour where the there
[31:35] must be a ministering of love and power
[31:37] yes amen they couldn't have that people
[31:41] were were searching after the
[31:43] power amen people wanted the gifts they
[31:47] wanted the power but they wouldn't
[31:49] operate under Love Now firstly Jesus
[31:52] said if you love me you will keep my
[31:54] words yes amen and my word will not be
[31:58] Grievous unto you yes so you must love
[32:01] the
[32:02] words and the word is
[32:04] Christ and you must become one with the
[32:07] words because you are changing back to
[32:09] the words amen amen and when you are now
[32:12] walking in the word when you're looking
[32:14] at your brother your brother might have
[32:16] fallen down but you're not looking at
[32:17] what he's fallen down but you're looking
[32:19] at him as the sinless Spotless bride of
[32:22] Christ you looking at him the person
[32:24] that's going to be in the Rapture you're
[32:26] going to look at him as the one that's
[32:27] going to have a what he change you're
[32:28] going to see him as the one you can have
[32:30] eternal fellowship with you're going to
[32:33] say this brother is part of me we have
[32:35] the same father we have the same genes
[32:38] where we're in Eternal thoughts of gods
[32:40] because why that is why you can have
[32:42] love towards his brother amen and that's
[32:46] why when your brother has need of
[32:48] something he can have so much of love
[32:51] for you he can have confidence in you
[32:52] that he can come to you and say brother
[32:55] I have need of this and he can have
[32:58] because you are walking in his Divine
[33:00] love amen he can trust you that if he
[33:04] tells you his situation you're not going
[33:06] to go and cheat T to everybody you're
[33:08] not going to look at him in a caral way
[33:11] but you're going to look at him as a Son
[33:12] of God and say brother we know the enemy
[33:15] has come but now the enemy has come to
[33:18] steal and destroy but I've come to give
[33:19] life and give it more abundantly as a
[33:22] Son of God I'm taking this word and I
[33:24] give it to you amen amen amen amen now
[33:29] this is the bride that Satan will be
[33:30] powerless before amen because she is the
[33:33] one that will recognize their position
[33:35] she will recognize their true identity
[33:38] she will recognize the true church amen
[33:40] amen amen that's what he
[33:45] says he says now remember this Christ in
[33:50] the true church
[33:52] yes is a
[33:54] continuation yes
[33:59] of the book of Acts so no way did he
[34:01] take the book of Acts and he and he
[34:04] closes it off amen no way is the book of
[34:08] act closed
[34:09] off but he said is a continuation of the
[34:14] book of
[34:17] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[34:21] how that the Antichrist Spirit would
[34:23] come into the church and defile it
[34:25] making it lukewarm formal and
[34:29] Powerless you see what Satan was always
[34:31] his tactic was make the church
[34:35] powerless it exposes Satan revealing his
[34:40] Works attempted destruction of God's
[34:42] people and the discrediting of God's
[34:45] word how you discredit God's word take
[34:48] out the power take out the scripture
[34:50] that speaks about all the promises of
[34:52] God Amen that belongs to
[34:55] you right down to the time he's pass
[34:57] into the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[35:00] cannot stand it
[35:02] amen listen to this part now he knows
[35:04] that if the people get the true
[35:07] revelation of the true church and what
[35:08] she is not what somebody else
[35:12] is it is good what the apostles
[35:15] was it's good what Jesus did on
[35:18] Earth it's good what brother Brandon did
[35:22] but what she
[35:24] is amen what she's stand for and that
[35:29] she can do the Greater Works John 14:12
[35:34] she will be an invincible Army amen if
[35:38] they get a true revelation of the true
[35:39] Spirits within the framework of the
[35:41] Christian church and by God Spirit
[35:44] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[35:46] spirit and I just telling you that
[35:49] before that Satan wants to make a formal
[35:50] and
[35:51] Powerless now he's telling you you must
[35:54] get a revelation when you see that
[35:56] happening then you know what Satan ising
[35:57] doing yes Satan will be powerless before
[36:01] her amen amen he will be as definitely
[36:05] twed today as when Christ with stod his
[36:08] every effort to gain power over him in
[36:10] the desert yes Satan hates Revelation
[36:15] but we love it amen with true Revelation
[36:18] in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot
[36:21] Prevail against us but we will prevail
[36:23] over them you see now when you are true
[36:26] have a true identity
[36:28] a true revelation of who you truly are
[36:30] what's your purpose on the earth what's
[36:32] your position in Christ when you have a
[36:35] revelation of that then the Gates of
[36:37] Hell cannot Prevail against it because
[36:39] now you know who you are you know why
[36:41] you are placed in this season you know
[36:44] why you save for such a time as this
[36:47] amen when now is the time to utterly
[36:50] slay and Destroy every part of the
[36:52] enemy you leave no squatters behind
[36:55] don't let people squat over your land
[36:58] don't let people squat over your
[36:59] circumstances
[37:01] amen amen what I'm talking about demon
[37:04] powers yes don't let demons come squat
[37:07] over your land amen or your inheritance
[37:10] in this
[37:13] hour every promise belongs to
[37:20] you so he find his the
[37:23] bride when she must be the one
[37:25] projecting Divine love in his hour amen
[37:29] amen she must be the one where the world
[37:32] sees
[37:33] compassion when I'm talking about
[37:35] compassion I mean there's many people
[37:37] going and doing doing good deeds I'm not
[37:39] talking about that type of compassion
[37:42] alone that's good there's nothing wrong
[37:44] to do that that's a good thing to do but
[37:46] I'm talking about compassion when you
[37:48] see a person and you know you have a
[37:50] revelation that we are at the end time
[37:53] the Rapture is about to take place and
[37:55] after we leave the Earth Grace leaves
[37:57] the
[37:58] Earth the gospel got to go back to the
[38:00] Jews we in a final break we in a final
[38:03] hours of the Gentile
[38:04] dispensation and you know that many will
[38:07] be
[38:08] lost so when you look at somebody that
[38:11] is knowing that the soul is going to be
[38:13] lost you have
[38:14] compassion amen amen that's what brought
[38:17] Jesus down Amen to come and die for our
[38:22] sins amen so you have to show grace to
[38:25] the Earth right and you can't do that if
[38:28] you're not walking in Divine love
[38:30] because you have to see it how God sees
[38:32] it you someone might be so wasted so so
[38:36] much in sin so so much gone into the
[38:39] pits of sin but when you are walking in
[38:42] love you see this person and you see the
[38:44] way Christ looks at it amen amen because
[38:47] Christ is being projected through your
[38:49] eyes yes Christ is been projected
[38:51] through your hands amen through your
[38:52] lips amen
[38:54] yes so every word you speaking you

[38:59] that person is a waste of time just
[39:02] leave them they far gone no you speak
[39:05] life yes life and death can come from
[39:09] your mouth amen you have the power to do
[39:11] that Hallelujah because why you are
[39:13] reflecting the sacrificial Love Of
[39:15] Christ yes no one else is going to do
[39:18] that in this
[39:19] hour it's only the bride of Christ the
[39:22] body of Christ that can display the
[39:24] sacrificial Love Of Christ amen amen and
[39:28] is not limited only to words yes amen
[39:32] but is demonstrated to the way we have
[39:35] our service through our brethren we love
[39:38] God by loving each other
[39:41] yes amen and love comes
[39:46] forgiveness amen I'm talking about
[39:49] forgiveness not when you forgive your
[39:50] brother and then you go speak I forgave
[39:52] this brother for doing this to me you
[39:53] know what he did to me but I forgave him
[39:57] no
[39:58] that's not the type of forg that's not
[40:00] Divine love amen amen Divine love when
[40:03] you forgive yes and now you can walk
[40:06] with your brother and say no my
[40:08] brother I take you by the hand as my
[40:10] brother I love you my brother we are
[40:13] finishing this race together amen my
[40:16] brother maybe yes the enemy has come and

[40:20] brother but that is not you you are a
[40:23] son of God and I see you in the perfect
[40:26] image of Jesus Christ
[40:27] I see you as a sinless spotless bride my
[40:30] brother I see you my brother that we're
[40:32] going to finish this race
[40:35] together
[40:36] amen true forgiveness can only come to
[40:39] those that are walking in Christ
[40:42] amen it also bring you to humility amen
[40:46] amen Jesus showed the example of true
[40:48] humility yes he can go to his Brethren
[40:50] the apostles amen he could go to them
[40:53] and show them how to when he's washing
[40:55] the feet what are you teaching them
[40:56] humility
[41:03] amen and that's why you find that love
[41:07] covers a multitude of sins because
[41:10] that's how you overcome yes sometime you
[41:12] might
[41:14] find a situation so messed up but love
[41:18] can cover a multitude of sin because you
[41:21] can overcome to love because he's
[41:24] removing fear amen he's removing hatred
[41:28] and now he's making you think as a Son
[41:30] of God Amen and when you think as a Son
[41:33] of God what you think about you think
[41:35] about Grace you think about what he done
[41:37] for you you think about UNC no
[41:39] conditions to that love amen cuz he died
[41:42] with you died for you with unconditional
[41:43] love amen when you went on a cross every

[43:59] back to operate the word of
[44:02] God and she doesn't compromise on the
[44:05] truth this bread of Christ she doesn't
[44:08] bow down to the pressure of this world
[44:10] Amen yes amen amen if you find a person
[44:14] who don't have the Holy Ghost they will
[44:15] easily compromise they will easily bow
[44:18] onto the prees of the
[44:20] world because why our foundation is on
[44:23] the unchanging word of God the
[44:26] foundation of right the foundation was
[44:29] on the unadulterated word of
[44:31] God the mechanics had to be right

[44:38] we got to do it has to be of healing
[44:41] Deliverance amen all the things that
[44:43] Christ did
[44:45] salvation must be a demonstration of
[44:48] God's power amen there must be a

[45:21] church it must
[45:24] follow it's normal that's the
[45:27] continuation yes of the book of
[45:30] Acts but if if I started on a
[45:34] journey maybe I'm a businessman and I
[45:37] started on a journey in my
[45:40] business and few years ago I was making
[45:42] the thousands of
[45:45] rents then maybe 10 years ago I was
[45:48] making in the millions of rents but now

[45:58] words there must be in my continuation
[46:00] of this business it must go higher there
[46:04] must be more Progressive amen so if we
[46:06] are continuation of having a
[46:07] continuation of the book of Acts it will
[46:10] continue on because Redemption is being
[46:12] revealed and revealed and now it's fully
[46:15] revealed until you're coming now where

[47:12] shall be loose from that bondage amen am
[47:14] yes and when you are walking with
[47:16] anointing it's an anointing that breaks
[47:17] the Yoke of bondage am so your brother
[47:19] is walking in bondage and if you are
[47:21] walking such an anointing it will be the
[47:23] anointing that will break the Yoke of
[47:25] bondage but preach on Wednesday that

[47:41] man can have the anointing yes you don't

[47:47] Prophet Elijah Elisha was dead for a
[47:51] long period of time then they plac
[47:53] another dead man in his tomb the dead
[47:56] man ran out

[48:25] just have to speak one word amen yes and
[48:28] shut the M of the lion hallelujah
[48:32] amen maybe your your employee is trying
[48:34] to put you down you just have to speak
[48:37] one word under the
[48:42] anointing so we call out to live the
[48:44] word of God Amen yes and we find all
[48:48] these things must follow the church amen
[48:50] but the secret to the power of the
[48:52] church is the revelation of who she is
[48:55] yes amen yes amen That's what Satan
[48:59] tried to make a stumble on Satan always
[49:02] tried to keep up back in history Satan
[49:05] tried to keep her back with the things
[49:07] of the past but Satan don't want her to
[49:10] enjoy the benefits of who she
[49:14] is Satan doesn't want her to walk in her
[49:18] own identity amen but when she
[49:22] understands a position in
[49:25] Christ amen we we know that she can
[49:27] never be
[49:29] defeated when she ident understand her
[49:33] identity amen you can't walk around with
[49:35] somebody else's Identity book am I right
[49:39] you're going to do your business you
[49:41] carry your own ID you carry your own
[49:43] identity you don't carry somebody else's
[49:47] identity so when she understands her
[49:52] identity now if my
[49:54] father is a rich man
[49:57] a wealthy man and I walk with my with
[50:01] his identity card it won't help
[50:05] me but if I have the same
[50:08] surname and I walk with my
[50:11] identity and now I've acquired the
[50:14] rights to his business I have to show my
[50:17] identity but I've got his same surname
[50:20] then I can now conduct that business so
[50:24] just like that Christ we know you can't
[50:27] go and use the name of Christ without
[50:30] identifying yourself in amen so when you
[50:33] come to this age now of ad when you are
[50:36] now coming to
[50:38] adoption and you are now able to use his
[50:41] ident use his name amen amen and now you
[50:45] can walk with your own identity because
[50:47] you are recognizing who you are in him
[50:50] yes amen cuz your blessings are in him
[50:53] yes amen and now you can work under your
[50:56] identity because you can now you can now
[50:58] handle the business amen yes amen and
[51:01] you find if you do that you will become
[51:04] Unstoppable amen amen you will become
[51:07] victorious in this end time yes
[51:09] amen that's right Satan has been trying
[51:12] to keep you away from who you
[51:15] are amen but this bride must minister in
[51:18] love and
[51:20] power amen you can't just have power
[51:24] because power without is
[51:28] satanic amen but when Divine love sets
[51:32] in
[51:34] amen Sovereign Grace takes his place
[51:39] amen we find that this bride is not an
[51:41] ordinary group amen because a identity
[51:45] is
[51:46] divine according to Ephesians 1:4 he
[51:49] says according as he had chosen Us in
[51:51] him before the foundation of the world
[51:55] that we should be holy and not blame
[51:57] before him in
[52:02] love so we must be holy and Without
[52:05] Blame before him in love yes so you see
[52:09] our we are not ordinary group but a
[52:12] predestinated
[52:14] group because God chosen us before the
[52:17] foundation of the
[52:19] world and we have this Authority we can
[52:22] Now operate under the authority amen
[52:25] when you now recognize who who you are
[52:27] you recognize your Authority your
[52:29] identity then you are know who your
[52:32] father is yes and when you recognize who
[52:35] your father is you now know that you
[52:38] have a Divine
[52:42] Authority and why you have this Divine
[52:44] Authority because you come into Union
[52:47] the invisible Union of the Bride of of
[52:50] the Earth the Heavenly bridegroom and
[52:51] the Earthly bride you come into a union
[52:54] with him and now you can oper at this
[52:57] Authority because of the
[52:59] Union amen before you didn't have this
[53:02] Authority because you didn't know who
[53:03] you are but now you come with him you
[53:06] you are now have a hup you never had hup
[53:09] before but in this day the edstone has
[53:11] come down amen amen when the church
[53:15] comes up to maturity headship comes down
[53:18] amen yes yes and this church knows her
[53:21] head oh yes and when she recognizes her
[53:23] head she can Now operate through
[53:27] operate Authority because of the Union
[53:29] amen that's why he said many will come
[53:31] in that day and say Lord have I not
[53:33] prophesied in Your Name Lord I not cast
[53:35] demon in name but they didn't come in a
[53:37] union yes they were after the power but
[53:40] they own minister in love amen this one
[53:43] is ministering in love and power because
[53:46] why she's come under the Union Yes amen
[53:50] because now this is a love affair amen
[53:52] this is a love Union amen this is God's
[53:55] the gape love coming down to his bride
[53:58] amen and she becomes so much like him
[54:01] and everything she wants to do is
[54:03] because of her love for him amen amen
[54:05] yes she wants to come and serve him
[54:08] because she loves him not because she
[54:10] just want the power no you know the
[54:13] story of the Seven Sons of ska and so
[54:15] forth how people just wanted power you
[54:18] know the story of the the the prophet
[54:20] people that call themselves prophets
[54:21] toward Nigeria and all over Africa they
[54:24] only want the power
[54:26] but they don't love the
[54:28] word they wouldn't take the word they
[54:30] wouldn't take their unadulterated word
[54:32] yes but he has to come through a union
[54:35] you miss the union you miss the
[54:37] Rapture
[54:39] yes amen because if there's no Union you
[54:41] cannot produce Jesus Christ
[54:45] again so you can have your Authority
[54:48] because of the Union amen so this bride
[54:51] when she recognizes who she is she can
[54:52] now walk and exercise the authority
[54:56] and when you were walking in the
[54:57] authority you don't have to mince your
[54:58] words you don't have to scream you don't
[55:01] have to go to a situation a cancer case
[55:04] and scream yes you can speak to that
[55:06] demon of cancer you can expose that
[55:09] demon that's there because you know
[55:11] where the demon comes from and you know
[55:13] where you come from you know the end of
[55:16] the demon and you know your end that you
[55:18] have an eternal life and he's going to
[55:20] go into the Lake of Fire right amen amen
[55:28] we find
[55:29] that being united with Christ we carry
[55:33] his authority amen the same power that
[55:36] he demonstrated over Satan belongs to
[55:39] the bride John 14:12 says verily verely
[55:42] I say unto you he that believeth on me
[55:45] the works that I do shall he do also and
[55:49] Greater Works than the shall he do
[55:51] because I go unto my father you see
[55:54] Jesus know knew
[55:57] he's telling them that I have to go
[55:59] unless I go you can't have this yes you
[56:02] can't have the authority unless I go
[56:05] because if I'm here I'm the
[56:07] authority but when I go my spirit will
[56:10] come upon you then you can exercise The
[56:12] Authority yes amen and therefore if
[56:15] God's Prophet was here on the scene now
[56:17] then this bride can't take her position
[56:19] because long as God's Prophet was on the
[56:21] scene he was the authority of the day
[56:23] yes amen but now when he's of the seen
[56:27] the authority comes to the church to the
[56:29] body of Christ amen amen because now she
[56:32] come into a union with Christ and his
[56:35] Spirit comes upon her amen and now that
[56:38] is why he says there'll be a refilling
[56:40] of the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost
[56:42] comes to bring forth this church in
[56:45] Authority he brings it to become an
[56:47] operational Church she doesn't become a
[56:49] religious church but she's to be an
[56:51] operational church amen amen she's to be
[56:54] a living body now yes the resurrected
[56:57] body of Jesus Christ again amen amen and
[57:00] he's now what he is drawing Christ out
[57:02] of the scriptures drawing Christ out of
[57:05] History showing that he's the present
[57:07] God
[57:09] amen amen the very god of the Bible the
[57:13] very god of the Apostle the very God of
[57:15] William brandham is here now amongst us
[57:18] amen so ask what you will whatever your
[57:21] situation may be today amen if you
[57:24] believe that God is here then you must
[57:26] doesn't look at your brother and sister
[57:28] as Ordinary People you look at them as
[57:30] Divine people partakers of the divine
[57:32] nature of Jesus Christ and if you are
[57:35] looking beyond the image today you can
[57:37] have you can ask what you will and you
[57:39] can receive it
[57:43] amen you got to recognize where God is
[57:45] working in the hour he working in amen
[57:50] yes because once Satan gets you not to
[57:53] recognize the hour and the way God is
[57:55] working you're going to miss your
[57:56] blessings yes you're going to miss what
[57:58] he has in store for you
[58:01] amen and you find that people that are
[58:03] catching it are enjoying the blessings
[58:04] of God Amen people that are catching it
[58:06] are enjoying all the promises of God
[58:08] Amen because they have the right
[58:10] attitude towards it
[58:13] yes but it got that's why I said you got
[58:15] to do it in
[58:17] love then you enjoy the power
[58:21] amen now we know that Satan was already
[58:24] stripped in Calvary
[58:27] he stripped off his legal rights yes yes
[58:30] and what are the proof of it when he
[58:32] comes down in Revelation 101 in this day
[58:36] when the mighty Angel comes down with
[58:38] the book in his end yes and he showing
[58:40] the legal right is now coming back to
[58:42] the rightful owner amen he's showing now
[58:45] the legal rights must come back to his
[58:47] sons and daughters amen amen he showing
[58:50] them that you are the ones that this
[58:52] book belongs to amen you are the ones
[58:55] that must take of this book oh thank you
[58:57] Lord you are the one who I'm going to
[58:59] reveal to you now and when I reveal this
[59:02] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[59:03] against it I'm going to reveal to you
[59:05] the names in the book I'm going to
[59:07] reveal to you all my secrets and you are
[59:09] going to be the one who have the right
[59:11] now to prophesy again before Nations and
[59:14] tongues because you are the ones who
[59:16] have the right to call out those names
[59:18] in the book amen the lost on you have
[59:20] the right to to prophesy again amen you
[59:23] Lord thank you Lord because it's
[59:24] revealed unto you amen and to you alone
[59:27] amen thank you you become now the
[59:29] authority on the
[59:31] earth amen thank you Lord because why
[59:34] you was prepared to come in Oneness with
[59:36] him you was prepared to come into a
[59:38] union with him not like Vash who turn
[59:42] away the king's call
[59:45] amen but Esther was prepared to come
[59:47] even if it if it meant amen a life being
[59:51] taken away from her she was prepared to
[59:53] come because the love of her people
[59:56] amen and she loved the king as well she
[59:58] also had confidence that she knew the
[1:00:00] king loved her
[1:00:02] amen
[1:00:05] amen so he find that Satan was stripped
[1:00:08] off his legal rights so don't let him
[1:00:10] come lie to you with his little H
[1:00:12] bringing little circumstances in your
[1:00:14] life
[1:00:15] right don't let him lower you to speak
[1:00:18] his
[1:00:20] language don't let him lower you to
[1:00:22] speak the negative thoughts yes because
[1:00:25] he's just lowering you you are partakers
[1:00:27] of a divine nature amen
[1:00:30] yes your language is a Heavenly language
[1:00:34] amen your language knows no fear amen
[1:00:38] your language is walking in perfect love
[1:00:41] it casts way it Cast Away all fear your
[1:00:44] language Works in confidence in your
[1:00:46] father's promises amen amen because you
[1:00:50] find that Colossians 2:15 says and
[1:00:53] having spoiled principalities and Powers
[1:00:56] he made a show of them openly triumph
[1:01:00] triumphing over them in it amen so we
[1:01:04] find the Bride As the continuation of
[1:01:06] Christ on Earth enforces this Victory
[1:01:10] amen as the continuation of Christ as
[1:01:13] the body of Christ we must enforce this
[1:01:15] victory that he triumphed over Satan
[1:01:18] over every power over every demon power
[1:01:21] over principalities amen amen no demon
[1:01:24] power must ever rulership over the
[1:01:26] bribes yes no demon power has the right
[1:01:29] to bind any son and daughter of God
[1:01:33] Amen they must flee from the children of
[1:01:35] God amen amen
[1:01:37] yes we find that you know people give
[1:01:41] Satan a lot of accolades in this world
[1:01:46] but you know Satan's power is limited
[1:01:49] right Satan has an expected end the
[1:01:52] Bible speaks about it
[1:01:54] yes amen
[1:01:57] we know what's going to happen to Satan
[1:01:58] eventually Satan and his demons are
[1:02:00] going to be cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:02:03] El was created not for us not for human
[1:02:06] beings I was created for Satan and his
[1:02:08] agents
[1:02:10] yes so he has an expected end yes his
[1:02:14] defeat is already declared in the Bible
[1:02:17] yes but you'll find that Satan's power
[1:02:20] is now remember the Satan's power is
[1:02:23] effective but it's only effect
[1:02:27] when the bride doesn't exercise her
[1:02:29] Authority yes and he was having a jaw
[1:02:32] ball of a
[1:02:34] time because after the prophet left the
[1:02:36] Earth the prophet was causing chaos on
[1:02:37] the earth his ministry was causing chaos
[1:02:40] in Satan's kingdom yes but when he Lees
[1:02:43] the scene and while the bride was
[1:02:45] getting ready while the bride was
[1:02:47] receiving the word receiving the
[1:02:49] word Satan was going on a
[1:02:52] rampage but now in the hour where the
[1:02:54] bride is recognized their position she
[1:02:57] recognizes her Authority
[1:03:00] amen and now she's able to exercise The
[1:03:04] Authority then Satan becomes ineffective
[1:03:08] yes his power becomes
[1:03:10] ineffective but in the places where the
[1:03:14] bride wouldn't exercise The Authority
[1:03:15] his power will be effective that is
[1:03:18] going to bind people that is going to
[1:03:19] hold him in
[1:03:21] bondage but when the bride now is
[1:03:24] exercising her Authority because it's
[1:03:26] good to say I am the bride I am the
[1:03:28] Invincible
[1:03:30] Army I have all power given to me I it's
[1:03:33] good to say all that but unless you
[1:03:35] operate in this power you exercise in it
[1:03:37] you exercise in this authority of the
[1:03:39] word then only Satan become powerless
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:43] amen when you start to do it when you
[1:03:46] start to go out to pray for the sick
[1:03:48] when you start to go in speak into
[1:03:50] situations amen when you start to open
[1:03:53] your mouth because you must prophesy
[1:03:54] again amen don't the the word to
[1:03:56] yourself hear it from your ears never
[1:03:58] Echo it one day from your
[1:04:00] mouth you hearing all the word but not
[1:04:04] one day you're professing it from your
[1:04:05] mouth when you start to exercise The
[1:04:08] Authority yes Satan's ability become
[1:04:13] ineffective
[1:04:16] amen Satan because he works through
[1:04:20] deception That's what Satan does col 2
[1:04:22] Corinthians 4:4 says in whom the God of
[1:04:25] this world had blinded the minds of them
[1:04:28] which believe not lest the light of the
[1:04:30] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:04:32] image of God should shine unto
[1:04:38] them and Ephesians 4:30 says and grieve
[1:04:40] not the holy spirit of God whereby you
[1:04:43] are sealed until the day of redemption
[1:04:45] so we know that the blood of Christ is
[1:04:48] already sealed until the day of
[1:04:49] redemption amen but he comes to attack
[1:04:51] you to make you think to make you have I
[1:04:55] identity crisis yes he comes to attack
[1:04:58] you to think whether you already saved
[1:05:00] and got your going to your Eternal
[1:05:01] destination but if you are sealed it
[1:05:03] means you already sealed to your Eternal
[1:05:05] destination yes nothing can prevent you
[1:05:07] from going to that destination yes amen
[1:05:11] so you can't touch the bride because
[1:05:12] she's sealed by the Holy Ghost until the
[1:05:15] day of redemption

[1:05:22] and give you an identity crisis yes
[1:05:25] comes to give you a mental breakdown
[1:05:27] amen it plays on the five on your senses
[1:05:29] on your five senses it plays on your the
[1:05:33] conscious and so forth your memory your
[1:05:35] all those things your spirit he plays on
[1:05:37] your body he tried to bring sicknesses
[1:05:39] in he tries to do all it but he can't
[1:05:42] come to the soul amen it can't come to
[1:05:46] the soul so you got to bring the body
[1:05:47] now in line to the soul amen yes amen
[1:05:50] you got to bring the body under
[1:05:52] subjection you got to have dominion over
[1:05:54] the body amen amen you got to exercise
[1:05:57] your Authority amen and bring it in line
[1:05:59] yes
[1:06:01] amen
[1:06:06] amen now they has to be an anointing in
[1:06:08] this end time for this bride that's why
[1:06:11] God had to anoint you in his hour you
[1:06:13] could have been anointed in a day where
[1:06:16] they were fed to the Lions burnt at the
[1:06:20] Stak fought with Gladiators and so forth
[1:06:23] you could have been anointed for the
[1:06:25] where you would reform but you are
[1:06:27] anointed for this age amen you are
[1:06:30] anointed for the time where all H is
[1:06:32] Unleashed on the earth yes you are
[1:06:34] anointed for the time when deception is
[1:06:36] on the earth deception is so high that
[1:06:39] it will deceive you to believe that you
[1:06:40] are in a comfort zone believing that you
[1:06:42] are going because you are saved you
[1:06:44] receive the message of the hour but as
[1:06:46] long as he got you not to exercise your
[1:06:49] Authority not to bring that word
[1:06:52] effective in your life then you are not
[1:06:54] ministering in love and Power amen
[1:06:56] because if you are ministering in love
[1:06:58] and power because you have so much of a
[1:07:00] love for him then you will recognize
[1:07:01] what you got to do in this hour amen
[1:07:03] that you love your father so much that
[1:07:05] you got to carry out his business in his
[1:07:06] hour wasn't Jesus at the temple when he
[1:07:09] was 12 yes sir and Mary and Joseph on
[1:07:12] their Journey started looking for him
[1:07:14] and then Mary came and said don't you
[1:07:15] know your father is looking for you he
[1:07:17] said don't you know I'm about my
[1:07:19] father's
[1:07:20] business amen because in his mind was
[1:07:23] the mindset you know he had a
[1:07:26] mandate and when you come to love your
[1:07:28] father and you know the mind the Mandate
[1:07:30] that you have on this Earth that you
[1:07:32] have to beat That Body of Christ the hch
[1:07:35] is down in the to but the hch can't do
[1:07:38] nothing without the
[1:07:39] body amen we have received in the hour
[1:07:42] the body couldn't do anything without
[1:07:43] the head yes and the head can't do
[1:07:45] anything without the body but the head
[1:07:48] is sending the signals to the body but
[1:07:50] the body needs to function
[1:07:52] yes but if the body now is in life
[1:07:56] with the head in such love amen then
[1:07:58] she'll be ministering in love and
[1:08:02] power
[1:08:06] amen amen Satan hates to get exposed he
[1:08:09] hates this time when the bride can
[1:08:10] exercise her Authority he don't like
[1:08:12] people to
[1:08:13] say I am now taking this scripture and
[1:08:16] I'm going to use it now in this hour he
[1:08:18] like you to pick on somebody else they
[1:08:20] did it sometime in the past he like you
[1:08:22] to speak about a bygone testimony
[1:08:25] but he don't want to give you a present
[1:08:26] day testimony amen sometimes he make you
[1:08:30] ashamed to say your own testimony
[1:08:32] because why he doesn't want you to
[1:08:34] exercise your
[1:08:37] Authority Romans 8:19 says for the
[1:08:39] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:08:40] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[1:08:43] of
[1:08:43] God there was there was a waiting amen
[1:08:47] there was a groaning there was a
[1:08:49] travailing waiting for this
[1:08:51] hour where sons of God will come to the
[1:08:53] maturity and be manifested on the earth
[1:08:56] amen hallelujah because why demon power
[1:09:01] were polluting the Earth demon power
[1:09:03] destroying the
[1:09:05] Earth but now that the sons of God on
[1:09:08] the earth they have to exercise The
[1:09:11] Authority the same Authority that Christ
[1:09:14] exercised when he was on the earth the
[1:09:16] same Authority that he gave Satan's
[1:09:18] kingdom a hard time when he was on the
[1:09:22] earth this bride must continue that yes
[1:09:25] because Revelation 1978 says let us be
[1:09:27] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[1:09:29] for the marriage of the Lamb is come yes
[1:09:32] and his wife and made her ready amen now
[1:09:37] nobody goes no bride groom goes to dress
[1:09:41] up their
[1:09:43] wife maybe he would have presented the
[1:09:46] the money for the wedding and so forth
[1:09:49] yeah the Garment was given to us yes
[1:09:51] amen yeah he gave us the Garment but you
[1:09:54] have to take the Garment
[1:09:56] you have to fit into the Garment you
[1:09:57] have to make yourself ready amen you
[1:10:00] have to come into the conforms of the
[1:10:02] word amen you have to make yourself
[1:10:05] ready yes amen he said for
[1:10:09] she his wife had made herself
[1:10:18] ready now our Authority don't come on
[1:10:21] our own thoughts he don't don't come on
[1:10:23] our own ideologies our own ideas our own
[1:10:26] Doctrine our Authority comes from the
[1:10:28] word of God and that hasn't changed amen
[1:10:31] we don't add to the word we don't take
[1:10:33] out from the word our Authority lies
[1:10:35] upon the word of God Amen the Holy
[1:10:38] Spirit comes to align us with the word
[1:10:41] and when you find that this bride her
[1:10:42] Authority comes from the complete
[1:10:44] Reliance on the word of God what the
[1:10:46] word says about her what the word wants
[1:10:49] her to do in this hour
[1:10:51] amen we find that Jesus demonstrated
[1:10:54] that in Matthew 4:4
[1:10:56] when Satan was tempting him he said man
[1:10:58] shall not live on bread alone but by
[1:11:00] every word that proceeded out of the
[1:11:02] mouth of God and therefore that
[1:11:04] everything that we do we follow the word
[1:11:06] of God yes therefore you can't have
[1:11:09] power without love
[1:11:11] yes Jesus said that very clearly a lot
[1:11:14] of people want the power he said if you
[1:11:15] love me you will keep my word now it's
[1:11:18] not easy for people to keep the word
[1:11:19] because they're not in the
[1:11:21] union but when you are when you are in
[1:11:23] the union you're nature your makeup
[1:11:26] everything is part of him remember the
[1:11:29] gene of God is in you
[1:11:31] amen there was a stage where you thought
[1:11:33] you just born to Earthly parents but
[1:11:36] there was another stage where you come
[1:11:38] to the realization of who you truly
[1:11:42] are amen that you no longer the Son and
[1:11:45] Daughter of so and so but you're a son
[1:11:47] and daughter of God Amen that your
[1:11:49] brother sitting next to you he is a son
[1:11:51] of go of God your sister sitting next to
[1:11:52] you she's the daughter of God
[1:11:56] so every time we're claiming the
[1:11:57] promises of God what we doing we are
[1:12:01] reminding Satan of his defeat you know
[1:12:02] that every time you claim a promise
[1:12:05] because the promises only came when
[1:12:07] Jesus died on the cross he defeated he
[1:12:09] stripped Satan of his rights on Calvary
[1:12:12] so every time you're claiming the
[1:12:14] promise do you know that you're
[1:12:15] reminding Satan of the defeat you know
[1:12:18] when you're claiming your healing you
[1:12:19] know Mind by his stripes we were
[1:12:23] healed every time you're claiming
[1:12:25] something your salvation is because of
[1:12:27] the blood of Jesus Christ your atonement
[1:12:30] every time you come you bring a sinner
[1:12:31] to the Cross you a sinner to the altar
[1:12:34] amen when a sinner is coming to the
[1:12:35] altar you're reminding Satan of his
[1:12:37] defeat yes that he has no rightful
[1:12:39] claims over you amen you think Satan's
[1:12:42] got a grip on you no he's lying to you
[1:12:45] he's only squatting on
[1:12:47] you he doesn't have the legal rights
[1:12:51] Christ has the rightful claims over you
[1:12:54] you are Christ purchased possession he
[1:12:56] purchased You by his own
[1:12:59] blood
[1:13:01] amen we know Satan's end Revelation 210
[1:13:05] says and the devil that deceived them
[1:13:06] will cast was cast into the lake of fire
[1:13:09] and brimstone where the Beast and the
[1:13:11] false prophets are and shall be
[1:13:13] tormented day and night forever and
[1:13:16] ever
[1:13:18] amen but this church what he said that
[1:13:22] he might present it to himself a glor
[1:13:25] glorious church amen yes not having spot
[1:13:28] or wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:13:31] should be holy and without blemish amen
[1:13:34] so we find this let me give you this
[1:13:37] last one more quote
[1:13:40] here now to show you our love is
[1:13:43] projected this you might laugh at this
[1:13:46] it's true as I'm standing here one time
[1:13:48] I was out in the field when I was a game
[1:13:50] warden and there had been a bull and
[1:13:52] killed a colored man okay you know the
[1:13:55] story there he comes there and he speaks
[1:13:57] about this bull now we get to the main
[1:13:59] part of the
[1:14:00] story so he's saying there was a killer
[1:14:02] bull right and I got close to him and he
[1:14:04] raised up and he was a killer I looked
[1:14:07] back to the fence it was too far for me
[1:14:09] to run so he was now in a position now
[1:14:12] where he couldn't even run and he was so
[1:14:14] close to me there was no tree for me to
[1:14:16] get into it well I thought this is the
[1:14:18] end I can't go no further for if I try
[1:14:22] to run you will catch me so what can I
[1:14:24] do now that's when we come to this
[1:14:28] crisis and that's when Sovereign Grace
[1:14:31] steps in then something
[1:14:35] happened in my life that I wish it would
[1:14:38] if it ever comes again that I'll never
[1:14:41] leave and I only wish that there was
[1:14:43] some way that I had the power this
[1:14:45] morning to project this to this group of
[1:14:47] men and women here and it will never
[1:14:49] leave you like when the maniac up at
[1:14:53] Oregon when when he began when he ran to
[1:14:56] the platform to kill me many of you read
[1:14:59] the read that book something happened
[1:15:01] there you often wondered I guess how
[1:15:04] those things happen it's something in
[1:15:07] instead of despising that man though he
[1:15:10] was there to take my life a Divine love
[1:15:13] set in for him and he called me a
[1:15:17] hypocrite and a snake in the grass and
[1:15:19] thousands of people sitting there and
[1:15:21] spit in my face and Drew back his fist
[1:15:24] and said I'll break every bone in your
[1:15:26] body people probably sitting there
[1:15:28] sitting here was there but instead of
[1:15:31] despising the man something grace came
[1:15:35] in and in a moment when I needed it
[1:15:37] Grace sets in and projected a Divine
[1:15:40] love into my heart that I could project
[1:15:43] to him and thought there stands a man
[1:15:46] like a man like I'm he likes to eat and
[1:15:48] drink and his family but the devil has
[1:15:51] him bound you see ministering in love
[1:15:55] what happened now you try to see a man
[1:15:57] in his normal position
[1:15:59] amen so the love of God constrained me
[1:16:02] and the man humbled himself and fell
[1:16:04] across my feet Grace stepped in When
[1:16:07] Love Was projected amen and in the case
[1:16:10] of this bull trying to kill me he got
[1:16:12] got up on his feet I looked at and
[1:16:14] looked at me and snorted three or four
[1:16:17] times and throw his horns into the
[1:16:18] ground I looked around and there was
[1:16:20] nothing and as an officer I was I was
[1:16:23] supposed to pack a gun and I wondered
[1:16:26] why I didn't have it you see now we try
[1:16:29] to think about our normal what we can do
[1:16:31] to our to protect ourselves in the flesh
[1:16:34] and I would would have killed the bull
[1:16:37] and then went and paid for it but I had
[1:16:39] no gun god seemed to e that I had no
[1:16:44] gun so sometime you put in a situation
[1:16:46] and you wonder why you are there and and
[1:16:49] you and you try to help yourself but you
[1:16:50] find that you couldn't do the things
[1:16:51] that you wanted to do to help yourself
[1:16:53] because sometime God allows that to
[1:16:55] happen amen so he wanted to show his
[1:16:58] divine grace in a crisis hour so
[1:17:00] sometime you might be in a crisis hour
[1:17:02] but God sometimes want to show his
[1:17:04] divine grace
[1:17:06] amen and something struck me way better
[1:17:10] than a gun or any weapon of this world
[1:17:12] it was the divine grace that took my
[1:17:14] heart and thinking of that animal wanted
[1:17:17] to live the same as I wanted to live and
[1:17:19] instead of hating him as he was planning
[1:17:22] to take my life I loved him that sounds
[1:17:25] juvenile but it's the
[1:17:27] truth and as he rushed towards me I said
[1:17:31] creature of God is's a man back in his
[1:17:34] Adam condition
[1:17:35] amen back man back in his original
[1:17:38] condition I am the servant of God I'm on
[1:17:41] a legit legitimate call to a man who's
[1:17:44] dying and our creator has sent me and
[1:17:47] I'm sorry disturb to disturb you out of
[1:17:50] your rest but in the name of he who
[1:17:53] created us both go go over and lay down
[1:17:56] under the tree now he man back in
[1:17:59] Dominion again instructing the animal
[1:18:00] what to do and when he got so close to
[1:18:03] me within 10 ft I was no more scared of
[1:18:06] that animal than I would be of my
[1:18:08] brethren here this
[1:18:10] morning come Divine love perfect love
[1:18:14] cast out all fear and he stopped he just
[1:18:17] looked so depleted he took both ways
[1:18:20] turned around walked over and lay down
[1:18:22] under that tree and I walked in there
[1:18:25] walk in three feet three feet of him
[1:18:28] pass by through the field safely When
[1:18:31] Love is projected Divine Sovereign Grace
[1:18:34] of God takes a hold that's what happened
[1:18:37] to okay you see what happens yes so he's
[1:18:40] showing you the situation now something
[1:18:42] got over him Divine love took over
[1:18:46] amen so one more
[1:19:06] can I give you a
[1:19:16] second don't have to my
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:22] notes put myot up second
[1:19:30] one okay I got

[1:19:36] the
[1:19:38] bottom God hat a powerless religion yes
[1:19:42] it's got to be power certainly it's a
[1:19:46] power to save a man from sin it's a
[1:19:49] power that can do signs and wonders and
[1:19:50] miracles as Jesus Christ promised they
[1:19:53] zeroed in on the word of God back there
[1:19:56] and believe it and hit the target you
[1:19:58] zero the same way on the word of God it
[1:20:01] will hit the target again it's got to
[1:20:04] because it's the same yesterday today
[1:20:06] and forever God don't like a powerless

[1:20:33] ends of the world the works that I do
[1:20:35] shall you do

[1:21:08] amen you love him this morning amen amen
[1:21:12] he said God doesn't like a powerless
[1:21:15] religion amen God wants to demonstrate
[1:21:18] his power he's a supernatural God I
[1:21:20] don't know why people are afraid of the
[1:21:21] supernatural when his sons and daughters
[1:21:24] they are partakers of a divine nature
