[0:00] prayer. Amen. How many of you ready for
[0:01] the word?
[0:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's empty out our cup so we
[0:05] can fill in. Amen. Now, remember, we've
[0:07] been teaching a bit and going on a
[0:09] series, so we'll just take off from
[0:10] there. Amen. So, we'll turn to our
[0:12] Bibles. We'll go to Revelation chapter
[0:13] 10. Praise the Lord.
[0:20] We started on Sunday. We Amen. continued
[0:22] on Wednesday. We just take it a bit
[0:24] further today. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[0:27] Now pray amen that the Holy Spirit will
[0:29] make things more clear for us.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; So that we can recognize our day and our
[0:35] message.
[0:37] Praise the Lord.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; So Revelation chapter 10, we'll read
[0:42] from verse one. There it says, "And I
[0:44] saw another mighty angel come down from
[0:47] heaven clothed with a cloud." Now we
[0:51] must know if we are in the message of
[0:52] the hour that that mighty angel was
[0:54] Christ.
[0:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that was Christ
[0:56] descending. Amen.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; He says only Christ that could be
[0:59] &gt;&gt; right. And he's coming with that open
[1:01] book. Remember he's the same one in
[1:03] another form. Took that book.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; When it was in the hand, Amen. of the
[1:08] one seated on the throne. He came out of
[1:09] the sanctuary. He took that book and now
[1:12] he's bringing this title deed back to
[1:13] the earth.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we got to identify this angel
[1:17] &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven clothed with a
[1:19] cloud. Now we know that the cloud was
[1:21] seven angels.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon is saying seven angels
[1:25] formed that cloud. Amen.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; So he's being clothed. He's surrounded
[1:28] by seven angels.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; And a rainbow was upon his head. So now
[1:33] he's a covenant angel.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; We know rainbow speaks of covenant. And
[1:37] his face were as it were the sun and his
[1:39] feet as pillars of fire. And he had in
[1:42] his hand a little book open. And he set
[1:45] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:48] foot on the earth and cried with a loud
[1:51] voice. Now he's got a message. The
[1:53] messenger, any angel has a message. So
[1:56] this messenger has a message. He cries
[1:59] with a loud voice as when a lion roarth.
[2:02] But now his message is tied to something
[2:04] else. He says, "And when he had cried,
[2:06] seven thunders uttered their voices."
[2:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the seven thunders had
[2:11] uttered their voices, I was about to
[2:13] write. So he didn't write anything. He
[2:15] was about to write.
[2:17] And I heard a voice from heaven saying
[2:19] unto me, "Seal up those things which the
[2:21] seven thunders uttered and write them
[2:23] not." Amen. Praise the Lord. The Lord
[2:25] had blessings to the reading of his
[2:27] word. You may be seated.
[2:29] Amen.
[2:37] So we've been saying that if we can't
[2:39] recognize our day and its message, our
[2:41] time and our season, we won't know how
[2:43] to prepare adequately for the time that
[2:45] we are living in now. Yes.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; Right. The bride has had a revival.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; The bride is not looking for a coming
[2:52] revival.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; The opening of the word is our revival.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; So these are the things we ought to be
[2:58] excited about.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a revival should not we
[3:01] shouldn't allow a revival to die. We
[3:03] were speaking on Wednesday about the
[3:05] Welsh revival.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; We baron says once a revival passes you
[3:10] can't bring it back.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; So the 1904 Welsh revival has passed.
[3:15] But the point we were trying to make
[3:17] that the revival could not be seen
[3:19] physically with eyes. The revival in
[3:22] fact the man was standing next to the
[3:23] person where the revival was in and he
[3:25] asked him where's the revival
[3:27] &gt;&gt; and he said I am the Welsh revival.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; So people are looking for now remember
[3:32] the Pentecostals had a revival under
[3:34] Isuza Street
[3:36] &gt;&gt; and they were the revival was in there.
[3:39] Now, if we are in this time and season
[3:41] looking for a revival, we as the bride
[3:43] must say, "This is the bride's revival.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; I am the bride's revival."
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've got to have a fire shut
[3:51] up within our bones.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to be excited about what
[3:55] we believe.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; We've got to be enthused about what we
[3:58] believe.
[3:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, the then we were trying
[4:03] to show Amen. how that there came a time
[4:06] in brother Brandham's life when him as a
[4:10] seven church age messenger his ministry
[4:12] had completed.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Now if you go to Revelation chapter 2
[4:17] you'll see the the Lord the angel is
[4:20] telling John to write unto the angel of
[4:22] the church of Ephesus until the angel of
[4:24] the church of Smyrna until the angel to
[4:27] every angel he must write. Amen.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; So unto the angel of the Ladyians,
[4:33] that's William
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Brham.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; Write to him.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; So the seventh angel has a message.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Now watch if we go to our first quote
[4:43] there, brother Josh. He says, "Now
[4:45] watch, don't forget this now as we go.
[4:48] But in the days of the voice of the
[4:50] seventh angel, so he's trying to
[4:52] describe who the seventh angel is. He
[4:54] says that last angel, earthly angel.
[4:59] Then he says this angel. Now remember
[5:03] he's he's drawing the distinction
[5:04] between Revelation 101 angel and 107
[5:07] angel. Now he's talking about 101 angel.
[5:10] He says this angel came down from
[5:12] heaven. It wasn't him.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; He come from heaven. Right? So that is
[5:17] speaking in the first seal. Then we'll
[5:20] go to the next quote there and we'll see
[5:21] this is now in the in
[5:24] he says this angel come down from
[5:26] heaven. The other seven angels of the
[5:30] seven churches was earthly messengers.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; But this angel all the message is
[5:36] finished. The seventh angel winds up the
[5:38] whole thing.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; So what is he trying to say? Late year
[5:41] is now over.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Pentecost is over.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Time for a new message.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; Time for now to call out the bride.
[5:48] Amen.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He's been building up
[5:51] the pyramid, building up the church.
[5:52] Amen. Restoring the bride. But now, how
[5:55] excited heaven must be?
[5:57] &gt;&gt; How excited are we on the earth? Amen.
[5:59] Because now there's a message for an end
[6:01] time people to welcome back Christ on
[6:03] the earth.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; So he says the seventh angel winds up
[6:08] the whole thing. And this angel comes
[6:10] not to the earth. He isn't a man from
[6:12] the earth as the messengers to the
[6:15] church ages. That's finished. But this
[6:17] angel brings the next announcement.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; This angel is coming for marriage.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; This angel is coming to unite with a
[6:27] people.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; This angel is coming now to bring
[6:29] present tense conditions on the earth.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He brings the next
[6:34] announcement. And an angel means a
[6:36] messenger.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; So which means his message is not come
[6:40] out of all my people.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of a sin. That's
[6:44] William Brandham's message. Amen.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. This angel is not going to rebuke
[6:49] them and talk to you about their
[6:50] dressing.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; This angel is That's the seven church
[6:53] age message. Amen. That's his message
[6:55] telling them you're blind. You are
[6:57] wretched. You're poor. You are naked.
[6:59] Why don't you come and buy yourself?
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the seventh angel's
[7:03] message.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; That's directly from the Bible.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; So he's warning them, dress right, live
[7:08] right, act right, do right
[7:11] &gt;&gt; because Christ is coming.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; So he says here
[7:18] an angel means a messenger and he comes
[7:21] down from heaven clothed in that pillar
[7:23] of light cloud with a rainbow over his
[7:26] head and a rainbow is a covenant. It was
[7:29] Christ.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; So here he is confirming Revelation 10:1
[7:33] angel he is Christ.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:39] With one foot on land, one on sea and
[7:41] swore time will be no more. Where are we
[7:44] at, sir? What What's all this about? I'm
[7:47] asking you. The other angels were
[7:49] messengers, men of the earth. But this
[7:51] angel
[7:52] &gt;&gt; to the angel of the church of ladies
[7:54] here, to the angel of the church of
[7:56] Ephesus, messengers of the earth, men,
[7:58] messengers, prophets, and so forth come
[8:00] to the church. But this one didn't come
[8:03] from the earth.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; He come down from heaven because the
[8:06] mystery is all finished.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; If we're still wondering what the
[8:10] mystery is, the mystery was finished.
[8:13] The seventh angel went off the earth,
[8:15] but it's time for the mighty angel.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; And when the mystery is finished, the
[8:29] angel said, "Time shall be no more." And
[8:31] seven thunders throw their voices out.
[8:34] What if it is something to let us know
[8:35] how to enter into rapturing faith?
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Is it?
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; I say yes.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; Will we run?
[8:43] Leap over walls. That means to leap over
[8:46] walls means to change dimensions. Amen.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Is there something fixing to happen and
[8:50] these old wild bodies are going to be
[8:52] changed.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the message. Amen. To
[8:56] change our bodies.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, if you put up the first
[9:02] picture on that slide there, I'll show
[9:04] you the seven church age messengers of
[9:06] the earth.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; These are men of the earth.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; You can trace where they were born. You
[9:12] can trace Paul. He's called Paul of
[9:15] Tarsus. You can trace his earthly mother
[9:18] and father.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; All of these men had earthly mothers and
[9:23] fathers.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; These were earthly men given messengers.
[9:26] Ireneius.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can see Martin, Columba,
[9:30] Luther came out of Germany. Wesley came
[9:32] out of England. Brother Brandon came out
[9:34] of the USA.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; These are all earthly messengers.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; If you search up the history on
[9:42] Wikipedia, you can read about these men.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you go to Revelation
[9:48] 2:3, you can read about these men.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; These men had messengers through the
[9:54] church ages. God has been building up a
[9:57] church.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; And these were the messengers to those
[10:00] churches.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Now listen how fortunate we are, church.
[10:04] The Bible says to write to the angel of
[10:06] the church of Ephesus doesn't give his
[10:08] name.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; But we sitting here today in 2025 can
[10:12] put a name to the angel of the church.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the pyramid has been
[10:18] built up.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; We are all the way at the top now.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; We can look back down through the ages
[10:24] and see how God has been working
[10:26] building up the church.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you imagine living
[10:29] in Paul's age? You wouldn't have known
[10:31] all the other messengers to come. But
[10:33] here we are right at the top now with a
[10:35] big eye view. Amen. We can look down
[10:37] through the church ages and see how God
[10:40] was working. Jesus Christ the same
[10:42] yesterday, today, and forever. When
[10:44] Satan thought he had defeated the
[10:46] church, God still had a people coming
[10:48] through. God still had a message for
[10:50] each age.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Now, let me show you the one that was
[10:54] not from the earth. Amen. Put up the
[10:55] next picture. These are the earthly
[10:57] seven, but this one is a heavenly
[10:59] messenger.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the Bible says this one
[11:02] didn't come from the earth. He came down
[11:04] from heaven. That's Jesus Christ. He's
[11:07] here. He is the messenger.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. For those of you looking for
[11:15] the rapture, the rapture has already
[11:17] started.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are already in the
[11:21] shout. Amen. We are already caught up.
[11:23] We are already translated. Amen. We are
[11:26] already caught up in our portion of the
[11:28] word.
[11:30] Praise the Lord.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; People are looking and saying, "Oh,
[11:33] we're waiting, waiting, waiting." What
[11:34] are you waiting for?
[11:35] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be in the cycle of
[11:37] you're not waiting for it.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's why we are
[11:42] revived. That's why there's a joy in our
[11:43] soul because the heavenly messenger is
[11:46] on the earth now.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. This one, you
[11:52] can't find his father.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; The other seven churches, you can go to
[11:56] Wikipedia and find his father and
[11:57] mother.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you put up Hebrews chapter 7
[12:00] there.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 7 maybe verse three.
[12:06] Praise the Lord.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; Oh glory. We'll find out where his
[12:10] father and mother is.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Without father
[12:15] &gt;&gt; without mother,
[12:17] &gt;&gt; without descent, having neither
[12:19] beginning of days nor end of life, but
[12:21] made like unto the son of God, abided a
[12:24] priest continually.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This is God Almighty
[12:29] come down for what? For marriage.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's come to unite with the
[12:34] church. But there's only a special class
[12:36] of people called to unite with the
[12:38] headstone.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Paul wasn't called to unite with the
[12:40] headstone.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Ireelius wasn't called to unite with the
[12:43] headstone. Neither were the seven church
[12:45] age messengers called to unite with the
[12:47] headstone because the headstone must
[12:49] come and unite with a living people.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; So don't think that you are just a
[12:55] casual observer in the message. You are
[12:57] called here to meet the headstone to
[13:00] match the headstone to fit so perfectly
[13:02] with the headstone.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[13:06] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. We are just not
[13:08] ordinary people on the earth.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were perfectly designed. Amen.
[13:12] Do you know when Solomon was building
[13:14] the the temple, they had stones cut from
[13:16] all around the world.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; And they play brought them to Amen. the
[13:21] city of David there. And they placed
[13:24] them out and there was no cutting. He
[13:26] says there was not a sound of a buzz
[13:27] saw,
[13:28] &gt;&gt; not a sound of chisel, no cutting.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; It was perfectly cut.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; All they were doing was fitting and
[13:34] fitting and fitting. We have been cut
[13:36] for an end time age. Amen. We were not
[13:38] caught for the Pentecostal age. We were
[13:40] not cut for any other age. We were cut
[13:42] for the bride age. Amen. At the end of
[13:44] all time,
[13:46] &gt;&gt; in fact, they wouldn't have known what
[13:47] to do with your peace if they saw your
[13:49] peace in the other ages.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; They would have left you aside like they
[13:53] left that headstone, the cornerstone.
[13:54] They left him aside. They didn't know
[13:56] what to do with it.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You were not built for
[14:00] another time and season. You were not
[14:02] built to be thrown to lions. You were
[14:04] not built to go through persecution, to
[14:06] be sword as thunder. You were called to
[14:08] rise above the the conditions of this
[14:10] age. Amen.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Brandham says here in
[14:18] the message influence, he says, I must
[14:21] decrease.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He must increase.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So watch how you got
[14:28] your levels.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; When you are setting your levels between
[14:33] I must decrease and I must increase.
[14:36] Watch who you got bigger.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; If you have the seventh angel as as the
[14:41] increase and the the Revelation 10:1
[14:44] angel as a decrease, something is wrong
[14:45] with your picture.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "I must decrease."
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he must increase.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; God can't have two on earth at the same
[14:57] time.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to give you straight from
[15:04] the court. So, you can't say I am
[15:05] telling you something.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; The plan himself is preaching it. But
[15:08] these things are overlooked.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; The deity teaching came into the message
[15:15] &gt;&gt; and people look more to the man
[15:17] &gt;&gt; and forget the one that is here.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; I'll say this again. If you want Brother
[15:25] Brandham as your seven church age
[15:26] messenger, then you're still stuck in
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Leia.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; He is a messenger to the latest.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; I am not a Leosian.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; I am not a Leian. Neither am I a bread
[15:40] might.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; My name is Jesus.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Call me Jesus.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; That's my married name.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you can go up to any
[15:51] demon and tell them, "I come in the name
[15:53] of Jesus. My name is Jesus. That's my
[15:56] married name." Amen. You've got to leave
[15:58] in the name of Jesus.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Watch now. He says,
[16:07] "God can't have two on the earth at the
[16:09] same time. Only one has the message."
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Only one has the message.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; You know, I must decrease. He is the
[16:20] messenger.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; I've been up to this time. Now, if you
[16:28] if you got the pyramid there, you can
[16:29] put it up. Amen. He says, I've been up
[16:32] to this time.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Right
[16:36] now, he takes my place.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Okay, leave that quote there. Let's
[16:40] let's just read this. I've been up to
[16:42] this time. Now, he's talking about the
[16:43] seven church age later this year. I've
[16:46] been up to this time. Then he says, "Now
[16:48] he takes my place."
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; I know some of you don't want to read
[16:53] this.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Some of you don't want to read this.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; He takes my place.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; As Elisha, when Elijah went up and
[17:05] throwed back his robe to Elisha, his
[17:07] ministry was finished. Elisha must must
[17:10] take up where he left off. He must
[17:13] increase. I must decrease. Is quoting
[17:15] John the Baptist. So he says be
[17:17] conscious of your littleness.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; You are nothing.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; I wish you had a mirror in front of you
[17:24] so you can tell yourself I am nothing.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; I am nothing.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's any good to be found in
[17:30] me, it is Christ in me, the hope of
[17:33] glory.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. It's not me that doeth
[17:37] the work. If I go up to a brother and I
[17:38] cast out that demon of sickness, if I
[17:40] cast out something, Amen. It's not I
[17:42] that doeth the work, but the father that
[17:44] dwelleth in me. Amen.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; He's saying you sound like you're
[17:51] speaking like in the first person like
[17:52] you're Jesus. Well, that's what it's all
[17:54] about.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; In that day you shall know as I was in
[17:56] the father, the father in me, I in you,
[17:58] you in me?
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Somebody give him praise.
[18:03] Amen. Somebody give him praise.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't Jesus say, Amen. The next
[18:07] quote, brother. Didn't Jesus say in the
[18:09] last days, Matthew 24:24, that the two
[18:12] would be so close it would deceive the
[18:14] very genes predestinated, the elected
[18:16] ones, if it was possible.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; You see, my genetics, you know, there
[18:20] are certain genetics that are uh are
[18:23] prone to receive sicknesses and
[18:25] diseases.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; But this genetics,
[18:29] &gt;&gt; wonderful,
[18:30] &gt;&gt; it has an immune system that can resist
[18:33] deception. My God,
[18:36] &gt;&gt; my immune system is built to resist
[18:38] deception,
[18:39] &gt;&gt; to resist the lie of the devil.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. What he's saying here, he says the
[18:44] predestinated, the very genes
[18:46] predestinated elected ones, if it was
[18:48] possible, they can be deceived. But I'm
[18:50] designed in such a way that I can't be
[18:52] deceived.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; The virus of deception comes and my body
[18:57] rejects it. My soul rejects it.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[19:02] He says almost. It looks almost like the
[19:05] real thing. So in the last days, it's we
[19:07] time now.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; It's getting harvest time. This is not
[19:11] Luther's age. This is not Pentecost age.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; This is not the Pentecostal age.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; What is he saying it is?
[19:23] &gt;&gt; It is the bride's age.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[19:31] As Moses called a nation out of a
[19:33] nation, Christ today is calling church
[19:34] out of a church. You see the same thing
[19:36] in type, taking them to the glorious
[19:39] eternal promised land.
[19:42] Amen. He says now to refuse that person
[19:45] that's doing the calling,
[19:47] Christ,
[19:49] &gt;&gt; no matter if you're Pentecostal,
[19:51] Methodist, Luther, whatever you are, you
[19:53] got to this age, nothing against them,
[19:55] not at all. But in this age now, you've
[19:57] got to accept like they did in that age,
[19:59] the person of Christ, which is the word.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I must clarify something here. It's
[20:06] so close that sometimes in the days of
[20:08] William Brandham, Luke 17:30 was in
[20:11] operation.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; This mighty angel that came down needed
[20:15] a body to walk through.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; So, he he used the body of William
[20:20] Brandham. Amen.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; So, you're going to hear the mystery of
[20:24] God that the that last age message for
[20:26] the bride is coming through this
[20:27] prophet.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; But he's using that body.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; He's using that vessel.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; But you can't confuse who the messenger
[20:36] is.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Now, in this time and season, the body
[20:41] of William Brandom is in the grave.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; His soul is in heaven.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; It is the orphan body. Yes.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; But then the mighty angel must find
[20:50] another group of people to tabernacle
[20:53] and walk through.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:55] [Applause]
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Hear what he says. Now the next one,
[21:05] according to God's word, the seventh
[21:07] messenger will finish. The seventh
[21:09] message will be finished. And then the
[21:12] seventh Sunday.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; And he saw the capstone rolled over.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So which means
[21:19] brother if you put up the picture of the
[21:21] pyramid there
[21:26] you'll see here.
[21:29] What is he saying there? So the seven
[21:32] thunders can't come in the legacy in
[21:33] church age.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; If you put up the picture you put up on
[21:38] Wednesday. This one doesn't have the
[21:40] headstone. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[21:46] The seven thunders are coming
[21:48] out of the headstone.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Now, the headstone is a very special
[21:52] place.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; It's a very special ministry for a
[21:55] special class of people.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; That's the eagle age.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; That's the heavenly places.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; That's where the bride is caught up now.
[22:06] The bride was caught up. Amen. out of
[22:08] the lady in church age she was the shout
[22:11] came forth to call her into the
[22:13] headstone.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Now many people don't want to take this
[22:18] responsibility to be in the headstone to
[22:20] welcome back Christ on the earth.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Because it requires you to die to
[22:26] yourself.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Civilingum surname needs to die
[22:32] &gt;&gt; and you need to take the surname of
[22:34] Jesus.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So no matter what you
[22:39] are, you got to come to that state where
[22:40] brother Brandham says, "I am not the son
[22:42] of Charles and Ella Brham."
[22:45] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? You are denying
[22:48] earthly
[22:49] &gt;&gt; lineage.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; And you're tying back to your heavenly
[22:52] lineage.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; And you're saying, "My father is God."
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Let's move on now.
[23:07] So Ephesians 1:10 is calling.
[23:11] He says if you're putting it down,
[23:12] Ephesians 1:10 is not a dispensation,
[23:15] not the seventh day. It's called the
[23:17] fullness of time.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; When the fullness of time has come, when
[23:21] that time has been fulfilled, when there
[23:23] is no more time, then you go into
[23:25] eternity after the seven church age is
[23:27] over.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; So what he's saying, Luther's age is
[23:34] over. Methodist age is over. Pentecost
[23:37] age is over.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; So which means then what? Now you're
[23:41] going into what? So you mean we are in
[23:42] the blending of time to eternity?
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because if you're wondering where
[23:48] we are right now.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; If you're thinking that all things are
[23:51] continuing in the same brother Brandon
[23:53] fell asleep, you are sorely mistaken.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; We are in the time in the time right
[23:57] now. The blending
[24:00] &gt;&gt; of time to eternity.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; We are caught in between. Amen. We are
[24:04] caught into heavenly places. We are
[24:05] caught up into the shout. Amen. We are
[24:07] caught up in this place now waiting the
[24:10] translation of our bodies. What are we
[24:12] waiting for then?
[24:14] &gt;&gt; We are waiting just for the last one to
[24:16] come into the headstone.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; We are waiting for the last one to come
[24:23] into the headstone.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Because if you put up the pyramid again,
[24:27] Amen.
[24:29] This age couldn't be finished till
[24:31] everyone that was everyone that was
[24:33] called in godliness was there.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; The age couldn't end till everyone that
[24:41] was called under that age.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Under Wesley's age was in there.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Then the age could be sealed.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; And then starts 1906.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; Then the age could open up. Yes.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Then the seventh church age couldn't end
[24:56] till everyone that was called under the
[24:57] seventh angel
[24:58] &gt;&gt; was in.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Now that we up in the headstone,
[25:03] &gt;&gt; the rapture can't take place till
[25:05] everyone that's called up to be in the
[25:07] headstone.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; Because the headstone is not complete
[25:10] without every single one that's supposed
[25:13] to be there predestinated to be in the
[25:14] headstone.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; And we are praying that there just maybe
[25:20] one or two more pieces. one or two more
[25:23] people to be caught up into the
[25:24] headstone.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; And it could be that they're not out in
[25:28] the world.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; It could be that they are in the message
[25:31] of the hour, but they're caught up with
[25:32] a Ladyian thinking and a Ladyian
[25:34] mentality, not realizing that they are
[25:37] supposed to be all the way up where
[25:38] Christ is.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:46] So how many of you are reading this and
[25:49] you are you are finding out the
[25:50] Pentecostal age is over according to
[25:52] brother Brandon
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal age is over now you go into
[25:55] eternity he says Christ has again
[25:58] centered himself like that cap of the
[26:00] pyramid so whereas Christ centered
[26:03] himself
[26:05] now remember that's just a picture and
[26:07] an illustration so that's why he's
[26:10] saying Christ has centered himself like
[26:12] the cap
[26:14] &gt;&gt; like that picture you are seeing.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Christ has centered himself.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Justification, sanctification, baptism
[26:24] of the Holy Ghost, then the coming of
[26:26] the cap. What is it? The Holy Ghost
[26:28] bunch being honed out. Horned means
[26:31] shaped,
[26:34] &gt;&gt; right? So it can fit with the same kind
[26:37] of ministry he had when he went away.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Now, that puts a big obligation on you
[26:43] and I.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:45] Are you listening to what the prophet is
[26:46] saying?
[26:47] &gt;&gt; We must match the kind of ministry Jesus
[26:49] had when he went away.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; When he comes back, it'll catch the
[26:55] whole thing in the rapture where the
[26:56] justified, sanctified, the and baptism
[26:59] of the Holy Ghost. That pyramid will
[27:01] stand again. The house of God will live
[27:03] again. The tree of life is growing
[27:05] again.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; He says, you get it? Those people who
[27:08] died in there are depending, waiting on
[27:11] us.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. through seven church ages they are
[27:14] waiting on us.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you had to go into that sixth
[27:18] dimension right now and ask them what
[27:20] are you waiting for? They'll say I am
[27:22] waiting on you.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; So this church has got to come to
[27:29] perfection.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Now perfection is only in Christ. Come
[27:32] on. Can we say amen to that? So which
[27:34] means we need to get into Christ.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; This church has got to come into
[27:38] perfection in order to bring the
[27:41] resurrection. Amen.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; And they under sold under the altar
[27:50] waiting for the church to come to its
[27:52] perfection that when Christ does come.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; And this church you see is coming
[27:59] smaller into the minority.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it says there
[28:04] brother Brham refers to his chalkboard
[28:07] drawing right. It's a whole lot sharper
[28:12] than this. But just like to write that
[28:15] across here, it comes to a needle point.
[28:19] So, put up that other picture there that
[28:20] we had on the Are you seeing what
[28:22] brother Brandon is saying here? It's a
[28:24] whole lot sharper, right? But just like
[28:27] to like to write that cross there. It
[28:29] comes to a needle point. Now, pay
[28:32] attention to what he's saying now
[28:34] because the diagram we have is not a
[28:37] correct diagram.
[28:39] He's saying right here at the top,
[28:41] &gt;&gt; it's not a flat surface.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal age doesn't end in a
[28:46] flat surface like that.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; There's a people who have been called
[28:49] out of Pentecost.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; He says it comes to a needle point.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Remember, you can't use cement
[28:59] to put the capstone on there.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; He says it's got to fit so perfectly.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; It's got to be owned.
[29:07] H O N E D.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; That when it comes, it fits perfectly
[29:12] where you can't even fit a razor blade.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; So, what is going to
[29:19] blend Jesus Christ and the Legacy and
[29:22] Church Age?
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; What is the group of people
[29:28] that must fit in between them? Didn't we
[29:31] just read the Holy Ghost bunch?
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Did we put that quote up just now? the
[29:36] one before that. Did you not see that?
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Now, if
[29:41] maybe I'm going slow down a bit.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you if you if you'll
[29:47] just see that he says it's the Holy
[29:48] Ghost bunch, right?
[29:50] How many of you can see the Holy Ghost
[29:52] bunch being honed out
[29:55] &gt;&gt; so that it can
[29:57] &gt;&gt; so which means between the latestans and
[29:59] Christ coming there's a group of people.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:06] that's being honed out to a needle
[30:08] point.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; To welcome the coming edstone. Are we
[30:12] reading correctly?
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Now we can see. Pay attention to this
[30:15] quote. I wish we had two screens so we
[30:18] can put two side by side because now if
[30:21] you put back the pyramid picture,
[30:24] not this one, the other one.
[30:28] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham, this is not
[30:34] the picture that brother Brandham had in
[30:36] the church. You know, in between brother
[30:38] Brandon got Holy Ghost that between
[30:40] brotherly kindness and love.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Now, can you see that the that Holy
[30:44] Ghost is the Holy Ghost bunch
[30:51] &gt;&gt; because you're going to see I'll show
[30:52] you a diagram just now how the pyramid
[30:54] really looks.
[30:57] It doesn't end on a flat surface like
[30:59] that.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Because if the headstone comes, it can
[31:03] slide off.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; And God's not going to use any cement.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to that quote now.
[31:14] We'll read it again. Not this one. We
[31:16] were reading in Statue of Perfect Man,
[31:19] paragraph 368. Amen.
[31:22] And this church you see is coming
[31:24] smaller into a minority. It's a whole
[31:26] lot sharper than that.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon is talking about that
[31:30] flat surface. He's saying, "No, no, it's
[31:31] a whole lot sharper than that. It's a
[31:34] whole lot sharper than that because it's
[31:36] come up to a needle point."
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Up the church in the minority. He
[31:45] has got to get into a place until it's
[31:48] the same kind of ministry that this left
[31:50] because when this headstone comes back,
[31:52] it's got a little pocket like here,
[31:58] the pocket. Now, it's got a pocket that
[32:00] it can fit into. Now, let's let's uh
[32:02] read this very slowly, right? Go back
[32:04] one paragraph.
[32:08] How will we put the headstone? How will
[32:10] we put Jesus Christ coming back? Brother
[32:13] Brandham is giving it away here. He says
[32:17] it comes to the needle point until the
[32:19] church in the minority has got to get
[32:21] into the place it's the same kind of
[32:23] ministry
[32:25] &gt;&gt; that this left.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; You see how we get to the needle point.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; We can't make statements we at the
[32:31] needle point where the needle point then
[32:33] we don't match the ministry.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; He is saying we come to the needle point
[32:37] when we match the ministry of Jesus
[32:39] Christ.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:43] Everybody is clear with that.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; That's how we are being honed, shaped.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; We must match the ministry of Jesus
[32:50] Christ.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Right. It's coming in the minority to
[32:54] get into that place until it's the same
[32:55] kind of ministry that this left because
[32:58] when this headstone comes back, it's got
[33:00] a little pocket like here where it's
[33:02] going to sit right in there on the
[33:04] regular pyramid. It isn't just a cap
[33:06] that sits across the top.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother Brand. I'm saying it now.
[33:10] It isn't just Amen.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; It isn't just a cap that sits across the
[33:17] top. It's a little flange.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; How many of you know what a flange is?
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Have you seen a flange?
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Who here knows what a flange is?
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's got a flange.
[33:33] It must fit perfectly in the flange so
[33:35] it can't slide off.
[33:41] It's got to sit on there cuz it sheds
[33:43] the water.
[33:45] Praise the Lord.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; And when it comes, this church has got
[33:48] to be honed. All these rest the stones
[33:51] of the pyramid are laying so perfect
[33:53] till you can't run a razor blade between
[33:55] them weighing tons laying in there. How
[33:57] they got them up, they don't know. But
[34:00] but they were built.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; And up here when the pyramid cap does
[34:03] come, the pyramid itself, the body of
[34:06] Christ will have to be honed. Amen.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Not only just some creed or doctrine or
[34:12] something. You see what he's saying? Not
[34:14] just straightening out your creeds and
[34:15] your doctrines.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Not just straightening out your
[34:19] guardian,
[34:21] &gt;&gt; but you got to match Jesus Christ.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[34:32] Not just let's read. Brother Brandon, I
[34:34] help you. How many of you believe the
[34:35] prophet?
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[34:36] &gt;&gt; because we get so excited we don't have
[34:38] their creeds and their dogmas.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; He's saying not just that,
[34:43] &gt;&gt; not just some creed or doctrine or
[34:45] something other we come through. It'll
[34:48] have to be so perfectly like
[34:55] &gt;&gt; amen.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Till when he comes, he and that ministry
[34:58] will fit right smack together.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Then will come the rapture, the going
[35:05] home.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; So I say we at the pinnacle now
[35:09] &gt;&gt; where this ministry is matching Christ.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; And next will come the rapture.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Time to go home.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Which what what we mean is the when we
[35:19] saying the rapture which means the dead
[35:20] in Christ must rise
[35:21] &gt;&gt; because the rapture is already in
[35:23] progress with a shout
[35:24] &gt;&gt; calling us out. We are talking about the
[35:26] next phase of the rapture which is the
[35:28] calling out of the dead in Christ.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:39] Amen.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Let's put that next uh picture up. Amen.
[35:49] Praise the Lord. So, let's put that
[35:50] pyramid picture up. So, what he's saying
[35:52] now on that PowerPoint, remember what
[35:56] he's saying? It's not a flat surface
[35:59] like that,
[36:00] &gt;&gt; right? What did he say? It's got a
[36:02] flange.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know if you read that, you
[36:05] remember that. Now he said it's got a
[36:07] flange.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[36:10] So the headstone really looks like the
[36:13] next picture.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Because this is the flange.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Remember he said it must come to a
[36:21] needle point.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; So this becomes the flange where when
[36:28] the headstone fits it can't slide.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Hey, you're paying attention.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:35] Some of you want to go back to Leia.
[36:38] I can see you sleeping.
[36:41] Hey, that's a legian spirit.
[36:45] Imagine if eagles sleep medall.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; If you're sleeping, you lay to see
[36:57] &gt;&gt; blind and miserable. So the headstone,
[37:00] it's got a little pocket like here. Are
[37:02] we reading what the prophet said?
[37:06] &gt;&gt; You know what happened to that that
[37:07] plane in India? The engines went,
[37:11] it went off.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; You know, recently there was a plane
[37:14] that
[37:15] &gt;&gt; crashed.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We don't want you to crash midway
[37:19] through the service.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; We've been born for an eagle age.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; By an eagle prophet's message.
[37:28] This headstone it's got a little pocket
[37:31] like here.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; This is directly the prophet now just
[37:39] that nobody drew the diagram properly.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You all can say amen to that.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; So which means the pyramid really looks
[37:49] like the next one.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because the church has got to be
[37:56] honed.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; The church has got to be owned. So which
[38:03] means we look more like capstone.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; But we are not called capstone.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; We are called top stone.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me you're a top stone.
[38:19] Okay. When we read the quote and you see
[38:21] the prophet saying with the top stone,
[38:23] then you're going to say, "Okay, I can
[38:24] say it." You don't believe your pastor,
[38:28] you want to see it in black and white.
[38:30] It's fine.
[38:32] So, the church has got to be honed.
[38:35] It's a little flange.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; That's how we must finish. Needle point.
[38:44] Did we just read all of this?
[38:46] &gt;&gt; It's not just flat. Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; The church that's called out must come
[38:50] to meet the headstone. How are we
[38:52] meeting him? By doing the same ministry
[38:54] like him.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Are we making sense to the message?
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Are we understanding the message?
[38:59] &gt;&gt; So which means if we are not matching
[39:01] his ministry, we are nowhere near there.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All we're doing is
[39:06] quoting we have we have the right
[39:08] doctrine. We have the right message. We
[39:09] have this. He's saying it's not just the
[39:11] doctrine.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this is what the
[39:18] pyramid should look like.
[39:21] Why did brother Brandon draw it like
[39:22] that? That's where he is. Seven church
[39:24] age message
[39:27] &gt;&gt; ended.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; But we living in this day
[39:31] &gt;&gt; means we can update the picture a bit
[39:34] &gt;&gt; according to what he said.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Using his words
[39:38] &gt;&gt; saying the church is going to be honed.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; It's a little flange.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the authorized people.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; There's no one more qualified or
[39:49] authorized to do it.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Because the headstone must fit
[39:56] perfectly. You can't use cement. You
[39:58] can't use any other glue.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; It must fit perfectly.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're doing good for time.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:09] So he says, I have referred to this. I
[40:12] don't know whether I ever did it at the
[40:14] tabernacle or not. You notice the dollar
[40:16] bill, that great seal, how you could say
[40:18] the United States could recognize that
[40:21] over in Egypt they have a great seal.
[40:23] And here's a seal of the United States
[40:25] one side the eagle. Why would they be
[40:27] forced to make that great seal, the
[40:29] great seal? Because if you notice right
[40:31] behind up above the pyramid, there's a
[40:33] little block. And that little block is
[40:35] the headstone. And that headstone was
[40:37] never put on the pyramid. It's an open
[40:40] top. If you ever been there, now you see
[40:44] why he's saying the headstone is not put
[40:46] on the pyramid. But when we look at the
[40:48] pyramid, we think it's a complete
[40:50] pyramid.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; But what we are seeing is the needle
[40:52] point.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. Come on.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; What we are seeing on the pyramid in
[40:58] Egypt is the needle point. And we think
[41:00] that's got a capstone.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the capstone was
[41:03] never put on the pyramid.
[41:12] I got a little pyramid top here. You
[41:15] see? You think this is the pyramid?
[41:19] &gt;&gt; This is the capstone.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; It must fit.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Fit.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; So it almost looks like the pyramid is
[41:32] coming on top of pyramid.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:38] It must fit. What is that? The marriage
[41:40] of the lamb.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; The two becoming one.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Revelation 19:7. The marriage of the
[41:45] lamb is come.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; His wife had made herself ready.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; The wife must fit and match.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; She must be clothed in the wedding
[41:54] garment that he sent for her.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; The word of God.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; So she comes up now standing there on
[42:00] that seventh step. You remember he says
[42:02] at the seventh step, there's a messenger
[42:04] to welcome you into the king's chamber.
[42:06] That was now our Eliza working among us
[42:09] to our king Christ.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; The coming of the headstone. By the way,
[42:15] you can make this automate this for me.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; It's easy to do this. Amen. You can make
[42:20] it with paper. Praise the Lord. Maybe
[42:22] they should do this in Sunday school.
[42:24] Make some pyramids for us. Praise the
[42:27] Lord. But this is the coming of the cap.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Now, if you put it over a flat surface
[42:32] like this, she can move.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Can you see?
[42:37] That is why brother Brandham is saying
[42:40] they didn't know what to do with the
[42:41] cornerstone.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; It wasn't fitting. It was sliding off
[42:45] everything.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; But in this time and season, there's a
[42:50] people designed to match it.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; To match Christ.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Why? Through the word we receive.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; It's an open top. If you ever seen it,
[42:59] by the grace of God, there's no top on
[43:01] the pyramid. What is it? Enoch built it
[43:04] before the flood. Even that they don't
[43:06] know.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Do you know only you know that Enoch
[43:08] built that pyramid?
[43:10] &gt;&gt; They don't know Enoch built the pyramid.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; It was im memorial. That's the reason it
[43:14] never destroyed during the time of the
[43:16] flood. There's nothing destroyed it
[43:18] because it's a memorial.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; All three Bibles of God
[43:22] &gt;&gt; are existent on the earth right now.
[43:25] God's first Bible, the heavens, you can
[43:27] still go out and see it.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; God's second Bible, the pyramid. If you
[43:30] go to Egypt, you can see it. Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; And God's Bible,
[43:35] &gt;&gt; written word is here. But we are living
[43:37] so privileged now. We are living in a
[43:40] time and season where the Bible has come
[43:42] out of the pages of the book.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; And you are living epistles read and
[43:46] known of all men.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; You become the walking living Bible.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[43:52] Let's just continue.
[43:56] There's nothing destroyed it because
[43:57] it's a memorial. Now, if you notice way
[43:59] down at the bottom, it's wide. Then it
[44:01] shapes up a little more in the minority.
[44:04] Then a little more. Then it come goes to
[44:06] the headstone. That's the Lutheran
[44:08] church age. Justification in the church,
[44:10] sanctification, then baptism of the Holy
[44:12] Ghost. But as it shapes towards the top,
[44:15] it continues from Lutheran age wes into
[44:17] Pentecostal. But after it leaves the
[44:19] Pentecostal age, it still shapes up
[44:22] until it has to get to such a place till
[44:25] all the stones are so owned till a razor
[44:28] blade. Right? He's trying to say again,
[44:31] you can't even put a razor blade where
[44:34] mortar should be. That's in paragraph
[44:37] 120 now. Amen.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; They can't they take this razor blade
[44:40] and run it along. It's so owned up
[44:42] perfect until you can't even put a razor
[44:44] blade where mortar should be. That's how
[44:46] perfect the stones are put together.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now with this headstone which
[44:53] the stones dove tail in like this kind
[44:56] of set in in ways of angles so that the
[44:59] headstone will come in a point and set
[45:01] right down into it. It won't need any
[45:04] mortar. It'll set perfect.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:12] Now that's what God is doing to his
[45:14] church is owning off his people of the
[45:16] people and making it such a perfect way
[45:19] that when the headstone Christ comes it
[45:21] fits the building together then the
[45:23] resurrection of the whole thing the
[45:25] church is gone up the headstone.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Now we are sitting together in heavenly
[45:30] places in Christ Jesus.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Where are we? This
[45:37] place is called the headstone
[45:39] up here to fit the headstone. This place
[45:42] is called heavenly places in Christ
[45:44] Jesus.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Remember that needle point is going into
[45:48] the pyramid.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; So we are caught up in here waiting now
[45:52] for the next one to come in. For the
[45:53] next one to come in, take their place.
[45:55] Take their place. Take their place.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:06] The church has come from a great
[46:08] reformation of the Lutheran age, then
[46:10] through the Wesley age into the
[46:12] Pentecostal age. Now it's shaping up
[46:15] like the headstone in the pyramid. Are
[46:17] we reading this?
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Are we finally understanding it where we
[46:21] are?
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; What is he saying again? Through the
[46:25] Wesley age into the Pentecostal and now
[46:27] it's shaping up like in the headstone in
[46:30] the pyramid.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; We're shaping in here.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] But you say, "I can't see you." It's no
[46:36] longer I that livethle
[46:38] &gt;&gt; but Christ that liveth in me.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "I can't see you in there." You
[46:42] gone to a needle point.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; You can't see us.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; It's shaping up like the headstone, the
[46:54] pyramid. Now, don't think I'm talking
[46:56] pyramid doctrine. I'm just showing
[46:58] example. Remember what we are saying.
[47:00] Forget just the picture of him.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Become more like Christ. Hallelujah.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Match Christ's ministry matches what he
[47:08] did and then we are shaping up. Just
[47:11] showing an example how it has to fit so
[47:13] perfect because it's not cemented. It
[47:16] just dropped in there.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Right. Next, the next one he uses
[47:22] different description. He says that
[47:24] church goes right out at the end. Right
[47:26] at the end of that, the church is going
[47:27] to have to be so perfectly
[47:33] like the ministry of Jesus Christ till
[47:35] when the stone comes, it sets right
[47:37] smack in the groove.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; See, you like to be in the groove.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; You always wanted to be grooving.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying you're in the
[47:45] groove.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; So don't think you're unpopular.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; You're the in thing and in for according
[47:51] to according to the world, you are out
[47:53] oldfashioned. You are outdated,
[47:56] &gt;&gt; but according to God, you are the latest
[47:58] version.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; You are the current flavor.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; You are the thing required for now, this
[48:03] time and season.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; If the world wants to hear from Jesus
[48:08] Christ, they've got to hear you.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Once more, the world will hear
[48:15] from God as at Pentecost.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Why? The word is in the bride.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Let's move on. Amen.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; So, you're right smack in the groove. So
[48:24] when they tell you you're old fashioned,
[48:25] must tell him, "No, I'm in the groove."
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; When they tell him you're outdated, you
[48:30] must say, "No, I'm in the groove."
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And you're quoting the prophet.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Now, if you're looking there at that at
[48:44] that pyramid again,
[48:47] put the last one we had up there on the
[48:49] PowerPoint.
[48:50] There are many people who claim to be
[48:54] So we know this was
[48:57] fifth church age 5 6 7 church age
[49:00] messengers people are claiming to be the
[49:02] eighth angel.
[49:05] How many of you know people claim to be
[49:06] eighth angel?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:10] If they tell you there's they believe in
[49:11] an eighth angel, you must have a
[49:13] conversation with them. Ask them who's
[49:15] your eighth angel? If they're pointing
[49:17] you to a messenger from the earth,
[49:20] &gt;&gt; oh yeah,
[49:21] &gt;&gt; then they are wrong. That's right.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; But if they are pointing you to a
[49:24] messenger from heaven.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Because the messenger of this age is the
[49:29] mighty angel.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; So then you must tell them, "Sorry,
[49:33] brother. You got your cow eating grass
[49:36] on top of the tree."
[49:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Because the messengers of the earth are
[49:42] finished.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Finished with William Branham.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; The messenger from heaven is the
[49:47] messenger of this age.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. Become a part of the word. Now he's
[49:58] encouraging you. Become a part of the
[50:01] word.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; A part of the word of today.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. In 2025,
[50:10] August 8th, become part of not August is
[50:13] is it or 10th. August 10th, become a
[50:16] part of the word.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful Lord.
[50:21] can't be part of the word for Moses day.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; That part is done made up. That was the
[50:28] feed.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; People want to walk in the footprints of
[50:31] the prophet.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; I want to hunt where he hunted. I want
[50:35] to sleep where he slept. I want to fish
[50:37] where he fished.
[50:43] What is he saying here? Can't be part of
[50:45] the word of Moses day. Who was our
[50:47] Moses?
[50:50] Hey, come on.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; We the third exodus.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; We had a prophet.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; The word prophet.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; He's saying can't be part of the word of
[50:58] Moses day. That part is done made up.
[51:01] Which means they done their ministry.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; They in the kingdom secure. That part is
[51:06] done made up. That was the feed. We at
[51:08] the
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Everybody say we at the
[51:13] &gt;&gt; This is
[51:19] &gt;&gt; I know some people's reflex time is a
[51:20] bit longer. That's why I'm waiting.
[51:22] Right. Let's read it again. We at the
[51:27] &gt;&gt; head now.
[51:29] So, how many of you think you're in the
[51:30] latest church age? He says, "We are at
[51:33] the
[51:34] &gt;&gt; head now.
[51:35] This is
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Christ,
[51:38] not arms time back in Luther. This is
[51:42] what time?
[51:43] &gt;&gt; This is head time.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Christ, the headstone comes to the body.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; This is in 64. Amen. Hallelujah. He
[51:55] called out the elect. Now watch. Put up
[51:57] that other picture there.
[52:00] He called out the elect to make the
[52:01] Lutheran. He called out the elect out of
[52:03] the Lutheran to make the Wesleyan. So
[52:06] what he is telling you, the people that
[52:08] made up John Wesley's age were called
[52:12] out of Luther's age.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; They didn't come from nowhere.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; They were once under Wesley's uh
[52:22] Luther's justification message.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; But they followed the leading of the
[52:26] spirit and they were called out of here.
[52:28] Come out of her, my people.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; They became Wesians. Amen.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Then the people that came out of
[52:34] Pentecost didn't come from nowhere.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; They were called out of John Wesley's
[52:38] age.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Called into this age.
[52:41] [Music]
[52:42] [Applause]
[52:43] &gt;&gt; They were people that make
[52:45] &gt;&gt; the flesh.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; The top stone didn't just pop out of
[52:49] anywhere. They were called out of the
[52:50] Pentecostal age.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Come out of all my people.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; So, let's continue reading that poll. He
[52:59] called out the elect to make the
[53:01] Lutheran. He called out the elect out of
[53:03] the Lutheran to make the Wesleyan. He
[53:05] called out the elect out of there to
[53:07] make the Pentecostal. Now he's calling
[53:09] the elect Pentecostals out to make the
[53:11] headstone to come into it.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; A Now again, watch. He's not just
[53:20] leaving you with a picture of a pyramid.
[53:22] He goes back to what it actually means.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; A very same kind of ministry dropping
[53:27] right in on it. calling his children
[53:30] from all denominations and all walks of
[53:32] life.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; The ministry must match. Then you know
[53:35] you're coming to needle point. Then you
[53:37] know you are in the headstone.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; So don't just be satisfied with doctrine
[53:42] and understanding teaching.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Is your life matching Christ?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; If your doctrine and your teaching is
[53:48] not making you like Christ, something is
[53:50] wrong with your doctrine and your
[53:51] teaching. That's right.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Which means if your teacher is not good
[53:56] enough for you, you need to get another
[53:58] teacher.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; You're failing maths, you need to get
[54:02] extra tuition.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; In the natural, we let's be honest now.
[54:06] Let's be real. In the natural, we are so
[54:08] concerned if we fail maths, fail
[54:11] physics, I want your private
[54:17] &gt;&gt; so particular about natural grades.
[54:19] We're failing miserably spiritually. And
[54:21] we thinking we're going to pass by with
[54:23] a double G.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; God's not going to take you, never mind,
[54:29] you failed, son. Come.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; No. You must overcome.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; You must perfect what you are perfected
[54:36] or called to be.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And you know what? It
[54:41] is in you to overcome.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; It is in you to come to perfection.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You just need to lay aside the
[54:47] things of this world, things that are
[54:49] holding you back and allow the spirit to
[54:51] take control.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; The very same kind of ministry dropping
[54:59] right in on it. Calling is shown from
[55:02] all denominations and all walks of life.
[55:05] Watch Brother Brandon doesn't stop
[55:06] there. Now watch, he's going to place
[55:07] somebody there. A ministry. Remember,
[55:10] the angel will only walk through people.
[55:12] Yes.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Now he says what has he done?
[55:16] So he called you out of latest year. He
[55:18] says he called you and then he says what
[55:20] has he done? He placed them with true
[55:22] teachers.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; True prophets who stay with the word.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; The Bible, my sheep hear his voice, said
[55:36] Jesus. If that was his voice, then it's
[55:38] his voice now. Anything contrary to that
[55:40] voice, it's not sheep food. they won't
[55:42] follow it.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Now, let's just see here
[55:51] what we we're going to we're trying to
[55:53] draw to a close now. The messenger to
[55:55] the bride age, the flange. Amen. The
[55:59] messenger to the bride age, which is
[56:01] also called the flange and the top stone
[56:03] to meet the headstone. It says that same
[56:06] Jesus Christ is here. We're just going
[56:08] to lay these quotes to thoroughly
[56:10] identify what the prophet says that he
[56:12] is here.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; That same Jesus Christ is here. He is
[56:17] the messenger.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Here is the message and he is the
[56:22] messenger toident here to identify his
[56:25] message.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Read it.
[56:34] He is the messenger here to identify his
[56:37] message.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; What is the message? You are coming into
[56:40] his likeness and image.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; He's here to identify you
[56:44] &gt;&gt; in my image. In my image. In my image.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Join. Join. Fit. Fit.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; I am not the messenger.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; He is the messenger.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; And this is the message.
[57:00] Now, if any of you disagree with it, how
[57:03] many of you disagree that William
[57:04] Brandom is not the messenger to the
[57:06] headstone?
[57:09] Well, let the prophet answer you. If
[57:10] you've got a spirit that disagrees with
[57:13] that,
[57:17] how can it be the messenger of the
[57:18] message? Only the token will identify
[57:21] it.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, so you mean you disagree with it?
[57:24] You don't have the Holy Ghost.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:33] Leave me in the latest year condition. I
[57:36] like every day the prophet to say come
[57:38] out of my people because me I love
[57:40] Netflix. I love showmanax. Me I love my
[57:43] movies. I love my worldly things. Leave
[57:45] me here because I still want the prophet
[57:47] every day to call me.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; And every now and again I feel uh I feel
[57:52] under conviction and I come out.
[57:56] Leave me in the lead spirit.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; leave me there. I like the prophet
[58:01] shouting
[58:03] &gt;&gt; talking to me about my dressing, talking
[58:05] to me about my shorts and my short
[58:08] dresses.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; People like that message.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; He's saying that's not the message
[58:15] &gt;&gt; for the people up here.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. Let's go to 159
[58:23] again because we are killing spirits
[58:25] now.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; That same Jesus Christ is here.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; He is the messenger.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Here is the message. He is the messenger
[58:32] to identify his message.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; It's not William Brandham's message.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; It's his message.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not the messenger. He is the
[58:41] messenger.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; And this is the message.
[58:45] And if you've got a spirit that
[58:47] disagrees with that,
[58:49] &gt;&gt; how can it be the messenger of the
[58:51] message?
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Only the token will identify it.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Now that word flange,
[59:00] let's put up that slide there where we
[59:01] get the description of the word flange.
[59:04] This is according to Webster. Now, a
[59:06] rip. Wow.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; I wonder who's the missing rib to meet
[59:11] the headstone.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:15] Lord.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; You mean only at the end time he comes
[59:20] looking for his queen?
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; And the root that was taken from his
[59:24] side at Calvary is put back.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Why is he calling us a flange?
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet called us a flange.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; He says it's a flange at the top. Yeah.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; But now when we go and look at the
[59:39] meaning of land, it says a rip
[59:42] &gt;&gt; or form of strength for guiding or for
[59:45] an attachment to another object.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Father,
[59:56] &gt;&gt; now if we go back to the quote, he says,
[59:59] you get it. Those people who died in
[1:00:02] here are depending, waiting on us. So
[1:00:04] this church has got to come to
[1:00:06] perfection in order to bring the
[1:00:08] resurrection.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there souls under the altar
[1:00:10] waiting for the church to come to his
[1:00:12] perfection.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we read this. I'm just quoting
[1:00:16] it again to show you. It's a whole lot
[1:00:18] sharper than that, right? It's come to a
[1:00:20] needle point. Praise the Lord. So he's
[1:00:23] calling a pocket like I'm just going to
[1:00:26] that. So the next one is 175 F not I
[1:00:29] sent thee. He says now what is he doing
[1:00:31] that's got to be owned out so perfect
[1:00:33] that church brought into such a place
[1:00:35] that the stone that's coming to fit on
[1:00:37] top of it you say why are you repeating
[1:00:40] why you not believing
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; now let's get to the word that we are
[1:00:45] actually called we are called flange
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; we are called needle point
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; we are called honed out people we are
[1:00:54] called holy ghost bunch
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; is that all the words we've been
[1:00:57] speaking
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; let's find another word the prophet uses
[1:00:59] to describe us and from now on we will
[1:01:01] know what our true name is
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; in the pyramid
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; listen he says you believe that this is
[1:01:07] the hour that Jesus is to come
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; that the church has to come from
[1:01:11] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:01:14] the Holy Ghost just like the pyramid
[1:01:16] like the coming and now the top stone is
[1:01:19] going to have to be so perfect
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; what stone
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen stone
[1:01:29] Yeah.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; You see, don't call yourself dogs.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; People like to say, "Hey, me, I'm a top
[1:01:34] dog."
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; No, me. I'm a top stone.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a top stone.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Read carefully like read slowly. And now
[1:01:42] the top stone is going to have to be so
[1:01:45] perfect.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; All the time he's saying we the church
[1:01:48] will have to be perfect. Church will
[1:01:49] have to be perfect. Now he's changing
[1:01:52] our name. The top stone will have to be
[1:01:54] so perfect.
[1:01:56] When the headstone comes, it has to
[1:01:58] blend right with it.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Then he goes to describe it again. The
[1:02:02] ministry has to start out like this and
[1:02:04] just come into the minority all the time
[1:02:07] getting smaller groups. Smaller groups.
[1:02:09] You mean smaller groups? Why your church
[1:02:11] is so small?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know. He's saying smaller groups
[1:02:14] here.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Can't we get a bigger group? Maybe we
[1:02:17] can, but he's saying smaller groups.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Until finally the stone meets with the
[1:02:24] building. He is the headstone.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Takes the whole building within which is
[1:02:29] the church. All of them will raise up
[1:02:31] plum back from the first watch onto the
[1:02:33] seventh and all go to the rapture. Each
[1:02:35] one had their day loed to them. They had
[1:02:37] the reformers founders so forth all
[1:02:39] down. And in this last days, it come
[1:02:42] into the eagle again
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; which is back into the prophetic age to
[1:02:46] bring this together.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Right. In in the statue of a perfect
[1:02:51] man, he says we are approaching the
[1:02:52] seals. We just finished the seven church
[1:02:54] ages and this message on teaching that
[1:02:57] ties a man that's going to be redeemed
[1:02:59] by the blood of the Lord Jesus that's
[1:03:01] going to be in the church age that
[1:03:02] eternal church age at the end of the
[1:03:05] seals.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; So this is also called the blending in.
[1:03:08] It's an eternal church age that time
[1:03:10] will blend with eternity
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; up here.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; So did brother Brandham as a seven
[1:03:18] church age messenger like John the
[1:03:20] Baptist hear what he's saying
[1:03:23] declaring that he is here in the message
[1:03:26] the patriarch Abraham 1964 he says my
[1:03:30] ministry is different is a different
[1:03:32] ministry from a pastor or teacher but
[1:03:35] this is my ministry see to declare him
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; that he is here.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Everyone say he
[1:03:44] is here.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know what we're talking
[1:03:47] about when we are saying that he is
[1:03:50] here.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; What is brother Brandham's ministry to
[1:03:54] declare?
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; So which means if brother Brandham is
[1:04:01] dead
[1:04:03] then he must have already declared that
[1:04:05] he is here.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:09] Then he says, "Look what we've seen in
[1:04:10] this day. The quickening power has come
[1:04:13] to us."
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; What is quickening power? Another name
[1:04:17] dynamics.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; The quickening power has come to us to
[1:04:23] open the seven seals.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; What was that? The intelligence of a
[1:04:27] man. No, the quickening power of God.
[1:04:29] The quickening power of God for who told
[1:04:31] us what would take place. Quickening
[1:04:33] power of God made the world testify to
[1:04:35] it. It's the truth. The angel of the
[1:04:37] Lord I told you was around in a pillar
[1:04:40] of fire quickening power. Let the world
[1:04:42] testify that it's the truth.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And in that they didn't know what it
[1:04:45] was. We knew just look this way. It's
[1:04:48] our Lord up there.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm tying
[1:04:52] something you very sharp.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; He just said my ministry to declare is
[1:04:56] here.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; And in this message, he's saying it's
[1:04:58] our Lord up there.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. People don't like to read. Amen.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; They still want to go down here later.
[1:05:10] Talk about this. Talk about that.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Did he say his ministry to declare he's
[1:05:16] here?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; What is he saying here?
[1:05:21] And nobody wants to read this.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; It's our Lord up there.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; So which means he declared he is here.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:34] This is in now 1965. He's preparing to
[1:05:36] leave the earth. It's in the message. It
[1:05:38] is the rising of the sun.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] I know a lot of you probably theology is
[1:05:46] getting shaken now because you believe
[1:05:47] in brother Brandham opened the seven
[1:05:48] seals and did all of this. Let's keep
[1:05:50] reading.
[1:05:53] It's our Lord up there 308.
[1:05:57] He is the one
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; who opened those seals. Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; You see why? Because you are like that
[1:06:05] boy standing by Elisha.
[1:06:08] All you can see
[1:06:10] is physical things.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; He could see physical things. Syrian
[1:06:15] army.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; So Elisha said, "Lord, open the boy's
[1:06:19] eyes."
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Now if you were looking at William
[1:06:21] Brandham and you can only see William
[1:06:23] Brham, we are praying that the Lord open
[1:06:25] your eyes to see behind the veil.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And even this morning, if you can
[1:06:30] see beyond the veil, you'll see who's
[1:06:31] standing here speaking to you.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Because physical uh expectations will
[1:06:39] only see physical things, physical
[1:06:41] manifestations.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; He is the one who opened those seals.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; He is those seals. For the whole word of
[1:06:49] God is Christ and Christ is the seals
[1:06:51] that was opened. What is the opening of
[1:06:53] the seals then? Revealing Christ.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the very seven angels which
[1:06:59] represented the seven church ages all
[1:07:01] complete. We couldn't even see it. They
[1:07:04] did. They took the picture
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; and they look at it like this. They took
[1:07:08] the picture.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; So when they see it, all they see is
[1:07:14] this
[1:07:16] until
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; he got decoded information
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; from the world that it was sent.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; He got communication. Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; He said he let me know I was looking at
[1:07:29] the picture the wrong way.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; He beat FBI
[1:07:35] intelligence.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; He beat
[1:07:38] C I intelligence.
[1:07:40] He beat M16 intelligence.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; It beat South African intelligence.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Here was not artificial intelligence
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; but supreme intelligence. Hallelujah.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know what, man? Turn down
[1:07:57] the picture
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; to the right."
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Because science will tell you, "We don't
[1:08:05] want to temple with the picture. We want
[1:08:07] to see it the way it was taken."
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; This is the original.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Even message people preach this. Keep it
[1:08:15] the original way. What? according to the
[1:08:17] world
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; or you going to take what the law told
[1:08:21] the prophet
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; turn it to the right.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; That's our Lord up there.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Right. They took the picture, not us.
[1:08:36] And there he is. And there is
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; standing right beside his little bride.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? There he is standing
[1:08:51] there. Supreme church
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; showing that he is alpha and omega,
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; beginning and the end. And what
[1:09:00] identification? What did that to you?
[1:09:02] Quickening power did that to us.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Do you know what? It's not only back
[1:09:07] there. He's still doing it now.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Even now, quickening power is
[1:09:10] illuminating our minds.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Even now, quickening power is making it
[1:09:14] more clear to us. Quickening power is
[1:09:16] making it more real to us.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Quickening power, let us see his coming.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Quickening power snatched us from death
[1:09:26] to life.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; We are here to welcome back Jesus.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Our ministry is to welcome back the
[1:09:33] headstone. He says the hearts of the
[1:09:35] last day children will be turned back to
[1:09:37] the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; John got the fathers ready for Jesus to
[1:09:42] welcome the children into the fold. Now
[1:09:44] this prophet upon whom the spirit of
[1:09:46] Elijah falls would prepare the children
[1:09:48] to welcome back Jesus.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; As William Brandon prepared you to
[1:09:53] welcome back Jesus.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then how about we welcome him
[1:09:56] back. Say, "Lord, shake me, mold me,
[1:10:00] hold me up, oh God, so that I can
[1:10:02] welcome back Jesus."
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Let's get another quote in there
[1:10:05] quickly. But thank God, in the last
[1:10:06] days, there will be a group rise up. The
[1:10:08] true bride of the last day, she will
[1:10:10] listen to the spirit in the day of gross
[1:10:13] darkness.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; The light shalom will return
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; by the pure word. And we will return to
[1:10:19] the power of Pentecost to welcome back
[1:10:22] the Lord Jesus Christ. So I'm expecting
[1:10:24] the power that was there in Pentecost to
[1:10:27] be the power back in the church.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; God will put a power back in the church.
[1:10:31] They'll stop sickness. They'll stop
[1:10:33] disease. They'll stop cancer. Whatever
[1:10:35] they say will happen on the earth.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; why will it be them? No. It will be him
[1:10:43] in them.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. last quote. Now in the
[1:10:51] seventh seal, he says, "And did you
[1:10:53] notice that one angel,
[1:10:56] the one that everyone is confused about,
[1:11:00] the one that they thinking it's William
[1:11:02] Brandham, they're saying William Brandom
[1:11:03] saw himself.
[1:11:06] That one angel I said in there was a
[1:11:08] strange angel.
[1:11:10] He looked more to me than any of the
[1:11:13] rest of them. You remember that
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; they were in the constellation. Three on
[1:11:18] a side, one on the top. Now everyone,
[1:11:21] everyone good at math here? Three on a
[1:11:23] side. That's 3 + 3
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; and one on the top. How many is that?
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Seven. Okay.
[1:11:29] And the one right next to me, which
[1:11:32] means brother Brandham is also caught up
[1:11:33] in there.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Was he caught up?
[1:11:39] And the one so listen to why I'm
[1:11:42] bringing that point. He's saying there
[1:11:44] seven.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; So the one on the top they are saying
[1:11:47] that was William Brandham.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; It's theophony
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; but it's Christ.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Because what he saying and the one right
[1:11:57] next to me
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; counting from the left to the right
[1:12:00] would have been the seventh. So he is
[1:12:02] saying I am not that seventh angel.
[1:12:05] People are confusing the seventh angel
[1:12:07] of revelation 10
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; and counting the seven angels in the
[1:12:10] pyramid.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; They need to be taught properly.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; These seven angels that came are
[1:12:18] heavenly angels.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says they had wings,
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; swept back wings, powerful wings, great
[1:12:24] wings.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Flying wings.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; And the one right next to me here, so it
[1:12:31] wasn't him, it was next to him.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:34] Counting from the left to the right
[1:12:35] would have been the seventh angel. He
[1:12:37] was brighter.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Meant more to me than the rest of them.
[1:12:41] You remember
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; he had his chest out like that.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Was flying eastward.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; He's flying eastward. You remember like
[1:12:53] that? It picked me up,
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; lifted me up. You remember that?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Here it is. The one with the seventh
[1:13:00] seal.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Didn't we just read there?
[1:13:03] He didn't open the seventh seal.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Here it is. The one with the seventh
[1:13:08] seal. Christ.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; The thing I've wanted all my life. Amen.
[1:13:12] Them other seals meant a lot to me. Of
[1:13:14] course, but oh, you don't know what this
[1:13:16] has meant for one time in life.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; So to summarize, we are not in the
[1:13:23] ladies church age.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride has been gathered
[1:13:26] here now
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; like a flange, a rip
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; to fit the headstone.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; There may be one or two, maybe even this
[1:13:34] morning, one or two are going to come up
[1:13:35] to the headstone.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; We don't know when the rapture will take
[1:13:39] place.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; But I tell you, church, we don't have
[1:13:41] long.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; We don't have long.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; So, if you need to make your life right,
[1:13:45] make it right now.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; If you need to repent, repent now. If
[1:13:48] you need to get right with God, get
[1:13:50] right with God now.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; You heard what the prophet of God says
[1:13:53] there. He left a true five-fold. He left
[1:13:55] a true pastor. He left a true teacher.
[1:13:58] He left a true prophet.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; So that the angel of God can walk
[1:14:01] through.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. How about we give the Lord a good
[1:14:04] hand of praise?
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, we bless his name.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is the picture becoming more
[1:14:13] clear?
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; We understand our time and season
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; now. Then he says, remember he says the
[1:14:19] musicians can come. If we understand our
[1:14:21] time and season, he says, then we can
[1:14:23] have the right kind of faith.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; So our ministry must match Jesus Christ.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; We must be so in his image and likeness.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Forgive me. Sometimes
[1:14:38] I'm just a bit sharp in my words, the
[1:14:40] way I say things, but it's to bring a
[1:14:42] point.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Because when you're handling swords,
[1:14:48] swords are not blunt.
[1:14:50] Amen.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; And you know a word is a sword.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Words are meant to cut.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Because horning takes a lot of cutting.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; To get that needle point takes a lot of
[1:15:03] cutting.
[1:15:05] Needs a brickmason.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just worship him and give him
[1:15:13] praise. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:15:18] Let's sing. Let your word be born in the
[1:15:20] manger of my heart.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Can we sing it?
[1:15:24] Amen.
