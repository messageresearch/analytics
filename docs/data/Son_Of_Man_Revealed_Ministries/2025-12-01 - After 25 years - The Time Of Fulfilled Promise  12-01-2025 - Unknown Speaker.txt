TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen I'm going to be speaking on after 25 years the time of fulfilled promise amen after 25 years the time of fulfilled promise I'm speaking on high expectations and high Ambitions amen amen hallelujah so we go to Genesis Chapter 18 praise the Lord Genesis Chapter 18 we're going to read from verse 9 we'll find from verse 1 to 8 it's it's the Lord coming with the two angels and Abraham getting to work but I want to pay attention on verse from verse 9 because no matter what Abraham is doing when the time of Promise is fulfilled God is looking for the one through Whom The Promise will be fulfill yes so Abraham is preparing the FedEd C and he's preparing bread and he's washing feet and doing all of these things but verse 9 says and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife amen I'm looking for the body through which the promise is going to come through amen now since the promise was given till this time 25 years had left lapsed okay everyone paying attention there and he said behold in the tent under the third pool there's a people in the tent come on you got to know the message not to know where I'm at amen amen there's a little room in the tent and that's where you're going to find the bride of Christ and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son so expect the promise to be fulfilled in our lives is meaning we are going to come into the image of Christ and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him so she hears this now she hears the message now Sarah and Abraham were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman amen praise the Lord therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure with my Lord being old also and the Lord said to Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of aurity be a child which am whole is anything too hard for the Lord I'm asking you that this morning is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou this laugh thou this laughed right amen the Lord are blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated I don't want to keep you standing for too long now notice like we are saying I want to make the statement as well that and ask you or a question how does God measure faithfulness amen how does God measure faithfulness amen God measures faithfulness by what we've done with the promise of his word what we have done with the promise of his word now notice I'm saying what you have done with it not just that you know the word but God measures faithfulness by what you have done with the promise of his word now I want to go to a cour and uh after 25 years I want to read something here we've been through this I just want to reiterate this brother Bram is saying things happen in cycles of 2,000 years first 2,000 years Noah built an ark flood second 2,000 years Christ come this is the end of the Gentiles another 2,000 years yes sir now at the End of the Age he's got to declare himself the same as he did then or he did wrong so we were expecting something to happen after 2,000 years since Jesus died rose again then brother Bram goes in the message Shalom preach 1964 he says Abraham come to his Crossroad and after he had trusted God and had seen all the miracles of god 25 years he waited for a boy a prom son and then God told him to go sacrifice the very thing he had waited for so I'm saying after 25 years the angel comes and he appears to Abraham and Sarah that's what we reading in Genesis 18 God had L them to the point to this point in their life and position them for this visitation I'm saying after people were expecting things in the year 2000 but now it's after 25 years amen amen yes amen and after 25 years when the Lord comes to Sarah he still finds her in unbelief right think of the church now think of the Bride of Jesus Christ is there any hidden unbelief the angel is going to expose that how is it going to be exposed when he's declaring the promise over your life you you yourself your response to the word is going to expose that unbelief because all the Lord did was say Sarah is going to have a son and she laughs we are saying the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to bring forth the Life of Christ what's our attitude are we laughing we are saying we are coming into the image and likeness of Jesus Christ what's our response are we laughing now notice God doesn't deal with the unbelief through judgment God's going to bring it to pass with whether you believe it or not Hallelujah you are the chosen one you are the elected one God has to bring it through your body amen amen hallelujah so which means something must be done to sah and a condition in order to bring the Fulfillment to pass now notice after 25 years God is driving out all the unbelief all the laughing at the Angel's message all the laughing at the cloud all the laugh in at the pillar of fire is going to come to an end amen amen amen wonderful what was s supposed to do as soon as the the Lord told her you're going to have a son she's supposed to be like Mary and say be it unto me according to Thy word amen but she laughed about it and maybe people laugh about things for so long you're saying the Lord is coming back but I'm saying after 25 years for so long you've been saying a super Church a super rais Invincible Army but I'm saying after 25 years hallah thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord now if you go past the next verse where we stopped after 25 years comes the Judgment of Sodom and gomorra amen oh yes we started out this year by saying the opening of Dimensional Doors we showed you Matthew 25 how a door was open to the bride under the shout it's a dimensional door that's why the outside world don't know nothing about it they look at us but we are shut in and caught up in a dimension called the shout hallelujah it's a process of the rapture we are in the amen we are in the process of the Rapture but we maybe we've never thought about it that way but we are caught up into a dimension amen a door was open the the Bible says read Matthew 25 again a door was open the bride was pulled in and he shut the door then the the foolish come knocking on the door but they can't access the hidden place yes Hallelujah now after 25 years judgment is coming hallelujah what was prophesied over Los Angeles the prophet you know he preaching that message I think it's on the wings of a snow white d one of those messages and he goes out into prophecy and he says capernium capernium you will call yourselves a City of Angels and he declared judgment over that city right amen hallelujah so after 25 years we are seeing amen that that hell is being ported upon the Earth right you are seeing the leader of the Free World amen the new president elect coming in and you going to see doors open listen to what he declared we posted on the group he says all hell is going to break loose over the Middle East though they don't release the hostages I say if a natural man can be so passionate about hostages amen kept in the Physical Realm how about children of God Sons and Daughters of God like Abraham amen become militant about Sons and Daughters of God that are H captive and say all hell is going to break loose over Satan's kingdom if you don't release the captive if you don't let the sick go yes amen thank you Lord Glory hallelujah praise the Lord you know I'm reminded of the story I'll tell you very quickly there was one couple their child was held in in amen with a with a with a life-threatening disease in fact the child was at the point of death but this people this couple was in faith and they would go there and they would sit at the hospital amen outside the hospital and all the parents that would come there they would testify of to Jesus healing power amen and tell them amen God is able to raise up your child if you just believe amen that that by his stripes we were healed amen amen amen yet their child was at the point of death and they started to talk amen and say Satan if you don't release our child and heal that child we are going to St stay here and testify to everyone about God's healing power amen that's how determined they were for the healing of their child what do we do amen praise the Lord now when God calls a man he doesn't call him because he's better than somebody else the prophet is saying now amen but God called him he says now this is for Christian he says the first thing when God calls you he wants you to separate yourself amen amen amen so the first thing we got to do is separate ourselves separate yourself from kindreds people Associates your habits separate from everything and come and stand alone for God he says the first man was called by election talking about Abraham the last man being called to do the same thing separate yourself from your Associates things of the world come out from among them be separate he said then I'll bless you if you want a blessing separate from the things of the world you see people want the blessings of God without the separation so we are learning when he calls a man he asked him to separate himself when that man separates himself the prophet says God calls a man and anoints him for a certain Duty he expects that man to carry that out to the letter so God has an expectation on us to carry out what he has called us to do to the letter amen God doesn't want to give a man a commission and him him more about that amen he doesn't want you to pray like a donkey are you hearing what the prophet is saying God doesn't give a man a commission and him him all around about it he wants him to go straight forward and do exactly what he's commissioned to do don't look to the right or left just move forward when God calls a man to do something he might as well come to do it or he'll be miserable all the days of his life yes sir yeah now when God called William brandham William brandham was not laying idle William gram was preaching he was involved in the things of God Amen but the angel come to the prophet in a cave God called him and commissioned him to do something and he did not not sit idle after the commission he started out on a healing campaign and God showed him his ministry was going to grow in stages the prophet calls it pools but his ministry was going to grow to higher Heights what was this tell me the work of the Holy Ghost so tell me he was growing in higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord now the the angel told the prophet if you'll be sincere so sincerity is very important amen if you're being sincere in what we are doing if you being sincere and get the people to believe so God is revealing to him that there'll be stages of his ministry and God was going to release greater portions to him as time went on from the first to the second to the third pool so if we look at the life of Bram and the life of Abraham God was releasing the blessing to Abraham in stages sir God was releasing it to him little by little amen hallelujah God took the span of 25 years to release until the full fruition of that promise amen so I'm saying don't grow weary God is releasing to the church what's required we read last week that each year God unlocks the promises for that year so God has promises locked up for this year for us amen praise the Lord amen now in Matthew 25 we find that the bride at one stage was moving with oil light she was moving with oil in a lamp can I call it lamp light Hallelujah I'm asking you are we still moving around with lamp light where have we've been pulled in to the presence of the sunlight Hallelujah amen thank you Lord amen he's a brightstor moving around with oil in a lamp trimmed and burning outside the shout amen maybe you must put up the scripture amen Matthew 25 then when the bridegroom came he pulled it in to the marriage am Hallelujah than now why is the prophet preaching invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ why is he preaching the marriage of the Lamb amen is she still is the bride still wandering out in Gross Darkness with the light of the lamp and the Holy Ghost come on H why have we been pulled into the marriage amen amen yes you see why last year was important to share in his glory he opens up the dimensional door to make us share in his glory hallelujah amen and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in amen went into what the door had to be open because the yeah says went in with him the marriage and the door was shut so the door was open to the bride the sharp message a dimensional door I'm saying it again amen because repetition until it's ingrained in our spirit I tell you again ask somebody else to believe this message tell you they can't that's right something Supernatural is Happ hallelujah amen a dimensional door was open to us praise the Lord so it's not the time when the wise virgin is walking around with lamp light hey somebody say Amen when you get pulled into the marriage of the Lamb you're walking in the presence of the sunlight the full access amen now under the shout she the bride is built up into a Great Pyramid City yes you know that statue of a perfect man I'm going to say every time the sh message went forward a pyramid city was built am praise the Lord amen that was true Amen in the days of Enoch Enoch heard the shout message he had to have heard the shout yes amen because the message was going forth come on now people of God the message was going forth amen there was two messages going forth one for Enoch and one for Noah the prophet is saying that Noah was typing the tribulation Saints but there was a general message that was going forth but the only record you will read in the written word is the details for Noah and his church but for Enoch it's under the silence thank you Lord in Noah is building the ark and it's deep detail there the dimensions the width the type of width amen the it detail sanctification justification and detail every aspect of it you can find the plans there yes in fact people have have actually taken those plans and they've reproduce the ark because it's in such detail so they can reproduce churches because that blueprint was laid open there but under that seven seal amen when he open that seven seal it's in silence Hallelujah amen even up to today all they can see is the Great Pyramid in Giza but there's no blueprint in the Bible recording out God told Enoch to build that pyramid that pyramid was built in silence amen so you are seeing even now amen that was Enoch the 7eventh from Adam Enoch amen hallelujah had to have the Shar message the Thunders were revealed to him and in the Silence of that seven seal he built the Great Pyramid which is called god's second Bible now notice the plans and details given to Noah to build the ark and Noah typed those going in the tribulation but Enoch held the mystery of the Rapture and when a door was opened to him a dimensional door the mystery of God was revealed to Enoch and he built that Pyramid in Egypt Enoch the seventh from Adam was a type of the bride at the end of the seven Church age a shout goes out to call her amen and under that mystery of that seven seal she's being built up into a pyramid City a statue of a perfect man I'm telling you that all the building into a perfect city is here being D on the earth that's why when you see that City coming down in Revelation 20 amen 21 to 22 that city was already built because what goes up must come back down you can't go back up amen unless you are completely built isn't that the Rapture message until amen the church is completely hon to meet The Headstone so she goes up as a pyramid therefore she comes back down as a pyramid City somebody give God an of Praise so it means God's not going to do a certain part of redemption in heaven everything needs to be done on the earth amen the reason the bride is taken to the married supper is because he wants to come now and bring judgment upon the earth and the prophet says any true man who loves his wife will not leave his wife in Tribulation so he takes her away to the married supper for three and a half years he brings tribulation upon the Earth yeah Hallelujah show short message amen don't you love the beautiful type of Enoch Hallelujah not a word recorded all it says that Enoch walked with God amen hallelujah oh yes but now we are finding who built the Pyramid even now if you go Google it you'll see fresh videos yes they're wondering how was the pyramid built it was done in silence amen you are seeing big fans churches a big Ark being built to take those Saints into tribulation but there's a bride called opened a dimensional door to her amen hallelujah under the shout am yes praise the Lord so I'm saying that the Rapture is going to open up in dimensional stages to the bride the shout has been opened to her next will come the voice of the Resurrection now if you don't believe that the prophet of God says this that the bride will be taken from the earth and they won't know a thing about it they'll go on preaching they'll go on having church so I am saying think of it and a more in God's way of thinking it means he's opening up the Rapture in stages he's opening it up to her in Dimensions he's opened the dimension of the shout all that are called amen every predestinated seed will come in under the shout amen waiting now amen for the voice of the Resurrection Amen to call those sleeping Saints amen but can you see how through the carnal eye it will seem like you're are just another church to the kind eye it will seem like you are just another church but we have been caught up dimensionally amen thank you thank you amen praise the Lord so God opened up the door to the bride and pulled her into the shout Dimension the shout Dimension is only for the bride the shout is the rapture the sh is a call for the living Saints under the Shar Dimension the bride is in the process of perfection by the word amen the word is revealing to her a true identity a purpose and the Seven Thunders which are the Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals are preparing her for great translation Faith amen yeah the prophet of God now I'm trying to show you don't be without purpose the prophet is saying amen that he's talking about a boy and notice this boy I just picked this up now or maybe I never knew that this was here I was focusing more on this boy that didn't have any ambition but watch what he says here I was thinking of the story some time ago a colored boy he was about 25 years old you that part I never read before are was speaking about up to 25 years the boy was 25 years he was kind of a floater he was a gentleman not a fugitive or Renegade he was a gentleman just a guy that likes to float around no place to go nothing to do do that's a horrible way to take life right I gave a man his dinner some time ago was a bum what did you start this when did you start this about 20 years ago where are you going he said nowhere I said then where did you come from he said oh nowhere I said how long do you expect to keep this up he said oh I don't know now what's a prophet no Ambitions why the Christian ought to be the most ambitious person in the world bring this glorious Gospel of eternal life to a dying and perishing world we should be up and at it amen tell your neighbor be up and at it Hallelujah he says no Ambitions the Christian ought to be the most ambitious person he says sometime ago I read the story of the noble one of the greatest presidents I think the nation ever had was Lincoln not because he come from Kentucky but because he was a great man he was deprived of an education but yet was something in his heart some purpose now here's the quote that we always read so maybe you must memorize this doors indoors paragraph 87 I like a man of vision I like people that's got something they're fighting for amen just not lay around whatever will come will be all right oh be up and at it and Lincoln never let his education stand in the way so I don't care amen about your education God don't care about your education God didn't care about Moses education God didn't care about the prophet's education he had something to do I think every Christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it find your purpose and go do it every member of this chapter just not well we'll have a breakfast once a month that's it that isn't it amen or once every Saturday have a purpose in life how many if you want to encourage your brother sitting next to you and tell them have a purpose in life praise theone having purpose in life something you're going to do Hallelujah God has placed you here do something about it now I want you to know that God likes a highly ambitious church but I also want to remind you God says God don't deal with the church as a group God deals with the church as an individual everybody know that the prophet of God says that it deals with you as an individual so what does that mean every IND individual needs to be ambitious come on now cuz God don't deal with the church as a group it deals with individuals so if God likes an highly ambitious church every individual must be ambitious well praise the Lord anyhow amen God placed you here do something about it oh you go to son of man reveal Ministries what do you do that H nothing do something about it every member of every Church there's a Revival in town There's a Revival there for a purpose let's get something out of it let's do something about it yes sir in the message look the prophet is saying find your purpose that God brought you here in life find your purpose that God brought you here in life praise the Lord when God sends a man to do anything he completely equips him with everything he has need of so there's no need to be afraid the prophet is saying when God calls a man to do anything he completely equips him to do amen with everything he has need of so don't worry how you're going to do things for the kingdom now remember the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all of these things shall be added unto you so don't say Lord I'm so inadequate Lord I need to make my life perfect first before you can ever use me no God is looking for a surrendered vessel when God call sends a man to do anything he completely equips him praise the Lord amen I I've already taught you how to receive the word that when things are like this are being preached amen you can even whisper speak aloud and say Lord he put me amen amen receive the promise as it's being preached amen if God calls a man to be a preacher he puts something in him to preach with if he calls him to be a teacher he put something in him to teach with if he called him to be a prophet he put something in him to see Visions to be a prophet God always completely equips the man praise the Lord now think of all the promises regarding the bride yes completely is going to equip Us Praise the Lord amen when God speaks to a man he has Faith he has ambition he has a purpose when God speaks to a man he gives him a purpose when God speaks to a man he gives him ambition when God speaks to a man he gives him free to do it to accomplish to achieve what his purpose in life is what God called him to do he called us to be in the Church of God amen amen now there's a difference between our own personal ambition and God's ambition for our lives I want you to go back through your list when we saying write the vision and every one of your own natural personal things that you were Desiring to do I want you to scratch it off praise the Lord amen amen when God asked Solomon what do you want Solomon said Lord I want a palace Solomon said I want a promotion Solomon said I want this nice car what did Solomon ask for wisdom now I want you to know the source of all wisdom is here in the form of the Holy Ghost amen so top of our list in write the vision should be Lord fill me with your Holy Ghost because that is wisdom coming to the person now when wisdom comes in that's the kingdom of God Amen the Holy Ghost is the kingdom of God coming into the believer and watch there now every other thing will be added unto you thank God has predestinated you into your position wherever you are but don't do it without the Holy Ghost because yeah the prophet is saying a man has to surrender every ambition he's got everything he is everything is life soul body will Ambitions and everything else and be a complete prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God Amen God before he can get the man in his hand he has to strip him of his ambition somebody say Strip Me Lord of my ambition he had to strip him of all his training praise the Lord amen and we read that amen yeah now we we are looking at some examples and we're going through what the prophet is saying now I'm trying to show you this is not my teaching this is the prophet showing you that this church needs to be an highly ambitious church we are talking about after 25 years the time of f full promise Hallelujah the prophet is saying all Abraham's life he was a pilgrim stranger to the world for his one ambition was to find what was his one ambition to find that City whose build and maker was God he struck something he caught God and a Fai in that God that he fora the New Jerusalem and he was and he was put his pack on his back and became a wander not just floating around without any purpose he had faith that there was a city whose Builder and maker was God an eternal City he had a purpose in life to find that place Moses had an ambition Never Was the Same after that he had an ambition he had something to work forward to and he had Faith to do it all the days of his life he served God to deliver those people he wasn't concerned amen long as he was getting along all right what he cared about the those people laying down their suffering and God said I've heard the cries of my people I remember my promise which I had spoken with Abraham we know that our lord Jesus was ambitious and packed with purpose of the will of the father amen yeah the prophet is saying God selected the man for the age selected the message even the nature of the man and what would go over in that age what could put over amen the nature of a certain man he could blind the eyes of others the words of that man the way he acted would blind others and open others eyes he dressed the man in a certain type of dress the nature the ambition and everything just the way he had to be can you see how God Amen he packs us with purpose he packs us with ambition he packs us with a drive to serve him let's go on reading While others would look at him and say well I can't I can't see it they were blinded Jesus came the same way dressed Immortal God dressed in human flesh and because he was born in a manger in a stable full of manure not placed to lay his head born thinking with an illegit illegitimate name t to it and now he come up he Carpenter son he had no schooling but I want you to know that the age of 12 Jesus was already packed with ambition yes Jesus was already packed with purpose that he told Mary don't you know I must be a about my father's business his life's ambition was to do the will of the father amen so God does not call lazy people hallelujah amen amen God does not call lazy people with no ambition Hallelujah when God called David he was tending sheep he was having Supernatural experiences while he was protecting that sheep when God Called Moses he was tending jetro's flock when God called Isaiah he was serving in the temple when God called Samuel he was serving under Eli when God called Elisha he was walking in the field serving Elijah when God called Peter Peter was fishing he was not doing nothing Jesus told him I'll make you fishes of men God does not call or use lazy people amen because he's looking for co-workers who will work in the kingdom of God when God called William Brom he was not laying idle he was already preaching in the Baptist Church he was already in the ministry amen he didn't have no he wasn't sitting around with no purpose in life he was at work so God always used those that I work praise the Lord Jesus did not sit around and be idle when time and season comes around he's got a work to do and that work was finished finished at the cross when he rose again he instructed the church to pick up the mantle and to carry out the further Plan of Redemption God does not want us to be lazy he puts the church to work and he says go into all the world and preach the gospel so we become co-workers amen with the holy spirit amen now I'm going to make you accountable amen tell your neighbor get ready for some accountability here what the prophet says don't you see the church is dead there's no more ambition in the church for lost souls and everybody said I'm guilty praise the Lord now don't let's not get complacent now I'm called in the message I believe the message I'm happy and we never sh Our Testimony with anyone we never go to spread the gospel praise the Lord amen don't go quiet on me now amen I'm just reading back what the prophet is saying now that there's no more ambition in the church for lost souls brother you know when you said High Ambitions and high expectations I thought you're talking about my my material stuff I got so excited in the beginning I'll come out to church and close that all in the roof there I jump so high high Ambitions what's the ambition lost souls the sign for those that had the Seal of the Holy Ghost was what those that sigh and cry for Abominations done in the city the Church of the Living God is built high on high Ambitions that's the prophet when I hear of a church that hasn't got any ambition to grow there's something wrong with that church hello ask SW and no more when I hear of a church that hasn't got any ambition to grow there's something wrong with that church the Church of the Living God has got high ambition and another thing the church of living God is built high because it's got high anticipations and high expectations well we belong to the church Our Father served in the church years ago that might be fine but the Church of God can't sit still its ambition is to go higher further oh say Lord lift me up let me stand amen we're going to do more for the kingdom of God this year come on Amen some of you sitting in like Sarah now with unbelief in

because every country has a language yes sir now but the language you were using they would never have known you were a Christian praise the Lord amen praise the Lord every morning you going to the bathroom you change your clothes Hallelujah hey that didn't come out accidental every morning you're going to change your clothes when to put another outfit some people actually got true outfits two wardrobes one for messy's church one for the world he I like to show my legs that goes for men and woman they love to show their legs I don't know for what your leg is for you to walk yeah everyone got legs that's nothing new your leg is there for you to walk say walk praise the Lord his expectation is high somewhere that God will give him a chance to speak to somebody praise the Lord she's got high Ambitions not to please men but to please God hallelujah you're going somewhere what you drifting for get some ambition about you set a goal on Christ and and quit telling with the world oh yeah now yeah the pastor going to get it because we preaching from the P to the Pew and was no I'm preparing this note so I could have left this out he says I haven't got much hopes for a past this church that hasn't got Ambitions to better themselves day by day uh year by year day by day and year by year a church that's really a Church of the Living God will never stop well I just come in I guess it's all right now that ain't the Church of God he's got an ambition to press on well I've done my part I brought one sinner in this year and he got saved brother that's not the ambition of the Church of God Amen if he brings one he wants another another another another there's no end to it it just keeps on climbing up we want to have an ambition and expectation God wants us to be that way Hallelujah so what's our main ambition to spread the gospel amen bringing souls to Christ amen yeah the prophet is talking about you know this uh son of a king amen just the slave buyer came to buy the slaves I want you you to see what gave this man his determination you hear what the prophet is saying he found one of these young fellow there didn't have to whoop him chest out chin up right up and at it all the time he didn't allow his enslaved condition to discourage him he had an ambition of being a king amen while in Chains while in bondage you see what your ambition must be your ambition must be the Rapture the body change the kingdom of God the things of God if somebody's sick my ambition must be the healing of the body if somebody's bound the Deliverance of my loved one have an ambition he knew his father was a king so he carried himself out as a son of a king so I'm saying don't let your current situation dictate to you how you should what your ambition don't let your current condition where you are and the lowliest state that you find yourself in dictates your ambition I put out that picture the other day on the group showing you this boy dressed in ragged clothes but when he sees himself in the mirror he sees himself dressed in a suit he sees himself differently what's our ambition how do we see ourselves amen we're almost coming to an end now he he says my highest ambition and only ambition is to see Jesus Christ glorified I live for that but now I want you to pay attention what I'm saying I am laying these things in there because we are setting up the church for a time of fulfilled promise amen but we can't receive it without an expectation right so I'm laying in the expectation and telling you to realign your sight because this is the year amen amen for the release Hallelujah when the spirit is saying it's an opening of Dimensional Doors you are starting to see Dimensional Doors Open on the earth we just read in Genesis 18 Dimensional Doors were open for Abraham and Sarah for them to receive the promised sand but Dimensional Doors were also open for judgment to come upon Sodom and gomorra and didn't we see it this year already amen did we see judgments coming upon the Earth yes sir you're going to see more so meaning all that was promised whether to the believer or the unbeliever both are going to receive their promise amen that's what Genesis 18 is about solom and gomorra are receiving their promises the bride is receiving their promise hallelujah amen thank you Lord I'm going to continue reading I'm going to continue reading because I don't want it after the service to say that I preached my own message here because I want you to see what the prophet is saying how this church must be now watching all of these things he's not saying that God is highly ambitious and God is doing things we know God is highly ambitious but he works through his body if if he's if our hands don't move he's got no hands if our feet don't move he's got no feet we are the body let's just make it our purpose in life to see that we are the Church of God let's have ambition not set around because the Jones want what do we care if they don't do it let us do it anyhow thank you for that Amen brother Jeff normally a CH a service goes into a pendo but as the responsibility is being placed upon us now how about some of us make it our ambition to say Amen in church am yeah he says if they don't do it let us do it anyhow if the rest of the nation wants to sing that's up to them in Phoenix we stand for God Amen we want to achieve we want to have faith we want to have ambition let's believe on the Lord Jesus Christ he said all things are possible to them that believe verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be mve don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said shall come to pass you can have what you have said I believe with all my heart you believe that and today when the church is sick the sickness is piled on yes and because people because of intellectual Pride he's getting away from Divine Healing that's right we in the third po under the third pull the prophet saw people go into this little room sick stretches wheelchair and they came out healed that's right amen we should not use the third pole as an excuse to say that we have the opening of the word because the power of God not flowing through your ministry you want to shun the power of God amen amen praise the lord lord what is he saying people are getting away from Divine Healing and when they do that what are they doing brother Brandon get away from the old Holy Spirit God still hears the Cry of his people somebody has got to go thank you Lord hallelujah amen watch that same person who's saying that when they get sick they're going to cry out for Divine Healing and they're going to be praying that there's a man of God in on the scene that can believe that these sign shall follow them they believe if they lay hands upon the sick they shall recover they're going to be believing for a man who is able to speak the spoken word that's right Phoenix let's rise and shine in the name of the Lord Jesus if you're sick you say I'm sick in body God has spoken these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover God has spoken it have any ambition so he's saying if you're sick have an ambition to get well don't you say this is my lck that's Fallen to me go re job job was constantly asking the Lord why am I in this condition he had a desire to be healed amen well the doctor said I was going to die what are we going to do curl up and die that's the best the doctor knows he studied every medical research shows that that's all he can do for you so according to Medical SS you're going to die but the prayer of faith shall save the sick yes thank you Lord find your purpose have a purpose that you're going to be healed for the glory of God and I am I got a bone to hallelujah amen amen and this is where God is going to hold those that were healed in 2024 accountable I've seen God heal people miraculously and Jesus had a bone to pick with the people as well when he gave that Parable and he said you remember only one came back to give him thanks and he said but wasn't there more but only one came to say thank you people are ashamed to testify people are saying they're shy people don't testify that God's miraculous hand came and released me God heal me God raiseed me up thank you Lord never a word of thanks thank people are unth thankful it's like oh whatever I could have lived with it SS could have helped me live with the symptoms but I'm saying people are we losing our our consciousness of what God can do his healing power that even when his hand of healing is stretched out amen we can't give him thanks amen we can't give him praise we can't come with the fire of God in our hearts you mean God did nothing for you in 2024 that you couldn't give him thanks and praise amen you mean God did nothing for you the whole year God did nothing for you that you can't give him thanks that you can't give him praise or we just yeah it's expected that's an unthankful child that's somebody who feels entitled The Bride of Jesus Christ is not entitled come on we should never feel entitled I'm saying it again when God touches you you testify about it I'm saying we need to be bold for the kingdom of God amen amen in fact I'm kicking your shinness back into 2024 I'm kicking all of your amen your your your unbelief back into 2024 I don't want it to in 2025 I don't want St sty ways in 2025 you say brother you're saying that you don't want yes God has placed me as a pastor of the church and I'm saying I won't stand for it I won't stand for that that spirit that says oh I'm quiet but I hear you tackling outside in fact we're going to pull you into the front don't come outside and tell me Pastor I got one testimony I know I already believe it I already pray you coming to tell me something I already know has happened but you're supposed to to come here and tell the church about it and tell God about it that you are giving him thanks amen prise the Lord thank you Jesus praise the Lord let us not be unthankful let us not be unly amen praise the Lord I want you to speak already that it has already happened in your life come on now yes what kind of ambitious people are we set an ambition set a number ah some people saying there back bank account no set a number of people you're going to speak to set the number of people Lord by the

for the kingdom of God all those things that you are laboring for all those things that you're going to leave behind and on the earth anyway that's right praise the Lord God will release it to you how if you every day your son has to come beg you for bread your son has to come beg you for food amen those things are just released naturally because you know your responsibility as a father God is our father how if you know the bird said the bird just is a bird the bird goes about doing bird things but the bird has never died from anger that's why Jesus says consider the sparrow consider the Lily but we are go chasing after money thinking that's the source money is not the source amen amen the reason why the bird is successful it fulfills its purpose as a bird amen the reason why Lily is successful it fulfills its Lily uh purpose the reason why we are not achieving what we need to achieve we are we have not been achieving our purpose but being distracted by trying to find something else that's right if we fulfill our purpose the other things will take care of itself so what are we saying a bird is being a bird a lily is being a lily they are fulfilling their purpose so let us be men Hallelujah let us be women that God created us to be so let us fulfill our purpose amen what is our purpose have dominion let us have dominion on the Earthen praise the Lord amen maybe that's for an online audience amen praise the Lord because I don't see anyone connecting with that CH I'm saying find our purpose our purpose is to have dominion our purpose is to rule our purpose amen find our purpose and do your purpose am be a man be a woman have dominion on the earth amen if there's any desire in your heart that you want have any worldly ambition repent of them right now hey you know you and your Prophet are like a wet blanket and now have to go that two pages I have to go home and scratch it out because that thing was filled with worldly Ambitions if there's any desire in your heart that you want have any great worldly ambition repent of them right now tell God your sory that you wanted to be some great worldly person who's receiving this Lord my complete ambition is to be like Jesus hallah come meekly humbly when your hands when you put your hands upon his head your faith and by your faith confess your sin Lord I'm sorry I done it then what will happen God will transfer all your guilt over on him and take your innocence and put it back on you and you stand just ified in the presence of God because you believed on Jesus Christ his son what a Plan of Salvation then you'll

an opposing force in this place right now because it's trying to stop you from coming to your purpose amen it's trying to keep you fixed on worldly Ambitions thank you Jesus yes Lord but I'm praying for a release even now you know what what I'm feeling right now is exactly what we read in Genesis 18 when the Lord told Sarah Sarah was still in unbelief she didn't she wasn't prepared to receive that it was the time of the fulfilled [Music] promise but notice the angel didn't reprimand the angel asked why did you love I'm asking you why did you not say Amen yes Lord while the word was being preached teaching you about your expectation and your ambition and and what should be the heart of the believer why didn't you connect with that word amen yes hallelujah it's going to be done whether you like it or not Sarah oh thank you Jesus you are the chosen vessel thank you Lord God has chosen your body to bring forth the promise it's going to happen anyway is anything too hard for the Lord
