[4:01] praise amen hallelujah amen even as we
[4:04] see the day fast approaching the Bible

[4:43] wonderful amen so this bride you can't
[4:45] play with this bride she's highly
[4:46] revelated amen and she is moving into a
[4:49] manifestation of all that Revelation
[4:52] amen how if you can say amen hallelujah
[4:54] we don't want the word to remain in

[5:02] manifestation amen how long will we just
[5:04] Rejoice around the revelation of the

[5:35] designed to do is to bring light upon
[5:38] the Jee seed and to bring it into
[5:40] manifestation Hallelujah you know
[5:43] there's a quote the prophet says that
[5:45] the first Forerunner pointed to the Lamb
[5:48] of God and said Behold the Lamb of God
[5:50] he says the second
[5:52] Forerunner you now watch what he says he
[5:54] says he won't point to the sky he says
[5:57] he'll point to a word form bride
[6:00] amen because that's Jesus in bright form
[6:03] and he says then she will now look to

[11:34] think that I ever came to the hotel with

[11:39] seon can you imagine so because I was
[11:42] sometimes we be having two Salmons to
[11:45] preach you don't know which one must I
[11:47] preach and then something just happens
[11:50] and God tells you preach this one and
[11:52] when I was with a man of God in the
[11:55] study there you know he was confirming
[11:58] again even what he was saying here his
[12:01] remarks he was just confirming what I
[12:03] wanted to talk about Hallelujah so let's
[12:07] just go straight to the word
[12:08] amen you

[12:18] where Christ is welcome I'm also welcome
[12:21] Hallelujah so God bless you Pastor for

[13:10] Aran you know even me I remember you
[13:13] know the Bible says shama the son of AI
[13:17] the harite so har was in the Bible so
[13:22] I'm a
[13:23] harite amen so Matthew 4 verse 16
[13:31] let's start from verse 15 he says the
[13:35] land of zapan and the land of napim by
[13:39] the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee
[13:42] of the Gentiles the people which set in
[13:45] darkness saw great light and to them
[13:49] which set in in the region of the shadow
[13:52] of death light is sprung up amen we may
[13:56] be seated so we are talking about the
[13:59] Vindicated light of this day amen amen
[14:03] the Vindicated light of this day amen
[14:06] amen I'm happy to see brother calb
[14:10] Hallelujah so I I thought I was going to
[14:13] see that little girl Hallelujah but we
[14:17] believe all is well amen hallelujah amen
[14:21] so I just want to go straight H to the
[14:24] word of
[14:25] God let's read in the message God's word
[14:29] it cause for a total separation from
[14:31] unbelief
[14:34] 64121 paragraph 10 says now if God said
[14:38] let they be light and there was no light
[14:42] then that isn't that wasn't God said
[14:47] that see when God says anything he must
[14:52] back up brother he must back up what he
[14:57] says so do you see brother Adrian what
[15:00] you were saying I feel that the devil is
[15:03] finished already hallah we are in the
[15:06] will of God we are not here by
[15:09] coincidence Hallelujah if God says
[15:12] something he must back up what he has
[15:15] said amen how many believe that amen
[15:18] amen amen praise the Lord praise God if
[15:22] God said H let they be light and there
[15:26] was no light huh how are being blessed
[15:30] When God says anything he must back up
[15:34] what he says and when the word of God
[15:38] has been a Vindicated yes hey the
[15:43] word hallelujah been a
[15:46] Vindicated that is light so what is
[15:50] light is the Vindicated word of God is
[15:53] the manifested word of God hallelujah if
[15:57] the word is not manifest
[15:59] then that's not light we are not talking
[16:02] about this electricity that's not the
[16:04] light the light is the word of God that
[16:08] has been
[16:10] manifested that has been
[16:12] Vindicated so we are not talking about
[16:15] the prophecy we are talking about the
[16:18] manifestation of the prophecy we are
[16:21] living in the days of the
[16:24] manifestation of the prophecy amen how
[16:27] many can say Amen oh I like that Pastor
[16:31] Den amen the word has been what
[16:35] Vindicated amen that is light brother KH
[16:41] if the word is not manifested if the
[16:44] word is not Vindicated then we are not
[16:47] walking in the light when we say brother
[16:49] Esko we are walking in the light we are
[16:52] walking in the
[16:57] Vindicated hallelujah hallelujah
[16:59] while brother is resting
[17:03] hallelujah
[17:04] [Music]
[17:05] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen praise
[17:09] the Lord hey I'm enjoying are you happy
[17:12] my
[17:13] brother
[17:15] amen oh my pastor denel now the word i a
[17:21] a
[17:23] listen now the
[17:26] word itself
[17:29] H this is a
[17:31] bomb I can't now the word itself is in
[17:37] Delight until it's a Vindicated
[17:41] Delight hallelujah hallelujah the word
[17:46] itself isn't light until it's Vindicated
[17:51] amen can I repeat it again oh pastor
[17:55] this is serious how many can say amen
[17:58] amen
[17:59] this is what you were saying in the
[18:02] car so I was just listening while we
[18:04] were just fellowshipping you were just
[18:06] confirming my message hallelujah
[18:10] amen
[18:12] hallelujah amen how been blessed amen
[18:15] yes sir
[18:17] now huh are we being blessed amen huh he
[18:23] said yeah so yeah I I just skipped it
[18:27] now the way itself isn't light until
[18:32] it's a Vindicated
[18:35] light hallelujah amen so when we say
[18:39] when we just preach the word alone it's
[18:42] not enough amen hallelujah can I say
[18:44] this Hallelujah Pastor H listen the
[18:48] Bible is the word of God hallu are we
[18:52] together but the message of the hour is
[18:57] the will of God for
[19:00] the whole Bible is not the will of God
[19:03] for us the Bible is the word of God but
[19:06] the scriptures of our day how many can
[19:09] say Amen the message of the hour is the
[19:12] will of God for you and me the whole
[19:16] word the whole Bible how many can say
[19:19] Amen cannot help you how many can say
[19:22] Amen but the message of the hour how
[19:25] many can say Amen is the will of God for
[19:29] you and me that's why brother Pam says
[19:33] Noah if he had come with Jesus message
[19:36] it was not going to help neither could
[19:38] Jesus come with Moses message we have
[19:42] the message of our day Hallelujah so if
[19:45] the word for today is manifested that's
[19:49] the
[19:50] light when John the Baptist was asked
[19:53] what sayest thou of thyself are you the
[19:56] one or shall we wait for another he
[19:58] never said I am John the Baptist no you
[20:01] know those people were asking him they
[20:03] knew that he was John
[20:06] zakariah even the people who took who
[20:09] helped him to get the the passport and
[20:12] the birth certificate they knew he was
[20:14] John Zachariah but when they said who
[20:17] are you what says Thou of thyself they
[20:20] were not expecting him to say John zakar
[20:23] they wanted his scriptural
[20:26] identification hallelujah how many can
[20:28] say
[20:29] you must know you know you
[20:31] not
[20:34] not I have my scripture
[20:37] identification hallelujah how many can
[20:39] say amen hallelujah amen amen how many
[20:45] are
[20:46] enjoying huh pastor this is too much man
[20:50] now the word I can close here the word
[20:54] itself is in light amen until it's what
[20:59] a Vindicated light and can I say this
[21:02] how many can say amen amen there is a
[21:05] spoken word hallelujah there is a what a
[21:09] written word and there is also a
[21:12] manifested word and I also want to say
[21:16] the spoken word as good as it is it
[21:19] cannot help you the written word as good
[21:23] as it is it cannot help you what will
[21:25] help you is the manifested way
[21:29] how many sayuj Hallelujah we want the
[21:33] spoken word to be manifested we want the
[21:37] written word to be
[21:39] manifested hallelujah oh Pastor Denzel
[21:43] do you know that the Pharisees were
[21:44] preaching every Sabbath the virin shall
[21:48] conceive virin shall conceive it did not
[21:51] help them but listen it's easy to see to
[21:55] to believe the spoken word it's easy to
[21:58] to believe the man the written word but
[22:02] it's not easy to believe the manifested
[22:07] word Glory you go to the denominations
[22:10] now and read to them behold I send you
[22:13] Elijah they will say Amen to that but if
[22:17] you say Elijah he has come Elijah is
[22:20] here and he malach 4 ah his brother B
[22:24] that's where the problem
[22:26] start you started well but you said this
[22:28] man great seven he is the Elijah you see
[22:31] now it's easy to believe Malachi 4 when
[22:36] it is being preached but when you say
[22:38] the men behold the men Ah that's where
[22:42] the problem
[22:43] is if we preach about the kind Gentlemen
[22:46] people will rejoice but if I say behold
[22:49] the kind gentlemen say no no no maybe I
[22:53] think he must be from America or
[22:55] something how if you say behold that
[22:58] kind
[22:59] if you say that kind gentleman is here
[23:01] how many can say Amen it's not easy my
[23:04] brother you you think it's easy to
[23:07] believe that the spoken word is easy to
[23:10] believe the written word is easy but to
[23:14] believe how
[23:16] many
[23:18] manifested
[23:20] it
[23:22] hallu the Pharisees were always
[23:24] rejoicing RAB rski thees were always
[23:28] saying a virgin shall conceive every
[23:31] Sabbath but when the Virgin conceived
[23:34] they never saw it they stoned that
[23:37] virgin They Crucified the Virgin so it's
[23:40] the grace of God it takes an
[23:43] predestinated seed of God to see the
[23:46] word of God manifested how many can say
[23:49] Amen am hey brother M when you see
[23:53] scriptures being fulfilled is the grace
[23:55] of God it's not easy yes

[24:18] stood up and said these men are not
[24:21] drunk this is that which was prophesied
[24:26] by the prophet Jo
[24:29] so what is the Holy Ghost the
[24:30] Fulfillment of scripture how many can
[24:33] say am this is that amen this is what we
[24:38] are supposed to be saying now when we
[24:40] see people being healed we see the
[24:42] manifestation of the third po then
[24:45] brother es said this is that which was
[24:49] prophesied by
[24:50] man

[1:00:10] oh la in the message H God's only
[1:00:14] provided place of worship
[1:00:17] 65128 a.m. watch now I was sitting over
[1:00:22] there talking to my old friend brother
[1:00:26] Brown while the songs was going on like
[1:00:29] when the the pastor was in the study
[1:00:32] there you know while the songs was going
[1:00:34] on brother Bram was in the study and
[1:00:36] brother Brown something happened to him
[1:00:39] he rushed to the what to the office of
[1:00:41] the prophet he said no I don't care I'm
[1:00:44] prepared to break protocol today just
[1:00:47] entered into the into his office he says
[1:00:50] I was sitting over there talking to my
[1:00:52] old friend brother Brown while the songs
[1:00:54] was going on and and he said brother
[1:00:58] Bram I never seen it till
[1:01:02] yesterday what you have been talking
[1:01:04] about he said If people could
[1:01:08] grasp H If people could get into what
[1:01:13] you are speaking about said every
[1:01:17] obstacle will move out of the way that's
[1:01:20] exactly right that's right it's exactly
[1:01:24] right if you could just grasp it could
[1:01:28] catch it so I want to say church if you
[1:01:31] could grasp what was being said
[1:01:34] Hallelujah during the Easter if you
[1:01:36] could grasp what your pastors are always
[1:01:38] preaching if you could grasp what
[1:01:40] brother Bram is always talking about
[1:01:43] every obstacle will move out of the way
[1:01:47] the power of
[1:01:49] knowledge if you can grasp why the seals
[1:01:53] were open amen every OB the go will go
[1:01:57] you know it struck me Pastor Denzel so
[1:01:59] it means he was always coming to church
[1:02:02] not understanding what brother was
[1:02:04] talking about but something was revealed
[1:02:07] to him how many can say Amen I'm telling
[1:02:10] you even the the the prodal son you know
[1:02:14] do you know what redeems you do you know
[1:02:16] what delivers you is not being prayed
[1:02:18] for if a revelation strikes you you are
[1:02:22] delivered that's why even the Bible it
[1:02:25] says the got eyes but they can't see
[1:02:27] they've got ears but they can't hear
[1:02:30] Hallelujah and the Bible says let
[1:02:32] they've got eyes and they can't see L
[1:02:37] they see and understand and be healed
[1:02:41] and be converted this is the The Secret
[1:02:44] of being healed and being converted is
[1:02:47] not all about prayer meetings but if you
[1:02:50] catch it that's why someone says I
[1:02:53] understand it I've caught it then you
[1:02:54] are how many can say so we are preaching
[1:02:58] so that you catch it if you can only
[1:03:00] catch it then everything is
[1:03:03] over halluel is preaching Hallelujah and
[1:03:07] then you understand it then you are
[1:03:10] healed because the Bible says so God
[1:03:13] blinded their understanding so that they
[1:03:16] don't get converted but when you see it
[1:03:19] you understand it you are healed you are
[1:03:22] delivered you are converted how many can
[1:03:25] say Amen amen that's our purpose I'm
[1:03:28] preaching so that you understand it so
[1:03:31] that that's why sometimes I can come
[1:03:32] with what five or 10 quotations but
[1:03:35] sometimes I just read two and I see
[1:03:37] people have got it they've got it I go I
[1:03:40] don't have to continue I know how many
[1:03:43] can say amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:03:47] amen how many can say Amen the Lord do
[1:03:50] you believe it amen the light of this
[1:03:53] day Pastor Denzel
[1:03:56] this is too much man and I want to show
[1:03:59] you something huh how do you get healed
[1:04:04] huh how you do you get forgiven I have
[1:04:07] to read this quotation Hallelujah listen
[1:04:10] when the man of God is revealing the
[1:04:12] world are we together and you catch it
[1:04:16] yes listen it's good to repent it's good
[1:04:19] to come to the altar it's good to do
[1:04:21] that but what Hallelujah will cleanse
[1:04:25] you of your sins is accepting the
[1:04:29] Revelation if you don't accept the
[1:04:31] Revelation the little light that you
[1:04:34] have is taken away do you hear what I'm
[1:04:37] saying can I read it so I was telling
[1:04:39] someone I said you do you know that if
[1:04:42] you catch the revelation of the seventh
[1:04:44] seal seven Thunders and all those things
[1:04:46] whatever sin you have it will be
[1:04:49] cleansed how many listen in the message
[1:04:53] the identified Christ of all ages so
[1:04:55] that why I'm talking about the light of
[1:04:57] this age so listen the reason why we say
[1:05:01] we are walking in the light it's not
[1:05:03] that we are gathered here but we C the
[1:05:05] message of our day how many can say Amen
[1:05:09] then we are moving in the what in the
[1:05:12] light that's the difference between us
[1:05:14] and the world there because we see the
[1:05:17] manifestation of the word which was
[1:05:20] promised for our day that's why we are
[1:05:22] saying we are walking in the what in the
[1:05:24] light amen how many can say amen and
[1:05:27] that light it cleanses your sins and
[1:05:32] those who reject the light hallelujah
[1:05:35] what happens to them the little light
[1:05:37] that they have is taken away from them
[1:05:40] listen
[1:05:41] now Pastor Adrian
[1:05:45] 64401 the identified Christ of all ages
[1:05:49] listen he look at Jesus Oh that we know
[1:05:54] he was the Manifest word of God we
[1:05:57] believe that the Bible said it was well
[1:06:01] watch when he done his messic sign so
[1:06:05] when he did it to the predestinated say
[1:06:08] sir I perceive you are the Messiah what
[1:06:10] did he do to him and when the same was
[1:06:13] done to the Pharisees rosis they said
[1:06:17] your B above it condemned them listen
[1:06:20] now listen the Pharisees that had a
[1:06:24] little bit of life
[1:06:26] there was good people lived good
[1:06:28] Christian Life or a good religious life
[1:06:31] so if you dress well live right and do
[1:06:34] everything right there is a little light
[1:06:36] that comes H because of just living
[1:06:39] right that's what the Pharisees had a
[1:06:41] little light because of a religious life
[1:06:43] a good Christian Life had a little light
[1:06:46] about them they had organized and a
[1:06:49] priesthood they had a little light but
[1:06:53] down in the bottom of their heart they
[1:06:55] no Eternal representation in glory so
[1:06:59] when listen when they seen that
[1:07:02] Supernatural
[1:07:05] Pastor they said this man is b a devil
[1:07:10] listen now what happened that put what
[1:07:14] light they had out so this is a
[1:07:18] dangerous hour where we are living when
[1:07:20] people reject the revealed word reject
[1:07:23] the second coming reject the word the
[1:07:26] light of this day it puts out the little
[1:07:29] light that they have that's a dangerous
[1:07:33] thing
[1:07:34] but there was a little infed woman the
[1:07:38] opposite is also true a prostitute down
[1:07:41] in her heart well she had a
[1:07:44] representation of one of God's thoughts
[1:07:48] there she was wicked in sin but when she
[1:07:53] seen that happen she said say I believe
[1:07:58] you are a prophet I know when the
[1:08:01] Messiah cometh he will tell us these
[1:08:04] things what did it do Brother P says it
[1:08:09] cleansed her life so what cleanses is
[1:08:12] not evangelism what cleanses is catching
[1:08:17] the revealed the light of your day if
[1:08:20] you catch it it cleanses your life amen
[1:08:25] what did do Pastor es it cleansed her
[1:08:28] life Pastor adri these things that you
[1:08:32] are preaching this divinely revealed
[1:08:34] mystery truths it's cleansing the bride
[1:08:38] so if we don't preach these things how
[1:08:40] will the church be cleansed church can
[1:08:43] you say
[1:08:45] amen that's the issue friends so you
[1:08:48] must appreciate these deep messages you
[1:08:51] must appreciate the Revelation because
[1:08:54] revelation
[1:08:56] cleanses and rejecting the Revelation
[1:08:59] puts away the little light that you have
[1:09:02] so we can preach another indictment our
[1:09:06] indictment brother Bram indicted the
[1:09:08] people of his day but we when we Reve
[1:09:12] the word of our day and say who is
[1:09:17] this Mighty God before that and people
[1:09:21] say nonsense Hallelujah then it puts
[1:09:24] away the little light of the long
[1:09:28] dresses of the shalom shalom it puts out
[1:09:32] how many can say Amen can I read my last
[1:09:36] scripture which I believe will be a
[1:09:39] blessing to someone let's go to Genesis
[1:09:41] chapter 45 hallelujah amen Genesis 45
[1:09:46] I'll just read this and call my pastor
[1:09:48] how many are been blessed how many are
[1:09:51] enjoying how many are going to mix this
[1:09:54] with their faith
[1:09:56] how many are going to mix this with
[1:09:57] their faith you know as I as I preach
[1:10:00] like this because the preaching of the
[1:10:01] word is the casting out of demons and
[1:10:04] you are receiving your desires
[1:10:07] Hallelujah we are in the days of remote
[1:10:09] controls how many can say Amen we're in
[1:10:12] an astronaut age and you know sometimes
[1:10:14] you might think nothing happened brother
[1:10:17] great things they happen in silence how
[1:10:20] many can say Amen you are going to call
[1:10:22] me you are going to tell the pastor that
[1:10:24] day when the word was preached something
[1:10:27] happened the cancer disappeared we
[1:10:30] talking about the manifestation you know
[1:10:32] of the word the word must become flesh
[1:10:36] so whatever condition you are in whether
[1:10:39] you are sick whether whatever it is we
[1:10:42] want to see the manifestation today am
[1:10:46] amen Genesis
[1:10:48] 45 I know it blessed my soul when I read
[1:10:52] this you know when Joseph was in Egypt
[1:10:56] you know that Joseph his father Jacob he
[1:11:00] thought he was dead you remember his
[1:11:02] brothers came with a blood with a jacket
[1:11:06] mingled it with blood they said this is
[1:11:09] your the son's jacket and he said oh
[1:11:11] surely my my my son has been devoured by
[1:11:14] beasts and everything and Jacob cried
[1:11:17] how many can say Amen but Joseph was
[1:11:21] alive in Egypt he was not dead how many
[1:11:24] can say Amen
[1:11:26] to move what elements watch now I just
[1:11:29] go straight to that so now when he
[1:11:32] became right men of pharaoh when he
[1:11:34] became great and you know the story they
[1:11:37] came to Egypt and he recognized his
[1:11:40] brothers but they could not recognize
[1:11:42] him and you know the dramas can I drop
[1:11:44] this it's just coming
[1:11:46] fresh listen Joseph H he took the silver
[1:11:51] cup of the youngest of Benjamin hey
[1:11:55] sorry his silver cup his treasure he put
[1:11:58] it in the s in the Bank of what of
[1:12:01] Benjamin listen now and then he said to
[1:12:06] his people these people are spies follow
[1:12:09] them they stole my word and then he says
[1:12:12] the one that we will find with the cup
[1:12:15] we are taking him and you you go and
[1:12:17] Judah knew he had said I'm going to be
[1:12:20] responsible for Benjamin remember Jacob
[1:12:23] said Simeon is not Joseph is not now you
[1:12:25] want to take Benjamin all these things
[1:12:27] are against me if Benjamin doesn't come
[1:12:30] you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow
[1:12:32] to the Grave so it was like Joseph was
[1:12:35] hearing the
[1:12:37] conversation say and then he takes the
[1:12:39] what the silver cup to he put it to
[1:12:42] Benjamin his real brother watch now
[1:12:46] there was a countdown when they say stop
[1:12:48] you guys spise your thieves the
[1:12:51] countdown began because the countdown is
[1:12:53] always from 10 9 8 until Z so listen to
[1:12:57] what they did they started with the
[1:13:00] eldest the countdown started with what
[1:13:03] the eldest Reuben they cuted nothing
[1:13:07] happened there was no silver cup they

[1:13:11] brother es until they reach to the
[1:13:14] youngest how many say they cut the bag
[1:13:18] then they saw ah the silver cup the
[1:13:21] treasure the one that he was using to
[1:13:23] drink tea
[1:13:26] so even in our age how many can say Amen
[1:13:30] there was Treasure that was looked after
[1:13:33] people were looking after these things
[1:13:35] the the seals the thir P everything and
[1:13:38] they started the countdown they started
[1:13:40] with Paul and Paul says I know in part I
[1:13:43] prophesy in part how many they could
[1:13:46] find the treasure of the thir po of the
[1:13:49] seven even Daniel he said when shall
[1:13:52] these things be he says go thy way for
[1:13:55] these things for the end time the cles
[1:13:58] of old they were waiting they wanted to

[1:16:56] brother how many can say am so listen to
[1:16:59] this he says this as I close God bless
[1:17:02] you church so Joseph now he sends his
[1:17:05] father with wons with everything he
[1:17:08] sends his brothers to go and collect his
[1:17:10] what his father but his father thought
[1:17:13] he is what he was dead let's start from
[1:17:16] verse 25 he
[1:17:18] says and they went up out of Egypt I
[1:17:21] want you to see something and come into
[1:17:24] the land sorry I'm just closing maybe 2
[1:17:26] minutes into the land of Canaan unto
[1:17:29] Jacob his father they've arrived now the
[1:17:32] Bible says they came with wagons of
[1:17:36] Egypt listen and told him so they packed
[1:17:41] the what the wagons and the good things
[1:17:44] of Egypt outside and they went to the
[1:17:46] bedroom of his father and told him
[1:17:49] saying Jacob is alive is yet alive and
[1:17:52] he is Governor over all the land of
[1:17:56] Egypt and Jacob's heart fainted for he
[1:18:00] believed them not let K it but the
[1:18:03] spirit gives life he did not believe
[1:18:06] them why because the word did not come
[1:18:08] in word only but in demonstration watch
[1:18:12] now hey this is serious now listen verse
[1:18:15] 27 and they told him all the words of
[1:18:19] Joseph which he had said unto them and
[1:18:23] when listen now when Jacob saw the
[1:18:26] wons which Joseph had sent to carry amen
[1:18:32] the spirit of Jacob their father revived
[1:18:36] amen what revived him what brings a
[1:18:39] Revival when the world is made flesh
[1:18:42] when the listen how I'm talking about
[1:18:45] the evidence of the Resurrection how
[1:18:48] many can say if Jesus is Alive where are
[1:18:52] the wons what are the
[1:18:56] that's why your neighbors your father
[1:18:58] your relatives they don't believe this
[1:19:00] message because you just talk brother
[1:19:03] did this in res brother went to De he
[1:19:07] did this he went to Switzerland you are
[1:19:09] just talking without the evidence
[1:19:12] without the wons so Jo listen so his
[1:19:16] children when they said Father Joseph is
[1:19:19] alive Hallelujah so when he never saw
[1:19:22] anything he fainted for the letter kill
[1:19:26] but they open the window and say father
[1:19:29] look amen and the Bible says when Jacob
[1:19:32] saw the wons Hallelujah which Joseph had
[1:19:36] sent to carry him his Spirit was revived
[1:19:40] what did he say and Israel said it is
[1:19:44] enough Joseph my son is yet alive I will
[1:19:49] go and see him before I die so Jacob
[1:19:53] believed that Joseph was alive before he
[1:19:56] saw him but what was those wons the
[1:20:00] evidence of the Resurrection so even the
[1:20:03] people before they see the Lord Jesus
[1:20:05] Christ when they see Hallelujah you
[1:20:08] healed of cancer those are the W Gods
[1:20:11] when we see Pastor Denzel's Hallelujah
[1:20:15] he and healed and everything his
[1:20:19] relatives will say it is enough hey
[1:20:23] Jesus is
[1:20:25] how can say Amen so I want to see the
[1:20:28] here today we want to see the of Joseph
[1:20:33] hallelu if Joseph is alive where is
[1:20:36] wles
[1:20:38] hallelujah where is Miracles where is
[1:20:41] the god of Elijah how many say am tell
[1:20:45] your neighbor and say come on I want to
[1:20:47] see the how many can say Amen what made
[1:20:51] Joseph Jacob to believe he saw th God b
[1:20:55] h he says it's enough so when people see
[1:20:58] you are heal you are healed you almost
[1:21:00] dying and they were refusing to come to
[1:21:02] the message when you are healed they
[1:21:04] will say it is enough Jesus is Alive
[1:21:08] baptize me now so what makes people not
[1:21:12] to come and be baptized they seeing
[1:21:14] people who are just talking how many can
[1:21:16] say Amen tell your neighbor where are
[1:21:18] the wons where are the wons let stand
