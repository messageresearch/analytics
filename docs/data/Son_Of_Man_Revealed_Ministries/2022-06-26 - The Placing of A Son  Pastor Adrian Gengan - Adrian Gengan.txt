========================================

pray in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask His blessings amen amen amen hallelujah amen let's turn to the book of Galatians chapter 4 and verse one amen Galatians chapter 4 and verse 1 and it reads thus now I say that an heir as long as he is a child defer nothing from his servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has set forth the spirit of his sons into your hearts crying our father I want you to know that's a special place to be able to cry Our Father there are many people who desert their children but God has not deserted his sons and his daughters amen we are redeemable attributes of God and he says wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen another portion of scripture in Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 4 it says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen it's not our own choosing but the Bible says he had chosen us hallelujah it's not him that willth not him that runneth but God that showeth Mercy amen and what did he chose us choose us for to be holy amen it's not our own Holiness but he had chosen us to be holy and he had chosen us to be without blame before him in love we stand here this morning blameless before the Lord God Almighty because of the shed blood of Jesus Christ and having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what did he choose us for for a purpose what did he predestinate us for unto adoption of sons amen hallelujah you may be seated may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word amen so this morning we'll for a little title we just speak on on the placing of sons amen the placing of sons and like we read in the book of Galatians we find that in the Old Testament when a man married and he he took a wife and he bought children this was called his house sold and he had a little kingdom he was the father of that Kingdom and the children that were born into his home were placed under tutors amen they were placed under a teacher under an instructor because this boy was going to inherit all that the father had so the father had to make certain that he could trust his son so he took to his place over this boy to educate him to raise him up to teach him the ways of the father amen and but he was remember he's a born son in the house but he still has same rights as a servant he's just a son amen and he is no more than a servant until he comes to an age where this tutor will now give a report back to father of how the son is progressing now if the tutor went to the father and said your boy is not doing very good I'm trying to teach him he won't listen he's got a headstrong way about him he just won't listen he's going after the things of the world he's going ahead and following his own will and not willing to follow my instruction and he's putting his own interpretation to everything I'm telling him the father is not going to be confident amen the F because the father knows that this boy is going to squander the family inheritance he's not going to be a good Steward over all the father has Amen brother if you can just follow along in the slides there amen you'll pick up the quotes I'm going through most of these things I'm taking as quotes but I'm paraphrasing it amen so when the father becomes aware of this report he is not too confident about the sun because the sun could mortgage off the farm he could sell it he could drink all the money and he could run around the father realizes then that this boy cannot take control of my domain but when the father is aware of this report he doesn't dishone him as a son he's still his boy but he could place no confidence in him amen and if he wasn't a worthy son the father could not adopt him nor place him in his family he's a Restless child he doesn't have the ability to carry the the father's work so the father just lets him go on being a son amen most of these thoughts you find in the position of a believer in Christ amen and the prophet says that's where Pentecost failed amen they they received the Holy Spirit but they were not willing to go further amen they they when they were born again with the ho spirit and receive the initial evidence of speaking in tongues they settled with that portion of the ministry they didn't want to progress further and that's they said this is it brother you were a child but you were just as much as child as you could ever be but you were born into the family but yet the tutor which is the holy spirit he watched over the church has it's been maturing now in contrast maybe the boy got a good report back back and the day came when this boy maybe had been right and a worthy man he listened to his father he took the instructions he was a good boy then the father took him into the public Street and he put special clothes on him and then the father had a ceremony and adopted the son into his family and then the son is no longer like a servant under a tutor he's now the the boss amen the son is no no longer under tutor but he is just like his daddy he holds the same Authority he holds the same power amen and the father gives him certain things to do the father now gives him responsibilities amen the father tells him these sign shall follow you that believe if you cast out demons amen hallelujah [Applause] if you lay hands upon the sick they shall recover the father starts to give you responsibilities hallelujah amen if you say to this mountain be moved and cast into the sea it shall happen the father starts to give you responsibilities amen hallelujah then amen he tells him you can take over the field here you can do this you can take care of the slave you can take care of whatever it is he is in full possession because he is adopted into the family and his name on the check is just as good as Daddy signing the name amen hallelujah the prophet of God tells us he says now in the spiritual sense after we are born into Christ we become children of God now this boy after he got to a certain age had to to be adopted into the same family he was born into any Minister knows that's the placing of a son then the prophet tells us we have a very good example in the prodigal son in Luke 15 now remember Luke 15 the father has two sons sir hallelujah amen and the younger of them said father give me me the portion of my goods that F fall to me and he divided unto them his living when was this after the tutor had given the report after he had come of age and he didn't want to stay in father's house he didn't want to stay in the confines of the word this was a type of the Pentecostal church amen after the initial outpouring of the Holy Spirit on in the day of Pentecost amen Acts 2 amen when they came a sound from heaven like a mighty rushing wind and it filled one and all amen he said give me the portion of this goods and he settled for a Pentecostal outpouring the initial evidence of speaking in tongues and he didn't want nothing else to do with the father hallu he didn't know know the father had many other blessings in store amen because the holy ghost in the land of the Holy Ghost there is plentiful blessings spiritual blessings amen if we can only find our place in Christ there's just not one blessing for the believer but the L the Holy Ghost which is the land of our inheritance as is a land flowing with milk and honey hallelujah amen hallelujah and the Bible says not many days the youngest son gathered all that he had together and he took his journey into a far country and he wasted the substance with righteous living what was he doing now he's going on a seven stage journey to his demise he's leaving his first love like Ephesians did amen amen he's leaving his first love he's leaving his father's house and he goes on the seventh stage of his falling away from the original Faith like the church did now we typing it with the church amen remember the parable is a Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning amen so we can find on his journey where he is in his Journey if we pick up the seven Church ages and God Said Amen to him I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love amen under the second stage of his journey amen he is experiencing tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich I know the blasphemy of them would say they are Jews and are not but are the syn go of Satan he began to dabble in amen other religions amen what was it it was a image being formed unto the Beast you economical move amen We Are All One worship together under the stage St third stage of his journey I have a few things against thee because thou Hast them here you hold to the doctrine of balum watch how he was slipping away from the faith he was holding to the doctrine of balum Amen with Tau BAC and to cast his stumbling block before the children of Israel he started to eat things that were sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication amen he started to hold to the doctrine of the nicians and it's a thing that God hated amen and under that fourth stage of the journey he met that woman Jezebel and she called herself a prophetess and she began to teach him and seduce him to commit fornication and eat the thing sacrificed to idols and God was just pleased with his walk and he says I will kill the children with death what is that tieria they all but died out that's the fourth stage of the journey kill the children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he who searched the reins and the hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but he was slipping further and further away from father's home from the original teachings all that the two had been training up for all these years he was leaving it but God is not one to be defeated amen because this boy was a son from before the foundation of the world Amen he wasn't made a son when he was born but he was in the back parts of God's mind amen you may Wonder from God but if you are a predestinated son of God you will have to turn around and come back to Father's House amen we find here now under the fifth stage of the journey there's an admonishment given to him it says strengthen the things which remain amen strengthen the things which remain so God started a work in the boy's life and he sent forth Luther amen and Luther found a text in the Bible and the only thing that remained because the Catholic church had taken away the word from the people but Luther began to strengthen himself with the things that remained and he saw in the Bible the just shall live by faith he had a little strength amen amen he preached the message of justification amen hallelujah amen but the Lord goes on to say I have not found thy works perfect before God so justification just alone just wouldn't do it there had to be another stage in the journey amen so God sent forth Wesley amen with a message of sanctification and he went back on Horseback preaching sanctification another work of Grace amen what was this amen I have set before thee an open door Hallelujah and no man can shut it that message of sanctification still holds strong strong today because God had opened up the door of a Sanctified Holy Ghost fill life and no man can shut it hallelujah amen hallelujah oh bless the name of Jesus Amen now watch it goes on to say you you have a little strength so Wesley still have strength but it was a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name aren't you glad that we did not deny the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen when it comes to baptism we are not ashamed of the name amen while other people who are not sons are confused about the name amen we know the name of the father son and the holy spirit amen hallelujah and on the seventh stage of his journey he ended up in a pitiful condition it says I Know Thy works you are neither cold nor hot I would that there were cold or hot but because thou are lukewarm and neither cold or hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because you said I am rich increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou wretched miserable poor blind and naked and that brings us to Luke 15:15 he found himself in a latan condition and the Bible says says he joined himself to a citizen of that country a leosan spirit look what this citizen did to him he didn't take him into his home and give him room in the house and that's what the latan spirit will do to you it will strip you naked that you won't even know it amen we will be miserable wretched naked blind but he joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him in the field to feed swines now look at what a contrast this is with the Good Samaritan the Good Samaritan found this man laying on the floor and what did he do they stripped him of his reignment and hounded him and depart leaving him half dead but they said the priest came by he didn't touch him no doubt Revival after Revival swept through that pig pen that day AA Allen Oral Roberts bully Graham all we having revivals amen hallelujah but none of the priests none of the Levites they came and looked at him but they passed the other way amen but they came a Samaritan hallelujah amen there came a Samaritan and as he journeyed he came he saw the man and he had compassion and he went to him and he bound up his hounds I have come to bind up the brokenhearted to set at Liberty those that are captive amen hallelujah he had compassion on him and what did he do he was pouring oil and wine oil speaks of the Holy Ghost and wine speaks of the stimulation of Revelation this was another kind of ministry sir amen hallelujah what is this amen hallelujah third seal oil and wine amen oh bless the name of Jesus and he set him on his own beast and he brought him into an hen and he took care of him he was not like the citizen who threw the prodical son into a pig pen but here he took him and he paid the price and listen to what the Bible says and on on the tomorrow when he departed he took two pence and he gave them to the host catch this now first and second pull sign in the hand Discerning the spirit he gave him two pens Hallelujah two PS were in operation to take care of him but watch the third he gave him two pens and he gave them to the host saying take care of him here's the third coming now and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay the third has to be operated by you amen the third Pence because the inkeeper had two pens first and second pull but we are not satisfied with just two pulls we are going to make a request from the in keeper amen that we want the third pool [Applause] Hallelujah because the first pool was reaching to the five senses he would take them by the hand the second pool designed the spirit of man but that third pool amen went deep down into the soul and it brought that genene seed of God that was within us germinated the life but but it's for you to operate the word was given to the inkeeper if he ask for anything more if you say if you say he could have been sitting there and just been content with the two pence but he required further treatment amen and whatsoever he desired amen he knew that the price was paid made in full father has left an open checkbook for you this morning will you sign your name on it and give a claim let the great enforcer take it to the father this morning amen oh don't sit and wonder this morning amen but get involved in the service say Amen somebody hallelujah oh I pray your mind is not on the bride right now we are having some nice hot dog rolls right now amen we are having a nice big juicy steak right now amen so get involved with the service amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the third part was left for the man to operate and to speak another word hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen now verse 17 brings us to this it says now we gone back to the Prodigal Son can you imagine he's looking around and all he sees is pigs have you seen the squala that a pig lives in hallelujah it's filthy and he's laying there next to him is pig mess this side is pig amen that's amen and he says the Bible says when he came to himself something took away his Amnesia it will take those seven unknown Thunders to wake her up [Applause] again something awoke the boy he came to himself and he said how many I Servants of my father's house have bread enough to eat amen and I perish with Hunger why are you sitting here hungry this morning when the word has been opened up to us amen oh a seven cuse meal has been given to us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh praise be to God and he said say I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee amen you need to arise out of your condition this morning you need to arise out of your sickness this morning and come to Father's House you need to arise from that house of depression you need to arise from that troubled spirit and that broken heart that wounded spirit Spirit you need to arise from that suicidal thoughts and thinking that nobody loves you and the whole world is against you [Applause] arise amen hallelujah oh but something was happening and as he day says I will arise he hears an eagle scream hallelujah amen and she swooped down with a tremendous speed and screamed at the top of her voice for him to fly up to meet her but he had never heard a heagle cry before Hallelujah watch the way the Prophet dramatizes this now he also brings in the three pools here he says she came and swooped in one time but he was afraid like many are this morning are afraid to just say an amen somebody might hear my voice somebody might think I'm holy somebody might think I'm Holy Ghost filled somebody might think I'm drunk but these are not drunk like you suppose seeing that it's the third hour of the day but this is that that was spoken by the prophet brandham that in the last days there will come another group of people in the land again who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah oh when he heard that first scream something in within him stirred he says that sounds like father's house oh Hallelujah it sounds like that tutor back in father's house and he longed to launch out but he was afraid to try oh this morning I pray your faith will be built up again the mother screamed the eagle screamed and the rise in the wind would follow her and screamed but he was afraid that's the second pull but she made one more sweep amen hallelujah and she says once more she called out screaming that he tried beating his wings he h himself into the air answering the Cry of mother Eagle come out of her my people be not partakers of her sin oh Hallelujah you see he was always an eagle amen he acted like a chicken for a while but he could not be satisfied eating pig food and when he heard that call of Great Eagle come amen once a true son has heard the Cry of the Spirit by the word he too will realize who he is and run to meet the great prophet eagle and be with him forever seated in every places in Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh bless the name of Jesus Oh Hallelujah and the boy starts on a seven stage Journey back to Father's house he's building faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness godliness brotherly kindness and who does he meet when he comes to father's house on the seventh stage of their Journey he sees the Lord [Applause] himself the Lord himself is there to meet him at the top of that pyramid and he Embraces him and he kisses him he takes his ring and he puts it upon his finger and he puts a special robe around the boy remember the law he had to take him into a public place the father is in a public place and he puts a special robe around him adoption time and not only that he has an adoption ceremony kill the fatted calf for my son who was dead has now returned amen there's a whole celebration in heaven any time a son and a daughter of God comes back to Father's House the Bible says the angels in heaven Rejoice amen amen amen hallelujah amen how many of you know that the father adopt to Jesus the same way amen God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son but the adoption didn't take place at his birth the adoption didn't take place on the Jordan River that day even even though the Holy Ghost came and descended like a dove but the father took him up one day amen after he was TR trained after he went through his testings after he went through his trials after he went through his Temptations and the church will go through its own training ground you are on the training ground right now but you must overcome all your trials all your testings amen we find amen what happened amen father took him up on the mountain of transfiguration God adopted his own son like that Jesus walking as an ordinary man but one day on Mount Transfiguration there were three Witnesses Peter James and John amen and watch the prophet says he separated Jesus from them and he overshadowed him and the Bible says is ramond shine like the sun now the prophet says what was it that special robe God adopting his own son amen what happened Jesus had changed his body he had passed over into glorification do you know the Apostle Paul refers to this as robes as a garment he lays down and he longs to be clothed with a garment from above so God takes Jesus on the mountain and he brings him to glorification in an adoption ceremony oh listen to this now and when he adopts Jesus Moses and Elijah appear you'll get it now Hallelujah after the book The titled deed of our inheritance comes down in re ration chapter 10 and after John is's told to take the book and eat the book and after he's told to prophesy again and that is what is going on right now the wife is prophesying again but she must go off the scene she must be changed because the message is the shout to gather the living Saints Hallelujah and when she changed the scene changes because there's a hidden Mystery right there after the prophecy the Rapture must take place and then Revelation 11 Moses and Elijah appears again hallelujah what was it if the head was adopted and Moses and Elijah appeared when the body is adopted Moses and Elijah will appear to the Jews amen amen amen oh hallelujah amen hallelujah so it's adoption time it's no longer time just to remain Sons you've been wandering around in the message in the word just as Sons telling everybody I'm Sons I'm Sons I'm Sons but you're walking around with no Authority when you speak nothing trembles when we speak we expect amen maybe you're you're a Terrorizer at home and you're terrorizing the family and you bring condemnation and fear to everybody but I'm talking about spiritual things walking around just as a son but we need to come to adoption one with authority one with power amen now we're talking about the inheritance because that's what it was about once you adopted you are now an inheritor and that's what Revelation 10 is all about the book of redemption yes sir the title D to our inheritance being brought back to man and the prophet teaches us that the book of Ephesians parallels Joshua and just like Joshua positionally placed them in the land of the inheritance the book of Ephesians places Us positionally in the land of our inheritance which is the Holy Ghost and being in the land of our inheritance is one thing but walking victorious in the land possessing the gates of the enemy with all things under our feet is another thing amen the fful ministry is laboring to positionally place the people in the land of the inhabitants and I want you to know we are not afraid of the Giants in the land this bride Is Not Afraid amen we are not afraid to explore the land amen and take back everything that the devil has stolen from us we are possessing every inch of ground amen hallelujah we're exploring the land from Genesis all the way to re ation we are saying we will take all the land we do not cherry pick from the book amen but we are possessing all the land amen hallelujah amen from natural to Supernatural in fact we even go to Genesis 1 and go into the back Paths of God's mind before God was God Amen and we uncover God's three-fold Plan of Redemption and God is working to bring to pass his plan we are not terrified by the Giants we are not scared of Liv and living in fear and condemnation remember when they got into the land the land was already occupied but they were placed positionally but they had to fight for every inch of ground amen why amen we are waging a war against the Giants how many if you want to wage a war this morning amen hallelujah amen whose report will you believe when we say we are more than able this [Applause] morning amen hallelujah we are waging a war in the Land of the Giants but we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare and not carnal but the mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds we are casting down imaginations imaginations that this person doesn't like me and that person doesn't like me or the pastor didn't greet me and the Deacon said this backbiting and fussing we are casting down every vain imagination amen we are putting our shoulders to the wheel and supporting the ministry casting down every ey thing that exalted itself above the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ not oh if this doesn't work I'll try that if the prayer in the church don't work I'll go to the temple if that doesn't work I'll go to the palm reader if that doesn't work I'll go and call up my ancestors yes you'll be surprised why people are not positionally placed you want God to answer in your time but God will answer in his time it must be God's time any season the children of Israel wanted Moses to answer before time and he slew an Egyptian even though he was called even though it was the will of God for him to deliver them but it was the wrong season the wrong time God must take him back into the back parts of the desert 40 years of training but once he meets that Pillar of Fire now is the time for the Deliverance of the children of Israel anytime you meet that Pillar of Fire that's your season amen hallelujah what makes us unafraid of the Giants in the land the Lord had opened up our eyes like Elisha said open up the boy's eyes and when we opened up our eyes we saw reinforcements coming from another world From Another Dimension because the battle on the Earth was getting hot and heavy amen the battle that started in heaven was now upon the Earth and it was a battle for the mind Revelation 9 talks about the star that fell from heaven what is this demon powers coming down to the Earth and he was given a key to the bottomless pit amen Revelation 9:14 talks about the Four Angels which were Bound in the river Euphrates and now they were let loose and they were prepared for an hour a day month and a year to slay the third part of men itler melini Stalin amen amen and also 200 million demons 200 million Horsemen are let loose and these are Supernatural demons that were let loose upon the Earth this is the Warfare we are in you're thinking it's just the carnal and things you're fighting this person and fighting that person not realizing that it Spirits sent to torment [Applause] you amen amen look at all of these demon powers even under the fourth seal there's a pale of Rider his name is death and the Bible says Hell Followed [Applause] him and power was given over them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword with Hunger with death and with the Beast of the field but when all hell turns loose all Heaven turns loose Loose as well Hallelujah I don't think you heard me when all hell is turning loose be under expectation that all Heaven is going to stand behind you to back you up God is not going to be defeated because when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard amen and we see in Revelation 10 another Mighty angel coming down only Christ it could be amen and he's clothed with a cloud that's not a water Cloud that's not a rocket Cloud but that's a cloud that's formed by seven angels the Angels himself was the wig I know you don't want to Rejoice over that because the devil has put scare crolls around that but that's nothing but the truth amen is clothed with a cloud rainbow Covenant a Grace Covenant amen coming with shoutings of double Grace Grace Grace his face as the sun feet as pillars of fire he has in his little hand a book open and his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth why because out of the sea is coming a beast and out of the earth is coming a beast in Revelation 13 and he must keep his foot on the land and on the sea to suppress these Powers because he still got a people on the Earth God is suppressing the powers that Mighty Angel is here suppressing the powers of the two beasts touch not the oil and the wine amen amen amen hallelujah rising up one rising up amen having seven EDS 10 arms amen upon his head 10 crowns and upon his head the names of blasphemy we know that is people Rome and there's another Beast coming out of the earth two horns like a lamb and he spake like a dragon we know that types the USA in Prophecy amen and not only do we have the Angel standing with one foot on land and one foot on the sea amen but we also have four angels in the Book of Revelation 7 holding back the winds that's Wars and strife you see we don't see these things that are taking place in the Supernatural realm because Putin could have blasted them with that atomic bomb but hold back the winds people don't even know why things transpire on the earth people are wondering why the war in Ukraine what relevance does that have God is still driving the Jews back to the Homeland Ukraine has the highest amount of Jews or had the highest amount of Jews outside of Israel but God put Wars and strife in the land to drive the Jews back to the Homeland because it's time for Moses and Elijah to appear the Jew must be back in the Homeland you don't believe me go and check it out they had the Ukrainian Jews living there but this war forced them back to the Homeland I tell you it's time for us to get out of here amen hallelujah amen Four Angels holding the Four Winds of the earth that they should not blow on the earth nor the sea amen nor on any tree and there's also another Angel who has the Seal of the Living God and what is he doing amen crying with a loud voice to the Four Angels saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads but before their sealing time comes you must be seal first Hallelujah before the Jews are sealed and now the Gentile dispensation is just about ending you must make sure you are sealed with that Holy Ghost Of Promise people are wandering around the train line but there's a flashing red light of his coming but they're wandering around with peanuts amen they are not heeding the call of the on of the train saying the train is almost on the Block I want you to know that on this train the train is not empty the train that is coming are filled with all seven Church age Messengers and their group they have already boarded the train and when that train stops at your track one of these mornings you shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and you must get on board that train but you first must have the to Bren to get on board you must be placed in the land of your inheritance amen hallelujah the Bible says amen we're just about done now give me five minutes and we'll be done amen oh the promise was given amen I will send the promise of my father upon you but ter in the city of Jerusalem until you are endured with power from on high not powers of the earth not an Earthly power not an Earthly inheritance but a Heavenly blessing spiritual blessings amen the anointing is not endered down to us via a natural inheritance but we when we reive the holy ghost we were endured with power from an eye the power Came From Another Dimension it came from another world that what we know the world calls it unidentified flying objects but we have identified these flying objects these are investigating Angels amen amen amen in the 50s there was a space race amen people were wanting to see if there was life on another planet life on the moon but God pulled a fast one on them while the prophet was still on the stage amen while there was space exploration going on a supernatural light appears over the head of the Prophet amen hallelujah oh they tried to test it but the supernatural amen the mechanical eye of the camera will not take psychology the light struck the lens he was proving what the prophet was telling them time and time again the angel of the Lord is not even two feet from where I'm standing he was telling them about this ball of light amen that came into the cave and out of this light came forth a man a 200 lb man amen all of complexion and he said fear not for I come from the presence of God to tell you about your strange and misunderstood life if you're life has been strange if your life has been misunderstood that same Angel is here this morning to tell you about your strange and misunderstood life he's here to tell you you are not from the Earth but you are from above amen and these things are not strange to us this is not a phenomenon we have identified these flying objects when we were born again we came to understand understand that our existence on the earth amen is tied to the Heavenly our birth is tied to a star we are not troubled and Amazed by visitation of angels and seraphim and cherubims and Archangels these things are not uncommon to us but we come from a rich Heritage of men who receive communication and Revelation from a supernatural world we can take you all the way from Abraham to brandham and show you Angelic visitation after Angelic visitation amen and if there has been a disconnection from that Supernatural world it is because of our own unbelief amen it's because of worldly living has got into the church because the power of God Amen he's here this morning Hallelujah to break every chain Hallelujah to break tear down every unbelief and to anoint us to Quicken us this morning amen hallelujah amen because all that was in God he had poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he had poured into his church oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the Holy Ghost Church is endured with power not not a backsliding church not a church hiding behind what God did 50 years ago oh some of you didn't like that we are not hiding behind what God did 50 years ago but this is a church that's endured with power with same signs same manifestations amen same outpouring of the spirit amen we are coming to a time where some backslid people believe that the days of Miracles are passed but we want to say this morning that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday but tomorrow holds but I know who's waiting for me in tomorrow I know who will meet me in the morning amen amen amen we have our own experiences of the sick being healed the dead being raised the blind eyes restored the deaf here and a brokenhearted mended this bride has her own experiences Amen in fact we are just like the church back in Ephesians amen the prophet saw it he said when he saw the preview of the Bride the church that came out in the end time was dressed just like that first church oh hallelujah
