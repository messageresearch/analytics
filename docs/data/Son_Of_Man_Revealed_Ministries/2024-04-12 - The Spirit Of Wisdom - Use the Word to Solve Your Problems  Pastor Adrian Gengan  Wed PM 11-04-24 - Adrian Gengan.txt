========================================

amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen good to see every one of you good to see brother Sun back in church amen hallelujah sister Victory wasn't well she fell amen and she was in a bit of pain that we're taking her to the doctor amen so we'll remember her in prayer how many if you like Wednesday night prayer meetings amen amen praise the Lord Brother jaffer's not here he's got the flu amen hallelujah and his mom's Hospital brother okay sister s was admitted to hospital amen hallelujah sugar levels are high amen so we'll pray that the Lord will amen touch them amen hallelujah amen let's turn to our Bibles Ephesians chapter 1 we'll read from verse 17 161 17 somewhere around there amen praise the Lord okay let's read from verse 15 it says wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him amen the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints amen you may be seated praise the Lord amen so the spirit of wisdom has come in this time amen amen the spirit of wisdom has come amen amen it's come to help us in the place of our trying amen the bride is fixing to go through a greatest trial a greatest test amen praise the Lord you remember the prophet is teaching us the word is in the bride if you type the code up you can find it amen it says as it was in Mary the word is in the bride amen amen now a lot of message people walking the face of the Earth we don't dispute them that the word is in them but what we need to look for is the word quickened in them amen the word must become quickened amen that is what we are talking about the Dynamics coming upon the word which is the holy spirit here to Quicken the word in us now when we are going through trials and testings and the enemy is surrounding us we have a choice to handle it with the five senses we can either go carnal amen or we can choose to handle it with the word of God Amen and when the word of God is Quicken to us that is wisdom Amen to apply the word of God Amen wisdom to apply the word of God Amen so you can now use the word to overcome our problems our trials and our situations amen so the word becomes aive to us amen hallelujah we don't just rejoice in the revelations of it but we are using the word in our daily lives to overcome amen now most Christians have not come to that place yet because they don't know what to do with the word no application of the word St this St come Panic fear anxiety worry depression amen don't know how to use the word but the the the prophecy over us is the Bride As the mind of Christ she knows what to do with the word amen amen she knows how to apply the word yes amen so the moment we find ourselves in anxiety in tension in stress amen getting depressed that is US showing that we are not spiritually mature yet we may have the word in us but we don't know how to use the word amen so we can use the word to over overcome our situations amen word inside people amen but when they face situations they don't know how to use the word when they face Temptation they fall because there is no present tense reality the word is not alive Amen to tell them what to do they got no guide they got no teacher they got no Spirit of Truth amen hallelujah so having the word is one thing but you need the guide you need the teacher you need the spirit of Truth amen to come and Quicken that word to show you what to do with the word amen now the word can be in you but you need the intelligence amen hallelujah we know the holy spirit is the intelligence come to Quicken that word amen so we find out when we speaking on Sunday on changing positions and we find Jesus was walking on the earth for 30 years and everybody knew him as a son of Joseph son of Joseph son of Mary but God was going to change his position when he came to the Jordan River that day amen God changed his position he God changed his title because the voice that came out of Heaven said this is my beloved Son amen changing his position from Earthly Joseph that's who they thought his father was but he came to give him his identity amen amen he changed Jesus position to a Heavenly Place position to let him know he's not the son of the earth amen amen he's the son of God so remember the Bible says immediately after the baptism the spirit led him into the Wilderness for a place of trying for a place of testing yes amen amen he needs he needs to be tried because when you have the word in you you are going to go to a test oh yes yes amen God will try your faith to see if you're a mature son if you're a born son if you're a trained son or will you just Buckle under the pressure so Jesus was tempted went into the Wilderness but the Holy Spirit was there the Bible says that the Holy Spirit led him into the Wilderness amen now you may be thinking the Holy Spirit was not with him the Bible says the fullness of the God dwells in Jesus bodily amen so father Son and Holy Spirit was locked up in Jesus amen so he was being led by the guide he was being led by the spirit of truth and the spirit of Truth told him what to do with the word so every time Satan counted him and Satan went to the word but remember the Temptation was not for him to turn Stone into bread that's what it seems like but what Satan was really attacking is a revelation of what he heard at the Jordan that you are the Son of God Amen oh yes he was there to test him to see if this was truly the Son of God Wonder amen because if you were really an adopted son if you're really the Adam man on the earth Turning Stone into bread is nothing he was there to make him doubt that he was the son of God yes he was there to make him doubt his position and that's what Satan will come to make you do doubt your position thank you Lord thank you Jesus so Jesus goes to the word to reestablish his position you shall not tempt the Lord your God Amen Hallelujah so you can find that example of testing in Matthew chapter 4 amen now just to dwell on the scripture for a short time Ephesians 1:1 17 the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you gold silver this is what Paul is praying for the Ephesians now I pray that the Lord will bless you abundantly I pray amen that the Lord will bless you in all things in diamonds not forgetting a million Rand but the Apostle is saying I do not stop praying giving thanks for you that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you blessings and good health good jobs best jobs in deran what is he praying for the spirit of wisdom you need wisdom more than anything else amen hallelujah amen because wisdom can go to work for you wisdom is the word applied wisdom is the problem solver so he's asking for the spirit of wisdom who is he asking it for a mature Church a church who's in the land amen yes amen hallelujah praise the Lord so what is wisdom when a person reads the Bible we know that we are getting knowledge but knowledge is not good enough anyone can read the Bible and attain knowledge but the word does not make that knowledge of the word does not make us successful does Knowledge from the Bible give us Victory no knowledge is only showing us the theory part that's where many people die in the schools of denomination in the schools amen Bible Colleges and Schools and seminaries but Hebrews 4:2 let's put it up brother amen Hebrews 4:2 teaches us how to handle the word amen amen praise the Lord amen tonight might be a little practically practical look at the word to show us how to operate the word amen amen amen Hebrews 4 and2 For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them so the gospel is going into all the world but the word preached did not profit them so not everyone hearing the word having the luxury of hearing the word does it profit them why yes why not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so hearing the word is one thing but you've got to mix it with faith amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord you got to Quicken it with faith amen because Faith cometh by the hearing of the word mix it with faith amen one more scripture there James 1 and 22 says James 1 and22 but be doers of the word and not hearers only if you only hear the word what are you doing you are in deception we come to church week after week we say I love to hear the word deceiving ourselves but be doers of the word what is he saying use the word for wisdom and apply it in your life amen hallelujah amen amen so we must be doers of the word not just hearers the word must be put into action and we can only put the word into action when it becomes a revelation to us amen you'll never be excited about anything unless it becomes a revelation to you amen praise the Lord am thank you Jesus so when we use the revealed word now what is wisdom we're answering the question what is wisdom this is wisdom when we use the revealed word with understanding in our trials in our place of testing to solve every problem that is wisdom amen that is spiritual wisdom now throughout the message you'll find the prophet speak against wisdom but he's talking about worldly wisdom is not talking about spiritual wisdom so don't get it mixed up when you're reading the prophet's message and he's talking about wisdom he's talking about people who have no revelation of the word they're quoting according to their teachings he's calling that wisdom amen praise the Lord but the Bible is saying the Apostle Paul is saying I want you to have spiritual wisdom amen praise the Lord so every problem we can deduce from there that every problem in our life requires wisdom the problem the the solving the thing the solution for every problem is wisdom amen let's read First Kings chapter 3 First Kings chapter 3 praise the Lord amen First Kings 3:5 yeah the Lord sets up Solomon as king and the Lord the Lord meets Solomon here you'll find in gibian the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night and God said ask what I shall give thee how many if you want God to ask you what do you want right now if we could ask you what do you want amen don't go carnal now learn from Solomon wisest man watch what he asked for and Solomon said thou has showed unto thy servant David my father great Mercy according as he had walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou has kept for him this great kindness that thou has given him a son to sit upon his throne as it is this day and now oh Lord my God thou has made thy servant King instead of David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go out or come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people so he's asking the Lord for wisdom here right that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people and the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing amen amen so when you're praying for a job pray for wisdom amen you're praying for anything in life pray for wisdom amen and God said unto him because thou was asked this thing and has not asked for thyself long life neither has asked for riches for thyself so don't keep going Lord bless me bless me bless me nor as I ask the life of thine enemies but has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment amen here's the blessing Now Behold I have done according to thy words yes lo I given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall arise any shall arise shall any arise like unto thee but I have also given thee that which thou Hast not asked both riches and honor so that they shall not be any among the Kings like unto thee all thy days amen so what must we ask for wisdom amen praise the Lord if we are seeking a job if we have wisdom wisdom will give us a solution if we lack finances wisdom will provide the answer for it if we have uh sick in body wisdom of the word will teach us how to apply the word by faith amen the prophet says if you have need of healing think on those scriptures that pertain to Healing Hallelujah if you have need of any a thing he says think on scriptures that pertain to that so use the word as wisdom people think oh the word is boring the word is nuggets the word is a solution amen hallelujah amen so in James 1 and3 now James 1 and3 amen let's read that James chap 1:3 amen am I pray this is okay tonight amen hallelujah prise the Lord amen I know the devil is probably running to get plasts and band-aid and hallelujah amen because now we are training some soldiers here yes amen and you know he's going to get a hiding praise the Lord verse two my brothers counted all joy what is joy joy is knowing the end result amen Joy is knowing the end result that's why you en Joy you can't be joyful if you're in worry and doubt and wondering what's going to be the end result Joy is knowing the end result amen for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross am oh yes amen if you are going through a trial in a situation and you can't see the end result you're not going to be joyful yes you're going to be in worry but faith will make you see the expected End Amen how it's going to end up and you will be joyful knowing that that's how you that's the place you're going to reach amen so he's saying my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience here it is now amen here it is Faith covered by the hearing of the word but now when you receive that Faith God's going to try that faith in order to add a virtue yes yes amen that the trying of your faith worketh patience Hallelujah am how are you going to get patience the trying of your faith amen praise the Lord but let patience now patience remember Faith must be tried When Faith is tried it worketh patience but if you you got to remain in patience because patience has a work to do yes if we if we step into impatience Faith can't do that work the final work thank you brother amen God has a plan and a program but all of these things are hidden mysteries is that Satan can't understand how you are being built up into the image of Christ yes you see why he wants to take away the revelation of your word so that you don't have faith because Faith now when it's tried brings forth patience but let patience have a perfect work be patient in your problem be patient in your trial thank you endure because patience will lead you to what oh thank you Lord that you may be perfect amen thank you Lord patience is going to make me perfect amen patience is going to lead me to spiritual maturity thank you and entire wanting nothing I'm not going to be in lack what does wanting nothing mean I'm not going to be in lack if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God you see where he's going back to you need wisdom but if you lack wisdom no problem let him ask of God hallelujah amen amen how many you want to ask God for wisdom amen Lord give me wisdom how to handle my trial my situation my circumstance oh God my my path in life what I have to do in this life what you've called me for Lord reveal your mind to me give me wisdom am thank you Lord if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that give it to all men liberally and iaid it not and it shall be given him so if you ask now by faith it shall be given you maybe you walked into the service unwise but if you ask now you walk out of the service a wise person amen full of spiritual wisdom amen thank you Lord thank you Lord but let him ask in faith nothing wavering don't waver now when you're asking for he that waver is like a wave of the sea driven with wind and toss for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways amen so every person must be tested every Son of God must be tested you must go to your place of trying amen when God had taken Abraham amen and called him out and he had to take him to his place of trying the very promise that he told him you'll have a son that was his place of trying because the son son that he waited for for 25 years oh yes after many years now you must sacrifice that son place of trying what if you've been praying for this job for this something in your life and then God tells you sacrifice that thing what are you going to do your dream job your dream car your dream house your dream whatever and God says sacrifice that thing can you trust God enough to say you know the plan for me Jeremiah 29 you know the plan for me so if you say sacrifices I sacrifice it amen nothing wavering praise the Lord amen so you must be tried you will go through trials you now when you're going to trials it's not you don't take it as a personal attack on you it is not you that God is trying it is your faith that God is trying because without faith it is impossible to please God so God is looking for a man of Faith any man that cometh to God must first believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so God is looking for that faith in you he's got to try that Faith amen amen praise the Lord so the person is not being tested but the the faith of the person who's being tested hallelujah amen you know that amen the word of God is true that's what our lord Jesus said so when you keep on hearing the word faith comes by the hearing hearing by the word of God Amen and now that faith has got to be tested the faith that came from you hearing the word of God must be tested amen yes so what happens if there's a message on the earth sent to a particular people and it it's a word that's going to produce No Ordinary Faith but a perfect faith and a rapturing faith amen do you think that Faith must be tested search up cut and slice let's see if we can find something then in in the message search amen uh I know it's on page three or 4 in the church age book amen but I don't know what paragraph it is on your computer search it if there's a revelation sent to the Earth like no other I'm talking about the word coming back down title deed given back to you Revelation seven Thunders these seven Thunders are the divinely revealed mystery truths that are contained in the seals and if that word is going to produce a perfect faith for the Rapture if that word is going to produce amen rapturing Faith perfected Faith amen it must be tried yes amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord than Lord amen if you find it we'll go back to it amen praise the Lord or you can maybe tap up andle the word that little group that can handle the word that's what I want to get to you know he talks about the little group that can handle the word why is he using those words hallelujah amen cut and slice sounds like you're playing with toys or does it sound like you're in your place of trial cut and slice sounds like you're playing with toys or does it sound like you're on the battlefield amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah so what is he saying you will go through a test but that faith will be tried but then you'll have a perfect Faith Hallelujah Satan don't know what to do with you Satan is powerless before you amen hallelujah so when you're studying the word of God how many if you study the word of God by the way amen amen praise the Lord you see none of this will apply now if we not studying the word of God in order to draw from this what I'm telling you tonight we must be be faithful stewards of the word we must be students of the word so when we are studying the word of God the word is growing in you amen and the enemy will come to test you test that Faith tempt you make you doubt what you are studying yes make you doubt what we've been preaching about but your time and season amen what God has called you to this hour and you know what it's your brothers and sisters in the message that will tell you ah not Gods on the earth what are you talking about I ask a question back to them where were you when the sons of God Hall shut for Joy amen hallelujah praise the Lord because I was there amen amen praise the Lord amen so in the same way when you're studying the word now the enemy is going to come to you and he's going to try and put doubt in reasoning you mean to say that you're going to be able to operate like this you mean to say you're a Son of God you're going to be an adopted son amen with the ability to speak a man who can operate Mark 11:23 a man when he speaks he don't doubt his own word but he believes that word that is coming out of his mouth amen hallelujah he shall receive what he have asked for amen you mean there's coming of people on the earth now who can speak amen yes hallelujah amen amen you mean there's a people like that he's going to come and make you doubt that word what is this the prophet is saying the word is in the bride you got nothing in you when I look in you I look and I see Netflix in you I look and I see only movies in you I look and I see only gaming in you what are you talking about the word is in the bride are you going to sit back and doubt that word or the enem is going to say look what's happening to you like the came to job look at the place you are in your place of trying amen look at the place of trying that you are in now you mean to say God LED you to this place what is happening with you job in your place of trial hallelujah amen praise the Lord let's go to it brother amen I found it in two seconds I'll help you fourth seal paragraph 180 amen praise the Lord it says we find out that he gets killed with the sword two the sword of the word God's word sharp to its sword slays him pulls him right down now wait till them seven Thunders utter their voices remembering the uttering of the seven Thunders is coming to give you the revelation of the word and Faith cometh by the hearing of the word I'm driving this point again this faith that is coming is a perfected Faith amen when you claim to hear the seven Thunders understand the revelations contained in the seals it must produce in you a perfect Faith Can somebody say Amen Lord hter their voice to that group who really can take the word of God and hand it there it'll cut it will slice and cut and they can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to do Glory can you say Glory he'll be slayed by the word of God that proceeds from his mouth amen hallelujah he's telling you the same word of God that Jesus is going to slay the enemy finally he the same word of God that's in you and it came by the seven Thunders uttering their voices to you but Satan wants to keep that Revelation away from you by telling you the seven Thunders is not revealed place of trying amen but cut in slice sounds like Child's Play cut in slice shut the heavens oh thank sounds like you're in a playground or does it sound like you in Warfare it sounds like you in the greatest battle ever fought amen Satan coming to the mind you can't find Satan in your mind Hallelujah therefore you've got to put on the mind of Christ the mind of Christ comes in like a fce field over you to guard your mind amen hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus amen thank you Lord thank you so what is he coming to do distort that Faith make you doubt contaminate your faith you can't mix the word with faith now now you got a contaminated Faith now what's that word brother Ramesh that's in broken system wiggle tals contaminated amen amen you like to hear the word of God but you also like this other thing Hallelujah some of us amen hallelujah I don't know if I should say this or not but maybe I should say it amen praise the Lord amallah some of us are like David you got one wife but you got 500 concubines you say not possible you're full of pornography those are your concubines Jesus said if you look at upon a woman to last after her amen hallelujah can I get the brother say a strong amen hallelujah some people feel like David amen hallelujah one wife but lots of conc divins let's kill that devil amen amen praise the Lord be assured the testing of your faith amen produces patience leading you to spiritual maturity and inner peace so starting the word of God remember when you study the word of God you're going to get Faith and your faith must go through testing let's turn to Hebrew 12:6 amen hallelujah praise the Lord everybody still good amen we still got some Davids here amen don't worry I'm going to give you a better context of David now because I don't want you to think of David in that way every time I ask you are you like David you're going to say no I want you to be like David amen slay that giant slay that enemy praise the Lord praise the Lord turn to your brother say praise the Lord or your sister whoever you sitting next to you say praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord amen now don't be upset and depressed there Satan is going to come for you amen he's going to try and work through you yes yeah it is now proving the point that every son now will be tested praise the Lord Hebrews chap 12 we reading from verse 6 amen it says here okay Devil's playing with my app here for whom the Lord loved he chastener and scouch with every son whom he receive now when his sons coming to full adoption in Luther's time in Wesley's time zza Street out pouring now so will there be another chastening amen praise the Lord if you endure chastening God dealth with you has with sons for what son is he whom the father chaste not for if he be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are you bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits amen and live amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah remember the test is not to make you fall Satan's temptation is to make you fall from the faith but God's test is to prove you as a son amen amen when you're going for a driver's license they first put you through the theory part and give you amen what is it called a Learners certificate amen that you know the theory but they must put you on the road they must must test you on the road the test on the road is not to fail you the test on the road is to make sure you you can drive on the road because if they hand you a license without testing you to see if you can drive on the road you can kill people so the test is to check that you have reached that level where you can drive and when you pass that test they give you a driver's license hallelujah amen amen so there's going to be a test to see if you are foot enough to be a son of a king oh you've been preaching about sunship and Authority there will be a test to prove whether you are in such of authority there will be a test where you're required to speak the word oh come on Sons and Daughters of God there will be a test put to you Amen to show your full potential what the effects of the open book has had in my life that I can now speak the word amen amen yes you are in your place of trying right now yes that's right what will you do Buckle under the pressure hallelujah look for mommy amen or are you going to stand up as a son and daughter of God and face your trial amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen now anybody now Faith work at patience right Faith worth patience anybody who has lost their patience loses the battle the moment you lose patience you lost the battle yes because what does patience do bring you to your perfect work bring you to spiritual maturity amen so anybody here loses patience none of us praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord anybody so I know mother's lose their patience quite easily with the children children have the tendency to work on the mother's nerves praise the Lord I know all your mothers have angelic children here but you're going to learn praise the Lord when I ask a question it's not to condemn you so if anybody has lost their patience in life I want to see your hands because we're talking about this amen hallelujah very patient brother here amen they don't even lose patience here praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord so you've lost your patience so when the test and the trial was going on in your life and you lost your patience what happened instead of your thoughts being on the word of God your focus was taken away to focus on the problem and you didn't look to the source of all wisdom you didn't go to the spirit of wisdom and you focus on the situation you focus on your child you focus on that person and you lost patience so patience couldn't do their perfect work amen so instead of you coming Victorious out of that situation you came out frustrated out of that situation you came out defeated after that situation and many times you had to put your tail between your legs and go back and apologize for that situation where you lost your patience amen hallelujah now you have to go eat Humble Pie I'm sorry brother I didn't mean to do this but if you remained in patience don't be quick to answer a fool the Bible says don't answer a fool according to his folly the Bible says hallelujah so instead of your mind being fixed on the word of God what are you looking at what this person is doing to you what this thing is doing to you what this person is saying to you what this one is doing and what that one is doing you spend your entire life in Warfare engaged in fleshly battles and Satan is sitting back and laughing because you're losing your patience with everyone am praise the Lord so what happens in impatience you speak the wrong words now you are Sons and Daughters of God and your words carry power when you are in impatience you speak the wrong words even things you didn't want to confess with your mouth you start confessing you tell the child things you shouldn't say you speak over them and you say things you tell that friend of yours or that colleague of yours you utter words or maybe even a stranger that that's aen come up against you and your anger and you're not in patience you're not in control and you speak words amen hallelujah so what is that fear you're not working in faith you're working in fear you are so fearful amen that you feel you need to control now and the Lord is telling you shut your mouth and you say no Lord I want to show them I want to give them a piece of my mind and the Lord is saying stay still stay still but [Music] no Bush knife Bobby is back amen you're not in patience Hallelujah so people lose battles when they lose patience if you've lost battles in your life it's because you didn't remain in patience Hallelujah people who win battles are those who have overcome impatience people who win battles are those who remain imp patience am so give you a very simple example somebody learning to play the keyboard what does it require lot of practice and a lot of patience amen you went out you bought yourself a organ and you got yourself something classes maybe you bought a guitar and the teacher told you play the string now and you're playing tingting tingting amen but you've got to remain in patience because it's a process I don't if you picked up the guitar and you were skillful the first day amen praise the Lord so you're playing till your fingers bleed all day you're practicing this one thing but if you continue in the faith if you continue in patience amen if you do not quit amen you and you start to grow in patience and you diligently keep practicing and you remain in patience and you keep practicing and you keep practicing you will reach your end goal and you will learn how to play the guitar or you'll learn how to play the keyboard people who are have stopped learning to play an instrument or pursue anything in their lives are people who have gone into impatience if you took up something and you quit have away is because you remained in impatience praise the Lord I hope you can see the deeper thing here if you don't attain perfect faith is because you were in impatience what I'm trying to tell you amen praise the Lord I know all of you want me to quit now hey you saying maybe this brother is going to go deeper now and ask me other questions amen praise the Lord amen now let's not be people who want me to close because you're not [Laughter] patient remain imp patience praise the Lord amen I pray this is helping somebody tonight am amen praise the Lord amen American runner must remain in patience I don't know why they want to run from Peter mburg to Duran but they must remain in patience Hallelujah if they want to go that is why Paul says keep your eye on the prize and didn't he say the race is not to the Swift in the I think it's in Proverbs the race is not to the Swift right so you got to endure amen you press on to the mark of the eye calling praise the Lord so patience is going to lead you to spiritual maturity amen hallelujah so how many times when you are believing the Lord and you're believing in the promise and the Lord said don't open your mouth you still want to open your mouth the Lord says give me praise and thanksgiving in the situation but then you In Fear And you speak doubt and negativity the Lord says remain in praise and thanksgiving but and remain Amen in using your mouth to bless my name hold your peace but you screamed out in anxiety and worry and fear and now did that turn worry fear and anxiety turned into Victory no amen so testing of Faith produces patience spiritual muscles called patience spiritual muscle called endurance that brings you to spiritual maturity how do you know if somebody is spiritually mature how do you know is somebody spiritually mature yes absolutely absolutely say it louder brother rames amen so we are going to perform a spiritual majority test tonight everybody take off your shoes brother brandom says if you want to see if a person is dead just kick him a little bit his toes rub him the other way praise the Lord the joy of the Lord is my strength somebody say the joy of the Lord Joy of is my strength is my strength because your countenance now is changing amen because I'm dealing with Spirits now amen and I don't get afraid of your angry face amen because I can recognize Spirits hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord so now amen what we talking about how do we know a spiritually mature Christian how much pressure he can take how much force he can take amen hallelujah how much of opposition he can take in his place of trial how much of tension pressure opposition can he take and can he be in patience during this time can he remain in peace at this time amen hallelujah how much of insult he can take in this time of unjust treatment amen and we look to the champion of all Champions Jesus they slapped him he opened not his mouth mouth they spat on him they opened up his not his mouth they put up crowns on his head he

in patience for the victory for the joy that was set before him amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen tell your brother I'm so patient tonight patient oh patient amen praise the Lord you see even escom is having great into meltdowns here amen praise the Lord so how much of test under the pressure if he stands and remain Victorious then you know a spiritually mature Christian right Hallelujah you know a mother giving birth to a baby through all the pain she remained in patience if they told her go for 10 injections she went for it because of patience she knew what she was going to bring forth into the world if they told her they going to perform surgery on her she remained in patience because of what was coming forth how many of your mothers know what I'm talking about fathers don't know they were standing outside there talking to their friends some of us had to stand inside amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen I like you to be happy people amen amen praise the Lord be happy Mothers remained impatience because of the joy that was coming forth and you know what you ask a mother after birth will you have a child first maybe couple months she'll tell you never again but he give her a few months maybe a year or two years she'll tell you love let's have another child why the joy of bringing forth another child she remains in patience so we said Temptation the intention of Temptation is to make you fall into a trap amen but a test is that you should not fail but that you should pass the test so that God can promote you to the next level so exams and test trials that we face in this life are for taking us to the next level of glory amen amen amen yes every student goes through test exams and those that get good marks are promoted to the next level amen hallelujah that's what a test is for so we've got to have a Victor's mindset and not a victim mindset somebody say I've got to have a Victor's mindset oh come on some of you need to speak this words I need to have a Victor's mindset and not a victim's mindset I don't now I don't want you to all this but I want you to understand what I'm saying forget about your past where you came from your circumstance and stop having a victim's mindset amen if you want you've got all the reason to have a victim's mindset because the Bible says we were born in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies our first birth was cursed so we can choose to have a victim's mindset and live under the curse or we can come under the Victor's mindset and rise above the curse amen amen amen yes Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen so when you're tested you get patience patience amen should be you should endure in patience patience should have a work in you because when a person stays in patience does not give up he's passing the test amen he will not only meet amen the end result but he will be perfected read that scripture again patience will lead you to Perfection amen we've

not a weak son amen hallelujah so the the one who remains in patience is the one who remains on cause the one who is steady amen amen the one who can endure extreme pressure amen the one who can remain in love that's what I was going to say that a mother because of love she goes through all of that because of love and what does the Bible say there in James you will lack nothing if you have spiritual wisdom you will lack nothing because what are finances if you got wisdom then you'll know how to operate with finances hallelujah amen praise the Lord any area in your life if you got spiritual wisdom why you think Paul talking to the most mature Church he's saying I I think of you day and night I've not ceased to pray for you but when I'm praying for you I'm asking for the Lord to give you the spirit of wisdom did David ask for it did Daniel ask for it we read Daniel chapter 2 there amen so lacking in nothing you're lacking in nothing tell somebody I'm lacking in nothing I can't believe that we will be sitting here tonight to say that we are lacking in the word I can't believe that after the message of the hour has come Revelation 10:7 has come Malachi 4:5 and 6 has sounded amen that we can lack anything the word is our source we are lacking nothing Hallelujah I'm expecting a better amen than that you are lacking nothing am lacking in nothing amen hallelujah

went to the Cross because he was fixed on the father's will and you were the father's will the moment you turn your focus from God you're moving into impatience but you've got to train yourself to focus amen train yourself to focus amen believe on the word of God praise the Lord amen the Bible says if you lack Wisdom ask of the lord your faith is being tested your patience is working P amen
