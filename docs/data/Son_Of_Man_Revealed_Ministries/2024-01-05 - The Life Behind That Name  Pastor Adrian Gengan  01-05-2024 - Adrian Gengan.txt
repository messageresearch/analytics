children amen praise the Lord amen let's turn to our Bibles amen there's only one name I can greet you in that's the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen so happy to be together again tonight amen I pray amen that even as we Minister the word of the Lord amen that revelation will be imparted amen amen hallelujah let's turn to Colossians 3 and verse4 Colossians chap 3 we'll read from verse one if he then be risen with Christ amen amen you see how God sees us amen as risen with Christ now there's a lot of things attached to that I can dwell on that right now but there's a lot of things with being risen with Christ because when he rose he was Victorious he had all things under his feet amen so in that he packed with Revelation right there that you are risen with Christ amen seek those things which are above amen so we can't be living carnal lives where Christ sth on the right hand of God now isn't that the believer's position in Christ in Ephesians amen so he's saying seek those things set your affection on things above because where your treasure is that's where your heart will be so he's saying set your affection on things above not on things on the earth amen for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God amen amen amen when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall he also appear with him in glory who's our life amen Christ is our life amen amen it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and the faith I have is not my own faith but faith of the Son of God is in me now amen hallelujah amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall he also appear with him in glory praise the Lord praise the Lord amen John 141 our lord Jesus now John 14:1 is following John 13 remember it was one continuous conversation they were having from when Jesus was telling Peter he was going to deny him and then he was telling Peter this and then he goes straight into John 14 because they were not troubled with what Jesus was telling them that Peter was going to deny him so their hearts were troubled then Jesus says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me now we are in the season reaching maturity reaching full Harvest I want you to read between the lines when I'm reading the scripture you believe in God believe also in me amen amen the final voice is on the earth yes amen Amen Hallelujah Jesus is not here in the Corporal body but he's here in his bright body you believe in God believe also in me amen hallelujah the Bride is a Ministry of Deliverance the Bride is a Ministry of healing amen but it's got to take a people who will believe that Ministry amen John 66 3 says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh proth nothing but the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen meaning that the words coming out of this bride's body is a mature word amen is a word of maturity amen it's a word where their word is backed up this is not a lam word spoken their word carries Authority so I say unto you that your word cannot return void because it's the voice of Elohim speaking through you amen so 1 of may you know what 1 of May is they call it Mayday amen Mayday is the halfway point between the Spring Equinox and the summer solstice it's marking a specific time in the year the changing of Seasons changing of spiritual Seasons as well amen Hal hallelujah amen for those of you weren't happy we were moving in fourth gear we are moving into fifth gear now amen amen crying Grace Grace unto you amen hallelujah maybe your gears were straining in the fourth amen it's time to move into fifth gear because it's a changing of Seasons what's happening the days are growing longer the weather is warmer amen hallelujah so in this time and season your Revelation must be increasing amen amen when the prophet says that this is a sacred desk I now I have a greater understanding of what it means because no Minister should be behind his desk unless he is called of God Amen would they were to equip people and bring them to rapturing Faith amen amen if that person doesn't have a word to bring them to maturity and full Perfection and to a time of adoption they should not be beyond the pulpit the fold Ministry is a special gift a special anointing amen hallelujah praise the Lord so greater Revelation ought to be coming out amen you should be able to identify the spirit of Truth amen the spirit of wisdom amen you should be able to identify the guide Amen in this time and season it's time the Lord is positioning us amen Hallelujah the day days of saying we're in the message and we're in the message church amen are over amen now we are in the body of Christ the mystical Body of Christ every member fly framed together knowing they're part of the word hallelujah and Christ is not going to take a deformed bride if your name was predestinated and put there before the foundation of the world you are going to come forth at this time amen you have to come to maturity at this time God's not to take what the bride with a missing toe amen with a missing limb amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord amen hallelujah so amen what are we doing we're building up the brother brand says as she kns The Headstone amen hallelujah amen hallelujah we've brought the Holy Ghost here bringing down the Dynamics upon the mechanics amen we thank God that the early church pastors amen labored to sew in the mechanics amen they swed in the mechanics amen now in the season of the Dynamics amen hallelujah quickening power has come to the church quickening power is here amen hallelujah than you Lord amen quicking power come upon our mechanics amen hallelujah praise the Lord and he's positioning us now and we we ought to be thanking the Lord for all of the revelations amen 1963 was no ordinary event 1963 was a most SEC time for the bride amen 1963 amen our names were called amen praise the Lord amen God had positioned his Prophet here on the earth 1963 was the time of life Sarah I'm coming to you according to the time of life 1963 was the time of life and there was a prophetic voice on the earth even though maybe we weren't born yet there was a prophetic voice on the earth that was receiving the revelations of God and the Seven Seals beneath the Seven Seals H the mystery of our birth amen H the mystery of our names praise the Lord so he was here amen and he sounded forth a prophecy declaring that there is a bride coming praise the Lord therefore he couldn't go past the seventh verse because amen from eight onwards those names that were in the book were not manifested on the earth yet so he had to leave it in an Unwritten part and not touch it amen because when those names are revealed amen they will open the book and they will see the names in the book and they will identify their part of the scripture and they will manifest their part of the scripture somebody give God praise if that's you amen oh give God praise give God praise amen hallelujah praise the Lord you know this is identification time amen you know your name is your identification you know amen that behind every name carries a life praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen so the word is coming to position Us in this hour bring us to a place where we've got perfect Faith amen enough Faith to call down amen the holy spirit amen enough place amen this is not amen if you if you are the season of your birth that's fine but I tell you amen you need a supernatural birth and a supernatural acceleration of growth because we are coming to the time of adoption amen this is a season of maturity L amen praise the Lord this is the season of maturity amen the Holy Ghost is here for adoption ceremony praise the Lord amen amen and when the angel comes down with the book he's coming down with a book for a purpose to bring us a word amen the word is in the book amen hallelujah and the book is being brought back to a redeemed people amen hallelujah eternal life fellowship with God power over the [Music] Earth amen how many of you can recognize that we are in a season now a critical season yes that's right we are in no ordinary season amen the mark of the beast amen has already been set up amen one world religion has already been set up amen all of those mechanics amen behind the scenes have already been set up they are waiting for their Dynamics they are waiting for Satan Superman they are waiting amen you know what the Dynamics is amen that was our refilling the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they are waiting for their Dynamics amen for that devil Spirit to come and possess the pope amen they're waiting for the Dynamics to come upon their mechanics hallelujah praise the Lord remember he's a copycat amen praise the Lord so this amen is a season of life this is the time of life amen this is the time for the Book of Life That's we dwelling on The Book of Life on Sunday amen Rejoice that your names are written in heaven amen The Book of Life praise the Lord hallelujah amen therefore we were reading seek those things which are above amen set our affections on things above Christ is our life am amen and you've got to connect with life if this is the time of life and the angel is bringing life to the Earth not ordinary life he's bringing Zoey life he is bringing eternal life then you've got to connect that's why the instruction is go to the angel connect with life amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen in this book amen hallelujah is the mysteries of God and the Mystery makes the plan clear the Plan of Redemption makes it clear amen if you are reading the message and you can't see your name in the book something is wrong you know they were talking about I think believe Paul gives us testimony and uh about this man and he gave somebody a book I think his boss and the next day he went to ask his boss have you read the book and he said yes I read the book and he said well I read this book and this man is's calling me a bazard the man tells his boss it's strange I'm reading the same book and in that book he's calling me an eagle amen you've got to see your name in the book praise the Lord now it's easy it's easy to tell whether your name is in the book or not very easy because Revelation 13 details it and it brings it down amen maybe we can go to some of it amen Revelation chapter 13 praise the Lord for those of you I know we got some younger people here that don't read their Bibles praise the Lord amen we make them read tonight Revelation 13 and8 praise the Lord amen Revelation 13 and8 now this is going to be your identification in this time yes whether your name is written there or not it's going to come down to one thing here's it here and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him Hallelujah whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the earth of the world so where is it coming to the worship how do the Rebellion start in heaven worship how does it end worship didn't Jesus tell the woman at the well John 4 the father is seeking those whose names are in the book Because when the names are in the book amen it declares their freedom declares their Deliverance so the father is seeking those that will worship in spirit and in truth so the only time you can truly Worship in spirit and in truth is if you see your name in the book amen amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen amen I was expecting a greater celebration than that amen hallelujah because you are going to get exposed now amen you say I like quiet worship amen there ought to be a shout in your worship am there ought to be a praise in your worship they ought to be in Hallelujah you know when the 24 Elders were I'm using it this way where I don't want to say the word amen you may get me wrong but they were confined to Heaven 24 Elders around the throne and they knew they can't return back to the Earth no one who departs from this life can return back to the Earth prior to Jesus coming in taking the Book of Life back so the 24 Elders knew they couldn't come back to the Earth amen part of the 24 Elders was the 12 disciples amen yes praise the Lord yes so they know they can't come back to the Earth so they you can see the the time changes there in heaven when John is weeping John is weeping and he's representing all mankind the Bride of Jesus Christ that we want to get back to the Earth amen but we can't but Earth is our domain Earth is our home but we can't get back there when the spirit leaves his body so there's a cry there's a weeping but they identify the the line of the tribe of Judah and they say he is the one who prevails amen he's the king yes the lion is the king I want you to know that the first announcement that was given is that where is he born King who are these people who are studying the first Bible they saw something in the heavens that made him King they didn't come asking where is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world no they were asking where is the king amen amen amen hallelujah they must have seen amen they must have seen the constellation of Leo Hallelujah they must have seen amen and he was connected with that yes Hallelujah and and he came and asked where is he born King of the Jews and the angels made sure they were present at his birth and they presented themselves to a to shepherds in the field and this was no ordinary child yes amen amen God was going to do things a legal way if God had come and redeemed man any other way except through man it would have been an illegal way because the book was lost because man's inheritance was lost by a man it had to be regained by a man yes but God won't do anything that will violate his own word so God must work according to his own law God must work according to his own law Amen to his own word so he's got to inject himself into the human race he's got to create a body for himself amen a perfect lamb amen and I want you to know that Jesus didn't come the way that we came Jesus was a spoken word seed Son of God amen thank you Lord praise the Lord amen amen I'm here and pick up your pen right now he says Adam was a spoken word seed Son of God Amen he was a seed of the word now you know something anything in seed form if you want uh orange I can't give you a seed and tell you yeah eat an orange so you can't remain in seed form Adam was a seed of the word if you type up seed of the word you'll find it there amen he was a seed of the word but through the fall amen all of other mankind came the illegitimate way amen but Jesus didn't come that way amen Jesus came as a spoken word seed amen the angel said You shall conceive and bear a son amen the same thing Adam was supposed to do to Eve was say Eve you shall conceive and bear a son and his name shall be called you want to say Abel or Seth whatever the name was his name shall be called this amen hallelujah am Sarah you shall conceive you shall have a son and his name Shall be Called Isaac amen he God you're going to have a son and his name Shall be Called ishmail amen these are the words words of the Angel this is how he speaks Mary you shall have a son and his name Shall be Called Jesus amen hallelujah so he's coming the legal way he's coming the legal way to take back man's inheritance yes amen hallelujah but Redemption story didn't end at the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ come on denominational people amen hallelujah not you now talking to denominational world Amen praise the Lord they believe it ended at the at the resurrection amen praise the Lord but there's a further work to do beyond the resurrection he's resurrecting for a reason otherwise he would have established his kingdom you know after Jesus resurrected no one could kill him he's in a glorified body they couldn't have killed him if he chose to remain on the Earth he could have remained on the Earth but you know what the problem would have been he alone would have been living Generations would have been dying and he alone would be alive in a body that doesn't age hallelujah amen come on now I'm stretching you thinking you now amen he alone would have been alive but his purpose of coming was to redeem every name that was on the book amen so you must get back to heaven where the book is he's after the book He's after the names in the book so that's why when he resurrects he goes back to Heaven because there's one seated on the throne that's got the book and God the father is not giving God the son the book it's the same one taking the book from [Music] himself it's the flesh God taking the book from Spirit God yes amen amen amen hallelujah there's no when you reading the book when you're reading the Revelation 5 there there's a lamb taking the book there's no lamb there on woles that's going there bleedy bloody lamb taking the book the book is not changing ANS the one holding the book is changing form amen praise the Lord amen so God worked according to his own law and injected his seed into the human race amen hallelujah now amen there's a God man now there's a God man amen on the earth praise the Lord you know this our Lord Jesus amen demon powers recognized him amen demon powers recognize his name yes you know there yes something about your name right right praise the lord we know there's something about your name but your name I want to speak something about your name here now amen praise the Lord your name carries power how many of you know that amen amen your name carries power your name carries an inheritance there's something about a name we sing that song it's the life behind that name amen so your name carries a life if you had no life you'll have no name you don't believe me the moment life leaves the body they call them dead you'll never find anyone referring and ask them what time Michael is coming today when they going to they're asking about the casket when they're asking about the undertakers bringing your body they don't ask what time uh Maru is coming ask what time is the body coming as soon as life leaves the body you become nameless yes yes so behind every name is a [Music] life amen praise the Lord and a life carries an inheritance amen a life carries a certain amount of authority but the life must reach a stage of maturity because brother Bram is telling us that when a son comes to maturity when he comes to adoption then the father takes him to an adoption ceremony and he transfers all of his rights to the son meaning the son now has the same signing Powers the same name as his father amen thank you Lord amen so ask yourself a question when Jesus is saying in my name he's talking about a time when adopted Sons will come to maturity in the season of adoption in the season of maturity amen when they can carry my name in my name means they are in my character they in my likeness the father is well pleased with you amen you have come to the Statue of a perfect man PR the Lord amen hallelujah you know even the demon powers when they looked at Jesus they were able to identify him how many if you know that amen the demon powers were able to identify Jesus I just want to pick it up for you very quickly here amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord sorry the thought just come to me now and I need to find it amen for you quickly amen so Matthew 20 okay let's go to Mark 1 I think Mark 1 is a better one because it's got quite a few there amen let's go to Mark 1 Mark 1:23 says as and there was in the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out so an unclean spirit is a demon power but the power is crying out saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou Jesus of Nazareth are Thou come to destroy us I Know Thee who Thou Art the Holy One Of God Amen demon powers can recognize you amen and Jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him amen and when the unclean Spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice he came out of him and they were all amazed in so much they questioned among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this you see notice there now don't don't move too quickly they had never seen somebody like this that they called him a thing they never seen a man operate like this amen yes they thought him if he was living in today's day they would have thought he was a alien amen so they ask what thing is this is it in your Bible there what thing is this they had never seen a man in this Authority he's walking and demon powers are manifesting and saying I know who you are why they were worshiping him in another form yes when he was Elohim there with the angels amen these same demon powers were worshiping so they recognized his presence and when you carry his presence amen demon powers recognize who you are praise the [Music] Lord hallelujah so if demon powers are not running from you if they like to be around you watch watch your spirit amen praise the Lord yes what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commanded he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him amen Jesus was a man who knew what the word said about him how about you and I we should be people who know what the word says about us we should be able to believe all that the word says about us and when we speak we speak with authority we shouldn't suggest to the devil that he leaves we should speak with authority that he must live amen thank you Lord amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so we're coming to a time in season now amen where the life is on display amen hallelujah a critical season the life is on display so he said the name carries Authority the name carries power amen do you know the name carries a presence Jesus said where two or more are gathered in my name I will be in the midst so the name carries a presence brings down the presence of God hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah there's so much in this in my name Amen in my name amen hallelujah do you know there's rewards in his name in the name of a person that's why brother Brandon would say if somebody comes and give you a cold cup of water he says those who do good to the bride they won't lose their reward amen so names carry rewards am Jesus is saying whosoever receives a little one in my name receiveth me amen he's saying we two or more are gathered together in my name I am there in my their midst amen this is what Jesus is saying I'm showing you the name carries a life and the life carries blessings and different things attached to the name hallelujah hallelujah the name carries rewards inheritance Jesus is telling telling them no one of you have left fathers mothers houses and lands amen for my name's sake you shall receive 100 fold amen Jesus is operating in the Kingdom where he knows he operates in the principle of multiplication amen whatsoever you sacrifice in this life you shall receive it 100 fold take God at his word somebody mark this down Matthew 19 amen sorry yeah Matthew 19 verse 29 somebody write this down Matthew 19 amen hallelujah When You're Going To God In Prayer Lord I have forsaken ladies here I forsaken The Riches of this world I forsaken houses and lands and in your word you said you I shall receive H hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life so the name is attached to eternal life am praise the Lord the name is attached to eternal life yes it is amen you don't believe me amen John go to John 20 amen John chapter 20 oh praise the Lord amen the last verse 31 but these are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ the son of God and that by believing you might have life you might have life through his name what life is that Zoe life that life is eternal life amen by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ believing on his name you can have life through his name amen so all of these blessings are coming because it's in his name praise the Lorden and then there are people who also coming and deceiving in his name you know Matthew 24 that talks about that amen hallelujah amen yes yeah in Mark 9:41 whosoever shall give you a cup of water a drink in my name be because you belong to Christ verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward amen I could go on and on in that amen that's not my point I'm trying to show you that the name there's blessings attached to the name amen there's blessings there's life attached to that name amen it's the life behind the name amen hallelujah it's not based on Works amen praise the Lord amen jumping all over the place here amen I'm trying to find a train of thought here amen praise the Lord amen so you can't be delivered at this time you can't be delivered out of this cage of unclean Birds unless your name is in the book you can't come out and receive Malachi 4's message Revelation 10:7 message unless your name is in the book amen amen this message is not for whosoever will let him come yes this is for a message for whose names are in the book amen hallelujah you don't believe let's put up Daniel 2:21 there again amen Daniel 2:21 he's showing you that is coming to deliver names found in the book He's only coming to deliver names found in the book amen Daniel 2:21 Amen are we in the right scripture here I think it's above this amen where he says uh let's go right up amen we read the scripture on Sunday praise the Lord let me just see if I've got my scripture right here amen praise the Lord everybody feeling good amen amen that's Changing Times and Seasons there amen I was tying that with Mayday Changing Times and Seasons hallelujah amen is your name in the book amen praise the Lord I think it's uh 12 sorry Daniel 12 verse1 and at that time shall Michael stand up that great Prince which standed for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time and at that time shall thy and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book Deliverance is only coming to those whose names are in the book therefore you find people can't Rejoice around what the prophetic message was about at 19963 1963 was a time of life amen eloim appeared with seven angels amen the angel themselves was his wig amenallah praise the Lord amen it's a time of life he's coming to reveal your name in the book so it's a time of Deliverance and like we said it's a time when the those names are found in the book must start to worship Him must start to worship Him in spirit and in truth so meaning your worship can't be ordinary Lord amen we read for you on Sunday amen how the wor seen change in heaven when John saw his name in the book and John saw his theophonic body and this message has come to connect you back to you of the offering so you can't sit silent in the church anymore you can't sit silent in the church when your name is being revealed it's lamb worship time amen it's King worship time amen it's time to give him praise hallelujah amen hallelujah the identification is going to be in the worship Jesus is detailing it too in spirit and in truth the spirit of Truth is here amen hallelujah amen Spirit of Truth is here amen you can't tell me you got the Holy Ghost and you got a quiet Holy Ghost amen hallelujah praise the Lord I'll take you back to the origins and show you how they staggered out there the people thought they were drunk men amen hallelujah amen if we make some of you stand now they'll say what hour of the day is this for these are sleepy men looks like they've been asleep or will they say looks like they've been drunk amen amen but Peter says it's only the third hour of the day these are not drunk as you suppose amen praise the Lord you know there quote the prophet says they when when they received the Holy Ghost they started jumping out the window started jumping because there was not enough room for the doorway 120 staggering out he said some jumped through the windows some made it out through the doors but they were staggering out there under the power of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah how are you staggering out of here amen I hope you're staggering out of your drunk full of new wine amen full of inspiration amen full of Holy Ghost anointing amen hallelujah oh I feel the changing of the Season amen I feel the the changing of the Season amen this is a call to the Rapture this is a call to the resurrection amen this is what the mess the message has come to deliver your name deliver your name from the lateran mess amen oh Hallelujah Leia is a graveyard amen and in them they are lifeless but he has come to deliver your name and he's not only come to deliver your name but in the midst of the graveyard he's got to give you light he's God to give you light brother Joshua therefore Psalm 27 says the Lord is my light in the midst of a graveyard in the midst of Blackness in the midst of dead people zombies Walking in leosia the Lord has come to give you light give God praise amen the Lord is my light the Lord is my salvation amen hallelujah oh praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah amen he must come to give us light amen hallelujah gross Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness over the people amen but amen but to you amen Rise and Shine for thy light has come oh yes and what the scripture doesn't end and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you church this is a time when the glory of the Lord is seen upon you is Manifest in your life amen you are not the same all you thank you Lord praise the Lord thank you praise the Lord thank you Lord amen I am not my own amen I'm bought with a price I'm a Holy Ghost full man I'm a stature of a perfect man amen amen start to speak with confidence amen amen change your confession change everything about you amen thank you Lord thank you Lord if you don't change your own confession how are people going to change their confession about you you've got to believe in yourself amen you believe in the father believe also in me thank you believe in the words coming out of your mouth that's the 11 Mark 11:23 man a man who believes the words coming out of his own mouth we can't be saying with a bride with a bride with a bride and then live any other kind of life amen a powerless life a defeated life amen but we've got to be people who believe our own words because the name of a bride carries things amen have things attached to it oh praise the Lord so amen hallelujah summarizing it out very quickly your name amen carries power your name carries Authority am you have the married name of the Lord Jesus Christ your name represents your Dominion amen remember now when when the name was delivered in heaven and the book was given to the lamb amen he says amen what did they say th was made as kings and priest oh praise the Lord praise the Lord amen and in this time and season now King and priest is very important because the king must have a domain and where they said we shall on the earth not in heaven on the earth yes man's domain is the earth you coming back is King and priest on the earth amen nothing shall be saved except your name is in the book therefore the Rapture is a called for those names who are in the book Thank You amen amen amen you can't be saved if your name is not in the book amen so I know my name is in the book amen and brother Brandon tells us the name in the book is not Alman Neville it's not John Jones he said but it's the mystery of the book and while the Mysteries are being revealed your names are being called out amen amen hallelujah what was it called out amen hallelujah I can say something here now but John was told not to write [Music] it John was told not to write it amen praise the Lord but they come to reveal your names amen hallelujah because that they revealed your name Satan have heard it and you know the prophet says it this way if you got something you want to do he says you rather keep it in your heart Hallelujah because Satan can go and go before your mother plan so he's come to reveal your name in the book amen hallelujah and the proof that you know your name is in the book how many of you to know what the proof is the proof that you know your name is in the book is that you agree to this end time message you can receive the revelation of the word coming out of this time amen it's proof that your name is in the book amen you don't believe me take this Revelation and give it to

separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus and Christ is our life amen how many of you know that ought to bring a setle peace within us that means we can't live in worry and fear because our life is hid in Christ then how we going to get worried about a bull and how we going to get anxiety about these things how about we recognize start to really come into a mature seed Son of God and start to say my father HS a cattle on a thousand hills amen hallelujah my father is Elohim my father is shyra my father is amen we don't call upon God the first thing we want to call upon is maybe friends and the family the first thing we want to call upon is maybe a lone shark but how about we go to Aba cry at ABA father Lord how come you made me a God man given me Dominion Authority power amen even Jesus proved it when they're coming to collect taxes he says go check in that fish mouth Yes amen hallelujah amen amen so the random says that Adam when God created Adam in His image and after his likeness he was a seed of the word amen we find that quote seed of the word in church ages he was a seed of the word that's who Adam was seed of the word So Adam was a seed of the word but MDC took it further amen the first time we read about his spoken word son is Adam the next time we find somebody it's mesic Amen we come to John one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so first we got the seed of the word that's in the image and likeness seed of the word then Genesis 14 we come to MDC who is not the seed of the word but he is the word himself amen is God himself in the theophonic body amen praise the Lorden now we see that malaz is there it's showing you the maturity of the word if Adam had remained in his State before the fall he would have matured to that kingly position oh I pray you get me tonight Adam couldn't have remained a seed of the word only yes his seed would have matured yes and he would have come into his kingly position like MDC amen right you see you got to think deep now when God this is God now saying let us make man in our image and after our likeness yes the same one is now coming in the form of mesic so he would have had to mature to mesic State yes because he was made in the image and likeness of MDC amen yes praise the Lord amen amen so if he had remained in that state he would have become king therefore m was called King of Salem amen king of righteousness no beginning of days no ending of days he's the Eternal King had to be God himself Amen in a theopen body and that's the mature state of the word amen that means if sin had not interrupted the picture the seed of God the seed of the word in Adam was supposed to grow and become mature and become like mesic M because mesic is the mature state of the word coming into perfection that's when the word comes into Perfection can be placed as king and let have dominion so from the seed word you got to grow and become the matured word now yes after the New Birth from your seed word you've got to mature and grow amen and come to Perfection and when that word is placed and when that word comes to perfection in your life you are going to be placed as king amen hallelujah yes thank you Lord when the word comes to perfection in your life you are going to come back as king amen amen amen might be too deep for Wednesday night service amen
