was in charge of worship and he knows that a shot must go off at a certain level a decible must be reached yes to influence the spiritual realm amen amen yes Hallelujah yes that's why when the when the Lord told the children of Israel to March around Jericho they didn't whisper and go around Jericho amen they were excited amen that Jericho walls were coming down amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so amen some of us need to change CH our worship amen some of us need the baptism of the Holy Ghost some of us need a real Touch of fire in our souls how many of you ever touched fire and whispered ouch amen Holy Ghost Fire is here amen amen amen so pull yourself together talk to yourself and say get into the spirit amen John was in the spirit on the Lord's day amen hallelujah amen how long will we continue in these things amen how long amen hallelujah amen so let's ask the Lord to give us Grace this morning even as we go to the word amen praise the Lord hallelujah St John chapter 12 amen so in John chapter 12 we'll read from verse 23 says and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified do you feel the bride is reaching that position amen amen so the bride can say we feel it in our Spirits we feel it in our soul that the hour is come amen amen that his wife must be glorified now amen verily verily I say but there's a process now and here's the process verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit so that's the process we under right now he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto Eternal unto life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor yes amen now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour amen amen the bride has been through birth pains but for this cause for such a time as this have we come to this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven watch son it's going to th now saying I but glorified it and will glorify it again the people thereof that stood by and heard it said that he thundered others said an angel spake to him Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes amen amen amen one more portion of scripture Amen in the book of Corinthians amen praise the Lord Second Corinthians chapter 3 amen we'll read the entire chapter amen for the sake of those that need to read a chapter a day praise the Lord 2 Corinthians chapter 3 Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you you are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as he are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to godwood not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God Amen yes who had also made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life so the five-fold ministry trueful Ministry is one that is preaching amen from the spirit realm but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stone was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious amen for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more do the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory yes for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that sell it for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not of Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their mind Minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away way in the reading of the Old Testament yes which Veil is done away in Christ yes but even to this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart amen yes now we got another Exodus here right I wonder if people reading bram's message have a veil yeah nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen hallelujah but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord thank amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so we've been dealing amen with a few thoughts recently and you know we've been dealing really with revelation 10 the unveiling of the mystery of God amen amen every time we talk about our position and anything associated with us amen it is only because the mystery of God has been revealed so all of this is coming out under Revelation 10:7 can you say amen amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall began to sound the mystery of God should be finished amen had he not sounded the mystery of God would not be fulfilled revealed so which means our true identity would also be hidden yeah but because the mystery of Christ The Mystery of God is revealed our true identity has now comeing to Plain View amen but remember they can't see past the veil so we see amen that we were revealed because of the mystery of God and we see ourselves in him and now when we see ourselves in him behind the Mysteries we see our name written in the book written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen so we started this year talking about the glory of the Lord how many if you remember that amen hallelujah it's not too far away amen not too long ago we were talking about the glory of God and we haven't stopped it has just evolved into another level yes amen hallelujah usually when you talk about Glory people want to see manifestations have we not seen enough manifestations last year under the supernatural outpouring of the Holy Spirit but I'm going to show you a more glorious thing that has been happening right the glory of the Lord and and remember the the theme of it was share in his glory amen but this Revelation has evolved to a place and it's now breaking at an incredible Pace because when you break that sound barrier you just go amen how many if you can feel that amen hallelujah I feel like we are in an Enoch walk amen hallelujah amen amen and this like I said would not be the glory that's seen in Miracle signs and wonders but the glory we are seeing is that Sons and Daughters of God are coming to full maturity oh yes amen amen to watch that power of transformation can only take the glory of God Amen to bring that seed to maturity amen so this morning I want to talk on and this is the title The Shak of Glory over your seed word oh to bring you to manifested Sons spoken word sons of God the Shak Glory over your seed word to bring you to manifested sons of God amen amen hallelujah amen amen you know in the Book of Luke it tells you it is the Father's good pleasure to give to you the kingdom amen yes it's a father's good pleasure to give it to you you know when you give your children something and you really want to give it to them it's your good pleasure to give it to them and Jesus is telling us it's the father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord now we know that just to uh detail this a bit and give you a background that in the Tabernacle in the setting of The Tabernacle we are shown amen the three parts of the Tabernacle amen yes amen typing God's presence amen hallelujah and we know amen that there was the three areas of the Tabernacle we are the outer Court the holy place and then Beyond the Veil is the holiest of holiest how many of you can say Amen to that you know that Amen to be the truth amen so even so in our human bodies we are likened to these three compartments amen hallelujah because we have have Amen in the area of our flesh body that's the outer court amen we have likened these things amen so the inner court amen the holy Place praise the Lord and then we got the holiest of holies so we know the OT being the body then we got the holy Place being the spirit realm and then down in there is a soul which is the holiest of holies amen where the seed Gene of God resides amen and that's what we are targeting that's what we are after to Quicken that seed Gene within you because that seed Gene came predestinated with the attributes and characteristics of God if we can only get to that seed Gene of God within you and shine God's light upon the Jean seed you are going to come into His Image and likeness amen you can't get nothing else out of an orange seed beside oranges amen so when the seed Gene of God which we are after is in your soul we are shining the light of God's word upon the Jee seed to bring you to your full [Music] manifestation that's why we bringing you into the shik glory realm hallelujah amen this is the time when the sh of Glory is shining in its fullness in its brightness you may not like the process you may think the process is difficult you may think the preaching of the word is hard amen but that's the full strength of the sunlight to shine upon your jeans SE yes Lord thank you Lord thank you Jesus amen thank you Lord praise the Lord now in each level of that Court was different kinds of Lights amen the out Outer Court had natural light yes and then the the inner court so you had the outer Court there you had the inner Court which had Candlestick light there they had Candlestick light typing seven Church ages amen but if you know in the holiest of holies there was no light except sh Glory light Amen to be in there the priest relied on the Shak Glory coming down to give light amen wonderful thank you praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen so as you approach the Brazen altar we sing how far we come amen we are here at the entrance amen came in at the outer court amen at the East End but when you come to Christ you're coming to the Brazen altar amen but you can't just stay there amen you got to go from the Brazen altar right into the holiest of holies into the place where God reveals himself in his glory personally to you amen it is christing me the hope of glory amen amen hallelujah now many people think when they first come to Christ they gain it all but remember when you first come to Christ you're a baby in Christ yes yes amen you are drinking on milk yes amen hallelujah so you don't have full Authority and power as a babe God may show you glimpses of it amen but you don't you are not a mature son yes Hallelujah you don't amen people you have the legal right to get it all when you come to Christ because the Bible says as many has received him he gave power to become sons of God Amen but there's a there's a long there's a long process or a distance between the birth and coming to maturity amen mature Sons amen amen hallelujah the one having full Authority when you comeing to Christ you have the legal right to have the authority amen but then we are on this journey and the ministry has come to connect you the ministry has come to take you out of your bab stage amen out of your baby stages amen hallelujah the ministry has come to take you out of drinking milk and come and give you a solid diet amen a protein diet amen amen hallelujah amen people want to Pat on their back people only want to be Associated amen with their family members Amen to be associated with some family member in the church to be Associated we have come to take you away and connect you with your heavenly family amen yes amen am to show you an eternal section in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah am people are more affected listen to this people are more affected when their parents say I'm going to disown you but when they heavenly father says if you don't change your ways I'll disown you they're not affected so they Place more value on a Earthly family Hallelujah you know brother Bram tells us that one day or I think Paul brings it up very nicely and he says that he had a friend and one day his friend told him Billy have you done you anything wrong did I do anything wrong to you B says no he says I'll come you had a father like this with such a great ministry and you never told me about him you are the testimony yes believe Paul says he didn't know what to do so you know those people you like to play games with soccer with have bries with one day when you they around now the bride is going to be seated in judgment yes and they're going to walk through yes and they're going to Bow their heads in shame and they're going to look up and see you there they say but you told me that joke and we shared Coke I didn't mean to rhyme that but you never told me about eternal life amen you never told me you follow an end time message you never told me you believe a prophet you never told me that he was Revelation 10:7 you never told me it was Malachi 4 all you gave me was briani and bride now my chops are about to be bried where will you stand on Judgment Day yes amen amen hallelujah amen sections of the book attribute sections the one who God thought about before he created anything yes yes [Music] yes what a what a what a privilege to be the first thought of God Amen yes amen the attribute thoughts of God people he thought of you and he said these people they'll be in my image and likeness amen amen hallelujah he thought about us the ones who are in His image the ones who would have his character and his nature the one after his likeness the ones who would function like God Amen Hallelujah in an age where people are malfunctioning these people will function like God Amen they will have no defect they will have no spot they will have no wrinkle amen amen hallelujah predestinated this way amen hallelujah you are not made in China neither are you made in Germany but you are made in the Eternal thoughts of God's mind amen give God praise and rejoice around these things this day salvation has come to you amen hallelujah thank you better than German engineering amen is the engineering of God designed by God Amen thought of by God yes made by God Amen people like to stamp their products made in 19 something made in established in 19 something stamp upon your soul in your gen established before the foundation of the world Amen you have a stamp there amen and there's no date to that stamp because you are created in the eternities where there was no time thank you Lord thank you Jesus praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen thank you amen In His Image function like God people who act like God people who think like God people who speak like God people who forgive like God people who love like God people who have the life of God amen the ones who have the mind of Christ and knows what he wants done with the word amen we know we have to become all the that the word is written about us and we will not leave one word unfulfilled amen it's like John and Jesus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness how many if you can say that amen if we must fulfill all the word amen yes amen God's thoughts are his word expressed amen God is careful careful to watch over his word Amen brother brandom is telling us that God's thoughts are his word expressed God is careful to watch over his word amen so if we are the word of God we are the word made flesh the thoughts of God the attributes of God the Bible also says that his word will not return void amen amen you can't return back to God empty if you are the word of God there's a prophecy in the Bible his word will not return void amen so if he sent you into this word as a seed form you can't come back to him as a seed form you've got to come back to him as a mature son and daughter of God thank you yes Lord don't be like that one who eat his talent amen when the time of the Rapture comes you presenting yourself back in seed that's right Haven come to maturity amen not coming to dominion and power and authority amen amen amen let's put away childish ideas let's put away childish things and let's move on to maturity amen yes thank you amen hallelujah in the only holy Place amen now we were talking about these three places do you know that in the Holy place there were three items of furniture the table of shoe bread and everything inside is made of gold the golden Candlestick the beaten gold and the golden Al of incense gold typifies both faith and Divinity beaten gold speaks of which of that which is by Divine by workmanship pure gold speaks of that which is divine by Nature amen now many if you know the prophet says we are likened down to pure gold amen praise the Lord now people have always had a problem with the veil hallelujah how many of you can say Amen to that amen hallelujah Let's uh go to the Mighty God unveil before us praise the Lord I just want to background this before we go on preaching Mighty God unveiled before us preached in 1964 now I want you to know that the Seven Seals were not revealed only in that 7-Day session or 8 days if you are thinking the prophet revealed the Seven Seals under that six seven days eight days and he stopped you are solely mistaken that's right you'll find many times the prophet speaking and he says the the mystery that we now have when he's talking about who is this m and he's talking about things that are to be he says it's because of the opening of them Seven Seals amen so all of these Mysteries were under the seven seal amen right you'll find sometimes he's preaching I hope this is okay with you maybe you haven't heard these things before but I'll tell you this morning how to read the message of the hour amen when you are reading things like Satan's e God of this evil age you know those are coming under the first four seals come on now think those are coming under the for Force Riders yes but when he's talking about Mighty God unveiled before us yes who is this mic things that are to be that is coming directly under the seventh seal amen yes Lord so don't think I'm going to read the seven seal book and think you're going to get the revelation of it amen Christ is a mystery of God revealed under the seven SE is preaching that out of Amen praise the Lord wonderful thank you we got Mighty God unveiled before us paragraph 148 we'll read a bit here CU I want to background it he says paragraph 148 we notice another thing in the Old Testament I have the scripture here in Exodus that the old badg of skin what did he do now when you're reading this I want you to realize that you are the veil right now that's why I'm reading this that old badg of skins what did he do he hid the glory of God from the people the badg of skins even people couldn't see it because it was a skin that held it the glory of God was behind the skin and now the glory of God is beyond your skin amen amen yes amen thank you two people for saying Amen to that and now the glory of God is behind your skin amen that's right and the Traditions don't see it yeah your mother can't see it your father can't see it your brother your wife your husband can't see it but the glory of God is beyond your skin it's inside the veil where his word was amen what was on the inside of that skin back there that old badg of skins there was no Beauty we should desire it not talking about Jesus and when it was made flesh and dwelt amongst us it was still no Beauty we should desire it and now the same thing is today yes I know some of us think we're very beautiful but according to the scriptures there's no Beauty in us that they should desire us they don't we according to them our message is not desirous and the same and now the same thing is today there's nothing in a man or woman that can be desire it it's what is in behind it that's what it is while you say that fellow I know used to be a drunker he used to do this I don't care what he used to be what's hid behind that skin what is behind there that's what counts the people is blinded the Skins blind the people they say I remember when that woman used to to I know what she used to but what about now see them skins that once was Badger but now he's hiding the glory of God got it housed behind it it was on an animal but now it's housing the glory of God oh it just s of makes you shout amen you are housing the glory of God hallelujah this is not for Doctrine I am not preaching Doctrine amen I'm not trying to establish a Doctrine amen I am trying to show you present tense reality you carry the glory of God within you amen thank you Lord you'll die with it if you take it as a Doctrine thank you Lord thank you amen hallelujah housing the glory of God and so can the your your skin be changed tonight to be made a housing place for God God dwelling in humanity amen hallelujah look the old Badger skins we find out behind it what inside of there was the word and the word there also was the showbread The Ark was sprinkled but what was it the sh of Glory was in there and this is where I'm I'm want to also strike because remember our title is that the sh of Glory is coming over your seed word your Gene of God to bring you to a manifested s so now he's saying the word is a seed and it cannot bring forth until the sun strikes it amen the sun has got to be upon the seed to make it bear to make it come forth and that's the only way you take the word take the word of God in your heart and walk into the sh of glory amen when you do it'll bring showbread Mana that's only GI for a separated people message of the hour shortbread manner only for a specific class of people did brother Brandon just detail how you can walk into sh Glory he says keep taking the word taking the word taking the word amen then you step into sh Glory yes Lord thank you you Lord when you do it'll bring showbread Mana that's only gift who separated people the only thing that can eat it that's permitted to eat it REM Revelation 10 now only one man is permitted to eat it oh come on church amen the only thing that can eat it that's permitted to eat it is just the people who are permitted and knows it oh yes Paul said here changing from glory to glory you see finally it comes till it's back to its original Glory oh this is the original glory amen we will not stop till is a full restoration of the original glory of God back in the church back in your life back in your home yes Lord hallelujah it's just like the seed of a of a morning glory the seed of a flower it falls into the ground the seed of corn falls into the ground what's the first thing it comes up it's a little Sprout goes to a tessel from a tessel back to original grain that's exactly what the church has done it come from L the Wesley now back to

last paragraph and now it's ripe amen oh give me some ripe mangoes amen give some of your righte food I want to eat of you amen I want to fellowship with you amen like we Fellowship back there in the Eternal part of God's mind when we shout it together amen when we dance together in the spirit of God when we shout it for Joy amen yes Lord you know when you meet your old friend hey you you remember our good old days how we used to do this how we used to do that that's the same way we think of one another amen do you remember when we shouted for Joy amen yes yes that's hallelujah amen Joy is not that girl that used to like in shot for some guys only come alive when they see woman hey you think they're a quiet guy but let them put them in front of a woman yo different person they're like a peacock now their feathers are out but when we come into the presence of God they like an Indian [Music] minor amen no feathers amen praise the Lord amen then you want to be like a sparrow going to be quiet amen nobody can say Amen to that Hallelujah online audience why you doing these things cu the spirit of the Lord is speaking to you amen amen amen praise the Lord Lord did we finish no now it's ripe to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning his same Ministry watch what the glory is coming to do now make you a Son of God to bring you back to the same Ministry the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost the same one that came down in the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from Glory unto glory to glory and is back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same signs and wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation it's from Glory unto glory and the next will be changed from this Glory into a body like his own glorious body when we shall see him somebody give God praise that's where your expectation should be amen we are on the brink of that amen hallelujah being changed from Glory unto Glory hallelujah amen oh what a glorious message we have amen what did he come to do Amen to take us back to the original amen original Faith amen Malachi 4 came to take

promises Revelation 10 is our scripture amen praise the Lord hallelujah all the mysteries of God that's been hid in them in the pages down through them years would be ripened bring forth the age of

out of his message amen your Perfection is coming out of his message your body change will come out of his message amen hallelujah amen the original seed that God placed within you you must bring forth after your own kind yeah you know there's a law in the Bible in Genesis 1 let every seed bring forth of its own kind if you are Original Seed you must bring forth of your own kind and how if you know that the spoken word was the original seed and still is the Original Seed amen so when you allow sh of Glory to come upon your Jee seed the end result will be a son and a daughter of God who has the spoken word in their mouth give God praise amen hallelujah that's what's hidden in your seed that's what's hidden in your DNA to stand in the image of God after the likeness of God and speak like God [Applause] amen amen amen amen amen you have been placed here under the time of life amen H Sarah was there under the time of of Life Mary was there under the time of life amen and the bride is placed strategically in the time of life in Revelation 10 amen therefore the mighty Angel comes down in the time of life yes therefore it stood there amen 28 minutes the cloud to signify the time of life had come for the bride amen amen to bring that Original Seed to life and bring the Original Seed within you to full maturity so whatever is in your seed must produce the fruit of that seed the sh
