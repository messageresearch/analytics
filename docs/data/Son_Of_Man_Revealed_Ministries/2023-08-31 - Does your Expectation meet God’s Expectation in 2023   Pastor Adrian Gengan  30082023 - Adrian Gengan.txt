created us to be like you yes yes the father we see Lord that that Dominion was taken away from man to the fall but Lord you walked away Lord to bring man back to his full position father and Lord it seems father that Amnesia has taken a hold of us father the Lord we cannot recognize that we were Sons and Daughters of the most high God yes the church was in a condition just in a ritual and in a religion oh God but father you sent a prophet messenger Lord Jesus yes to reveal the word of the hour Lord Lord when that seventh angel began the sound of God the mystery of God was finished oh God and we saw ourselves father that we were always a part of you Lord we were taken from your very own side like he was taken out of Adam oh God and Father we were created in your image and likeness and you're bringing us back to that image rather and I pray Lord that father even as Lord we open up ourselves to the revelation of the Our Lord that we will grow in faith grow in wisdom growing knowledge father Yes and I pray Lord that your father Lord recognize who we are in this time in this day Lord and I pray Lord if you increase anything Lord we ask you to increase our revelation of you Lord increase the Lord our wisdom increase our knowledge oh God that by the Lord we can be built up in the Holy Oracles of God at this time father because Lord as we hear the word of God lord we are receiving a faith within us oh God the Father even the atoms of this body cannot contain it lord it's got to change life to change Enoch oh God and Father we want such a revelation we want such a faith oh God in this hour Lord and Lord we can feel it pressing within our Spirits Lord we can feel that groan from the universe parts of us Lord the Lord we are ready to burst forth to God Amen Lord I pray Lord God that you will awaken us father God lord even tonight Lord speak to us through your word oh God lord we come laying aside our own thoughts our own desires our own ways Lord and our Lord we will submit entirely now Lord both me and the congregation under the mighty hand of the Holy Spirit Lord and I pray Lord that your father bless us even as we read your word oh God lord may we draw strength from it Lord may we draw wisdom and knowledge from your word our prayer in the mighty name of Jesus amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen agrees you all in the precious and the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen it's good to be back in the house of the Lord amen and it's a it's an honor it's a privilege to serve the Lord he's the king of kings and he's the Lord of lords amen amen amen hallelujah amen you know one of the days the prophet says that these doors will be shut and he says we'll meet in other places amen and if you were not found in church on the regular Wednesdays we're not going to tell you where the other places were [Laughter] amen hallelujah amen amen I tell you you know what this is the honest truth now when the doors are open and the people didn't desire to come in you think they're going to desire when the doors are shut no they're going to be so content and say finally the doors are shut to have an excuse amen but I tell you we are in the final climax now we're in the final hour if you can see the Finish Line yes hey man and we are running with all that's within us the Holy Ghost within us is giving us another action when others are falling away we are stepping up amen amen my others are stepping out of line we are stepping in line amen praise the Lord and we thank the Lord for the Holy Ghost we thank the Lord for the message of the hour amen that is keeping us alive amen let's jump to Romans chapter 8 verse 23. amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 23 amen just want to speak a little thought because God has an expectation of us amen praise the Lord I mean if you believe God is an expectation of us amen if you go to my slides there amen praise the Lord but my question you notice my Wednesday messages are turning into questions last week we spoke on do you have the Life of Christ amen does your expectation meet God's expectation in 2023 amen because you can only get what you expect amen amen now God's got a high expectation of us it's exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask to think but I'm asking you what is your expectation does it meet God's expectation in 2023 amen so we'll read for you in Romans 8 23 it says now he's talking about people groaning right about creation groaning but he's saying we focus on that a lot and you're saying see creation is groaning see the earthquakes see the tsunamis see the tornadoes see the floods creation is groaning but 23 tells us not only they 23 brings it back to us but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit now who is talking here the apostle Paul now do we have the first fruits or now in the Harvest we in the Harvest so they are the first fruits of the spirit now but we are the Harvest when all the mysteries of God are revealed amen yes the things that they even desire to look into was Kept For Us yes the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grow within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body amen amen so this is talking about sons of God recognizing their position amen and it's there in verse 23 that he's telling us that we will no longer focus on what creation is doing yeah on Creations grown alone we can all say hey look at the floods look at the wars look at this creation is groaning the Earth is ready to put forth the birth pain but can you hear the groan within yourself that's what 23 is telling us we ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to whip the Redemption of our body you may be seated the Lord of blessings to the reading of his word so the next time you hear somebody say look at the signs all around us ask him brother what about the grown within you is there grown within you is there a cry within you amen waiting for the adoption what is your expectation amen creation knows what they are expecting they're expecting sons of God to come back into their full Authority Amen to come into their full manifestation creation is waiting for its master amen hallelujah oh praise the Lord take a minute I'm good on your amens now take a minute and cast off now your flesh amen and listen to what I am saying creation is waiting for its master and you are the master every time you go without speaking to a situation creation is disappointed yeah yeah amen every time you walk away from a situation that is presented to you to display the power and the authority of the almighty God you are not meeting God's expectation amen you are not training yourself you're not using the opportunities yes that God is presenting to you yes amen so we ourselves are groaning within ourselves waiting for the adoption some are not waiting for the adoption some have no expectation but the scripture says we are waiting for the adoption let's put up the scripture we are still on the scripture amen we are waiting for the adoption what is the full adoption the body change amen now was Abraham's retested waiting for his body to change to come back here amen God made him made him wait 25 years waiting for the adoption amen waiting for the adoption until his body would change so that he can produce Isaac the one that was promised amen amen so you and I are waiting now to come back into our original condition and that is the final stage of redemption when we were put on a new body yes amen don't lose focus of that yes don't lose sight of that because that's what is around the corner for us amen amen that's what's on the way for us now here is Jesus in John 10 10 34 talking to them they want to Stone Jesus amen they want to Stone Jesus in John 10 34. is it not written in your law I have said you are gods amen John 10 34. amen is it not written in your law I have said you are gods if he called them Gods to whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken then what about the one whom the father Sanctified and sent into the world Amen amen how then can you accuse me of blasphemy for stating I am the son of God amen so God Sanctified amen and he says then how can you accuse me of blasphemy for stating that I am the son of God now we Sons and Daughters of God did Jesus send us into the world Amen go to John 20 there amen John chapter 20 and see if Jesus sent us into the world yes so we are learning that the father sent Jesus amen amen into the world amen and yeah Jesus in John chapter 20 now this is after his resurrection then she said Jesus unto them again peace be unto you as my father has in me even so send I you amen amen amen so as the father sent Jesus Jesus is sending us yes amen and Jesus will not leave us without the power and the authority that he had so he goes on to say here in verse 22 and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive he the Holy Ghost amen receive he the Holy Ghost amen so you see the requirement when you are sent requirement is the Holy Ghost and that is where people have lost the interest the Holy Ghost amen I'm going to reiterate this because the prophet says here in amen in the message adoption he's talking about the sons of God that are coming on the face of the Earth because that's what we are talking about right sons of God coming back into Dominion Authority he says men that are sons of God are amateur gods amen now you can't be amateur God in power only and then you miss the rest of what Christ was Christ was love Christ had love in his heart amen amen Christ said Peace Christ their Joy the fullness of the Life of Christ amen so he says here men that are sons of God are amateur gods Genesis 2 says they were Gods because they were and full dominion over the Dominion of the world he gave him dominion over some things he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took it over so the prophet of God to say that Satan now has the legal right amen but then Christ came and took away that right amen by his sacrifice on the cross Christ took back the Dominion authority of the Earth amen and any comment give it back to us right he says but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again amen amen Christ has already done it but the sons of God must be manifested and Christ is waiting amen for Sons and Daughters to rise up to take it over again what he says waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets to the top and we come through seven Church ages yes was it like a pyramid being built up amen so we have come to the top of the pyramid amen when the full sons of God will be manifested when a sons of God manifested at the fullness of time when they get to the top of the pyramid when sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out and take every Power that Satan's got away from him amen the only Power that Satan is walking around with right now is the one you let him have amen praise the Lord we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God right I just want to detail this let's go to the next slide here you'll see yes the pyramid we're talking about yo what he's saying waiting for the fullness of time now if you go and do a study on that the fullness of time is when the seventh seal is revealed amen amen as the seventh seal being revealed yes waiting for the fullness of time so that part has been fulfilled the seventh seal has been revealed amen amen amen when the pyramid gets up to the top where are we on the pyramid are we at the bottom I'm trying to make the sport come alive to you amen just make you see it when the pyramid gets to the top yes when the full Suns now as we get to the talk what will happen the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him amen yes so what is happening as we get into the top our Revelation is increasing amen amen amen that Revelation is producing a perfect faith amen so we know the prophet says now because we are living in a time where Satan is coming without reasoning again amen from even within the framework of the message trying to destabilize the faith of the people but we we've got to have a experience like Moses had amen amen so no matter how slick the tongue of a man is no matter how many days and chorus arise in this time no matter how much they try to explain that the days of Miracles is passed or what we're expecting was for another day was for another age was for another season that the days of Miracles are over Amen to you it's not over yes amen thank you amen amen to you it's not over yes it's not over because we are waiting for one final healing that's right amen so then how can the days of Miracles be over how can the days of healing be over when the final healing is the healing of these bodies yes hallelujah amen so to me to you who are waiting for the adoption of our own bodies the days of Miracles are not over we shall experience our final Miracle amen yes Lord amen the greatness of all miracles the healing the final healing of this body amen hallelujah we can say that we have been to the back side of the desert we can see we've been called into the presence of God and we found his power that was in the bush search through US yes Lord thank you Jesus amen we have talked to God face to face amen hallelujah and all the devils in the world cannot explain away this word of God to us amen Satan can't do anything with us amen we have passed from death and to life we are born again we are filled with the spirit we are on the sacred grounds right now and the devil can't put one foot in here where we are yes small thank you amen we've got an anchor in our soul and nothing but nobody can ever take its place in there oh yes Lord amen that's a revelation we have of God we have many face to face and we know what we are talking about amen now it's very important for us to know the word of God yes amen we must know the word of God don't ever think that you don't need to know the word of God Amen we need to know what the word of God says amen how much of time are we spending to get to know the word of God amen amen how much of time are we spending to get to know the word of God do you know Jesus took time to know the word of God Jesus didn't come Born Into the world with his memory full of scriptures with his memory full of the word of God amen Jesus took time to study the scriptures he knew the word of God at the age of 12 he knew the scriptures yes amen he knew what the word said about him at the age of 12 how old are you how much of the world do you know what the word says about you amen Jesus at 12 knew what the word says about him amen here you'll find Amen in the scripture the next slide there you find amen let's go back do I have a chair yeah and Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man now if there was a growth in Jesus there needs to be a growth in US amen we can't be stagnant amen Jesus is growing in wisdom and in stature and here Jesus says the prophet now say Jesus said it is written see constantly it is written it is written and then when you can eat Satan with the scripture yes he's just as powerless as he can be oh no I don't need to memorize the scriptures I don't need to read the scriptures when the scripture begins to take root in your heart it becomes personalized to you you stand upon your scripture amen you stand on your scripture and you tell Satan it is written amen it is written amen when you put back what your own words what did the prophet say when you say it is written and when you hit Satan with a mouthful when you eat Satan with the scripture he's just as powerless as he can be amen praise the Lord now let's just go back to that pyramid slide there amen the one before this okay so this is now taking away we are following a progression let's read the next quote what the prophet is saying in these last days the true bride will come to the headstone can you see where we are we'll come to the headstone and as we come she will be a what a super Church a super race as she nears him oh yes amen that's God's expectation of us remember what's the title now does your expectation meet God's expectation in 2023 that's God's expectation as we are nearing The Headstone yes have we come into Union with him amen as the ants don't come cry and Grace Grace then God's expectation is to have a super church and a super race as she knews him amen but ask yourself are you a super race are you a super Church amen they in the bride will be this is now what it means then the bride will be so much like him amen they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image that's the statue of a perfect man there will be in His image no I don't have patience I just speak my mouth I don't have patience I got a raging temper amen I was born this way and I die this way that's not the life of Christ amen I say things without consideration I just speak then you are not a prisoner to Christ that's not the life of Christ amen amen you speak things and you hurt people you speak things and you tear down people it's all full of the Life of Christ supposed to build up people amen amen supposed to build up people yes amen hallelujah it says here there will be in his very image this is in order for us to be United with him they will be one now what did you read that all of that needs to be done for what to be United with him now can we not have that and still claim to be United with him how can we not have the Life of Christ when that's his expectation of us and claim to be United with him right then we are fooling ourselves amen this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God now what's Christ the manifestation of the world and we become now the manifestation of the world the final manifestation of the word amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen one more quote there just to bring this to life the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the world now Jesus the prophet of God he's saying the True Vine with the fullness of the word only the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word may do the very acts of power that Jesus did can do the very acts of the power that Jesus did amen amen the True Vine of with the fullness are we the True Vine with the fullness now spirit and word will amen yes do the very acts of Jesus very acts of power that Jesus did amen then as she nears The Headstone oh yes becoming like him through the word amen Jesus will come to death the bride and groove Jesus will come that the bride and groom may be forever United as one you see this word that we have in the end time what does it come to do we are becoming more like him through the word Through the Wood amen through the revelation of the world hallelujah amen we are becoming more and more like Jesus amen the prophet of God says that Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts what does continuation mean doesn't change just continues amen Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen the book of Acts has not stopped it continues amen amen amen there may have been a disconnect because of unbelief they may have been a disconnect because people never cause a true revelation of who they are amen but the prophet is saying if Christ ever comes into the true church if the anointing ever comes into the true church it'll be a continuation of the book of Acts if they get a true Revelation now this is very important because they when light is in its fullness because remember arise and shine that light has come the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen the full sunlight is shining it is the rising of the Sun in the shower and with the rising of the Sun comes the true revelation if they get the true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church now we can't be deceived by that we have the true revelation of the two spirits and by God's spirit that's the Holy Spirit design and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen but what is needed Revelation Revelation produces faith in us and that Faith takes away the power from Satan amen hallelujah because faith is rugged faith is bold yes amen Faith don't care what the enemy says amen Faith knows you to finish work Faith Looks To the Cross and it's a finished work Faith looks to what Jesus Christ has already done yes well thank you you see what does if mean if means that conditions need to be met that if you do this because it does not guarantee that you will get a true Revelation but he's saying if they get it not just any Revelation true Revelation amen amen so what's required Revelation and the Holy Spirit which is God's spirit to discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her how will it be tortured or defeated as when Christ would stood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert and what did God go to the word right Satan hates revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen how many of you want to Prevail over the gates of hell amen then say Lord give me the true revelation of your word give me the fullness of the Revelation Lord the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against us that you know is Matthew 16 verse 17. amen when the Lord told Peter the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against this amen hallelujah so the enemy today tries to say the days of Miracles his past there is no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is only emotion it's only work up so the enemy has challenged and his challenge must be met the only way we can meet the challenge of the day amen when denominations call people away and put them in this organization let the woman cut their hair wear makeup and Men of live all kinds of life amen trustees deacons Pastors in the church they get some PhD lld that's a requirement Jesus never did require a man to have that Jesus requirement Jesus expectation is for them to wait in Jerusalem until you endured with power come on Amen then you are witness to me that meets his challenge that meant the enemy's challenge that made it amen in that day it will meet it in this day are you hearing what the prophet is saying what will meet the challenge the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost in us because the Holy Ghost is the teacher he's the guy amen he takes the word and he brings the amen the word to pass in our lives amen praise the Lord Hallelujah glory to the Lord amen blessed be the name of the Lord just wait for this lights amen that's the name of Jesus Amen Hallelujah [Music] praise the Lord so God's expectation in fact some don't like high expectations but God is very high expectations the Bible says that God's ways are not our ways the Bible says his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts amen so maybe you don't have much of an expectation of you yourself even hmm but why don't you say Lord let me meet your expectation amen and the only way that you will know what God's expectation of you is through the message of the hour amen you go anywhere else they will not tell you what's God's expectation of you they have prayed they are preaching a gospel to make you comfortable in this world amen all they know about is how God's Gonna bless you in this life how God's Gonna Prosper you in this life how are you going to get finances in this life how you're going to get a home in this life how are you going to get a car in this life that's all they can teach you amen but God has an eye expectation he wants us to take back full dominion over the Earth he wants us to have full Authority because where man fell from God has been working God has been laboring amen God has been building up the church to this point amen where Sons and Daughters of God will rise up to their full potential now you may not have that expectation but I want to Burnt an expectation inside of you I want to show that seed of expectation inside of you for you to meet God's challenge of the day thank you thank you amen if you look what's happening there in Revelation chapter six you'll see that all hell unto the fourth seal is on the Earth the Bible says that Hell Followed that horse rider and the horse ride his name is death amen the horse ride his name is death and hell is following him so what you are seeing on the earth now is Hell being full manifested on the earth that's why people have gone insane amen they have gone completely insane you look all around you there's corruption amen moralities are down at an all-time low if maybe there's even no morality amen there's no decency amen it's all over the place we can't claim that we have the Life of Christ and we have the spirit of Christ yet we love Satan's idols we love the things that has put us out there for him to distract you I'm going to be playing here and talk some names because these are his men If You Love Lionel Messi if you love Ronaldo or if you love all of these figures and his images Beyonce and you love all of these worldly figures how can you say you have the love of Christ when you love them they are not God's people but they are your own model you fight for them you'll talk to them you'll secretly go and see the latest fashion the latest style maybe the music whatever it is what are you listening to what are you feeding on we can't go to Satan's distraction Satan has got his people on the Earth and then we look to them and then refreshing after them and then say we have the Life of Christ and we have the spirit of Christ then we try and take the world and bring it into the church God's people are separated people amen those people are peculiar people amen we are supposed to be in Oddball to the world amen amen Hallelujah you find amen even in this day that we are so prideful amen nobody can tell us anything amen praise the Lord some of you need to kill that Spirit within you now and say amen amen amen some of you think some of us think we can do no wrong that our thoughts are perfect but God is presenting trials and situations because he knows he needs to work on your character but every time you let loose amen how does God test your faith by pressure but if you blow up every time God's Gonna keep trying you on that point God's Gonna keep trying you on that point until you bring the Flesh on the subjection amen so if you find yourself constantly flaring up angry for no reason amen always want to be in the right the Bible says why don't you rather take the wrong why don't you pee see when you sing to be like Jesus so Meek and lonely amen praise the Lord but the spirit of God wants to work but we have things that even hinder the spirit of God moving in our own lives we can find maybe we are spending time with the world maybe we were spending time reading the Bible maybe you're spending time praying but we are not conquering other things in our lives Prophet says we need to become prisoners to everything prisoners to Christ and then we forsake everything you know prisoner has very limited rights maybe he has none at all a prisoner goes on what the prison the one that's holding him captive allows him to do so if we are captive to the one who's in our soul the Holy Spirit it's only we do what he allows us to do amen so what how is God molding you and shaping you let me ask you something to meet God's expectation in 2023 what do you need to forsake we just went through some of God's expectation of us as we near The Headstone what is requiring us for us to come into His Image and likeness what is hindering you from reaching God's expectation for your life what do you need to surrender what do we need to surrender what do you do we need to let go of amen I'm sure we all want to grow in the things of God I'm sure we all want to grow up to the headstone but he says in order to be United with him we need to be in His image we need to be the word amen so what is that one little thing that you need to surrender and say Lord help me with this help me with this Lord amen ask yourself even now Lord you know what's your golden witch you know what it's there right now yes because the Holy Spirit Will convict you amen and bring that thing to light yes but if you willing heart is what God is looking for to say Lord I want to surrender this even now in your presence I want to surrender this even now Lord Jesus I I want to shock the devil if I've done somebody wrong I want to say I'm sorry please forgive me if I've done somebody wrong please forgive me if I've said something wrong to offend somebody to hurt them please forgive me yes yes ah it's a hard thing eh because now you're coming against self pride Jesus says love your enemies amen do good to them that hate you yeah do good to them that persecute you and say all matter of things against you you know they said something about the prophet he said there was something remarkable about his character that you couldn't tell you his friends from his enemies yes amen now it sounds like we want to choke and we can't get the words out I am sorry it's so hard to conquer ourselves you know and you won't do anything but make you a child of God to go to somebody and say you know what I was wrong I'm so sorry for doing that please forgive me amen amen amen but the Holy Spirit knows do you know the holy spirit is the design of Hearts amen our thoughts amen now imagine now let me just bring this to a close imagine you get to a time where you can see all things and God is now talking to you and he says you know what you say you miss this blessing here because of this you couldn't forgive you couldn't love yeah and you missed all of it because of this yeah if God could take you beyond the curtain and show you how many blessings along life's journey you missed yes amen and you know sometimes these things come through a genetic line you know the prophet says I'm half Indian I'm this third so he had a temple like a buzzo right how many of you know the prophet says that you remember you want to take his gun and shoot those boys and somebody killed his dog and he took his gun and he just wanted to go after them and shoot them at things amen if we are finding the old nature rising up something is wrong the birth hasn't been proper New Birth if we're finding the old nature amen popping up something is wrong yes we need to go back to the cross where my sin was washed away because at the cross is where the bird starts New Birth amen New Birth coming in amen Lord fill me with your spirit unless you be born of War to the end of spirit amen hallelujah why come so far and leave the little things undone we can have deep Revelation and no deep things but when it comes to the Life of Christ maybe that's even it's in our attitude you know the attitude even to the word of God is very important amen the word of God being preached is the most the prophet says it's the most important thing amen you can while somebody is preaching you can have something in your heart yes do not agree with the brother you be reverent in this presence of God Amen amen you respect the man that is standing behind the pulpit the prophet says many times he says when somebody is preaching he says why don't you eat the chicken and throw away the bones but now Satan comes and walks even there we feel like we know so much we feel like we are highly revelated and we are condemning what the brother is saying while he's preaching the Bible says why don't you have a teachable spirit amen and why don't we say Lord I don't understand maybe things right now but Lord your word is being preached and I'm hearing it and Faith cometh by the hearing of your word amen we should never develop a bad attitude especially now because I tell you why we can create that what's that word Superior ority complex where we feel we are so highly revelated and we look down upon everybody else I'm not talking about denominations now yeah yes amen I'm talking about within the framework of the message because sometimes people can misunderstand this when we are dealing with Spirits we are attacking the spirit and not the people amen sometimes things may be said from here and you will misunderstand what's being said because we are attacking the spirit behind it the lukewarmness the coldness but then now you feel hey we are here and everyone else is not here and then we start to look down upon other people yeah we can't hear anybody else amen there's something wrong there's something wrong you need to check your experience now you need to check your experience Hallelujah amen praise the Lord so God has an expectation for us in 2023 are we meeting God's expectation amen are we meeting God's expectation have we come up and we come up by The Headstone amen now I don't I half these things you know I was not planning to say my message was something different but the Holy Spirit has now shown a spotlight into each and every one of us we all know what that thing is and even now amen you need to make it right before the Lord amen hallelujah and if that person is still alive you have the opportunity because the prophet says well the Bible even says you go to that person and you make it right it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me you make it right you still got the breath of life but the Joshua is telling me today about somebody that what's he 42 42 went to bed last night how many months old is a baby four months old so the mother is sleeping with the baby in the other room she comes this morning to wake him up he doesn't wake up he's gone at 42. in his sleep how do you know when you will go amen don't put off for today what you can do and fix today don't wait for tomorrow because tomorrow may never come amen if you wait for tomorrow you may wake up in another place in another dimension amen like that remember that Christian ruler when you woke up one day he saw you were separated far from Father Abraham and he could do nothing to go back to the Earth do you know how many millions of people reality in another dimension that could wish for one opportunity to come back to the Earth just one opportunity or do you know how many of them wish they could send somebody back to one their loved ones but they'll never have that opportunity but you and I in the land of the living where Redemption is stood here the only time you can do something about it is you're on this Earth if the Lord takes you away that you can't do anything about it neither can your loved ones do who's on the earth now go and pray like Purgatory get you out of purgatory do Penance do all of these things pray to this saint they can't do anything for you so today if you hear his voice why don't we make those things right amen amen amen Hallelujah yes why don't we make it right and say you know what Lord Holy Spirit I hear what you are saying and I'm a Child of God I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God and I want to be obedient to the spirit I don't know if you know that's as good as power

operate in that level of power without the character he had the character Hallelujah let's all Stand Together amen let's just bow our heads Close Our Eyes amen praise the Lord thank you praise the

defeats the enemy it takes the word amen hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord Glory hallelujah amen let's turn it off praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus he's worthy of praise
