[2:47] amen amen
[2:49] we know the whole event was supernatural

[2:57] old amen she's no longer the youngest
[2:59] now
[3:01] so god has been adding
[3:03] amen
[3:04] and
[3:05] we pray for the grace of god actually
[3:07] this morning started off as good and bad
[3:10] morning we had to lose
[3:13] one of our
[3:14] pets
[3:16] it was actually something that was given
[3:18] by my late brother
[3:19] and we got the news early in the morning
[3:21] so it didn't start off as a good day but
[3:23] because god is in control of all things
[3:25] amen circumstances
[3:27] and uh we pray that the grace of god
[3:29] will continue to keep us amen yes amen
[3:32] amen we've got our bibles we'll turn to
[3:34] the book of james
[3:40] the book of james chapter five
[3:47] reading from verse 16.
[3:57] confess your faults one to another and
[3:59] pray one for another
[4:02] that jay may be healed amen amen
[4:05] confess your fault one to another and
[4:07] pray one for another the j may be healed
[4:10] the fictional fervent prayer
[4:14] he's not just asking for any type of
[4:16] prayer
[4:16] the effectual
[4:19] fervent prayer
[4:21] not just of anybody
[4:23] but of a righteous man yeah
[4:25] a veiled
[4:27] amen amen elias
[4:30] was a man subject to like passion that
[4:32] we are
[4:34] and he prayed earnestly
[4:36] that it might not rain
[4:39] and it rained not on the earth by the
[4:41] space of three years and six months
[4:45] so he didn't pray absolutely right
[4:47] he didn't just go and say this must
[4:49] happen he prayed earnestly yes
[4:53] because he could understand the time and
[4:55] season that he was living in
[4:58] and he knew that the divine promise that
[5:00] was pertaining to him amen
[5:02] yes
[5:03] and he knew his position in god
[5:06] he didn't just go and pray without
[5:08] knowing his position
[5:10] he knew he was a prophet of god he was a
[5:12] man sin from god and standing under that
[5:15] position and authority he prayed
[5:17] earnestly amen
[5:20] but yet he was a man like
[5:22] passion as we are yes
[5:25] an ordinary man from the outside yeah
[5:29] but his prayer gonna tap into the
[5:31] supernatural amen
[5:33] amen through his prayer he's gonna be
[5:35] living into another dimension amen
[5:39] because it's gonna grant him access to
[5:41] that dimension amen amen and it rained
[5:43] not on the earth by the space of three
[5:46] years and six months
[5:50] and he prayed again amen
[5:53] and the heaven gave rain
[5:56] and the earth brought forth a fruit
[5:59] amen
[6:00] amen you may be seated we thank god for
[6:02] the reading of his word
[6:04] we're gonna speak speak tonight
[6:06] on prayer being the inherent requirement
[6:09] of the believer
[6:12] prayer we know that as a christian you
[6:14] must read your bible and pray every day
[6:17] but we're talking about prayer being an
[6:20] inheritance requirement
[6:22] that means a believer cannot do without
[6:24] it it is essential yes yes you cannot
[6:28] walk the spiritual journey without a
[6:31] life of prayer
[6:34] jesus
[6:35] being on the earth 2000 years ago before
[6:38] the start of his ministry had to go and
[6:41] and go alone
[6:43] into the desert
[6:45] for a time of prayer
[6:49] a time of communion
[6:51] because why as much he was living in
[6:53] this world he had to tap
[6:55] back into the dimension
[6:57] where he come from
[7:02] daniel before you go and find out what's
[7:04] going to happen to the end time you have
[7:05] to go in a time of fasting and prayer
[7:08] amen
[7:09] abraham when he had the experience of
[7:12] god and god god went there and told him
[7:14] what's going to happen to sodom and
[7:16] gomorrah he went into a time of prayer
[7:19] amen an intercessory role yes amen
[7:23] he didn't just you see sometimes
[7:26] desperation will put us in an
[7:27] intercessory role
[7:31] but there's different needs and there's
[7:34] different circumstances in prayer
[7:36] we might come tonight and we're all
[7:38] praying and asking god for a certain
[7:39] thing in our life yes
[7:41] good that's needed yeah but when you
[7:44] come to understand
[7:48] the real plan of god in your life
[7:51] and where you fit into the body yes it's
[7:53] no longer just spring for your necessity
[7:55] which is normal which is your normal
[7:57] christian praying and reading your bible
[7:59] yes right but we're talking about a
[8:02] different type of prayer
[8:04] we're talking about a prayer when a man
[8:07] understands his position in christ amen
[8:10] we're talking a prayer to a man where
[8:12] the third pool has been the opening of
[8:14] the word has come to him yes where the
[8:17] seals have been unlocked to him amen
[8:20] and he understands the time he's living
[8:22] in the hour that he's living in
[8:24] and he's not praying like every other
[8:27] believer should pray
[8:29] it's just more than that yeah amen
[8:31] [Music]
[8:38] jesus a illustration one time in mark 9
[8:41] 27 when he was casting out
[8:43] the spirit
[8:45] this demon
[8:46] he said but jesus took him by the hand
[8:48] and lifted him up and he rose and when
[8:50] he was coming to the house his disciples
[8:51] asked him privately
[8:53] why could not we cast him out
[8:57] yes and he said unto them this kind
[8:59] come forth by nothing but by prayer and
[9:02] fasting yes
[9:04] now
[9:05] they were there with jesus
[9:09] now jesus was showing them an example
[9:11] that these this you must also gonna
[9:13] you're also going to be doing
[9:15] you're also going to be living this life
[9:16] of prayer
[9:18] amen because when you
[9:20] come into the life of prayer you're
[9:22] going to tap
[9:24] into another dimension amen and then
[9:26] you're going to see these spirits
[9:29] because your prayer life
[9:31] in through prayer you're going to be
[9:32] contacting all these spirits
[9:34] because the bible says we rest a lot
[9:36] against flesh and blood
[9:37] amen so you at your workplace you got
[9:40] your mates fighting with you coming your
[9:42] boss is coming down in you
[9:44] sometimes you don't realize that we
[9:45] wrestle a lot again flesh and blood yes
[9:48] maybe after a lovely revival meeting on
[9:50] a sunday the world was so nice and then
[9:51] you have your monday morning blues
[9:54] because those demons can't stand
[9:57] you're rejoicing from within you
[9:59] something taking place within you that
[10:01] demons are contacting that spirit within
[10:03] you
[10:05] amen
[10:06] do you see what i'm saying
[10:08] you a person now who is not living that
[10:11] prayer for life will not be able to
[10:12] identify with these things so jesus is
[10:14] saying to them and he said under that
[10:17] this kind come forth by nothing but by
[10:20] fasting and prayer
[10:22] amen
[10:24] amen
[10:26] he says
[10:27] in one of his quotes he says
[10:29] in the message spiritual food in due
[10:31] season he says
[10:32] but he embodies himself taking your body
[10:35] and my body
[10:37] and gives you gifts gives me gifts
[10:40] and through these gifts he makes himself
[10:43] known amen amen so if god embodies
[10:46] himself
[10:48] look what he says now but but the the
[10:50] devil he said one time jesus cast out
[10:52] some demons out of a man from kedara and
[10:55] he went into the herd of swine is that
[10:56] right he said demons are powerless
[11:00] unless they embody it
[11:02] so they need to be embodied too
[11:05] from their dimension they tapping into
[11:07] this dimension to embody human beings
[11:12] so why can't we from this dimension tap
[11:14] into the other dimension
[11:16] into the supernatural so christ can his
[11:19] spirit can embody us and use us
[11:23] because demons i am budding people yes
[11:26] otherwise they are useless
[11:28] they are powerless
[11:31] now if they are doing that how much more
[11:33] we need to emtap into the other
[11:36] dimension amen and what is our access to
[11:38] that to prayer amen
[11:41] we heard the message the other week
[11:43] about the sixth sense by faith amen
[11:46] because it was revealed to us yes it was
[11:48] by divine revelation amen we know that
[11:51] we chapting to the sixth dimension to
[11:53] that sixth sense yes amen
[11:56] and now what what exists are we using
[11:58] our communication to prayer
[12:01] right amen
[12:07] matthew six verse five says when the
[12:09] prayers
[12:10] thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are
[12:13] amen yes oh you know the hypocrites
[12:16] how they love to go amongst the
[12:17] politicians
[12:19] and come
[12:21] come amongst all these big dignitaries
[12:25] and have all the other faith groups they
[12:28] call it and come together
[12:30] and calling themselves christians
[12:34] for they love to pray standing in the
[12:36] synagogues and in the corner of the
[12:38] streets that they might be seen of men
[12:43] verily i say unto you they have their
[12:45] reward
[12:46] but thou and dark prayers enter into thy
[12:49] closets amen amen you see this prayer
[12:53] now is gonna be between you
[12:55] and god amen
[12:57] this prayerful life i'm talking about is
[12:58] when you are separating yourself
[13:01] from the things of this world
[13:03] when you are separating yourself from
[13:05] the five senses
[13:06] yes
[13:07] you are separating yourself from this
[13:08] dimension
[13:10] which is full now with demon power
[13:16] and when thou were shut thy door
[13:20] see it becomes a lifestyle
[13:23] prayer becomes your lifestyle yeah
[13:26] pray to thy father which is in secrets
[13:29] and thy father would see it in secret
[13:31] shall reward
[13:33] amen you don't have to go and show
[13:36] everybody how you're praying show
[13:37] everybody i pray for the sick i'm do
[13:39] this and go and pray in the secret amen
[13:42] amen and what you do in secret you will
[13:44] see it happen
[13:46] in
[13:47] you'll have your testimonies come out
[13:48] and open your head and the brother said
[13:50] this this happened to me but you know in
[13:52] secret your spring amen the brothers say
[13:55] i got this job but you know he was
[13:56] praying for his brother you had a
[13:58] concern for his brother
[14:00] [Music]
[14:01] or amen
[14:01] come you have a lovely meeting under the
[14:03] service but you know during the day
[14:05] before the service you were praying amen
[14:08] you didn't tell everybody about your
[14:09] spread but your spring yes
[14:11] yes
[14:15] and you know what i'm talking about only
[14:16] if you know what i'm talking about where
[14:18] you had those secret prayers you're just
[14:19] praying sometimes somebody comes in your
[14:21] mind but you know god the holy spirit
[14:23] sometimes you're led by the spirit of
[14:24] god and holy spirit brings a person in
[14:26] your thoughts and you start to pray for
[14:28] them i suddenly say i was in this
[14:30] situation but thank god i've been
[14:32] delivered from this
[14:34] amen
[14:35] sometimes you've got to be sensitive to
[14:37] the leading of the spirit amen amen
[14:42] but when you pray use not weighing
[14:44] repetitions
[14:46] you don't ask us to use high words
[14:48] and uh go and quote the scriptures and
[14:50] everything when you pray yeah it's a
[14:52] communication
[14:54] between you and your father amen amen
[14:57] between christ and his church yes yes
[15:00] between the wife and the husband
[15:02] this is a love affair
[15:04] prayer is your open door of
[15:06] communication
[15:07] don't just go to god and say i want this
[15:09] i want our want or once lord give me
[15:12] this give me that give me this give me
[15:14] this
[15:15] amen
[15:16] amen don't run it like how you run your
[15:18] country here a social welfare country
[15:21] but that's what our country is about the
[15:23] social welfare country
[15:27] this is a love relationship yes
[15:30] can you imagine
[15:31] you know
[15:32] you're when you're cutting a or you have
[15:34] your husband and wife situation or even
[15:36] before you get married you're courting
[15:38] and every time your girlfriend comes to
[15:40] you or your wife comes to you and say i
[15:41] want i want her one
[15:43] we're not coming and complimenting you
[15:45] without coming and giving some good
[15:47] words to you
[15:48] and you're just demanding from you
[15:52] now we know that concubines do those
[15:54] things
[15:55] but our wife wants to
[15:57] rent a service
[16:00] now we got to go and praise him
[16:02] we got to worship him
[16:04] we're going to exalt him
[16:06] we
[16:13] [Music]
[16:21] she wanted him
[16:23] she was in love with she was in love
[16:24] with the king
[16:26] she just wanted him amen
[16:29] oh why don't you want to be one say i
[16:31] just want to see him i just want to
[16:32] embrace him
[16:35] i mean think about what a communication
[16:36] that is now
[16:38] because prayer is communication now
[16:40] imagine when you go by someone and keep
[16:41] demanding things
[16:43] now
[16:45] god understand your needs trust me you
[16:47] want to meet with your
[16:48] needs are we talking about your attitude
[16:51] yes in the way you're approaching amen
[16:55] and you'll know
[16:57] when you have that loved one
[16:59] no matter what she is asking you but
[17:01] she'll come to the right attitude
[17:03] and that beautiful
[17:05] female characteristics you can never say
[17:08] no to it amen ask any father when the
[17:10] daughters come to them
[17:12] so you know what i'm talking about amen
[17:15] now can you imagine when you approach
[17:17] god it's the same thing amen
[17:20] you'll be saying we love him
[17:22] we're saying we are safe from what he's
[17:24] done
[17:25] let's let's be honest to ourselves
[17:27] are we just saying lord
[17:29] bless our need give me this give me that
[17:31] give me that
[17:32] well those things you do in your morning
[17:33] prayer you don't have to but it's the
[17:35] in-between prayer
[17:37] you don't want to talk about the
[17:38] in-between prayer
[17:39] your communication with him all the time
[17:41] amen
[17:45] so he says
[17:48] use not vain repeat repetitions as the
[17:50] edens do for they think
[17:53] that they shall be heard or they're much
[17:55] speaking
[17:55] [Music]
[17:57] be not ye therefore like unto them for
[18:01] your father know what what things you
[18:03] have need of before you ask him amen
[18:08] after this manner therefore pray he our
[18:12] father which chat in heaven
[18:14] hallowed be thy name
[18:16] so there's a reverence amen
[18:19] to our lord amen yes
[18:22] we don't just take his name in vain we
[18:24] don't just call out his name in vain
[18:26] because even the demons recognize that
[18:29] name yes but but christians don't know
[18:31] the power of the name amen and we just
[18:33] use that name and we watch people
[18:35] cursing that name we watch it in the tv
[18:37] and everything people cursing the name
[18:39] of jesus and we take it anyhow yes
[18:42] but even demons are terrified of amen
[18:44] amen
[18:46] [Music]
[18:48] i was speaking to someone the other
[18:50] night
[18:51] and he was telling me they had an
[18:52] encounter with a demon spirit
[18:56] and the only thing
[18:57] this person eventually could say i am a
[18:59] son of god
[19:01] and that's what he said the demon left
[19:05] so even demons are terrified
[19:08] but people take the name of jesus
[19:11] without reverencing his name yes
[19:14] so your attitude in your prayer
[19:17] must be one out of respect to him and
[19:19] recognizing the recognizing the lord god
[19:22] almighty amen whom you are approaching
[19:26] we are privileged because of the blood
[19:28] of jesus we have access
[19:30] yes
[19:31] if it wasn't for them to remember i
[19:33] praised
[19:34] going in for you with your petitions
[19:42] amen
[19:44] and because of him we can cry out abba
[19:46] father amen
[19:48] he said thy kingdom come
[19:52] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[19:55] heaven amen
[19:58] you see what that is he's already
[19:59] showing you that you this prayer is a
[20:02] person who recognized the entire seals
[20:04] book the entire book from genesis to
[20:07] revelation in other words this person
[20:09] understands redemption
[20:11] amen because it must be done in earth as
[20:14] it is in heaven this earth need to be
[20:16] reformed he needs to come and rule and
[20:18] reign on this earth because now it is
[20:21] the god of his evil age it saved his
[20:22] kingdom
[20:24] give it to him temporarily
[20:28] give us this day our daily bread and
[20:30] forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[20:33] debtors amen you cannot pray or go into
[20:35] prayer with unforgiveness yes
[20:38] if you are only bitterness
[20:41] you're in strife yes or you ever
[20:43] unforgiving heart you cannot go to your
[20:46] god and pray
[20:49] you are wasting your time go and correct
[20:50] the error yes
[20:54] and lead us not into interpretation
[20:57] but deliver us from evil
[21:00] aren't we grateful amen amen
[21:02] that we we know that we're living in the
[21:04] space house but we are god is able to
[21:07] deliver us from evil amen
[21:10] because we have the holy spirit that is
[21:12] leading us amen amen and the minute you
[21:15] go down the wrong path he's going to
[21:17] bring conviction yes
[21:19] remember
[21:21] the prophet of god in his ministry
[21:23] you have to have every time he wants to
[21:25] go down the wrong path for a single day
[21:27] try and do something against the word of
[21:29] god when you file his body in any way
[21:31] what happens the angel of god was there
[21:35] we are given the holy ghost sin same
[21:37] thing
[21:38] right every child of god might be there
[21:40] every son the daughter is gonna let by
[21:41] the spirit of god amen
[21:44] but we've got to be sensitive
[21:46] now if you don't have that prayer for
[21:48] life
[21:49] how are you going to be sensitive to the
[21:51] leading of the spirit amen
[21:53] because you're only trapping natural
[21:55] things yes if you're not
[21:59] not in your spiritual diet yes
[22:02] that means you're not tapping the
[22:03] supernatural right so you are so used to
[22:05] the earthly thing you're so used to your
[22:07] senses that you're not sensitive with a
[22:09] spirit is speaking try to warn you or
[22:10] something
[22:12] so take heed to the leading of the holy
[22:14] spirit
[22:19] for this is the kingdom and the power
[22:21] and the glory forever
[22:23] amen
[22:24] amen for if you forgive
[22:27] men their trespasses your heavenly
[22:29] father will also forgive you
[22:31] it's a simple theory amen
[22:33] for if you forgive not mend their
[22:35] trespasses neither would your father
[22:37] forgive your
[22:39] so if you want to live
[22:41] a life where you don't have forgiveness
[22:44] from god
[22:45] and you want to go to him and ask him
[22:47] for this and that and you want your
[22:49] needs to be met
[22:50] but you don't want to forgive your
[22:51] brother yeah
[22:54] then go back
[22:55] and ask yourself
[22:57] do i also want god not to remember my
[22:59] prayers
[23:03] the prophet of god said prayer changes
[23:05] sickness to health amen hallelujah
[23:09] change your sinners to sins yes
[23:12] how many of you got a loved one that you
[23:13] that you know that he's a sinner that's
[23:15] god gone down the wrong road
[23:18] go on your knees yes yes go and claim
[23:20] them
[23:21] it's never too late amen
[23:24] it changes sinners to sins
[23:27] it's prayer
[23:29] he says you may laugh too much
[23:31] yes
[23:32] you may shout too much amen you may eat
[23:35] too much but you'll never pray too much
[23:38] and i will be true that is amen
[23:41] because any time you want to pray
[23:43] anytime you want to separate yourself
[23:45] from god what happened the devil knows
[23:47] that
[23:48] and he hinders that prayer life
[23:51] watch how the devil comes and heals your
[23:53] prayer life
[23:55] because remember as soon as you go into
[23:56] that in that zone of prayer to pray
[24:00] temptation comes
[24:02] what happened to jesus in the wilderness
[24:04] temptation came
[24:06] so
[24:07] god yourself amen
[24:09] amen
[24:12] i would that men pray everywhere lifting
[24:15] up holy hands
[24:16] so you'll never be able to pray too much
[24:20] he says look at hezekiah
[24:23] when the prophet went up and said all
[24:24] right izakaya you're not coming off the
[24:26] bed
[24:29] it was pronounced to him
[24:31] god's done said you were going to die
[24:34] right there and where you reach
[24:37] imagine now i did they knew when the
[24:38] prophet of god speaks he's trusting the
[24:40] lord
[24:42] and the prophet of god death upon him
[24:46] and as a kaya studied it over
[24:49] if he just add 15 years longer see
[24:52] so he's looking at he said you know what
[24:54] this was my life
[24:56] that is pronounced upon me
[24:59] but if i can just have this time
[25:01] i can sort out a few things yes i can
[25:04] put my life in order hallelujah
[25:07] the things that i need to sort out in my
[25:09] life for my family and for us for the
[25:11] kingdom of god that i have here i can
[25:14] sort it out yes this is about the time i
[25:17] need
[25:18] sometimes you are put in a desperation
[25:21] you are put with a sickness
[25:23] you are put in a financial constraint
[25:25] yes
[25:26] something something's not working out
[25:27] your way
[25:29] put you in a time of desperation amen
[25:32] where are you going to complete your
[25:33] case to god yes
[25:35] and you have your interest yesterday yes
[25:38] amen
[25:39] and you know you can complete your case
[25:40] you know that because that's what the
[25:42] word says amen
[25:44] but you can't just go there and just
[25:46] want something
[25:50] because see what he says here
[25:52] you've got to give god a cause
[25:55] a reason
[25:57] now he didn't say
[25:58] just because i can get out there and
[26:00] ride around in a chariot and show the
[26:02] people i'm a king
[26:06] no he wanted to rebuild the altars of
[26:08] the god
[26:09] and a few things have to be done to get
[26:11] the kingdom in order right amen
[26:15] you see so
[26:16] he wasn't just gonna bargain for his
[26:18] life now
[26:20] just so he can just carry on just living
[26:22] and just enjoying life
[26:24] no you wanted to do a few things yes in
[26:27] other words like how the bible said seek
[26:29] first
[26:29] the kingdom of god and is righteousness
[26:34] then all these things shall be added
[26:36] unto you amen
[26:41] and he prayed that god would give him 15
[26:43] years longer and he wept bitterly amen
[26:49] amen they affect your fervent prayer yes
[26:51] amen
[26:52] just went to god
[26:55] he said god i beseech you
[26:58] to consider me yes
[27:00] i have walked
[27:02] before you with a perfect heart what we
[27:04] said
[27:11] so before you go
[27:12] to enquire or to go your petition make
[27:16] yourself that righteous man come under
[27:18] the blood amen amen go with repentance
[27:21] amen god and repent with us yes amen and
[27:24] the bible says he is faithful and just
[27:26] to forgive us amen
[27:29] how many of us can say that tonight we
[27:31] walk before him with a perfect heart
[27:33] amen i walked before the lord with a
[27:36] perfect heart and i asked you to
[27:38] consider me amen
[27:42] and god almighty jehovah
[27:44] reconsidered that man's case because he
[27:48] prayed amen
[27:49] amen a prophet of god coming with the
[27:52] word of god yes a prophet is never wrong
[27:56] and he pronounced death upon him
[27:59] by this man's heart
[28:01] a man with an upright with a perfect
[28:03] heart
[28:04] [Music]
[28:06] a man that would effective prayer
[28:08] can go and weep bitterly before god can
[28:11] move the hand of god amen
[28:14] [Music]
[28:17] but he had a just cause
[28:20] he didn't just go and said lord i want
[28:22] just to be healed
[28:25] lord
[28:27] if you can give me this better job
[28:30] i can do better things i can help others
[28:34] i can help people i can do things again
[28:38] lord if you can just heal me of my
[28:40] sickness i can go out and be a witness
[28:43] for you
[28:47] don't make it selfish about yourself
[28:49] amen what i said in the first place this
[28:51] is not the prayer where you're coming we
[28:53] all are here we all got needs and we all
[28:55] pray for the needs but this is the type
[28:57] of prayer where you recognize yourself
[28:58] in the kingdom of god
[29:01] you see this king he prayed for the
[29:02] kingdom he taught things out in the
[29:04] kingdom
[29:07] so when you want something from god is
[29:09] because you must be kingdom minded amen
[29:11] yes amen
[29:12] don't be selfish you are your own
[29:14] personal family
[29:15] [Music]
[29:17] god will be kingdom minded because we
[29:19] are part of a body hallelujah
[29:22] we are part of a body of believers which
[29:24] is a mystical body of christ amen
[29:29] you've got to see the bigger picture
[29:32] amen
[29:33] you've got to recognize your position in
[29:35] christ amen you've got to recognize the
[29:37] authority behind that prayer amen
[29:39] [Music]
[29:43] and god almighty jehovah reconsidered
[29:46] that man's case because he prayed think
[29:48] of that almighty god that had pronounced
[29:51] dead upon the man reconsidered this case
[29:54] my that's too much for me
[29:56] the property saying this
[29:58] drink jehovah to immortal
[30:00] to one of the earth would reconsider his
[30:03] word what he said to him
[30:06] how much will he do it to us if he did
[30:08] it under the blood of bull and goats
[30:11] how much would he do it for us amen to
[30:13] the bride of jesus christ
[30:16] the one who's taken his name in this
[30:18] hour amen amen the one who the one who
[30:22] when people reject
[30:23] it there mocked it there
[30:25] and she said no i will go and bear the
[30:27] cross
[30:28] with jesus amen
[30:30] i will take up my cross and follow him
[30:32] though they scorn at me though they mock
[30:34] at me i will choose signs with jesus
[30:37] amen
[30:39] now god is all as ways of doing things
[30:42] look like he would have spoke right back
[30:45] and told him but i considered your case
[30:47] again
[30:48] i'm going to let you stay for that
[30:50] if you do that but he didn't
[30:52] he spoke to the prophet
[30:55] you see yes yes amen you see what i'm
[30:58] saying now yeah you cannot come
[31:00] without this word
[31:03] he spoke to the
[31:04] prophet
[31:05] and the one of god comes to them prophet
[31:08] and when you go you go back because we
[31:10] come because you recognize that you're
[31:11] part of this word yes amen you don't
[31:14] just pray
[31:15] you think you're praying by revelation
[31:19] and the revelation of the word comes to
[31:20] a prophet
[31:22] amen
[31:25] now god has ways of doing things he said
[31:28] i considered your case i'm going to sit
[31:30] to let you stay for that if you do that
[31:33] but he didn't he spoke to the prophet
[31:35] and sent the prophet
[31:37] all the way back up there again to tell
[31:40] him
[31:42] all right god heard your prayer amen
[31:46] see
[31:47] god revealed to the prophet what was
[31:49] going to happen
[31:50] come back
[31:51] your days is considered and you're going
[31:54] to come off the bed now in three days
[31:57] yes amen
[31:59] you got some
[32:02] politics and so forth put on him
[32:06] and hezekiah come of the bed
[32:08] and was made well
[32:10] now see what prayer does
[32:12] prayer is not exactly bringing god down
[32:14] to man
[32:16] it's bringing man up to god
[32:19] amen
[32:20] what i said earlier
[32:21] from the first dimension they're coming
[32:23] to this dimension they're coming down to

[32:29] to god's dimension amen and he is coming
[32:31] to dwell in you
[32:33] and use you amen
[32:35] amen is the opposite of satan's kingdom
[32:37] yeah
[32:43] it's bringing up man
[32:44] it's bringing man up to god as you pray
[32:48] you lose sight of these ugly things
[32:50] amen
[32:52] you sway out in some way else
[32:55] yes way beyond and on and on till you
[32:58] come into his presence amen
[33:01] amen where's that into the shekinah
[33:03] glory that was shown in type in the old
[33:06] testament yes
[33:07] amen but now you have access because in
[33:10] old testament only the priests could go
[33:12] there into their presence
[33:14] but to jesus christ you have access
[33:17] amen
[33:20] and then

[33:50] whether the person is a testify of him
[33:52] or not
[33:53] he knows whether that person is going to
[33:55] go and rejoice and uplift his name amen
[33:58] look at that man that blind man yes
[34:02] the prophet said you are healed
[34:04] and he went but he never received his
[34:06] sight but he's claiming that he's healed
[34:08] yes amen and he went and he's saying
[34:10] he's healed but he still didn't really
[34:12] besides he's sitting in a in the barber
[34:15] shop and he's saying his heels
[34:17] but he still didn't receive his side but
[34:19] before you know it he just said it like
[34:21] that when he was trying to score at him

[35:00] amen and to help others to see you amen
[35:05] now then you lay there before god and
[35:08] say god will you consider my case

[35:14] oh god yet today don't you believe so
[35:18] every night he confirmed his right chair
[35:20] in the building
[35:22] if he did it then he says now i believe
[35:24] he will do it again tonight don't you
[35:27] and i believe he can do it again tonight

[35:51] now
[35:52] you're really trusting god for a need
[35:57] don't go appreciately amen
[36:00] and don't go reluctantly without faith
[36:03] you must go knowing there is a god that
[36:05] can make that promise come to pass amen
[36:08] you must go knowing that you are here to
[36:10] the promise
[36:11] that you're that is part of your
[36:13] redemptive blessings
[36:16] he says
[36:19] see if you just go up and say lord bless
[36:21] so and so
[36:23] god don't take interest much to that
[36:26] but when you really get down to business
[36:30] when your little boys and girls pray
[36:32] and get down to business do you do that
[36:35] in school do you ask god to help you in
[36:37] school you see you're writing your exams

[36:44] you for the exams

[37:56] they got a situation they will go and
[37:58] consider it before the lord amen
[38:00] and you know in life life is such that
[38:03] is not every time you are comfortable
[38:05] just to share with certain of your pains
[38:08] with anybody
[38:10] there are certain things you only can go
[38:12] and explain to god
[38:14] because i'm talking about
[38:15] that that special time where you just
[38:18] you can't even talk you're just going to
[38:19] cry
[38:21] and he knows what you're going through
[38:23] would you just cry out bitterly
[38:27] but god answers the prayer amen
[38:30] because god is looking at your condition
[38:32] and your rightful attitude towards him
[38:34] he's got the time for you amen we need
[38:37] to make the time for him amen he's
[38:40] always got the time for us
[38:42] god is somebody that you will not
[38:43] disturb yes amen 24 7. amen

[38:53] all the patience to hear you
[38:56] you know what i'm talking about
[38:58] sometimes you want to talk to somebody
[38:59] and they don't have the time for you
[39:00] they're always on a busy schedule right
[39:02] take your time off go into nature
[39:05] or lock yourself up in a closet go into
[39:07] somewhere where no one's going to
[39:08] disturb you put your phones off
[39:10] that's the worst most irritating thing
[39:12] when you prank
[39:14] go into nature you don't have to pray in
[39:15] front of everybody in your house
[39:17] when you the best time i know is to
[39:19] always enjoy when i drive the car that's
[39:20] why i never used to like lift clubs i
[39:22] never took lift clubs to work
[39:24] no matter how costly the fuel price was
[39:26] i always wanted to be alone because my
[39:28] best time was when i was driving the car
[39:30] and praying
[39:31] the best praise and worship is when
[39:33] you're alone in the car and you're
[39:34] praying
[39:36] that's why i always like to be alone in
[39:38] the car i don't like taking any lift
[39:39] clubs
[39:41] [Music]
[39:50] hebrews 4 16 says let us therefore come
[39:52] boldly unto the soul of grace that we
[39:55] may obtain mercy and find grace to him
[39:58] in time of need amen

[40:11] you know that you
[40:13] have this redemptive blessing
[40:16] then go to him

[40:23] wasting your time yes it's going to take
[40:24] your medical either ego of the effect

[40:42] jesus said
[40:43] he that united my word and believe it on
[40:45] him that sent me
[40:48] as everlasting life
[40:51] not a big believer
[40:52] it's absolutely something that happened
[40:55] yes
[40:56] a conversion of the heart that changed
[40:59] you
[41:00] and brought you into another realm
[41:03] men are misunderstood christians women
[41:06] men boys and girls are misunderstood who
[41:09] lived in those places because it's
[41:11] contrary to the natural run life of life
[41:15] natural run of life among people of the

[41:37] about the old testament now
[41:39] the same manner that they ate on the
[41:41] ground right that would come every day
[41:43] they had to eat it for the day they
[41:45] couldn't keep any extra
[41:47] because that was the what god told him
[41:49] you had to refresh manna

[41:54] and the next morning you come again

[42:10] but that in the hidden place never with
[42:13] the away amen

[42:19] and a man walking there when the high
[42:21] priest went in beyond that veil that
[42:23] veil had separated the holy from the
[42:25] holy of holies when he walked in there
[42:27] the veil dropped behind him
[42:31] that man he was even soundproof he was
[42:33] shut off from all the world and the
[42:35] surroundings
[42:36] he don't nothing in there but the living
[42:39] in the presence of god
[42:42] and a man a woman that ever walked into
[42:44] that kind of glory of god the whole
[42:47] world shut off behind him amen
[42:50] amen and right now we are now eating
[42:53] from the manner that never went away how

[43:15] everything is shut off
[43:17] you don't see life like i used to see
[43:19] amen
[43:21] when you come under that kind of glory

[46:31] nothing but an old dead stick of an
[46:33] olive tree but once laid in the presence

[47:53] took off the tree but sinners and
[47:54] lukewarm church members become dry
[47:57] sticks oh they can't produce
[47:59] amen with some kind of a memory that
[48:01] some time there was a supernatural god
[48:03] of the past oh we don't want to look at
[48:05] what happened in the past we want to
[48:07] look what is happening in the now
[48:09] we want to look at the ever-present god
[48:11] working amongst the people doing the
[48:13] same works that he just did he's doing
[48:15] now because he said greater work than
[48:17] these years shall do yes

[48:27] amen amen amen yes it must be a
[48:30] continuation of the book of acts amen
[48:36] that sometimes there was a supernatural
[48:38] god of the past that had life and way
[48:40] back there but if you believe and lay in
[48:43] his presence yes amen how are you going
[48:46] to lay this presence without a prayer
[48:47] for life
[48:48] how are you going to tap into that
[48:50] dimension how are you going to be in
[48:51] that atmosphere
[48:54] it will produce the same thing to you
[48:58] you will realize that you were born sons
[49:00] and daughters of god and will yield the
[49:02] fruit of the spirit but you can do it
[49:05] out there on the courts you can you got
[49:08] to do it in yeah that inside hid away
[49:14] not

[49:32] some days it was like raining
[49:34] other days it was sun would shine and
[49:37] nighttime would be dark and stormy he
[49:40] had his ups and downs that's the way you
[49:42] see people
[49:44] oh they say we're eating the good manner
[49:46] of god that's right but they are where
[49:49] are they living they're living out there
[49:51] eating in an atmosphere that should they
[49:54] should not eat
[49:55] [Music]
[49:56] in oh don't don't denominate around this
[49:59] world
[50:00] when you have the leadership of the holy
[50:02] spirit making this world fresh and fresh
[50:05] amen
[50:07] don't take a certain doctrine and
[50:08] denominate around it and then leave the
[50:10] holy ghost
[50:12] don't take a theory of a man you'll be
[50:14] stuck with the man's theory
[50:16] amen
[50:18] and then you forget to follow the
[50:20] leading of the spirit and god wants to
[50:21] give you something fresh
[50:25] the next man he had another light that
[50:28] was the man of the altar
[50:30] it was lit by seven golden candlesticks
[50:32] in little lambs and sometimes them lambs
[50:34] burnt low and they smoked up the
[50:36] chimneys and you know our lamb does
[50:38] smoking goes out
[50:39] and a man who comes to a place where he
[50:41] comes into the church
[50:43] out of the courts out of just a lukewarm
[50:45] church member and comes up to a little
[50:48] pretty good life in christ
[50:50] he separates and thinks from there but
[50:52] he's still living under lights and will
[50:54] get dim and smoke up an artificial light
[50:57] when he once walked in behind the holy
[50:59] earth of holies
[51:01] walked into the presence of god
[51:04] and the veil falls behind him
[51:06] there behind him there's a pot of manna
[51:09] where he can eat every day amen every
[51:13] hour of the week
[51:16] there's no end to this revelation it's
[51:18] an inexhaustible fountain of life he's
[51:22] just gonna get higher and higher and
[51:24] higher
[51:25] gonna move from glory unto glory amen
[51:30] that's where he's living in the shekinah
[51:32] glory
[51:33] we're in
[51:34] the interlocked wings of the cherubim
[51:36] the great puller of fire and the
[51:39] shekinah rested and is living under
[51:41] there
[51:43] he can't be nothing but a real genuine
[51:47] christian any time
[51:49] atmosphere amen amen
[51:52] men and women are living that they are
[51:54] misunderstood yes that's what you find
[51:57] when you got the baptism of the holy
[51:58] ghost your life is misunderstood yes
[52:04] because you're not going to compromise
[52:05] with every wing of doctrine you're not
[52:06] going to be tough to and fro right and
[52:08] they're misunderstanding you amen why
[52:10] you just can't hear them out
[52:14] how come we can't convince those people
[52:20] what type of people are this
[52:22] if they want to recognize that these
[52:24] people are not led by man but they are
[52:26] led by the leading of the holy spirit
[52:28] amen and they having they recognize that
[52:32] they are a continuation of the book of
[52:33] acts amen
[52:35] they become peculiar they don't hear the
[52:38] things of the world or if they do they
[52:40] don't pay attention to them
[52:43] amen they just move on amen god never
[52:46] put them in there for nothing oh amen
[52:49] you're not putting here for nothing amen
[52:51] amen
[52:52] god never come for just any haphazard
[52:55] way
[52:57] he said prayer is not perhaps prayer is
[53:00] a sincere thing
[53:03] prayer is talking to god
[53:06] can you talk to god about revelation
[53:08] can you talk to god without knowing who
[53:10] your god is
[53:11] without understanding the revelation of
[53:12] jesus christ so can a person sincerely
[53:16] go and pray to god without the
[53:18] revelation of his message
[53:22] praise not get down shut your eyes
[53:24] thinking about your washing
[53:26] or your work you're doing yeah yeah say
[53:29] lord help me and john and heal with
[53:31] jones and so forth that's not clear sure
[53:34] just repeating some words
[53:36] but prayer is to come into an atmosphere
[53:39] amen
[53:41] when you realize that you're in the
[53:42] presence of god
[53:45] and you're moving to them in the deepest
[53:47] of sincerity
[53:50] don't get astonished by people's
[53:53] high words in prayer
[53:55] people's uh

[54:49] done to me
[54:50] you stepped out into east territory
[54:53] remember job was guarded
[54:55] when god removed those guards from him
[54:57] then when he satan could go and touch
[54:59] him
[55:00] and that was god's permission
[55:17] otherwise if you like aaron's rod

[56:49] what are we speaking about tonight a
[56:51] prayer is an inevitable requirement of a
[56:53] believer

[56:58] rejoice evermore
[57:00] pray without ceasing amen in everything

[57:05] in christ jesus concerning you

[57:45] thanksgiving
[57:47] let your requests be known unto god and
[57:49] the peace of god would pass it all
[57:51] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[57:53] mind truthfully jesus
[57:57] just want to read a few scriptures
[57:59] 1 john 5
[58:02] 14-15 says
[58:05] and this is the confidence that we have
[58:07] in him that if we ask anything according
[58:09] to his will
[58:11] he hurt us
[58:13] and if we know that yes
[58:15] whatsoever we ask
[58:17] we know that we have the petition that
[58:19] we desire of him yes amen are you asking
[58:22] in your prayer
[58:24] mark 11 24 says therefore i say unto you
[58:28] what things whatever you desire when you
[58:30] pray
[58:31] believe that you receive them
[58:34] and you shall help them and when you
[58:36] stand praying forgive
[58:40] if you have ought against any
[58:42] that your father also which in heaven
[58:44] may forgive you your trespasses
[58:47] but if you do not forgive neither will
[58:49] your father which is in heaven forgive
[58:50] your trespasses
[58:52] ephesians 6 17 to 18 says and take the
[58:55] element of salvation
[58:57] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[58:59] word of god praying always
[59:02] with all prayer
[59:03] and supplication in the spirit and
[59:05] watching there unto with all
[59:08] perseverance and supplication for all
[59:10] sins
[59:11] amen amen
[59:17] and if there's any sick among you
[59:19] what the scripture says james 5 14 says
[59:22] is any sick among you let him call for
[59:24] the elders of the church
[59:29] and let them pray over him anointing him
[59:31] with oil in the name of the lord and the
[59:34] prayer of faith
[59:36] amen shall save the sick yes amen now
[59:40] let's take the scripture and analyze the
[59:41] scripture
[59:43] he says in the prayer of faith shall
[59:44] take firstly when you call the others it
[59:47] means you have faith
[59:48] in your scripture
[59:50] you took god at his word amen yes
[59:53] you was confronted about that scripture
[59:55] you were certain of god amen you had
[59:58] faith
[59:59] you had confidence in your elders yes
[1:00:02] you called them
[1:00:03] they came home amen they did their part
[1:00:06] what must happen now
[1:00:08] there must be a testimony amen
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:13] last quote
[1:00:14] now remember this christ in the true
[1:00:17] true church
[1:00:18] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:23] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:00:26] that the antichrist spirit would come
[1:00:28] into the church and defile it making it
[1:00:30] lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:00:35] it exposes satan
[1:00:37] revealing his works
[1:00:40] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:00:42] and the discrediting of god's word
[1:00:46] right down to the time he's cast into
[1:00:48] the lake of fire
[1:00:50] he fights
[1:00:51] that he cannot stand it he knows that if
[1:00:54] the people get the true revelation
[1:00:57] of the true church
[1:00:59] and what she is
[1:01:01] what she stands for
[1:01:03] and that she can do the greater works
[1:01:07] she will be an invincible army
[1:01:12] you know the devil is going to hinder
[1:01:13] your prayer life right he's going to
[1:01:15] hinder you from staying with the world
[1:01:17] yes
[1:01:18] he's going to make you look at the world
[1:01:21] as just a time gone by
[1:01:23] he doesn't want you to catch go into the
[1:01:25] holy of holies and catch this fresh
[1:01:27] manna
[1:01:28] every day to heed this man amen
[1:01:33] because he knows that you become he says
[1:01:35] that
[1:01:36] he knows he said he knows
[1:01:39] talk about satan he knows that if the
[1:01:42] people get the true revelation of the
[1:01:44] true church and what she is what she
[1:01:46] stands for
[1:01:48] and that she can do the greater work see
[1:01:50] satan knows this
[1:01:52] she will be an invincible army amen
[1:01:57] if they get a true revelation of the
[1:01:58] true spirits within the framework of the
[1:02:00] christian church and by god's
[1:02:04] grace my god spirit discern and
