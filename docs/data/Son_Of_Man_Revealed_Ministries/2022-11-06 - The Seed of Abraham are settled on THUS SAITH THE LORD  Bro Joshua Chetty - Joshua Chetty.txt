living on this Earth not unaware of the things that are happening amen yes we have been given foresight for knowledge because why God sent us here in this day amen and we receive that Sia amen we received that prophet in the name of the Prophet amen yes and how do we receive it by faith yes They will receive it by our own intellect no it was by faith that we received it and we believed it yes and therefore we can live under these promises amen thank you Lord tell our Bibles quickly to the Book of Genesis chapter 22. amen our faith that you have a beginning amen amen Genesis chapter 2 verse 15. and the angel of the Lord called upon Abraham Out of Heaven the second time amen and said by myself not by any man not by anybody else but by myself have I sworn save the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not without thy son thy only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and emulsifying I will multiply that seed as the stars of the heaven now here's Abraham the only evidence that is God that God has given him this promised son the one that is waited so many years for him he has the evidence now when God given him the Commandment to go up with thy son and sacrifice him and now he's going to destroy the evidence but he was obedience in the word of God because why he knew he's God Abraham had a personal relationship with his God and he knew that this is not man he knew that this God is a supernatural God and he was obedient to God and said that in blessing I will blessed thee and in multiplying I will multiply that seed as the stars of the heaven and he has the son which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies amen amen and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice a man obedience is better than sacrifice yes aren't you glad that we are part of this Royal scene amen that come to Jesus Christ which was part of Abraham amen and he saved him die seed are you included in that seed amen amen shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou as obeyed my voice you're the man with a covenants yes yes because before this in the scripture prior to that God is going to visit in the first time and give him a cover God call him firstly out of the land that he was in and you are to go into a Strange Land and he was obedient to say call yeah I'm saying man God called in for a total separation firstly from all the unbelief that he was separated from and because he could separate himself from all unbelief God will bless him and then God bring them to another land and then God gives him another visitation and makes a covenant with you amen and when God makes that Covenant with him he was typing Jesus Christ amen because that sacrifice that was put there and part in two and what a covenant means God was gonna make an agreement with him in a binding agreements yes an agreement that he himself cannot break amen and then it was separated when Jesus would be on the cross and his body is torn apart amen for you and I that Amen to that sacrifice God and make the continued the Covenant amen amen amen and when Abraham made a covenant God what was the instruction out there to be circumcised yes everyone that comes under the Covenant must be circumcised amen that is why we don't need those uncircumcised people to take our inheritance the inhabitants are falling upon the Earth God blessings are still upon the Earth because of the circumcise amen but the blessings fall under the rainfall on the just and the unjust amen the unjust I enjoying your blessings will blessing the men for you but they take these blessings and they want to say God did this for me see I prayed for this God bless me with a cow God bless me with a job God bless me with a house but when they change God's word no they will not be like Abraham to obey God at his words but there will be a people upon the Earth amen is supersede yes amen that will rise up in his last days amen amen and she will also come on the ministry amen because why there to be another patriarch in this day yes another one with a seven-letter words amen another one with the ending with the ham amen amen better to come on come on this Earth and through the Royal seed comes for this ministry yes and he goes that sowing amen let's see and in the last days she comes up she brings to life amen and she's that supersede so he's speaking on this morning the Seed of Abraham are settled upon thus said the Lord amen amen in other words out of God's word she doesn't do anything else yes because why the message is coming today not to make you a church member the message didn't come to make you add to a number in the church yes the message has come the opening of the word has come the Seven Seas have been revealed those seven times not in their voices for once so that you can be awakened out of spiritual Amnesia to make you recognize your position in Christ all right to make you recognize Who You Are and it comes so you let's supersede can be manifested in this hour amen and he says and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed now I want to take debt and take Revelation 10 18 11 that thou must prophesy again before Nation turned and Kindred amen and kings what is happening now out of you preaching the gospel the true gospel yes everybody else is in spiritual famine yes yes amen scrambling around for spiritual food trying to eat up the garbage bins yes and they're trying to find some inspiration that's why we got only a fourth anointed one yes trying to give them some inspiration hmm but you the nation of the earth when you give me blessed through you amen the fact that you hear now the rain falls on the just and the unjust yes Every Nation upon the Earth is only being blessed to you yes amen God the angels of God are holding those wings those wins for what for Wars amen yes two walls that passed behold the third world coming quickly it's about we are now going to bring the world on the brink of World War III amen but what's all in the wind what's oppressing this forces it's because you're upon the Earth amen and this right now the world cannot go on any longer man and destroyed marine life he's destroyed botany life he's destroyed the atmospheres um the world right now is a convergence the world is in birth pains yes he was waiting for this hour because this is the hour when the super city is being manifested amen this is the hour when a super seed has come and brought forth fruit in this hour it's it's the hour now when she shall possess the gates of the enemy amen yes amen and as we take from Abraham's life the problem of God says now Abraham was just an ordinary man he wasn't a super duper somebody people looked at him at that time he was an ordinary man just like every other man wasn't something special yes God never called him as far as we have any record until he was 75 years old [Music] so the rest of his life he was an ordinary man to everyone else his wife which was his sister being 65 years old at the time they had probably lived together since they were very young and she was Barren and Admiral children the god called a complete separation to separate himself from the rest of the world and from all of his people and from all of his kindred there was a special thing for him to do nothing that remind you of your life a God had to call you from wherever you was before you receive this message and you had to separate from all those things yes and then as you come in you have to further separate from the spirit of leadership that Spirit has even creeped into the message now yes right if the Lord carries any longer and the years go by you'll you won't make the difference between message sisters and the people of the world or even message brothers and the people of the world right because the generations get weaker but for the election the day shall be shortened amen amen and we find that the world is tripping in it's creeping into every home he's creeping to every household but what will make you difference is the Covenant yes yes the Covenant is not lying upon you amen God is Not relying upon you he's right upon what he already made the Covenant that he made amen amen and you have to accept that by faith amen yes your entire walk is my feet yes the Lord was having a shadow of things to come speaking about Grace which is a greater thing and which comes through the Royal seed and then we received Jesus Christ now we walk by faith amen we are living the fact that we are yeah they can believe this message purely by grace amen and right until we receive this word we was buried amen you believe that yes and because God will close the womb maybe he was in the denominations maybe he was in the Hindu World wherever you're going God had to close that spiritual room to ensure that no seed gets thrown in there amen he won't let what happened in the Garden of Eden happened to this elected right he found you you before the foundation of the world while Abraham was in Babylon he already knew that he had to bring him to the promised lands that was not the land for him yes before knew you he knew that no other seed could be planted in there yes yes that's why you were barren but there had to come a time of life amen because Sarah had to conceive at a specific time they had to be a visitation yes but before the conception there had to be a name change amen and you couldn't have the name change sitting in some denomination sitting in some organization amen amen you had to be obedient to the voice of God you have to come under thus said the Lord and when you come forth amen and then you began to conceive conception to place you began to receive of the word he said be not to me Lord according to Thy Word conception to place but she was buried before that and thank God you were barren because why if he wasn't buried it means you would have wrought for denomination you will denominational seed would have been sold in there Europe brought for denominational fruits but she was preserved because there was a covenant amen thank you amen you have to be preserved amen now God called a complete separation to separate himself from the rest of the world and from all of his people and from all of his Kindred there was a special thing for him to do and when God expects you to do a special thing he demand a complete separation from any doubts right this is the hour where we need to take God in his word yes amen this is our way we are so convinced Mary is so convinced by the scientific civilization that is very hard for man to have faith we're living in a hour that man is that men would rather believe what a doctor says what an intellectual intelligent people of the world tell them but let a spiritual man come there and give him the word of God you wouldn't want to accept it because because of him he wants to accept something with intellectual words yeah and that is why you find even in preaching even in a message if someone comes with an intellectual way of bringing the word people rather follow them even in the message people rather someone can explain the word what intellectualism someone can buy other scriptures someone can can give you the proper Greek pronunciation yeah I would rather have a man come at an inspiration of the Holy Ghost under the leadership of the Holy Ghost and under the anointing of God and preached under inspiration amen because what everyone does say the Lord amen amen amen if you are thoroughly convinced if you are converted if you receive the Holy Ghost and you come under the true anointing of the word of God because that's what the mess that's what the seven times come to do yes it comes to take you out of that sex body into the world body amen come you take you out of The reigns of the Mortal to the immortal that's what this word come to do come to make you change Dimension from here from the Earthly to the heavenly the prophet of God says and when God expected to a special things it demands a complete separation from any doubts if you've got any doubts you want to say God Demands a complete separation from any doubts Cast Away your doubts customer your your reasoning you're trusting God for something today Cast Away your doubts you're trusting God for finances passed away your anxiety and fear you've got to believe your God Amen you're going to believe you young people that's writing exams you're going into the example you got to recognize that you are different from every other student that's very like them you better recognize that you are a different species you come from a different lineage yes you are from the Royal Sea amen of Abraham amen when you are walking in an exam Hall with all the other students you are different from everyone else You are not alone you think you're going alone maybe it's time to tap into God's word and see that the angels of God are surrounding you maybe it's the time that we as spiritual leaders gonna tell the people Lord open their spiritual eyes let it be open that he could see that it was more for them than more than against them you're going for a job interview maybe it is one position and there's so many you know how it is to get a job now and there's so many people going out there with all the laws that they've got now for labor laws with the employment Equity act and so forth you are not an ordinary person going there for that interview yes there's something peculiar about you and them amen you are going to possess the gates of the enemy amen amen you're gonna take don't let an uncircumcised person come and take your inheritance amen yes you are not just an ordinary person you are a person you are people with a covenants amen you are circumcised our fun with the Holy Ghost thank you Jesus amen because why don't let the other people say Lord I did they fast and pray and get all the blessing they are enjoying those blessings because of you all the nations they are blessed to thy seed amen amen you trust in God for healing You've Got to Believe yes when you're asking for healing yes the same God that you're asking for healing created every organ in your body amen how can you make a doctor who studied about the body and got a limited knowledge in his study he never created organ did the doctor create the heart did he create all the things do they create every artery in your body no God created it so if God is saying You by my sight you are healed didn't take God and His word amen amen the doctor is saying your heart is true you need to do a bypass say Lord you created the last release unclog this the things that are causing the strugging amen yes take God at his words amen amen you're trusting God for the house do you know God bless Abraham he was blessed that even when he wanted a field so that he could bury Sarah's wife and the people offered it to him he would pay for it yes because he was blessed he said amen so if you want to ask God will provide you with that Finance to buy that house amen amen this is the god that we serve amen why amen this is the hour where we should claim what rightfully belongs to us and possess the gates of the enemy amen yes don't let the devil come and put doubt in you that's right don't let the devil put fear in you don't listen to the people don't mingle with the people of the world Amen amen the longer you meaning with the people of the world you know so doubting to you yes yes there was no descript the seed of discrepancy in you refuse to hear doubt hmm amen you are what you speak speak life you have the Word of Life in your mouth Yes amen Speak Life constant doubt Caster reasoning and when God expects you to do a special thing he Demands a complete separation from any doubt you've got to come to full obedience to obey what he says God demands it you can't do it no other way and now he always set an example and that was his example of a complete separation from all of his family all of his kingdoms and so forth to walk a life separated to God God called us from even from our Earthly family we love our entry families we want to be with them and we pray for them but we cannot be influenced by them amen amen we cannot take a theory that our family gives us how we should live our life maybe your employment is coming and criticizing your daughter for cutting the hair maybe your family is criticizing your wife going to church one way do not take the theories you are called for my total separation amen don't be ashamed of what you believe in right tell them that you are called into a message that will take you to the Rapture yes you are called a message that is taking you out from this ugly body to another body amen amen amen because why you are so jealous in this land like Abraham amen we are searching for another land now watch now nothing happened but still Abraham held on he was not discouraged he never staggered at the promises of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God year by year as it went by No Doubt many critics come by and said Abraham father of nation how many children do you have now he didn't stagger him only how many of you already in the message I've had this maybe a family that told you how many years are you talking about a Rapture how many years are you talking about the coming of the Lord but did you stag it no you went stronger amen you and you you your roots went deeper yes and you began to grow up more firmer in the world Amen more solid in the world more mature in the world you didn't stagger you began to become upright until now you began to speak and prophesy directly to them we have just saved the Lord and there's coming in our when there's going to be a resurrection that's coming in over when I'm gonna have a body change that's coming over with destruction is coming upon here but I'm gonna be gone amen amen amen oh remember when Noah was in the ark he didn't see before he goes into the heart he didn't see a sign of any dark clouds coming yes he didn't say a sign of lightning flashing no only when the doors were shut yes amen then the weather the atmosphere has began to change amen but he believed it by faith amen and he was obedient to God so year by year he went by No Doubt many critics come by the Abraham father of nation how many children do you have now that didn't stagger him no child in Sarah was passed the time of life or bearing children because Way Beyond menopause but still Abraham believed God just the same look at this now this is the step of Faith now he made preparation for the baby are you making preparation for the departure amen amen you're speaking about the Rapture but you're living like you stuck upon the Earth are you planning to depart but you you want to be EarthBound are you planning to depart but you want to build your kingdom upon the Earth how can you talk about being a Rapture but your life doesn't have just too many how about a Rapture when you stuck with all the people of the world every day you're stuck with all the problems you stuck with a little seeing issues why don't you speak like you're from above amen amen why don't you speak like you like you're hearing from another source because that's what you're hearing from amen because you are now seated in every places in Christ Jesus and if you've seen it in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus it means you are receiving from another source so he made preparation because he knew when it was fully persuaded that God could not make a promise that he wasn't big enough to back up you see to think the same thing regardless of how unreal it seems how unnatural it seems to the mind God cannot make a promise that he is not big enough to take care of Amen you worry about little things you worry about what food you can eat you worry about clothes you've been away you go you worry about your the future of your career and your job you think God is that big enough to take care of those things you think you you're serving a finite God you serving an infinite God rich in Mercy he said he is Jehovah China my provider he is able to open his window of heaven and pour out his blessings upon you and if he could feed the children of Israel in the wilderness here we could take care of Elijah in the cave maybe he could take care of that with a woman behind closed doors in the house oh no that is how much more he do for you you think God is not able to multiply that her so that wallet that you have um how many everyone ever took your word and literally prayed over you and said Lord let this wallet never run dry how have you had the faith to do that that's the type of thing we should be having it why are we limiting the god that we have with the same God looking at the Mount of Olives and he looked at the mountains there and he said if you say to this mountain be thou removed and plucked into the sea it shall be done did Jesus not say that he said how unnatural it is to the lesser man how foolish it is rather to the Natural mind it doesn't make a bullet difference if God said so that's it amen and here's the code here's what we're talking about this morning and the Seed of Abraham are settled upon thus said the Lord yes that settles it we find out at 25 years later no children and still God was faithful to keep his promise to Abraham for Abraham believed God the little boy came on the scene little Isaac so his message the prophet goes off to see in 1965. the message goes around the world but you ought to be an hour where does body have to be manifested amen that that food was stored up but they had to be an hour where this body of Christ will be manifested upon the Earth and when she raised up that supersede she will rise up to that soup to become that super Church because why she's always super race because she come to the Royal Sea very natural race a super race yes a supernatural people upon the Earth and to become an invincible army yes what makes it different from the rest of the world when Israel went out to battle I'm talking about the rightful King under the prophets under Moses under Joshua under David and the Solomon whenever Israel went out to battle what made Israel different from every other Army they added Covenant they put the word of God the Ark of the Covenant before them amen amen and they the the people of the world or the other nations even when the time when Joshua went to Jericho the people began to shake within themselves when the children of Israel and can't talk about them even though they had this powerful World they were shaking within themselves because they heard the testimonies yes said these people they don't just fight the battle on their own amen amen they have a god behind them yeah Hallelujah these people don't find a natural battle amen these people fight a supernatural battles hallelujah amen amen and the people began to shake and that's why you went there's a son and daughter of God when you begin to walk into any situation those demons must tremble amen those demons must know these people are not the Ordinary People yes they will not come in there the devil must know this people don't fight me on natural ground yes they won't come and fight with me all day on my term hey no these people are Supernatural people amen and they got a covenant Hallelujah you got the word going before them amen thank you Lord you see I told you you're going to be rejoicing this morning because you are not alone you've got to see the word before you yes amen you've got to see that not in this world alone the spiritual battle upon the Earth you are not even alone yes you are different from every other race upon your device amen thank you Lord amen now the little boy came on the scene little Isaac and after little Isaac had come on the scene then we find out that God giving a double test yes now this is where you are now gonna take the work or you're going to take it easy yes deep within you in your soul right there only one thinking lady either Faith or doubt amen now if you are the seed of God and supersede that means you come by faith Hallelujah you've got to have faith people will come and show you false in the message they will come and show you all the the twist everything but you wouldn't even have time to reason yes you won't even you wouldn't even give him a second thoughts you say sorry amen I see this thing from Genesis I see the entire picture now amen where I see the old thing made plain to me yes amen this is no longer a mystery amen amen amen there was a time when he was a mystery but now it's made plain yeah I'm the manifested word in this hour and now I'm here to possess the gates of the enemy amen thank you Lord thank you amen yes amen he says you know so you God put him on a double chest he said after being now with 115 years old or 20 Abraham was and he said I want you to take this your only son and take him up to the mountain you see everybody said your only son yes God only recognizes those in his Cosmos yes and God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son amen what world the cause mother no he's on Cosmos his own world those that were in his thoughts before the foundation of this world that's the world that God loves don't let everyone come and tell you no God loves everybody God loves his own amen yes God is not going to love the devil God is not going to love serpency he knows who they are you don't love this worldly world he loved these worlds his perfect world Amen then after he said your only son God when he recognize the seed amen and take him up to the mountain that I will show you and they offer him up on this mountain for a sacrifice in other words destroy every evidence that he had that the promise would be fulfilled that's taking away all the natural things you see God was showing in Ibraham how he was going to bless us amen he was showing how Jesus was going to come and now he was going to sacrifice his only begotten son for you and I amen that truly we might have life and have it more abundantly and through him to the Royal seed we will be blessed amen we will be a blessed people we will have a covenant we will have all the blessings of Gods and Abraham said I received him as one from the dead and I'm fully persuaded that he was able is able to raise him up from the dead amen Abraham was convinced that he wasn't going to kill him but he was also convinced that in my old age when I couldn't have children I was good at that said I was good as dead but we had a child God is able to raise him up amen if God can do that to us because remember before Isaac come the mysterious thing took place that no church world can tell you about it see no Theologian will tell you about yeah amen he took a profit yes to come in this day and show you the sign that you are now seeing upon the Earth Discerning the hearts of the people telling them who they are where they come from that sign was done one time in the Bible showing him brought them to the Adrian time he said that was the last Shrine before the destruction for them they showed it again in Son of Man Ministry this price but yeah he's showing it before the destruction of Sodom um foreign then she had to have a presentation the heart was designed and then they added body change amen amen yes it was a sign remember my day was the shadow and this is our way the people the people greater than the shadow amen upon the Earth if the Shadow and the people of the Shadow can be blessed how much I see men when they were given for example how much more the blessings of God upon us now amen so he says that I am fully persuaded that he is able to raise him up from the dead that's the people now the seed of Gabriel because he raised us from the Deads we were dead in sin that trespasses and the devil thought he could destroy this Royal seed every time God wants to bring forth to see the devil wants to destroy it in the time of Moses he did that before Adam could fly could speak the word and bring forth his reproduce after himself he went to Eve then before Moses comes on the scene because he already told Abraham that your people's in a journey there's a journey in a Strange Land but I will send him a deliverer so before the deliverer comes the team the devil does the Lord of scripture the devil wants to now come and destroy the sea but God revealed to Moses parents that he wasn't a normal child amen they had to have a visitation from the angel of God he showed that he was was cut out for a specific purpose and God preserved Moses for a Ministry he did the same thing when Jesus comes on the scene he wants to destroy that Royal seed amen but God preserved him amen and then he come and walked through the church ages try to destroy the seed but in every age God sent forth and messenger what a message to captivated seed and once they received that word they conceived he was no longer buried in an age they conceived in their age amen amen and they were kept away yes until in this day there was the people upon the Earth and God had to come in preserve us for his name's sake and we had one from the dead raised up again the spiritual body of Jesus Christ upon the Earth for two thousand years the world will never see the hand of God like you did until the days of the prophets they never beyond the prophet in this day they never saw all these things taking place all these people that went out with the healing revivals it was first the prophet they saw it in the prophet Ministry and that spearheaded the healing Revival it was his ministry that took off he never saw things taking place like this since Bible times yes and this now was done in math around the world this the prophet went around the world he began to see the supernatural God again God became God God was pulled out of History amen God became little God to the people because why he was manifesting God before the people and just like in the upper room when the disciples were there about 120 of them and the pull of fire separated himself among each of them into cloven tunnel of Fire and each one was enjoyed with power from an eye for service amen just like that to pull out fire now is moving amongst and many women dried amen because she's endured with power from an eye for service man amen so what the power of God can be manifested through our life amen that she can be walking on the earth drawing Garden of History again making God little to the people amen yes and when the people see you and they see God manifesting through you God is becoming tangible to them you see what what the responsibility there is upon the bride I just you can go to a person and Speak Life to them mm-hmm and that's the people down the seat of Abraham because he raised us from the dead we were dead in sins and trespasses and he was able to change my mind change my thoughts change my nature change me all over he can do as he pleases whatever he says I believe in the church and every Seed of Abraham believed the same thing amen amen Hebrews 11 8 by faith Abraham when he was called to God into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obey him and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he saw John in the land of promise and in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob you see this he was drowning with the Tabernacles in temporary places for he looked for a city which air Foundation whose building and making is gone amen through faith also Sarah a cell perceived strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past aged because she judged him faithful word promised amen therefore spring there even one even of one even as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as a sand which is by the sea show innumerable these all die in faith not having received the promise but having seen them afar off and we are persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of the country from whence they came out they might have an opportunity to have returned in other words Abraham could have returned back to where he came from but he was searching for this country for the city which had Foundation that's why he was just pitching of kids dwelling temporarily take his family and move take his family and move but one day he met the king of that City amen amen he met him when he met him that country became a reality to him amen and he knew that all of you see my Souljah must go to that City and he knew that when we come to his time of his death he's going to go to that City because he already met the king of that City amen amen and we had one in this day amen another one with a seven-letter word that go and visit the city this literal Place amen he literally went there amen and he goes he comes back and testifies amen this is the temporary joining place you are now in The Pastels but in my father's house amen there are many mansions there's Better Bodies amen there's another Immortal body waiting for you amen amen you are dying daily you are decaying daily but there is an eternal City there is a better body waiting for you a body that cannot corrupt a body that kind of age amen whoa I he said he saw the people in the prime of the youth amen we find that Abraham did the same thing and every child of God will do the same thing amen so what did you desire he said he civilian making his God a Heavenly country they are Desiring an immortal land amen we are designing any mortal land amen that's why you can't find yourself comfortable on the Earth right now like as the eagle stood up the nest you are becoming uncomfortable this world system that you are now dwelling in is becoming uncomfortable for you he will be if it's become comfortable for you and you're enjoying your life on your thing we are living a good life on the Earth it is something wrong with you amen foreign our Lord even now come Lord Jesus amen you can see now from 2019 we are telling the way to 2020. and we said the world is not going to be the same and the world we can see it as a different Junction of time you can see now that we're turning now to a different Corner amen yes you can you can't go back to what you want you can see it even unbelievers can see that something is different upon the Earth you can see the world governments how they changed it overnight you can see you can see the politics you can see even in Israel they got a new uh Benjamin Netanyahu is back now in power and you can see in Britain what happened you can see in other nations what happened you can see even in USA when the Republicans become empowered this guy fighting might not even know if he's going to be impeached so a lot of things are taking place right now that's right because why this Kingdom of this world must crumble that's right but he's also getting the state is also being set for the Antichrist system to take complete control of the Earth so if all is he's taking place and if Satan is moving in his time slot and moving fast how much more the bride should be moving in daytime amen how much more relevant we should be in the tower yes amen amen instead of worrying about what Satan is doing and he is in his Eden let's concentrate on what we should be doing in our purpose our purpose is searching for that City whose building and making God our purpose is to make the Rapture so we should be conditioning ourselves to make the Rapture amen amen amen we should be in a lecturing condition amen we should be a mature Church working upon the Earth we should be a church that know what our promises are a church that know whatever inhabitants are [Music] and a church that can declare plainly our promises declare plainly who our God is plainly what are God has done for us yes that's what the seals come to do that's what the seventh time has awakened you do call you a pretty little liar every age you'll bring up higher higher higher until in this stage amen you got into the inner whale Amen in this stage you got into the holy of holies into the secret Chambers amen and you come now you are sealed away into Christ you are so locked up into Christ that in the midst of this little CNA in the midst of grass Darkness you can keep the word amen because why you have given an overcoming power in this age amen you're flying above all the foods flying above all the demon powers that are filtrated the entire world right now because this world right now demon Spirits upon the Earth demon Spirits are powering upon mankind but the also aware that you are here they say these people here they don't fight the battles themselves yeah they know they go Hallelujah they have a covenants they have the word the word for them and if we go faces people we have to face the ark which is the Covenant the word of God amen and they can't come to the word amen so you need to be fortified by the word amen you do you don't step out on the Satan's territory that's how Satan wants to fight you he wants you to he what he does is he brings us Temptations they bring all his device all his tactics yes he wants you to step out into his territory that is why you're going through a situation maybe you've got a problem at your workplace the devil wants you to lose your temper and he wants you to walk into his territory and handle it in the flesh you step behind closed door go in your closet go in the bathroom at work and say Lord Satan I recognize what you are doing you are trying to let me come into your territory I am a person I'm a Child of God I have a covenant and now I command you in the name of Jesus Amen you get thee behind me Satan amen the blood of Jesus be against you yes and his blood covers me Hallelujah that's how you defeat the enemy you are a supernatural people you are fighting a spiritual battle yes yes do not find a natural battle um I can speak of so many testimonies that there are certain things that we're trusting God for we are feeling in the flesh until we pray and we just left you to God and God came through for us amen and brother he didn't know about the specific thing that we're talking about what I'm talking about now there's a certain things we are trusting God for and everything was failing Us in the flesh when we tried our natural ways of greetings but when we trusted God and we just left you to God he just came through for us amen and you should do that all the time yes Amen in every circumstances and everything that you have need of trust God all the time amen and if you're asking God to do something don't interfere with it yes leave it to God because why your people will just say the Lord amen amen Romans 12 2 and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that day may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God don't conform to his work don't follow the words in don't let the world influence you be a be a person on your own make your make your decisions pray for me yes right you want to choose a partner in life pray about it you want to truly clear pray about it don't even be influenced by your family don't be influenced by anybody pray about it because ask God what he designed you for amen you are here every one of us we put you up for your purpose right right and God got a plan for each of Our Lives each one of us are unique I cannot be like brother Ramesh but Ramesh cannot be like me we are unique our characters are unique yes so God called me for a specific purpose God called you for his specific purpose ask God what he called you for yes and God will reveal it to you amen so let us go forth beyond the camp amen let's go beyond the camp I don't look what I'm saying is look at things with our spiritual life this is our way we should walk with our spiritual eyes open amen because you're working with people that are influenced by demon Spirits you are you are associating every day with people that are influenced by the devil you realize that if you believe that those demons are upon the Earth manifested him because the demon the only time the demon can be manifested is through a body they have to work through a body amen and if they are working through a body we are associating with them right so you've got your discern the spirit yes amen you've got to have discernment in this hour and how are you going to have a discernment if you've got a life that you don't separate yourself with God if you haven't come up Ayah and locked away into the inner Veil where you are in the presence of God Alone if you don't have God walking with you amen if you don't have a personal relationship with God then you are walking in the flesh yes right because this is our way should be circumcised you should be half the Holy Ghost we shall be led by the spirit of God they that the sons of God are led by the spirit of God Amen amen you know I think we had this meeting that the brother was preaching here that that night and the anointing was so strong and the next morning I was at work and somebody came to me and they came in a distressed boy I just said this is deserving the person of distress and they're giving me the story this lost their mother and now as soon as the mother died the daughter was in a coma because the daughter was so used to the mother and she was also a doctor and she ended up in a coma in Johannesburg and he was stressed understood and he just give me so I said no let's stop talking now I said now you need God there's only one person that can intervene I stopped him I didn't want to listen to anything more negative and I just began to pray the next time I met him he told me no his daughter is fine she's not a diploma there's nothing that I did but I'm talking about just giving heed to that position that you have being conscious of that at that time when God has asked me to do something do it when God wants you to do something do it I should go pray some other time yeah or I'll leave for another time in that moment when God wants to do something do it amen to what the spirit is telling you at that time be led by the spirit of God and I just held his end and I prayed and I left the God so next time I met him when you're telling me in the testimony and mind you this is the person can almost believe the message because his old church or half of the church ends up in the message and he was the one that left behind but I even took him to the voice of Her Library the first time when I went to the voice of my library I took him with me so it was an opportunity for him to see and the way the power of God is now with the children of God Amen that believe this message amen now that's not for me to see but that godmother could have had that opportunity for him to witness that God is working in this message amen amen because why we don't serve a god of History amen amen the message didn't stop it or the healings and all didn't stop in the days of William Brennan the same God of William Branham is here today amen amen because we have believed this message of William Branham yes yes and we have accepted him as the prophet of birth yes we accepted him that God used him and even God will use that redeemed body to manifest himself Amen in Son of Man Ministry amen yeah nobody walked in this day and their comfort walked amen nobody can come and testify we have even signs picturing taking picture of the pool of Fire science can even testify of that yes but yet the people rejected they're so random but Kelly it's hard to Fathom now that you believe it because it's revealed to you if not to fed them how people have seen the supernatural they've seen paradoxes I mean people without eyeballs receiving eyes they didn't even have those eye sockets but they received iron whatever color they wanted they've seen the dead rails they've seen a person that will speak to the storm out of existence things like that the pillar of fire there in the meetings people pronounce to be with cancer mom was about to die and then come with healing just too many years they've seen all that people that he never saw before he could discern the hearts tell them where they come from tell them what they did one one after the other and there after the false prophets went for it impersonators because first came Moses then came jealous in Germany amen first they must be the original amen and therefore even in this hour many are talking about the coming of the Lord Antichrist Holy Spirit but you only have the true way amen you have the true secret yes the secret yes the love tree is not meant for everybody yes yes we preaching hoping that many will be saved trying to save people from hell because we know that there's many of us seen coming out of the tribulation but the reaction is not meant for everybody yes and for a special class of people it's for people with a Covenants it's for people that are so Journey there are pilgrims upon the Earth that are searching for a land amen searching for a city amen whose Builder and maker is God yes people at study for the city but a sure Foundation one with an absolute while the people of the world wants to rejoice in this city they come from the one on the bottom of the spirit amen one without Foundation amen you glad today and you are not an Ordinary People upon the Earth and God was showing there to Abraham the two is seed that God himself would become flesh and then have to be separated at Calgary where Christ being God and us he was separated throw him apart the Royal seat of Abraham and took the life out of him and raised up the body up to sit on his throne in heaven and send back the spirit of him upon the church that the church has to have the same Spirit was in Christ to make it come together making Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen confirmation of the Covenant amen God confirming the covenants yes God separating tearing the light from Christ his son taking the spirit of him as he cut his animals into standing between animals the light God himself went between them showing them he separated the body the seed the Royal seed and took the spirit and sent it back upon the church amen and the Church of God today that goes to be Christ will have to have the same spirits that he had because he will because it cause it will have to be letter by letter word by word and hear the word Jesus said he that believes in me the words that I do shall he do also confirming the Covenant so let me tell you something God wants to confirm his Covenants you take God in his word no matter what your situation is God wants to prove his word yes and confirm that he's with you amen that he hasn't left you when the prophet left the scene he wants to show you that he's here with you amen he got healed when the prophet said you are healed go and testify he had to go and justify even before the manifestation took place amen go and be a testimony if you want a job testify about your job before you get the job amen say the Lord give it to give me this job the Lord is going to bless me with this job amen go and testify about your healing before you'll see her before you see it manifested amen because that is faith faith is a substance of thing hopeful the evidence of things not seen in other words it's already a substance it's already tangible it's something hopeful it's already there in the Supernatural it only needs to materialize in the natural what will bring it in the natural your confession amen your belief what your doubt can take it away but your belief your faith can bring it to materialize amen so let's start confessing it amen yes the things that you have need of confessing by faith amen and it will materialize that what you ask for shall materialize because God wants to confirm his Covenants and God is doing that right now he's got a People upon the Earth who can take him and believe every word line upon line precept upon precept because why they come up a little higher and they're changing from Glory unto Glory until one of these days all these mortal bodies amen is going to put on immortality there's going to be a people on the Earth that's walking the same was that enough works we you're not work with God because he believed God's word you are working with God because you are working with God's word you are believing every word of God Amen you are becoming that word every day as you walk and so you are walking with God and if you are walking that walk amen I need to bring you to the stature of a perfect man and he's bringing it with our manifesting his word in one of these days it must give you that body change it must bring to fulfillment all these promises amen one of these days you must be a resurrection yes one of these days while you're here you must change Dimensions you must lead this Dimension to another dimension bring right to the seventh dimension because what is going to be a wedding supper Hallelujah that's the promise amen and then everything that the world is rejoicing this temporal world the world is not even a fit for you it wasn't a foot for them it wasn't food for Abraham Isaac Jacob and all his Patriarchs he wasn't put for the apostles he's not put for you either it wasn't football William Branham he's not good for you in this world but God will make it a good place God is going to renovate it he's going to make it a good place for you to dwell in [Music] amen amen that this world wasn't a foot place for them it's not a place for you but he will make it a good place for you to dwell in amen amen he says we've had a

received a covenant amen he said the last sign that Abraham with the Covenant the Lost sign before rejection of the lukewarm church and the destruction was a sign of perceiving the thoughts in the art in the mind of God manifested in human flesh we had that already amen that history now yeah amen so where are we now amen we are about this world now cannot take it any longer this world is about to
