[0:01] can you get it
[0:03] amen wherefore if God so close the grass
[0:06] of the field which today is and tomorrow
[0:08] is cast into the oven shall he not much
[0:11] more clothe you oh he of little
[0:15] faith therefore take no thought saying
[0:19] what shall we eat or what shall we drink
[0:22] or where with All Shall we be clothe for
[0:25] after all these things do the Gentile
[0:28] seek you see people who don't know
[0:31] God for your heavenly father knoweth
[0:35] that you have need of all these things
[0:37] amen amen amen yes but seek ye first the
[0:40] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[0:43] all these things shall be added unto you
[0:45] amen amen therefore take no thought for
[0:49] tomor for the morrow for the morrow
[0:51] shall take thought for the things of
[0:53] itself sufficient unto the day is the
[0:56] evil thereof amen may the Lord have
[0:58] blessings to the reading of his word you
[0:59] may be SE
[1:02] seated amen praise the
[1:06] lord we find here that our lord Jesus is
[1:08] teaching us about how we can take care
[1:10] of the body you know when we come across
[1:14] things that are affecting our body we
[1:16] can very easily change
[1:18] diets change exercise programs do
[1:22] everything for the body but that is not
[1:26] the real us amen so we C to for the body
[1:31] and if a doctor gives us an alarming
[1:32] report we will do everything we can to
[1:34] follow the advice being given to us but
[1:37] yet within us is a spirit man amen the
[1:41] spirit man is much more important than
[1:45] the flesh man amen because it is from
[1:48] the spirit that we are controlled people
[1:51] don't realize it because we are not
[1:53] taught these things from birth we are
[1:55] not thought that we are a spirit being
[1:57] living in a flesh body and that one day
[2:00] the flesh body will die but the spirit
[2:02] will go to a new body we are not taught
[2:04] those things amen we may come to the
[2:07] knowledge of the truth years later but
[2:09] remember it's got to come with
[2:11] reconditioning because everything in
[2:13] your existence everything you learned
[2:15] was to cater for the five senses yes yes
[2:19] amen now we know that we have seven
[2:21] senses
[2:23] right how many if you know we got seven
[2:25] senses amen the prophet says we got
[2:28] seven senses we got five sens you know
[2:30] your you know what they are see taste
[2:32] feel smell here then we got the six
[2:34] sense Faith amen right and then the
[2:37] prophet says there's also another sense
[2:39] which is opposite of Faith which is
[2:42] fear the sense of
[2:45] fear so you can either choose to operate
[2:48] by faith or by
[2:50] fear so we see that the Lord is telling
[2:52] us you're cing so much for the flesh man
[2:55] but there is no investment in the flesh
[2:58] man there is no reward from investing in
[3:01] the flesh man so Jesus is inviting us
[3:04] and he's telling us come and seek the
[3:06] kingdom of God amen amen it's a gentle
[3:10] invitation into the kingdom and the
[3:14] invitation is telling you that in the
[3:16] Kingdom there's going to be No Lack it's
[3:18] going to open the doors to the and open
[3:20] the windows of Heaven amen amen amen
[3:24] hallelujah amen hallelujah but Jesus is
[3:27] a good fisherman because Jesus said I
[3:30] will make you fishes of men am amen amen
[3:34] amen because I want you to know that
[3:36] even as brother brand tells us the
[3:38] Christian Life Is No Bed of
[3:41] Roses so the invitation is
[3:44] come I'm going to take care of you don't
[3:47] worry what you're going to eat drink
[3:50] what you're going to have
[3:53] amen but if we go to Matthew
[3:57] 1112 so with that that kind of an
[4:00] invitation wouldn't anybody want to come
[4:03] everybody will want to come because it's
[4:05] a lovely beautiful
[4:08] invitation amen now let's see what Jesus
[4:13] tells us about the kingdom even further
[4:17] from Matthew 11 and:
[4:20] 12 and from the days of John the Baptist
[4:23] until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffer
[4:25] with
[4:28] violence
[4:31] so let me ask you Kingdom of the Earth
[4:33] can be seen physical eyes yes Kingdom of
[4:36] Heaven can be seen no because must be
[4:39] seen with spiritual eyes so Jesus is now
[4:43] giving us a glimpse into the spiritual
[4:45] Kingdom and he's telling us you're
[4:48] coming into the kingdom but this Kingdom
[4:50] suffered
[4:53] violence
[4:56] amen and the violent take it by force
[5:04] amen so when you're coming you got to be
[5:07] prepared for war amen I'm going to say
[5:11] what the prophet says again the
[5:12] Christian Life Is No Bed of Roses he
[5:15] says we're not here on a picnic God is
[5:17] looking for soldiers train soldiers
[5:19] rugged
[5:21] soldiers amen amen amen for all the
[5:25] prophets and the laws prophesied un John
[5:29] amen and if you will receive it this is
[5:31] the LI which was for to come he that ad
[5:34] hears let him
[5:38] hear amen
[5:41] so the thought came to
[5:44] me because we find that on the 10th
[5:46] month of the seventh day in
[5:48] 2023 there was an unforeseen t on
[5:51] natural
[5:52] Israel but we know that the natural
[5:55] types are
[5:56] spiritual yes amen
[6:00] amen amen amen what you're seeing going
[6:03] on in the natural is a type of spiritual
[6:06] what's going
[6:07] on if we had to sit back and and observe
[6:11] what is going on in spiritual
[6:13] Israel you will find that people when
[6:16] I'm saying spiritual Israel you know
[6:18] exactly who I'm talking
[6:19] about there is only one true spiritual
[6:22] Israel amen the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[6:26] Christ but if we sit back people are
[6:29] relaxed
[6:31] people are
[6:33] comfortable people have intertwined the
[6:36] two lives together the Earthly and the
[6:39] spiritual and sometimes it seems that
[6:41] the Earthly has overshadowed and
[6:44] overpowered the spiritual that people
[6:47] can live defeated lives and continue
[6:49] with just having a knowledge that I'm in
[6:51] the message and I'm
[6:54] safe what happens is there's Philistine
[6:58] Nation that is camping in Israel and has
[7:02] got a
[7:05] stronghold and that from time to time
[7:08] you'll hear through the years they keep
[7:10] launching attacks yeah but is it from
[7:12] another
[7:13] city it's from within the walls of
[7:16] Israel the god-given
[7:19] land
[7:21] amen so there on the 10 month the
[7:24] seventh
[7:25] day you know there was an attack 5,000
[7:28] Rockets were launched at Jerusalem
[7:31] taking them una
[7:32] ways amen if a trumpet gives an
[7:35] uncertain sound who can prepare for war
[7:38] now if you go and research it this you
[7:40] won't find probably in the mainstream
[7:42] media because you know the mainstream
[7:44] media is controlled by the
[7:46] Jews how many of you know that Wall
[7:48] Street is owned by the Jews amen
[7:52] hallelujah what was happening that led
[7:55] to the
[7:57] violence is that this MOS
[8:01] you know the
[8:02] mosque ala mosque I think it's called
[8:06] which is Temple Mount yes so it was the
[8:09] week of the
[8:11] Passover they call it
[8:13] sukot what I'm trying to show you there
[8:16] were Jews that were
[8:17] arising and was wanting to enter that
[8:21] Temple to offer
[8:26] sacrifice and the Palestinians were not
[8:29] happy because they call it desecration
[8:31] of their
[8:33] mosque and even within the Jewish laws
[8:36] you know that an ordinary person is not
[8:40] allowed to go in the
[8:41] temple there's different
[8:45] courts but this why I'm showing you
[8:47] there's a group of people that are so
[8:49] zealous for true
[8:52] worship that's natural Israel
[8:55] now amen and they want to go and Ed by
[9:01] force so the Israel army had to get
[9:04] involved and in order to stop it they
[9:07] also had to stop the
[9:09] Palestinians from going into the into
[9:12] their MOS to
[9:13] worship so because of the Restriction
[9:16] they call it the desecration of al- AA
[9:19] mosque and that is why they launched the
[9:24] attack that is the actual reason why
[9:26] they launched the
[9:28] attack
[9:30] what was it a people raising up in
[9:33] Israel who wants true worship to be
[9:36] restored now in the in the in the
[9:39] spiritual world is there a group of
[9:41] people restoring back to true worship is
[9:44] there a group raising up
[9:46] amen amen that is tired of just religion
[9:49] amen tired of just going to the Western
[9:52] Wall yes and praying amen he's Desiring
[9:56] Amen to now they want to go into a
[9:58] physical Temple we are saying Lord come
[10:00] into this
[10:02] Temple amen
[10:05] amen amen but we know that they are
[10:08] controlled by politics so then now they
[10:10] got the government involved and the Army
[10:12] involved I am saying that in this
[10:14] kingdom of
[10:16] God we have got to take it by force
[10:20] amen that's right how many times we
[10:22] heard the prophet say the Holy Ghost is
[10:23] a gentleman amen amen but the Holy Ghost
[10:27] is the one that turns up super
[10:31] takes us from natural to
[10:33] Supernatural but he's waiting for an
[10:35] invitation from you and
[10:37] me just waiting for that invitation
[10:40] waiting for us to get rid of all
[10:42] internal
[10:43] strongholds internal
[10:45] unbelief amen so we find here that Gaza
[10:49] was fell to Israelite rule amen and
[10:52] under King David in the 11th century
[10:55] King David was ruling this entire area
[10:58] it was all part of Israel but when when
[11:01] the when you know the the kingdom split
[11:04] between amen split between
[11:08] Israel and Judea Judah right so the
[11:11] northern kingdom and the southern
[11:13] Kingdom that's when Gaza became part of
[11:15] the Northern Kingdom of Israel amen so
[11:19] we find it's a it's a strip of land 41
[11:21] kilomet and 10 kilm wide so you know
[11:23] it's not a very big piece of land 41 by
[11:27] 10 located in
[11:30] Israel and we find that Gaza was
[11:33] captured in the sixth day
[11:36] war Israel withdrew its troops around
[11:38] 7,000 settlers in
[11:41] 2005 and then you know they kept having
[11:44] peace treaties peace treaties peace
[11:45] treaties in one of these things they
[11:48] then ended it
[11:49] over in 19 between 94 and 99 they
[11:53] transferred security and civilian
[11:55] responsibility for the Gaza Strip and
[11:57] the West Bank to the Palestinian in
[11:59] Authority now who is the
[12:02] Palestinians they are
[12:06] Philistines so the Philistines have
[12:08] always plagued
[12:10] Israel and because they never took care
[12:13] of them back then they are still here
[12:15] today yes you remember how God dealt
[12:19] with Saul because he refused to slay
[12:21] utterly slay and destroy the Kings the
[12:24] women the children
[12:27] yes
[12:29] amen
[12:31] now what does Gaza
[12:34] mean Gaza means strong
[12:38] City Gaza means strong City so there's a
[12:42] stronghold in the midst of
[12:44] Israel that now they can't get rid of
[12:47] now the entire world's attention is on
[12:50] Israel and even though there is a
[12:52] support they are also restrained from
[12:55] doing certain things so they cannot
[12:58] utterly slay and
[13:01] destroy the approach has to be
[13:06] measured
[13:12] amen amas means you know amas is the
[13:16] group that is now the militant group
[13:18] what does amas mean
[13:22] violence so they have a stronghold in
[13:25] Israel that's operating with violence
[13:28] yes
[13:30] do you know what they want they really
[13:32] want
[13:33] Jerusalem so in the natural the Kingdom
[13:36] of Israel is suffering violence and the
[13:39] violence wants to take it by
[13:41] force amen
[13:44] amen
[13:47] am but here we are spiritual Israel want
[13:51] to sit and eat
[13:53] peanuts us Lord while the flashing red
[13:55] light of his
[13:57] coming

[14:03] we are not waiting for the coming of the
[14:04] lord we are in the cycle of the coming
[14:07] of the lord The Rapture already started

[16:12] theology because people are fallen
[16:14] asleep and they haven't really caught
[16:17] the mystery of the second coming amen
[16:20] amen they have a denominational concept
[16:23] of the second coming thinking that one
[16:25] day the sky is going to split open and

[27:24] changing
[27:26] amen and you shall be
[27:29] Witnesses amen amen yes you shall be
[27:32] Witnesses now amen yes you see let me
[27:36] explain what kind of people you
[27:39] are you never saw one physical evidence
[27:41] of the Lord Jesus Christ you yet to
[27:43] believe in him amen you never saw him
[27:46] take the cross you never saw him die you
[27:49] never saw him raise
[27:51] again but you believe in it what is that
[27:54] called
[27:55] Faith now if you can believe believe God
[27:58] like that you believe on the Lord Jesus
[28:00] Christ whom you haven't
[28:01] seen you haven't touched you've nothing
[28:05] You' saw nothing with the physical
[28:07] senses but you're believing by faith

[28:11] with others aspects you never saw
[28:13] William
[28:15] Brandon amen you never heard him

[28:21] faith
[28:23] amen this is the caliber of people you
[28:25] are amen amen why you come back from a
[28:28] faith civilization amen amen praise the
[28:31] Lord yes
[28:33] Lord hallelujah thank so the Bible says
[28:36] that we come from God and we go back to
[28:38] God right how where did we come from but
[28:41] watch there a progression we come from
[28:44] the thoughts of
[28:47] God but we can't go back to his thoughts
[28:51] we already expressed when we leave this
[28:53] life we don't become a thought again
[28:56] amen we go back into aor glorified State
[28:59] we go back into a better State amen what
[29:01] is better a thought or the thing
[29:05] manifested so we're coming into the
[29:07] manifested word amen hallelujah this
[29:10] thing is going to Climax and I'm telling
[29:11] you it's climaxing but we need to shake
[29:14] ourselves strong amen don't allow
[29:16] strongholds to
[29:17] exist amen hallelujah so Jesus
[29:20] manifested the power so in the kingdom
[29:23] of God now is not only going to take
[29:25] care of your daily needs the king of God
[29:27] comes with power amen amen amen yes he's
[29:32] telling you that the kingdom of God is
[29:33] suffering violence so he's got to give
[29:36] you a power to counter the violence amen
[29:40] yes amen so Jesus manifested the power
[29:44] of the
[29:45] Kingdom with tangible signs tangible
[29:50] Miracles things that you could
[29:52] see amen they stood there in amazement
[29:55] because people that were born blind
[29:57] Jesus gave them back their sight amen
[30:00] people that couldn't walk from birth
[30:02] Jesus made them walk again what is that
[30:05] operating from the kingdom of God that
[30:07] was within him amen and you as a son and
[30:10] daughter of God can operate the same way
[30:12] if we get rid of
[30:15] strongholds there is something stopping
[30:17] you from operating to your true
[30:19] potential and those things are called
[30:22] strongholds because we don't want to lay
[30:24] down those strongholds amen yes help us
[30:28] that's right and only you and I will
[30:30] know what that stronghold is that's
[30:32] right only you will you and I will know
[30:35] where we are not allowing the Lord in
[30:37] yes amen only you and I yes
[30:41] amen amen so the Lord here I'm showing
[30:45] you now that the kingdom of God comes
[30:48] not with observation but it comes with
[30:50] such tremendous power that people can't
[30:52] help but see the power
[30:55] amen and even though the king om of God
[30:57] cannot be seen with natural eyes the
[31:00] power can be seen with natural
[31:03] eyes because here has a man born blind
[31:06] with naturalized people can see now this
[31:08] man we know him he couldn't see now he
[31:10] can see this man couldn't walk now he
[31:12] can walk this man is laying dead 4 days
[31:16] we are the best funeral service for
[31:20] him amen We buried him we Ed him we put
[31:24] him in this
[31:26] tomb Undertakers have come and
[31:30] gone but this man is called back to life
[31:34] do you know that was one of the final
[31:36] things that the Jews couldn't handle you
[31:39] go read the Bible about Lazarus that
[31:42] they couldn't handle people were being
[31:43] converted because here was a living
[31:45] being a living man was dead 4 days and
[31:49] people were coming into the gospel in
[31:51] the Kingdom that the Pharisees the
[31:53] scribes and everybody they couldn't
[31:54] handle it they said we've got to put him
[31:56] to death
[31:58] they even wanted to kill
[32:03] Lazarus now what what a resurrection
[32:05] that was and what a resurrection this is
[32:08] the reason I'm telling you that because
[32:10] when you are coming to life now when you
[32:13] are being resurrected from dead
[32:15] denominationalism dead message theology
[32:17] amen forgive me for saying that but when
[32:19] you are being resurrected now people are
[32:22] not going to be happy and they'll want
[32:23] to put you to death they'll want to
[32:26] silence you
[32:27] they want to kill your testimony they
[32:29] want to kill your influence amen but
[32:32] don't be amen don't be overtaken by them
[32:35] amen overcome all these strongholds
[32:37] you've got to overcome these criticisms
[32:39] Amen in order to get into the all of
[32:41] Fame you've got to go through the all of
[32:44] critics but while you're going through
[32:46] the all of critics don't be deterred
[32:48] amen just know that you are Marching
[32:50] according to on with Christian Soldiers
[32:52] you are Marching according to the plan
[32:54] of God you are not sure to please men
[32:57] the father gives the instruction and I
[32:59] carry them out I'm not here to please
[33:02] man I'm here to please my
[33:05] Goden amen amen
[33:09] hallelujah amen
[33:11] hallelujah so each time amen that Jesus
[33:15] announced the good news of the Kingdom
[33:17] there was physical
[33:19] manifestation of sins being forgiven
[33:21] sicknesses being healed demons cast out
[33:24] feeding the hungry
[33:27] and death couldn't hold them down when
[33:30] Jesus was in
[33:33] attendance I'm going to say this again
[33:35] amen that when the kingdom of God is
[33:38] preached there is physical signs and
[33:40] wonders yes amen hallelujah amen so we
[33:45] can't present the kingdom of God and not
[33:48] have the same manifestation amen because
[33:51] I want to remind you of the one who was
[33:54] operating in this realm and this
[33:55] Authority was telling you and I that
[33:58] Greater Works than these shall he do
[34:00] amen for I go unto my father
[34:05] amen yes Lord
[34:08] amen now to the outside world it
[34:12] remained a secret how Jesus was
[34:14] operating with this Authority that's why
[34:16] they kept coming to
[34:18] him but to the people that were a part
[34:21] of the kingdom and to you it is given to
[34:24] know the mysteries of the kingdom and to
[34:26] us
[34:27] it's not a
[34:29] mystery because all the Mysteries have
[34:32] been
[34:33] revealed amen all the Mysteries have
[34:36] been revealed under Revelation 10:7 so
[34:39] that we can Now operate in the Kingdom
[34:42] amen amen praise the Lord let's switch
[34:46] amen glory be to his name amen glory to
[34:50] his name yes Lord glory to his
[34:55] name there my heart was the blood
[35:00] applied
[35:02] glory to his
[35:05] name glory to his
[35:10] name glory to his
[35:15] name there to my heart was the
[35:23] blood
[35:24] glory to to his name one more time Glory
[35:30] Singing
[35:31] Glory to his
[35:35] name
[35:37] glory to his
[35:40] [Music]
[35:42] name to my heart was the
[35:48] blood singing
[35:51] glor to his
[35:55] name
[35:57] amen praise the
[36:04] Lord amen
[36:25] hallelujah
[36:30] so to
[36:33] recap what we are talking about is
[36:35] exactly what Paul preached amen even
[36:40] though we are in the days of Jesus and
[36:42] we're showing you how Jesus
[36:43] operated and he was presenting the
[36:46] kingdom but Paul says I not come in word
[36:49] only
[36:51] amen because the gospel preached is the
[36:55] kingdom of God being preached
[36:58] amen amen but the kingdom of God must
[37:01] come with power and demonstration amen
[37:04] yes if the kingdom of if the kingdom is
[37:06] being preached without power and
[37:09] demonstration then it's being preached
[37:11] from an intellectual
[37:14] standpoint the kingdom of God cannot be
[37:17] preached with mechanics
[37:22] only amen amen
[37:25] hallelujah are you saying we have turned
[37:27] the corner
[37:28] yes yes amen are you saying you're not
[37:31] satisfied with the mechanics
[37:35] no are you saying we need both mechanics
[37:38] and Dynamics yes
[37:40] amen thank you Lord amen so you're
[37:43] saying I can't be a casual observer in
[37:44] the message of the hour
[37:46] no you mean the time of gathering
[37:49] information and and understanding all
[37:51] the Mysteries are over
[37:53] yes how long you want to be
[37:55] schooled yes amen you know what a test
[37:58] is a test is to check what you have
[38:02] learned and to move you to the next
[38:05] level to promote you to the next grade
[38:12] amen
[38:17] amen so people amen they get excited
[38:20] about the
[38:21] Revelation but the Revelation comes to
[38:23] give you a
[38:25] faith yes
[38:27] any Revelation must come to give you
[38:29] Faith yes amen amen because faith is a
[38:33] revelation right so here we find in
[38:37] in I I ended with this thought there
[38:40] while when the lights went off that the
[38:42] people outside can't understand the
[38:44] mystery of how you can operate in your
[38:47] sunship Authority and then when you
[38:49] speak yes amen amen yes amen the
[38:55] mountain can move amen
[38:57] but when they speak nothing
[39:00] happens amen so to the Insiders it's not
[39:05] a
[39:06] mystery but to the outside it's a
[39:09] secret amen because didn't he say that
[39:13] the third pool won't be a public
[39:15] show yes
[39:19] amen this ministry of the Bride won't be
[39:24] for the public yes amen so Romans 47
[39:28] Romans 14:17 says the kingdom of God is
[39:32] not a matter of eating and
[39:34] drinking but of righteousness peace and
[39:37] joy in the Holy Spirit in the Holy Ghost
[39:41] amen
[39:42] amen because anyone who serves Christ in
[39:45] this way is pleasing to God and receives
[39:48] of the Lords amen amen he's getting the
[39:52] Lord's favor what is needed Holy Spirit
[39:57] amen you you talk about this Holy Spirit
[39:59] that's so
[40:00] demanding you talk about the holy spirit
[40:03] that that just changes everything about
[40:06] me the
[40:08] holy you can't be the same way with the
[40:11] holy spirit
[40:15] amen if you invite the Holy Spirit into
[40:18] your life expect your life to be
[40:20] transform
[40:22] Amen to totally change yes amen
[40:28] you're going to you can't help because
[40:30] the holy spirit is love you can't help
[40:32] but love everybody yes you can't help
[40:35] but forgive everybody amen no matter how
[40:37] much they trample you the Holy Spirit
[40:39] kills the old nature gives you a new
[40:41] birth now he says the prophet says if
[40:44] you want to know if somebody's Dead with
[40:45] all nature what you got to
[40:48] do what you want to do tram their toes
[40:52] yes that's what he said right tram their
[40:54] toes and see how they react because he
[40:55] says that dead man how many of you went
[40:58] to the coffin and pinched the dead man
[41:01] then does he react no
[41:05] dead so the old nature must totally die
[41:08] please he I don't want to be attacked
[41:09] outside
[41:11] there amen praise the
[41:14] Lord whole man must completely die now
[41:17] you see there's there's many strongholds
[41:19] in our life it's not only that not only
[41:23] forgiveness and love but there's other
[41:27] things strongholds of
[41:30] bitterness that I say with my mouth that
[41:33] I love this person I say with my mouth
[41:35] that I forgive this person but there's
[41:36] that inside there there's still that
[41:38] feeling something is
[41:41] wrong something is wrong Holy Spirit now
[41:45] wants to go there and cleanse
[41:47] that Holy Spirit wants your time amen
[41:50] Holy Spirit wants your attention Holy
[41:53] Spirit wants you to make you operate
[41:54] like Jesus Christ amen
[41:58] I do nothing but what the father shows
[42:01] me
[42:03] amen so the kingdom of God is within you
[42:06] and is the holy spirit because the
[42:09] kingdom of God the Holy Spirit Will
[42:10] govern you and if you maybe you're
[42:13] wondering hey how do I behave you know
[42:15] if you go into a king's Palace what what
[42:17] is the protocol how do I behave how do I
[42:19] conduct myself in the king's Palace amen
[42:23] you don't have to worry about all that
[42:24] get the Holy Spirit amen amen and you
[42:27] don't have to guess whether you got the
[42:28] Holy Spirit anybody who's at a new birth
[42:31] anybody who's preparing to give birth
[42:33] will know about
[42:35] it
[42:37] amen
[42:39] amen there must be a time and an
[42:41] experience that you can relate to and
[42:42] point to amen yes this was the day I
[42:47] died and I was born
[42:50] again amen people say I've been born

[43:22] amen but the kingdom of God is suffering
[43:25] violence amen there's an there spiritual
[43:30] assault but you say I can't see
[43:33] it it's because that's how they are the
[43:39] spirits these demonic spirits you are
[43:42] saying he you guys are talking about I
[43:43] know in the Book of Revelation there

[44:44] reading the Bible with reading the
[44:47] message of the hour feeding yourself on
[44:49] those things amen

[44:57] and for you if you have to sit back and
[44:59] listen if you have to sit back and look
[45:02] around and look at the framework of our
[45:06] faith something is

[49:31] keys for
[49:32] granted we are not realizing that these
[49:35] are the keys that amen is the weapons
[49:39] given to us to overcome the
[49:44] strongholds so we need to use the word
[49:46] of God to overcome strongholds amen
[49:50] hallelujah so we've got to open up the
[49:52] kingdom of God to Believers and close it
[49:54] to unbelievers
[49:56] so if the Keys of the Kingdom are given
[49:58] to you you can lock and

[50:06] your pears among swines what does it
[50:09] mean lock the

[50:29] Earth shall be bound in
[50:31] heaven you see nothing that we do you
[50:34] and I who are born again Sons and
[50:37] Daughters of God is without meaning
[50:41] every
[50:42] action every word we speak is recorded
[50:45] in
[50:47] heaven the power of our word this is how
[50:50] we operating right now by the power of
[50:52] the spoken word amen amen so that is is
[50:55] why we got to be so careful in this time
[50:57] in this season the words we speak amen
[51:01] amen people coming against us amen the
[51:03] words we speak they don't realize amen
[51:06] that they can call you a balded man go
[51:08] goad go on baled
[51:10] man and you have power to
[51:15] call she
[51:19] Bears
[51:22] amen praise the Lord
[51:26] let's try and bring this to a close now
[51:28] so the key Kingdom has keys amen that
[51:31] key is revelation you can lock and
[51:33] unlock don't be don't be disturbed when
[51:36] people don't want to hear you lock the
[51:38] door and move yes amen they're shutting
[51:40] out their own salvation one day they
[51:43] can't come to you how come you never
[51:44] open this door to me brother that day I
[51:46] was opening this door you told
[51:48] me take your keys and move you were
[51:52] satisfied with your Apostle your
[51:53] denomination and your teaching that's
[51:55] right
[51:57] amen you were seeking blessings natural
[52:00] blessings amen you were seeking just
[52:03] wealth that's all people want is
[52:06] wealth amen praise the Lord amen the
[52:10] modern day Christian Church is nothing
[52:11] but a
[52:12] gimmick that preaches
[52:17] Prosperity
[52:19] amen so we find here what does it mean
[52:22] to be violent in spirit the kingdom of
[52:25] God suffer with violence and the violent
[52:27] take it by
[52:31] force amen so you need to be spiritually
[52:36] violent you can't play with the devil
[52:38] that's right
[52:42] amen the Bible says that this guy is an
[52:46] adversity he's not an adversity to be
[52:48] played with
[52:50] yes you think this guy is some Mickey
[52:52] Mouse he rebelled against the god of
[52:55] Heaven
[52:57] he deceived Adam and Eve he deceived the
[53:00] entire
[53:04] world so don't go playing in his
[53:06] grounds he's come now to play in your
[53:09] territory he's come now to create a
[53:12] stronghold within you amen you know
[53:16] that the prophet says that unforgiveness
[53:19] bitterness and all of these things can
[53:21] lead to
[53:22] sickness amen so what is that creating a
[53:24] strong within you so we got to watch
[53:27] these things here in Psalm 144:1 it says
[53:31] blessed be the Lord my strength which
[53:33] teacheth My Hands to
[53:37] War blessed be the Lord my strength
[53:40] which teacheth My Hands to War and my
[53:43] fingers to fight
[53:45] amen
[53:47] amen we need some Amasia spiritual
[53:53] amas amen
[53:59] God is not opposed to spiritual
[54:04] violence if the heart and intent is
[54:07] Right amen but we must be familiar with
[54:10] the law and you know generally in the
[54:13] police force what they tell you brother
[54:14] Joshua most of the time they can't use
[54:16] deadly
[54:20] force but in this
[54:23] Kingdom it's a requirement
[54:26] for you to use deadly
[54:29] force
[54:31] amen you can't go and attack Satan's
[54:35] kingdom with pet
[54:39] guns you can't put electric bed
[54:42] wires or bed wires and electric
[54:46] fencing Satan don't get shocked don't
[54:48] get scared of small
[54:50] shocks you need Atomic Warfare amen
[54:53] what's Atomic Warfare that's say the
[54:55] Lord who has thus sa the Lord in this
[54:57] hour the bride has th Sayed the Lord she
[55:01] has the mind of Christ she knows what he
[55:03] wants done with the word amen so we know
[55:06] that God can use natural force in the
[55:08] Bible to make people do things like he
[55:10] use natural force of the flood to take
[55:13] eight people into the ark and one man in
[55:15] a Rapture amen so God can use floods he
[55:18] can use earthquakes he can use a swarm
[55:20] of locust to let God's people go free
[55:24] yes he amen you can use natural
[55:27] force amen the laws of
[55:30] nature to cause Egypt and the Army
[55:35] pharaoh and the Army to let God's people
[55:40] go so God can use natural
[55:42] force and he can use it as a sign of
[55:45] punishment like he did they in Noah's
[55:47] day
[55:49] amen but there's also spiritual forces
[55:52] that God is using how many of you know
[55:54] what that is how many of you know who
[55:56] are God's spiritual forces right
[56:01] now yes because Earth is the Angel's
[56:09] domain unto the Angels God said you
[56:12] shall have dominion over the
[56:17] Earth God said I will have dominion over
[56:19] the
[56:22] Earth what did God say
[56:25] man shall have dominion over the
[56:27] Earth can God go against his own
[56:32] law that is why there's a fight for
[56:36] man because the Earth belongs to
[56:39] man so demon powers want to influence
[56:42] man so they can operate through man
[56:45] demon powers don't have jurisdiction
[56:46] over the Earth they've got to operate
[56:49] through
[56:50] men same
[56:52] way the Angelic forces
[56:55] God is on the earth holy spirit is on
[56:57] the earth amen Earth belongs to man so
[57:00] he wants to possess man so the war is
[57:03] hot and heavy amen this is not the time
[57:05] to be sleeping amen this is not the time
[57:07] to be amen amen creating strongholds in
[57:10] our hearts so what are what is the Bible
[57:12] saying are strongholds the Bible uses
[57:14] this term strongholds because they are
[57:16] armful thoughts and patterns arrogant
[57:19] attitudes amen
[57:22] hallelujah unforgiveness bitterness
[57:24] strongholds amen these beliefs amen lead
[57:27] to something and it it creates something
[57:29] in the spiritual realm it leads to
[57:31] demonic
[57:32] influence don't think all you know what
[57:34] bitterness is it's a demonic attack on
[57:36] you right right unforgiveness is a
[57:38] demonic attack on
[57:40] you you know when you get angry that's a
[57:43] demonic attack because you allowing that
[57:46] person to have power over you and you
[57:48] are angry with that person so which
[57:50] means that person has a stronghold over
[57:52] you amen amen amen we got to break these
[57:56] things and here in 2 Corinthians 10:4
[57:59] and 5 I'm going to read this version it
[58:00] says the weapons of our Warfare are not
[58:03] carnal it's not weapons of the
[58:06] world but we have divine power to
[58:08] demolish strongholds amen but they are
[58:11] Mighty to the pulling down of
[58:13] strongholds the Bible says so we
[58:16] demolish
[58:17] arguments and every I think that exalts
[58:19] itself against the knowledge against the
[58:22] revelation of God and we take
[58:26] captive every thought and make it
[58:29] obedient to Christ amen you mean if I
[58:31] change my thinking I can change my faith
[58:33] my belief
[58:39] yes greatest
[58:41] Battleground the
[58:43] mind you mean if I change my thought my
[58:46] thinking pattern and align it to the
[58:47] word of God yes because it must drop
[58:50] down from here to here once it drops
[58:53] down to the heart it takes root and now
[58:56] God has a
[58:57] stronghold God has Dominion amen so
[59:00] we're demolishing things amen hallelujah
[59:04] amen how do you break stronghold once
[59:06] you recognize this you may be saying
[59:07] okay I recognize the stronghold within
[59:09] me I have this thing I need it to get
[59:11] out of me you got to stop now and bring
[59:14] it to repentance amen amen you got to be
[59:18] honest before God amen amen yes amen you
[59:21] got to Humble ourselves and let the
[59:23] spirit expose it
[59:25] yes and say Lord I don't care you know
[59:27] that's why in the back in the day there
[59:29] was true repentance in the church people
[59:32] are not ashamed the only thing they
[59:33] wanted to get right with God the prophet
[59:36] says I hated dryed confession he said
[59:39] when people you know the word of God is
[59:41] sharp it's powerful it can penetrate the
[59:43] heart that even now while the word of
[59:45] God you can't be bothered about the next
[59:47] person sitting there the only thing that
[59:49] matters is that we must get right with
[59:50] God Amen so that that amen eliminates
[59:54] everybody else it's just me and God if I
[59:56] need to cry out to him Lord help me I'm
[59:58] crying out to you Lord Jesus I'm
[1:00:00] reaching out to you amen so we got to
[1:00:02] come to a true repentance be honest
[1:00:04] before God Amen and let the Holy Spirit
[1:00:08] expose that stronghold of Darkness amen
[1:00:11] yes Lord
