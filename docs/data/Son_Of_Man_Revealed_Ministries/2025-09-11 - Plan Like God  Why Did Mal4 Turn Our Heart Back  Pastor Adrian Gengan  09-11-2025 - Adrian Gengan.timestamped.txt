[0:01] I'm feeling a bit lightheaded. So, just
[0:03] pray God strength. I think it's the
[0:04] heat.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; Not many of you were here on Wednesday
[0:09] where I mentioned that I was brought up
[0:11] in a stormtrooper background. But
[0:13] nonetheless, I've seen God God's hand
[0:16] from a little baby. So, I can stand here
[0:18] confidently and say that I'm a living
[0:20] testimony of what God has done in my
[0:22] life and what he's still doing in my
[0:24] life.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; I pray this song will be a blessing.
[0:53] This is the moment. moment
[0:58] where everything
[1:00] turns.
[1:03] I didn't think I would see it. Was hard
[1:07] to believe. Heaven crashes your words.
[1:15] I've read the stories
[1:20] of all that you've done.
[1:25] The water the sea and captives free.
[1:30] Never thought I'd be.
[1:36] I am a living breathing walking tears.
[1:47] Are you living through what the cast
[1:58] memory
[2:16] You said I'll let you make it
[2:22] that I should give up.
[2:27] But they didn't know that the God that I
[2:31] serve is more than enough.
[2:37] He can move mountains.
[2:42] Beging, broken, beautiful.
[2:47] You're a light out of hope. When I bless
[2:50] you, God of Mary,
[2:57] I am the
[2:59] living.

[5:14] with a mey.
[5:18] You surround me with
[5:22] a song
[5:27] of deliverance
[5:31] from my enies.
[5:35] Till I feel
[5:43] no longer
[5:46] safe
[5:48] to fear.
[5:52] I am a child
[6:03] to fear.
[6:08] I am a child.

[14:50] people are set free. Oh God,

[15:12] Lord that the angel of God will move
[15:14] through this audience. Oh God, I'm
[15:15] expecting Lord a manifestation of your

[15:45] Add a little touch of smile to it.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Don't make them scared.
[15:52] Praise the Lord.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[16:24] missed you.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; The Lord's grace. Amen. Upon your life.
[16:27] Amen. Also, Brother Yuri was traveling.
[16:30] He was in the UK, but he's back. The
[16:32] Lord brought him back safely. Amen.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh for brother Kenzo, brother
[16:38] Joseph, we haven't seen you all in a
[16:39] while. We pray the Lord has renewed your
[16:42] strength.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That you can be found back in the
[16:44] house of the Lord to worship him.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So be glad. You know, each one of
[16:48] us carry a measure of faith.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you're not here, we
[16:52] definitely miss that portion of the
[16:54] faith that you're carrying.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; And uh this morning, Amen. Want to
[16:59] welcome our brother Paul. Amen. Let's
[17:00] give him a hand as we welcome. Amen.
[17:05] Amen. Is visiting with us this morning.
[17:06] So we pray the Lord will bless him.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we have uh brother Kenyan
[17:11] family up in Johannesburg this this
[17:14] weekend. Amen. So we pray that the Lord
[17:15] will be with them back safe traveling
[17:18] mercies. Amen. You ready for the word of
[17:20] the Lord?
[17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; We also want to appreciate the song.
[17:25] Amen. Our sister Kim sang.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our life is a living
[17:28] &gt;&gt; breathing testimony.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. It must manifest from the pages of
[17:34] this book into flesh.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's turn to
[17:38] Revelation chapter 10. We'll read our
[17:41] portion of scripture there. Amen. If it
[17:44] had not been for Revelation 10,
[17:47] &gt;&gt; we wouldn't be sitting here.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can say amen to that.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:56] So, young people, just pay attention to
[17:57] the scripture as well. This is the
[17:59] message that we believe. It says, "But
[18:01] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[18:03] angel, when he shall begin to sound,
[18:07] &gt;&gt; the mystery of God should be finished as
[18:11] he had declared to his servants the
[18:14] prophets."
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; So everything about God
[18:18] now that the seventh angel has sounded,
[18:19] it's finished.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are living in that time and
[18:23] season now where it's finished. Let's
[18:25] turn to uh Amen. Deuteronomy 29:29.
[18:30] Praise
[18:32] the Lord.
[18:42] Deuteronomy 29:29 says, "The secret
[18:45] things belong unto the Lord our God."
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; The secret things belong unto the Lord
[18:52] our God, but those things which are
[18:55] revealed belong unto us
[18:57] &gt;&gt; and to our children forever. Amen.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; That we may do all the words of this
[19:03] law.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the secret things that have
[19:06] been revealed to us by Revelation 10:7
[19:08] belong to us and our children.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; And our children's children.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So the Lord blessings
[19:16] through the reading of his word. You may
[19:17] be seated. We turn to one more portion
[19:19] of scripture. Psalm 84:10.
[19:22] Amen.
[19:25] also.
[19:29] Amen. Good to see our brother sitting in
[19:31] the back there. Amen. God bless you this
[19:33] morning. Amen.
[19:41] Psalm 84 and:e 10 says, "For a day in
[19:44] thy courts is better than a thousand."
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; How many of you can say amen to that?
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. A day in thy courts
[19:55] is better than a thousand.
[19:58] I had rather be a doorkeeper in the
[20:00] house of my God.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Than to dwell in the tent of wickedness.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; For the Lord God is a son and a shield.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; For the Lord will give grace and glory.
[20:17] No good thing will he withhold from them
[20:21] that walk uprightly. Amen.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Some of you didn't uh comprehend that.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; No good thing
[20:30] &gt;&gt; will he uphold withhold from them that
[20:33] walk up rightly.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is at this time he's not
[20:39] withholding anything from us.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now last week we were speaking on
[20:46] God's planning. How God plans and we
[20:48] were showing you how planning is an
[20:50] attribute of God. Amen.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He planned redemption from before
[20:54] the foundation of the world. And
[20:58] we were looking at this now and we were
[21:00] just want to progress the thought a bit.
[21:02] Amen. And show you how God plans ahead
[21:05] of time. If we just look maybe at the
[21:07] story of David for a while. Amen. You
[21:10] know, God had planned David to be king.
[21:14] Amen. Before Goliath came in on the
[21:16] scene.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; God planned ahead of time. Amen.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; God anointed ahead of time.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; God didn't wait for Goliath to come in
[21:26] on the scene and then now try and look
[21:28] for a man.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; God had already trained a man.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; God had already prepared a man.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; God had already anointed a man.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; So when the time came the man can step
[21:39] forward.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; So God also did not wait for Saul to die
[21:46] before he anointed David to be king.
[21:50] Saul was now an ex
[21:51] &gt;&gt; anointed.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; But yet he's king,
[21:57] &gt;&gt; but he's no more anointed.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Now, this is a kingdom principle. We've
[22:04] got to understand kingdom principles.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; We find many churches are in disarray
[22:09] because the pastor died and the church
[22:11] doesn't know how to move forward.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; But let's see how God plans. Yes.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; God planned ahead of time.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; He made a way for the children of Israel
[22:24] by anointing another man.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; He knew that Saul would not be able to
[22:30] meet the challenge of the hour.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; So, he raised a man, anointed him,
[22:36] &gt;&gt; and one day it looked like by chance,
[22:39] but this was not chance.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; The footsteps of the righteous are
[22:43] ordered of the Lord.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; You know, according to the Israelite
[22:49] people itself, they thought that the
[22:52] army of Israel was brave men,
[22:55] &gt;&gt; warriors.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; They were fighting the Philistines.
[23:00] That was THEIR IMPRESSION OF WHAT WAS
[23:02] GOING ON in the army. Remember, they
[23:04] didn't have cell phones.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; They didn't have somebody videoing there
[23:08] and showing these Israelites trembling
[23:09] in their boots. SO THEIR IMPRESSION OF
[23:12] WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE WAR scene was
[23:14] that the children of Israel were
[23:16] fighting
[23:17] &gt;&gt; and overcoming.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; Little did they know. Amen. And David
[23:22] now will give us an insight into how
[23:24] what was happening there on the scene
[23:26] &gt;&gt; because his father now creates an
[23:29] opportunity for him to go onto the front
[23:31] lines. BUT GOD IS GOING TO USE the
[23:33] situation to bring the anointed man TO
[23:36] THE CHALLENGE OF THE HOUR.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH,
[23:41] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; SO, it it LOOKS LIKE A SIMPLE ACT. Take
[23:43] an epha of roasted grain. Now, if you
[23:46] don't know what that is, some of you
[23:47] like fried meies.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; So, his father sent fried meies.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Are we reading that? Okay, if you find
[23:56] that in the book, you'll see that he
[23:58] sent him roasted grain. He sent 10
[24:00] loaves of bread and 10 cheese to the
[24:02] brothers at the camp. Amen. Now, this
[24:05] sending forth would lead him to his
[24:07] destiny.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Wherever God is leading you, it's
[24:12] leading you to your destiny,
[24:13] &gt;&gt; TO YOUR PURPOSE,
[24:15] &gt;&gt; TO UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL THAT'S laying
[24:17] within you.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; SO ASK OURSELVES, HOW ARE WE handling
[24:22] our current encounters, trials, and
[24:24] temptations and testing.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Now, God plans ahead of time. So, God
[24:31] already let him have an encounter with
[24:33] the bear.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; And he killed the bear. GOD LET HIM
[24:38] ENCOUNTER A LION AND HE KILLED A LION.
[24:40] He couldn't understand why God was
[24:42] presenting him challenges like this.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; Why such ferocious animals?
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Because there would be a ferocious
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Philistine.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God was sending ferocious animals.
[24:58] God wasn't sending small little things
[25:00] over there.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; He sent a bear.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; He sent a lion.
[25:05] He's sending sickness your way.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; He's sending persecution your way.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; He's sending problem AFTER PROBLEM YOUR
[25:11] WAY.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You're wondering WHY YOU'RE IN THE
[25:13] SITUATION.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; GOD IS PREPARING YOU. AMEN.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; For your final victory over the enemy.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; So, your past experiences we are
[25:23] learning from this is preparing YOU FOR
[25:26] YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT'S LAYING
[25:27] AHEAD.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; SO, DON'T QUESTION GOD.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; OURS IS NOT TO QUESTION WHY. GOD KNOWS
[25:35] WHAT HE IS DOING.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; You know, maybe you're questioning,
[25:38] Lord, why couldn't I grow UP IN A BETTER
[25:40] ENVIRONMENT? WHY COULDN'T I GROW up in a
[25:41] BETTER HOME? WHY COULDN'T MY
[25:43] CIRCUMSTANCES be different?
[25:46] David didn't go back to his father and
[25:47] say, "What can you know children of
[25:50] today?"
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Entitled.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; If it was a 21st century child,
[25:56] &gt;&gt; what they call them generation alpha,
[25:59] what what gen are we now?
[26:02] Autumn we in Gen 8 alpha they would have
[26:06] said what can't father you sending me
[26:08] there lion is coming you sending me
[26:12] there bear is coming you don't care for
[26:15] me
[26:16] &gt;&gt; today's children would have said that
[26:19] &gt;&gt; you're very irresponsible
[26:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to call child line for you
[26:24] &gt;&gt; today's children would have done that
[26:26] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[26:29] &gt;&gt; amen
[26:30] &gt;&gt; now you tell them before we should
[26:32] hiding
[26:32] &gt;&gt; now. You tell them go face the corner,
[26:34] they're crying.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; You give them a time out, they already
[26:37] crying. They can't handle pressure.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; So he didn't question his father, why
[26:46] you put me out here to take care of the
[26:48] sheep?
[26:50] And remember, whatever God has given
[26:52] you, protect it with your life.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Be a good steward of what GOD HAS GIVEN
[26:56] YOU.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS GIVEN charge over the sheep
[26:59] and he protected it with his very own
[27:01] life.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; God saw I can use a man like this.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; If he can risk his life to take care OF
[27:07] SHEEP, HOW MUCH MORE WILL HE LEAD MY
[27:09] PEOPLE?
[27:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID I FOUND A MAN AFTER my own
[27:13] heart.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; This man when he HAD SINNED LATER ON HE
[27:17] WAS ONE THAT OUT OF REPENTANCE AND HE
[27:20] SAID LORD TAKE NOT THY HOLY SPIRIT FROM
[27:23] ME.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; RESTORE UNTO ME THE JOY OF THY
[27:25] SALVATION. LET'S CONTRAST THAT WITH
[27:28] SAUL. SAUL KNEW GOD HAD REJECTED HIM.
[27:30] BUT HE WAS SO PROUD.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; YOU WON'T READ SAUL SAYING, "LORD, OH,
[27:34] TAKE NOT THY HOLY spirit from me.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Don't take your anointing from me,
[27:38] Lord."
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; SOL DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF A HEART.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; AND IT HAS TO DO WITH CHARACTER.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO DON'T CRY AND ASK GOD WHY THE
[27:50] BEAR.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; DAVID DIDN'T SAY, "OH, YAMA, THE bear is
[27:52] coming and running."
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; He stood AND HE FACED THE CHALLENGE.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. What is God doing? Shaping and
[28:03] molding your character.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Making you be able to
[28:07] handle the power that's going to be
[28:09] unleashed through you.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? There's a
[28:12] power going to be unleashed through you.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Because power, Saul had power without
[28:20] character.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Let's take that example what the prophet
[28:24] says. Now Saul had power without
[28:26] character and he was not fit to rule.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; But David, David had power with
[28:31] character and he was fit to rule. So
[28:33] therefore God set him up as the king.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; You know Saul as well is a example of
[28:39] modern day preachers in the message as
[28:41] well.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; He came over there and Saul showed him
[28:47] his armor.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; The armor was for protection. Somebody
[28:51] tell me the word is for protection. The
[28:53] word is our protection.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; You agree? The word is our protection.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Saul could explain what the third
[29:00] pool can do.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Are somebody listening to me?
[29:05] &gt;&gt; BUT SAUL HIMSELF AT THAT TIME, HE DIDN'T
[29:08] WHY DIDN'T HE HAVE THE ARMOR ON HIMSELF?
[29:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE BIBLE DESCRIBES SAUL, THE BIBLE
[29:13] SAYS HE WAS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE ALL
[29:15] THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE MOST SUITED man to take on
[29:18] Goliath.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. BUT IN THE TIME OF THE
[29:21] CHALLENGE OF THE HOUR, THIS MAN was
[29:23] without his armor,
[29:25] &gt;&gt; but he was busy explaining TO DAVID, YOU
[29:27] KNOW, IF YOU PUT ON this armor here,
[29:29] &gt;&gt; you can go out there and challenge him.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Don't live higher than you preach.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me about the third pool if
[29:38] you can't manifest the third pool. Oh,
[29:40] brother, this is what the third pool can
[29:42] do.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Show me.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How many years we going to
[29:49] hear about the third pull and what it
[29:50] can do?
[29:53] &gt;&gt; You don't have the armor on. He couldn't
[29:55] manifest what he was talking about.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; But he wanted somebody else to put on
[30:00] his armor.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; You can't take on somebody else's
[30:03] experience.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we are learning here. Amen.
[30:09] That Saul had the mechanics,
[30:13] &gt;&gt; but he didn't have the dynamics.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is this econom?
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Just check. It's a bit warm here. Amen.
[30:21] Praise the Lord.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Saul had the mechanics, but he didn't
[30:24] have the dynamics.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; He could explain to David the mechanics,
[30:31] but could not produce the dynamics. He
[30:33] could not manifest what he was talking
[30:35] about.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; People can preach and explain to us the
[30:38] deep mysteries of God, but it must
[30:40] manifest.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Saul, we are learning,
[30:45] was no longer the mouthpiece of God.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; We're going somewhere with this.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Saul was no longer the mouthpiece of
[30:51] God.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; David was now the mouthpiece of God.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; So what is God's program for 2025?
[31:01] &gt;&gt; God's program is being known, made known
[31:03] through you and me.
[31:06] If anybody wants TO SEE THE REVIVAL
[31:08] THAT'S HAPPENING, if anybody wants to
[31:10] know the program of God, YOU MUST POINT
[31:12] them to yourself.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; I am THE PROGRAM OF GOD.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; I AM WHAT GOD IS CURRENTLY DOING ON THE
[31:19] EARTH RIGHT NOW.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; YES.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; NOW, let's ask ourselves one question.
[31:26] Why did God
[31:29] Why did God send Malachi 4:5 and 6, the
[31:32] prophet Elijah the prophet? Put it up,
[31:34] brother. For those that maybe don't know
[31:36] it, the younger ones especially. Amen.
[31:39] Let's put up the scripture itself. Amen.
[31:44] It says, "Behold, I will send you Elijah
[31:46] the prophet before the coming of the
[31:48] great and dreadful day of the Lord." Who
[31:50] is God going to send? Somebody say,
[31:52] "Me." Amen.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; You see, people think this scripture is
[31:56] about the prophet.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; He's talking to you. Behold, I sent you
[32:02] &gt;&gt; amen,
[32:03] &gt;&gt; William Brandom.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Before the coming of the great and
[32:06] dreadful day of the Lord.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; So, I'm talking to you. I'm sending you
[32:10] a prophetic ministry.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; What is he going to do? He shall turn,
[32:15] we know this is twofold, right? The
[32:16] first part was John the Baptist. Turn
[32:18] the heart of the fathers to the
[32:19] children. And the second part, the heart
[32:21] of the children to their fathers, lest
[32:23] they come and smite the earth with a
[32:25] curse.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Now pay attention to this. Ask ourselves
[32:29] now. Then why did God send Malachi 4 to
[32:33] turn our hearts back?
[32:36] &gt;&gt; Why must our hearts be turned back?
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Who wants to answer?
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Okay, everybody's everybody's reasoning
[32:48] now. Why did God send us a prophet to
[32:50] turn our hearts back?
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Now remember, God is a God of purpose.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; God is a God of a plan. He has a purpose
[33:00] in doing this.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So why? Now we're going to take it
[33:05] from the prophet. How many of you want
[33:06] the prophet to answer it and not Adrien
[33:08] Genan?
[33:09] &gt;&gt; How many of you want the prophet to
[33:10] answer it?
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We've been given a
[33:13] prophetic gift for a reason.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if I give you the answer,
[33:17] you're going to say, "See that Bruna,
[33:18] he's trying to inject something there."
[33:21] &gt;&gt; Let's see what the prophet says why our
[33:23] hearts are turned back. We might read a
[33:25] bit, but I want you to understand what
[33:28] we are reading. Amen. And see why.
[33:32] So the this is just a summary, right, of
[33:34] what the prophet is saying. It's taken
[33:35] from resume of the ages. And the prophet
[33:38] is saying, "For seven out of the for
[33:40] seven out of the seven ages, I have seen
[33:43] nothing but men esteeming their own word
[33:45] above mine."
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Hey, it mustn't happen in the message.
[33:48] Eh,
[33:50] &gt;&gt; people esteeming their word above God's
[33:52] word.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; So, at this end of the age, I'm spewing
[33:55] you out of my mouth. Ladies here,
[33:58] &gt;&gt; gone.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; It's all over. I'm going to speak. All
[34:02] right. Yes. I am here in the midst of
[34:05] the church. The amen of God, faithful
[34:07] and true, will reveal himself and it
[34:09] will be by my prophet.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Pay attention now.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Then he reads Revelation 10:7. As it
[34:17] was, Amen. In the days of the voice of
[34:19] the seven messenger, when he shall be
[34:21] given the son, the mystery shall be
[34:23] finished. There it is. He's sending a
[34:25] vindicated prophet. He's sending a
[34:27] prophet after almost 2,000 years. He's
[34:29] sending someone who is so far from
[34:31] organization, education, world of
[34:34] religion that as John the Baptist and
[34:36] Elijah of old, he will hear only from
[34:38] God and he will have thus sayith the
[34:40] Lord and speak for God.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Right. Watch how he's going to time
[34:44] Malachi 4 to this ministry. Now he will
[34:46] be God's mouthpiece as he as he had
[34:49] declared in Malachi 46 will turn the
[34:52] hearts of the children back to the
[34:53] fathers here. Now he will bring the
[34:56] elect of the last day that they will
[34:59] hear a vindicated prophet give the exact
[35:01] truth as it was with Paul. He will
[35:04] restore the truth as they had it.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Now remember that is dealing with Elijah
[35:10] the prophet
[35:11] &gt;&gt; what he will do.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; But we WANT TO SEE OUR PART IN IT.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; He's going to go right next to our part
[35:17] now. How many of you ready for our part?
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And those elect with him in that
[35:21] day will be the ONES WHO TRULY MANIFEST
[35:24] THE LORD.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Why is HE TURNING OUR HEARTS BACK?
[35:29] &gt;&gt; TO MANIFEST THE LORD.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; MANIFEST means to make known.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; So the Lord will be made known.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Right? Are we paying attention?
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; First part, they will truly manifest the
[35:43] Lord. Second part, be his body.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:48] Third part, BE HIS VOICE.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Why is he turning our hearts?
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; To manifest him
[35:56] &gt;&gt; to be his body.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; TO BE HIS VOICE. DOES it end there?
[36:00] &gt;&gt; To do what? Perform his works.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Hallelujah. Do you see
[36:06] it?"
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; How many of you now know why our hearts
[36:08] have been turned back?
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet gives us the answer to
[36:13] make known Christ to be his body to be
[36:16] his voice and to perform his works.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; We tying this in with Saul not being the
[36:27] mouthpiece and us being the mouthpiece.
[36:29] We are the David of today, right? He
[36:32] says a momentary consideration of church
[36:34] history will prove how accurate this
[36:36] thought is. In the dark ages, the word
[36:39] was almost entirely lost to the people.
[36:42] But God sent Luther with the word. The
[36:44] Lutheran spoke for God at that time.
[36:46] They organized the pure word lost for
[36:48] organization tense towards dogma and
[36:51] creeds. Not simple word. They could no
[36:53] longer speak for God.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Then God sent Wesley. Same thing
[36:56] happened. Right? Then now watch what he
[36:59] says. The people who took his revelation
[37:01] from God became living epistles read and
[37:04] known of all men for their generation.
[37:07] Amen. Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Are we the living epistles ready and
[37:10] known for today?
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pay attention now. Amen. When the
[37:14] Methodists failed, God raised up others
[37:17] so that it has gone on through the years
[37:18] until in this last day, there is again
[37:21] another people in the land.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; God has a plan. God knows what he's
[37:26] doing. There's a people in the land who
[37:29] under their messenger will be the final
[37:31] voice to the final age.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The church denominations now
[37:38] is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It's
[37:40] his own mouthpiece. God is turning on
[37:42] her. He will confound her through the
[37:44] prophet and the bride.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Believe me, THEY ARE ALREADY CONFOUNDED
[37:48] BY THIS PROPHET.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; That part has already been fulfilled.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE CONFOUNDED BY THIS PROPHET.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[37:57] Honest men when you find their reviews
[37:59] on YouTube, they can't understand how
[38:01] the power of God was used so mightily in
[38:03] this man was displayed so mightily
[38:05] through this man.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; They don't understand Luke 17:30, right?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Why will he confound her through the
[38:13] prophet and the bride? The voice of God
[38:15] will be
[38:17] &gt;&gt; in her.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Now we know why our hearts have been
[38:21] turned back. The voice of God to be in
[38:23] us.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Right. It says in Revelation verse 17,
[38:29] Amen. last chapter of Revelation verse
[38:31] 17, the spirit and the bride say come
[38:33] once more. The world will hear direct
[38:35] from God as at Pentecost. But of course
[38:37] the word bride will be repudiated. That
[38:39] means rejected as in the first age.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Now he has cried out. I I put this part
[38:47] here because I want message people to
[38:48] wake up. He says he cried out in this
[38:51] last age. You have the word.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:55] YOU HAVE MORE BIBLES THAN EVER. YOU HAVE
[38:56] MORE SPOKEN WORDS THAN EVER. But you are
[38:59] not doing anything about the word except
[39:01] dividing and hacking it into pieces.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Taking what you want and leaving out
[39:11] what you don't want. You are not
[39:12] interested in living it but debating it.
[39:15] This is the prophet. Now
[39:16] &gt;&gt; people are not interested in living this
[39:19] message but more interested in debating
[39:21] it.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:24] Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Concludes with this. God still has a
[39:29] voice for the people of the world. What
[39:31] is this voice given to us for now? Let's
[39:33] follow the thought. Why did he turn our
[39:34] hearts? We must be the voice of God. The
[39:36] mouthpiece of God,
[39:38] &gt;&gt; right? Why the mouthpiece of God? God.
[39:41] What is his who who is his voice for?
[39:44] Let me ask you that way. Who is his
[39:45] voice sent for? Now, let's follow the
[39:48] thought. The prophet was sent for you.
[39:52] When you become the mouthpiece, who are
[39:54] you sent for? The prophet is saying God
[39:56] still has a voice for the people of the
[39:58] world.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Your voice is meant for the people of
[40:01] the
[40:02] &gt;&gt; world. Even as he has given a voice to
[40:06] the bride, the voice is in the bride.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Your voice is meant for the people of
[40:11] the world.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Your voice is meant for the people of
[40:16] the world.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; You know me, I only like to fellowship
[40:18] with the believers.
[40:20] You know when you're eating food? How
[40:21] many of you eating chicken anytime or
[40:23] eating food and there's no salt?
[40:27] &gt;&gt; The other day I was eating food at work
[40:29] and the the food didn't have much salt
[40:31] in it. And I was looking for salt
[40:33] everywhere. I couldn't find salt.
[40:37] Jesus said, "You are the salt."
[40:41] &gt;&gt; You know how it felt the kale? I
[40:43] couldn't find salt anywhere.
[40:47] And I thought if I could only find some
[40:49] salt, this curry will taste so much
[40:51] better.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; And that's how the world feels.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; The world is
[41:04] eating nonsense. No salt.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; But you are the salt.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SALT, BUT THEY CAN'T
[41:09] FIND YOU.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; I hope you're catching my analogy. Amen.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; OR IF I COULD JUST HAVE SOME SALT.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; My career would be better.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; They're looking for you. YOU ARE THE
[41:23] SALT.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WALKING IN GROSS DARKNESS. IF I
[41:28] COULD ONLY HAVE SOME LIGHT. JESUS SAID,
[41:30] "YOU ARE THE LIGHT."
[41:32] &gt;&gt; You know, me and me, I only fellowship
[41:33] with eagles.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; I only stay around the eagles.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; You're not like Jesus then.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; They condemned Jesus. said, "Why are you
[41:43] there with the sinners?"
[41:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Let your light shine so before
[41:51] &gt;&gt; men.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Your light must shine before men.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; You're blinding us here
[42:00] &gt;&gt; because all of us have light. Now you
[42:02] come with your own light. You know when
[42:03] you put headlights on and you moving
[42:05] there, you're blinding us
[42:06] &gt;&gt; because you're only bringing your light
[42:07] here and showing us how much you know
[42:08] here.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. Soon as you go in the
[42:12] world, you switch your torch off.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Me, I'm undercover agent. Nobody knows.
[42:16] No, I got light.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; You come in the church here, as soon as
[42:22] you enter the door, you switch your
[42:23] torch, you blind us.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; No, bro. That's not right. That's not
[42:27] right. Everything is not right.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Our light must shine outside.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; We must be a living testimony wherever
[42:36] we go.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You don't like that?
[42:41] But anyway, it's a word.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Now, he's going to give you a voice, but
[42:48] there must be something that accompanies
[42:49] the voice.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "This age started just at the
[42:53] turn of the 20th century as it was to be
[42:55] in the age in which the true church
[42:57] would return to being the bride she was
[42:59] at Pentecost."
[43:01] &gt;&gt; We know that there must of necessity
[43:04] &gt;&gt; be a RETURN OF DYNAMIC POWER.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; It's necessary right now.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. for there TO BE A RETURN OF
[43:11] DYNAMIC POWER.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; I'M TIRED OF A POWERLESS GOSPEL. TIRED
[43:15] OF A POWERLESS RELIGION. AMEN. WE NEED
[43:17] THE POWER of God back in the church
[43:20] &gt;&gt; like IT WAS AT PENTECOST. IF YOU DON'T
[43:22] KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT PENTECOST, READ
[43:23] THE BOOK OF ACTS.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; WE NEED THE POWER OF GOD TO BE FLOWING
[43:27] THROUGH THE CHURCH
[43:28] &gt;&gt; WHERE A MAN SITTING AT THE GATE
[43:30] beautiful and say, "OH,
[43:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; HAVE MERCY on me. Give me something."
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Right. AMEN.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Give them something.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter and John do not have money.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; But what they had, THEY GAVE.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; STOP TELLING PEOPLE YOU DON'T HAVE
[43:50] MONEY.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Tell them I don't have the money, but
[43:53] what I have, I'm going TO GIVE YOU RIGHT
[43:54] NOW. PRAY FOR THEM.

[44:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[44:09] by the word of truth from the messenger
[44:11] of to this age in will be the fullness
[44:13] of Pentecost for the spirit will bring
[44:16] the people right back to where they were
[44:18] at the beginning. That is thus sayith
[44:21] the Lord.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; How many of you know thus say the Lord
[44:24] don't fail?
[44:26] &gt;&gt; This is your prophet now.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; This is the last prophet to the
[44:29] Gentiles. Yeah.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; He is saying that they will return back
[44:33] to the fullness of Pentecost for the
[44:35] spirit will bring the people right back
[44:37] to where they were at the beginning.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; This is thus say the Lord.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; This is uniting time. Amen. You see
[44:45] churches uniting. You see religions

[44:49] The prophet of God is saying here, Amen.
[44:51] Amen. It's uniting time for God and his
[44:54] bride, too.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; I say this with respect and reverence.
[44:58] I believe the bride is called. I believe
[45:00] she's sealed into the kingdom of God. I
[45:02] believe the mechanics is there. They're
[45:04] waiting for the dynamics that will take
[45:06] her off the earth.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; They're waiting for David to come. David
[45:12] brought the mechanics. Dynamics.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Hey, David brought the dynamics to
[45:15] Israel that day.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; They are waiting for David to rise in on
[45:18] the scene.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] waiting for the dynamics to take off the
[45:29] earth into glory in the rapture. I
[45:31] believe with all my heart, we don't know
[45:32] how he's going to do it, but he's going
[45:34] to do it. He is the dynamics. Amen. We
[45:37] just become members of the machine of
[45:39] his body, forming ourselves into his
[45:41] image. We're going to with a purpose.
[45:43] Amen. Watch.
[45:45] Watch now what he says. We are forming
[45:47] ourselves into his image. And see him
[45:49] uniting himself with us in his works.
[45:53] How is he uniting himself with us?
[45:56] &gt;&gt; In his works. So where must the works be
[45:58] seen? Through me.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; With his love gifts.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; As he hands them out to us when at the
[46:08] marriage supper.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody read with me. He's going to
[46:11] hand out these love gifts at the wedding
[46:12] supper because you know a wedding
[46:14] ceremony has already taken place. Where
[46:16] do people bring the gifts? Somebody say
[46:18] to the reception.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Some of you still owe people gifts.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[46:26] Where is he going to hand out the gifts?
[46:27] Love gifts.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody read with me.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Just before the wedding supper.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; So you mean now?
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; THEN SAY, LORD, GIVE ME THE LOVE GIFTS.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let your works be displayed
[46:43] through me. I WANT THE LOVE GIFTS as he
[46:45] hands them to us just before the wedding
[46:48] supper.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:55] Praise the Lord.
[46:58] What is this dynamics you're talking
[47:00] about? How many of you don't know what
[47:01] the dynamics is?
[47:03] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to know what the
[47:05] dynamics is? He's saying the must come
[47:06] dynamics to the church.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Let's see what he's saying. The dynamics
[47:10] is the dynamics of this church will be a
[47:12] refilling of the Holy Spirit.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; People want to be refilled once once
[47:17] they want to be filled. Go read the book
[47:18] of Acts. They got fulfilled in got
[47:20] filled in acts chapter 2 but in acts
[47:22] chapter 4 they went for a refilling.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; He saying the dynamics coming to this
[47:27] church will be a refilling of the holy
[47:29] spirit
[47:31] &gt;&gt; that we have worked in a small measure
[47:33] while the headstone is coming down to
[47:35] unite with the body.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; The intelligence is coming down to unite
[47:40] with the body.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; If you don't know what that is the cloud
[47:44] of 1963
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Christ has come down
[47:47] &gt;&gt; to unite with the body. Amen.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; But he says as they are uniting with the
[47:51] body, the dynamics will become to the
[47:53] church.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; But when the head and body unites
[48:01] together, the full power of the Holy
[48:03] Ghost would raise her up just exactly
[48:06] like that. Even the dead
[48:08] &gt;&gt; that's dead in Christ for hundreds of
[48:10] years will rise in the beauty of
[48:11] holiness, take a flight to the skies.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm say you now understand why
[48:18] our hearts were turned back.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; We must become the voice
[48:22] &gt;&gt; of God. Our voice is meant for the
[48:24] world.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And through us also
[48:28] our hearts are turned back so that the
[48:29] works of God can be seen through us.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; So give the Lord the best that we can.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Here now the
[48:42] prophet of s he's talking about this
[48:43] woman. You remember who brought the
[48:45] spike out of oil ointment?
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; And washed his feet.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody remember that.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; She wanted the best. She said he's
[48:54] deserving of the best.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Watch our approach to Sunday morning
[49:01] church. When we coming to church on a
[49:03] Wednesday as well, give him our best.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Come, you know, we go for interviews,
[49:08] suddenly we're looking for ties.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; We want to make an impression.
[49:13] You go for a wedding, you don't wear
[49:15] nonsense.
[49:17] You put on your suits. Even if you don't
[49:20] have other people getting married, you
[49:21] going buying new suits.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The sisters going to buy new
[49:25] dress. Why? You want to look your best.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; You want to look the part.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; We come to church. People think you're
[49:32] going to play soccer.
[49:34] Where are you going? You're going to the
[49:36] beach. No, I'm going to church. Why you
[49:38] dressed like that?
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Give God your best. The prophet of God
[49:42] says it now. We must give him our best.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; We must do our best.
[49:48] Is this the prophet saying it? He is
[49:50] deserving of the best. And he is. Don't
[49:53] give him a little corner.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Give him all you got.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm trying to encourage you
[50:00] now.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; He deserves the BEST THAT YOU'VE GOT AND
[50:03] THE BEST THAT you can do.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; That's all she had. That's she know she
[50:10] got it. She know how she got it. You
[50:14] see, you know how she got this.
[50:17] She was a loose woman.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; But whatever money she made,
[50:22] &gt;&gt; she took it and she bought something for
[50:24] the Lord.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Right. She didn't argue with him about
[50:29] the price.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; That wasn't it. She just wanted the
[50:34] best. And if I flip the script and I
[50:37] show you, Jesus didn't ask, "Hey lady,
[50:39] where you bought this thing? Where the
[50:40] money came from?"
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't ask this woman where this
[50:47] money came from.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; No. No. You got it through some, you
[50:52] know, you I'm trying to put my holy
[50:55] voice.
[50:57] You know, this money came by
[50:58] unsolicitated ways. You know, in this
[51:01] church, we don't take that kind of
[51:02] funds. Judas,
[51:09] I'm not saying I want unsolicited funds.
[51:11] I'm showing you Jesus.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Why are you thinking about me now?
[51:17] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you to think about what Jesus
[51:19] did.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't ask where you got this
[51:22] money from.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Give him your best.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Give him your best.
[51:34] Right? Don't be uphazard about serving
[51:36] the Lord.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Let's read what the prophet is saying
[51:39] here. Jesus never went and died on the
[51:42] cross or some appazit affair.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; He didn't treat it uphazard.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; This is salvation. THIS IS LIFE ETERNAL.
[51:49] WHY MUST WE treat it up as it?
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Imagine he's saying now imagine Jesus
[51:55] went on the cross. Perhaps somebody
[51:57] might feel sorry because he died.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; That's what denominations are doing now.
[52:02] They're preaching an emotional message,
[52:04] &gt;&gt; preaching to your flesh.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; They want you to feel sorry
[52:10] &gt;&gt; because he died so he can so they come
[52:13] to get saved,
[52:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:17] God doesn't run his business like that.
[52:19] God runs his business by fornowledge
[52:22] &gt;&gt; knowing before the world was ever formed
[52:25] who was his own.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; So Jesus died on the cross for all those
[52:29] names that were written in the book.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that God would ever run
[52:35] his office in an appazit way.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't run mine. You wouldn't run
[52:39] yours either. How are we running our
[52:41] affairs?
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Haphazard.
[52:44] How are we running our businesses? Are
[52:46] we running it like kingdom businesses?
[52:48] Amen. Are we a man of our word? Are we
[52:51] keeping to our promise?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Are we Amen. Are we bringing distribute
[52:54] to the gospel? Remember, we are
[52:57] representing God in all areas of our
[52:59] lives. Yes.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; When we go to school, we are
[53:01] representative of the kingdom.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; When we go to work, we are
[53:04] representatives of the kingdom.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; When we go, Amen. to business, we are
[53:08] representatives of the kingdom.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; You'll find this in the message. I don't
[53:13] have the quote here, but you're going to
[53:14] find there. God says, uh, the prophet
[53:16] says there, if God made you a farmer, he
[53:18] says you are now supposed to associate
[53:20] with your business associates and
[53:22] witness to Christ about them,
[53:24] &gt;&gt; to them about Christ. He says, if you
[53:26] made a housewife, you witness to the
[53:29] neighbors. You witness to your friends
[53:30] about Christ. In whatever position he
[53:32] placed you in, you are there to
[53:34] represent the kingdom.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; God never does nothing. Just like we do.
[53:40] We just kind of up as a people just
[53:42] stroll along. Well, if this happens,
[53:47] it's all right.
[53:50] It's illegal to not have a plan
[53:53] &gt;&gt; according to Egyptian municipality.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; It's illegal to build without a plan.
[53:58] Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; In God's kingdom, it's illegal to not
[54:01] have a plan.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; To have a purpose for your life.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; So, you can't just be like, "Ah, you
[54:06] know, whatever happens, what you doing?"
[54:07] Nah, nothing, man.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; We'll see. You know me, I'm waiting on
[54:11] the Lord. I don't know what you're
[54:12] waiting for.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Do you know that's a spiritual saying?
[54:20] &gt;&gt; To sound spiritual now. You don't have
[54:22] an answer for the brew. So, to keep him
[54:23] quiet, you know me, I'm waiting on the
[54:24] Lord.
[54:28] Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Some of you don't like that, but when I
[54:34] leave the port now, then you're going to
[54:35] see what the prophet said.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We just kind of
[54:40] strolling along. Oh, what if this
[54:42] happens? It's all right. And if that
[54:44] happens, it's all right. But God has a
[54:46] real definite meaning for everything he
[54:48] does.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; And I believe if we are his servants, we
[54:51] would obey him. I believe the Bible says
[54:53] the footsteps of the righteous is
[54:55] ordered of the Lord. Amen.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; So don't be a hazard about our lives.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Why? The message that we have is not an
[55:08] appazit message.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; This is the pearl of great price.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Don't live life
[55:16] aimlessly without a purpose. Don't be
[55:18] drifting AND EXPECT GOD TO be pleased
[55:21] with us.
[55:26] Some of us feel like now the the song
[55:27] leader must now come here and announce
[55:29] now because you made an appearance to
[55:31] church today.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, giving us a guest
[55:35] appearance today.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; And we want God to be pleased with us.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Things are not working out right in our
[55:44] life. Let me tell you why. I'm not a
[55:46] rocket scientist, but I can tell you
[55:48] why.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; You're not faithful to the things of
[55:50] God. Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Nothing will work out right because
[55:54] you're not faithful to the things of
[55:55] God.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; What does the Bible say? All things work
[55:59] together for the good of them that
[56:03] &gt;&gt; No. Me, I love God, but you'll never
[56:04] find me in his house. I love him from
[56:06] far.
[56:09] Me, I love God from far,
[56:13] but you'll never find him there by the
[56:14] things of God. You'll never find him on
[56:16] a prayer meeting. I love God from far.
[56:22] Because me, my favorite song, the love
[56:24] of God is greater far. They
[56:25] misunderstood that words now.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody smile.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're in your father's house.
[56:34] Relax.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know why you're getting
[56:36] stressed.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have fun anywhere else. You
[56:40] can't come here and rejoice in the house
[56:41] of the Lord.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Some so religiously now like we said,
[56:50] you know, I'm waiting on the Lord.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; You know, the only time you're supposed
[56:54] to wait on the Lord when you're weak.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; You apply that scripture for every other
[56:59] thing in your life. The Bible says they
[57:01] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[57:03] their strength. So if you got no
[57:05] strength, go wait on the Lord.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; But now some people are full of
[57:09] strength. They're still waiting.
[57:12] You're supposed to wait on the Lord when
[57:14] your strength is weak.
[57:16] Now, Moses looks so holy. I'll give you
[57:18] some examples now. You say, "Give me
[57:20] examples. I feel like a lawyer and I
[57:22] have to prove everything."
[57:24] Moses looks so holy and so righteous at
[57:27] the Red Sea.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Crying at the Red Sea.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; CRYING AT YOUR PROBLEM.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; CRYING AT YOUR SITUATION.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; CRYING AT YOUR MOUNTAIN FOR WHAT?
[57:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:41] GOD SENT you and commissioned you,
[57:43] Moses.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; And you're crying to him like a baby.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; He chose you for this purpose. HE
[57:50] COMMISSIONED YOU FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND
[57:52] YOU'RE GOING CRYING.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Exodus 14:E 13. He tells the people, now
[58:01] watch, he sounds brave. MINISTRY CAN
[58:03] SOUND BRAVE TOO.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Easy to command the people, stand still.
[58:08] SEE THE SALVATION OF THE LORD.
[58:12] WHAT HE WILL SHOW YOU TODAY FOR THE
[58:14] Egyptians whom you have seen today. You
[58:16] shall see them no more forever.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; THE LORD SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU AND YOU
[58:22] SHALL hold your peace.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Watch now the Lord the Lord says to
[58:26] Moses,
[58:28] why cries out to me?
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Speak to the children of Israel THAT
[58:33] THEY GO FORWARD.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE COMMISSIONED FOR THIS TIME AND
[58:38] SEASON.
[58:39] SPEAK AND GO FORWARD.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; You know me, I'm just waiting here. The
[58:42] pastor never come to visit me. I'm
[58:44] waiting for him to come. WHY ARE YOU
[58:45] WAITING? GOD GAVE YOU THE POWER. GOD
[58:47] GAVE YOU THE AUTHORITY TO HANDLE THE
[58:49] DEMONS IN YOUR LIFE.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; YES.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; YES,
[58:57] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there WHEN YOU ALLOWED THE
[58:58] DEMON TO BIND YOU.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Now I must come and I've unbind you.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; You allowed the demon to bind you. TELL
[59:05] ME I'M NOT SPEAKING the truth. The
[59:06] prophet said, "Where you left Jesus,
[59:09] &gt;&gt; that's where you'll find him."
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; NOW, I MUST COME LIKE the inspector
[59:13] gadget now and look where you left
[59:14] Jesus.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; I don't KNOW WHERE YOU LEFT JESUS. YOU
[59:18] KNOW WHERE YOU LEFT JESUS.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; YOU GO BACK AND YOU FIND I AM NOT A
[59:22] DETECTIVE. NEITHER ARE THE BROTHERS here
[59:24] detectives to come and find out where
[59:25] you left Jesus.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; You know where you left Jesus.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAYS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN
[59:31] FIND HIM, GO BACK, FIND WHERE YOU LEFT
[59:33] HIM AND INVITE HIM BACK. SOMEBODY GIVE
[59:35] GOD PRAISE.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; You must come now and counsel. You know,
[59:43] brother, what's happening? I don't know.
[59:45] Now, you don't know and I how you expect
[59:47] me to know.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; You stop being honest. You know,
[59:50] brother, I'm backslitting.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm backslitten.
[59:54] You know, I stopped serving the Lord for
[59:56] so long.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Be honest.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Be like David, a man after God's own
[1:00:01] heart. Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Why are you crying to me? Speak and go
[1:00:06] forward. Speak and go forward. Speak and
[1:00:10] go forward.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Because footsteps mean possession.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, that's one example.
[1:00:18] I mustn't stand and wait. Speak and go
[1:00:21] forward." Well, let's put up Acts. ACTS
[1:00:23] CHAPTER 1. NOW, THIS WOULD BE A
[1:00:25] MARVELOUS THING TO BEHOLD. JESUS
[1:00:27] ASCENDING TO HEAVEN. But look what the
[1:00:29] angels tell them. You men of Galilee,
[1:00:31] why stand ye gazing into heaven?
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; You know, this is a sight to behold. I'm
[1:00:39] witnessing the Lord Jesus Christ ascend
[1:00:41] to heaven. I want to take it in.
[1:00:48] The angels are coming to tell them
[1:00:49] immediately, "This part of the drama is
[1:00:52] over."
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Nobody's getting this.
[1:00:59] They are witnessing the Lord ascend to
[1:01:01] heaven.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; But the plan is not over yet.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; The story is NOT OVER YET. GOD DOESN'T
[1:01:06] WANT YOU TO stand still now and wait and
[1:01:08] say, "Wow, look at this thing here. This
[1:01:11] great sight." The angel come and
[1:01:12] immediately tell them, "Why are you
[1:01:14] gazing?"
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Why are you gazing up into heaven? He
[1:01:20] says, "This same Jesus which is taken up
[1:01:22] from from you unto heaven shall come
[1:01:24] again in like manner as you have seen
[1:01:26] him go into heaven." So this part of the
[1:01:29] drama is over. Why are you gazing? They
[1:01:31] wanted to take it in. They were in awe,
[1:01:33] but the angels expected them to move on
[1:01:35] to the next part. Where were they
[1:01:36] supposed to be? In the upper room.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Some are still gazing at the Mustri
[1:01:44] cloud of 1963.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; I am just in awe of this. But now it's
[1:01:49] 2025.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; It's 2025.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. It's time to take your be cut
[1:02:00] and your bell bottoms from the 60s and
[1:02:03] put it away. It's 2025.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Why you gazing?
[1:02:12] Still trying to understand it. WHY ARE
[1:02:14] YOU GAZING? Some read the message after
[1:02:16] 40 years they still don't know what the
[1:02:18] message is about.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Ever learning. Yes.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Never able to come to the knowledge of
[1:02:22] the truth.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Some still don't understand the
[1:02:25] mysteries.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:28] You say, "Why are you saying I mustn't
[1:02:31] stand and wait?" Let's see how the
[1:02:33] prophet, God dealt with the prophet.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Our prophet was very honest.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; He denied nothing.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; If God rebuked him, he put it there in a
[1:02:42] sermon.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; This is standing in the gap. Remember my
[1:02:45] point now. Why are we waiting?
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Who you waiting for? What you waiting
[1:02:49] for?
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; You're the prophet. Now I this is now
[1:02:55] the prophet detailing what happened to
[1:02:58] him. He says I was told you had called
[1:03:01] me to be a prophet and I want to live in
[1:03:03] the wilderness like the prophet. You see
[1:03:04] it sounds so spiritual. You know a lot
[1:03:07] of people say you know me I want to go
[1:03:08] full-time. They gone fulltime and
[1:03:09] they're half time.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; They're not doing anything fulltime.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; They waking up late. They're having
[1:03:20] breakfast late. They're doing nothing
[1:03:21] for the kingdom.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:24] Hello.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; How many of you know if you're going
[1:03:27] fulltime,
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; you must go wake up and start job 8:00?
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; that's true.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; You're saying, "Hey, bro, why you making
[1:03:37] it out for yourself? When you go
[1:03:38] fulltime, they're going to hold you to
[1:03:39] this.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Come on."
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Hear what the prophet is saying. He is
[1:03:46] saying, "I want you to go in the
[1:03:48] wilderness like a prophet of the whole."
[1:03:49] Why he saying? See, I was using my own
[1:03:51] excuse so I could hunt is
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; this is honest prophet.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; He's saying he wants to eat. He's
[1:03:59] bluffing them. He's going in the
[1:04:00] wilderness like the prophet. But he's
[1:04:02] saying, "Hey, I want to go hunt."
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; My own good.
[1:04:09] And he said, "But that was the prophets
[1:04:11] of the Old Testament. You've been called
[1:04:13] there in a much higher office than
[1:04:15] that." Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Some of you have greater gifts and
[1:04:19] greater talents, but you've been called
[1:04:21] to a much higher place.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Get out of the situation you're in right
[1:04:25] now.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Let's read. He said you HAVE MORE GIFTS
[1:04:29] BESIDE THAT.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; You have more gifts beside that.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; You were called to pray for the sick and
[1:04:39] preach the gospel. and the apo and in
[1:04:41] the apostolic form you know of greater
[1:04:43] things many great gifts
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; he said why do you wait for me here we
[1:04:49] going now
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; why do you wait for me to move every
[1:04:53] time you move
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; you know me I'm just waiting on the Lord
[1:05:01] the Lord finished commission you go into
[1:05:03] all the world
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; preach the gospel
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; make disciples of all men
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; theord God already anointed you. You're
[1:05:11] saying, "No, me, I'm waiting. You're
[1:05:12] preaching pastor this morning on David.
[1:05:14] Me, I'm waiting for the Lord to come
[1:05:15] anoint me like David." He finish anoint
[1:05:17] you. Go read Revelation 10:8 to 11.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; He anointed you with the word.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; You are the anointed of today.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; You are the anointed David of today.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Watch now while he rebukes him. Why do
[1:05:33] you wait for me to move every time you
[1:05:36] move?
[1:05:38] Where is your reward?
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Then I seen see he came to his
[1:05:44] realization. You forgot the feeling of
[1:05:46] your people. You forgot the call that I
[1:05:50] called you to.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Have we forgotten our call?
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Have we forgotten what God has called us
[1:05:56] to?
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I let the sick lay.
[1:06:03] Some of us let the sick lay. I want the
[1:06:06] Lord to tell me where to go and where
[1:06:07] not to. You know, Brew, you know, we got
[1:06:10] to go on a fast here now because you
[1:06:12] know what are we doing? He commissioned
[1:06:15] us.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Sunonny, for that.
[1:06:19] Amen.
[1:06:21] Everyone else was just following me.
[1:06:25] I let the sick lay.
[1:06:27] I want the Lord to tell me where to go
[1:06:29] and not to.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we learning from this?
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; That's
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; that's what
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; wrong.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to read it because you don't
[1:06:46] believe me. I want you to read it.
[1:06:48] That's wrong.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; For you to wait for God where to tell
[1:06:51] you where to go and what to do.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; It's wrong.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; God already said lay hands on the sick.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Now you know I'm waiting on the Lord.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; What you waiting for?
[1:07:05] Who are you waiting for?
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Hey Brew, isn't it time to close now?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; We still got a few more minutes. Can I
[1:07:18] finish?
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; I let the sickle. I don't know why you
[1:07:22] take it so personally. I'm reading what
[1:07:23] the Lord told the prophet.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm reading what the Lord told the
[1:07:30] prophet, but in the capit's way.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; I want the Lord to tell me where to go
[1:07:38] and where not to.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; That's wrong. I built myself a complex
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; because the people didn't hear my
[1:07:45] message.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Go here. Go talk to one another and say
[1:07:48] about outreach and see what they tell
[1:07:50] you.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; You I challenge you. Go ask one of these
[1:07:53] brothers here about outreach and see
[1:07:54] what they tell you about outreach. Yeah,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; because they built a complex because
[1:07:59] people didn't want to hear their
[1:08:00] message.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; They'll give you all kinds of excuses.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; You don't believe me? Go ask somebody
[1:08:07] now after the service.
[1:08:12] Go ask them.
[1:08:14] Jesus says, "The harvest is plentiful.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; My laborers are few."
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; He says, "Pray the Lord of the harvest
[1:08:21] will send laborers into the vineyard."
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:26] Praise the Lord. We need to pick the

[1:09:21] have I none. Oh, waiting for the
[1:09:23] manifestation of the sons of God. When
[1:09:25] God will make himself known, they'll
[1:09:27] stop sickness. Who's going to stop
[1:09:29] sickness? Somebody say, "Me."
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:10:07] disease.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; WHO IS ON THE LORD'S SIDE? SAY, "PRAISE
[1:10:10] THE LORD."

[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; How many of you notice here?
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Who's the one supposed to be waiting?
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; According to scripture, creation is
[1:10:21] waiting. Yeah.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; NOT THE SONS OF GOD.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; THE SONS OF GOD ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
[1:10:28] WAITING. ALL CREATION is waiting.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; THE DEAD IN CHRIST IS WAITING.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Let them wait. But let us AS A CHURCH BE
[1:10:35] ON THE MOVE.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, IT'S NOT OUR REPUTATION AT
[1:10:40] STAKE.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; IF GOD SAID, "LAY HANDS UPON THE SICK,
[1:10:43] THEY SHALL RECOVER." You lay hands upon
[1:10:45] the sick.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL HAVE TO BACK UP HIS OWN WORD.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, thank you, Lord.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go to the next one,
[1:10:54] brother. THERE'LL BE A POWER PUT INTO
[1:10:56] THE CHURCH.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You can get this in Yim. I don't
[1:11:00] think I have it there. 130360 1960. He
[1:11:04] says there'll be a power put into the
[1:11:06] church. If you type up those words, put
[1:11:08] into the church.
[1:11:11] There's a power put into the church.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; How many of you want that power to be
[1:11:15] put in you? Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; He says there'll be a power put into the
[1:11:19] church.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; And is now coming in that the Holy
[1:11:23] Spirit will so anoint the people till
[1:11:26] they'll speak the word.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; They'll speak the word and it'll create
[1:11:32] itself right there.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; God's not looking for people. God is
[1:11:37] looking for sons AND DAUGHTERS WHERE
[1:11:40] POWER WILL BE PUT INTO THE CHURCH. It
[1:11:41] will so anoint the people. They'll speak
[1:11:44] and it'll create itself right there.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Or if you can only speak right now, if
[1:11:50] you can only speak over your situation
[1:11:52] right now, let it create itself right
[1:11:54] now.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. The reason why we are
[1:12:02] not receiving back 100fold, the reason
[1:12:04] back why we are not seeing this, we are
[1:12:06] NOT GIVING OURSELVES AWAY BECAUSE
[1:12:08] THERE'S SCRIPTURE. THERE'S A LAW THAT
[1:12:09] SAYS GIVE.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Luke 6:38.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:12] Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; The reason whatever situation we are
[1:12:16] find ourselves in right now is because
[1:12:17] of what we have sown.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; You reap what you sow.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, you know in our own
[1:12:24] lives where we let down the bars.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; When we were letting down the bars, when
[1:12:28] we were after our own selves, we were
[1:12:29] sowing.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; You sow to the wind and now you're
[1:12:33] reaping a world win.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; You sowed for that.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Now you're not happy about the harvest.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yeah.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; You reap what you sow. I forgot Luke
[1:12:47] 6:38. Then it says, "Give." So it will
[1:12:52] come back to you.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; How is it coming back? Good measure,
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; pressed down,
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; shaken together
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; and running over.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; You give love, you sow love, love will
[1:13:04] come back to you. Good measure. Pressed
[1:13:05] down, shaken together and running over.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You give hell, what's
[1:13:12] going to come back to you?
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Hell is going to come back to you.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Good measure, press down. We can't find
[1:13:20] Luke 6:38. Give and it'll come back to
[1:13:23] you. Good measure, press down, shaken
[1:13:25] together, and running over.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; For the same measure that you meet for
[1:13:32] all, it shall be measured to you again.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Give and it'll come back to you.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to come back to you
[1:13:40] good measure, pressed down, shaken
[1:13:41] together, running over.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever you give to the Lord is
[1:13:45] going to come back to you 100fold.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; See, he says God is good. He wants us to
[1:13:50] get the best that we have. I'm closing
[1:13:52] with this now. He wants us to get the
[1:13:56] best that we have. God wants you to have
[1:13:57] the best.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "God wants me to have the
[1:14:00] best."
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; God wants me to have the best.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; We his children, he wants to give us the
[1:14:05] best that there is. Somebody said the
[1:14:07] message of the hour is the best thing
[1:14:08] you could ever give me.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Message of the hour.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I know some of you are thinking
[1:14:14] about that uno you were looking at.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; God wants to give you the best. He gave
[1:14:20] you the best thing he could give you.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; God sent Jesus the best gift he could
[1:14:28] give the world.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; He wants TO GIVE US THE BEST. He gave us
[1:14:34] the message of the hour. a shout.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; He wants us to have the best there is.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; With a cream of his crop.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; He wants us to have the best there is.
[1:14:46] You believe that?
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Well, then in all other areas of your
[1:14:52] life,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; I was telling brother Romesh the other
[1:14:54] day, remember our conversation? We were
[1:14:57] talking about gyra. We were talking
[1:15:00] about healer. You know, we very
[1:15:02] spiritual in other talks too.
[1:15:05] You know the material things don't
[1:15:06] matter to me.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; When he's coming with seven compound
[1:15:16] names.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; When he's Rafa, is he coming as Rafa?
[1:15:21] You need healing now. You're sick. Say
[1:15:23] you got cancer. How many of you need
[1:15:24] spiritual healing then?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Who needs spiritual healing when they
[1:15:31] got cancer in their body?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:34] How many of you will pray Lord heal me
[1:15:35] spiritually
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; or do you need physical healing?
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; So as Jehovah Rafa is coming to heal you
[1:15:42] physically
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; nobody wants to walk with me
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; when your peace and your joy is taken
[1:15:48] away. Jehovah shalom must he come
[1:15:50] spiritually and give you peace or must
[1:15:52] he come and give you physical peace
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; salvation
[1:15:58] of your soul.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; What about gyra? Amen.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Who knows what gyra is?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Swami if you want to provide spiritual
[1:16:07] only
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; or you think that's physical.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; No, because you know why? Uh because
[1:16:14] when Abraham was uh the pal when when
[1:16:17] Abraham was sacrificing there Isaac,
[1:16:21] they needed a spiritual lamb to come.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; What he needed?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; So why we talk spiritual?
[1:16:33] All the seven redemptive names are to
[1:16:35] meet men's physical needs.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. God will bless us spiritually. In
[1:16:47] fact, we are defeating our words because
[1:16:50] Ephesians tells us we are already
[1:16:52] blessed.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Is it 1:3? Ephesians 1:3.
[1:16:57] Hey, how can we go ask God for something
[1:17:00] it's already there? You know, we got
[1:17:02] very nice prayers. Lord, bless me. Lord,
[1:17:06] uh physically, but above all,
[1:17:07] spiritually.
[1:17:10] Hey, who prays that prayer? Come on now.
[1:17:13] Nobody wants to hear this truth. We are
[1:17:16] praying graffited prayers.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; You hear so spiritually. Lord bless us
[1:17:19] physically but above all spiritually.
[1:17:21] But you you are you are praying a prayer
[1:17:23] that hits the ceiling and come down
[1:17:24] because God says here we are blessed
[1:17:27] with all spiritual blessings already.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; So you don't need spiritual blessings.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Who's hearing me?
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; You already have spiritual blessings.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; What you need physical?
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody choking and saying what do you
[1:17:45] need?
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Physical.
[1:17:50] Hey, I'm just reading the Bible here.
[1:17:53] Blessed be the God and father of our
[1:17:54] Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; blessed us
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:18:01] places in Christ.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; So that prayer you heard some
[1:18:05] denominational person pray, please stop
[1:18:07] repeating it.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; And when you are praying, I want fresh
[1:18:11] prayers.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; You can't be praying every week and
[1:18:13] you're saying the same words.
[1:18:16] Every week you say the same prayer.
[1:18:18] That's not talking to father.
[1:18:21] Every week they make you pray. Every
[1:18:23] week you say the same thing.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Prayer is communication.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; I'm saying what's on this every week he
[1:18:31] say to me.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Prayer is talking to your father.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Imagine every day you only have two
[1:18:42] words of hello. How are you? every day,
[1:18:44] 30 days in a month, 365 days a year, you
[1:18:48] only say hello, how are you? Hello, how
[1:18:50] are you? Hello, how are you?
[1:18:54] Same prayer.
[1:18:59] Prayer is supposed to be communication
[1:19:00] to the Lord.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; And you're not supposed to be praying
[1:19:02] from your flesh, man.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be praying from your
[1:19:05] spirit man.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:11] I better get out the school picture.
[1:19:12] People waiting with daggers here for me.
[1:19:15] Amen. Proverbs 10 and verse4.
[1:19:19] This is a person now we slack.
[1:19:23] He become athlet that dealth with a
[1:19:26] slack hand. Lazy hand.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Who's this person? Hey, I'm reading
[1:19:31] Bible.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Some of you don't want to say amen to
[1:19:34] the Bible.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; He becometh poor that dealth with a
[1:19:37] slack hand. But the hand of the diligent
[1:19:39] maketh.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Don't be lazy.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; He's trying to force his way into you.
[1:19:45] Everything he can. Ask abundantly that
[1:19:48] your joys might be full.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of you must try it.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; You got no joy. Jesus is saying, "Ask
[1:19:57] abundantly that your joy may be full."
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; What's he trying to do? Force it to you.
[1:20:02] You're saying, "Pastor, why every week
[1:20:03] you're preaching this thing?" In some
[1:20:06] way, you're bringing it. I'm trying to
[1:20:07] force it into you.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Ask abundantly that your joy may be
[1:20:13] full. He wants his people to be happy.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Ask great things believing for great
[1:20:19] things.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; You are a city on the hill. High
[1:20:23] ambitions, expectations.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; If we see the blind receive it sight
[1:20:28] tonight, I want to see the dead raised
[1:20:30] tomorrow.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Don't be satisfied with one thing. Yeah.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Have higher expectation. I saw the blind
[1:20:37] man healed. I'm expecting resurrection
[1:20:39] of the dead.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; And I want you to just keep on believing
[1:20:42] for greater things. Who's believing for
[1:20:44] greater things?
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; I want you to keep believing for greater
[1:20:47] things.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm telling you, don't
[1:20:50] be satisfied with your current
[1:20:52] situation.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; David didn't run back and tell his
[1:20:56] father, you know, you you know, you
[1:20:57] couldn't you made me handle the bear.
[1:20:58] You made me handle the lion. Now, even
[1:20:59] worse, there there's one goliath there.
[1:21:03] Own
[1:21:05] your situation.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; God put you there for a reason.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. God put you there for a reason.
[1:21:10] God raised you up for this reason to
[1:21:12] defeat your
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Goliath.
[1:21:23] children to have the best that there is.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; You know, bro, I wish the prophet never
[1:21:28] said this. Some of you so offended.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; God thinks the same way about his
[1:21:36] children because he's a parent. He wants
[1:21:39] his children to have the best that
[1:21:42] there.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] And we're here to pray and hold with you
[1:21:48] together for the promises of God until
[1:21:51] you get your heart desired.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; What are we here to do? We are here to
[1:22:01] pray and hold with you.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Because if two or more agree upon
[1:22:06] anything,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; we are here to hold together with you
[1:22:09] until you get your heart's desire. Yes.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; If you're sick, we are praying with you
[1:22:17] until you get your heart's desire.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; If you're in lack or you need, we are
[1:22:22] here to hold and pray with you until you
[1:22:25] get your heart's desire.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; And we know that he will give it to you.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; The one thing that we have to move up
[1:22:37] now is to supreme faith.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; You cannot have faith until you
[1:22:41] perfectly know what you're doing. You
[1:22:43] know, and there he describes faith. Now,
[1:22:44] he says faith is as good as you saying,
[1:22:46] I'm going to start the car. He says it's
[1:22:48] an act of faith. You just believe the
[1:22:49] car is going to start. He says,
[1:22:51] "Tomorrow I'll meet you at a certain
[1:22:52] place." That's an act of faith. You've
[1:22:54] done it so much
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; because it's a regular routine with you.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; That's the way with the things of God.
[1:23:01] After you have trusted him and watched
[1:23:03] him do it so many things till it just
[1:23:05] becomes a regular routine.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; The supernatural becomes routine to you.
[1:23:10] Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; The supernatural becomes routine to you.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; The supernatural becomes part of your
[1:23:15] everyday life.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; And that's the condition I think the
[1:23:20] church will be just before the coming of
[1:23:22] the Lord. Are we just before the coming
[1:23:24] of the Lord now?
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; So the rapture will go right that way.
[1:23:32] The regular routine.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; And following the scriptures and the
[1:23:37] plans of God.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] How many of you are ready to receive
[1:23:42] now?
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to close.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; How many of you are ready to receive?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you this one thing and
[1:23:50] I'm closing. I promise you I'll be
[1:23:51] closed in the next couple minutes.
[1:23:55] When you go to Matthew 9:22, you'll see
[1:23:58] Jesus saying to the woman who touched
[1:24:00] the hem of his garment, "Daughter, be of
[1:24:02] good comfort, thy faith."
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; I am saying this morning, it's going to
[1:24:08] take your faith.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Right now, whatever you believe in the
[1:24:11] Lord for, trusting the Lord for, it's
[1:24:13] going to take your faith.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Jesus faith that made a whole.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "Daughter, thy faith
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; had made thee whole."
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And the woman was whole from that hour.
[1:24:29] You hear what the prophet says? God
[1:24:31] hadn't shown him anything. God didn't
[1:24:33] show Jesus anything about this woman.
[1:24:35] That's right. But the woman's faith that
[1:24:38] touched that gift.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; When the Lord ascended on I, he gave
[1:24:41] gifts unto men.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you something here.
[1:24:45] Now, pay attention
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; cuz you're going to receive something
[1:24:47] right now if you can touch the gift of
[1:24:49] God.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; What was it? The woman with her faith
[1:24:55] had contacted God through the son of
[1:24:57] God.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Apply the same principle this morning.
[1:25:00] Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; You can contact God through his gift.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; The woman with her faith had contacted
[1:25:08] God through the son of God and had drawn
[1:25:11] from the son of God her
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; that was the woman using God's gift.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Hear what he says now as I close. God
[1:25:21] gives things after preaching is
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; so who's asking right now?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Who's going to draw?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. right now.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; He says God gives things after preaching
[1:25:33] his word.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Sending preachers, he puts gifts. He's
[1:25:38] not willing that any should perish.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; He wants you to what? Don't you read
[1:25:43] properly. He wants you to
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; He died for what purpose?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; You mean he died for me to prosper?
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on. Let's read.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Let's read it again. He wants you to
[1:25:59] He wants you to be
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; healthy.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; He died for that purpose.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Romesh Jesus died for you to prosper.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus died for you to be healthy.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; He does everything that there is even
[1:26:18] appearing himself to prove it to you.
[1:26:20] And still some people sit back. See some
[1:26:22] people are sitting back now.
[1:26:26] Ah, you know, he's like a denomination
[1:26:28] preacher. Now,
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; I am not a denomination preacher. I read
[1:26:31] all quotes to you. That's right.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; So, call the prophet a denominational
[1:26:34] preacher.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you, Lord.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Was it my quotes?
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; It was a prophet's quotes.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; I read back the prophet's quotes.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; So, if you are insulting me and calling
[1:26:47] me a denominational preacher, prosperity
[1:26:49] preacher, you are insulting the prophet.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Hello. Come on. I'm picking up the
[1:26:54] spirit. That's why I'm dealing with it.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, preach it. Amen.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it again. Let's stand.
[1:27:01] He wants
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody say me.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; To prosper.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; He wants me.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; He wants me
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; to be healthy.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; to be healthy.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; He died for that
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; purpose.
[1:27:15] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But spirits don't die. I see. And
[1:27:21] still people sit back then say, "Well,
[1:27:22] it's mental telepathy. It's mind
[1:27:24] readading. It's of the devil." This is
[1:27:25] not of the devil.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; This is of God.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; You need to drink and push out all of
[1:27:31] God's plan for your life.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Receive it. Receive it. Receive it.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Remember what he said. The woman touched
[1:27:38] the M of his garment by using God's
[1:27:40] gift.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; What do you want right now?
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; The gift of God is here.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Undeniable. Let's come musicians. Thank
[1:27:49] you Jesus.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; 3 John 1:2 you say, you know, give me a
[1:27:57] scripture, beloved.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; 3 John 1:2,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; I wish above all things
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; that thou mayest prosper
[1:28:09] and be in health. You see, people only
[1:28:12] want prosperity of their soul. The
[1:28:14] Apostle John, which is a type of the
[1:28:15] bride,
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; he's saying, "Beloved, I wish above all
[1:28:18] things that thou mayest prosper and be
[1:28:21] in health even as your soul prospers."
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Some I don't want to say this, but let
[1:28:29] me say it. I don't know if you're ready.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Some people souls are in heavenly
[1:28:33] places,
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; but physically in hell.
[1:28:40] Sure.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; But he says, "All things thou mayest
[1:28:46] prosper and be in health
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; even as thy soul prosperth."
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Don't let your soul be in heavenly
[1:28:54] places.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; You are a son of God.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing a song. Amen. Praise
[1:29:01] the Lord. How many of you ready to sing?
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Worship him. Give me G. Amen. Let's put
[1:29:05] up that song for the church.
[1:29:10] My heart can sing when I pause to
[1:29:14] remember.
[1:29:16] A heartache here
[1:29:19] is but a stepping stone
[1:29:25] along a trail
[1:29:29] that's winding
[1:29:31] all ways upwards.
[1:29:37] This trbled world
[1:29:41] is not my final.
[1:29:46] The things of earth, the things of earth
[1:29:53] will dim and lose its value.
[1:30:00] If we recall,
[1:30:02] if they just borrowed for a while
[1:30:10] and all the things
[1:30:14] that cause you to trouble,
[1:30:20] remember they
[1:30:24] will only
[1:30:27] a smile. Let's sing until then.
[1:30:30] But until then,
[1:30:34] my heart will go singing.
[1:30:41] But until then
[1:30:45] with joy I'll carry on
[1:30:51] until the day
[1:30:55] my eyes behold that city.
[1:31:01] Until the day
[1:31:04] God calls
[1:31:07] you. Let's sing. But until then,
[1:31:11] but until then
[1:31:15] my heart
[1:31:18] sing.
[1:31:21] But until then
[1:31:25] joy I'll carry on until that day. Until
[1:31:32] the day
[1:31:34] my eyes behold the city.
[1:31:41] Until that day,
[1:31:44] God calls
[1:31:46] me and singing all the music. Amen. But
[1:31:49] until then, but until then
[1:31:54] my heart will go on singing.
[1:32:00] But until then,
[1:32:05] with joy I'll carry on
[1:32:11] until the day.
[1:32:15] My eyes behold the city.
[1:32:21] Until that day,
[1:32:24] God calls
[1:32:27] me home.
[1:32:31] Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:49] For the Lord God Almighty, he reigns.
[1:32:56] Hallelujah.
[1:33:03] Hallelujah.

[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Worthy is the lamb.
[1:34:05] You are holy. Let's raise our hands to
[1:34:08] the Lord.
[1:34:10] Or just worship him. Say, "Holy Lord,
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; are you the Lord
[1:34:17] Almighty?
[1:34:21] Worthy is the lamb.
[1:34:24] What is the lamb?
[1:34:31] Thank God. Thank you, Father." And the
[1:34:35] angels cry,
[1:34:38] "Holy
[1:34:42] all creation,
[1:34:46] holy
[1:34:49] you are high,
[1:34:53] glory,
[1:34:57] holy forever.
[1:35:04] King will sing.
[1:35:08] Glory
[1:35:11] to the king of kings.
[1:35:15] Glory.

[1:35:22] glory.
