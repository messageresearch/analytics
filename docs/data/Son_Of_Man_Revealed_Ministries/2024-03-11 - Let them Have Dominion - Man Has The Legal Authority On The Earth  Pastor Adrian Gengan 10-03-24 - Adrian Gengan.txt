amen amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen our soon coming King yes amen amen I if you're going to get surprised when you see the Lord Jesus amen but that's our expectation yes amen it's what we expecting in this time in the season is to see our Lord Jesus amen the Bible says when we see him we shall be like him am amen hallelujah in his own image and his own likeness amen praise the Lord amen let's turn to the Book of Genesis amen we've been dealing with the Book of Genesis and looking at the origins of man amen for those of you who didn't come Wednesday night you need to listen to that sermon amen maybe you already did amen hallelujah so there's no excuse why we shouldn't be up to date with the sermons amen because for some reason you miss church you can always catch up with it amen hallelujah it's important for you to catch up because if God is doing something amen we need to be in alignment with it amen amen amen if you can say Amen to that if we are not in alignment with that we'll be walking not functioning as one body amen but we need to grow together amen hallelujah so Genesis chapter 1 we reading there verse 26 amen and God said let us make make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so first God speaks it and then in 27 he does it so God created man in his own image in the image of God created him male and female created he them amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word amen praise the Lord amen may be seated amen let's turn to Psalm amen we read this on Wednesday we'll read it again Psalm 115 amen give you the scriptural backing so you know what we're talking about amen amen i' like to welcome you and uh also we have a visitor with us amen sister Rosa let's give a hand as we welcome up amen amen I believe uh brother Eric from Pastor Denzel's church is witnessing to her so she's here for Fellowship this morning pray amen the holy spirit will speak to you in some way amen hallelujah and I believe it's sister Michelle's birthday this morning let's give a hand let's thank the Lord amen wish you Happy Birthday the Lord continue to bless you and keep you amen so Psalm 115 verse 17 or verse 16 says very important these scriptures now you got to make a note of these scriptures because this becomes your Source your Lifeline when you are challenged you quote back these scriptures yes that's right amen remember when Jesus was challenged he quoted back the scriptures so you got to know the word amen I know you have excellent memories but you need to carry your pen and your pages because there's so much coming out and you need to make notes of it amen so it says the heaven even the heavens are the Lords yes amen amen hallelujah yes but the Earth but changes it right but the Earth ha he given to the children of men amen that's straight in line now with Genesis 1:26 there now when he said let them have dominion amen amen amen I don't know if you can say Amen to that amen now there's a quote that John Wesley John Wesley and St Austine made the statement it says here now we read John Wesley it seems that without God man cannot right man cannot do anything on the earth without God but then he goes to say and without man God will not yes do anything on the earth amen amen I'll read it again it seems that without God man cannot and without man God will not St Augustine said the same thing amen he says without God we cannot without us God will not amen so we see that these men understood something and this is in line to when we're dealing with prayer amen it seems that God cannot and without man God will not what is meaning is that amen that man has the legal Authority on the Earthen amen amen yes so you find here when God is making that statement let let them have dominion what is he doing how many of you know that's a law oh yes thank you Lord that's a law set forth in the earth when God said let there be light amen when God created the heavens and the Earth he set all the laws in motion now when he creates the Earth and all of creation he needs to set a law on the earth and he says let them have dominion Hallelujah am amen praise the Lord so let us make man in our image is what God Said right everybody agree amen the word image does not mean look like God did not make you to look like him amen amen hallelujah yes the Hebrew word means characteristics amen let them have the same characteristics let them have the same qualities of God Amen I have given you God's character amen I made you just like Father God oh yes thank you Lord amen the qualities of God is in you amen every one of you you are God's image amen hallelujah amen amen tell somebody I'm I have the character of God I of amen hallelujah they're going to remind you next time you fight with them now amen praise the Lord I have the character of God amen so the qualities of God is in you every one of you you are in God's image so the word likeness so he says image and likeness amen the word likeness in Hebrew means to function like so let us make this man with the characteristics the nature the essence of God and let him function like God oh thank you amen amen that means you function like God your father amen hallelujah any man that does not function like God he is malfunctioning what is that if we detail it any man that doesn't have the character of God any man that doesn't have the nature of God the life of God Amen he's not functioning like God he is malfunctioning amen hallelujah fear is a sign that you are malfunctioning because that's not being like God Amen worry is a sign that you are malfunctioning having doubt and fear and anxiety is a sign that you are malfunctioning amen praise the Lord and we know that perfect love has come down in this age Amen to cast out all fear amen amen the Capstone of Love is come down Amen to to unite with the body amen hallelujah are we building up to that edstone hallelujah amen so we see amen we in a time and season where perfect love has come to cast out all fear amen if you have worry like we saying you're malfunctioning you need to cast all your cares upon Jesus because he cares for you the reason you are Contin continually in a cycle is because you are trying to control the situation after the humanistic realm amen amen hallelujah whatever you've been taught in this life has told you that you need to take control of the situation that you need to handle the situation and worrying about the situation will solve the problem amen one of you will never solve the problem hallelujah amen hallelujah you know our lord Jesus speaks about this amen hallelujah and he says that worrying won't solve the thing amen hallelujah he says amen why don't you cast all your cares upon Jesus he says seek ye first the kingdom of God and righteousness and all of these things shall be added unto you amen you see the the biggest hindrance to our prayers is worry and fear because that puts doubt in our heart how can we pray being worried and fearful and saying oh God but when you release it to God and say lord it's not mine in the first place I release it to you in Jesus name amen hallelujah so when we read there why did God create us what is our primary purpose that God created us for if I had to ask you the question of most people they'll say the primary purpose we were created is for worship yes amen right that's what most people will say but what is the Bible saying remember before you were created God had angels and were the Angels worshiping him so can we say the primary purpose for Angels is worship the primary purpose for man according to Genesis 1 is to have dominion you see Traditions have kept us in certain ideas and certain boxes yeah that you can only do this yes but the message of the hour is coming to restore you back to your full Dominion amen you know if God doesn't restore me back to everything that Adam was before the fall then his Redemption is in part so I'm expecting his Redemption to be the full restoration of everything that Adam lost can you agree with that amen hallelujah we can't we can't understand uh and believe that animal was a God man on the earth he could speak to the winds he could speak to the waves that God gave him dominion over the fish of the sea the fire of the air and all the Beast of the field and then we want to be inferior man after God has done Redemption after he paid the price to redeem us back to our original condition amen you see many of us want to leave leave it to after the Rapture we don't want to do anything on the earth we want God to do all the work on the Earth but I have news for you this morning God will do nothing on the earth except he is in cooperation with man even the Bible says in Amos 37 surely the Lord will do God will do nothing except he reveal his secrets to his servant the prophets amen amen amen so God created us our primary purpose is somebody said Dominion Dominion you must have dominion in every area of your life thank you Lord every area of your life you must have dominion you are the God man yes you are the god daughter amen amen you must have dominion praise the Lord when sickness comes in your life you must have dominion when Trouble Comes you must have dominion when Temptation come you must have dominion amen amen you must have dominion unemployment comes you must have dominion somebody say Amen release your faith this morning amen means to so be it I agree with it hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen Satan want to keep you bound now amen Satan don't want you to have your Liberty this morning but I tell you the spirit of God wants you to be free this morning amen hallelujah you see we put a limit to God when we we put limits when we say Amen that God's idea of us is just to worship Him amen yes we must worship Him God's idea of us is to come and pray before him yes we must pray before God Amen but that's not our primary purpose amen some people believe that the purpose is to have a title in the church to have a position in the church amen and traditions of men have kept us amen if you can become a deacon maybe you become a pastor maybe you become an evangelist maybe you hold some title in the church that gives you your worth I tell you your wor is in Christ amen amen your worth is to have dominion over the Earth am thank you Lord you may not have a single position in the church amen but you stand as a son and daughter of God and have dominion thank you amen hallelujah most of the time we in our positions and our our situations because of wrong confessions you go and analyze the words that are coming out of your mouth and you'll see you keep confessing the negative things amen for example if your child is a drug addict you continually saying and admitting your child is a drug addict is echoing words amen because your words have life and you are basically putting a label on them and you carry the authority in this hour and you have told them that they are an [Music] addict you need to speak a word to reverse it and tell them my child is a son of a king amen and my child is fully delivered my child is liberated amen amen Lord the word need to come from your mouth amen hallelujah God don't interfere in man's business without invitation am does he say in his word if my people who are called by my name what's his name will humble themselves and pray what is prayer amen hallelujah prayer is a petition amen hallelujah when you make a petition you're petitioning according to the law if we have a constitution you know you petition the government according to the Constitution now God has given us his Constitution amen amen so when we make our petition our prayers we are asking God to come and we are petitioning according to the word amen because the sickness is not in alignment with God's word word because the word says by the stripes of Jesus we were healed so we are petitioning and I authority to come to the Earth we are giving him authority to come and have access over that sickness and to Deliver Us from that sickness amen yes thank you thank am how many of you know that God does things on the earth without man yeah God just does things without man God in the beginning he he said let there be an ark and then he brought the floods and then he said let all the animals go into the ark and then all the animals ran into the ark and he said let eight men go into the ark God won't violate his own law when he said let them have dominion over the Earth he will not violate his own law yes Lord sir amen we may think nothing about the rules we face that we set up but God is governed by his own laws God is governed by his word yes God won't do anything outside of his word so for God to have legal Authority in your life you must give him permission am that is why God is Jesus is teaching us to pray Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come I'm inviting you bring the kingdom your will be done in my life on Earth as it is in heaven you are giving God permission how many times we heard the prophet say that the holy spirit is a gentleman he won't just budge into your life but you've got to welcome him into your life amen amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord so the word dominion in Hebrew means to rule let them have dominion let them rule over my kingdom on the earth amen hallelujah it means to govern to master every situation to manage the the Master's resources Amen to be a governor to be a ruler to be have control over all the animal life fish life plant life I have control over your flesh as well amen amen hallelujah yeah that a beast right here before you can control the fish control this flesh control this flesh amen hallelujah have dominion over this flesh hallelujah praise the Lord so the authority given to men is necessary to understand what we are restored to when God created the Earth he gave the legal Authority in the earth to man he didn't say let us have dominion he first said let us make man but he didn't go on to say let us have dominion he said let them let them have dominion amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord I'm trying to take away some Amnesia amen amen you came through amen a perverted birth amen you came through a fallen birth so you forgotten what you were made like amen but the Thunder is coming this time to take away your Amnesia to make you known that you are part of God that you are Eternal as God is eternal amen thank you thank you Lord if I want to make a wooden desk or wooden Pulpit I must go and take wood to make this right the designer knows what he wants to make the designer knows what he wants to make yes so if God is saying I want to make man in my image and after my likeness what material must he use I'm talking about Genesis 126 now before God goes to the dust of the Earth yeah to make man he must use the same material of himself and God is spirit amuah and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit amen and in truth yes Lord amen hallelujah so God goes to his own self and the spirit your original Spirit rotates off of God Amen Hallelujah and man becomes a living soul amen praise the Lord amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah you're saying you're repeating yourself every week amen you're not believing me every week amen repetition is good yes you know what happens when you repeat something I want you to get into your spirit where when you say it it doesn't even sound unusual amen praise the Lord amen amen so when God speaks his word it becomes law God gave man Dominion on the Earth what was he doing he was shifting over the control of the earth over to man amen let them have dominion praise the Lord so God made a spirit being out of himself he made listen what I'm saying now God made a spirit being called man out of himself and he put the spirit being into a dirt body and he formed you out of the ground and called it man and God gave authority in the earth to a spirit being living in a dirt body that is the law therefore it means that the only creatures that have legal right to function in the Earth with authority are spirits with a body God took the Genesis 12 126 man and he put that Spirit In The Genesis 2 man yes yes right and the only one that has legal Authority is the man that is created that way a spirit living in a body the only one that has legal rights Authority on the earth is a spirit with a body amen hallelujah so if you don't have a body you have to exit the Earth everybody understand amen you know what I'm talking about if you if you if you got a spirit without a body then you are [Music] dead amen that's what it means your body is dead then your spirit can't operate on the earth you have to leave the Earth no matter how much you cry you can't cry because your body is dead tears only confined to the human body amen now we don't want I know some of you find your place in the scripture some you know we always say find your scripture and identify yourself with the scripture amen right right I don't want you to identify yourself with the scripture that says hey look I'm the dead in Christ you're sitting in church alive but you're on to function like you're dead in Christ amen you know somebody who's dead they don't say a [Music] word somebody was dead they can't even move they can't function right now I'm looking at some of you look like you're not even breathing you're sitting so still breathe God has given you life amen at least breathe in amen hallelujah you know how you say an amen you inhale and then you exhale amen some people feel like if they say Amen their mouth will get broken hey they can't say an amen you know what that is is possession possession because you don't have the victory to say amen hallelujah ask your neighbor did you hear me say Amen tell them did you hear me say amen hallelujah tell them wait it's coming I'm going to shock you now amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord so I'm telling you anything without a body is illegal on the earth any Spirit without a body is illegal and Spirits demon Spirits they are illegal in your body because they don't belong in your body amen yes you say I got a demon Spirit when sicknesses come upon you that's demon Spirits trying to possess you cancer is a Spirit come upon you amen all manner of sicknesses come upon you Jesus cast out Spirits when he was dealing with dumb dumb people he was casting out Spirits thank you Lord thank you Lord when this man was in Chains and they said he was mentally insane the diagnosis of medical field said that this man was mentally insane he's got a mental illness so they put him in chains on an island but when God comes on on the scene he exposes the root of it and he cast out a legion of demons amen yes Lord thank you Lord thank you amen now watch Spirits need bodies otherwise they are illegal on the earth so what do the spirits that are cast out ask Jesus we want to be legal on the earth at least let us go into the pigs amen I I'm trying to make you understand here this morning that you are spirit's with a body make your time on Earth effective amen yes amen amen be a god man on the earth have dominion on the earth have authority on the earth everything has been restored back to us in this time and this season we must rise up in the sign we must rise up in the season because we are called for such a time as this somebody say amen glory be to his name the spirits cried out let us go into the pigs the pigs had better sense and they didn't want to leave live with those demon Spirits so they said we rather go off the cliff and die than to live live with these demon spirits but yet men want to live with demon Spirits even the pigs didn't want to live with demon Spirits praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen amen thank you so no demon should be in our body any demon is living there illegal amen and you know what that is a squatter and you have a right this morning to tell him get off my property if it come to your family if come to squat in your own life I want you to use your mouth and tell him to get out I can't tell him to get out for you he's living in your house he's living in your body you have the legal right over your situation you exercise your god- given right this morning thank you Lord thank you hallelujah oh thank you Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord stop saying that oh stop believing that you're a negative person that you only speak negative start to change yourself start to change the atmosphere around you you know you create atmospheres amen stop confessing the negative stop only worrying stop only stressing about life stop having anxiety amen create the right atmosphere be a woman be a man full of Faith amen amen hallelujah you speak Amen in spite of the situation you control it God gave you the legal Authority amen amen or have you given up on Hope have you given up on faith amen is a situation gone on too long what are you doing to show God your faith what are you doing to call Heaven on the earth amen over your situation have you given up on it amen thank you Lord come on now Hallelujah we all praying oh God God come help me help me how is God going to help you not in this time and season God's not going to send the Angels Out of Heaven to help you God's Avenue [Music] is come on now God's Avenue is God works through amen praise the Lord I'm glad you know that amen praise the Lord amen how many of you believe that so we said Spirit without a body is illegal and Powerless on the earth a spirit without a body is illegal and Powerless on the earth okay let's let's let's magnify that thought is God a spirit yes yes okay understand what I'm saying now is God a spirit yes who has he given legal Authority on the earth so in order to do anything on the earth who must he connect with and that is what prayer is doing telling him have the legal Authority and God has the power we have the authority come on now says we've got the authority he says we don't have the power but we have the authority so prayer is asking God to come in with your power and interfere in my life some of us don't want anyone to interfere in our lives but you say Lord come into fear in my life let's go to first quot and see what the prophet is saying so I'm telling you what about the Holy Spirit then can the Holy Spirit do something that you don't allow him to do so here the prophet is saying evil spirits when it's not inhabited in a human body is powerless seemingly right then in another quote here what he says now very striking you got to understand this because you can't be saying Lord help me help me help me but then you kick the holy spirit out the holy spirit is powerless without you giving him permission you're going to read this now we got the now in that man was some Spirits you we just referen this right the man that was possessed in that man were some spirits that was cast out of the swine in gadera some of those poor people out there in that insane institution beating the heads against ped bar cells remember Devils never die die Devils always live but there will be a time where Devils will have to die they will become totally annihilated but now they are alive and they work from generation to generation upon human beings some of them is in the form of cancer some of them in the form of epilepsy some of them in the form of tuberculosis they get into the flesh but seemingly they are powerless until they get into a person amen amen so sometimes when they tell you you have a symptom of something and you go around telling everyone I have this I have this you are giving them legal right to attach themselves to your body now here's the important part they have to operate through a person which brings another thought that the Holy Spirit covers the earth but is almost helpless until it gets into you and to me yes amen God is depending on you and I the Holy Spirit the Earth is full of the spirit of God but it's poured out but it cannot operate until it comes into us we human beings to operate amen now what man of people it would be to shut the holy spirit's move what caliber of people must it be to make the Holy Spirit powerless later here isn't that the condition latest here is in they shut out the spirit now I'm asking you let's leave later see I'm asking you how many times have you told the Holy Spirit come back some other time and need to do this I need to follow my own will my own ambition you make him powerless help us Lord yes how possible amen praise the Lord let's go to Matthew Matthew 15:38 Amen Let let's hope I get the scripture right amen praise the Lord Matthew 15:38 so God is all powerful right oh sorry 13 this 1358 I think it is we know God is all powerful and he can do as he pleases will right listen to what Jesus could do and he did not many mighty works there because of there did Jesus the same one say all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me so why didn't he go by his own authority and just say Okay healed healed healed healed what does he need cooperation of man through faith oh yes what does the scripture say he did not many mighty thing works there because of their unbelief amen so God can't work in your life because of unbelief the Holy Spirit cannot help you because you don't want to surrender to the Holy Spirit you make the Holy Spirit powerless amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen remember these keys are to build you up amen yes now the prophet goes on to say so he says the Holy Spirit cannot operate until it comes in us we human beings to operate and the devil wants to take us over to operate under him so when he gets the mild form he starts to sin if he can hold him just in a righteous man a good man and just let him go ahead and try to be good like that if he can get all of him like that until he's dead that's just what he wants to do he's got him you see Satan wants to hold you in that position of being a religious person a good person until you dead wants to get you off the Earth because he knows you have no legal Authority then so they oppress you enough to make you feel like you're religious make you feel like you're a good church member until you're dead amen you understanding the quote he's got him because no matter how righteous you are how good you are how moral you are how clean you are how honest you are you'll never get to Heaven until you are born again amen what was our quotes we were reading Hallelujah only seed can be reborn not everyone can be reborn amen right you've got to be born you've got to be regenerated or there's not a way in the world for you to ever enter Heaven or ever to come to Christ amen he says here in the message who is God I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their Authority I'm afraid that the Holy Ghost born men don't realize the Authority or the authority that God has permitted to his church I'll give you the keys to the kingdom whatever you bind on Earth will be bound in heaven amen whatever you loose will be Loos what is what is that stop there whatever you bind on Earth will be bound God is asking you permission but you possess the authority on the earth amen God is saying hey you that possess the authority bind loose and I come with my power and back it up I give you Powers over serpents and all kinds of diseases everything nothing shall harm you exercise your faith Let it Loose let God have his way God will grant it to you amen how many if you want to exercise that all right the next time you see a coage you go and exercise your authority over it thank you Jesus amen let's start small amen praise the Lord I have given you Authority praise the Lord amen let us make man in our image you are in the god image you are in his likeness amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen here in this next quote we're going to read in the unfailing realities of God just to reiterate this God always likes to work through men amen how many of you agree with that amen how many of you can say Amen to that amen praise the Lord God always likes to work through men it's God's program to work through men do you believe that congregation says amen God works through man he made man his helper on Earth he made man a Lesser God than himself amen now we've been through that in the teaching lately in Genesis 1: 126 when he was El Ella Elohim the alls sufficient self-existing one and then in was attributes of the father son Holy Spirit not three God three officers in him that he was able to live in those dispensations he was a savior he was a king he was a God all these things displayed the selves it's the attributes of God and when God made man in his own image he put him on Earth as a Lesser God Jesus declared it when he said is it not written in your laws that you are Gods amen and if he called those Gods who whose the word of God came come to which are the prophets how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God he said they just couldn't understand it but man was put here with a dominion over the Earth he had everything under his control amen what Adam lost Jesus proved he had restored amen he stopped nature he raised the dead he done everything and the world is groan today the Bible said for the manifestation of the sons of God for God to get into his sh children again in realities to make things real amen amen and it stumbles the people you see here 10th of March God is trying to get the reality back into you amen hallelujah God is trying to get the reality back into you you have legal Authority on the earth amen praise the Lord now if Satan can't keep the truth from them he makes Fanatics out of them you see so you can go off on the Other Extreme as well so what is Satan's first goal to keep the truth away from you because he knows if you get the true Revelation he'll be powerless that's the quote so what's he saying here now if he can't keep the truth away from you did he keep the truth away from you somebody said no amen so then he makes Fanatics out of them throw them off on this side and that side and they get all kind of stuff the Bloods and oil sensation which is not even scriptural God has to find somebody he can trust ask yourself can God trust you amen ask yourself now can God trust me somebody there that he can have confidence in can have confidence in God that can believe him go has to find somebody he can put his confidence in and when he finds such a man are you such a one this morning amen has God found you this morning when God finds such a man he can put his confidence and his power in a man that will follow the road that will stay right on the map go right until until he comes to the place of power faith will lead him to that because he's got faith in the word it will lead him to the promise he lead him to power the power will lead him to the promise amen going to reiterate this now Hallelujah and now man was God's subject man is what God works through so if you are praying and asking God for something let's believe the quote now who's God going to work through oh but then now I I don't like my pastor you saying Lord speak to me speak to me now he's speaking to the pastor and you don't like the pastor but who God works through so if you are rejecting the answer coming from the five-fold who are you really rejecting because God works through amen if you are sick the Bible says call the Elders of the church let them anoint you with oil let them lay hands on you and pray if that is God's answer in the Bible and you don't exercise that and you're saying God you're not answering my prayer you're not answering my prayer God will only walk through his word amen God saying I already gave you the answer amen then you know in Mark 11:23 he says if you say to a situation be th removed be th cast into the sea don't doubt in your heart but believe the words that you have said you can have what you have said yes you see most of us don't have a problem with speaking and asking the problem is with believing our words because as time the time delay we don't get the answer when we see it unbelief set in reason set in doubt set in and then remember it must be according to God's time in season too your prayer is correct maybe your faith is correct but you got to wait for the time and season and until it opens up to you you got to remain faithful yes it took a man that know something about supernatural but God has such a man thank the Lord for that God has always got somebody he always has he had a man that could put his hands on aren't you glad that God got you in this hour the prophet is saying God always has a man God always has somebody so you are that somebody that God has this time amen praise the Lord praise the Lord now you know in Exodus there in the book of Exodus I told you God always connects with man right in the book of Exodus I think it's chapter 3 just want to read the opening uh scripture there opening verse amen you can throw it up on the screen as well amen praise the Lord so we see in Exodus 3 what happens Moses meets the pillar of fire right I'm trying to show you now that God wanted to work through Moses but what happened with Moses he slew the Egyptian because he moved out of God's time in season and then he ran away to the desert right pay attention now because you're going to benefit from this because because even though you may fall even though you may mess up even though you may be God of God's time and season God won't change the man amen thank you Lord God will wait for you amen oh somebody amen yes God's not going to discard you yes amen because of your faults and failures yes amen you are predestined for this hour hallelujah thank you thank you amen praise the Lord so here in Exodus chapter 3 at chapter 3 you'll see uh when Moses sees the bush right just want to read verse two because this is also important most people concentrate on the burning bush everybody agree that Moses saw a burning bush but most people don't even quote it the right way and here in verse two you'll read read it the right way and the angel of the Lord amen appeared unto him in a flame of fire yes so that was the angel of the Lord in the bush that is why the bush didn't burn Hallelujah the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed oh the devil better be wary amen because the angel of God walks with us the angel of God is here with us amen amen amen he's a consuming fire you know Satan is terrified of you thank you amen he's only acting like he's not scared of you but if you only recognize who you are as a son and daughter of God Satan is terrified of you am amen hallelujah praise the Lord now here very important I'm trying to get to is verse seven and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people who are in Egypt and I've heard they cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land unto a good land unto a large and land flowing with milk and Hy unto the place of the ites amorites perizzites evites and jebusites and Moses clapped his hand and said yes Lord go ahead and do it yay you're going to come and deliver them Moses yes Lord you what is God saying I am come down to do this yes but who has the legal Authority on the earth so he's trying to connect with the man amen will use his voice yes because God got the power but he needs a man yes to speak amen I come down to deliver them I'm going to lead you to this land so Moses could said yes brilliant plan Lord I'm going to sit back and watch you do it very next verse now says now therefore oh sorry where am I yeah verse 10 let's go to verse 10 come now so God just told him I'm going to do it then he says come now therefore and I will send thee amen amen I will send thee to Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt amen God in Moses Hallelujah yes God in Moses praise the Lord how many of you identify this is the first Exodus what we reading it's the first Exodus right I don't have time to preach this at length now I need to jump quickly here now amen praise the Lord amen okay let me give you all three Exodus while we here first Exodus he comes and he connects with a man amen now in order to fulfill and bring remember God wants to have the authority on the Earth but he can't do it without a body on the Earth Earth so what he couldn't fully Express his attributes now through all the prophets because they were Fallen men so he creates a body you know the Bible says the word became flesh amen and dwelt amongst us so God creates himself a body and he comes and he lives in that body amen everybody agree amen am so that he can have the legal Authority now now you don't have to rely on the prophets he's got a son on the earth amen perfect one one who didn't come by six birth one who didn't come by the Fall one is a perfect man on the earth so this man has Authority now God can do what he wants amen come on now somebody amen understand what I'm saying God don't have to beg men now because God now has a body on the earth am sir but now before the body came there are certain scriptures that must come to pass amen like Isaiah 7 a virgin must conceive so the angel comes to Mary and he tells Mary th are highly favored and he wants to make that scripture come to pass but a you a man on the earth the woman must give him legal Authority amen everybody understand what I'm saying he wants to bring his word to pass it's time for Jesus to be born but he must connect with somebody on the earth who opens up and gives him that legal Authority amen hallelujah amen and you'll find here that Mary says behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word amen and the angel Departed from her all he was waiting for was to give him the authority what was she saying use my whom amen gave him the authority and the angel of the Lord departs to go and bring forth the word so that the scripture can come to life so if in the first Exodus God had to connect with Moses to deliver the people the second Exodus he connects with Mary to bring forth Jesus amen amen in the Third Exodus he comes down in a cave amen amen and he says I come to tell you you're strange and misunderstood life amen amen I've come to tell you that you are take a a message of healing to the Nations as Moses was given two signs you shall be given two signs amen oh isn't this a perfect message amen he needs to connect with a man on the earth and what does the problem Prophet say the prophet is just like Moses oh I can't speak I can't do this I can't do that if you go read Exodus there two chapters the Lord is debating with Moses here how he can't do this and how he can't do that God is not worried about your incapabilities or how you see yourself God will use you whatever you give to him amen and remember God shows you knowing how you were made God knew that Moses was a stamer God knew that Moses amen couldn't do certain things in his own strength but God that was God's chosen vessel don't let people look down upon you you are God's chosen vessel in this time amen amen thank you Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you amen hallelujah praise the Lord so what happens here now Hallelujah so I showed you all three Exodus how he needs to connect with men of the earth to bring about the Exodus but here now going back to the story about Exodus there's an army coming after them I'm just trying to encourage you this morning here now there's an army coming after them after they leave Egypt everybody agree right now why do they leave Exodus because of the plagues Egypt Pharaoh allowed them to go because of the plagues now did God say Let There Be flies let the water turn to blood Let There Be frogs did God said it or did he use the legal Authority on the earth amen God used the legal Authority on the earth and Moses said let there be flies and let the water turn to blood and let you exercise it didn't Jesus say by the confession of your mouth Romans 10 19 amen if you believe in your heart confess with your mouth yes you shall be saved doesn't the Bible say death and life lie in the power of your tongue yes the legal Authority is in Man's Tongue amen so we can't be mute people we can't be quiet people yes amen we ought to know who we are we ought to speak what we want amen come on now people amen we need to speak what we want speak what we want to see the situation how we want it to be I'm speaking I'm speaking under legal Authority amen so we find here that after God uses Moses mouth to speak because remember he needs a legal Authority for his power to be displayed I hope that's being made clear to you amen praise the Lord now he comes and if you read here Amen in the book of Exodus they come to the Red Sea and they are basically trapped up because the sea is before them and Pharaoh's armies are behind them right now Moses does something here amen Moses does something just want to get to it praise the [Music] Lord in chapter 14 praise the Lord chapter 14 you got it Exodus CH 14 let's read from verse 12 just for context so now they're trapped they're surrounded the armies behind them the Seas before them is it not is not this the word that we did tell the in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than we should we should die in the wilderness now the people start to murmur now watch what Moses says and Moses said unto the people people fear not amen stand still and see the salvation of the Lord amen which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever amen amen hallelujah the one with the legal Authority starts to make a confession yes he goes on to say the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace now after he makes his declaration I want you to read in between the lines here now because you'll see the very next verse there it's saying that the Lord said the Lord is answering Moses which means after Moses makes this declaration Moses goes to God you heard the boss I just made there now I just told them stand still see the salvation of the Lord the Lord is going to fight for you the Egyptians you see you'll see them no more forever Lord how would you come back at my words then the Lord answers [Music] him wherefore cries thou to me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward amen who must he speak to Hallelujah amen amen speak to the ones who have the legal Authority oh Hallelujah speak to the on that have the legal Authority speak to the ones amen my sons speak to my daughters Amen Let Them realize they have the legal Authority amen speak and go forward amen hallelujah but lift up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on ground through the midst of the sea and behold amen so praise the Lord the Lord now is saying he's going to harden their heart that they're going to follow them praise the Lord now very quickly we're going to close now when they get to the other side they before they can start rejoicing what's happening notice what's happening you are praying for your problem your situation for God to open up a door God to open up the Red Sea make sure you don't leave it [Music] open because you find demon powers are coming after you hello whatever you bind on Earth is bound in heaven whatever is loosed on Earth is loosed in heaven Moses opens the Red Sea they all get on to the other side and when they look around they see Pharaoh and the Army advancing why the sea is open does God close the sea God now needs a legal Authority again and he tells him stretch water close the sea amen amen you see some of you cast things out some of you bind things and you don't cast it out he's giv you the authority to bind and to cast out and to tell it don't return to this house wonderful amen amen amen wonderful attach that don't return back yes because they follow instruction demon powers follow instruction don't return to this house again praise the Lord amen so what does it sound like Moses was praying to the Lord and the Lord tells him why you crying to me go and speak amen praise the Lord didn't David when he was going what was he doing making a boast he was making a boast before the people now David as well when he's going into fight gol what is he doing he's already boasting this day I'm going to going to kill you I'm going to give your body and I'm going to finish you off he's making his boast because he's got the legal Authority and it's up to God to come and back it up amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah how many of you know if doors are closed in your life you can speak now yes amen amen say Lord go into my week going into my month go into my year and open all doors amen amen you get caught up in traffic don't get frustrated and sway the drivers say Lord as I'm leaving today all Pathways will be clear there'll be no traffic Lord I want to listen to the sermon on the way to to work and I want to have a peaceful [Music] trip amen let all Pathways be clear I take control of the roads there'll be no accidents no demon powers trying to take me out out hallelujah praise the Lord no faith connect us with that amen amen you like traffic praise the Lord open up the door to your weak open up the door to your problem it lies in your mouth amen Lord I'm facing this obstacle I'm facing this problem but I'm speaking what I want I want it to come to an end right now I want amen restoration I want healing I want Deliverance whatever desire you control it through your mouth but you're are not speaking you have the legal Authority God has the power but he wants to come and connect with your legal Authority we already read the quote who can shut the Holy Spirit down praise the Lord so God told Moses except you give me permission I can't open the water I've got power you've got to give me permission I've Got The Power you got to give me permission amen praise the Lord so what what is prayer prayer is petitioning God and telling him according to your word what's written here I'm petitioning you and your your kingdom the government in your kingdom I'm petitioning your government to bring it to pass amen and because it's in the Constitution because it's in God's word he must bring it to pass amen the prophet of God will go on to say anytime the word of God is believed the same way in the right condition the right atmosphere in the same way same faith he's got to meet it on the same grounds God's word will not return void amen hallelujah some of you have to close things because you find yourself in a pattern how come you in a pattern the same thing that happened this time is happening this time that's a holding pattern demon powers you got to close that door maybe there's unforgiveness maybe there's unconfessed sin maybe there's something there that you haven't closed maybe there's hurt in relationship maybe business deals gone bad maybe unforgiveness you got to close Muslim if you don't amen those powers are going to trouble you you got to release the power of God to influence the Earth amen praise the Lord amen you know what God has secret weapons you are a secret weapon you are God's SEC secret weapon you possess the legal Authority on the earth amen amen how many of you want
