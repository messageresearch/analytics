[2:58] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[3:00] amen good to see every one of you amen
[3:03] hallelujah let's turn to our Bibles amen
[3:06] praise the Lord amen don't forget the
[3:10] combined meeting this evening at 4 pm
[3:13] amen the devil girl Secondary School
[3:16] Hallelujah
[3:18] amen how many of you were enjoying
[3:21] Abraham's Journey of Faith
[3:23] amen how do you know he's called the
[3:25] father of the faith for a reason amen
[3:28] because God was so pleased with him and
[3:30] his faith amen and no matter how much
[3:33] Satan tried to come in and mother plan
[3:35] and distort the plan and sowing see our
[3:37] reasoning and doubt God will Super
[3:40] Prevail God's word will never fail amen
[3:43] so we stopped on Genesis 14 let's just
[3:46] go through Genesis 15 and we go through
[3:48] a few things amen
[3:50] and I pray that the spirit of God will
[3:52] speak to our hearts
[3:53] amen
[3:56] something very unusual and
[4:00] the more you look into Abraham's life
[4:01] you can see the end time
[4:03] conditions that we are in
[4:05] because you find that
[4:07] in Chapter 11
[4:10] the in Babylon
[4:14] and this
[4:15] man is in one Accord the immunity and
[4:17] they're able to build a city
[4:19] and they're able to build a tower
[4:21] that it amazes them so much because
[4:24] where there's Unity men can achieve a
[4:26] lot
[4:28] so God even comes down the Bible says
[4:30] God came down to look at the city and
[4:31] the tower
[4:33] and God said look at what man has done
[4:35] with the imagination with the hope
[4:39] faith is the substance of things
[4:41] with the imagination with the hope they
[4:44] had in their heart
[4:45] because of unity look at what they're
[4:47] able to achieve let me now go and
[4:49] confuse the language so there's
[4:51] confusion in the land men are confused
[4:53] but then God calls Abraham now something
[4:56] is very strange God puts it into the
[4:58] heart of Abraham's father to leave the
[5:00] land of Earth if you read the closing
[5:02] chapter of 11 Abraham's father starts to
[5:06] take the journey first
[5:07] he takes a lot and he takes Abraham and
[5:10] Sarah and he starts on a journey and
[5:13] he's going to what and the Bible says
[5:15] that he has a desire to go towards
[5:16] Canaan
[5:19] now why I'm saying that wind just
[5:21] arrived here in the promised land in the
[5:23] Holy Ghost Luda had a desire to move on
[5:28] we're coming on a journey
[5:30] because after the Dark Age of the church
[5:32] amen was almost dead yeah
[5:35] but somebody had to start a journey and
[5:38] Abraham's father starts the journey but
[5:40] then he dies in Iran
[5:43] and that's when God comes and meets him
[5:45] amen hallelujah amen so what are we
[5:49] trying to show you the things that we
[5:50] are believing we are not just alone in
[5:52] it it's come from a rich life Heritage
[5:54] we're coming we can trace Our Roots all
[5:57] the way back to the early disciples amen
[5:59] when the Holy Ghost poured out we are
[6:01] the progression of their Church
[6:03] if you know that if Paul was alive Peter
[6:06] was alive and and all the apostles would
[6:08] be Fellowship in here
[6:11] this is a continuation of the same
[6:13] church
[6:15] amen hallelujah so Genesis 15 let's just
[6:19] read and then we can be seated
[6:22] so we know that in 14 now he means the
[6:24] the mystery of God is revealed he needs
[6:26] Melchizedek right and after these things
[6:28] the word of the Lord came to Abram in a
[6:30] vision so remember his name is Sir Abram
[6:32] and saying fear not Abram I am thy
[6:35] Shield
[6:36] that's protection armor and defense
[6:40] and exceeding great reward now you only
[6:43] reward somebody if they do something
[6:45] right but I am your shield and I'm your
[6:48] reward but not just any reward I'm an
[6:50] exceeding great reward to you that's how
[6:53] we feel about the Lord and Abraham said
[6:55] Lord God what will thou give me seeing I
[6:57] go childless and the steward of my house
[7:00] is this Eliza of Damascus
[7:04] and Abram said behold to me thou has
[7:07] given no seed and lo one born in my
[7:09] house is mine here
[7:11] you see why we have to ask the Lord
[7:13] these things we've got to ask us
[7:16] Abraham didn't stay quiet he's asking
[7:18] the Lord and behold the word of the Lord
[7:20] came unto him saying this shall not be
[7:23] thine Heir but ish that shall come forth
[7:26] out of thine own bow shall be in thy ear
[7:30] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[7:32] look now toward heaven and tell the
[7:34] Stars so previous chapter he told him
[7:36] look at the Sand
[7:38] now he tells him if you're tired of
[7:39] looking at the sand look at the stars so
[7:42] from the dust of the Earth to the Stars
[7:44] we've got to look
[7:47] if you are able to number them and he
[7:50] said unto him so shall I see it be
[7:54] and he believed in the Lord
[7:57] and he counted it unto him for
[7:59] righteousness
[8:00] you see what belief can do
[8:04] amen remember Mark 9 23 now Jesus said
[8:08] unto him if thou can't believe
[8:10] all things are possible amen yes that's
[8:13] what Abraham is doing now he's
[8:15] exercising his faith he believed in the
[8:18] Lord and he counted into him for
[8:20] righteousness and he said unto him I am
[8:23] the Lord that brought thee out of the
[8:24] Earth the chaldees to give thee this
[8:27] land
[8:28] Amen to inheritance amen may the Lord
[8:32] and bless you to the reading of his word
[8:33] you may be seated
[8:36] praise the Lord amen
[8:40] now if we just look at and just focus in
[8:42] on that few verses that we read there
[8:46] and we try and type it in without any
[8:47] time that we are living in now
[8:50] amen
[8:52] Abraham is saying I am childless
[8:55] I don't have the formed what image in me
[8:59] I'm supposed to be in the Statue of a
[9:01] perfect man
[9:05] amen
[9:06] I supposed to achieve all of these
[9:09] things
[9:10] but all I can see is Brandon
[9:15] amen
[9:17] of all things
[9:21] is that the condition of the message
[9:24] I Elevate Brandon because he operated at
[9:27] this level
[9:29] amen Elisa remember Eliza is the type of
[9:32] me and child Prophet yes remember what
[9:34] the prophet was asking the Lord to show
[9:35] him the scripture he flipped Through the
[9:37] Bible and the Lord showed him
[9:39] the servant going forward to get Isaac
[9:41] so he is typing Eliza in the Bible
[9:44] must he be the only one to come to full
[9:47] maturity is the question I'm asking
[9:55] his wave sheep was waved before us
[9:58] he came to full maturity yes yes amen he
[10:02] spoke to the winds he spoke to the storm
[10:04] he spoke to the fish he spoke to the
[10:07] Raging Bull he spoke to Flying piece he
[10:10] spoke his sister out of existence amen
[10:12] yes his body changed when he was walking
[10:14] with the Lord
[10:16] his wife sheep was waved before us
[10:20] but is he the only one
[10:23] seeing that I go childless Lord
[10:27] is what Abraham is asking
[10:30] is he the only one that's going to
[10:31] inherit all the end time promises
[10:36] because here the Bible says
[10:40] Abraham said you have given me no seed
[10:42] and low one born in my house his mine
[10:45] air so he's Abraham is Brandon born part
[10:47] of the household of God is he also a son
[10:50] of God
[10:51] so he's also born and a part of us
[10:53] amen but should he be the only heir
[10:57] hmm
[10:58] or is he the one that was way before the
[11:02] people
[11:03] the first fruits of the others to say if
[11:06] you lay in the presence of the son
[11:08] you can also come to full maturity amen
[11:10] amen amen you can also operate as the
[11:13] son of God
[11:15] amen amen
[11:18] and yes
[11:20] sir wait waiting in the sunlight to come
[11:22] to full maturity but how many of us have
[11:24] walked away from the sunlight
[11:27] of the word
[11:29] I know because I've got time laying in
[11:31] the sunlight of the word
[11:33] to come to full maturity
[11:35] that's why we are childless
[11:38] amen
[11:41] so ask ourselves the question now using
[11:45] the scripture what about our maturity
[11:47] what about our inheritance Lord amen I
[11:50] see Brenham and I Rejoice because I see
[11:52] my potential
[11:53] when a man is fully surrendered to God
[11:55] how you can use him
[11:57] amen but he prophesied things about me
[12:01] amen and he told me that I can operate
[12:04] in this level and this anointing
[12:06] amen hallelujah
[12:09] now I want you to know that God has not
[12:12] forgotten about you
[12:15] amen God has not forgotten about you you
[12:18] see as the chapters are progressing if
[12:20] we don't if we don't notice it years are
[12:23] going by
[12:24] without the promise being fulfilled but
[12:27] God has not forgotten his promise
[12:30] the thing that you've been trusting the
[12:32] Lord for the thing that you even believe
[12:34] in the Lord for God has not forgotten
[12:36] about you amen thank you Lord amen amen
[12:39] Keep Holding On keep holding to the
[12:42] promise
[12:43] amen don't deviate now now's not the
[12:46] time for unbelief and reasoning to come
[12:48] in amen I want you to know God is Not
[12:50] Forgotten
[12:52] amen you have may have had all the
[12:54] experiences like Abraham we just started
[12:56] in 12 13 14. he had early experiences
[13:00] but time has lapsed now
[13:02] God comes to reconform his word
[13:05] I am your defense oh yes I know a great
[13:08] reward amen you may feel childless
[13:11] but God is saying one out of your own
[13:13] vows
[13:15] the whole life must come out of you yeah
[13:17] amen Christ's life must come out of you
[13:20] amen
[13:22] amen hallelujah we Rejoice to see
[13:25] Christ's Life coming out of Paul out of
[13:27] Luther out of Wesley
[13:30] but what about out of you amen Christ's
[13:32] life must come out of your own voice
[13:34] vows amen
[13:37] amen now in verse 8 the Lord comes down
[13:39] he reconfirms his promise and he tells
[13:41] him Lord God whereby shall I know that I
[13:44] shall inherit it
[13:45] how do I know that I shall inherit these
[13:48] things so here the Lord gives him amen
[13:50] he takes five animals so anything that
[13:53] you inherit in this life takes by
[13:55] g-r-a-c-e
[13:58] anything you inherit in this life it's
[14:01] by the grace of God
[14:03] Amen to our god asked him to take an
[14:05] effort he asked him to take a coat he
[14:07] asked him to take a ram amen a turtle
[14:09] dove and a young pigeon amen that's why
[14:12] if a goat amen a ram a turtle dove and a
[14:17] young pigeon
[14:18] and he tells him to divide it in the
[14:20] midst of him and then the Lord comes
[14:22] amen now amen in the midst of that
[14:25] before the Lord comes as a consuming
[14:27] fire to consume it
[14:30] Abraham goes into a Daydream or
[14:32] Nightmare and God shows him things that
[14:34] are to be
[14:35] and he shows him how you see he's going
[14:38] to go into captivity in Egypt
[14:40] right so amen let's just go to our
[14:42] quotes there and just maybe tie this up
[14:44] here so my subtitle here this morning is
[14:47] nothing can stop God's plan for your
[14:49] life
[14:52] nothing gets up God's plan maybe you've
[14:55] forgotten about the plan but God has not
[14:56] forgotten about it
[14:58] amen
[14:59] so yeah we read amen we can go to slide
[15:02] number four there
[15:03] he says we are families
[15:06] every family in here is custom to that
[15:09] sometimes everything will run fine for
[15:12] you
[15:12] for years
[15:14] then all at once you little spell where
[15:16] everything goes wrong
[15:18] we see it many times here down here in
[15:20] the South when it rains you pause you're
[15:22] going through a nighttime that's what
[15:24] Abraham was having in our vision of
[15:25] night time yeah
[15:27] when the children of Israel will go down
[15:28] into Egypt he says then there's a day
[15:31] break and then at night time everything
[15:33] runs in continuity not to go to slide
[15:37] true there you'll see the scripture to
[15:39] everything there is a season
[15:42] anytime so there's time and season for
[15:45] everything
[15:46] amen
[15:47] for every matter or purpose under heaven
[15:52] for everything there is a season there
[15:54] is a time and God has a great clock the
[15:57] next slide amen God has a great clock
[15:59] and he has a picture this is the prophet
[16:02] now and he is moving the club to get the
[16:04] picture in life
[16:08] amen
[16:09] God is moving his truck
[16:11] to get the picture that he has in his
[16:13] mind to bring the picture to pass
[16:16] you may think the clock is out of sync
[16:18] you may be thinking the clock needs you
[16:20] batteries but God's clock is never out
[16:23] of time God's blood doesn't need
[16:25] batteries amen amen amen
[16:28] and God has a picture you may not like
[16:31] the picture but God has a picture of you
[16:34] and the image he wants to bring you to
[16:37] amen amen and if you refuse to obey that
[16:40] voice that's calling you to align with
[16:42] the picture
[16:43] then you ask him for serious trouble
[16:45] because you've got a child of God if
[16:47] you're a son and daughter of God he is
[16:49] going to whoop you into place
[16:50] he's going to make you go to Great
[16:52] trials
[16:53] through great persecution he's going to
[16:56] let a will swallow you up because you're
[16:58] running from Nineveh
[17:00] amen
[17:02] but the property is saying again nothing
[17:05] can stop it
[17:07] amen say thank you Lord nothing can stop
[17:09] my blessings nothing has stopped me from
[17:12] coming into your image amen it's going
[17:14] to be just exactly according to what God
[17:16] said it would be that's why we don't
[17:20] have to get jealous when other people
[17:21] are prospering when other people are
[17:23] progressing in this life even
[17:25] spiritually we don't have to get jealous
[17:27] because my Lord has been apportion to me
[17:29] and according to God's time and season I
[17:32] shall receive it amen you don't even
[17:35] know that other people may be jealous of
[17:37] what God is doing for you but yet you
[17:40] are jealous of one another who God is
[17:41] doing for other people don't be jealous
[17:44] the bottle is fitly framed together
[17:46] enjoy one another's blessings amen
[17:49] hallelujah enjoy one another's gifts
[17:54] praise the Lord amen hallelujah
[17:58] amen so the thing needed we know is the
[18:01] Holy Ghost
[18:02] amen how many of you know the thing
[18:04] needed is the Holy Ghost
[18:06] God will give us the Holy Spirit to
[18:09] actually destroy sin out of our life
[18:11] [Music]
[18:13] so if there's any sin there then you
[18:16] know now there's a check mark there Lord
[18:19] do I have the Holy Ghost
[18:21] it's coming to utterly destroy sin
[18:24] and nothing can stop the church
[18:28] if the church is stopped it's because
[18:30] they left the Holy Ghost
[18:32] they've gone after their own program but
[18:34] nothing has stopped the move of God
[18:36] nothing can stop the program of God if
[18:38] it's LED of the Holy Ghost
[18:40] God Amen they may call you frenetic they
[18:43] may call you simple to protect the Bible

[19:11] rejection a lot of what the persecution

[21:27] they are forced to be reckoned with and
[21:30] he resistible Force yes
[21:32] amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah
[21:36] amen so we find God confirms his word by
[21:39] coming and consuming the sacrifice and
[21:42] he confirms it by grace
[21:44] a sacrifice of Grace
[21:46] amen
[21:48] so yeah you find amen that's how the
[21:49] chapter closes there with a night dream
[21:52] and then the Lord tells him about the
[21:55] Canaanites camsites so yeah in list 10
[21:58] Nations 10 Nations that is going to give
[22:02] them now imagine Abraham walking through
[22:04] the land why did the God tell him I'm
[22:06] going to be a shield he's walking
[22:07] through a land that's fully inevited by
[22:09] other nations
[22:13] don't tell them this but when they say
[22:16] this was our land first they actually
[22:17] absolutely right
[22:21] Abraham walked into their territory and
[22:23] God said I'm going to give you all of
[22:24] this
[22:27] right
[22:29] so he had to walk the way
[22:32] and God was going to give him all
[22:34] and he said I'll drive all of these
[22:36] people out yeah
[22:37] because I have got a you in my mind oh
[22:40] man so yeah we finally chapter 16 now
[22:43] chapter 16 he's wear doubt and reasoning
[22:46] comes in
[22:49] amen chapter 16 he's wear doubt and
[22:52] reasoning comes into the story and if
[22:55] you read the story it's almost identical
[22:57] to Genesis chapter 3. where the serpent
[23:00] comes in the Garden of Eden and souls
[23:03] doubt and reasoning and how does doubt
[23:05] and reasoning come in Chapter 3 of
[23:07] Genesis through the
[23:09] Through The Who
[23:12] through the woman
[23:13] amen
[23:15] and watch our doubting reason comes in
[23:17] in chapter 16 of Genesis through the
[23:19] woman
[23:21] now Sarah Sarah Abram's wife babe no
[23:25] children
[23:26] and she had an animated Egyptian whose
[23:28] name was Hagar and Sarai said to Abram
[23:32] Beyond now the Lord had restained me
[23:34] from bearing
[23:36] I pretty go in unto my maid that it may
[23:41] be that I may obtain children by her
[23:44] and Abram after the voice of Sarah
[23:48] and Adam listened to the voice of Eve
[23:51] amen same story
[23:54] it must be the same because I Adam and
[23:56] Eve was the first family God chose
[23:58] now after the flood God chooses a new
[24:00] family
[24:01] and he comes with the same reasoning
[24:03] amen
[24:05] trying to make them fall
[24:06] [Music]
[24:11] and some of you know I was asking my
[24:13] wife this the other day we're having a
[24:15] trivial questions and I was asking how
[24:17] many wives did Abram have
[24:19] so we know Abraham had Sarah and yeah
[24:24] how many wives so when Sarah died then
[24:26] he remarry so yeah
[24:28] I'm bringing this point for a reason
[24:30] watch how the Bible writes it and Sarah
[24:32] Abram's wife took AGA amid the Egyptian
[24:35] and Abram at 12 10 years in the land of
[24:38] Canaan
[24:39] I gave her to her husband Abram to be
[24:42] his wife
[24:45] so you see you men that's sleeping
[24:46] around with women that's your wife
[24:49] [Music]
[24:51] God sees it as your wife
[24:54] hello
[24:56] we woke up here in the 20th century and
[24:58] you're thinking the only time you get
[25:00] married is because of an English
[25:01] traditional ceremony
[25:05] I don't know if you know the English
[25:06] traditional ceremony didn't exist
[25:08] maybe a couple hundred years ago your
[25:11] white wedding dresses and things
[25:13] hello these were Eastern Eastern
[25:17] marriages
[25:18] you go find when when Rebecca comes to
[25:21] meet Isaac they're just going to the
[25:22] tent and she became his wife
[25:25] they didn't go have a big uh wedding as
[25:28] time progressed they got into more
[25:30] traditional and they started to have
[25:31] winnings and all of these things
[25:34] amen but don't forget my point now
[25:37] you young men you keep yourself pure
[25:42] you young woman you keep yourself pure
[25:44] don't think you can go around sleeping
[25:46] around
[25:47] God will hold you accountable for it
[25:50] amen God is a word his word is he
[25:52] standard
[25:53] and we must keep his word we have no
[25:56] excuse because we are growing up with
[25:57] truth
[25:59] truth is presented to you all the time
[26:01] so you're gonna have to make these
[26:03] choices no matter how enticing sin may
[26:05] seem don't get caught up into it amen
[26:09] you keep yourself undefiled so here you
[26:11] find in verse 3 it tells you that 10
[26:13] years have passed
[26:15] since the Lord called him
[26:17] so after 10 years voice of doubt and
[26:19] reasoning comes in
[26:21] after how many years now in the message
[26:23] the voice of doubting reasoning is
[26:25] coming in
[26:26] amen
[26:28] Hallelujah and Sarah Abram's wife took
[26:31] aega so she gives him to be his wife and
[26:33] he went in to aega and she conceived and
[26:36] when she saw that she had conceived her
[26:38] mistus was despised in her eyes
[26:52] now she's saying my wrong be upon you
[26:55] why you listen to me
[27:00] why did you listen to me my wrong be
[27:03] upon you
[27:03] [Music]
[27:05] I have given my maid into thy bosom and
[27:08] when she saw that she had conceived I
[27:09] was despised In Her Eyes the law checked
[27:12] between me and thee
[27:13] but Abram said to Sarah
[27:16] Biol this is your maid they see the
[27:19] pushing the blame back and forth this is
[27:21] your mate
[27:23] you do it as you please you see the same
[27:25] story in Genesis there and that's what
[27:27] I'm trying to show you the back and
[27:28] forth blame back and forth blame
[27:31] so she fled now when she flees
[27:35] amen
[27:37] okay just stay I want you to know God
[27:39] does not need our help to bring the
[27:41] promise to pass yes Sarah thought God
[27:44] needed our help
[27:46] right
[27:47] Sarah thought God needed her help to
[27:50] bring the promise to pass I love God my
[27:53] poor husband is here having so much of
[27:55] Faith he's believing it he's got me
[27:56] making so much of booties and clothing
[27:58] here I've got all Wardrobe full
[28:01] [Music]
[28:05] let me help God bring the promise to
[28:07] pass my body is old now 10 years
[28:11] 65 and now she's 75. Abraham is 85. 75
[28:17] years huh I'm past childbearing now
[28:21] I got a young Egyptian girl yeah
[28:24] maybe the Lord will use her to bring the
[28:27] promise to pass
[28:30] now in all of this God is silent God
[28:33] could have stopped them
[28:35] God could have come down and stopped
[28:37] them but God is silent
[28:40] amen God has a provided way and then
[28:42] there's a permissive way
[28:44] you may be thinking you got away with
[28:46] whatever you've done
[28:48] and you're walking in God's permissive
[28:50] way
[28:51] amen God will still have the last saying
[28:54] amen so God does not need our help to
[28:57] bring the promise to pass just because
[28:59] 10 years or 50 years has gone by 60
[29:02] years and no sign of the promise don't
[29:04] let unbelief come into the church don't
[29:06] let reasoning come into the church the
[29:08] reasoning will come in through subtility
[29:10] the reasoning will look so reasonable
[29:12] the reasoning amen but wait until God's
[29:15] time and season
[29:17] amen because when you go over to Genesis
[29:20] 22 verse 2
[29:23] now whose son is this who's Ishmael
[29:28] who's Ishmael whose son is he who's the
[29:31] father
[29:34] come on now
[29:36] who is the father of Ishmael
[29:40] okay but in Genesis chapter 22 God tells
[29:44] verse 2 God tells Abraham take now thy
[29:48] son thine only son
[29:50] Isaac
[29:53] because in reality Abraham had only one
[29:56] son
[29:58] but Abram
[30:00] and Ishmael
[30:02] amen amen amen yes
[30:06] remember Abram is the old nature yes
[30:09] Abram why does the name represent your
[30:13] nature
[30:14] Abram doesn't have a new name
[30:19] so Abram's son is Ishmael but in Genesis
[30:23] 22 verse 2 he tells him take now thy
[30:25] only son Isaac but watch here God is
[30:28] mindful of all things they didn't even
[30:30] know what the child the the one that's
[30:32] in agar's womb the name of it but the
[30:34] angel of the Lord comes to this woman
[30:36] and tells her the name of the child yes
[30:40] yeah
[30:42] so you'll find in chapter seven you'll
[30:43] find you can go and read it how the
[30:45] angel of the Lord comes and finds it by
[30:47] the function of water in the wilderness
[30:48] and he tells her to go back to your
[30:50] mistress
[30:51] amen I need the child to be delivered
[30:54] because it's Abram's seed now God don't
[30:57] believe in abortion yeah yes amen
[31:00] hello yeah
[31:02] if she had stayed in the wilderness she
[31:04] would have perished she would have died
[31:07] and Abraham's seed Abram's seed would
[31:09] have died with her God says go back
[31:13] go back to your place of Refuge go back
[31:16] to your master no
[31:18] and let the child come forth let them
[31:20] take care
[31:21] of you right and here you'll find that
[31:24] God tells him now
[31:25] in verse 11 the angel of the Lord said
[31:27] unto us behold Thou Art my child thou
[31:29] shall be a son and shall call his name
[31:31] Ishmael that sounds so familiar to the
[31:33] angel that spoke to Mary
[31:35] you are a child you shall be a son and
[31:37] his name Shall be Called Ishmael because
[31:39] the Lord had hurt land Affliction and he
[31:41] will be a wild man his hand will be
[31:43] against every man and every man's hand
[31:45] against him and he shall dwell in the
[31:46] presence of his Brethren and she called
[31:49] the name of the Lord that speak unto her
[31:51] thou God sees me for she said
[31:53] have I also you looked after him that
[31:56] seeth me wherefore the well was called
[32:01] because it was between kadish and Berea
[32:14] so he's now 86 years old he's got a son
[32:19] foreign
[32:23] and he takes care of the Sun
[32:25] and you'll find in the next chapter
[32:27] Abram is now 90 years old how many years
[32:31] have passed
[32:34] amen
[32:36] four years past
[32:39] in chapter 17. four years passed the boy
[32:42] is four years old and the Lord appears
[32:45] unto Abram and says I am almighty God
[32:48] walk before me and be thou perfect
[32:50] and I will make a covenant that's a
[32:52] treaty in agreement or a promise between
[32:54] me and thee and multiply the exceedingly
[32:58] and Abram fell on his face and God
[33:00] talked with him as for me be all my
[33:02] covenantes with thee and thou shall be a
[33:04] father of many nations amen
[33:07] right now here's the name change neither
[33:11] shall thy name anymore be called Abram
[33:14] but thy name shall be Abraham
[33:17] for a father of many nations have I made
[33:20] thee amen amen amen
[33:24] Hallelujah
[33:25] and I will make the exceeding fruitful
[33:28] and I will make nations of thee and King
[33:30] shall come out of thee and I will
[33:32] establish my Covenant between me and
[33:33] thee and thy seed after thee in their
[33:36] generations for an Everlasting Covenant
[33:38] to be a god unto thee and to thy seed
[33:40] out to thee and I will give unto thee
[33:43] and to thy seed after thee the land
[33:44] wherein Thou Art his stranger all the
[33:47] land of Canaan for an everlasting
[33:49] position and I will be their God
[33:52] so yeah we know what is the Covenant
[33:56] given now God says to Abraham that shall
[33:58] keep so straight away it goes to calling
[34:00] him Abraham in verse 9. God said you
[34:03] changed your name and I'm calling you
[34:04] Abraham from now on
[34:06] Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore
[34:08] and I heal after thee in their
[34:10] generation this shall be my Covenant
[34:12] which you shall keep now every man child
[34:14] among you shall be circumcised
[34:16] now we know circumcision is the type of
[34:18] love
[34:19] Holy Ghost circumcision right so God is
[34:22] giving him a new name and is giving him
[34:24] the Holy Ghost
[34:27] you shall circumcise your flesh of your
[34:29] foreskin it shall be a token of the
[34:31] Covenant between me and you and
[34:33] you know eight days old every man child
[34:35] in your generation that is born in your
[34:37] house shall be brought brought into
[34:40] and anyone that is not circumcised shall
[34:43] be Cast Away that's how that verse ends
[34:45] right because you're broken by Covenant
[34:47] you'll see that in verse 14. thou shall
[34:49] cut off the soul from my people now
[34:54] God doesn't only change Abraham's name
[34:58] this is very important now because if
[35:01] you go and read from chapter 12
[35:03] nowhere that's how unbelief came in now
[35:06] because Satan will always try and find a
[35:07] point of reasoning
[35:09] nowhere from chapter 12 God does God
[35:13] reveal to Abram through who the seed
[35:17] will come
[35:21] he doesn't name Sarah anywhere before
[35:25] hello
[35:28] he only tells him Abraham out of your
[35:30] loins out of you shall come forth out of
[35:32] you out of you so Sarah
[35:35] when she was reasoning did God say that
[35:38] Abram shall have a son
[35:40] maybe it won't be through you
[35:42] because he never mentioned the woman
[35:44] maybe it'll come through aega but now
[35:46] God is specific
[35:48] God is identifying the paining ground
[35:51] God is identifying the woman
[35:54] in church yeah come on I'll follow the
[35:57] continuity after the new name and the
[35:59] Holy Ghost God will identify you as the
[36:01] bride and the wife of the Lord Jesus
[36:03] Christ through whom he's going to
[36:05] manifest his life amen amen
[36:11] yeah we find that in verse 15 God said
[36:13] to Abram ask for Sarah thy wife Thou
[36:16] shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah
[36:19] shall be her name and I will bless her
[36:22] amen amen and give thee a son also of
[36:26] her
[36:28] I will bless her and she shall be a
[36:30] mother of Nations so not only is Abraham
[36:33] a father of Nations amen Sarah is mother
[36:36] of Nations
[36:40] Hallelujah
[36:42] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[36:45] not only is he King of Kings but she is
[36:48] Queen of Queens
[36:51] king of people shall be of her then
[36:54] Abram fell on his face watch now
[36:57] because man is just being man
[37:00] and Abram fell on his face and laughed
[37:05] shall a child be born unto him that is a
[37:08] hundred years old
[37:10] and shall server that is 90 years old
[37:13] babe
[37:14] now watch what God what Abram is
[37:16] offering God Abram said unto God oh that
[37:18] Ishmael might live before thee
[37:22] he became the apple of Abram's eye
[37:24] Abram's eye
[37:26] Abram was settling for this to be his
[37:28] inheritance
[37:33] now God is reconfirming to which woman
[37:37] and God said Sarah thy wife
[37:42] amen let me tell you this from a zooming
[37:46] out a bit
[37:48] the church world thinks that God is
[37:50] producing his life through
[37:51] denominationalism
[37:53] they all over television
[37:56] they all over the world proclaiming the
[37:58] name of Jesus
[38:00] but God is saying through this bride
[38:02] through this Pride I will reproduce my
[38:05] life amen amen stop telling me about
[38:08] denominations I'm not interested in that
[38:10] life of Ishmael it's a wild Nation yeah
[38:13] Hallelujah
[38:15] amen
[38:17] refocus Abraham
[38:19] Sarah thy wife amen and Jesus has the
[38:23] wife
[38:24] amen other people are claiming his name
[38:26] Agar was claiming Abram's name that's my
[38:30] husband I have a son with him
[38:32] amen they are claiming the name of Jesus
[38:34] they are performing great signs and
[38:36] wonders Miracles and saying the name of
[38:38] Jesus may God blessed famous names there
[38:40] but God is saying I have one woman amen
[38:44] the marriage of the Lamb is kind and his
[38:46] wife has made himself ready yes I am one
[38:49] woman and Sarah is a meme
[38:52] hey amen
[38:54] Sarah thy wife shall be the son indeed
[38:56] and thou shall call his name Isaac
[38:59] so God is telling them the name
[39:01] God knows your children before you name
[39:04] them
[39:05] yes
[39:07] God knows if you're gonna have children
[39:09] what your son's names are
[39:15] is acting so shy
[39:24] God knows yes
[39:28] God even knows the person he's looking
[39:30] down God even knows the person you're
[39:32] going to marry Say Amen
[39:34] amen
[39:36] you want me to say that for you too God
[39:38] knows the person you're going to get
[39:39] married to
[39:42] come on you're supposed to say Amen
[39:45] reveal it to me Lord
[39:50] you see your father wasn't slapped
[39:53] you must get some chips from me
[39:55] hey
[40:00] amen praise the Lord Give the Lord a
[40:02] good night for praise the Lord praise
[40:04] the Lord
[40:05] [Applause]
[40:07] amen so God is reconforming Abraham get
[40:10] your vision back into Focus
[40:12] you got into wild imaginations here
[40:15] you're trying to offer me Ishmael
[40:17] and telling me to bring the promise to
[40:19] him
[40:20] I am going to use Sarah
[40:24] you think you think that promise will
[40:26] still come to us
[40:28] 60 The Profit you think in principal
[40:30] Army you should put children I think
[40:31] it'll still come
[40:33] amen
[40:40] how do I know it's here yeah yeah amen
[40:44] it's here already
[40:46] amen praise the Lord amen that's
[40:47] voicemail
[40:49] I hear what you're telling me about
[40:51] Ishmael I have blessed him and I'll make
[40:53] him fruitful and will multiply him
[40:54] exceedingly twelve princes shall he
[40:57] begin and I will make him a great nation
[40:58] and but my Covenant will I establish
[41:01] with Isaac see my Covenant will be with
[41:04] Isaac with Sarah again re-emphasizing
[41:07] the woman the bending ground
[41:10] Sarah shall be unto thee at the set time
[41:12] in this time and season
[41:15] next year
[41:16] and he left off talking with him and God
[41:19] went up from Abraham
[41:23] amen
[41:25] praise the Lord
[41:26] so yeah God Abraham goes now and he
[41:29] circumcises we know he circumcises ishma
[41:33] and he circumcises all his servants and
[41:35] he gets circumcised and he's 99 years
[41:37] old amen and here they go
[41:41] following that sign of circumcision they
[41:44] are going now to receive the baptism of
[41:45] the Holy Ghost
[41:47] amen they're following now what God is
[41:50] saying now God is telling him hey come
[41:52] on now now at 99 years old
[41:56] at 199 one is 100 one is uh
[42:00] one is hundred and what's the other one
[42:03] it's 10 years difference right
[42:06] so now
[42:07] it's impossible
[42:10] so the body needs to change
[42:13] the body needs to change yes yes
[42:17] because in the physical state they can't
[42:20] bring for children
[42:21] so their body must change
[42:25] that's when now Genesis 18 comes into
[42:28] view amen are we expecting a body change
[42:32] Genesis 18 what happens
[42:35] three men come from heaven
[42:39] three men come from heaven
[42:42] amen walking through
[42:46] and you know important that is
[42:49] because that's time with body change
[42:52] son of man being revealed is tied to a
[42:55] body change
[42:56] amen praise the Lord praise the Lord
[42:59] amen but
[43:00] I just want to be mindful of what I'm
[43:04] doing here this morning and don't forget

[43:16] everybody you don't want to do
[43:20] I believe
[43:22] therefore all things are possible that's
[43:25] Mark 9 23 right I believe therefore all
[43:29] things are possible and I am Unstoppable

[43:44] a faithful Abraham all the blessings of
[43:46] Abraham are mine yes but we we don't put
[43:49] our hand to work

[43:53] them yeah all of you are blessed yes
[43:57] but maybe you're satisfied with working
[43:59] for a boss

[45:30] what is his energy force yes
[45:33] that's around there

[45:40] believe that ishmael's Nation right
[45:43] they go and open business forever yeah
[45:45] and they are prospering
[45:47] they are working according to their
[45:49] promise whether they know it or not
[45:51] and they are being blessed yeah
[45:54] the same with the Jew
[45:55] the Judas opens business is blessed

[46:21] voice or empty
[46:23] what's right or parent
[46:25] absolutely but it's a lifestyle as well
[46:28] let me tell you Abraham was a man of
[46:30] praise
[46:31] Abraham is a man of worship
[46:33] Abraham was a man of obedience Abraham
[46:36] was a man of submission then you are to
[46:38] submit to God you knew his heart was
[46:40] right amen hallelujah go and go and read
[46:44] there those chapters and see anytime God
[46:45] asks Abraham asks God to bless him
[46:49] he just walked before the Lord and and
[46:51] this man pleased the Lord so much God
[46:52] just started to pour His blessing upon
[46:54] him
[46:55] amen that's how we want to be right amen
[46:58] so
[47:00] I believe therefore all things are
[47:02] possible and I'm unstoppable
[47:04] I'm a force to be reckoned with
[47:07] amen I'm in a resistible force
[47:13] amen
[47:14] so
[47:15] nothing can stop God's plan for your
[47:17] life
[47:18] the truth is that the father is a plan
[47:20] for your life
[47:22] and God is bringing you to pass by
[47:24] moving the clock
[47:26] and bringing you into his picture that
[47:27] he has of us right and nothing can stop
[47:29] God's plan for your life not you not
[47:32] your neighbor no enemy can stop God's
[47:34] plan you'll find in Jeremiah 29 11 it
[47:37] says for I know the plans I have for you
[47:40] say the Lord plans to prosper you and
[47:42] not to harm you his plans is to give you
[47:45] a hope and a future
[47:47] amen is planned the design that is for a
[47:49] specific time and season and God's plans
[47:52] are bigger and better than my plans
[47:58] I don't know if you know the Bible says
[48:00] that God's ways are higher than our ways
[48:01] God's thoughts are higher than our
[48:03] thoughts
[48:04] God wants to give you more than you will
[48:07] be imagine
[48:08] he says exceeding great reward Abraham
[48:10] exceeding Grace he's able to do
[48:12] exceeding abundantly above all
[48:15] that we can ask a thing he is requiring
[48:17] you to believe him he's requiring you to
[48:19] have faith in him he's requiring your
[48:21] future surrender to him
[48:25] amen but in the human nature sometimes
[48:29] we would just want to make plans on our
[48:30] own amen amen we try and rush things
[48:33] ahead of God's Time ahead of God's
[48:35] season and then we get disappointed when
[48:37] our plans don't succeed we wonder why
[48:40] things don't work out for us as planned
[48:42] amen but I want you to know this morning
[48:44] God's timing is perfect
[48:47] he is never too early neither is he too
[48:49] late
[48:50] and God's plan will always come to pass
[48:54] amen amen
[48:57] and for you
[48:58] I want you to know and I really mean
[49:01] this now I'm speaking to you
[49:02] God is not forgotten about you yes
[49:06] thank you God has not forgotten about
[49:08] you young men young women
[49:10] even sisters all sisters young sisters
[49:13] all men young men all of us God has not
[49:17] forgotten about us
[49:20] you are not just here a number
[49:22] filling space
[49:24] [Music]
[49:25] -time
[49:27] amen
[49:28] when we are connected Romans 8 28 you'll
[49:32] find here when we become connected to
[49:34] God's plan God will walk out all things
[49:36] together for our good
[49:39] but we need to be connected to the
[49:40] source
[49:42] we need to be connected to him amen
[49:45] God's plan like we said is designed for
[49:47] a specific time and season and nothing
[49:49] can derail him nothing can make it
[49:51] happen before time amen God promised us
[49:54] that our God never promised us here that
[49:57] our life or not will be easy
[49:59] amen but he did say that there is a time
[50:02] and season for everything like we read
[50:03] in Ecclesiastes right and when it's your
[50:05] turn
[50:07] when it's your turn
[50:09] when it's your time
[50:11] when is your season amen nothing can
[50:13] stop it yes yes people may try and stop
[50:16] it people may try and discourage you but
[50:19] nothing can stop it
[50:22] amen hallelujah
[50:26] so
[50:28] God knows when we're ready
[50:29] God knew when Abraham was ready
[50:32] God in his mind and his cloth he knew 25
[50:34] years had to pass
[50:37] I want everything even Abraham if he
[50:41] slept with 100 women he wouldn't have
[50:42] been able to have children
[50:45] his body was completely past the age to
[50:48] reproduce
[50:49] so God was making sure
[50:52] that it's no human ability here
[50:54] I will show my glory and I will share my
[50:57] glory on nobody that's why Abraham says
[51:00] Lord take your smell like I don't even
[51:01] have seed anymore
[51:07] now the Bible says the thing that which
[51:12] upon the Lord amen
[51:14] shall renew their strength amen
[51:18] they shall Mount up with wings
[51:21] like him
[51:23] amen
[51:24] they that wait upon the Lord if you go
[51:27] to Proverbs 16 and 9. maybe you know we
[51:29] got our own plan sometimes in life but
[51:31] yeah we're Proverbs 16 and 9 says amen
[51:34] Hallelujah a man's heart divides his way
[51:38] but the Lord directed his steps
[51:43] maybe in the night you're planning your
[51:44] plotting what you're going to do but God
[51:46] is ordained your steps amen Proverbs 3
[51:50] and verse 5 and 6 says trust in the Lord
[51:52] with all that heart
[51:54] lean not to thine own understanding
[51:57] in all that ways acknowledge Him and He
[52:00] Shall direct your path
[52:02] amen
[52:04] so we see amen that God has this great
[52:06] clock and this great picture and he has
[52:09] you in his mind
[52:10] and you are forced to be reckoned with
[52:12] but God is working now to bring you into
[52:14] that image ask yourself am I cooperating
[52:17] with God
[52:19] am I submitting to God Amen amen am I
[52:22] surrendering to him do I have the Holy
[52:24] Spirit
[52:25] am I feeling on the word
[52:28] amen
[52:35] praise the Lord
[52:39] so yeah it's slide seven he says the
[52:41] property saying you now
[52:43] you can never go forward until you are
[52:46] perfectly satisfied and know without a
[52:49] shadow of doubt you're walking in God's
[52:51] will
[52:52] so we want to go forward right we want
[52:54] to move ahead in the things of God but
[52:56] we must know that we are walking in his
[52:58] will then when you know you ain't God's
[53:00] Will and walking in his way so there's a
[53:02] will and there's a way nothing can stop
[53:04] you because you know where you're
[53:06] standing you know the way you're going
[53:08] you know what you got in your mind and
[53:10] you know what the will of God is then
[53:12] you can do it
[53:16] amen praise the Lord
[53:18] praise the Lord amen
[53:20] if God would reveal to that little girl
[53:22] now this can be applied to anything in
[53:24] life I'm saying anything take the limit
[53:27] of just healing now here if God would
[53:29] reveal to that little girl sitting there
[53:31] she was going to walk I bet the devil
[53:33] could tell every demon he's got in out
[53:35] of hell that wouldn't stop it
[53:39] that man sitting there in a wheelchair
[53:41] whoever you are it wouldn't stop him no
[53:43] there ain't nothing going to stop him
[53:45] God said so that settled it
[53:50] believe
[53:54] believe I believe therefore
[53:58] all things are possible therefore I'm
[54:01] unstoppable
[54:03] I believe therefore if I lay hands upon
[54:06] the sick they must recover amen
[54:09] I believe
[54:12] they shall lay hands upon the sick they
[54:15] shall recover
[54:17] they shall cast out devils
[54:19] in my name
[54:21] because they believe
[54:24] now
[54:26] let me explain this to you some of you
[54:28] have never seen that scripture come to
[54:31] pass because you are not a disciple of
[54:33] the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:37] you don't believe that that scripture
[54:39] applies to you
[54:40] you believe that that scripture applies
[54:43] in the in the church
[54:45] yet the puppet for the pastor
[54:48] so when somebody is sick you don't see
[54:50] yourself as the disciple of the Lord
[54:52] Jesus Christ
[54:55] to bring that promise to pass
[54:58] so our you see that the true teaching of
[55:01] the word and the true building up of the
[55:04] church is to put the word back into the
[55:06] people and the people operate with the
[55:09] word
[55:10] then you won't find okay you know what
[55:12] I'm gonna tell my pastor about you and
[55:14] we're gonna pray
[55:16] when the need arises you say Lord your
[55:19] word declares here in Mark 16 that these
[55:22] signs you're putting it up for them who
[55:23] don't know it that these signs shall
[55:25] follow them that believe
[55:26] if they lay hands upon the sick they
[55:28] shall recover
[55:29] in my name they shall cast out devils
[55:33] they shall drink deadly things you shall
[55:34] not harm them
[55:36] Mark 16 16 it's gone to maybe 15 16
[55:39] around there
[55:43] amen let's all read it together and
[55:46] these signs shall follow them without
[55:48] believe
[55:49] in my name shall they cast out Devils
[55:52] they shall speak with new tongues
[55:58] they shall take up serpents and if they
[56:00] treat any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[56:03] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[56:05] and they shall recover whose is they
[56:08] go back then
[56:10] one
[56:12] shall follow them that believe
[56:14] now you all raise your hand just now
[56:15] when you told me you believe yes now you
[56:18] all can operate that scripture amen
[56:22] thank you
[56:23] you believe the Lord will back your word
[56:25] up but they met his word up but you have
[56:28] got to perform it
[56:31] any promise of God
[56:33] any promise of God if you believe it
[56:36] God is obligated to his word
[56:39] now we've not seen it maybe I have not
[56:41] seen it in your life because you've
[56:43] never taken the opportunity maybe you
[56:45] were never presented with the
[56:46] opportunity to say Lord I'm taking you
[56:48] at your word even now
[56:55] you have a late answer on the sick
[56:58] you have a laid hands on the sick
[57:02] amen you know what I mean
[57:05] because some of you don't know what I'm
[57:06] saying so I'm going to pray to you
[57:07] personally then you can say no no no no
[57:11] all right
[57:14] we've got to take God's word and see
[57:17] ourselves as Disciples of the Lord Jesus
[57:22] now
[57:23] you've got to find the first opportunity
[57:25] presented to you and God will present
[57:28] opportunities to you day in your life
[57:30] you present opportunities to you but
[57:33] what are we doing with it
[57:37] you see fear said sin sometimes
[57:40] you at work or you wherever you are and
[57:42] somebody tells you oh I'm feeling so
[57:44] sick and I'm feeling so down and yes
[57:46] they are the witnessing opportunity and
[57:47] you tell them assistant brother the word
[57:50] of God declares that if I land upon the
[57:52] sick they shall recover can I pray for
[57:54] you
[57:55] but now
[57:58] we can't do that
[58:02] because
[58:03] we're electricity that work
[58:08] we haven't gone there Superman we've
[58:11] gone this Clark Kent
[58:16] do you understand what I'm saying
[58:18] we've got to work as Clark Kent
[58:22] hiding our identity yeah
[58:25] so now you think you need to go find a
[58:27] full moon
[58:32] do you know what I mean but if we arrive
[58:34] to work as Superman
[58:39] then you don't need to change your
[58:41] behavior change your circumstance
[58:42] because let me tell you what a few
[58:45] moments ago you were laughing at the
[58:46] dirty jokes
[58:50] you were talking nonsense with them I'm
[58:53] feeling sick now suddenly you think I'm
[58:54] like situential around this person
[58:56] right yes okay
[59:01] that's why I say you went there as Clark
[59:02] Kent
[59:03] but they need Superman now
[59:08] amen
[59:11] so yeah yes wait let's let's get this
[59:13] basis now I've been speaking on this for
[59:15] a while but I just love the way the
[59:16] prophet explains it and then we'll close
[59:18] here right he says you say I've got
[59:21] faith the first thing you have to have
[59:22] basis for Faith now that's the word of
[59:24] God
[59:25] so we can read the word of God God says
[59:27] it yes I believe it he believes it here
[59:29] in his mind so all of us can say yes I'm
[59:31] reading the word I believe it it's in
[59:34] your mind you're saying yes I believe
[59:35] learn this concept now it's very
[59:37] important because sometimes this is why
[59:39] our prayers don't get answered but
[59:41] we've got a subconscious also and in
[59:44] that subconscious we disagree like here
[59:47] we are saying I believe I believe but
[59:48] here you're like yeah
[59:53] subconscious disagrees with it because
[59:55] when he starts to do it he's
[59:57] scared it won't happen and it won't
[1:00:01] that's right the prophet says when
[1:00:03] you're scared it won't that's right
[1:00:05] right
[1:00:06] he says like a man crossing the sea the
[1:00:09] man goes across the sea the real man
[1:00:11] that drives the ship he never sees where
[1:00:13] he's going he's down in the bowels of
[1:00:15] the ship the man in the angel room he's
[1:00:18] the engineer the man sitting here on the
[1:00:20] deck he takes he gives the orders from
[1:00:23] the man up in the Crow's Nest he says he
[1:00:25] will send down the word two knots to the
[1:00:27] left
[1:00:28] now the man down there he don't see
[1:00:31] what's going on on top
[1:00:32] right
[1:00:34] it's just the engine well if you would
[1:00:37] give it two knots to the right or what
[1:00:39] if he would just wouldn't give it at all
[1:00:41] then the man up here says go forward and
[1:00:43] he puts it in reverse
[1:00:45] you see what happens when there's a
[1:00:47] struggle between our mind and
[1:00:49] the subconscious and the Heart three
[1:00:52] people now he's talking about one upon
[1:00:54] the Crow's Nest right right on top we
[1:00:56] can see how far
[1:00:57] one was the commanding officer and one
[1:01:00] in the engine room
[1:01:02] but Jesus said who must believe the one
[1:01:04] in the
[1:01:05] engine room
[1:01:07] the one in if you believe in your
[1:01:09] heart the one in the engine room if you
[1:01:12] can get these three aligned the mind the
[1:01:14] subconscious the heart that's where he's
[1:01:17] going with this yeah right he says
[1:01:19] otherwise if there's confused signals
[1:01:22] going on like here what he's talking
[1:01:23] about they'll never get out the harbor
[1:01:26] that's the way the church is you're
[1:01:28] going this way and that way and this way
[1:01:30] and that way yet now when the man up in
[1:01:32] the closeness says Straight Ahead the
[1:01:34] man on the deck says straight ahead and
[1:01:36] the man down in the bottom says straight
[1:01:38] to the Head she's going to move amen
[1:01:46] I am not satisfied when I pray I pray
[1:01:48] and it's not answered
[1:01:50] then I do quick evaluation is my mind
[1:01:54] just believing is my heart believing is
[1:01:56] my subconscious believing here's the
[1:01:58] keys here's the tools
[1:02:00] to walk in perfect faith
[1:02:02] something is out of alignment
[1:02:04] and you need to bring it in alignment
[1:02:06] I'm saying don't be satisfied if your
[1:02:09] word is returning void to you
[1:02:10] that's not the image of the Son of God
[1:02:12] Amen
[1:02:16] you must be the one they come to running
[1:02:18] if they can't do it yeah
[1:02:21] if they can't Castle the demon you must
[1:02:22] be the one they come running to
[1:02:27] so three things must be in line
[1:02:30] Straight Ahead Straight Ahead Straight
[1:02:32] Ahead then she's going to move
[1:02:35] amen yeah he says When God Says buy his
[1:02:38] stripes you are healed the man receives
[1:02:40] it in his heart by his stripes we are
[1:02:42] healed the subconscience hacks back
[1:02:46] by his rights we are healed look out
[1:02:48] something is going to take place yes
[1:02:52] yes you're going forward nothing will
[1:02:54] stop it then you're in full Harmony and
[1:02:56] not away but okay what kind of waves
[1:02:58] come he'll never be contrary to your
[1:03:01] faith
[1:03:02] now some of us have been proclaiming
[1:03:04] that scripture but I Stripes I'm Healed
[1:03:06] by Stripes I'm Healed but what are we in
[1:03:08] full alignment
[1:03:11] he that confessed with his mouth how is
[1:03:14] the word spoken why he thought
[1:03:16] what is a thought expressed so the
[1:03:18] thought is where is it in your
[1:03:21] so you have the thought in your mind
[1:03:22] you're expressing it with your mouth and
[1:03:25] you're believing in your heart
[1:03:27] three things are aligned
[1:03:29] but he's saying if you are saying bye
[1:03:31] you Stripes I'm Healed but then your
[1:03:33] subconscious is not believing it
[1:03:38] he's saying if you can only get the two
[1:03:39] aligned together nothing can stop it
[1:03:42] them you're in full Harmony
[1:03:44] not a wave I don't care what kind of
[1:03:46] wave would come it will never be
[1:03:47] contrary to your faith you you watch
[1:03:50] yourself and see yourself like this you
[1:03:52] know when you believe the word of God so
[1:03:53] much sometimes you know in your heart
[1:03:55] you believe it but watch the battle
[1:03:57] raging in your head
[1:03:59] then the thing to do is quieten down
[1:04:02] and say Lord
[1:04:04] I'm a perfect peace in my heart right
[1:04:06] now
[1:04:07] I believe your word but yes Satan's
[1:04:10] trying to sow thoughts yeah
[1:04:12] but you said if I Believe In My Heart
[1:04:14] you shall have what you say
[1:04:17] right because remember the battle is
[1:04:19] going to be in the mind
[1:04:20] the prophet says you can't stop thoughts
[1:04:22] from coming through this mind but you
[1:04:24] can stop it from settling yes it's not
[1:04:27] so you speak to your body and you say
[1:04:29] Body Mind
[1:04:30] this thing is settled in mouth already
[1:04:33] so you can race and try and cause fear
[1:04:35] and anxiety and rage and worry and all
[1:04:37] of these things it's settled in my heart
[1:04:39] already I have already received it I'm
[1:04:42] waiting for my body to catch up to My
[1:04:44] Confession
[1:04:49] and if you really want to make the devil
[1:04:51] man go and tell everyone you are you
[1:04:55] so nothing tell them
[1:04:57] the guy who you went down and you take
[1:04:59] his uh pamphlet there he was telling me

[1:05:14] through in the McDonald's
[1:05:17] you're telling them Big Mac praise God
[1:05:19] I'm Healed
[1:05:25] come on now yes
[1:05:27] you see
[1:05:29] Faith requires a certain type of
[1:05:32] behavior and that behavior looks mad
[1:05:36] that behavior looks radical
[1:05:39] that behavior looks to be causing a stir
[1:05:42] and a problem
[1:05:44] the behavior will also make you maybe
[1:05:45] look made from the outside make you look
[1:05:47] like you're lying
[1:05:51] come on now
[1:05:52] come on church if you really want to see
[1:05:54] a move of God you need to change your
[1:05:55] behavior you need to even change your
[1:05:57] action and your worship
[1:06:00] you need to change everything about you
[1:06:02] praise is the key praise is the key to
[1:06:05] your Victory amen hallelujah so nothing
[1:06:08] can stop it I hope you're learning from
[1:06:09] these principles you just move right
[1:06:11] through on and on see but you've got to
[1:06:13] make everything in agreement with God's
[1:06:15] word then we move on when we got it all
[1:06:18] lined up and in agreement well that case
[1:06:20] if we say that case is too hard or that

[1:06:27] you're a little scared about it he says
[1:06:29] so yeah he says you mustn't be scared
[1:06:32] right and he says he's taking the type
[1:06:33] of Tyson here what will a young man do

[1:07:32] faithful
[1:07:35] and believe God's word
[1:07:36] that's the way God did when he seen the
[1:07:38] church he loved it nothing was going to
[1:07:40] stop he was ready to give his life God
[1:07:42] moved down in a body of Flesh worthy the
[1:07:44] king of Heaven amen

[1:08:01] title we're not really focusing on his
[1:08:03] life we are trying to see our life in
[1:08:05] there and seeing how shortcomings in
[1:08:07] there and seeing how reasoning can come
[1:08:09] in through Sarah and all of his
[1:08:11] unbeliefs and things but God is giving
[1:08:13] us a new name
[1:08:15] new name means a new nature
