your first breath say thank you Jesus thank you for the breath of life amen hallelujah amen so I'll greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ touch your neighbor greet somebody amen he may be relaxed in the house of the Lord say God bless you amen in our father's house there is Liberty there is freedom Freedom Festival they had worked no doubt maybe you had a hard trying day trolls of life and circumstances but in his presence there is fullness of joy amen so we can just release that into his presence amen hallelujah amen so brother Jeff was not here this evening he's going to king or somewhere even on a work trip pray that the Lord be with him and bless him amen hallelujah we're going to speak tonight and we're going to learn a few lessons we may start a series and I think it's vitally important to speak on Jesus prayer life amen Jesus prayer life Hallelujah and this has to do with the topic of spiritual discipline amen we see that we are heading into a season into a time where we want to encounter the supernatural and see the moving of the Holy Spirit but their secrets to these things amen and we're going to learn from the word of God we'll touch on a few things this evening we may keep the sermon short because we want to get into a time of prayer amen but we will hit the highlights amen so that we get the main points and we look as we look at the prayer life of Jesus Amen everybody feeling good amen hallelujah amen maybe for scripture we can uh let's go to the Book of Mark [Music] Hallelujah this would be the names of the Lord you know I'm just trying to find a place here amen so in The Book of Mark if you can read amen let's just read the first scripture and then we'll get seated amen let's read Mark chapter 1 and verse 35. says and in the morning rising up great while before the day he went out and departed into a solitary place and they prayed amen may be seated [Music] amen so even as we approach this topic I want you to make notes and I want you to start to apply these things to our life amen because there is a world that exists that's unseen to the human eye and science is probing and searching for extra terrestrial life but even if we convince them that this world exists they do not have means to communicate with this world with all these scientific gadgets and the advancements in science they do not have the technology to communicate with this world amen but as a Believer we have the communication Channel we have the communication mechanism that we can use to communicate with the Unseen World amen and that is called prayer amen amen amen our bodies we live in a flesh body governed by our five senses but our body is trapped in a three-dimensional world of time space and matter amen but our prayer can pass through Dimensions amen our body can't leave this Dimension lest we die but we have an effective tool so powerful that he can pass through dimensions and go right into the seventh dimension amen where God himself is sitting hallelujah amen right before the throne room of almighty God our praise gonna sin and touch the heart of God amen amen yes and we can get the attention of God through our prayer amen tonight you'll hear things that maybe we haven't had a long time maybe we'll speak in a way that we haven't not spoken before amen but we want to learn from our Lord Jesus Christ amen so if you are a son and daughter of God I want you to know because sometimes we think God does not hear our prayer if you are a son and daughter of God I want you to know that God hears our prayer amen amen he loves it when you pray and by faith believe and by your faith you believe that he will answer you amen so if I had to ask you a question before we get started where does prayer rank in your priorities in life is it first place second place third place or right now is there no place at all in your life for prayer amen that you can answer for yourself amen isn't it sure to pray is it difficult to pray do we become lazy to pray or is prayer our number one priority now this is the spiritual discipline that we need to instill in our lives amen amen now we can model ourselves after many people many spiritual men in fact we can model ourselves after all the apostles we can even try to model ourselves after the prophet but there is no one greater than the Lord Jesus Christ amen so if we are going to model ourselves with somebody let us rather choose to model ourselves after the Lord Jesus Christ because he is the original image of the perfect man and we must strive to be like him do you know what happens if you try to copy something from a copy everybody wants to be a copy of the original if you got a painting that if you can't have the original painting they want a copy of the original but as you start to make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy the picture starts to lose it value the picture starts to lose its quality so we don't want to be copies of somebody else's Ministry we want to be like a copy of the original our Lord Jesus Christ that's my point in driving that right so he was the ultimate example set for us he operated in an anointing and an atmosphere and lived in a world of perfect faith that we know nothing about we may have experienced glimpses of this world but to truly live in that world of perfect faith Jesus had spiritual discipline even though he was the son of God amen and the spirit of God descended on him at the Jordan River our lord Jesus taught us to be obedient to the will of the father and he prayed to the father you see if we if we move past these things and we don't notice Jesus life and Ministry we are going to miss key elements in how we operate if we think Jesus was the god man he was deity and he just did and spoke things but if you follow carefully we'll see his life amen praise strengthens why why am I emphasizing on prayer I'll give you some cheese prayer strengthens the spirit of the spirit man amen today I had a manager come to me in the morning and he tells me hey Pastor why don't you come and meet with us in the boardroom and we'll have some privity and teach us how to do this and that yeah sorry all the conversation started there was a song playing on the you know in the dealership to pay songs and he said hey I love the song You know the song I said no I don't know the song he says hey how you don't know the song such a popular song I said I don't listen to ungodly music he says Ah you can't be so spiritual man then I said no do you only want to satisfy the flesh man I said do you know you have a spirit do you know you possess a soul he said no no I want to sit here now I want you to tell me what you're talking about you see because the denominational world only caters to the flesh they preach to the flesh they say things to satisfy the flesh so he says I want to learn more I spoke to him a bit and then he tells me oh how can I develop this thing because I find myself not doing these things no matter how much we pray for you if I pray for you you cannot get spiritual discipline you are good to do it spiritual I can't lay hands on you and you get spiritual discipline he says oh my pastor sent me a long message another Pastor sends me a short message I need is one and I delete my pastor's wife I said you see you do not want it he's saying how do I make time for God how do I get along with God he's questioning these things I said it starts with you the holy spirit will call you to prayer amen right keep the warning of the spirit and when you feel the call don't go to tick tock don't go to Instagram don't go to Facebook don't go to Whatsapp get on your knees and stop praying amen we need to understand and be sensitive to one another in the family as well and realize our roles and our purposes amen don't always try to look to the Flesh and look to them sometimes the person needs to be in prayer yes amen because there's so much going on and so much of attack on the enemy amen and that's why it takes a good wife he takes a good husband he takes good children to be sensitive to the atmosphere that you know this is not the times of this this is not it's not time for that you know amen so prayer strengthens the spirit man and it kills the flesh man if you want to be spiritually strong we must have spiritual discipline of getting alone with God and pray to him tonight I will speak in a way that might develop a hunger in some of us amen and that's what I'm trying to do as I'm speaking I want to actually stop and just pray because I want to develop such an anger and a passion for God yes amen like when we develop a strong prayer life we start to grow in the spirit Spirit may have start to grow the Holy Spirit can move in us and operate in the authority and power that he did in Jesus and the apostles amen the reason we did not see the power flowing in the authority and the anointing flowing in the power and anointing is because we are not realized we have no consecrated time [Music] so let's get started someone may ask young people may ask how many times a day should I pray how many times should we pray let's get some answers how many times do you think we should pray brother Caleb sorry foreign we can pray whenever you want okay we will follow your prayer life you pray whenever you want so I may never want to pray that's whenever I want right I may want to pray once a week get my point we will leave it to us with a lack of spiritual discipline and we say I'll pray whenever I want then it's putting it out to own a spiritual discipline and we could pray once a week once a month how many times a day do you think we should pray brother Jaden ideally how many times should we pray sorry two times a day amen anybody else want to give me an answer pray without seizing amen but brother I wish you got what you got the phone so answer you got lots of things to do it's not always possible right because we in the flesh body as well we have jobs so let's look to the scripture because I'm not giving him my own opinion my own thoughts we have scriptural chat we go to the scriptures let's go to our first scripture and it's found in Psalm 55 and verse 17. now King David here is talking and here we're going to learn that the Jews why they pray three times a day so King David was a devout Jew and he declared that he prayed three times a day it was now after that it became customary for the Jews to pray three times a day and hear what he says evening and morning and at noon evening morning and noon and I love them because he's writing line with Genesis because the evening and the morning was the first day so he starts his day in the evening everyone's following my phone the Bible says the evening and the morning was the first day so you guys think David saying evening and morning and at noon will I pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice let's move along now you move along and we come now to a time of Daniel Daniel chapter 6 and verse 10 and he says now this is the time when they pass a decree to catch Daniel it says now when Daniel knew the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being opened in his chamber towards the Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a fourth time so he did it before it was his custom to pray three times a day now those of us who are more spiritual and can pray five times a day can pray 10 times a day or pray without teasing you should do that but as a minimum we should pray three times a day now I know a lot of message people right now even if they're listening here oh we don't mean of religious in their message don't try to bring religion at least get religious and pray three times a day you demon amen because it's always the religious people that were come against things of God when you're trying to instill spiritual discipline amen so I asked you young men young women men and brothers sisters I don't want you to raise your hand can we commit to praying three times a day evening morning at noon set a reminder because we've got to train I don't need many amens amen amen I don't want you to get uncomfortable when we talk about prayer if you want to see the power of God flow in your life if you want to see the anointing if you want to see yourself get closer with God this is how you start right amen okay before we get to Jesus I want to get to two scriptures to show you the lifestyle of the disciples in Acts chapter 3 and verse 1 it says Peter and John went up together into the temple Happy Hour of Prayer so there was a call to prayer amen amen being the ninth hour so they were following the evening morning and noon they were going to pray now notice what happens we're not really going to go into it but what happens is they come to the game called Beautiful bring it up they come through the gate called Beautiful they see a man in need yes they're Christians they see a beggar and they want to give him something but they said silver and gold have we met amen amen Peter you got any change on you no I don't have any change Peter you gotta I don't have change oh I really wanted to help you but soon and goal that we none am en but such as we have [Music] the name of Jesus raise up and walk amen amen what does it teach us now even if you don't have money and don't just tell the beggar I don't have tell them Silver and Gold Have I None yes yes how about we model that how many times we just do this we don't even say silver and gold there are none but such as I have even if it's a word impart something to somebody we're going to our second scripture Acts chapter 10 and verse 9 it says on the moral as they went on the journey and Drew Naya to the city Peter went upon that I'll stop to pray about the sixth hour hmm he's making time to pray I'm going to summarize this very quickly because it's a long story Peter has a vision while he's praying and in that vision it leads him to meeting Cornelius and the Holy Spirit falls upon them the Holy Spirit falls upon the Gentiles and it opens up the great mystery to the early church that the gospel was not to the Jews only but it was also for the Gentiles we'll read Acts chapter 10 you'll get the full story so it all started with Peter's spiritual discipline and the desire to pray to God so as this is where we want to start now your prayer life is the foundation of your ministry your praying life is the foundation of your anointing your prayer life amen you can only operate in the spirit well and as good as your prayer life is amen with the level of anointing that you can operate him it depends on your prayer life so when we pray remember this now when we pray we are not forcing God to change his mind we're not asking God to do something outside of his will amen when we pray we are praying to align ourselves with the will of God Amen and when we begin to align ourselves with the will of God Amen we become a channel that God's power can flow through so we said you start by praying three times a day you say how do I pray I've never prayed in my life we're going to show you a sample prayer of how that when they came to Jesus and said Lord teach us how to pray let's start there Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9. amen he says after this manner therefore pray he Our Father so when you're calling him our father you're recognizing yourself as the son as his son and daughter right that's relationship now who shot in heaven Hallowed be thy name holy is your name start by worshiping him don't just bombard heaven with I want I want I want Lord sought sort this out for me no hello would be thy name amen because thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven so he's starting by worshiping him he's standing by inviting the will of God into your life when you're inviting the will of God you are saying change the circumstances around me to align with your will give us this day then he starts would give us this day I'll give you bread and forgive us our death as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen so you start with worship you end worship okay you can go and study that even more now we get to Jesus our lord Jesus and we turn to Matthew chapter 14. we're going to learn here now Jesus just performs A great miracle there's five thousand people five thousand men on a hill beside the woman and the children that follow him to listen to his teaching and after such a great miraculous thing that happened way he takes the fish and the bread the Loaves and he multiplies it and he feeds five thousand men let's see what our lord Jesus Does pay attention now amen and when he sent the multitudes away he went up into the mountain apart to pray spiritual discipline amen he didn't say did you see what I did there guys I fed five thousand men alone the Son of God goes to a mountain apart to truth it was coming they say oh you're a religious man there's Jesus now I'm going to show you three times he prayed evening morning noon time Jesus goes to the mountain apart to pray when the evening was come he was there [Music] alone time with God is very important so think about it now because virtually Jesus every time he does a miracle every time he has a vision Everybody follow yeah when you drive your car for too long what runs out you need to refuel and prayer is the fuel you refuel your spirit man with prayer amen amen so he goes there alone and he comes back fully charged and when you got a full take of you what you're going to do go and read Jesus now looks for his disciples and where are they on the sea and because he's so fully charged of the anointing he walks on the water to get to them charged in the presence of God Amen amen he went from one Miracle to the next amen he was so full of the anointing and power Jesus lived in the world of perfect Faith there he was thinking it's normal for him to walk and walk and the disciples was who's this walking on the water Maybe Matthew chapter 6 and verse 6. now Jesus goes to the mountain apart to pray he goes in the evening and he goes alone let's listen to his instruction to us Matthew chapter 6 and verse 6 but thou when thou praised stop [Music] what did we learn there Jesus is not saying but thou if you pray Jesus is expecting his disciples and people who say yeah his followers to pray he's not saying if you pray the word is when you pray enter into thy closet the ones that are looking for an excuse right now saying I have no closet and when that was shut the door what is that teaching us No Interruption no distraction don't shut the door with your cell phone in there pray to thy father which is in credible and thy father would see it in secret shall reward me openly there's a reward in prayer amen you know how far is so good there's nothing we can do for him that he will not give us more he will not rewarded even in prayer he rewards Us by answering us so what did we learn there When you pray go into a private place private space shut the door pray to your father in secret he will reward you openly now that is confirmation of what Jesus is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and in Matthew verse chapter 6 you can learn this one key When you pray do not use repetition do not use vain repetition what does that word mean in effect your prayer becomes ineffective ineffective repetition so that was Jesus praying in the evening let's go to Mark chapter 1 verse 35 it says and in the morning rising up a great while before the day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there pray if you read the verses before you'll find amen what what's happening there right but he rises early in the morning that's what we wanted so we saw the previous verse he goes in the evening he goes alone amen here he's going in the morning rising up before the day it starts and he goes out into a solitary place and he prays even when Jesus ministry is becoming so popular Jesus goodrew himself from the crowds let's go to Luke 15 and sorry Luke 5 and verse 15. it says and so much more Wednesday Fame abroad of him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed of him of the infirmities but Jesus didn't mingle with him he says he withdrew himself into the Wilderness and prayed amen so don't get excited about crowds don't get excited that so many people are following my Ministry amen people who are anointed know the key to their power prayer amen prayer so we're gonna go to our next point now Jesus spent time in prayer before he made important decisions I hope I'm stripping this down for you to show you that even though he was the Lord God Almighty in flesh he consulted the Lord in prayer he spent time in prayer before making important decisions sometimes we ACT first and then we want to pray when things don't work out or go away then we want to pray we want to make decisions without praying about it Amen in fact some of us believe we are so anointed um [Music] amen some of us believe we are the bride of Christ we are so anointed we can just go forward and do things surely everything I do is right and we don't pray about it but look at the most anointed man the God man amen he prayed before making important decisions we'll go to Lucas for that amen Jesus it says he came to pass in days that he went up into a mountain to pray and continue all night amen in prayer to God Amen amen why would Jesus have an all-night prayer meeting and he just didn't pray throughout the night listen what it says and when it was day he prayed all night going into the day what's he going to do tell me what's this important decision is going to select his 12 disciples so when he's making his most important decision about which 12 he will choose he just doesn't go choose that personally amen when you're choosing for a wife for a husband don't choose a personally amen amen Jesus choosing his disciples he goes all night into the mountain to pray yes for those of you are streaming unfortunately the stream is going to be cut now because of load shedding and the towers cell phone towers are going to go off so we built thee farewell and I encourage you to use this time to pray amen and again
