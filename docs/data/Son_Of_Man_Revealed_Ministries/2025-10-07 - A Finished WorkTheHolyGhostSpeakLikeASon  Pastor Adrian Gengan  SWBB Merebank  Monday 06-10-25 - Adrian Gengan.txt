========================================

Every day, &gt;&gt; every day and everyone, [Music] &gt;&gt; let's do powerful prayer. Our gracious loving heavenly father, what a privilege it is for us to come and be gathered together, Lord, in this evening time. And Lord, even as we've come for the special time, Lord, of consecration, Lord, you see the hearts of your people, oh God, the desperate cry within them, oh God, Lord, for an outpouring of your spirit, Lord Jesus, for the dynamics to fall upon the mechanics, oh God. And Lord, we believe you've positioned us for such a time as this. Oh God, we know you've called us for the season, for this time, for this purpose. Oh God, and even as we see, Lord, world leaders, Lord, politics, religion, everything take their place, we're glad to see your bride take their place, oh God. Lord position ourselves. So we ask Lord that the angel of God be present with us. Great Holy Spirit come amongst us. Oh God we are depending on you. We pray Lord that your word will quicken us Father and raise the faith of your people oh God for them to receive what they desire now. Lord I pray Lord that your spirit will be amongst us now even as we further continue. We ask your blessings in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a big hand of praise. Amen. We greet everyone in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe everyone's under expectation for the Lord to do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know we taught by the prophet, we get what we expect. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I say increase your expectation. Enlarge your borders and enlarge your territories this week. Amen. We're thankful. Amen. For the man of God who has a vision for the church, our pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. And without a vision, the people perish. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we thank the Lord. Amen. That the Lord has put this upon the heart of our pastor Denzel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I pray that even as we go through the word, Amen. things will be quicker to you. That you can have some faith this evening. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you know that not all of you will receive everything in one night. &gt;&gt; But you know that some of you will receive it tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's according to your expectations. So let's turn to Genesis chapter 1. Let's get to the our origins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where we fell from and this is what Jesus Christ has already done for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say it in that way because Christ is not coming to do any new thing. &gt;&gt; He's already done it for us. &gt;&gt; Satan lies to us that there's something that further work to be done, &gt;&gt; but it's a finished work of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 1 chapter 1 verse 26. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, and after our likeness, and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over and all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." &gt;&gt; So God created man in his own image. &gt;&gt; In the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. Now notice there in 26 he says let's make man in our image and likeness. &gt;&gt; But when he creates man there's one part missing. &gt;&gt; If you see there he says God created man in his image. He doesn't speak about the likeness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. And God blessed them and said unto them, "Be fruitful, multiply, replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." So the denominational concept is that man was made to worship. &gt;&gt; God already had worship. &gt;&gt; God had created the angels to worship. &gt;&gt; But here, if you read the Bible, he says, "Let them have dominion." &gt;&gt; Man is supposed to have dominion upon the earth. Amen. This is one more portion of scripture. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10. Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10 says, "For we are his workmanship." &gt;&gt; We just read we were created by him. &gt;&gt; Where is his workmanship? Now God don't create defective workmanship. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's thoughts are excellent. &gt;&gt; So we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So his thoughts of us is excellence. &gt;&gt; He says, "I know the plans I have for you, say the Lord. For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; So you see our identity is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not operating independent from Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when the headstone has come upon the body, we are in Christ seated in heavenly places, present tense. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had made before before day that we should walk in them. The Lord had bless you through the reading of his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we're looking at the scripture now, remember our goal and our purpose is to go back to our original. &gt;&gt; That's what the cross was for. That's why Jesus came and died to take us back to what he created us in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Because of the fall, we lost our consciousness and we had amnesia. We forgotten what God had made us to be. &gt;&gt; But the scriptures are here to remind us what God has created us in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; And we know this great mystery laying here. Amen. That when God had created the spirit man, locked up in the spirit man were Amen. They were male and female. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But then God takes his spirit and he puts him in a body of flesh. &gt;&gt; Now notice we were speaking about being created in his image and likeness. And the Bible doesn't say anything about being in his likeness. He says &gt;&gt; God created him in his image because there was a path for Adam to play and grow up into the mature state of the word. &gt;&gt; Now follow my thought. Mazdc was the mature state of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God had just condescended from spirit to word to flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you didn't know, the spirit that was living within Adam was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the original title deed that we lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister, if you can just back up the original spirit. Amen. Because I sent some unbelief here. People believe that we have the Holy Ghost, but they don't believe that Adam had the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That is the secret. &gt;&gt; Adam lost the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And because of the Holy Ghost, Adam could operate like a God man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam could speak to the wind. He could speak to the waves. He could speak to things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God had pondered. &gt;&gt; God was now dwelling in a man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you find it, sister, you just tell me. I think you'll find two hits there. But if you find the exact search original spirit and we'll just find it where where the property's talking about this. You'll also find it in Christ the mystery of God revealed. Amen. Let's just go to the top of this. Let's take it from the time somebody's born again. When a man confesses his sins, &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; and gets right with God and God drops the sin of his this confession into the blood of his own blood and forgives that sin and replaces in that man the original spirit &gt;&gt; that should have been there. &gt;&gt; So man's original spirit is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Now if if you're wondering now where where are we going with this? Think of it. Jesus died. He rose again. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they come and they they're about to see Jesus ascend to heaven and they're asking him, "When are you going to restore the kingdom?" &gt;&gt; They're expecting Jesus to restore a king like David and a king like Solomon. &gt;&gt; And Jesus tells them, "It's not for you to know the times and the seasons, but you shall receive power." &gt;&gt; They thought Jesus was coming to establish a physical kingdom with a physical king. Amen. But yeah, Jesus was going to bring back man's original spirit and establish you as king and preached on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, what would be the first thing if we if if somebody lost something in the garden of Eden, &gt;&gt; the first thing I must give you back? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you are redeemed, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; is the first thing you lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus tells him, go in the upper room. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wait 10 days there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the first thing that comes back to man is the first thing that they lost. And Amen. Like a mighty rushing wind come to the Holy Ghost better to dwell in the original dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that's where the power comes from. &gt;&gt; Amen. You shall be endured with power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost comes upon you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So the devil wants us to amen to to confuse our thinking and make us think that there's something more to attain like he did with &gt;&gt; Eve. &gt;&gt; They were already in the image of God. &gt;&gt; To be in the image of God, it means to be Amen. to have his character. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. To have God's nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to the word image means to have his character. His nature to function. Amen. To be like God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word likeness means to function like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; To function like God. &gt;&gt; To be in doubt and worry is to malfunction. &gt;&gt; To be an unbelief is to malfunction. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we were created in the image and likeness of God. Now, Adam, if you find there, you'll find this in the in the in the message uh the prophet preaching in the church ages that Adam was a spoken seed word son of God. &gt;&gt; If you type that up, you'll also find it spoken seed word. &gt;&gt; Now, no seed is mature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says Adam was a spoken seed word son of God. &gt;&gt; Which means Adam had to grow up in stature. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's where Eve couldn't wait for Adam to come to the mature state of the word. &gt;&gt; If you're wondering where we're going with this, that's exactly how we are coming. We are growing in his likeness. That's why brother Brandon draws that pyramid and he's got all seven virtues. That's the likeness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Adam was growing from his seed spoken seed of God. He was going to come into a mature state of the word which was to be like Melzdc &gt;&gt; to function like Melzdc &gt;&gt; and Eve could not wait for him to come to the mature state of the word where he could speak to her and say you shall have a son and his name shall be called. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the serpent offered her two ways. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can either wait for Adam to come to maturity or you can reproduce the animal way. Yes. &gt;&gt; And if because she got deceived, the Bible says she was deceived, &gt;&gt; she chose to reproduce the animal way. &gt;&gt; That's how sin and death came into the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So why is the Holy Ghost so important? The Holy Ghost is one of the most hated things on the earth right now. &gt;&gt; People don't like the Holy Ghost. People want healing. People want deliverance. People want all the blessings of God without the one the main central theme which is the Holy Ghost given to the believer. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost empowers us. Amen. The Holy Ghost is deity of God within us. &gt;&gt; But people hate the Holy Ghost. They feel the Holy Ghost is too restrictive. I can't watch my Netflix. I can't watch my shows. I can't drink. I can't smoke. I can't do the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you can't tell me that you can take the Holy Ghost and say now Holy Ghost we're going to watch a series together. &gt;&gt; The Bible says or the prophet says the Holy Ghost takes his &gt;&gt; life. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost feeds on the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we say we are believers of the message. We believe an entire prophet. How many messages have we read? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe this prophet &gt;&gt; but we don't read his books. Amen. &gt;&gt; We so much on Tik Tok, &gt;&gt; on Facebook. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. On Instagram, and all of these things, but we believe a message. &gt;&gt; We must be careful we don't become like Pharisees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have Abraham as our father. &gt;&gt; We have Brandham as our prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know you identifying brother Brandham as a prophet is not good enough? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A lot of people identify William Brandham as a prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. The key is his message. If your heart is not turned back, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The key to William Brand is that your heart must be turned back to the original thing. &gt;&gt; Which means the same signs, the same wonders, the same miracles ought to be present in a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to know that it is a finished work. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Brandon says we don't have time to go into the quotes but if you want to read it amen you can find it and show it to you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says if Jesus was standing here right now &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you came and touched the off his garment nothing will happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you came to Jesus and said, "Son of David, have mercy on me." Nothing would happen &gt;&gt; because he has already paid the price. &gt;&gt; Brother is saying now that Jesus will tell you, "I can't do anything for you. You've got to believe the word that by my stripes you were healed." &gt;&gt; If you put up one Peter chapter 2 verse 24 there, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, Amen. &gt;&gt; Salvation and healing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Two things Christ has already done for the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 2:4. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, this is a very very powerful scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He says, "Who in his own self bear our sins in his own body?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he took if he takes care of the sin question. &gt;&gt; That's right. Lord, &gt;&gt; then you are better condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who in his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we being dead to sins. &gt;&gt; Come on. We got to believe that we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and we are dead to sin. &gt;&gt; Do you know what the problem is? The problem is our tongue. &gt;&gt; We speak like denomination people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We like to say brother, you know, I'm a sinner saved by grace. Are you a sinner? &gt;&gt; You were a sinner. &gt;&gt; So change your confession. Amen. We've got to believe we are the redeemed. We sing songs like, "I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; I've been bought with a price." &gt;&gt; But then we soon call ourselves sinners. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what Christ thinks of us? &gt;&gt; Sinners. &gt;&gt; Spotless &gt;&gt; without wrinkle. &gt;&gt; That's how Christ sees us. &gt;&gt; And that's how we need to see ourselves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What did Jesus proclaim? The brother says Jesus proclaimed I'm the virgin born son of God &gt;&gt; and my blood is fresh on the cross. You remember when he's going to claim back &gt;&gt; the key of hell at the grave. &gt;&gt; You remember how brother Brandon dramatizes it. He identifies who he is and he starts to speak according to the confession of his faith. &gt;&gt; I paid the price. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says I paid the price. And now you've got to let go of this property. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we have got to believe. The Bible says that he's presenting us spotless &gt;&gt; without wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blameless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So don't see yourself the moment we see ourselves as a sinner, as somebody who's still struggling with things. Amen. We are nullifying the cross. &gt;&gt; Let me explain this to you. When how many people believe you're going in the rapture? Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. So you believe that Jesus saw you raptured at one point, &gt;&gt; which means when he died for you, he took care of every sin, past, present, and until the rapture. &gt;&gt; So he already saw you raptured. He already saw all the nonsense you're going to get through. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he already died at the cross for your sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to liberate you this evening to tell you there is nothing you can do that Christ blood hasn't taken pure. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know at the end of our message that Christ has only come back to redeem his gene back to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. The part of the world that was part of him. He has come to pay the price for them to redeem them back to himself. Which means the missing piece that was taken from his side at Calvary. Now in this time of season after the fields are open the river has been put back &gt;&gt; Christ and his bride are not functioning as two individuals. They are functioning as one body one unit right now. That's right. &gt;&gt; So if we can only realize how powerful we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem is with our mouth. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; God has given us dominion over the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God is God in the heavens, &gt;&gt; but here on earth, God won't violate his own law &gt;&gt; because he spoke a word in Genesis and said that you should have dominion on the earth. If God ever wants to do anything on the earth, he always comes and works by a man. &gt;&gt; Prove me wrong. Show me in the Bible where God came on the earth and did something without first getting a man to cooperate with his plan. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When Adam fell, he couldn't get anyone. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The first man he got was Enoch. But Amen. And he got Enoch to build a pyramid which was the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But then he finally found a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the name of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A man who would believe God's word. &gt;&gt; A man who would leave his religion, &gt;&gt; would leave his gods. &gt;&gt; Amen. And follow up to this one true God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says the Holy Ghost is a gentleman. &gt;&gt; He doesn't force his way on anyone. &gt;&gt; But do you know who makes the Holy Ghost powerless? &gt;&gt; The prophet of God is saying this that the Holy Ghost needs a body to walk through. &gt;&gt; You know, the Holy Ghost is not meant to float around like a ghost in the air. &gt;&gt; He's meant to tabernacle people. &gt;&gt; He's meant to live in people. and we make it powerless. Brother Brandham says denominational rivers having bound &gt;&gt; for 2,000 years. But he says the evening message loose the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I say if this is the evening message, the Holy Ghost is loose amongst us and we are the most powerful people on the earth right now. &gt;&gt; There there's there's something going on that message people think that Israel is more blessed than you. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Israel turned their back against Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when people talk about Israel, they like hold them in such high regard. Do you know the God don't work with the Jew and the Gentile at the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's got his queen on the earth now. &gt;&gt; You are God's chosen people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are God's chosen people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God won't honor the Jews prayer over yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are the queen of heaven. &gt;&gt; Now, if you go to Psalm 115 there. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read from verse 16. Just want to nail this point down to show you that God needs you in this time and season. &gt;&gt; You know, God didn't choose any other people on the earth to be in the end time. He didn't choose Paul to be at the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't choose any Peter, the one who had the keys to the kingdom. He didn't choose them to be in the end time right now. &gt;&gt; But he chose you. &gt;&gt; Because you have a quality of his gen within you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A particular quality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And your gene can withstand deception. &gt;&gt; Your gen can't be deceived. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that he says you will not be deceived like he fell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here it says the heavens even the heavens are whose &gt;&gt; but the earth yet given to who? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, anything that happens on the earth, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; you are the master of creation. &gt;&gt; Anything that's to happen on the earth must come via you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If sickness wants to enter your body, &gt;&gt; you have the power &gt;&gt; because of the finished work on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. because of the finished work on Calvary, you have the power to tell it what to do and where to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we go back there now, so did we establish that the heavens are the Lord but the earth is &gt;&gt; this is scripture now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. For those of you are quiet and you want to find your scripture, you maybe your scripture is the next one. You know, I don't know if you got I don't know all of you here, but maybe you got some quiet people in the church. Amen. And and you know people like to identify themselves in scripture. &gt;&gt; And if you put the next verse, some people will say that's my verse because it says the dead praise not the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can see who don't praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what we are looking at if we go back to 1 Peter 2:24, we didn't finish reading that. Amen. that in his in his own body he bore our sins. So he took care of the sin question. And when sin and unbelief is taken care of, we are going back to our original condition. You should live unto righteousness. &gt;&gt; Now let me see by your hands how many of you are holy. &gt;&gt; We all of you are righteous. You see, it's going to come. &gt;&gt; How many of you are perfect? &gt;&gt; Okay. But you see, half the congregation don't have their hands up &gt;&gt; because we haven't realized that Christ has done it all. [Music] &gt;&gt; If we don't see ourselves as perfect, &gt;&gt; as righteous, &gt;&gt; as holy, then we are not yet in Christ. The headstone is not descended on us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see up there, you'll see a suspended headstone. &gt;&gt; That was John in the days of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Right now, Christ is in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are here to welcome that Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you miss them, if you miss the shout, you miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't be waiting for to meet the Lord in the air if you miss the shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The shout is heavenly places. &gt;&gt; He says we are now seated together in heavenly places &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; So it says here we should live unto righteousness. &gt;&gt; So we should come Hebrews tells us we should come boldly into his throne of grace. &gt;&gt; Come boldly. &gt;&gt; We should never come before God with a servant mentality. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we should never come before God and say, "Lord, heal me. Lord, heal me. Lord, deliver me." &gt;&gt; You are nullifying the cross. &gt;&gt; You ought to already thank him that he has already healed you 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; Think of John Ryan. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; John Ryan had to keep confessing. &gt;&gt; Praise God, I'm healed. &gt;&gt; He was blind as a death, but praise God, I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God, I'm healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; It took him about 6 months to hold on to his confession &gt;&gt; and to keep confessing. Wherever he went, he was confessing. Praise God, I'm healed. &gt;&gt; And our Lord Jesus is the high priest of our confession. &gt;&gt; So one day, Amen. the Lord is now standing there as the high priest. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he asked the angels. I my mind comes across John Ryan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I have his praise here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and I see his confession. He keeps saying, "Praise God, I'm healed." &gt;&gt; What's the current status of John Ryan? &gt;&gt; And the angel says, "Lord, he's still he's blind." &gt;&gt; But the high priest says, "Today is his day." &gt;&gt; We are going to change John Brian's reality to match his confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here on the earth now, John Brian is going to have a haircut &gt;&gt; and he's sitting there in the barber's chair. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And now they want to poke some fun at him and he said, "Hey John, we have you can see." &gt;&gt; Now what if that day John had enough of the mocking &gt;&gt; and enough of the laughing &gt;&gt; and he said, "You know what? I'm tired of all of this. &gt;&gt; For 6 months, I've held on to this testimony. &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep my mouth quiet. &gt;&gt; And I want him to cut my head." &gt;&gt; He was one confession away from receiving what he had desired. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So one more time, praise God, I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what are we saying? Hold on to your confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now some of you may be renting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I was telling the church yesterday that it is illegal to be poor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is illegal to be poor. &gt;&gt; It is illegal to be sick. &gt;&gt; It is illegal to be unemployed. &gt;&gt; You say, "How come you say it's illegal?" According to the word, all of those things are illegal. &gt;&gt; It's illegal for you to be sick &gt;&gt; because by you already healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, we got to come with bold, run faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you go and find in the book of Genesis, after Abraham sacrifices, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; After Abraham sacrifices, you'll find it there. I think it's in forget the chapter now, &gt;&gt; but you'll find that the Lord tells him, "In blessing, I will bless thee." &gt;&gt; In multiplying, I will multiply thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know that scripture? In blessing, I will bless thee. Let's find it here in the in the word and you can read it for yourself and apply the word. Amen. How if you like to apply the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, whatever God is going to do for us, it's already done is what I'm trying to say. Genesis 22:16, sister. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Genesis 22 and:e 16. I said, "Sorry, pastor. I don't know if the needs are only healing, but I'm preaching like a general thing on faith &gt;&gt; because it applies in all areas." &gt;&gt; The point is it's already done. &gt;&gt; You just need to awaken to the reality of it. &gt;&gt; So here he says, "And said, by myself have I sworn." &gt;&gt; God himself is swearing. Amen. &gt;&gt; By myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord, for because thou has done this thing and has not put out thy son, thine only son, &gt;&gt; that in blessing I will bless thee. &gt;&gt; And in multiplying, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies. &gt;&gt; And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou has obeyed my voice. Believe me, there's a there's a blessing attached because you left denomination, you left your Hindu religion, you left your religion, you left the people of this world and you obey the voice of God. &gt;&gt; There's a blessing attached to them. &gt;&gt; Now you say, what has got to do with me? You see, most of you now are thinking, I'm not saying all of you, most of you are thinking now on the Jewish people &gt;&gt; being the seed. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Galatians 3 and verse 29 and see who the seed is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Galatians 3:29. If you be where? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Galatians 3 29. And if you be Christ, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; Didn't we just read in Ephesians 2:10? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we were his workmanship created in Christ. &gt;&gt; If we be in Christ, &gt;&gt; then you are Abraham's seed. Yes. &gt;&gt; And according to the promise &gt;&gt; that's why I say it is illegal to be poor because of this word. &gt;&gt; Which means we are not operating under by myself have I sworn &gt;&gt; in blessing our blessing. &gt;&gt; So what do we need to do? Change our confession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We live as high as our confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the situations, the current places we find ourselves in is because of our lack of vision. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a lack of vision. &gt;&gt; If if you're desiring a certain thing, God has placed a desire in. &gt;&gt; I say if you're born again and you're a faithful son of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't put it to sleep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be a man of vision. &gt;&gt; Indoors. Indoors. I think it's paragraph 84. Brother Brandon says, "I like a man of vision." &gt;&gt; Not somebody just laying around saying, "Oh, whatever will be will be." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Go do something about it." &gt;&gt; God placed you on the earth. &gt;&gt; I said it's illegal to be unemployed because God created man and he said, "Amen. Go work in the garden." He created a garden and he put man to work in the garden. Amen. &gt;&gt; So my plan is to show you if you're unemployed, you need to go to God as a son of God and say it is illegal for me to be unemployed. &gt;&gt; I come here as a son of God. &gt;&gt; I come here not with servant mentality, but I come here knowing my position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I thank you for employment. &gt;&gt; Cuz some of you maybe you know sometimes you can get a job but as life situation changes that finance is not good enough for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you have your first child and then change things change. You have your second child, things change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're trusting the Lord. If you go to Psalm 75:6, there you're trusting the Lord for something. I want you to know it is not with you pleading to your boss. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to go to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Joseph was the least qualified to run Egypt. &gt;&gt; This boy was a spoiled boy. &gt;&gt; He never took care of sheep. &gt;&gt; His brothers were taking care of sheep. &gt;&gt; His father gave him a seven talented robe. &gt;&gt; And he was pampered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was not qu He was the least qualified to run part of his house, &gt;&gt; to be the head of the prison, &gt;&gt; let alone leave Egypt. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But God don't look the way we look. &gt;&gt; Just like how David was not qualified to be a king. &gt;&gt; But when God qualifies a man, he equips a man. &gt;&gt; God has qualified you as the bride of Jesus Christ, as the wife of Jesus Christ, as sons and daughters of God. God has put his stamp of approval on you. And don't let the devil lie to you that you are not good enough. You are good enough. God says you are good enough. The Bible says that promotion cometh neither from the east, neither from the west nor from the south. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sister. But God is the judge. He put down one and he will sit one up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You read 1 Chronicles chapter 4, be a man of vision like Jabz. &gt;&gt; You know, do you know Jab has such vision? &gt;&gt; Yes. Because if you if you read the story about how they were demarcated land, &gt;&gt; the prophet says, Amen. that according to how their mothers called their name in child birth, Joshua placed them in the land and marked out their portion of their inheritance. &gt;&gt; But this man &gt;&gt; had a vision that was greater than what was marked up for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles 4, I think it's verse 9, you'll see that &gt;&gt; Jabz worked every if he was into farming. I'm just dramatizing this. &gt;&gt; Because remember in Matthew 25, God doesn't reward the lazy. &gt;&gt; He's coming back now to check on the talents that was given to them. &gt;&gt; And the one that invested, he gave more. &gt;&gt; The one that did nothing and buried it, he said, "Cast them out. You're not good to work in my kingdom." So always walk with what God gives you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So in 1 Chronicles chapter 4 there you see that Jabth is a man of vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's more honorable than his brethren and his mother called his name Jabz because I bear with sorrow. His mother wanted him to be a sorrowful person all his life. &gt;&gt; But this man had a man of vision. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, according to the laws, he wasn't supposed to ask for more land, &gt;&gt; more territory. He was supposed to be satisfied with the portion that was marked out for him. &gt;&gt; I am saying even tonight, you can ask God for things impossible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; For things impossible. Somebody was praying here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother David was praying and he was talking about Sunday's message about how Elisha asked for a thing thought impossible. Even Elisha Elishah said you asking for a harmen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; James and John mother. Now these guys for some reason were called the sons of thunder. &gt;&gt; The mother asked for something impossible. &gt;&gt; Grant that they sit at my right, &gt;&gt; one on my left. Ask God for impossible things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's more honorable. So, let's get to the next verse. James Paul and the God of Israel said, "Oh, that thou wouldest bless me indeed." Messy people think I must ask God for blessings. I'm showing your Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, that thou wouldest bless me indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And enlarge my coast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Enlarge my territory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, my vision is too big for this piece of land they've given me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor Denzel, your vision is too big for this classroom. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The word that you're carrying is too big for this place. &gt;&gt; So God has enlarged your territory. &gt;&gt; God has spend it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh that th my call and that thy hand would be made might be with me and that thou will keep me from evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that it will not grieve me. Whatever you going to bless me with, don't let it hinder my faith. &gt;&gt; You know that if you &gt;&gt; when people are rich and increase with good, that's when they turn away from God. But if you can handle it, &gt;&gt; God will bless you and reward you. &gt;&gt; And God granted him that which he requested. He bypassed protocols. He didn't go to the elders. &gt;&gt; He didn't go to the leaders, the tribal leaders and ask them. He went to the heavenlies. &gt;&gt; He contacted the higher power. And the Bible says God granted him that which he requested. I'm asking you, what is it that you want? &gt;&gt; What is it that you want? &gt;&gt; Don't put limitations on your vision. &gt;&gt; Ask God for things impossible. &gt;&gt; Ask God for big things. You know, Sam was one of the doctors that treated brother Brana. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he wanted this building. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he couldn't get this building because it was tied up in legal issues. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "I pray about it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't know if it was the next day or the next week or something. Saturday calls back the prophet. &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't know what happened, but all the legal work came right and now I'm a proud owner of this building." [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You sitting there, you're coming now with a borrowed car to church. M &gt;&gt; everyone will speak you up. What happened to your own car? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be a man of vision. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you don't have a car, go hire a car. &gt;&gt; If you're driving a Uno and you're a man of vision for a Mercedes, &gt;&gt; it's cheaper for you to hire a car for one day. &gt;&gt; Save your money. Hire the car for one day. &gt;&gt; And sit in it. &gt;&gt; Envision yourself in it. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You want to show that you didn't pass the &gt;&gt; sit in it, &gt;&gt; feel it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And say, "Lord, this is what I want." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Start with a simple act of faith. What did say Abraham did? Sarah sold them &gt;&gt; bes. &gt;&gt; Prepare for it already. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a time for preparation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, message people like to lie. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm here to cast out demons this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As long as they're taking chronic medication, they say they're not sick. &gt;&gt; They got it under control. &gt;&gt; You are masking your symptoms. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm here to every pressure tablet, every cholesterol tablet, anything must be. &gt;&gt; We can't mask what Jesus did on prayer &gt;&gt; until we are fine. We are managing the symptoms. &gt;&gt; No, let's leave all your medication and see how fine you are. and let's get back to the cross and what Jesus Christ did and let's bring back what he's there because she had a cyst in the other ovary. She was there because she had a cyst in the other ovary &gt;&gt; and there was another one with a blood problem and all of them had blood problems or blood issues or something you know &gt;&gt; severely bad with them. &gt;&gt; So it was the Thursday and I I was free. So I said okay I'm going to go to the hospital just to pray for her and I took the scripture 1 Peter 2:24. I have seen more miracles with this scripture &gt;&gt; than any other scripture I've &gt;&gt; read over people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just stood by a bedside. Her husband was there and her two daughters, they even have the for some reason one of the daughters recorded the prayer. &gt;&gt; So if you go here to pray, it's not some super duper &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; screaming and shouting. He's just standing quietly by the bed and praying, &gt;&gt; but praying as a son. &gt;&gt; Knowing our position, &gt;&gt; how do we pray according to the word? Amen. &gt;&gt; Anything we're going to do now, I when I told you about promotion, I gave you the scripture for promotion. &gt;&gt; When I told you about being poor, I gave you the scripture for &gt;&gt; Abraham. See, &gt;&gt; it's all by the word. You apply the word. You you you summon heaven and you tell them back the word of God. &gt;&gt; Report back the word of God. &gt;&gt; It will not return void. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I prayed the prayer of faith &gt;&gt; and after I prayed for I said Lord touch these other women in this world. &gt;&gt; Right? Very simple prayer and when I was there it was visiting hours. So there was people talking and you know around there but as I began to pray I noticed the room got very quiet &gt;&gt; because they themselves was hearing the prayer and they went ash. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I left. &gt;&gt; Next day I was at work and around it must have been around 11:00 I get the first message from my sister. Amen. &gt;&gt; She says the doctors have just come into the room. &gt;&gt; You know, they come to look at their patients. &gt;&gt; She says every one of their test results have come back clear &gt;&gt; and they all being discharged immediately. &gt;&gt; An entire world gets discharged. &gt;&gt; Now remember when was there for surgery? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A test result clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they are sitting there now crying with my sister wondering how they are now being discharged. &gt;&gt; The nurses come in there and they start to ask him what happened here. We got no patients to take care of now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are now in the time and season of &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see if you put up sorry pastor I'm just playing with this one scripture. Mark 11:23. &gt;&gt; Amen. Billy Graham didn't unlock the scripture. &gt;&gt; Or Roberts didn't unlock the scripture. &gt;&gt; No theologian unlocked this scripture. A prophet in the woods was pondering upon this scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is our scripture. &gt;&gt; If you want to know how to speak like Adam, this is it. &gt;&gt; The background of the story is this. &gt;&gt; The disciples have watched Jesus speak to a tree. &gt;&gt; He cursed the tree. They come back the next day. They see the tree with it. They asked Jesus a question. How are you able to speak to that tree and it &gt;&gt; Jesus is now going to give us the key &gt;&gt; of how to speak like Adam? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the scripture church we need to apply. &gt;&gt; Whosoever who feels like a whosoever here tonight &gt;&gt; shall say to this mountain here &gt;&gt; straight away. I'm just going to break the scripture out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; First problem we had. Remember consecration is very important. &gt;&gt; Jesus prayed morning time, he prayed noon, evening time and he prayed noon time. &gt;&gt; He prayed even at midnight. &gt;&gt; But show me in the Bible one place when anyone came to him and Jesus prayed for them. &gt;&gt; So consecration is your secret time with the Lord. Even Jesus says don't come like the Pharisees public make wrong prayers. &gt;&gt; What we do? &gt;&gt; We would pray to the mountain. remember the mountain is typing your sickness, your circumstance, your change of circumstance, whatever you're going through, &gt;&gt; so whatever you're going through in that instant as a son of God, the Bible is saying to the mountain, &gt;&gt; not praying to the mountain, &gt;&gt; you should already be praying up. &gt;&gt; You're telling me Joshua to say, "Oh, just stop killing my people here. I just want to go pray with you." &gt;&gt; No. When God calls you in the midst of the heat of the son, stand still and move you still. &gt;&gt; Command the situation. I'm telling you, you have the power, the legal authority on the earth. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Say to the mountain, number one, be thou removed &gt;&gt; and not only tell it what to do, but tell it where to go. &gt;&gt; You can't cast out demons and not tell it where to go. Because even Jesus says whatever you bind on earth is bound in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth is bound in a loose in heaven. Even the pigs wanted instruction from Jesus. Can we go into the pigs? &gt;&gt; Sorry. The demon powers there that was in the man of Gera. &gt;&gt; You want to know where you casting us out where we must go? &gt;&gt; There's some pigs here. Can we go? &gt;&gt; He's telling you speak to your situation. Tell it what to do and where to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's the key now because remember doubt came in the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus is telling them don't doubt in your heart. &gt;&gt; Whatever you speak what it because out of the abundance of the out of the mouth speak &gt;&gt; so your heart confession has gotten me coming out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; How was Joshua going to be successful? &gt;&gt; Keep my word in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't doubt in your heart but shall believe those things which he had said shall come to pass. He shall have whatsoever he saith. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you say, you shall have it. &gt;&gt; But you got to know how to apply the scripture. &gt;&gt; You got to know how to speak to it. Tell it what to do, where to go. &gt;&gt; You got to believe your own words that are coming out of your own mouth. &gt;&gt; Romans 10:9, if you put it up there, if you believe in your heart, confess with your &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how the law works. &gt;&gt; All I'm giving you is principles. Yes. &gt;&gt; A principle is a law, universal law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If for if you're taking gravity, if I throw an apple up here, it must come down according to gravity. The law of gravity. &gt;&gt; You take the same apple and throw it up in the USA, it will come down. &gt;&gt; So God's law is applied anytime, &gt;&gt; anywhere, if it's applied by faith. &gt;&gt; In closing, I would tell you this. There's nothing more your pastor and I can teach you in the word. &gt;&gt; Brother, the brother revealed all the mysteries of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know all the message. &gt;&gt; You know all the mysteries. &gt;&gt; You got 1,200 sermons. You even can download the table. You can have access to it. &gt;&gt; What can more can we teach you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need afraid to believe the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fact that you're sitting here on a Monday means you believe the word. &gt;&gt; You receive the word. &gt;&gt; You're not afraid to believe the word. &gt;&gt; You don't need a frame to receive the word. &gt;&gt; What's missing? Afraid to apply the word. &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a good hand of praise. [Applause] Shall we stand together? Amen. &gt;&gt; We love him. &gt;&gt; We appreciate you tonight. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, we thank God for his grace tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam lost the Holy Ghost. Amen. And when God gave man the Holy Ghost, he gave him dominion over the earth. &gt;&gt; And what is God destroying again? &gt;&gt; He's destroying the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And God is destroying the Holy Ghost in the church, &gt;&gt; then the church will have dominion again. &gt;&gt; If the church does not have dominion, &gt;&gt; then redemption is incomplete. &gt;&gt; Then redemption has failed. Because if he's destroying man back to what Adam was man again must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. The baptism of the Holy Ghost must have dominion. &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight you've heard the word being ministered. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to take your position. &gt;&gt; You have to enlarge your borders, enlarge your vision for yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to see yourself as healer. You have seen yourself. You can't see yourself. But you have to change tonight. Amen. The word has come. The word has been preached. I believe we have heard the word tonight. Amen. Like God servant has said, we don't have to we don't need to have faith hearing this message. We have to have faith now applying the message. So now it's applying time. Amen. You came tonight. You have heard. But what will you do with what we have heard tonight? Amen. Will you leave it in the preacher's hand? Will you leave it back in the church? Or will you apply it tonight? [Applause] I'm so great expectation. I know tonight if there's somebody tonight that can raise up to that place and the word tonight, you will be your victorious tonight. You will be your deliverance tonight. Tonight, you will have tomorrow. Whoever wants to be healed, I've been delivered. We have this energy tonight and we receive the word in the power that it has come tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank God for his grace and his mercy. We're going to sing. Victory is mine. &gt;&gt; Victory is yours. &gt;&gt; I prom behind victory today is mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, victory is mine. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh Happiness is happiness. Oh happ. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh my god. [Music] [Music] My [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] is my Jesus is my [Music] Jesus. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure each one has got your portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. receive a portion tonight the first night of our consecration week. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I believe and I'm under great expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For what God already started doing &gt;&gt; and what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; It's one thing that I took from the sermon this uh evening. Adam like the quote said, Adam had the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That was the right spirit. That was the spirit that God put into him and that's what made him a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And um Adam lost the Holy Ghost. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then God on the uh day of Pentecost, he said, "I'm going to restore man." &gt;&gt; And man couldn't be restored under the blood of &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God said resurrection of man means giving him back what Adam lost, which is a baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The day of Pentecost, God did not give anything else &gt;&gt; to the church but the Holy Ghost. by the tree of fire. He says, "This is all that you need for your journey. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost, that's what Adam lost." That's what you will that that's what will be restored. &gt;&gt; And if Adam with the Holy Ghost had dominion, brothers and sisters, you the Holy Ghost and we have to challenge our situation. &gt;&gt; How you hold your token over your prayer &gt;&gt; and the token is the Holy Ghost. When you hold your token, we will go in prayer. He says, "God hers token and gives you dominion over your situation." &gt;&gt; Tonight we are starting off with saying, "Lord, I know I have many needs, but what I want the most tonight is what Adam [Applause] can have." [Music] &gt;&gt; We bow our heads and close our eyes. We're going to pray for a few minutes before we close. My father, we are so thankful. We are so grateful to guide you. And once again,
