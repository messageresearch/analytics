[0:40] deliver us all thankful amen for the air
[0:43] conditioning a little bit until escom

[0:51] Christ amen welcome you Amen brother reg

[0:57] with Pastor Leon amen Pastor Leon is
[0:59] working he couldn't be a tonight amen so
[1:01] there was a change in schedule many of
[1:03] you wondering why I'm standing here to
[1:04] preach there was a change in schedule
[1:06] amen the brother had to leave back to
[1:07] his country amen so you won't be
[1:09] ministering here tonight but things that
[1:12] are not in our control is in God's
[1:14] control amen so praise the Lord
[1:18] amen so if you were disappointed I mean
[1:21] you were going to come to church
[1:24] anyway amen so praise the Lord let's
[1:26] turn to our
[1:28] Bibles
[1:32] amen I listened to Sunday service
[1:35] tremendously blessed I believe you were
[1:36] blessed as well amen we had a wonderful
[1:38] time with the Believers in momas as well
[1:41] amen
[1:44] hallelujah amen we we can read uh amen
[1:48] let's read Ecclesiastes 3 and verse
[1:57] 1 the Bible says in ecclesiast
[2:00] 3:1 to everything there is a season and
[2:04] a time to every purpose under the heaven
[2:08] amen so there's a season for everything
[2:09] in our lives and a time to every purpose
[2:12] under the heaven amen hallelujah we'll
[2:16] read Daniel 2: 21 as
[2:19] well just a small portion of that
[2:22] scripture Daniel 2: 211 says and he
[2:26] changeth the times and the seasons amen
[2:30] amen so somebody's in control of these
[2:32] things amen
[2:34] hallelujah and then we go to Galatians
[2:39] 6:9 amen Galatians chapter 6 and
[2:43] ver9 let us not grow weary in well doing
[2:47] for in due season we shall reap if we
[2:50] faint not amen hallelujah that word Fain
[2:55] doesn't mean like faint fall down and
[2:56] because you're weak amen don't have
[2:58] strength it means you must continue in
[3:01] patience
[3:03] amen let us not grow weary in well doing
[3:06] for in due season we shall reap amen if
[3:09] we Fain not one more verse of scripture
[3:11] in Timothy chap
[3:13] 4:2
[3:16] amen hallelujah 2 Timothy 4:2 says
[3:20] preach the word be instant in
[3:24] season and out of season amen amen so
[3:28] the preacher got to be season always and
[3:31] then when things get out of season he's
[3:32] got to be able to step into out of
[3:34] season as well reprove rebuke exalt with
[3:37] all love longsuffering and Doctrine amen
[3:41] the Lord had blessings with the reading
[3:42] of his word you may be seated amen
[3:47] hallelujah amen we'll just title the
[3:50] seasons hallelujah amen so we are
[3:54] thankful to the Lord amen that he's able
[3:56] to reveal himself to us we know we are
[3:59] living in a time in a season that is
[4:01] called hours time amen ours Time season
[4:05] is different to the start of the season
[4:09] when they sewing that's right amen
[4:11] hallelujah there's a different group of
[4:13] people on the field at our time than
[4:16] those that were sewing amen hallelujah
[4:20] there's a different amen function for
[4:23] the people that were sewing and there's
[4:25] a different function for the people that
[4:27] are reaping
[4:28] now so we we find that there are
[4:30] constant references in the Bible to
[4:32] Seasons and our lives the prophet will
[4:35] say as different seasons and
[4:37] Cycles amen hallelujah if I can read a
[4:40] quote in The Invisible Union of the
[4:42] bride of
[4:43] Christ in paragraph 55 brother Bram says
[4:47] we are families every family in here is
[4:50] customed to that sometimes everything
[4:52] will run fine for you for
[4:55] years then all at once you hit a spell
[4:59] where everything goes wrong right we say
[5:02] it many times in the South year when it
[5:05] rains it pours and you're going through
[5:07] a night time then there's a day break
[5:10] then a night time everything runs in
[5:14] continuity amen so we find that our
[5:17] lives will have seasons if we if we cast
[5:19] our memory back to our own lives we will
[5:22] see that there's been seasons of highs
[5:24] seasons of lows if you have to look in
[5:26] your spiritual life you'll also see that
[5:29] sometimes you walking in spiritual
[5:30] lights but if you can also find the low
[5:33] seasons in your life I want you to know
[5:35] the low seasons in your life was because
[5:37] you allowed yourself to get
[5:40] there it was not God's will for you to
[5:42] be there amen
[5:46] amen and if you can hear the theme of
[5:49] the services that are coming out it was
[5:52] because of the lack of
[5:55] consecration
[5:57] amen because that's what's require Reed
[6:00] submission to the holy spirit amen but
[6:03] we get so comfortable and over the years
[6:05] as time has transpired we got so
[6:08] comfortable with the message of the hour
[6:10] and we got comfortable thinking that we
[6:11] are safe just by saying that we believe
[6:14] the message of the hour not realizing
[6:16] that a consecrated life is what is
[6:18] required for the Holy Ghost to have the
[6:20] preeminence
[6:22] amen amen so life will have seasons now
[6:27] if we look at the life of Joseph we'll
[6:28] see Jose Joseph's lives can be typed out
[6:30] in Seasons we can say like four seasons
[6:36] amen hallelujah hallelujah he's the
[6:39] favorite of his father that's one season
[6:41] of his life then he's a
[6:45] prisoner
[6:46] amen sorry not a prisoner then he's a
[6:50] servant in part of his house so from the
[6:53] favorite in his father's house he goes
[6:55] to being a servant then he becomes a
[6:58] prisoner and then he becomes we call him
[7:00] the king of the country right because
[7:03] the king didn't do anything he left
[7:04] everything in charge of Joseph in charge
[7:07] of everything now watch something here
[7:09] The Four Seasons are marked by four
[7:12] garments in his father's house he had a
[7:14] court of Many
[7:16] Colors amen hallelujah his father
[7:18] favored him in that season now you
[7:21] notice something there God gives him a
[7:23] vision or a dream in that season of his
[7:26] life and he's not showing him his
[7:29] journey through life yeah but God is
[7:31] showing him the end result amen and he's
[7:34] showing him in the form of a dream that
[7:36] how everybody is coming to bow on before
[7:40] him so that's the vision you must hold
[7:42] before him amen he can't be deterred by
[7:45] any other thing that happens in his life
[7:48] and as soon as he reveals the dream to
[7:50] his father and to his brothers jealousy
[7:53] arises amen hallelujah so we find the
[7:57] season moves very quickly and it your
[7:59] season in your life that you're going
[8:01] through can move people to jealousy to
[8:04] bitterness to
[8:07] Envy amen just because you are walking
[8:11] in your season doesn't mean everybody
[8:13] else is going to applaud
[8:15] you amen but God is testing our
[8:18] character God is testing us and taking
[8:20] us through these trials to show you that
[8:23] I am walking with you and you don't have
[8:25] to rely on anybody else and even when
[8:28] things go downhill and they throw you
[8:30] into a pit know that I will never leave
[8:32] you nor will I forsake
[8:34] you amen through the changing season
[8:37] maybe it's springtime and you can see
[8:39] the season
[8:42] changing amen hallelujah I want you you
[8:46] know the Bible says maybe one of you can
[8:48] find the scripture just coming to mind
[8:50] now that God will not give you more than
[8:52] you can
[8:54] handle but with the Temptation he will
[8:56] provide a way of Escape for you amen
[9:00] amen
[9:01] hallelujah so imagine now you get a
[9:04] dream like this and with very spiritual
[9:07] people around if the if things don't
[9:10] transpire in your life according to the
[9:11] dream what do they label you as
[9:14] false you just had a dream that we buy
[9:16] down before you yes look at what you we
[9:19] done now we we sold you to slavery yes
[9:23] what were they doing they removed one
[9:26] garment his coat of many kind
[9:30] and what was he
[9:32] doing it was a type of
[9:36] Christ Christ was removing his Heavenly
[9:39] garment amen a seven color rainbow
[9:42] garment amen amen hallelujah what was he
[9:45] going to do he was going to move into
[9:48] the next season of his ministry of
[9:50] servanthood Christ was going to become a
[9:52] servant so Joseph's life was typ in
[9:55] Christ so they removed one
[9:57] garment and they give him a garment of a
[10:02] servant amen so no longer now he has
[10:06] memories of his father's house and he
[10:09] has memories of his father's garments
[10:11] and you find the in that transition got
[10:14] to try and get away from this now this
[10:15] thing is making my voice horse amen
[10:20] hallelujah but I I don't want to turn
[10:23] that off for you because it's going to
[10:24] turn off very soon amen but I can feel
[10:27] my the season of my throat is
[10:32] changing amen
[10:34] hallelujah but it's fine we shall endure
[10:38] amen the brothers were supposed to be at
[10:41] shim
[10:42] s amen you can find it there the father
[10:47] told him that they were there why that
[10:49] place is important it was the first
[10:51] meeting place between God and
[10:53] Abraham and God and Abraham had built
[10:56] God an altar there so it's entire type
[10:59] showing you that the brothers were
[11:01] supposed to be in one
[11:02] position but they had left that place
[11:05] and Joseph meets somebody there who
[11:08] tells him your brothers are no longer
[11:09] here they have gone to Dothan and Dothan
[11:12] means double well so you can see they
[11:16] left the one true God and they went
[11:18] after two Wells amen they went after
[11:22] more Waters they went after more light
[11:25] they went after a trinity Doctrine you
[11:28] can say amen so they left the original
[11:31] place of meeting where God met Abraham
[11:34] and they were gone out of the God's
[11:36] provided place of worship yes amen
[11:41] hallelujah
[11:44] amen so they go to Dothan and it's in
[11:47] between this thing they atch out a plan
[11:49] to kill not well they wanted to kill him
[11:52] but then you know Reuben steps in and
[11:54] says don't kill him amen and then they
[11:55] sold him to Slaves so it's in this thing
[11:58] they they take the coat and they put
[12:00] animal Blood on the coat now watch
[12:03] something they deceive their father who
[12:05] is their
[12:09] father amen many of you are saying it
[12:12] right it's one man with two names some
[12:14] are saying Jacob some are saying
[12:17] Israel and is Jacob
[12:20] deceived into
[12:22] thinking that is this is Joseph's blood
[12:26] it was the coat remember the coat was
[12:29] right but the blood was
[12:31] wrong amen hallelujah but wasn't he the
[12:38] one that deceived his
[12:42] father with what he put a garment
[12:49] of right what am I trying to show you
[12:51] gar changing of garments represent
[12:54] changing of Seasons because when he put
[12:56] that garment to show his father that he
[12:58] was Esau it was going to change their
[13:01] season of their lives he had to
[13:04] flee and Esau season changed he was no
[13:08] longer at the
[13:09] birthright in the
[13:11] family Esau season changed when Jacob
[13:15] put on a garment of a sheep or whatever
[13:18] skin it
[13:20] was you get what I'm trying to say a
[13:23] garment represents change what did they
[13:25] try and do in Eden they tried to put on
[13:28] a garment yes it was changing of season
[13:32] amen
[13:32] [Music]
[13:34] hallelujah so we find here he takes they
[13:37] strip him off this seven colored robe
[13:40] and they put
[13:43] on a servant
[13:46] Rob Christ putting on the form of a
[13:49] servant they put him in part of his
[13:51] house and he becomes the chief of all
[13:55] servants but his his is is uh Destiny
[13:58] ation is not to be the chief of all
[14:01] servants in the father's house Christ's
[14:04] destination was not to be the master of
[14:07] all men here on Earth in a flesh
[14:10] body he had to move Amen to souls that
[14:14] were in prison he had to go to a grave
[14:16] beyond the grave
[14:18] Ministry amen so Joseph couldn't stay
[14:21] there because he was typing Christ he
[14:23] couldn't stay in the role of servanthood
[14:26] even though he was excelling at it
[14:28] wasn't Jesus excelling at his uh task of
[14:31] being the Redeemer on
[14:33] Earth amen he was the master of all
[14:35] circumstance he was the god
[14:38] man they didn't know what to do with
[14:42] Jesus am amen he was excelling just like
[14:46] Joseph was
[14:49] excelling and then we find that now what
[14:53] happens watch the Garment again he's now
[14:56] got a prisoners garment but somebody
[14:58] strips him off that garment part of his
[15:03] wife and does that change his
[15:07] season it changes the season because
[15:10] they now move him from part of his house
[15:12] into the prison
[15:15] house and do he get new clothes in the
[15:17] prison house he gets prisoners
[15:21] clothes amen hallelujah changing of
[15:25] garments so he's moving amen hallelujah
[15:28] Christ moved from that veil of Flesh
[15:31] amen and he went back amen the body lay
[15:33] in the grave and he moved into his
[15:35] theophonic body and he went to preach to
[15:38] souls that were in
[15:40] prison amen amen a changing of season
[15:44] but he wasn't only going to preach to
[15:46] souls that were in prison he was going
[15:48] to take back the keys of death of hell
[15:51] and the
[15:53] grave amen hallelujah but he was
[15:56] positionally placed there because he was
[15:59] going to move from the lowest of the
[16:02] palace the lowest of all places
[16:06] death he would have died
[16:09] there
[16:11] amen if it had not been for the Butler
[16:13] and the
[16:14] baker amen hallelujah but God had
[16:17] positioned him there for his specific
[16:19] purpose and he excelled even in there
[16:21] and they made him the Lord of all the
[16:26] prisoners amen Hal ujah
[16:30] amen you
[16:33] know Jesus Christ reconciled something
[16:37] that had never been done before let me
[16:39] tell you what this is when God made man
[16:43] he said I'll be God of the heavens you
[16:46] be God on the earth I'll make you an
[16:49] amateure God he says You must have
[16:51] dominion over the Earth
[16:55] man but Jesus
[16:57] Christ
[16:59] amen so if God wanted to do anything on
[17:01] the earth he has to work by a man yes
[17:04] that's why the Holy Spirit can only work
[17:06] in cooperation with man who submit
[17:08] themselves to him amen amen hallelujah
[17:12] so we find here Jesus Christ changed
[17:16] everything because the Bible
[17:19] says amen that all power is given unto
[17:23] this man Jesus Christ in heaven and on
[17:26] earth now there's a man who can control
[17:29] Heaven and
[17:32] Earth
[17:34] am Jesus just switched it up am amen
[17:38] hallelujah there's a man now who has
[17:41] control over the heavens and the
[17:43] Earth amen hallelujah maybe you didn't
[17:46] Rejoice too much about that but I want
[17:49] you to know that you are join ears with
[17:51] Jesus Christ I want you to know that
[17:54] Jesus also said whatever you bind on
[17:56] Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[17:58] whatever you lose on Earth shall be Loos
[18:00] in heaven amen he came to unlock keys so
[18:04] that you can
[18:06] operate not only that amen if he's made
[18:09] you the married wife if he's told you
[18:11] you that overcome on the earth if you
[18:13] overcome this latest here in church is
[18:15] even as I overcame and I'm sat down in
[18:17] my father's Throne so if you overcome
[18:19] you can sit with me on my Throne amen
[18:22] let me tell you a queen can also operate
[18:25] in her Authority amen like Queen Esther
[18:28] amen but you need to know that you are
[18:30] the Queen of Heaven am
[18:33] hallelujah
[18:34] amen amen so what did it it took Jesus
[18:38] death his burial and his
[18:40] resurrection because when he rose again
[18:42] he rose triumphant he says all power in
[18:46] heaven and on Earth is given unto
[18:49] me now nothing can be done in heaven
[18:52] nothing can be done on Earth without
[18:54] Jesus
[18:55] Christ he's the king of kings he's the
[18:58] Lord of lords amen he's the Prince of
[19:01] Peace he's the Mighty God he's the
[19:03] mighty conqueror Lord amen what a
[19:06] majestic Lord Jesus Christ we serve amen
[19:10] he's the same yesterday today and
[19:11] forever he is unchanging in his ways
[19:14] amen
[19:17] hallelujah so now
[19:20] the part of his wife stripped him of his
[19:25] servant robe and she used the Rob to
[19:29] accuse him bring an accusation and
[19:31] change the season in his life so that he
[19:33] can move to the next point of his
[19:35] ministry what am I trying to show you
[19:38] watch the seasons in your life God has
[19:41] it there for a purpose amen hallelujah
[19:45] but it's important for you not to get
[19:47] stuck in one
[19:48] season amen
[19:51] hallelujah when when God is moving you
[19:53] from one season to the next even though
[19:55] it might seem like it's a harder season
[19:59] I mean from being a servant he went to
[20:01] the prison
[20:04] house I want you to know that it's in
[20:06] your darkest Seasons that the presence
[20:08] of God is the
[20:11] strongest he said I will never leave you
[20:13] nor forsake you in the darkest of hours
[20:17] the light shines
[20:19] brightest amen hallelujah amen you know
[20:23] when Joseph was there wearing this robe
[20:25] of many colors in his father's house
[20:28] amen maybe you couldn't sense the
[20:30] presence of God there but when you're
[20:33] walking through even though I walk
[20:35] through the valley of the shadow of
[20:37] death I will fear no evil thy rod and
[20:41] thy staff they comfort me amen
[20:44] hallelujah so watch your changing season
[20:47] amen hallelujah don't get too
[20:49] comfortable in your season because
[20:51] remember you are moving into a season
[20:54] from mortality to immortality there's a
[20:57] goal here Church there's there's a goal
[20:58] here people of God Amen God has a vision
[21:01] in mind and he's moving you from
[21:02] mortality to
[21:04] immortality doesn't the Apostle Paul
[21:07] talk about changing of garments laying
[21:09] aside this robe of Flesh Amen to put on
[21:12] an immortal garment he wants to change
[21:15] us from a season of mortality to a
[21:18] season of
[21:19] immortality thank you amen God is
[21:22] working with us God is moving us
[21:24] positioning us oh but oh I know it's
[21:28] easy to get Earth bound amen I know it's
[21:30] easy Amen to get comfortable with life
[21:32] to think that this is it I've arrived
[21:34] I've achieved no we haven't
[21:37] achieved we haven't arrived amen God is
[21:40] still fixing to do something in your
[21:41] life amen God is still fixing amen if
[21:44] you can only surrender to the Holy
[21:46] Spirit if you can only get consecrate
[21:48] your life to the Lord allow him to have
[21:51] that
[21:53] work amen praise the Lord glory be to
[21:56] his name amen amen while I'm there just
[22:00] thought of this quote amen if I can just
[22:01] find it quickly for you amen then we can
[22:04] read it amen if you can find the
[22:06] unfailing realities of the Living God
[22:13] Amen if if if we can understand what the
[22:16] prophet of God is telling us here now
[22:17] you got the message
[22:19] amen amen if you can just search that
[22:21] message alone where he says how we've
[22:24] deprived ourselves amen we've deprived
[22:29] ourselves now how many if you think if I
[22:33] say we deprived ourselves we'll all
[22:34] agree right if I say that we can rob God
[22:38] how many of you will
[22:39] agree
[22:41] amen yeah I I know where you are
[22:43] thinking now you are thinking of
[22:44] scripture where have we rob Thee the
[22:46] Bible says in tithes and in offering
[22:48] right but that's not what I'm talking
[22:50] about even though you should be paying
[22:51] your tithes and your offering but that's
[22:52] not where my focus is here what the
[22:54] prophet of God is saying I often thought
[22:57] now let let's pay attention to this it's
[22:59] Deep Thoughts I've often thought how
[23:01] we've deprived ourselves how we've
[23:03] robbed God of his plan how did we rob
[23:06] you Lord by not surrendering Our Lives
[23:09] completely to him yes everything that we
[23:12] have to him how that we have disallowed
[23:15] his
[23:17] program now that's an
[23:21] indictment we have disallowed his
[23:24] program how we've lingered and have made
[23:27] into way wait and wait and wait trying
[23:32] to find somebody that he can work
[23:35] through oh how many if you want to say
[23:37] Lord I I want to
[23:38] surrender amen you know you know
[23:41] sometimes we lie the most to our
[23:44] songs because it's easy Lord I give you
[23:47] my heart I give you my soul
[23:52] relying it's just a song We singing with
[23:56] no meaning amen I surrender
[24:03] all but you don't want to surrender your
[24:08] Z but he says here we made him wait and
[24:13] wait trying to find somebody that he
[24:15] could walk through trying to find a man
[24:18] somewhere that he could put confidence
[24:20] in some man that would surrender
[24:23] everything oh when I read this quote I
[24:25] said Lord I want to be that man how many
[24:27] if you feel that way you want to be that
[24:28] sister you want to be that brother that
[24:31] surrenders
[24:32] everything now I tell you if we really
[24:34] come sincerely tonight I believe the
[24:36] Lord can work through
[24:37] [Music]
[24:39] US
[24:43] amen
[24:44] amen look at how we can rob the Lord
[24:48] look at how we can stop his
[24:49] program disallow his program how we've
[24:53] lingered made him wait why because of
[24:56] our stubbornness
[25:03] amen if we can find the resurrection of
[25:06] J's
[25:07] daughter
[25:10] amen the resurrection of J's

[25:49] the key if you want to know the key to
[25:52] the power of God this is
[25:54] it amen let's read it from there now if
[25:58] a person now put your name there
[26:01] completely surrendered to the devil will
[26:03] give him twice his strength you know
[26:05] many times you were testimonies of this
[26:08] you
[26:09] see demon powers and the spirit of God
[26:14] can only work with men who submit
[26:17] themselves have you ever seen the Holy
[26:19] Spirit overpower you and force you to
[26:21] use your body what does he always tell
[26:23] us the holy spirit is

[26:29] same with demon powers you say I got
[26:31] possessed with the demon power you know

[27:18] person maybe I remember the testimony
[27:21] brother Joshua telling about the
[27:22] strength of this man that they were
[27:24] facing then the prophet also tell us
[27:26] about the man that came there on the
[27:27] stage to challenge him he says the devil
[27:30] will give him twice his strength when a
[27:32] man he says what will a man completely
[27:35] surrender to God do
[27:37] See it'll make you so weak maybe you're
[27:41] crippled and can't stand up but
[27:43] surrender yourself to God and New Life a
[27:47] new strength comes

[28:08] walk around through the house praising
[28:11] God and get

[37:33] rent let me declare to
[37:35] you if you want to live in the economy
[37:38] of South Africa it's
[37:41] fine that's right but there's an economy
[37:44] within an
[37:47] economy you see in our world the South
[37:51] African economy may be the greatest
[37:54] thing on our mind how to exist within
[37:56] the South African economy and how
[37:59] whether I exist in the lower income the
[38:01] middle class or the upper
[38:03] class but you know there's an economy
[38:06] within
[38:08] economy you see the South African
[38:11] economy is trying to cope with the
[38:13] American economy every economy is trying
[38:16] to cope with one another but I want you
[38:18] to know all of the economies of the
[38:20] world are existing within the greater
[38:23] economy of God's
[38:25] economy amen
[38:27] who sets up kingdoms who brings them
[38:29] down amen let me show you something when
[38:34] Elijah said there shall not be rain for
[38:36] 3 and 1 half years unless I call for it
[38:40] what happened there he changed times and
[38:44] season yes
[38:47] amen God kept him there by the Brook and
[38:51] he was being fed yes God could have kept
[38:54] him in that season but what how God
[38:57] moved him out of that season because
[38:59] when he arrives to This Woman's house
[39:01] she was on her
[39:03] last meal and oil I'm telling you God
[39:08] could have kept him there and continue
[39:11] to provide for him for that time and
[39:14] period but a woman was in
[39:19] need now the economy of Israel was
[39:23] failing whether she worked or not she
[39:25] wouldn't have been able to buy meal
[39:27] because there was no meal there was no
[39:29] oil to buy amen so what did she tell him
[39:33] we are going to eat this thing and we
[39:36] are going to
[39:37] die how many of you have ever come into
[39:39] that point in your life where you knew
[39:41] it was your last meal and after that you
[39:43] were
[39:44] dead so none of us have been put in that
[39:47] position amen hallelujah but I want you
[39:50] to see
[39:52] something at that point when all hope
[39:55] was gone
[39:58] God's economy came into
[40:01] effect I don't think you understand what
[40:03] I'm
[40:05] saying whether the South African economy
[40:07] fails or not whether the Israel economy
[40:10] failed on that day or not in God's
[40:14] economy the cruise of oil and the barrel
[40:18] of meal never ran
[40:21] down God can make you prosper in his
[40:25] economy even though economies around you
[40:27] are
[40:28] falling but it depends on what economy
[40:31] you want to choose to dwell
[40:33] in you see you can choose to dwell in
[40:36] the economy of your bank
[40:38] balance and that can really make you
[40:42] sad can really make you depressed
[40:45] because you're operating by what you see
[40:47] but I'm if you know that we've been

[40:51] Unseen amen hallelujah amen sometimes
