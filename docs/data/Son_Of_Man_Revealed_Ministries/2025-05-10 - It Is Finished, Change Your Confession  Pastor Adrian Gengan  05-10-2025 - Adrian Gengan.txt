========================================

Let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10. Brother Josh, you get my notes. Amen. Praise the Lord. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10. For we are his workmanship. Now we got to tie this with Genesis 1 26 27 when he said, "Let us make man in our image." &gt;&gt; Then he did it right in 27. He actually did it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God created man. Now he's saying we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take some time to think about that. &gt;&gt; We were created in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if Jesus is perfect, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am perfect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I know your church thinking and your uh creed and your thing think things that you still need to do something to be perfect. &gt;&gt; That is a lie. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We are already perfected in Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We have already made the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ has already predestinated us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I want to take that denominational concept and chop it now to the roots. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Pluck it by the root. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them. &gt;&gt; How about we walk in perfection? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not striving to be holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's that's striving to do good works. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I am already holy because Christ is holy. &gt;&gt; I am already perfect because Christ is perfect. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2 and verse 6. &gt;&gt; And hath raised us up together. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And made us sit together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In heavenly places, &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been talking about the headstone. &gt;&gt; We've been talking about how we have now connected to the headstone. Yes, &gt;&gt; we find that's called heavenly places &gt;&gt; and we are finding that it is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; So the rip that was taken from Jesus has been put back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not disconnected from Jesus. &gt;&gt; I am connected with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Lord is blessing through the reading of his word. You may be seated. Hallelujah. You know this morning I feel such a fresh anointing. Amen. &gt;&gt; I feel like there's a shift in the atmosphere this morning. &gt;&gt; I feel like all that we have labored through the months. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit's about to shift the gear this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that's according to my expectation. &gt;&gt; And as the pastor of the church, I'm here to lead you in a vision this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Where there's no vision, the people perish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't be a dead church. &gt;&gt; We can't be a church coming to hear sermon this morning. But we've got to be at church. Amen. Where we become the walking sermon. &gt;&gt; People go to church week after week. They go and listen to a sermon. They walk out confused. They don't know what the pastor preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; According to me, Revelation 10, the prophet revealed all the mysteries. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what we are saying is we are moving from nine months of teaching, we have moved into the last quarter. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to know this is not a university. &gt;&gt; This is not a university. &gt;&gt; If you want to call it anything, this is a trade school. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where whatever you learn, there's a period now where it must be applied. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're not going through nine months of teaching and preaching, brother Joshua, for us to not have practical &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm saying all that we learned we need to apply. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the last quarter, Amen. In this season, you must expect to see the expression of everything we have learned. &gt;&gt; If we spoke about the opening of dimensional doors, we must already walk through that door. &gt;&gt; If we're speaking about getting into heavenly places, now is the time you're going to see the expression of us sitting together in heavenly places. How will it manifest? In the power and the demonstration of the word. in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So all you have believed for and prepared for will come to pass in this season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now remember what the prophet of God says. He says, "A prophet is a modern day preacher." &gt;&gt; All that you believe for and all you prepared for will come to pass in this season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A farmer don't plant and water and all the time of preparation not expecting an harvest. &gt;&gt; He is expecting that what he has planted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What he has watered &gt;&gt; what he has labored. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pastor Ronnie planted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The five ministry is watering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we expecting to see an harvest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Excuse me because I don't preach high and fancy stuff. &gt;&gt; I preach very practical that even the children must understand what I am saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when you leave this place, I want you to know that you have been blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So this is the time and this is the season where the revelation of the word will produce a transformation of your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in us, we will start to walk in what we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So what we need to uncover first &gt;&gt; is who we really are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because unless we know who we really are, we can't really have faith. &gt;&gt; The real you was on the inside of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So many times people want to express this flesh. This is who I am. &gt;&gt; They attach it to a family name. &gt;&gt; Me I'm from the Musamis. &gt;&gt; Me I'm from the governors. M &gt;&gt; me I'm from the chetties &gt;&gt; or me I'm from the gangs whoever it is no we are expressing then just the old cult &gt;&gt; we're not expressing the real me because my gene has a name &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; my gene has an identification &gt;&gt; and genetically my name is Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; genetically my name is Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; praise Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what makes us different from just the church world? Do you know everyone is dying? All of us are dying. &gt;&gt; But we are carrying something eternal within our souls. &gt;&gt; That's the difference between us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We may look like everyone else. We may age like everyone else. But we are not like everyone else. &gt;&gt; He says a Christian does not die. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; First thing is we mustn't consider this was change our language now to say we die. We don't die. &gt;&gt; The Bible when it's referencing death calls us asleep. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's no scripture that a Christian dies because he's got eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When a sinner dies, he's finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His soul will finally die. &gt;&gt; But when a Christian dies, he's just waiting for Jesus to return back again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon goes on to say in the interval, your soul is the part of God that's in you. &gt;&gt; Want to resurrect that seed that's been planted for 9 months. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Then the prophet will go on. I'm just trying to show you something here now because people think why do we get sick then if you're saying eternal life is a part of me. &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet is saying now. Divine healing and salvation for the soul is not on the same basis. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus died that he might save us. When we saved, we saved eternally. &gt;&gt; I can't be lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know when Jesus saved me, the Bible says while we were yet in sin, Christ died for us. &gt;&gt; He already looked down through the ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he died on Calvary, he forgave me for all of those sins. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I thank you Lord that the blood still stands. Oh God, I thank you already forgiven me of my sin. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; The devil wants to keep us that we are continual sinners. No. When Christ died for us, he did a work that even on the cross, what did he say, brother Jeff? He said it is finished. &gt;&gt; We are thinking there's something we need to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There is nothing we can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is not one thing we can do &gt;&gt; to add to our salvation. &gt;&gt; That's why we are in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ did it all. &gt;&gt; And now when we are changing our mindset, the kingdom of hell cannot stand against us because we are not depending on our own works, on our own humanness, but we are depending on what Christ has done for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should never go to God and say, "Lord, heal me. Heal me." You are nullifying the work on the cross. &gt;&gt; Christ has already healed you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ has already saved us. So Jesus died that he might save us. When we saved, we saved eternally. But when we heal physically, we'll get sick again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? But the soul is the immortal part. He that heareth my word believeth on him that sent me, amen, everlast everlasting life, and shall never come to the judgment, but is passed from death unto life. That settles it. Then when we're born again, we're a new creature, and that soul is a part of God, the eternal life that comes from the Greek word Zoe, which means God's own life. That makes us sons and daughters of God. Now, how many of you believe you are sons and daughters of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's saying the only way we can become sons and daughters of God in Zoe life is in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So our confession needs to change. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If we are sons of God, Zoe life lives in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're sick in your physical body until this body has been redeemed, it's subject to sickness again. &gt;&gt; Now pay attention. Your body is subject to sickness again, but there's a price that was already paid for you to receive your healing again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, here's what I'm trying to convey to you this morning. That everything that we will ever need in this life, Christ has already done it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, when Christ chose to take you in the rapture, &gt;&gt; he already knew at the point of your body change what job you had. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hear what I'm saying now? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right now, you may be in a certain position. &gt;&gt; But when Christ chose to rapture you, you are already doing something. &gt;&gt; Whatever you eat, it's already done. He says what would he do if he was standing here? How many of you would come now to Jesus and say heal me? This is not going to be a repeat of the book of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. &gt;&gt; If you are thinking you're going to come there and touch them off his garment and say, "Lord, heal me. Heal me." You are nullifying the work on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't say, "Hey, that's my place in the Bible. I'm going to crawl on my knees and go touch his garment." Nothing will happen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I told you this is not practical. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Practical. When he say come here and let me heal you, he couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He could not do it because he's already done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, he's already did it. By his stripes, you were healed. &gt;&gt; Put up 1 Peter 2:24 there. Amen. By his stripes, you were healed. He didn't say, "Don't you believe that I died for you back then?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's hear what the Bible is saying now. 1 Peter 2:24. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we be dead to sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So devil, don't come and whisper in my ear that I'm a sinner. I am dead to sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let me see the righteous ones of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now, people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've got to confess what we believe. &gt;&gt; We are not righteous based on our own good works. We are righteous because of what Jesus done. And if we are in Christ, we are righteous. &gt;&gt; If we are in Christ, we are holy. &gt;&gt; If we are in Christ, we are perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "What kind of Christianity is this?" There's no part for me to play. The part for us to do is to believe that Christ has done it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should live unto righteousness. You know what the defeist mentality is? You know the the the prodical son that came back to the father. &gt;&gt; What was what mentality did he have? He said, "I want to be avant." &gt;&gt; He had servant mentality. &gt;&gt; What did the father promote his thoughts to? &gt;&gt; I'm restoring you back to sunship. &gt;&gt; There is therefore now no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To everyone. No. &gt;&gt; To them which are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; No condemnation. &gt;&gt; Who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. Do you know what that means &gt;&gt; in legal terms? &gt;&gt; There's a case brought before the father &gt;&gt; to condemn us. &gt;&gt; And the judgment is &gt;&gt; the case is closed. &gt;&gt; There is no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; To them which are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Case dismissed. Christ already did it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am victorious in Christ. We need to change our confession. I am already victorious. I have already won. Is practical. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Change your mentality. &gt;&gt; Change what you what is coming out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; You're moving into practicals. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That there can't be a sick person laying here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. that even if brother way falls dead this morning, the power is here within us. &gt;&gt; To say, "Brother Way, &gt;&gt; hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 2:24. Let's just go back to that. Amen. I just want to establish a scripture because this is a scripture I prayed in the hospital when those three sisters got discharged. &gt;&gt; Not sisters. My sister was in the hospital and I prayed this prayer and she got discharged with all clear results and that other lady who was there with that cyst that was going to be removed from a organ was going to be removed because of the cyst and the other one that had a blood problem whatever it was all three of them the next morning the doctor said all your results have came back clear they can all leave today [Applause] &gt;&gt; this is the scripture who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes he were healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan don't want you to know the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You were healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let doctors class you. All my sugar patients stand here. &gt;&gt; All my pressure patient. You are not east patient. &gt;&gt; You're the bloodboard of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let all the heart patients stand here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They label you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has labeled you. You are already healed. You are already sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are my purchased possession. &gt;&gt; The lie of the devil is that you have spots, &gt;&gt; that you have wrinkles. The lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; That you are not perfect. &gt;&gt; That you are still striving for perfection. That's the lie of the devil. That's right. &gt;&gt; Christ has made you without spot, without wrinkle, without blemish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. Now, &gt;&gt; now am I without spot? Now am I without blemish. Now am I without was Eve, Adam and Eve already in the image of God. &gt;&gt; Were they already created beings that they could speak? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. So when he was looking at them through the serpent, they were already that. Yes. &gt;&gt; But he made them believe the lie that you still have something to attain. &gt;&gt; So the lie now is that in this age after the seven seals are open after revelation 10:7 prophet has come and gone that there's still some further work to be done for this church to rise up to its full potential. That's a lie of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Which preacher are you waiting for to give you revelation to rise up in faith? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Which teaching are you not clear about that you need to rise up in faith? &gt;&gt; What we have is people who are not prepared to stand up and apply the word of God. &gt;&gt; To have rugged faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says faith has muscles. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith is belly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith has hair on his chest. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you're looking at a faith in a believer, you're looking at a hairy chested faith being. &gt;&gt; You are looking at a strong muscled man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he he says if you can't if Jesus was here physically say heal me. He says he couldn't do it. He'd say don't you believe that I died for you back there? Don't you believe that? That what? That was me who died yonder for your sickness. Don't you think I was wounded for your transgressions? With my stripes, you were healed. Can't you believe my word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's one thing man can't do. Man cannot forgive sins. And man cannot heal sickness. They can't do something that God has already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man cannot heal sickness. That's something that God has already done. You can't do it. You just have to have faith in the finished work of Christ at Calvary. &gt;&gt; That everything that God can do for you, he's already done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody repeat that. Everything &gt;&gt; Everything &gt;&gt; that God &gt;&gt; that God &gt;&gt; can &gt;&gt; can do for you &gt;&gt; can do for you, &gt;&gt; he's already done it. &gt;&gt; He's already done it. &gt;&gt; So, who's bringing you for promotion? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is he saying? Everything that God can do for you, &gt;&gt; oh, please somebody hear me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is here praying for a marriage partner? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know you don't want to raise your hand because everyone going to see you praying for a marriage partner. You feel shy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. I want to be practical about what I'm talking about because I want you to see the results. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that God can do for you, he's already done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say what to you that God has already seen you take a rapture. &gt;&gt; Which means at the point of the rapture, he already saw whether you were married or not. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He already saw whether you're the next dealer principal. &gt;&gt; He already saw whether you're the next manager. &gt;&gt; He already saw. Amen. If you got that promotion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you getting what I'm trying to tell you? Maybe. Sorry for my maybe I'm not expressing my thoughts properly, but I'm trying to simplify it as best as I can. He already saw you at the point of the rapture. Every blessing that he would give to you. &gt;&gt; So, he's already done it. Amen. &gt;&gt; At the point of the rapture, you are already staying in your five bedroom house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, please raise the level of your faith this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He already saw you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you already saw, it's already done. Yes. &gt;&gt; Then what's our part? Our part is to thank him for already giving it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, if we change our mentality and change our thinking into death, you are going to see what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, while you're here seeking out God for your salvation and for your healing, that everything that God can do for you, he's already done it. Every sin is forgiven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every sin is forgiven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make mistakes. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Confess your sins." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Confess means to agree with. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It comes from a Greek word. &gt;&gt; You know how English comes from Greek. &gt;&gt; It means to agree with. &gt;&gt; So if you're wrong, you got to agree. Yes, I was wrong. That's right. &gt;&gt; But confession also has a positive part. &gt;&gt; The other part of confession is that when we confess, we are saying we agree with God's word and what it says &gt;&gt; and all the promises attached to God's word. We confess God's word. &gt;&gt; Everything. I want you to get that. Everything. &gt;&gt; Some of you sit in your bed and you dream about things probably saying everything that God can do for you, he's already done it. &gt;&gt; He's already done it. Every sin is forgiven. Every sickness is healed. The only thing you have to do is look to Calvary and accept what God has already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There it is. It's already finished. Jesus said at Calvary, it is finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Then if I was saved, h we say we got saved 20 years ago. You know, brother, I got saved 20 years ago. What is he saying? No, I was saved 1900 years ago. lives 2,000 years ago. I just accepted it 20 years ago. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; brother. You know, I was saved 2,000 years ago at the cross, but I received it 20 years ago. &gt;&gt; I received it two Amen. 30 years ago. That's the language now. Amen. God Amen. When Christ died, he paid the penalty of both sin and sickness. And sickness is an attribute of sin. And sin is unbelief. Let that just soak for a moment. Amen. If you go to the scripture, Psalm 75:6, those of you looking for promotion, promotion is not coming from you pleading with your boss. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am telling you, it's already done. &gt;&gt; Promotion is not you going and applying and waiting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say whether you are qualified or not, promotion doesn't come that way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Psalm 275 and 6. For promotion cometh neither from the east &gt;&gt; or from the west nor from the south, but God is the judge. He put it down one and he set it up another. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh let's just go to this quickly. He says the greatest problem. Now I I'm defining &gt;&gt; remember the prophet is preaching to a later and age. &gt;&gt; I don't expect this condition to exist in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I don't expect in this time and season what you're about to read to exist in a world of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem with the Pentecostal church today is positionally they don't know who what they are. &gt;&gt; You're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a whole lot of times you're looking for something great to come, but you already got that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say Malachi 4 has already come and our heart has already been turned back to the freak that was once delivered to the saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for something to come great to come. We already got that. The greatest can be given you. Now, we are sons of God. Not will be, but we are now. And we are seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now. When faith like that gets into the church, the devil moves away from the place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I am telling you this morning that unemployment is illegal. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not according to God's word for somebody to be unemployed. Hear me what I'm saying. Don't get offended, but I take God's word this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And say, Lord, I want to apply my words right now and align it with your promise. &gt;&gt; Sickness is illegal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Depression is illegal. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's an illegal act that Satan puts upon us. Because when people don't know what Christ has already done for them, then Satan comes to try to take advantage. It's like a squatter. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just trying to live in this house. &gt;&gt; But not this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The red ants are here this morning. &gt;&gt; How many of you know what the red ants are? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a legal demolish. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's there established by the government. &gt;&gt; They come and demolish every illegal squatter camp. I say Satan this morning, we're giving you notice. Amen. Satan has been oppressing your mind. Satan has been holding you bound. Amen. But this morning, the red answer here this morning. Amen. To let go of God's people. Amen. To repossess every rightful claim of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Unemployment is illegal. You say, "Why is it illegal?" &gt;&gt; God, if you go, you now remember I'm giving you keys. You need to apply keys. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith is applied by principles. &gt;&gt; If if there's a principle, a law on the earth, say the law of gravity, that whatever you throw up must come down. That's a principle. &gt;&gt; Meaning if that somebody throws it up here in South Africa, it will come down. If somebody throws it up there in the USA, it will come down. If somebody throws it up there in in England, it will come down because it's a principle, a law established on the earth. &gt;&gt; Another kingdom principle is whatsoever you sow, that shall you reap. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a kingdom principle. The reason that you are receiving back lack and Amen. and and all of these bad negative things you haven't sown. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says it is better to give &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; than to receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What have you seown in the season of sewing? &gt;&gt; Remember, if you put nothing in the ground, you can't expect to receive ans. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even the scripture Luke 6:38, what does it say that &gt;&gt; give? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm just expecting you to bless me. Let's go to the scripture, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; What it starts with? &gt;&gt; Give. &gt;&gt; Receive. &gt;&gt; In order for you to receive, what you must do first? &gt;&gt; Give. &gt;&gt; Give. and it shall be given unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying there are seasons in your life where you have to sow. Put Matthew 7:7 there, brother. &gt;&gt; There are seasons you have to sow before you can ask. Ask and it shall be given you. &gt;&gt; Amen. seek. I'm seeking for a wife. I'm seeking for a job. I'm seeking for this. And you shall find. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Seek and you shall find. Which means you need to go on every job website and seek. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then you need to knock. You need to apply. &gt;&gt; You need to apply for the job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to apply the word that you're already healed and it shall be opened unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is the Bible saying here? &gt;&gt; Ask &gt;&gt; at the end part &gt;&gt; that no door shall be closed to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I'm getting at the end part of this is there is no door &gt;&gt; that will be closed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No door shall be closed to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you say, where's the scripture? God put man in the garden to work. &gt;&gt; So according to God's principle, man must work. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said there was no man to till the soil. So God created a garden eastward of Eden and he put man there before he gave him a wife. He said work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's move on. &gt;&gt; So when you're going to God in faith, now this doesn't just apply for the unemployed. It's for those also that have a job, but maybe they need better finances to better take care of their family. &gt;&gt; I thank you, Lord, that you have already given me this according to your word. &gt;&gt; It's illegal for men not to work. So I thank you for for employment. &gt;&gt; Is somebody hearing what I'm saying? Amen. &gt;&gt; And I pray that if you're not writing this down, that you're making a mental note of what I am saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank you, Lord, that I've already received that which you have told me I must do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For me not to work or for me to be in lack or for my family to struggle, Amen. &gt;&gt; is illegal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to prove to you now for you to be in poverty is illegal. &gt;&gt; So we start to say according to your word, unemployment is illegal. So I thank you for employment. According to your word, sickness is illegal. So I thank you for healing &gt;&gt; according to your word. Amen. All of these diseases are illegal. Amen. So our part is to apply every position of the word without considering. So hear what I'm saying? Don't consider the position you're applying for. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do not consider whether you're qualified for the position you're applying for or not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's one testifying. I can also testify for that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do not consider the position you applying for whether you're qualified according to the worldly systems. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, there are certain positions you can't go and practice, right? I'm not saying you must say I'm a doctor now and start treating patients. No, &gt;&gt; I'm not saying they must go and practice law now and all of this. No, I'm saying the position you are going to apply for don't consider whether you're qualified or not. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So according to the worldly qualifications, Joseph was not a qualified to run Portifer's house, let alone Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This boy was pampered by his father. &gt;&gt; He never worked a day in his life. &gt;&gt; The other brothers were working. &gt;&gt; They were taking care of the sheep. But Joseph was pampered by his father. &gt;&gt; He never earned or worked for the coat of many colors. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This was daddy's boy. Daddy's favorite. Hallelujah. He was not qualified to rule part of his house. He did not qualify to be the head of prisoners. He did not qualify to rule Egypt. But God qualified him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God qualified him to run Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Who son are you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am changes everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You need to know that the great I am. &gt;&gt; It's a part of you now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know how we're doing for time, but we need to move on. Amen. So, like we are saying, unemployment is an illegal act. &gt;&gt; Sickness is an illegal act that Satan puts on you because of the fall. Sickness is illegal. Unemployment is illegal. Disease is illegal. Poverty is illegal. Genesis 22:16. Let's see what God told Abraham. &gt;&gt; And said, "By myself." &gt;&gt; Do you know a man's word is good &gt;&gt; as himself? &gt;&gt; But this is no ordinary man swearing. Now, &gt;&gt; this is the one who created all things. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "By myself have I sworn, &gt;&gt; sayeth the Lord, for because thou has done this thing and has not thy son, thine only son." Yeah. &gt;&gt; That in blessing I will bless &gt;&gt; by myself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm swearing a covenant with you Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now remember Abraham chose to sacrifice his son and the Lord created a ram. Right. &gt;&gt; You have chosen to accept God's word in this hour. &gt;&gt; God is a sworn affidavit that he will bless you. You say show me in the scripture. He's saying, Abraham, I have sworn by myself that in blessing I will bless thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In multiplying, I will multiply thee, thy seed, as the stars of the heaven, and the sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice. But you are God's chosen people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you believing that here I am, here I am as the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ, and here's Israel, but God loves Israel more. You are sorely mistaken. That's a lie from the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Between you and Israel, God loves you more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You accepted him. &gt;&gt; You accepted his sacrifice right until now. They reject Jesus. &gt;&gt; So if the Jews, what I'm showing you, &gt;&gt; if they according to a natural covenant can be blessed. &gt;&gt; What about you? &gt;&gt; I say they are not blessed better than you. You are just living beneath your god-given privileges. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice. Now notice what that scripture said. Not only you, Abraham, but your seed after you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then let's get to Galatians 3 and 29 and see if we are in there. And if you be in Christ, all this time we've been reading, we're in Christ in heavenly places. If you be in Christ, then you are Abraham's &gt;&gt; seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. and is according to the promise. &gt;&gt; So if he promised to bless Abraham, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; then he's promised to bless me. &gt;&gt; Abraham's blessings are mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham's blessings are mine. &gt;&gt; Abraham's blessings are mine. &gt;&gt; Abraham's blessings are mine. I told you poverty is illegal. &gt;&gt; You need to tell Satan that. &gt;&gt; You need to confess it with your mouth. Poverty is illegal. I am in Christ and I share the same reward as Abraham. &gt;&gt; And if you promise to bless Abraham, I am part of that blessing and I'm claiming it. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody hear me what I'm saying. Poverty is illegal. [Music] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Somebody write that down. Galatians 3:29. &gt;&gt; And Genesis 22:16, 20, and 17. If God promised to bless Abraham and his seed here in Galatians 23:29, he's saying because I'm in Christ, you are Abraham's seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to go to God and put a claim. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Put a claim on God. &gt;&gt; I refuse to accept that Israel, natural Israel is a blessed far above me. &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I refuse to accept that they are blessed far above me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am Abraham seed. &gt;&gt; Yes. There's no way you can bless him above me. I accepted your sacrifice on the cross. I accepted God's provided way. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You see what he's saying? Satan hasn't got any legal rights at all over a Christian. &gt;&gt; Satan has not got any legal rights at all. &gt;&gt; I told you unemployment, sickness, disease, and all of these things are illegal acts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time a man gets saved, God just writes a whole big bunch of checks and puts your name at the bottom. Are you hearing? God has already written checks out. &gt;&gt; Put your name at the bottom and said, "There you are. Fill them out. Are you scared of it? Fill it out. &gt;&gt; I told you this is practical this morning. What are you desiring? What do you want from the Lord?" &gt;&gt; I'm asking you a question. &gt;&gt; If you don't want to listen to me, neighbor, ask them. Ask him, "What do you want from the Lord?" Come on, brother Caleb. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Are you scared? Fill it out. Whatever things you desire when you pray, believe you receive it. It'll be given to you." And the prophet is quoting Mark 11:23. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Every word of God is a seed that'll bring forth." &gt;&gt; Now, how many of you know where the word of God is coming out of? It's coming out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this time and season, the word of God is in you. &gt;&gt; You are the word made flesh. So, every time you speak, it should be the word of God. Should be the word of God. The word of God is nine even in thy mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua, I will be with you. Amen. Be thou strong. Be thou courageous. Amen. But only keep my word in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Every word of God is a seed that'll bring forth. It'll bring forth what it's purposed for. I see many of you down here raising cotton, apples, peaches, fruits. Here's here's another point now to illustrate. Pay attention to this. When that little apple tree is no bigger than say than right here, every apple that will ever be in that tree is right in them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every apple that will be produced, it's in the seed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I say every job. That's why I told you at the rapture, God knew you what how you'll be raptured. Every promotion, every healing, every deliverance, Amen. is already sent out to you. &gt;&gt; You already have it. &gt;&gt; I say go out and possess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go out and possess it now. Even now, receive your healing. Even now receive what you have asked for right now. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. When God when God dropped down in that room there with he right, the prophet says look at Edith, &gt;&gt; right? Look at Edith. She's been sick in the wheelchair. You can ask for her to be healed. &gt;&gt; He says you're poor. Yeah. Here's the thing that poverty is illegal. The prophet told right you need money even a million rand will be given to you now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She didn't say oh you're not meant to be poor. The prophet didn't say, "Yeah, you're meant to be poor, sister." He said, "Even if you wanted a million rand right now." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It'll be given you. &gt;&gt; Come on. Am I talking to message believers? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of the options available to her &gt;&gt; was not she what she was desiring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying even the options I'm offering you this morning, maybe it's something I haven't touched on, but you are praying and seeking the Lord for this morning. You speak according to the revelation of your faith. &gt;&gt; Auntie Wright said, "I desire, brother Brandon, you are telling me about ET. You are telling me about money. You are telling I desire &gt;&gt; the salvation of my two boys." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything is in that seed. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "Well, where did it come from?" If they're not there, they're in the tree. Not only that, the little tree you stick it in the ground, plant it, it has to grow. It has to draw moisture from the ground. Has to draw more than its a loted portion. You have to give it plenty water. Right? The apples was on the inside at the beginning. It just has to drink. And every man that's born again in Christ, everything you have need of &gt;&gt; and here again now, please, everything you have need of. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have need of a house. I have need of a car. I have need of finances. I have need of this, that, and the other. Everything you have need of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Satan will afflict you. Sure he will. But everything you have need of in your whole life's journey. You see, I'm not making this up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet is telling you, I'm just saying it in a different way sometimes. in your &gt;&gt; whole life's journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything you have need of in your whole life's journey is in you right then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's rephrase that. &gt;&gt; Your job is in you. &gt;&gt; Your healing is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your car, your house, whatever you need is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason you don't have it is because &gt;&gt; Is that what the prophet is saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of in your whole life's journey is in you right then. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But then they tell you your wife is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's in you, you need to speak it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Tyson, you catching this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is it? &gt;&gt; In you. &gt;&gt; It's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to bring what's in you to material. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; When I'm saying it's in you, it's in your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God had thoughts of a world &gt;&gt; with light that was full of form &gt;&gt; that was not void. &gt;&gt; But as long as it remained thoughts, nothing happened. &gt;&gt; God had to speak. &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, wonderful. The prophet says you have to believe his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So everything you have need of is in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know Brew, nothing good ever happens to me. That's the only thing you're telling. &gt;&gt; You know in our family &gt;&gt; it's always you see who's saying that? You saying it. &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of for your whole life's journey is in you. &gt;&gt; You know why I'm telling you that you're a creator. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You were created in the image of God and God is a creator. &gt;&gt; So when God was when God created man, he was looking at an amateur God. &gt;&gt; You can't tell me that you don't believe you're a creator, but you go around and tell everyone random created squirrels &gt;&gt; and you're a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Man is a creator. &gt;&gt; The prophet even says, "Amen. He can even create our own new world." Come on. Am I preaching the message or not? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of for this whole life's journey is in you right then. And we are planted in Christ. You see what I mean? When a born again and baptism of the Holy Spirit has come into your heart, you have everything that you have need for the journey. Now, the only thing you have to do, here's the key. Here's start drinking, drinking, pushing out, drinking, pushing out. I believe here's my analysis of Christ Jesus. He is inexhaustible fountain of life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And every man that's planted in him can drink, drink, and push out and push out every redemptive blessing that God has promised belongs to you. And it's your personal property. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the devil has got any tie to it at all. He hasn't got any legal rights. His legal rights were spoiled at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's a testimony. Sam wanted this building. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen what I'm telling you. You may be renting now, but while you're renting, if you love that house, thank God that he already bought that house. He has already given it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. So Sam wanted this building. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he told the prophet, you know, it's tied up in legal things and I can't get it. This, that, and the other. The prophet went and prayed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet went and prayed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Brother Sam called him. I don't know if it was the next day, but he called him up and he told him, "Brother Brandham, I don't know what happened. &gt;&gt; Suddenly everything worked out, &gt;&gt; and I'm now the owner of this building." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I tell you what you do. &gt;&gt; You ready? &gt;&gt; How many of you are ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is cheaper to rent a car than to buy a car &gt;&gt; because you can rent a car even for one day. You hearing what I'm saying? You hearing what I'm saying? You can rent a car for one day. &gt;&gt; You can even get somebody to help you rent that car, &gt;&gt; but it's harder to go buy a car. Right, brother? So, here what I'm saying. If you got faith enough to believe, go rent the car you want even for one day. You don't have a credit card, go to somebody who got a credit card, say, "Here's the money. Please rent this car for one day and drive in that car." Amen. &gt;&gt; And thank the Lord for already giving you that car. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, who's hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not hearing me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Jeff, what you need to start doing, you know, they have open hour shows. &gt;&gt; You need to start going for this open hour shows. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't know. &gt;&gt; You just make an appointment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And don't go look here in You go look where you want. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You want to stay in an estate, go stay in an estate. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not clear estate now. &gt;&gt; Sorry, sister. She's from clear estate. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you hearing what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's cheaper for you to rent a car. You want a Mercedes, a BMW, go rent it. Go drive in it and say, "Lord, hey, this thing feels nice." If you don't know what I'm talking about, ask brother Willie to give you a lift. It's nice German engineering. &gt;&gt; You drive that thing, you feel good, too. &gt;&gt; Now, you can't lie to me that when you're driving these nice cars, you don't feel good. &gt;&gt; You feel good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These things make you feel good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you've got to have plenty of faith, right? &gt;&gt; So, I'm telling you, if Samadia could ask the prophet and the next day or wherever week it took and the building was released to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. How about you? &gt;&gt; You all heard the testimony of brother Joshua. &gt;&gt; It was one service I said it's 11:23 now. Ask what you want. &gt;&gt; He testified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then there was another service. I said some of you, you don't have to buy your house by mortgage. You can buy it cash. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's only people that are receiving it by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you know they were able to buy their property that way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How? Amen. &gt;&gt; Not on human efforts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God supernaturally supply. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we can't be quoting my God shall supply all my needs. You're saying all your needs. &gt;&gt; But you still have many needs. &gt;&gt; So when is he going to supply in the rapture? &gt;&gt; It must happen now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse paragraph 23 of the next one. There it says, "I found two classes of people listed in my third time around the world. Find two classes of people. One of them is fundamentalist. The other one is Pentecostal." Fundamentals know their their place. They haven't got much faith. The Pentecostals have plenty of faith but don't know who they are. &gt;&gt; It's just like a man that's got money in the bank and don't know how to write a check. And the next man can write a check and don't have money in the bank. If you ever can get them two together, and that's where we should be now &gt;&gt; in heavenly places, we should be that two that's together. &gt;&gt; Amen. If they only realize who you are, you are sons and daughters of God, heirs of the kingdom right now. We are kings. Claim your legal rights. Don't let Satan press anything on you. You're of God. He has no rights to hold it. He says every everyone's always looking at these symptoms. The pastor will pray for them. They go over and say, "Well, I don't seem to be any better." That's not healing. Symptoms is the worst thing. That's one of the greatest scarecrow the devil's got. Symptoms don't have nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stop telling me you're sick and you're this and you're that. You're telling me your symptoms. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm just quoting the prophet here. &gt;&gt; You want to get angry with me? Get angry with the prophet. I still want to be your brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Symptoms don't have nothing to do with it. Is because God said so. If there's anybody ever had a case of symptoms, it was Jonah, &gt;&gt; right? Right? So, we know Jonah had symptoms. Amen. But what he began to do, he started to look and remember what uh what King Solomon said, "If I ever look to your temple." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "If I ever look to your temple, right?" So, let's just get past there. So, next one there. He says, "If you're looking next slide there, just go out down. Talk about symptoms." He was in the whale's belly. Everywhere he looked was whale's belly. Let's move on from there. &gt;&gt; Amen. move on. He says depends. If you're looking at your symptoms, they'll be there. &gt;&gt; If you're looking for symptoms, they'll be there. &gt;&gt; If you look to God's word, symptoms will have to vanish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why did Jonah do that? It's because he knows when Solomon dedicated the temple, he said, "Lord, if their children be in any place and will look towards the holy place to pray, you'll hear from heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if Jonah under those circumstances could believe that God heard Solomon's prayer, how much more ought we when we look once more to thy holy temple where Jesus sits at the right hand of the majesty in heaven, his own body as a sacrifice. Amen. God kept him alive for three days and nights and delivered him to Nineveh. Amen. Hallelujah. He says, "Miss John Doe, I have something here now." He says, "Miss John Doe, I have something here for you." And you say, "What is that?" You look, it's a big box. &gt;&gt; You got a delivery. It's not from take a lot. It's from Satan's lot. Praise the Lord. Amen. He got a big box, big box of rattlesnakes. You say, "I don't want those things." But they're telling you it's your name on it. &gt;&gt; They go to the doctor's office. Your name, your test result. This is &gt;&gt; Come on now, brother. It's your test result. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Accept this test result. &gt;&gt; What you going to do? &gt;&gt; But it's your test result. What you going to do? &gt;&gt; Reject it. &gt;&gt; The test results have come back positive, but you refuse to accept it. &gt;&gt; It says it's yours. They're yours. Somebody sent them to you. Why? You say, "I don't want them." Now, Miss John Doe, here's your name. Somebody sent them to you. They're yours. He will do everything he can make you to take them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He'll do everything to make you believe you're still a sinner. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That you still need to achieve holiness. That you still need to achieve righteousness. That you still need to achieve perfection. &gt;&gt; He's lying to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't sign for nothing the devil bought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brought. Refuse to have it. Don't have it. No, sir. The devil put that affliction. The devil put the disease there. just refuse to see it. No, I won't sign for it. I won't testify for nothing. &gt;&gt; I will testify by his stripes I am healed because he will take it back. Oh, you say yeah but you know snakes are in there too. Your personal name pend on it. You might have marked you for death with cancer with anything else but refuse to see it. No sir, by his stripes I am healed. And testify means to say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is our testimony supposed to be? Our testimony supposed to say say the same thing as God. By his stripes I am healed. By his stripes I am healed. &gt;&gt; You're sleeping. I'm going to make you all stand now. Amen. As I continue. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's get to the next quote there. Amen. After that he says don't be scared. Don't be scared to ask. &gt;&gt; Don't be scared to ask. Ask abundantly. &gt;&gt; You have not because you ask not. &gt;&gt; You ask not because you believe not. Ask a whole lot. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you Bible examples now. Ask a whole lot. &gt;&gt; God will give you a whole lot. &gt;&gt; Who is receiving this word? &gt;&gt; Hey, because I'm coming for Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Long since we called. What's the people we order from to the center? Food. &gt;&gt; Long since we ordered from there. &gt;&gt; Last we had was April. He says, "Ask a whole lot. God will give you a whole lot." &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't hear you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have a whole lot of faith. A fellow told me years now. You You think I was joking when I said this? A fellow was driving riding an old model T4. He said one day he happened to get some good faith. How many of you are getting good faith this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; One day he happened to get some good faith and God gave him a Buick. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I got a Buick faith. I praying for Cadillac faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you had huno faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then you started to believe for Ford faith. &gt;&gt; Some of you started to believe for two years of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm saying there's a whole lot more faith than that. &gt;&gt; You're asking God according to your limitation. &gt;&gt; According to what? Who said you can't own a brand new car? &gt;&gt; Who said you must move around with a skuro? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know who said that? You said that. &gt;&gt; You put the limitation on yourself, not God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Read this thing again. Some of you want this quote. Amen. We'll send it to you. Amen. Praise the Lord. He's riding a old T model. One day he got happened to get some good faith. God gave him a Buick. I got Buick faith. I'm praying for Cadillac faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you want to move in your old model T4, don't be a sulking, grumpy person. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because you didn't have faith. Now you're jealous of everyone else and you're picking on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How about you raise a level of your faith and get yourself out of that situation? &gt;&gt; What you believe, hold on to it. &gt;&gt; Come on now, brother Tyson. What do you believe? &gt;&gt; Amen. What do you believe about your life? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; brother Caleb. What do you believe about your life? What do you believe about your life? &gt;&gt; Sister Victory, what do you believe about your life? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother Noah. What do you believe about your life? &gt;&gt; He says, "Whatever you believe, hold on to it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Kenzo, what do you believe about your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you believe about sickness and disease? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Whatever you believe, you believe you're healed." He says, "Hold on to it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. Keep on what you believe, hold on to it. God will give it. Come on. Are you hearing this? God will give it. &gt;&gt; God will give it. Somebody praise God. God will give it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's got fourth faith. So just stay with the for them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's all right. Let's get a little more faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, ask God for things impossible. You say, "Show me scripture." Ask God for things impossible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ask God that it's so impossible. God will marvel at your faith. &gt;&gt; Here's a scripture. 2 Kings 2:9. Elijah asked Elisha, "Ask what I can do for you before I'm taken from you." And Elisha asked him something he never thought he would ask. He says, "I am ask I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me." And there he says, "Thou has asked a half thing." &gt;&gt; Ask God things you think are impossible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "Nevertheless, Amen. If thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee. But if not, it shall not be so." So it was based on his condition of keeping the word. Right? There again, Matthew 20. And he said unto her, he's asking this woman now, the Lord Jesus, what wilt thou? She said unto him, Grant that my two sons sit, one on thy right hand and the other on their left in thy kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hear what Jesus says? Jesus answered, you know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the same cup that I drink and baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? And they say, we are able. And he said, "You shall indeed drink of my cup and be baptized." You know what Jesus, let me summarize this whole thing. James and John mother came to ask Jesus &gt;&gt; asking a hard thing. &gt;&gt; Once you sit on the throne, Jesus is saying the throne is only reserved for the one that dies, rises again, and overcomes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is where I'm going to throw in now that the boxer goes to fight the battle &gt;&gt; but the wife reaps the reward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he is an overcomer but she's more than an overcomer. &gt;&gt; So Christ died, rose again, seated at the right hand of the father, but me as his wife, I am more than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was James and John. Somebody tell me the sons of thunder. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So ask out things. Praise the Lord. So the greatest power is atomic power. Amen. The greatest power in the world is not the atomic bomb, but a believer in contact with his maker. &gt;&gt; God will do it. He's obligated to do it. If you abide in me, my words abide in you. Then you have God, the word of God. And you believe the word just as you believe God. It is God. It's inseparable. Then if you don't have God's word in you, if you have God's word in you, you have God's life in you. You have God in you. And whatever God's word speaks forth out of you, it'll come to pass just like it was spoke from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. I don't sleep on this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever desires you have, the word of God is in you. &gt;&gt; It's coming out of your mouth. He's saying whatever God speaks through your mouth, he says, "Whatever God's word speaks forth out of you, it'll come to pass just like it was spoke from God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Whatever you ask the father in my name, do you realize what that means?" You realize if we go before God in the name of Jesus, it's just the same as Jesus himself praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You see why I'm saying? We need to approach not come with the servant mentality. The scripture says I don't have time. Hebrews says come before the throne room boldly. You need to come there. Lord I thank you of your son. I thank you Lord that you paid the price and I'm redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the bloodboard of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm a son &gt;&gt; and I thank you that you have given me legal right to ask. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Change the way we approach the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say can I do it? Hear what the prophet is saying. Are we the sons of God? Amen. &gt;&gt; Waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; When God will make himself known, they'll stop sickness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They'll stop cancer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They'll stop diseases. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want you to stop it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want you to stop cancer. &gt;&gt; I want you to stop sickness. I want you to stop disease. How you going to do it? Jesus paid it all. &gt;&gt; Let's get the musicians. &gt;&gt; Jesus paid it all. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on. You ought to have warrior faith right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We ought to storm the gates of the enemy right now. I'm telling you, you lying demon. You lied to me all these years. &gt;&gt; Amen.

You sat like a statue through the whole service. You couldn't have the breakthrough. &gt;&gt; I'm saying now, we're going to break chains. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

We can flex our muscles against problems, circumstances, and trials. Father, every challenge that will come our way, Father, we'll be able to deal with it. Oh God, thank you, Lord, for the word that's been instilled in our hearts this morning, may we walk out of this place, oh God, and Father, utilize, oh God, every scripture, every quotation, every word that's been spoken by the mouth of God this morning, anointed and mixed, oh God, with faith, Father, we can use it, oh God, in our circumstances. Father, as we go this afternoon, oh God, may you go before us and Father, as you bring us back at the appointed time, Father, continue to bless us and may revelation be in attendance. Father, bless your musicians, bless the convenor this morning, Lord, the elders of the church, the office beers, Father. Father, just bring us back and we want to have, Lord, a more glorious time. You said every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before. So, we thank you now. We give you all the glory, the praise and the honor in the mighty name of Jesus.
