[1:10] we're going to speak this morning a
[1:11] little on Father's Day. Amen. If we can
[1:14] put up our slides.
[1:16] Amen. That's our topic. Our father is
[1:19] God.
[1:20] Amen. You know, in the flesh,
[1:22] if somebody's fighting and they say,
[1:24] "I'm going to tell my father about you.
[1:28] I'm going to tell my father about you."
[1:30] Or if their father is in some prominent
[1:32] position,
[1:35] what do they ask him? Do you know who my
[1:36] father is?
[1:39] Now, we are the only people that can say
[1:40] that.
[1:41] Do you know who my father is?
[1:44] Lord,
[1:44] I'm going to tell my father about you.
[1:46] Amen. And Jesus said, I'm not out of
[1:49] scripture. Jesus said, "It's better for
[1:52] that person who offends one of these
[1:54] little ones."
[1:55] Amen.
[1:55] That a millstone was put around his head
[1:58] and thrown into the deepest ocean
[2:00] than for them to offend one of my little
[2:02] ones.
[2:03] God takes offense when people harm his
[2:05] children.
[2:06] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:08] Blessed be his name. So, our father is
[2:10] God. Amen. Just got a little greeting, a
[2:12] little scripture. Amen. Wishing their
[2:14] fathers happy father's day. It says, "Be
[2:16] strong and of a good courage. Be not
[2:19] afraid, neither be thou dismayed.
[2:22] For the Lord thy God is with thee,
[2:25] whethersoever thou goest.
[2:27] Amen.
[2:28] Amen.
[2:29] Hallelujah. Let's just get to our
[2:31] scripture, then we can be seated.
[2:32] Hebrews 12 and verse 7. Amen.
[2:37] Hebrews 12 and verse 7.
[2:48] If you endure chastening, God dealeth
[2:51] with you as with sons.
[2:54] Amen.
[2:55] Amen.
[2:55] Any father must chasen his son,
[2:57] right?
[2:58] Must discipline,
[3:00] give instruction. God dealeth with you
[3:03] as sons. For what son is he whom the
[3:06] father chasteneth? That's discipline
[3:08] not. Furthermore, this is verse 9. Now
[3:12] we have had fathers of our flesh which
[3:14] corrected us and we gave them reverence.
[3:17] Shall we not much rather be in
[3:20] subjection unto the father of spirits
[3:22] and live?
[3:23] Amen.
[3:24] Amen. Then 1 Corinthians chapter 4:14
[3:29] the apostle Paul writing here I write
[3:32] not these things to shame you but as my
[3:35] beloved sons I warn you. So remember the
[3:38] apostle Paul is correcting the ch the
[3:40] Corinthian church and he's saying I do
[3:42] this take this correction as me being
[3:45] your father you are my beloved sons for
[3:48] though you have 10,000 instructors in
[3:50] Christ
[3:52] you have yet have ye not many fathers
[3:57] now we got many instructors in the
[3:58] message as well
[4:00] but very few father sons
[4:02] Amen
[4:03] disciple sons
[4:05] raise up sons He says, "You have 10,000
[4:09] instructors in Christ, yet have he not
[4:12] many fathers, for in Christ Jesus, I
[4:16] have begotten you through the gospel."
[4:18] Amen.
[4:19] Wherefore I beseech you, be he followers
[4:22] of me. Amen. You may be seated. The Lord
[4:24] had blessings through the reading of his
[4:26] word. Amen. While you're being seated, I
[4:28] just want to thank the Lord. Father, I
[4:30] thank you, Lord, for your word that's
[4:31] come forth. Lord, just reading your
[4:33] scripture, Father, we realize, oh God,
[4:35] our connection with you and our
[4:37] partnership with you, Father, our
[4:39] inheritance with you. I pray, Lord, that
[4:41] you will bless your word and Lord, come
[4:42] and anoint it now even as we minister to
[4:44] the people of God. I pray, Lord, they'll
[4:46] be attentive and I pray, Lord Jesus,
[4:48] they will receive the word. May it fall
[4:49] on good ground. I ask in Jesus name.
[4:51] Amen.
[4:52] Amen.
[4:53] Amen. Brother Romesh is away in
[4:54] Johannesburg with his daughter. May the
[4:56] Lord bless him and keep him. So, you
[4:58] know what that means? I am missing a
[5:00] part of my amen corner here. So,
[5:02] somebody's gonna have to make up.
[5:04] Amen. Brother Romesh is someone whether
[5:06] it's hot or cold, whether he's sick or
[5:07] not, he says, "Amen."
[5:10] Amen. Hallelujah. So, brother Caleb,
[5:12] you're going to take his place
[5:14] when you're not projecting. Amen. God
[5:16] bless you. Amen. Let's turn quickly to
[5:18] John 1 and verse 10. Now if God is our
[5:21] father, all powerful, all knowing,
[5:24] and he created the heavens and the
[5:26] earth,
[5:28] Amen. created the heavens and the earth.
[5:30] But the power of his spoken word, he
[5:33] said, "Let there be an creation came
[5:35] about."
[5:35] Amen.
[5:36] Amen.
[5:37] Amen.
[5:39] Do you suppose anyone having a son won't
[5:41] have the same attributes?
[5:44] A dog, if he has an offspring, will be a
[5:46] dog and have the attributes of a dog.
[5:49] I'm Same with the monkey.
[5:51] So God said, "Let us make man in our
[5:53] image
[5:55] after our likeness and let him have
[5:58] dominion."
[6:00] Primary purpose of man to have dominion.
[6:03] Amen.
[6:05] And we will not settle, we will not rest
[6:08] till we come into full dominion.
[6:11] And let me tell you, the Holy Spirit
[6:12] will not rest either until you come back
[6:15] to full dominion.
[6:16] Hallelujah.
[6:17] Amen.
[6:17] Amen. Hallelujah.
[6:19] Amen.
[6:19] Cuz that's our ought to be conditioned.
[6:22] So John 1:10 says he was in the world
[6:26] and the world was made by him. Now who
[6:28] was in the world?
[6:29] Was it our Lord Jesus Christ?
[6:31] And the Bible is saying the world was
[6:33] made by him.
[6:35] Amen.
[6:36] And the world knew him not. He came unto
[6:39] his own and his own received him not.
[6:42] But as many as received him, thank the
[6:44] Lord we have received him. Amen.
[6:46] To them gave he power.
[6:49] Amen.
[6:50] To become sons of God.
[6:52] Amen.
[6:52] You see, he's not going to leave us
[6:54] disempowered.
[6:55] This is not a God who watch his children
[6:57] in poverty. He doesn't leave us in
[6:59] poverty. Neither does he leave us
[7:01] powerless.
[7:02] We leave ourselves in those conditions.
[7:04] But God has already made a way. Amen.
[7:07] He has given us power. Amen. To become
[7:11] the sons of God. Even to them that
[7:13] believe on his name.
[7:15] So that's to you and I who believe on
[7:17] his name. We have power to come back to
[7:19] sunship.
[7:20] Yes.
[7:21] Full authority.
[7:23] Amen. Now God's design for fatherhood
[7:26] was to express himself and also reveal
[7:29] himself to the human race through a
[7:31] human body of Jesus Christ. Now
[7:33] interesting scripture in Genesis 2:24.
[7:38] God had created Adam and Eve. And Adam,
[7:42] the Lord takes a rib out of his side and
[7:45] Adam sees Eve there and he says, "This
[7:48] is bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh."
[7:51] Amen.
[7:51] But the very next verse, he's going to
[7:53] reveal God's plan for mankind because
[7:55] they didn't have any children.
[7:57] But look at what God immediately says
[7:59] after
[8:01] Adam says, "This is born of my bone."
[8:03] The very next verse says, "Therefore
[8:04] shall a man leave his father." But there
[8:06] was no fathers there yet.
[8:08] Adam was not yet a father.
[8:11] But that's in the back part of God's
[8:13] mind.
[8:14] And he's telling us a man shall leave
[8:16] his father.
[8:18] Amen. So it's showing you that God
[8:20] always had fatherhood in his mind.
[8:22] Amen. And in Genesis 3:15,
[8:27] so the seed of God is very important.
[8:30] Genesis 3:15 says, "I will put energy
[8:32] between thee and the woman, and between
[8:34] thy seed and her seed, and it shall
[8:38] bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise
[8:40] his heel."
[8:41] So, we see God is further revealing his
[8:44] plan. There's going to come a seed on
[8:45] the earth.
[8:47] There's going to be a fight, a struggle.
[8:50] Amen. So, God has always been looking
[8:52] after his seed and protecting his royal
[8:54] seed. Amen.
[8:55] Remember, they tried to kill the seed in
[8:58] Abel. Yes.
[9:01] Amen.
[9:03] Cain killed Abel.
[9:04] Right.
[9:06] Very first murder committed in the
[9:08] Garden of Eden. But God raised up Sith.
[9:11] A type of the resurrection. Amen.
[9:13] Hallelujah. God raised up Sith.
[9:15] Amen.
[9:16] Amen. So God's purpose will not be
[9:18] defeated. So here in Genesis 17:7,
[9:21] he finds a man by the name of Abraham.
[9:23] He finds a man he can have confidence
[9:25] in.
[9:26] Yes. And listen to what he says. I will
[9:29] establish my covenant between me and
[9:31] thee, and thy seed after thee in their
[9:34] generations for an everlasting covenant
[9:37] to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed
[9:40] after thee.
[9:41] Amen. Amen.
[9:42] Amen.
[9:44] So God is interested in the seed.
[9:46] God is interested in the bloodline.
[9:49] Amen. Hallelujah. Genesis 18:1 17. Look
[9:53] at what the God the Lord is telling now
[9:55] after he come down and he revealed
[9:57] himself to Abraham and Sarah and Abraham
[10:00] bargains with him. Now he says, "Shall I
[10:03] a from Abraham the thing which I do
[10:07] seeing Abraham shall surely become a
[10:09] great and mighty nation?" This is
[10:11] prophecy.
[10:12] Amen.
[10:12] Abraham doesn't have seed yet.
[10:14] Hallelujah.
[10:15] God is telling him, "You are going to be
[10:16] a great and mighty nation."
[10:18] Amen.
[10:19] God is telling you, you're going to be
[10:20] an invincible army.
[10:22] Hallelujah. God is saying, "You're going
[10:24] to be the super church, a super race."
[10:26] Amen. God already sees your end from
[10:29] your beginning.
[10:30] Amen.
[10:30] Amen. He's going to be a great and
[10:33] mighty nation. And all the nations of
[10:35] the earth shall be blessed in him.
[10:37] Amen.
[10:38] Amen.
[10:38] Are we some of the nations of the earth?
[10:41] We are blessed through royal Abraham.
[10:43] Blessed because of the blessings of
[10:45] Abraham. Amen. Abraham's blessings are
[10:48] mine. Because of Jesus Christ, I'm
[10:51] blessed coming in. I'm blessed going
[10:53] out. Abraham's blessings are mine.
[10:56] Amen. Abraham was not a beggar. Amen.
[10:58] Abraham did not borrow. Even when he
[11:00] bought Sarah's tomb, he would not take
[11:02] it for nothing. But he bought the tomb.
[11:05] Abraham's people are rich people, a
[11:08] prosperous people.
[11:09] Amen.
[11:10] Amen. If there's something you could
[11:11] disconnecting you from the blessing, I
[11:13] ask you to confess that before the Lord
[11:16] and reconnect back to the blessing.
[11:18] Reconnect back to THE FOUNTAIN.
[11:20] RECONNECT BACK TO THE FLOW. AMEN.
[11:22] AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[11:24] AMEN.
[11:25] NOW, some of you say, "Oh, but I can't
[11:27] take that literally. I love to be poor."
[11:28] Shame on you.
[11:31] Come on now. Take God's word literally.
[11:35] Abraham wasn't blessed spiritually only.
[11:40] Amen. For I know him. Watch now.
[11:43] Fatherhood. Watch how God already sees
[11:46] in Abraham. I know him that he will
[11:48] command his children and his household
[11:50] after him.
[11:52] Amen.
[11:52] Amen. This is where headship is restored
[11:54] back in the church again.
[11:56] Hallelujah.
[11:56] Christ is the head of the church. The
[11:58] husband the head of every home.
[11:59] Amen.
[12:00] Amen. Hallelujah. Husbands, don't let
[12:03] the wives make you the tail at home.
[12:06] You have a God-given position.
[12:08] You're the head of that home.
[12:10] When I say head of that home, you're the
[12:11] spiritual leader of that home. Amen.
[12:13] Don't leave the house in poverty
[12:15] spiritually.
[12:17] Don't leave the house spiritually not
[12:19] disciplined.
[12:20] It's your responsibility to lead the
[12:22] home.
[12:23] It's your responsibility. Amen. To see
[12:25] to the spiritual welfare of the home.
[12:28] Amen. Maybe materially you're
[12:30] prospering. Amen. But spiritually the
[12:32] home is dead.
[12:33] Then you are out of God's order. You are
[12:35] out of God's plan. God placed you at the
[12:37] head of the home to lead the home.
[12:39] Amen.
[12:40] Amen.
[12:43] If your wife is more spiritual than you,
[12:45] then something is wrong.
[12:47] That's not God's program.
[12:49] The wife was not made to be the
[12:50] spiritual head of a man.
[12:52] The wife should not be begging you and
[12:53] forcing you to come to church and serve
[12:55] the Lord. You are the head of the home.
[12:57] As the head of the home, you are the
[12:58] priest of the home. Amen.
[13:00] Amen. The reason we have so many people
[13:03] that are in chaos, transgender,
[13:05] homosexual, gays, Amen. people
[13:07] committing suicide, and you'll find,
[13:09] Amen. even women running around loosely.
[13:11] Amen. It's because they didn't have a
[13:13] strong father figure.
[13:15] Amen.
[13:16] The image was distorted.
[13:18] Ask yourself, how do you want to raise
[13:19] your home?
[13:21] Ask yourself, how do you want your son
[13:22] to see you?
[13:23] Don't you want your son, your daughter,
[13:25] to see you as a man of God?
[13:27] As a man who stands firm and resolute on
[13:29] the word of God.
[13:31] Amen. He will command his children and
[13:34] his household after him. Can God say
[13:36] that about you?
[13:37] Amen.
[13:38] I know my son. He will command his
[13:40] household after me. Amen.
[13:42] They shall keep the way of the Lord to
[13:44] do justice and judgment that the Lord
[13:47] may bring upon Abraham
[13:49] that which he had spoken of him.
[13:52] [cough and clears throat]
[13:53] I wish I had water here. Amen. That the
[13:56] Lord may bring upon Abraham tap water to
[14:00] his fine. You know, David one time asked
[14:02] for a drink
[14:05] and the the his soldiers got really mad
[14:08] and they went and they killed some
[14:09] people and they went to get fresh water.
[14:13] Amen. You must watch how it's going to
[14:15] come now with the power of the spoken
[14:16] word.
[14:18] [laughter]
[14:19] Amen.
[14:21] And the Lord said, "Because the cry of
[14:23] Sodom and Gomorrah is great, because
[14:26] their sin is very grievious, I will go
[14:28] down and see whether they have done
[14:29] alltogether according to the cry of it
[14:31] which has come up unto me. And if not, I
[14:34] will know it." Why did I read that? I
[14:36] could have stopped short of that.
[14:37] Amen. Thank you, brother.
[14:44] Amen.
[14:45] Why did I read that? The world is
[14:48] celebrating a time again
[14:50] called Pride Month.
[14:51] That's right.
[14:52] I was hearing, Amen. somebody, and these
[14:54] are not even Christian people, they're
[14:56] saying, "You know what? When we
[14:57] celebrate someone who really did
[14:58] something good for mankind, we only
[15:00] celebrate one day,
[15:02] Nelson Mandela Day, or maybe they'll
[15:05] have a George Washington day or a
[15:07] Abraham Lincoln day." But here they want
[15:10] a whole month
[15:11] to celebrate their sin.
[15:14] M
[15:16] now let me tell you the percentage of
[15:18] them are very minor compared to the
[15:21] normal people.
[15:22] Yeah.
[15:23] But look how they've exalted this thing
[15:26] and corporates are bowing down to it.
[15:28] Corporate companies
[15:30] are bowing down to it
[15:32] and promoting it and saying pride
[15:35] pride month. You know what they're
[15:37] doing? They're going back to Genesis and
[15:39] distorting God's family.
[15:41] The purpose God had in his mind for
[15:43] family. Yeah,
[15:44] they are distorting it. But not one of
[15:46] them can reproduce and bring forth
[15:47] another child.
[15:49] So what gives them the right to tell us
[15:51] how to raise our children? Who can bring
[15:53] forth children?
[15:54] They can't bring forth children, but
[15:56] they want to tell us how to raise our
[15:57] children. [clears throat]
[15:59] But the world has gone insane and
[16:00] they're listening to them,
[16:01] right?
[16:02] Why did I read that? God's ready to
[16:04] burn.
[16:05] God's got line match there.
[16:10] He's ready to strike. Right.
[16:13] You know he's going to strike. You know
[16:15] how God said he's going to strike.
[16:17] Man, there's up atomic warfare. That's
[16:19] right.
[16:20] This, that, the other. They're going to
[16:22] launch it one of these days.
[16:24] Amen. But it's coming. Judgment is
[16:26] coming.
[16:26] Amen.
[16:27] Amen. Hallelujah.
[16:29] If you go to slide three there, you'll
[16:31] hear you prophet says here. They spread
[16:34] their poison in every effort to destroy
[16:36] the seed of God. Even as Cain killed
[16:38] Abel. He's talking about the church
[16:41] world, how they spread their poison into
[16:43] the message.
[16:44] They spread their poison into the
[16:46] gospel, hoping to kill the seed of God,
[16:49] even as Cain killed Abel.
[16:52] Amen. They tried to kill the lineage OF
[16:54] GOD. THEY TRIED TO KILL THE SEED of God.
[16:56] Didn't they try to kill Moses?
[16:59] Was that the first Exodus?
[17:02] Didn't they try to kill Jesus?
[17:04] Was that the second exodus? Amen.
[17:06] Now, if there was a mass killing of
[17:07] babies in the first Exodus and second
[17:09] exodus, why is there another mass
[17:11] killing of babies called abortion in the
[17:14] third exodus?
[17:14] Amen.
[17:15] They are trying to get through the
[17:16] scene.
[17:17] But Amen. NO AMOUNT, AMEN. OF ABORTION
[17:20] LAWS can stop you from coming forth.
[17:23] Amen.
[17:23] Amen. EVEN IF YOUR MOTHER TRIED
[17:25] ABORTION, YOU STILL CAME FORTH.
[17:27] God protected his seed.
[17:29] Amen.
[17:31] Amen.
[17:32] Here the prophet will detail it here in
[17:34] slide four. I thought I had you when I
[17:36] killed Abel. When I threw you in the
[17:37] lion's den. I THOUGHT I GOT YOU.
[17:41] When I put the Hebrew children in the
[17:42] FIERY FURNACE. I THOUGHT I had you when
[17:44] I killed the prophets.
[17:47] When I beheaded John the Baptist,
[17:50] I thought I had you. He thought he had
[17:52] killed the seed.
[17:54] But Satan,
[17:57] his minute mind,
[17:59] his plan was cut short. Amen.
[18:02] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's read John 3:16.
[18:05] Amen. All the young people now John
[18:06] 3:16.
[18:08] Amen. Everybody knows John 3:16.
[18:11] Let's see father's love for us and how
[18:12] he came. Amen.
[18:15] Our father is God.
[18:16] Amen.
[18:17] Amen.
[18:20] Hallelujah.
[18:21] Thank you, Lord.
[18:22] Young people, you may not understand the
[18:23] concept right now. You may be thinking,
[18:25] "Hey, my father is there."
[18:26] What are you talking about?
[18:29] You have an earthly father,
[18:31] but we have a spiritual father. Amen.
[18:34] Amen. And he's God Almighty.
[18:36] For God so loved the world.
[18:38] Amen.
[18:39] That he gave his only begotten son.
[18:43] That whosoever believeth in him should
[18:45] not perish.
[18:47] There's the promise right there. I thank
[18:49] you, Lord. I shall never perish.
[18:51] Amen.
[18:53] But have everlasting life.
[18:56] Amen.
[18:56] Amen. To believe on the Lord Jesus
[18:58] Christ is life everlasting. Yes.
[19:00] For God sent not his son into the world
[19:02] to condemn the world, but that through
[19:05] but that the world through him might be
[19:07] saved.
[19:08] Amen.
[19:09] He that believeth on him is not
[19:11] condemned, but he that believeth not is
[19:13] condemned. So you see, man brings
[19:15] condemnation upon himself.
[19:17] Right?
[19:18] God has given man a choice.
[19:21] I have pardoned the entire world if you
[19:23] believe on me.
[19:24] Amen.
[19:25] Amen.
[19:26] I have paid the price for the entire
[19:28] world if you believe on me. Now the
[19:30] choice is back to you. Free moral agency
[19:33] to the ones that believe gets eternal
[19:35] life. To the ones that reject is
[19:37] condemned.
[19:38] Is the Bible clear.
[19:40] Amen.
[19:41] So he paid the price. Amen. SO THAT THE
[19:44] ENTIRE WORLD CAN go free.
[19:46] But the choice is in man's hand.
[19:48] He that believeth not is condemned
[19:50] already because he hath not believed in
[19:52] the name of the only begotten son of
[19:54] God.
[19:56] 2 Corinthians 6 and verse 18. I want to
[19:58] lay these scriptures as a form of
[20:00] teaching and I want to put these
[20:02] scriptures there so that we can rest
[20:04] assured and see who we are.
[20:06] You know the world is struggling with
[20:07] identity.
[20:09] Not only these transgender people and
[20:10] these gays and lesbians,
[20:12] man himself is struggling for identity.
[20:14] They want to know their purpose. Is
[20:16] there a God? That's why you get these
[20:18] atheists questioning. Is there a God?
[20:21] Where did I come from? What is my
[20:22] purpose here on the earth? And where am
[20:24] I going to?
[20:25] Three fundamental questions every man
[20:27] must answer.
[20:29] Where did I come from?
[20:32] Amen. We came from God.
[20:34] What is my purpose here on the earth? To
[20:36] manifest him on the earth.
[20:38] Amen.
[20:38] Where am I going to? Amen. We are going
[20:41] to a new Jerusalem.
[20:43] We can answer those three questions.
[20:45] Amen.
[20:45] But most men can't answer that question.
[20:48] They don't know where they came from.
[20:49] Some believe they evolved from apes.
[20:53] Yeah. Some believe they evolved.
[20:56] Some Some don't know where they are
[20:58] going to. Some believe that when they
[20:59] die, they're going to come back as a
[21:01] rat,
[21:01] as a cockroach.
[21:04] That's the belief.
[21:06] They don't know the answer to these
[21:08] questions. And most of them don't know
[21:10] what their purpose is here on earth.
[21:11] Because if you don't know where you came
[21:13] from, you don't know where you're going,
[21:14] then your purpose here is meaningless.
[21:16] You feel it's just for 70 years, 80
[21:18] years, and then that's it. M
[21:20] close your eyes and you're forgotten.
[21:23] But the gospel presents the truth to us.
[21:25] Amen. Yes.
[21:28] 2 Corinthians 6:18 says that I will be a
[21:32] father unto you. You shall be my sons
[21:34] and daughters, sayeth the Lord Almighty.
[21:37] Amen.
[21:38] Amen. So you are sons and daughters of
[21:40] the most high God.
[21:41] Hallelujah.
[21:42] And I'm emphasizing this again. God
[21:44] cannot have powerless people.
[21:46] Amen.
[21:47] God cannot have powerless sons and
[21:48] daughters. Amen.
[21:49] Not my God. HE'S TOO POWERFUL TO
[21:51] REPRODUCE HIMSELF. A POWERLESS CREATURE.
[21:56] RIGHT.
[21:57] Galatians 3 and 26.
[22:00] See how we become children of God. Now,
[22:02] very small scriptures, very oneliners,
[22:05] but it's powerful. Galatians 3:26 says,
[22:09] "For here are all the children of God by
[22:12] faith in Christ Jesus."
[22:14] Amen. Amen.
[22:16] How are you children of God?
[22:19] Say it
[22:20] throughus.
[22:22] Through faith.
[22:24] Through faith in him. You must believe.
[22:27] Amen. You must believe in Christ Jesus.
[22:29] Then you are children of God.
[22:31] Here now we answer the first question
[22:34] where we came from. Ephesians 1:5.
[22:39] Having predestinated.
[22:42] Your destiny is predetermined.
[22:43] Amen.
[22:44] Predestined us.
[22:46] Yes. predestinated us unto the adoption
[22:48] of children by Jesus Christ to himself.
[22:52] Amen.
[22:52] According to the good pleasure of his
[22:54] will. Now pay attention to the scripture
[22:56] because predestination only speaks about
[22:58] sunship.
[22:59] Amen. Amen. Yes.
[23:02] Predestination doesn't speak about you
[23:05] in seed form.
[23:07] Predestination doesn't speak to you
[23:09] about you being in bride form.
[23:13] Predestination doesn't speak to you
[23:14] about you being the wife of the Lord
[23:16] Jesus Christ. What does predestination
[23:19] speak about?
[23:23] You don't believe me? Produce another
[23:25] scripture in the Bible that tells me you
[23:27] are predestinated to be the wife of the
[23:28] Lord Jesus Christ. Produce another
[23:31] scripture that tells me any other thing.
[23:34] Predestination talks about you being
[23:37] adopted children.
[23:38] Amen.
[23:39] Sons and daughters. Amen.
[23:41] Amen. Hallelujah.
[23:43] Every other thing is in type in type in
[23:45] type.
[23:47] We are the wife of the Lord Jesus
[23:48] Christ. Why? To reproduce his life to
[23:51] make us sons and daughters of God.
[23:53] That's the finished product.
[23:55] Christ will fully adopt us at the
[23:57] resurrection.
[23:58] Amen.
[23:59] Of the saints and our TRANSLATION OF THE
[24:01] BODIES. AMEN. Because we cannot be fully
[24:03] ADOPTED IN THESE BODIES. THIS BODY NEEDS
[24:06] TO CHANGE. THE FINAL PROCESS OF ADOPTION
[24:08] IS THE BODY CHANGE.
[24:10] AMEN. THEN WE'LL BE IN OUR FULL
[24:12] AUTHORITY. WE'LL BE IN OUR FULL POWER.
[24:15] AMEN.
[24:16] AMEN. Right now, we are in that amateur
[24:18] stage coming. Amen. Speaking the word.
[24:20] Amen. Taking for dominion, taking
[24:22] authority over Satan's kingdom.
[24:26] Tearing down principalities.
[24:28] Amen.
[24:29] Amen. How can one have children if he
[24:31] doesn't have a wife?
[24:35] So God had a bride
[24:38] through seven church ages
[24:40] and that wife must reproduce his own
[24:43] life.
[24:44] Amen.
[24:45] That life pre-produced makes you a son
[24:47] and daughter of God.
[24:49] Amen. There it is. There predestinated
[24:52] us unto the adoption of children by
[24:54] Jesus Christ to himself.
[24:57] 1 John 3 and1.
[24:59] Don't get tired of these scriptures now.
[25:01] Amen. I know you don't read your Bible
[25:02] at home, so I'm reading it for you. Now,
[25:05] when they asked you when last you read
[25:07] your Bible, you can say today.
[25:10] John 3:1. Behold, what manner of love
[25:14] the father had bestowed upon us.
[25:16] Amen.
[25:17] That we should be called the sons of
[25:19] God.
[25:20] Yes.
[25:21] Therefore, the world knoweth us not
[25:23] because it knew him not.
[25:25] So, don't seek framing the world. The
[25:28] world reject if the world is accepting
[25:30] you something is wrong.
[25:32] Then you are not like your father.
[25:34] You are not like Jesus.
[25:36] If the world rejected Jesus because of
[25:38] what he stood for, they will reject you
[25:40] because of what you stand for.
[25:43] Yes.
[25:45] Beloved, now are we the sons of God?
[25:48] Is it tomorrow?
[25:50] Amen.
[25:51] Now,
[25:52] are we the sons of God? It does not
[25:55] appear what we shall be, but we know
[25:57] when he shall appear, we shall be like
[26:00] him, for we shall see him as he is.
[26:02] Amen.
[26:04] One more scripture there to emphasize
[26:05] this point. Ro, Revelation 21:7.
[26:16] He that overcometh shall inherit all
[26:19] things. This is now not to the seven
[26:21] church ages.
[26:22] That is found in you know which book.
[26:23] Revelation 3. To him that overcome. To
[26:26] him that overcome. To him that overcome.
[26:28] This is now the end. Revelation 21.
[26:31] He that overcome shall inherit all
[26:33] things.
[26:34] Amen.
[26:34] How many if you can already see yourself
[26:36] there?
[26:37] How many if you can already see yourself
[26:38] as an inheritor?
[26:40] How many if you can see yourself?
[26:41] ENVISION IT. AMEN. AMEN.
[26:44] I will be his God and he shall be my
[26:48] wait
[26:51] is not people.
[26:54] He shall be my what?
[26:56] There are many peoples.
[26:58] But there's something about a son.
[27:01] There's something about the bloodline.
[27:03] There's something about that seed. Amen.
[27:08] Why? What does son speak about?
[27:12] inheritance.
[27:13] Amen.
[27:14] Amen.
[27:15] I have an inheritance.
[27:17] Amen.
[27:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Romans 8:12.
[27:22] Amen.
[27:24] Now, I'm going to bring it even further
[27:26] because how many of you
[27:29] when you look at the life of Jesus and
[27:32] you see him there come forth and he
[27:34] turns water into wine
[27:37] and he speaks to the storm and he speaks
[27:40] to the wind
[27:42] and he raises the dead and he cleanses
[27:45] the lepers and a man who has no eyeballs
[27:48] he eyeballs he takes mud and he puts it
[27:50] there and he creates eyeballs for
[27:53] Amen.
[27:54] And a man who's blind, Bartameus,
[27:57] he gives him back his sight.
[27:59] Amen.
[28:00] All manner of sicknesses and diseases,
[28:02] Jesus was healing.
[28:03] Thank you, Lord.
[28:04] How many of you know you have the same
[28:06] power?
[28:07] Amen.
[28:08] Come on now. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow.
[28:11] Glory.
[28:11] How many of you know you are? WHEN YOU
[28:13] LOOK AT THAT,
[28:14] you must say that's me.
[28:17] Because didn't it say she is him?
[28:20] What is it? Now we are reproducing the
[28:22] feminine part of him.
[28:24] Amen.
[28:24] There was a mystery in Christ. Like
[28:26] there was a mystery in Adam.
[28:28] God took the mystery out of Adam.
[28:30] And put Eve on display.
[28:33] Now in the last time, Jesus Christ has a
[28:35] bride. He has taken his bride from his
[28:37] side at Calvary and he's put her on
[28:40] display.
[28:40] G.
[28:41] But every time you see these things,
[28:43] yes, marvel at what Jesus did, but say
[28:46] that's my potential.
[28:47] Amen.
[28:48] Amen.
[28:49] Come on now. Glory.
[28:50] I know this is hard for you, some of you
[28:52] to believe this, but we are going into
[28:53] another level.
[28:55] Amen.
[28:55] We are progressing in Christ.
[28:58] Amen.
[29:00] What we see our husband do, what we see
[29:02] him do in masculine form, he is doing in
[29:05] feminine form.
[29:06] You say, "Oh, but I don't see these
[29:08] things." Let me tell you something.
[29:10] All God's children pray for the sick
[29:13] and they are healed.
[29:15] You don't believe me. You say, "Oh, but
[29:17] Genesis, Abraham, Abraham had to pray
[29:20] for the sick."
[29:21] If you go and read about Aimilec when he
[29:24] didn't want, see, some of you are
[29:25] already frowning and you're thinking, "I
[29:26] never
[29:32] When Amalecch took his wife,
[29:35] God struck him
[29:37] with a disease
[29:38] and he told him, "Tell my prophet to
[29:40] pray for you."
[29:41] Amen.
[29:41] Right. Amen.
[29:42] If you go and find it in the Bible, I'll
[29:44] give you some homework. could read there
[29:45] in Genesis.
[29:47] The Bible says, "And when Abraham laid
[29:48] hands on him and prayed for him, God
[29:50] healed him."
[29:52] So these signs shall follow them that
[29:54] believe
[29:55] all the way from Abraham's time
[29:57] till now.
[29:58] You know why people uh lay hands on the
[30:00] sick and they don't recover?
[30:03] What do you think the key is it?
[30:05] Believe.
[30:07] They're doing it out of form, out of
[30:09] ritual,
[30:10] but they don't believe.
[30:12] These signs shall follow them that
[30:13] believe. Amen.
[30:14] This is an attribute of a son and
[30:16] daughter of God.
[30:18] Amen.
[30:18] Your husband is sick. You go there and
[30:20] you lay hands on him.
[30:22] Amen.
[30:22] Your wife is sick. Go lay hands on her.
[30:25] Your daughter is sick. Son is sick. Stop
[30:27] running and say, "Are you where's my
[30:29] medical card?"
[30:36] Hey, therefore, brethren, we are debtors
[30:39] not to the flesh to live after the
[30:41] flesh.
[30:43] What is a debtor?
[30:46] You owe somebody something.
[30:48] But he's saying we don't owe it after
[30:50] the flesh,
[30:51] right?
[30:51] To live after the flesh. For if you live
[30:54] after the flesh, you shall die. But if
[30:56] you through the spirit do mortify the
[30:58] deeds of the body, you shall live.
[31:00] Amen.
[31:01] Now watch. For as many as led by the
[31:03] spirit of God,
[31:05] they are the sons of God.
[31:07] Amen.
[31:08] So you can't claim to be a son of God
[31:10] and you're not led by the spirit of God.
[31:13] The sons of God are led by the spirit of
[31:14] God. For you have not received the
[31:17] spirit of bondage again to fear. Here's
[31:19] Ephesians 1:15 coming into light now.
[31:21] But you have received the spirit of
[31:23] adoption.
[31:24] Amen.
[31:26] Whereby we cry aba father.
[31:28] Glory.
[31:28] Amen. The spirit itself bearing witness
[31:31] with our spirit.
[31:32] Amen.
[31:32] Didn't he say I'll give you a new spirit
[31:35] and then I'll put my spirit within you.
[31:37] Amen. Amen.
[31:38] So he's saying the the Holy Spirit is
[31:39] bearing witness with our spirit that we
[31:42] are what?
[31:43] The children of God.
[31:47] And if children then what?
[31:51] Amen.
[31:52] We have an inheritance.
[31:55] God,
[31:57] God has something to give to us.
[32:00] Amen.
[32:01] And some of you couldn't swallow what I
[32:04] was saying about Jesus. them.
[32:06] You are joint hairs with who?
[32:11] Joint hairs with Christ.
[32:14] You know what joints is?
[32:16] It doesn't mean that Jesus gets 75 and
[32:18] you get 25.
[32:22] What is joint tears? Ah, some of you
[32:25] don't believe this. Now
[32:26] ah
[32:30] some of you want
[32:33] only a 5%. Some of you saying I only
[32:36] give 10% so I only I'm satisfied with
[32:38] 10% blessing.
[32:41] Do you know the scripture on tithing
[32:43] doesn't say how much the Lord is going
[32:44] to give you back.
[32:47] He only says I'll do it pressed down,
[32:50] shaken together, and running over.
[32:54] Thank you, Lord.
[32:56] The the misers are the banks, not God.
[33:01] What's the highest interest rate you can
[33:02] earn? Caleb, you'll know.
[33:05] 10. You see, they base it off tithing.
[33:11] But not God.
[33:13] God says, "I'll press down.
[33:16] If I tell you to pack a suitcase full of
[33:18] money, press it down
[33:20] so you can fill more.
[33:22] Press down. shaken together and running
[33:26] over.
[33:28] Amen.
[33:30] Joint hairs with Christ.
[33:32] 50/50 partnership.
[33:34] Hallelujah.
[33:37] Amen.
[33:37] Isn't that what it is in a marriage?
[33:40] 50/50 partnership.
[33:42] Amen.
[33:43] That's why you see these people getting
[33:44] divorced. They want half of everything.
[33:47] But what's half of nothing?
[33:52] joint ears with Christ. If so be that we
[33:56] suffer with him that we might also be
[33:58] glorified together.
[34:00] Amen.
[34:00] So we've got to suffer if you want to be
[34:02] joints.
[34:04] Amen. Hallelujah. Suffer with him that
[34:07] we also might be glorified together.
[34:10] Amen. Here you find the brother Random
[34:12] is telling us that the seed of God is
[34:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[34:16] Amen.
[34:17] Amen. Glory be to his name. Amen.
[34:21] You become a new creature. Did we get
[34:24] back to the slides there?
[34:27] The seed of God is the baptism of the
[34:30] Holy Ghost.
[34:34] Amen. Let's see if they can find me
[34:37] here.
[34:39] Amen. We're coming to the slides now.
[34:41] So, you become a new creature because
[34:43] you're a seed of God that comes into the
[34:45] earth. You don't have to be babyed and
[34:47] petted and brought into something.
[34:49] Amen. here. Now, Romans 8:15 is going to
[34:52] reestablish this for some of you who
[34:54] say, "Oh, I I I need further scriptures,
[34:56] brother. Further scriptures about this
[34:58] predestinated to adoption, spirit of
[35:00] adoption." We just read Romans there.
[35:03] Amen. Galatians 4:6 says, "Because you
[35:07] are sons, Galatians 4:6, because you are
[35:10] sons, God had sent forth his spirit of
[35:13] his son into your hearts."
[35:15] Amen.
[35:16] What is that? The Holy Ghost.
[35:19] Because you are sons, God has sent his
[35:21] spirit.
[35:22] Amen.
[35:23] He's not sending his spirit to anyone
[35:24] else.
[35:26] The rain has come for you.
[35:29] Amen.
[35:29] Come on now.
[35:31] The rain has come for you.

[35:46] AMEN. WE'VE got to call upon his name.
[35:48] Amen.
[35:49] Amen. What do you think Joshua was doing
[35:50] there that day when he called the sun to
[35:52] attention? WHEN HE CALLED the moon to
[35:54] attention?
[35:56] What do you think we did here at
[35:57] Mother's Day when it was going to rain?
[35:58] Prophesied to be raining.
[36:00] Amen.
[36:00] According to these modern prophets,
[36:03] sons of God called to their father and
[36:05] said, "There shall be no rain."
[36:06] Amen.
[36:07] Amen. What did I do there? In a split
[36:09] second, I took it from Joshua and I
[36:11] brought it to a present tense.
[36:12] Amen. Amen.
[36:14] And I can even bring it in your future
[36:16] prophecy over your life right now
[36:18] that if you believe on the Lord, Amen,
[36:20] nothing shall be impossible unto you.
[36:22] If you raise up to your sunship and your
[36:24] authority, nothing shall be impossible
[36:26] unto you.
[36:28] Amen. Let's go quickly to 1
[36:30] Thessalonians chapter 2. Amen. Verse 11.

[36:39] this morning. It's all mixed.
[36:42] I'm preparing your appetite.
[36:45] I'm giving you spiritual biryani.
[36:48] Amen. Hallelujah.
[36:51] 1 Thessalonians 2:1.
[36:54] As you know, we exhorted. What does that
[36:57] word exalted mean? Now, learn fathers
[37:00] pushes you to succeed.
[37:02] One of the meanings of that word exhort.
[37:05] Encourages.
[37:06] Yes. Amen.
[37:07] Now, sometimes father's words can be
[37:09] very destructive on their children.
[37:12] If you continually put them down,
[37:16] you are to praise them when they do good
[37:17] things and correct them when they are
[37:19] wrong.
[37:21] Sometimes all their children hear is
[37:23] correction, correction, correction.
[37:25] They never hear a good word.
[37:27] Well done, good son.
[37:29] Didn't Jesus on Mount Transfiguration,
[37:32] this is my beloved son.
[37:34] Hallelujah.
[37:35] Whom I am well pleased.
[37:38] You know what fathers do? They go tell
[37:41] the mother you did well.
[37:44] Now the mother was where your father
[37:45] said you did very well.
[37:51] Now I know I know it's mostly here in
[37:53] the Indian community.
[37:55] We have a go between
[37:58] it's like you can't express your heart
[38:02] right but here now you know how we
[38:05] exalted we pushed you to succeed
[38:07] how we encouraged you and comforted
[38:10] comfort fathers learn Paul is telling
[38:13] about his attribute as a father
[38:15] do you know Paul had sons Timothy Titus
[38:20] Onimus
[38:22] he had sons
[38:24] I push
[38:25] I encourage you.
[38:27] Amen.
[38:28] Comforted means to console, to support,
[38:30] to reassure.
[38:32] Amen.
[38:32] Because children need reassurance.
[38:35] Children sometimes growing up in life,
[38:36] they don't know who they really are.
[38:37] They're trying to find themselves.
[38:40] Reassure them.
[38:42] Son, if you continue on this right
[38:43] track,
[38:44] I reassure you, you shall succeed.
[38:47] You shall come out the right way.
[38:50] Amen. You need to guide your children
[38:52] every step of the way. Don't leave them
[38:54] to the world to grow them up and bring
[38:56] them up. Amen. They were given to you.
[38:58] Amen. Not until a certain age only. Lead
[39:01] them and guide them. Give them wisdom.
[39:03] Amen.
[39:05] Amen.
[39:07] Here's the last part. The last part is
[39:10] instruct. The last part charged.
[39:13] So I exhorted. I comforted first.
[39:18] Not the other way. Don't only charge.
[39:23] Charge means to instruct, control, give
[39:25] instruction.
[39:26] Amen.
[39:27] So I exhorted, comforted, and charged
[39:30] every one of you as a father dock his
[39:32] children.
[39:33] Amen.
[39:35] You see, that's the biblical way. He's
[39:37] telling you like a father does to his
[39:39] children. So what are we learning your
[39:40] fathers? I'm going to say it again now.
[39:43] First, you
[39:45] push them to succeed. You encourage
[39:47] them. And when they succeed, you reward
[39:50] them.
[39:51] Amen.
[39:52] Right. Then they need comfort and
[39:54] comforted.
[39:57] Console, support, reassure,
[40:02] then charge.
[40:03] Amen.
[40:04] Instruct, give instruction.
[40:06] Yes.
[40:07] Every one of you as your father do his
[40:09] children. Amen. Then in verse 12, that
[40:12] you walk worthy of God who had called
[40:15] you unto his kingdom and glory.
[40:17] Amen.
[40:18] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. How many of you
[40:21] love the scriptures?
[40:22] Amen.
[40:22] That's reaffirming who we are in Jesus
[40:24] Christ.
[40:26] Amen. Hallelujah. I tell you, if you're
[40:29] speaking to any sickness, keep speaking
[40:30] to it.
[40:32] Amen.
[40:32] If it won't leave, Amen. Maybe it's
[40:34] stubborn, you keep speaking to it.
[40:36] You keep speaking the word. Amen.
[40:38] Hallelujah.
[40:40] Amen.
[40:40] Amen. Hallelujah. I'm doing things,
[40:43] Amen. that may seem ridiculous to
[40:44] people.
[40:45] I'm not accepting any disease, any
[40:47] sickness.
[40:48] Amen. I'm speaking to any situation.
[40:51] Amen. There's no mountain that must
[40:52] stand in my way. Some come to me. Oh,
[40:54] leave me alone. I'm just a heal.
[40:57] I don't want any heels in my way.
[41:00] I want a clear pathway.
[41:01] Hallelujah.
[41:03] Amen. How many of you know you can speak
[41:05] sickness out of your life?
[41:07] Some of them tell you, "Hey, my father
[41:08] had cancer. My father had a history of
[41:10] heart disease." Don't accept that. Amen.
[41:13] Cut off their generational curse. Amen.
[41:15] Say, Lord, I thank you, Lord, that I
[41:17] have a perfect, welllete body.
[41:20] I thank you, Lord, that sugar diabetes
[41:21] DOESN'T TROUBLE MY BODY. I THANK YOU,
[41:23] LORD, THAT ALL MY arteries are flowing.
[41:25] Oh God, flowing with blood. There's no
[41:27] blocked arteries. Oh God, I thank you,
[41:29] Lord, that my cholesterol levels are
[41:31] normal. I thank you, Lord, that I have
[41:33] no cancer. Oh Lord, I thank you, Lord,
[41:35] for a well body.
[41:36] I thank you, my blood pressure is
[41:38] normal. Speak the revelation of your
[41:40] faith. Speak a well body. Amen.
[41:44] Lord,
[41:44] thank you Lord.
[41:46] Speak it. Don't don't don't be reactive
[41:48] after or the doctor diagnoses then you
[41:51] want to go pray.
[41:52] Believe me, by that time doubt and
[41:54] reasoning and everything is setting in.
[41:55] That's right.
[41:56] Amen. You really got to be a strong man
[41:58] of faith.
[42:00] Amen.
[42:01] Then now you're laying there on the bed
[42:03] and you're looking at all these people
[42:04] coming and praying for you and then now
[42:06] you want people to feel sorry for you.
[42:09] They're telling you don't confess
[42:10] negative thing. Ah, he's not going
[42:12] through that. See how he's talking? He's
[42:15] not feeling the pain. He's telling me
[42:16] when I'm feeling the pain, he's saying,
[42:17] "I'm going to say there's no pain. I'm
[42:19] pain free. Praise the Lord."
[42:22] Hey,
[42:24] that's how we humans think.
[42:27] But the brother is coming to speak faith
[42:29] into you.
[42:33] Amen.
[42:34] Hallelujah.
[42:36] Let's read Peter. Amen. Let's just
[42:38] reaffirm these scriptures. Peter 1:23.
[42:42] We were born again. But look at what he
[42:44] says. Being born again not of
[42:46] corruptible seed,
[42:48] but of incorruptible
[42:50] by the word of God, which liveth and
[42:52] abideth forever. For all flesh is as
[42:54] grass, and all the glory of man as the
[42:57] flower of grass. The grass witherth, and
[42:59] the flower thereof fadeth away. But the
[43:01] word of the Lord endureth forever. And
[43:04] this is the word which by the gospel is
[43:06] preached unto you.
[43:07] Amen.
[43:08] Now, we know the word is a seed. Now
[43:10] quickly I want to go to this in first uh
[43:13] Timothy 5 and1
[43:16] first Timothy 5 and 1 to show you
[43:19] something here.
[43:22] It says rebuke not an elder
[43:26] but entreat him as a father.
[43:28] Amen.
[43:30] Right.
[43:31] And the younger men as brethren.
[43:33] Right. Amen.
[43:35] What is the younger men? Everyone say
[43:36] the younger man has
[43:39] Hey, how you brew? L man. Now I know
[43:43] this is foreign for the overseas people.
[43:45] I'm sorry. They don't know what I'm
[43:46] talking about here.
[43:51] We are brothers.
[43:53] And I really want this to change in this
[43:55] church because there's a familiar spirit
[43:57] amongst us.
[43:58] That's right.
[43:59] We don't respect officers. We don't
[44:01] respect people. We don't respect our
[44:03] brothers and our sisters. I don't want
[44:05] you to call anyone on firstname basis.
[44:08] It's brother this and brother that and
[44:09] sister this and sister that.
[44:13] Amen.
[44:13] If you got a pet name for someone in the
[44:15] confines of this church and in the
[44:17] confines of the church hours, you
[44:19] address them as brother and sister.
[44:21] Amen.
[44:26] Amen.
[44:27] Amen.
[44:28] They are your brother and sister.
[44:30] Amen.
[44:31] Let's maintain that.
[44:33] Yes. Amen. You got to have respect.
[44:36] You've got to address them in their
[44:37] office.
[44:38] Brother, sister,
[44:41] who didn't I just describe that they are
[44:43] joint ears with Jesus?
[44:45] They are the brother and sister of
[44:46] Jesus.
[44:47] Amen.
[44:49] And you refer to them anyhow.
[44:51] Call them anyhow.
[44:54] That's right.
[44:55] Don't we call Lord Jesus?
[44:58] Amen.
[44:59] Now, we're not asking you to go to that
[45:01] extreme. We are saying brother Brother.
[45:04] Amen.
[45:04] Now, I know it's going to take some
[45:06] training.
[45:07] You may slip up the first time. It's
[45:08] okay. But the person now listen. How you
[45:11] going to help them? The one who is
[45:13] calling you. When they call you by your
[45:14] first name, like say it's brother this.
[45:17] Amen.
[45:17] It will imprint in their memory.
[45:22] Lot of sheepy screens here. It will
[45:24] imprint on their memory.
[45:28] Correct them once and they'll always
[45:30] remember it.
[45:31] What am I saying? Why am I saying
[45:32] correct them? Help them.
[45:34] I'm saying help them get accustomed to
[45:36] these things.
[45:37] Amen. Amen.
[45:40] When you're going, "Okay, brother. I'll
[45:42] see you later."
[45:43] Yes.
[45:44] Okay, sister.
[45:46] Pray for me. I'll pray for you, brother.
[45:48] Amen.
[45:49] Amen. Hallelujah. This is Christian
[45:52] conduct.
[45:53] Amen. Yes.
[45:54] This is the way we ought to conduct
[45:55] oursel in the house of the Lord.
[45:57] Why am I saying these things? Young
[45:59] people are growing up not knowing these
[46:00] things. They're looking at the older
[46:02] people talk to one another like that and
[46:03] what example are we setting for them?
[46:08] The next generation will be so casual.
[46:10] They'll come to church in in their uh
[46:14] tracksuits
[46:18] because that's the generation. That's
[46:19] how they gone.
[46:21] They don't feel the need for reverence
[46:23] and respect.
[46:26] Amen.
[46:28] Rebuke not an elder and treat him as a
[46:30] father. Second Timothy 1 and2
[46:34] to Timothy my beloved son. Talking about
[46:38] sons now in the gospel.
[46:41] To Timothy my dearly beloved son.
[46:44] Amen.
[46:45] Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
[46:48] father and Jes Christ Jesus our Lord.
[46:52] Go to Titus 1 and4.
[46:57] Titus 1 and4
[47:01] says to Titus my own son
[47:04] after the commun common faith
[47:07] grace mercy and peace from God saying
[47:10] greeting to all his sons.
[47:12] Thank you Lord.
[47:16] You may be saying why do you speak about
[47:18] this? Because
[47:20] you may not want to believe this. I have
[47:22] sons.
[47:25] Amen. Amen.
[47:26] I have sons in the gospel.
[47:27] Amen.
[47:28] That I'm training up.
[47:30] I am grooming up.
[47:31] Amen. That when it's time for me to
[47:33] leave this place,
[47:35] sons have risen.
[47:37] Where do I learn this from? We had a
[47:39] father.
[47:40] Amen.
[47:41] We had a good spiritual father in this
[47:42] house.
[47:43] Who raised up sons.
[47:46] We got generations of preachers here. We
[47:48] got brother Sani.
[47:50] [clears throat]
[47:52] How many years ago was that brother
[47:53] Sani?
[47:55] What? 40
[47:56] 40 years ago.
[47:59] Amen. When brother Joshua came in, he
[48:01] saw the potential in brother Joshua
[48:03] raised up sons.
[48:06] Amen. Now, a lot of you may think that I
[48:10] am in here because of an inheritance.
[48:14] I'm telling you, you're solely mistaken.
[48:16] Amen.
[48:17] You ask brother Joshua if my father ever
[48:19] favored me above him.
[48:22] Ask him that.
[48:26] If you ever know anything, you would
[48:28] know the amount of reproof and
[48:29] correction we got.
[48:31] Amen. You that are seated here and have
[48:33] been in the ministry for years and all
[48:34] these years, you would know that I was
[48:36] given no extra preference over the other
[48:38] brothers to preach here.
[48:39] Amen.
[48:41] Right.
[48:43] So, it wasn't a thing to push someone
[48:44] forward. I am here because when God
[48:46] ascended on high, he gave gifts unto
[48:48] men.
[48:48] Amen.
[48:49] And he gave some pastors, teachers,
[48:50] apostles. and you will reaffirm that.
[48:54] Amen.
[48:55] Now we have raised another crop of
[48:58] ministers that are coming on.

[49:01] progression of the gospel.
[49:02] Amen.
[49:03] Did you hear what a fine job brother
[49:04] Jeffer did on Wednesday?
[49:06] Amen. Another crop is coming in on the
[49:08] scene.
[49:09] Amen. What are we doing? We are raising
[49:10] sons in the gospel.
[49:12] The gospel must go on.
[49:14] Amen.
[49:15] Amen. This is not about selfish motives.
[49:18] This is about seeing the kingdom of God
[49:20] established on the earth. Amen.
[49:22] Amen.
[49:22] Amen.
[49:24] So here I was telling you about Pastor
[49:27] Ronnie and how he stood firm for the
[49:28] word of the Lord.
[49:30] The reason we can stand firm is because
[49:32] he never deviated from the word.
[49:34] Amen. Where there was a dot, he put a
[49:36] dot. Where the tea was crossed, he
[49:38] crossed the tea.
[49:39] Amen. He wanted to see the house of God
[49:41] established. He had a desire for the
[49:43] things of God. He had a concern for the
[49:45] people of God.
[49:48] Amen. And he labored all these years. He
[49:50] swed. Amen. So that another one can come
[49:52] and water
[49:53] and another one can come and reap an
[49:55] harvest.
[49:56] Amen. Amen. Amen. Didn't we see
[49:59] progression? Amen. Hallelujah. Even
[50:01] after he went on, Amen. the church has
[50:03] been growing. Amen. The church has been
[50:05] blossoming. Amen. Didn't we see the
[50:06] young people get baptized? Make a
[50:08] commitment for the word of the Lord. The
[50:10] church is prospering.
[50:12] Hallelujah.
[50:13] Amen.
[50:14] Thank you, Lord.

[50:22] name.
[50:22] Thank you, Lord.
[50:23] Amen. God, you say he's a father. Yes.
[50:25] Let's turn to Psalm 68:3. Amen. I
[50:28] promise you we're going to finish on
[50:30] time, which means I've got another 12 12
[50:34] minutes.
[50:35] Hallelujah.
[50:37] Everyone say, "Praise the Lord."
[50:39] Praise the Lord.
[50:40] Amen. I got 12 minutes like the 12
[50:42] apostles.
[50:45] Amen.
[50:47] Blessed be the name. I like that. Praise
[50:50] the Lord, brother.

[51:07] Oh, I'm glad. Amen. Let them rejoice
[51:10] before God.
[51:11] Amen.
[51:11] Let them exceedingly rejoice. Sing unto
[51:14] God.
[51:15] Amen. Sing praises to his name.
[51:18] Amen. I like the songs, brother Jeff,
[51:20] you sang today. Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:22] Amen.
[51:22] Sing praises to his name.
[51:24] Amen.
[51:25] Extol him that rided upon the heavens by
[51:28] his name. Yeah.
[51:29] Amen.
[51:30] Amen.
[51:30] And rejoice before him.
[51:33] Why?
[51:34] Thank you, Lord.
[51:34] He's a what? You say, "I don't have a
[51:36] father."
[51:37] Look here.
[51:38] He's a father
[51:40] to the fatherless.
[51:42] Amen.
[51:44] And he's a what? a judge of the widows.

[51:52] fatherless.
[51:53] Amen.
[51:54] What is he saying here?
[51:55] I'm a father to the fatherless.
[51:58] They are my
[52:00] They are [clears throat] my people. I
[52:04] take care of them.
[52:07] You mess with them, I'll sort you out.
[52:10] I'm a father to the fatherless
[52:13] and I'm a judge to the widow.
[52:19] Is God in his holy habitation?
[52:21] Now very quickly we're going to go
[52:22] through this in the mind of God. Now
[52:25] remember God is a spirit.
[52:27] Amen.
[52:28] All right. Or can I say
[52:31] let me just leave it there. God is a
[52:33] spirit. Right.
[52:35] And in him was attributes.
[52:39] Before there was anything in him was
[52:41] attributes, thoughts in his mind. One of
[52:44] the thoughts was Jesus Christ.
[52:47] Amen.
[52:48] He had two thoughts. He had Jesus Christ
[52:52] and he had you
[52:55] sons and daughters.
[52:56] Amen.
[52:59] And both have to be expressed in flesh.
[53:03] Right? So in every seed he's written
[53:05] your part of the story. So what did he
[53:07] do? He put his seed within you.
[53:10] That seed gene within you. When you were
[53:12] born into the earth, that seed gene was
[53:14] already in you.
[53:16] Amen.
[53:17] You may have grown up in life for 20
[53:19] years, 30 years, 40 years without that
[53:21] gene being germinated to life, without
[53:24] that seed coming to life. But in you was
[53:27] a seed of God.
[53:28] Amen. God lets you run through your
[53:30] course of life until your appointed time
[53:32] when light would strike that seed.
[53:34] Right. Amen.
[53:36] Amen. So when light strikes the seed,
[53:38] you've got to water the seed.
[53:41] Amen.
[53:43] Okay, let me go through the process.
[53:45] When when you have a seed, what you've
[53:46] got to do first? Bury the seed.
[53:49] First, you've got to bury the seed.
[53:51] So the seed must be buried in Christ.
[53:54] Then you've got to water the seed. Then
[53:57] you've got to expose it to sunlight.
[54:00] Amen. So you've got to bury yourself in
[54:02] the word of Christ. Don't leave yourself
[54:04] unwatered.
[54:05] Don't leave the seed unwarted
[54:07] without sunlight.
[54:09] And when it receives that, it will start
[54:11] to grow into the full potential of a son
[54:13] and daughter of God. Now, very quickly,
[54:15] let's go now to that quote. Amen. I
[54:17] think it's slide number
[54:19] [clears throat] Let's go to slide five.
[54:22] We'll go through these slides and we're
[54:23] going to close. I'm going to go through
[54:24] it as quickly as I can. Amen.
[54:26] Hallelujah.
[54:27] Amen.
[54:29] So we said God was a spirit, right? God
[54:32] could not fellowship in the spirit. So
[54:35] God became a man with us. This is the
[54:37] prophet. Now you couldn't back there
[54:38] because you were just a word in him.
[54:41] So back there Jesus was a thought. You
[54:45] were a thought. Jesus was an attribute.
[54:48] You were an attribute.
[54:49] So you couldn't fellowship.
[54:53] But now he manifested you and now he
[54:56] wants you to fellowship with him.
[54:58] Amen.
[54:58] Then he came down was made flesh so he
[55:01] could perfectly fellowship with you.
[55:03] Amen.
[55:04] Right?
[55:07] Then he goes on to say when he was
[55:09] expressed in flesh now the spirit moved
[55:11] on him again.
[55:13] Amen. Because there's unwritten parts of
[55:16] the seed in unwritten parts of the story
[55:18] in your seed.
[55:22] Your story is not complete yet.
[55:24] There are chapters yet to be read in
[55:26] your life.
[55:28] There are chapters yet to unfold in your
[55:30] own life.
[55:32] Everyone following my thought?
[55:34] The spirit moved on him again because
[55:37] there was some word had been wrote about
[55:39] him. You see it wasn't the full word
[55:42] wasn't revealed when he came there at
[55:43] the Jordan River. There was no word
[55:45] written about him.
[55:47] Amen.
[55:50] The
[55:51] some word had been wrote about him come
[55:53] from God through the prophet and he was
[55:55] led see what the unfolding word written
[55:57] about him. He was led to the slaughter
[55:59] like a lamb and the spirit moved upon
[56:01] him and led him and sent him to Calvar's
[56:04] cross. There he died and everything that
[56:06] was spoke of him in his death was
[56:08] fulfilled. Why now? There must be a
[56:10] purpose for everything. To bring light
[56:12] and life to all his predestinated seed
[56:14] of God that was upon the earth.
[56:17] Oh, say thank you, Lord.
[56:19] He died so that I can live.
[56:22] He brought the way to do it. He says
[56:25] here is the seed. The spirit brings the
[56:27] life transforming sons and daughters of
[56:29] God from the world of this dark chaos
[56:32] into be sons and daughters of God.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:35] Amen. And some of us were heading for
[56:37] good for nothing people
[56:38] but the light struck at the right time.
[56:41] Amen. Changed our lives around.
[56:43] Thank you Lord.
[56:45] Now if we are his sons his attributes he
[56:47] says you were in the loins of your
[56:48] father but your father could not have
[56:50] any fellowship with you until you was
[56:52] transformed into a body of flesh.
[56:55] Brother Caleb right now will experience
[56:57] what I'm talking about.
[57:00] His seed is still in a beding ground
[57:02] and he cannot have fellowship yet with
[57:04] that seed. Whether it's a boy and a girl
[57:07] or a girl, only the Lord knows right
[57:09] now.
[57:11] Right, Sister Sarah? We don't know yet.
[57:14] Right.
[57:15] Only the Lord knows. But that child
[57:19] that's being formed is predestinated to
[57:22] come on the earth.
[57:23] Amen.
[57:24] Yes.
[57:24] Amen.
[57:26] I'm excited for new sons coming on the
[57:28] earth.
[57:28] Amen.
[57:29] Have we got a name yet? You're not going
[57:30] to reveal it now, but we know there's
[57:32] one Judah coming forth.
[57:35] And I know he's going to raise up the
[57:36] praise in this church.
[57:39] Take it to another level.
[57:41] How many of you know you represent your
[57:42] name?
[57:44] Your name represents your character.
[57:45] There's no way we can name him praise
[57:47] and then he comes here and he's mute.
[57:50] [clears throat]
[57:53] He's going to shake things up.
[57:57] Amen.
[57:59] Hallelujah.
[58:00] So, you get what I mean? Brother Jeff
[58:02] knows what I'm talking. He can't have
[58:03] fellowship with his son as yet
[58:05] because he's not fully expressed on the
[58:06] earth.
[58:09] So you were in the loins of your father,
[58:10] but your father could not have had any
[58:12] fellowship with you until you was
[58:14] transformed into a body of flesh. You're
[58:16] an attribute of your father, not your
[58:18] mother. Your father
[58:20] who carries the blood.
[58:22] You may look like your mother, but you
[58:25] got the blood of your
[58:27] father.
[58:30] The germ lays in the father.
[58:33] And now your mother was an incubator
[58:35] that bear you bear the seed of your
[58:38] father and the earth in flesh is also an
[58:42] incubator. So now he's taking the earth
[58:44] as the body of flesh giving birth to you
[58:47] that bears the seed of God.
[58:49] Amen.
[58:50] Now if you were if you are a son and
[58:52] daughter of God then you were in the
[58:54] beginning you were in God at the
[58:56] beginning. You're his attribute. St.
[58:58] John 1 says in the beginning was the
[59:00] word. The word was with God. The word
[59:03] was God. And the word was made flesh and
[59:05] dwelt amongst us.
[59:06] Amen.
[59:06] It says, now here's the important part.
[59:09] Then you were in the loins of Jesus.
[59:13] Amen.
[59:13] And went to Calvary with him.
[59:16] And you died with him.
[59:18] And you raised with him. And today we're
[59:20] sitting in heavenly places in him.
[59:22] Amen.
[59:23] Filled with his spirit. Sons and
[59:25] daughters of God, die with him. Raised
[59:28] with him. Give God praise. Amen.
[59:31] Hallelujah. [applause]
[59:34] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[59:36] You being flesh and him being flesh. See
[59:39] now both flesh is now expressed.
[59:41] Amen.
[59:42] First it was a thought in God's mind.
[59:44] But then he expressed Jesus. Then
[59:46] through time you were expressed. Now you
[59:48] being flesh and him being flesh then you
[59:51] can fellowship now.
[59:52] Amen.
[59:54] Ah but I leave Jesus to fellowship alone
[59:56] on Wednesdays.
[1:00:00] I feel s I like my alone time.
[1:00:04] I don't like to be crammed.
[1:00:06] I want my space.
[1:00:11] Jesus is so possessive.
[1:00:14] I'm an independent woman.
[1:00:18] He want to see me the whole day.
[1:00:23] Isn't that the modern woman?
[1:00:26] Give me my space. Why you keep phoning
[1:00:28] me?
[1:00:30] Especially when you're poor. Hey,
[1:00:33] why you keep phoning me the whole day?
[1:00:38] They want their space.
[1:00:41] Don't keep troubling me. I want my girl
[1:00:44] time.
[1:00:46] I want to go with my friends. I want my
[1:00:48] alone time.
[1:00:52] Amen.
[1:00:56] So he says here, where are we now?
[1:01:01] 237, you being flesh and him being
[1:01:03] flesh, then you can fellowship now cuz
[1:01:05] he was God's attribute of love. So Jesus
[1:01:08] is God's attribute of love.
[1:01:10] Amen.
[1:01:10] Amen. Jesus is God's attribute of love.
[1:01:12] God is love. And Jesus was God's
[1:01:14] attribute of love. And when the
[1:01:16] attribute of love was displayed, which
[1:01:18] was God himself, all the attributes that
[1:01:21] hung onto him came to him. Amen.
[1:01:24] All the father had given will come to
[1:01:26] me.
[1:01:26] Amen.
[1:01:27] Right. So did you learn that?
[1:01:30] Every attribute that God thought of
[1:01:32] Jesus came to him when he was expressed
[1:01:36] right. Every attribute that God thought
[1:01:38] of you to be an amateur son of God is
[1:01:40] now coming to you. Now we can fellowship
[1:01:43] was through the riches of his word and
[1:01:44] in you which you are part of. You are
[1:01:46] part of the word cuz he was the word in
[1:01:49] the beginning. You're the word now. Here
[1:01:51] he says every seed will bring forth of
[1:01:52] his kind reestablishing the thought you
[1:01:55] must be a powerful person.
[1:01:57] You must be a a son and daughter full of
[1:01:59] power
[1:02:00] because his seed can't be powerless.
[1:02:04] Just understand that one thought. If you
[1:02:06] don't understand anything about today's
[1:02:07] message when I'm preaching about our
[1:02:09] father is God.
[1:02:12] I am telling you that you are powerful.
[1:02:16] [crying]
[1:02:18] Every seed will bring forth of its kind.
[1:02:20] If you are seed of God, an attribute, a
[1:02:22] son of God, then the word of God is sown
[1:02:24] in you. And then when you hear the word
[1:02:26] of God, my sheep heareth my voice, a
[1:02:28] stranger they won't follow. Then every
[1:02:30] seed comes forth after its own kind.
[1:02:33] Son of God, daughter of God, power the
[1:02:35] spoken word in your mouth. If he said,
[1:02:37] "Let there be and it was." You can say,
[1:02:38] "Let there be and it was." If he spoke
[1:02:40] to a mountain, I can speak to a
[1:02:42] mountain. If he walked on water, I can.
[1:02:45] If he walked on water, I can walk on
[1:02:47] water. If he spoke to the winds and
[1:02:48] waves, I can speak to the winds and
[1:02:50] waves.
[1:02:52] See, he says, "Don't fear anymore. For
[1:02:55] every forain predestinated seed of God
[1:02:57] shall come to life when that light
[1:02:59] spreads across the earth."
[1:03:00] Amen.
[1:03:01] Of the glorious gospel in every age,
[1:03:03] it'll bring forth a crop that God
[1:03:04] ordained it to. He had raised it from
[1:03:06] the dead.
[1:03:07] Yes.
[1:03:08] Now, the seed don't need no pumping up.
[1:03:10] Go to the next one. You know, a genuine
[1:03:13] seed, you don't need to pump chemicals
[1:03:14] into it. Right?
[1:03:16] You don't need no pumping up. The power
[1:03:18] is within itself.
[1:03:20] You see me telling you about yourself,
[1:03:22] you don't need me to pump you up.
[1:03:25] I can't inject anything extra than
[1:03:28] what's the seed in you.
[1:03:29] The power lays in you already. All that
[1:03:32] I'm doing is making you recognize the
[1:03:34] power that's within you.
[1:03:36] I can't manufacture the power within
[1:03:38] you.
[1:03:38] Amen.
[1:03:41] No pumping up. Its power is within
[1:03:43] itself. It needs no priming. Yes sir.
[1:03:46] Its own life is in itself. That's the
[1:03:48] way the seed of God is in a man's heart.
[1:03:50] The life of God is within an individual,
[1:03:52] not in the church, in you.
[1:03:54] Amen.
[1:03:56] You make up the church collectively, but
[1:03:58] each of you are powerhouse.
[1:04:01] I'm closing with this one quote now.
[1:04:03] Amen. And this is going to sum it up.
[1:04:06] Hallelujah.
[1:04:07] Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:08] Amen.
[1:04:11] Glory be to his name. Amen. This is
[1:04:13] slide 19 now. The very God that stood
[1:04:15] back there on the mythical platform of
[1:04:17] eternities and rolled the words off of
[1:04:20] his and created those things give you
[1:04:23] the privilege to be his son.
[1:04:24] Amen.
[1:04:25] Say thank you Lord.
[1:04:26] Thank you Lord.
[1:04:27] And you're a part of him.
[1:04:29] Amen.
[1:04:29] And God dwells in mankind and man
[1:04:33] himself is deity.
[1:04:34] Hallelujah.
[1:04:35] How many of you know what that word
[1:04:36] deity means?
[1:04:37] Divine.
[1:04:38] Amen.
[1:04:40] This is the prophet now.
[1:04:41] Yes.
[1:04:42] What message is he preaching?
[1:04:43] resurrection of Lazarus.
[1:04:45] Amen.
[1:04:47] He made you a part of him, gave you the
[1:04:49] privilege to be his son. God dwells in
[1:04:51] mankind and man himself is divine. Here
[1:04:54] he goes on to say, God dwells in man.
[1:04:56] The Holy Spirit that's in him is God and
[1:04:59] man becomes a son of God, not to
[1:05:02] himself, but the creator lives in the
[1:05:04] creation.
[1:05:05] Amen.
[1:05:07] Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:08] Now watch. When the creator lives in the
[1:05:11] creation, when the Holy Spirit is in
[1:05:12] you, then stand with an unwavering faith
[1:05:15] and ask what you will.
[1:05:17] Amen.
[1:05:18] It'll be done unto you. There he is God.
[1:05:22] Hallelujah.
[1:05:24] God speaking through his creation.
[1:05:26] Amen.
[1:05:28] I'm telling you, this thing is going to
[1:05:29] blow up.
[1:05:30] Amen.
[1:05:32] Right now, you may see it in its
[1:05:33] infancy.
[1:05:34] Maybe right now you may be grasping
[1:05:36] portions of the revelation. But when you
[1:05:38] can fully realize who you are as a son
[1:05:40] and daughter of God, Amen. you can stand
[1:05:43] before any situation.
[1:05:44] Amen.
[1:05:48] And if we become in spirit sons of God,
[1:05:52] deity dwells in the man.
[1:05:54] Amen.
[1:05:55] Then you talk about blind eyes being
[1:05:57] open.
[1:05:58] Amen.
[1:05:59] Then you talk about autism being gone.
[1:06:01] Then you talk about cancer being gone.
[1:06:04] Then you talk about our trouble being
[1:06:05] gone. We'll stop sicknesses.
[1:06:08] We'll stop diseases.
[1:06:12] Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:14] God said nothing is impossible with you
[1:06:16] if you'll believe.
[1:06:17] Amen.
[1:06:18] Dear it is in you.
[1:06:19] How many if you believe here?
[1:06:21] Amen.
[1:06:22] Then he quotes Matthew 17. For verily I
[1:06:25] say unto you, if you have the faith as a
[1:06:27] grain of a mustard seed, you'll say unto
[1:06:30] this mountain, remove hence to yonder
[1:06:32] place, and it shall remove.
[1:06:35] Amen.
[1:06:36] must remove and nothing shall be
[1:06:39] impossible unto God.
[1:06:42] Amen.
[1:06:43] Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:48] Are we reading it right? And nothing
[1:06:50] shall be impossible unto who? Say me.
[1:06:53] Amen.
[1:06:54] Me. The one who has the grave faith, the
[1:06:57] size, even if it's a mustard seed faith.
[1:07:01] But you must speak now. You must speak
[1:07:02] with authority. You must recognize
[1:07:04] yourself as a son and daughter of God.
[1:07:07] We are building up now. We are
[1:07:09] climaxing.
[1:07:10] We are climaxing now.
[1:07:13] You know if they send an atomic rocket
[1:07:15] your way, you can speak to that rocket.
[1:07:18] Stop.
[1:07:20] Yes. Amen.
[1:07:22] They send a bullet your talk about
[1:07:24] matrix. They send a bullet your way. You
[1:07:26] don't have to dodge the bullet.
[1:07:28] They got all these guys.
[1:07:31] Hey,
[1:07:33] you can speak.
[1:07:35] Amen.
[1:07:36] You become a superman on the earth,
[1:07:38] a super daughter on the earth.
[1:07:40] A super son on the earth.
[1:07:42] Speak to your situations. I apologize
[1:07:44] for going 5 minutes over. I didn't mean
[1:07:47] to do that. God bless you. Let's stand
[1:07:49] together. [laughter]
[1:07:52] You know, people like to uh bring
[1:07:54] accusations. He said, "Of course, now
[1:07:56] you went 5 minutes over."
[1:07:59] Amen.
[1:08:00] Glory be to his name.
[1:08:02] Hallelujah.
[1:08:03] Hallelujah.
[1:08:04] Blessed be the name.
[1:08:06] Amen.
[1:08:07] You are son and daughter of God.
[1:08:09] Son and daughter. Son, you are joint
[1:08:12] hairs with Jesus.
[1:08:14] Joint hairs.
[1:08:17] [music]
[1:08:18] Now, how many of you know when you got
[1:08:19] two children at home
[1:08:23] and the one that keeps asking the father
[1:08:25] for something gets it and the one who
[1:08:28] thinks I don't want to trouble my father
[1:08:29] and ask him anything
[1:08:32] doesn't get much
[1:08:35] but both of them are joint hair
[1:08:37] whose fault is it
[1:08:40] whose fault is it
[1:08:41] can he come and bring an accusation
[1:08:42] against the father you only spoil him
[1:08:45] you only buy the things he wants
[1:08:48] But then the father can go to the son,
[1:08:51] ask anything in my name.
[1:08:54] If you ask me anything, I'll buy it for
[1:08:56] you.
[1:08:57] But you're not asking me, son.
[1:09:00] Amen. How many of you know now that God
[1:09:03] said to you, "Ask anything in my name."
[1:09:05] Ask anything in my name. There's nothing
[1:09:08] impossible with God. And you just read
[1:09:10] now in Matthew 17, there's nothing
[1:09:12] impossible with you.
[1:09:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:16] He
[1:09:17] of the father joint ears with the son.
[1:09:20] Amen. Glory be to his name. Let's sing.
[1:09:24] Amen. [clears throat]
[1:09:26] He knows my name.
[1:09:30] Thank you.
[1:09:32] [music]
[1:09:40] I have a maker. [music and singing]
[1:09:45] Oh yes Lord.
[1:09:47] He formed my heart
[1:09:55] [music]
[1:09:55] before [singing]
[1:09:57] even time
[1:09:59] began.
[1:10:02] My [music] life was in.
[1:10:06] Oh son and daughter of God, he knows
[1:10:07] your name. Now sing, he knows my name.
[1:10:11] [music]
[1:10:11] He knows [singing]

[1:15:27] and father you have made sure that we
[1:15:28] have enough provision in this time oh

[1:16:10] the bottom of our hearts, Lord Jesus.
[1:16:12] Lord, we couldn't have asked for a
[1:16:14] better father, Lord. Lord, there are so
[1:16:16] many dying in the world and their father
[1:16:18] is the devil. Lord, who has stripped
[1:16:20] them naked, oh God, who has blinded
[1:16:22] them, oh God, who Lord has given them
[1:16:24] hell for an inheritance, Lord Jesus, has
[1:16:27] given them sicknesses and diseases, oh
[1:16:29] God. What a terrible father he is, oh
[1:16:32] [music] God. But we thank you, Lord, for
[1:16:34] you, oh God, who has given us truth, oh
[1:16:36] God. You have revealed your plan of

[1:16:40] have revealed all seven seals to us. You
[1:16:42] have revealed back, oh God, brought back
[1:16:44] title D to us, oh God, so that we can be
[1:16:47] placed back as sons and daughters of the
[1:16:50] most high God. How we thank you, Father.
[1:16:53] We love you. We appreciate you, Lord. We
[1:16:55] want to say this morning, Lord. We
[1:16:57] reverence you, oh God. We honor you as
[1:16:59] our father, Lord Jesus. And we say,
[1:17:02] Lord, there is none like you, Lord. Oh
[1:17:04] God, you are father of all fathers. Oh
[1:17:07] God, you are king of all kings. You are
[1:17:09] lord of all lords. Oh majesty, you reign
[1:17:12] on high. Oh God, how we love you. We
[1:17:15] bless you, Lord.
[1:17:17] Glory [snorts] be to your mighty name.
[1:17:19] [music]
[1:17:20] Lord, we want to live our lives for you,
[1:17:22] Lord Jesus. We want to surrender all we
[1:17:24] have for you, Lord. [music]
[1:17:26] How we bless your name, Jesus.
[1:17:28] There's none like you, Father.
[1:17:30] We love you, Lord Jesus.
[1:17:33] Lord,
[1:17:34] Father, this morning, Lord, maybe some
[1:17:36] of your children here now standing.
[1:17:38] They may be sick and body. They may have
[1:17:40] a need. They may have a desire.
[1:17:43] Maybe they need finances. And maybe they
[1:17:45] need [music]
[1:17:46] provision in this life. Maybe they need
[1:17:48] a job. Maybe they need a permanent job.
[1:17:51] [music]
[1:17:53] And some want to progress to the next
[1:17:55] phase in their lives. And maybe they
[1:17:56] need a promotion. And the current
[1:17:58] provision is not sustaining them, oh
[1:18:00] God.
[1:18:01] Maybe inflation is causing them, Lord,
[1:18:03] not to be sustained, oh God. But Lord,
[1:18:05] even as you took care of those sparrows,
[1:18:07] we are asking you, Jehovah, Gyra, to
[1:18:09] come, Lord, and meet the need, oh God.
[1:18:12] Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:12] I pray you'll grant to them a promotion.
[1:18:14] I pray you'll grant to them finances,
[1:18:16] Lord Jesus.
[1:18:17] And Lord, I pray, Lord, those that are
[1:18:19] desiring the sincere word of God, to
[1:18:21] grow in the spiritual things of God,
[1:18:23] desiring more of you, Lord. I pray,
[1:18:26] Lord, that their couple overflow, Lord,
[1:18:28] that they will grow in revelation and in
[1:18:30] wisdom, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:18:32] And Lord, I pray Lord that even as their
[1:18:34] soul prospers, let them prosper, Lord
[1:18:36] Jesus.
[1:18:37] Hallelujah.
[1:18:37] As they grow up in the word and build
[1:18:39] upon their most holy faith, may they
[1:18:41] prosper in the natural things in [music]
[1:18:43] life. May they be in health, oh God. I
[1:18:45] pray you'll heal every sick person.
[1:18:47] Lord, I pray, Lord, that you will touch
[1:18:49] them now, Father. And Lord, even as you
[1:18:51] said healing is the children's bread, I
[1:18:53] pray Lord you'll stretch forth your hand
[1:18:55] to heal, to [singing] deliver, to set
[1:18:57] free. Oh God, joint ears with the son.
