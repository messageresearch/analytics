[10:02] seated at this
[10:04] time. Amen. We're going to call the
[10:06] Sunday school for this
[10:17] morning. Amen. Whilst we're waiting for
[10:19] them, is there anyone else that will be
[10:21] given our item this morning or wants to
[10:23] say
[10:24] anything apart from our brother Romesh?
[10:26] Amen.
[10:41] I greet you all in the wonderful name of
[10:43] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Today
[10:45] I will be reading a poem called
[10:47] Wonderful Mother. God made a wonderful
[10:50] mother, a mother, kind yet bold. He made
[10:53] a smile of the sunshine and he molded
[10:55] her heart of pure gold. In her eyes he
[10:58] placed bright shining stars. In her
[11:00] cheeks fair roses you see God made a
[11:03] wonderful mother and he gave that dear
[11:05] mother to me.
[11:11] I greet you all in the wonderful name of
[11:14] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Today
[11:17] I'm going to be saying a Bible verse on
[11:20] Mother's Day. Proverbs 31 verse 2530.
[11:26] strength and honor uh her clothing and
[11:30] she shall rejoice in time to come. She
[11:34] opened her mouth with the wisdom and in
[11:38] her tongue is the law the law of
[11:42] kindness. She looked well to the ways of
[11:46] her household and eatth not the bread of
[11:51] idleness. Her children
[11:54] array and called
[11:57] her her husband also, and he praisth
[12:02] her. Many daughters have done
[12:05] virtuously, but thou exalt them all.
[12:09] Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain.
[12:15] But a woman that feared the
[12:20] Lord, she shall be praised.
[12:28] Amen. The first preacher that ever can
[12:31] get a child is a woman. There is four or
[12:34] five gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[12:37] John, and a mother. And a mother should
[12:40] be filled with the Holy Ghost as a
[12:42] woman. A woman who can teach her
[12:44] children how to pray and to know about
[12:47] God and so
[12:52] forth. Lord, we would not by no means
[12:55] forget to thank you for real mothers.
[12:57] For we know that we have such living
[12:59] today, real genuine mothers. God bless
[13:02] them. They are great churches to us and
[13:04] we pray that you'll continue to be with
[13:06] them, Lord. And may they live happy and
[13:09] see the fruit of their womb serving God.
[13:11] And we pray God that those who wear the
[13:13] white rose this morning or the white
[13:15] flower to say that their mother has
[13:17] passed beyond the scene of action today
[13:20] may Lord God they rest in peace and
[13:22] their labors follow them. Grant it Lord.
[13:24] Amen. Thank you.
[13:30] Amen. Thank you for that. The Sunday
[13:32] school we call our brother Amish
[13:34] forward. Amen.
[13:38] Amen. I greet you all in the wonderful
[13:40] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[13:43] this morning. Amen. Share a little
[13:46] testimony on Wednesday night. Amen. As I
[13:49] was coming down to church and at the
[13:52] main robots, Palmia
[13:54] robots, I don't know, I felt very
[13:57] dizzy and uh virtually, you know, went
[14:01] to knock the next guy in front of me.
[14:05] But you know what? The acceleration
[14:08] pedal didn't even move.
[14:12] And I was and as I was driving, I said,
[14:14] "Lord, you know what? I'm going to the
[14:16] house of the Lord, and please take me
[14:17] home safely." And you know, fear grips
[14:20] hold of you. Let's be honest about that.
[14:22] That's a fact. But the truth is, he said
[14:24] he'll never leave you, neither will he
[14:26] forsake you. That's the truth. Amen.
[14:29] Facts will tell you, you know what? This
[14:31] is what's going to happen to you. So, as
[14:33] I was driving, I said, "You know what? I
[14:35] hope brother show is at church today
[14:36] because I'll want to follow him so that
[14:40] I can go safely home. So when I came to
[14:42] the service and you know I I couldn't
[14:45] stand I was just sitting and I wasn't uh
[14:48] like you know singing you know giving it
[14:50] all my best amen. And then as you know
[14:54] the word has to become as the word has
[14:56] been preached and then we after hearing
[14:59] the word you know there's inspiration
[15:02] takes in. Amen.
[15:04] faith builds up. Amen. Muscles. Amen.
[15:06] And then we started to have a prayer
[15:08] meeting. Amen. And that's when hell went
[15:11] loose. Amen. The devil began to tremble
[15:15] and fear. Amen. When the saints began to
[15:17] pray, the Lord will have his way. That's
[15:19] what it is all about. Amen. And I urge
[15:22] you all, Amen. You know, I'm saying this
[15:24] with great
[15:25] sincerity. Never forsake the assembly of
[15:28] yourselves together. Because I believe
[15:30] if I do I wasn't here on that night,
[15:34] wherever I
[15:37] was, I'll let you think about that. God
[15:39] bless
[15:44] you. He's worthy of all praise. Let's
[15:46] just be reverent in his presence.
[15:49] Amen. Thank you,
[15:51] [Music]
[15:56] Jesus. Hallelujah. So just raise your
[15:59] [Music]
[16:05] hands. Before this day, no man could
[16:10] tell us just
[16:14] where we came from and where we go from
[16:18] here.
[16:23] Oh, but through the eyes of the prophet
[16:27] God revealed to
[16:30] us before God was God all the way to
[16:35] future home. Sing new
[16:39] things, new things are being
[16:43] declared. I know very soon I'll be

[16:56] into the
[16:58] invisible the

[17:02] inconceivable. Fate to believe for the
[17:07] impossible.
[17:08] Oh this new
[17:11] day. Oh the angel of God.

[17:19] years. He
[17:23] appeared. He's your fixing things for us
[17:26] to
[17:27] leave.
[17:30] Oh, he's waving visions of ourselves
[17:34] before
[17:37] us. So we can walk step by step into
[17:41] what we behold.
[17:44] Seeing new
[17:45] things, new things I've been
[17:49] declared. I know very soon I'll be
[17:52] raptured out of here. The angel of God

[18:25] has prepared for those whom he loves.
[18:33] No, but in this day God
[18:37] display if you say nothing shall be
[18:42] impossible unto
[18:45] you. New things, new things are being
[18:51] declared. I know very soon I'll be
[18:54] raptured out of you. The angel of God is

[20:10] [Music]
[20:26] unity. Amen.
[20:28] Hallelujah. Amen. Everybody feeling good
[20:30] in the house of the Lord? Let's give the
[20:32] Lord a good anchor of praise. Amen. He's
[20:34] worthy to be praised. Amen. and greet
[20:37] everyone in the mighty name of our Lord
[20:39] and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Our soon
[20:42] coming King. Amen. How many of you know
[20:44] he's much closer than he was yesterday.
[20:48] Hallelujah. Amen. And we are looking
[20:50] forward to see the King of Kings and the
[20:52] Lord of Lords. Many people are just
[20:54] satisfied with the word coming. But oh,
[20:56] I want to see him just to look upon his
[21:00] face.
[21:01] So, we want to wish all our mothers, our
[21:03] beautiful mothers, a happy Mother's Day.
[21:06] Amen. If you're sitting next to a
[21:08] mother, greet them and say, "You're
[21:09] looking good this
[21:12] morning." Amen. We thank God for our
[21:15] godly mothers. Amen. For all the love,
[21:17] the sacrifice. Amen. The labors of love
[21:22] uh to correct a child is not easy. Amen.
[21:25] And they say you will never know. Amen.
[21:28] What a mother's love is till you're
[21:30] going through something. Because a
[21:31] mother's love is unconditional. Yes. No
[21:34] matter what kind of a criminal that
[21:36] person is, how many convictions he's
[21:38] got, Amen. A mother's love always
[21:40] reaches out. Amen. Is the love of
[21:42] forgiveness.
[21:44] So that's the closest in the human
[21:46] element we experience to God's love. And
[21:49] that attribute is coming from God. A
[21:52] mother's love is an attribute of God's
[21:54] love. Amen. But God's love is greater.
[21:57] Amen. God's love is far more reaching.
[22:00] Hallelujah. So we are thankful. Amen.
[22:02] So, amen. We'll turn to our Bibles this
[22:04] morning. I pray, Amen, that all of you
[22:06] will have a blessed day. All our moms
[22:07] will have a blessed
[22:11] day. It says in verse 7, "Let us be glad
[22:14] and rejoice and give honor to him, for
[22:17] the marriage of the lamb is come, and
[22:19] his wife hath made herself ready." Amen.
[22:23] Amen. Hallelujah. So, this bride of
[22:25] Jesus Christ is a married wife. Amen.
[22:28] Hallelujah. How did she get ready? She
[22:30] was given the word to clothe herself.
[22:32] Like Rebecca was given the garments to
[22:34] go and meet Isaac. The bride has been
[22:36] given the word since 1963 to adorn
[22:39] herself. Amen. And get ready. Amen.
[22:42] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So, I'm
[22:45] showing you one woman here. Amen. And
[22:47] then we'll go to Revelation chapter
[22:57] 17. Revelation chapter 17. And there
[23:00] came one of the seven angels that which
[23:03] had the seven vials and talked to me,
[23:05] saying, "Come either, I will show thee
[23:07] the judgment of the great that
[23:09] siteth upon many waters." Now remember,
[23:11] it's the same angel that comes and says,
[23:12] "Behold, I will show you the lamb's
[23:14] wife." So this seventh angel with a vial
[23:17] in his hand. Now remember the prophet,
[23:19] he's taking a rock and he throws it up
[23:21] in the air. Amen. If you go and read
[23:24] what the seventh angel did when he
[23:25] poured his vial out, he threw it up into
[23:27] the air. So the prophet of God when he's
[23:30] there in the Amen. out there in the
[23:31] wilderness, he takes a rock and he
[23:33] throws it up in the air and he tells
[23:35] them to get undercover. Amen. Praise the
[23:38] Lord. So I'm tying that up to show you
[23:40] that this particular angel is showing
[23:42] you two women. Amen. One is showing you
[23:45] the lamb's wife, and this one is saying,
[23:47] "I'm going to show you the with
[23:49] whom the kings of the earth have
[23:51] committed fornication,
[23:53] and inhabitants of the earth have been
[23:55] made drunk with the wine of her
[23:56] fornication." Now, this woman, because
[23:59] she was committing fornication, she
[24:00] conceived,
[24:03] and she bear harlot daughters. Amen.
[24:06] Hallelujah. Amen.
[24:08] So he carried me away in the spirit into
[24:11] the wilderness and I saw a woman sit
[24:12] upon this scarlet colored beast full of
[24:15] names of blasphemy having seven heads
[24:17] and 10 horns. And the woman was arrayed
[24:19] in purple and scarlet color and was and
[24:22] decked with gold and precious stones and
[24:24] pearls, having a golden cup in her hand
[24:28] full of abomination and the filthiness
[24:30] of a fornication. And upon her forehead
[24:32] was a name written, Mystery Babylon the
[24:35] Great, the mother of harlots and
[24:37] abominations of the earth. And I saw the
[24:40] woman drunken with the blood of the
[24:41] saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[24:43] of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered
[24:46] with great
[24:47] admiration. And the angel said unto me,
[24:50] Wherefore dust thou marvel? I will tell
[24:52] thee the mystery of the woman and the of
[24:54] the beast that carried her, which had
[24:56] seven heads and 10 horns. Amen. Amen.
[25:00] and the Lord blessings through the
[25:01] reading of his word. You may be
[25:03] seated. Glory be to his name. Amen. I'll
[25:06] continue reading just so you get
[25:07] context. So he's telling him, "The beast
[25:09] that thou sawest and is not shall ascend
[25:12] out of the bottomless pit and go into
[25:14] pition and they that dwell on the earth
[25:16] shall wonder whose names were not
[25:18] written in the book of life from the
[25:20] foundation of the world." Now we can
[25:23] rest assured that our names were written
[25:24] in the lamb's book of life. So we are
[25:26] not part of this class of people.
[25:29] Amen.
[25:31] When they beheld, behold the beast that
[25:33] was and is not and yet is. Amen. And
[25:36] here is the mind that had wisdom. The
[25:38] seven heads are the seven mountains on
[25:40] which the woman siteth. Amen. Praise the
[25:42] Lord. There are seven kings. Five are
[25:44] fallen. One is one is not yet come. And
[25:47] when he cometh, he must continue a short
[25:50] space. Amen.
[25:53] And the beast that was and is not even
[25:55] is the eighth and is of the seven and
[25:57] goeth into pition. So you can continue
[25:59] reading to see who this beast is.
[26:02] Now you know that everyone is a buzz
[26:06] this week. Amen. Because they elected a
[26:08] new pope. Hallelujah.
[26:11] Amen. Is anyone not aware that they have
[26:13] elected a new pope? I'm sure everyone is
[26:16] aware. Amen.
[26:19] And a few weeks ago we were telling you
[26:21] that how even within the framework of
[26:23] the Vatican City where they they uh
[26:28] acknowledge their past popes, they've
[26:30] only got one position
[26:33] left, one slot left for the last pope.
[26:36] And that goes back to I think it's a
[26:38] 1700 prophecy or something of St.
[26:40] Malachi where he he detailed the popes
[26:43] that would come and he said when this
[26:44] one comes he will be the last pope.
[26:48] Right? So then you would you know the
[26:51] the prophet was was preaching he's
[26:54] preaching in this message acts of the
[26:56] holy ghost and while he's preaching now
[26:58] I don't want you to lose the context of
[27:00] what he is saying his point when he's
[27:03] preaching acts of the holy ghost there
[27:05] and he's speaking he is not his
[27:07] highlight is not regarding the Catholic
[27:10] church if you follow the quote you'll
[27:13] see what his point is. Amen. Praise the
[27:16] Lord. It's very important to have
[27:19] context because 1954 was not
[27:24] prophecy. Hallelujah.
[27:26] How many of you know that? Amen. It's
[27:30] not a prophecy. He is referencing a
[27:32] prophecy. Amen.
[27:35] Hallelujah.
[27:37] So when he when he's preaching this
[27:40] thing, Amen. When he's preaching it,
[27:42] he's referencing 1950. He's referencing
[27:45] a previous prophecy. If you can put up
[27:47] the quote there. So, the title of my
[27:49] message this morning is Happy Mother's
[27:52] Day to the wife of the Lord Jesus
[27:54] Christ.
[27:57] Amen. Happy Mother's Day to the wife of
[28:00] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[28:03] Amen. So, which means if you're the
[28:06] wife, the only way you can be mother is
[28:09] you must produce his life.
[28:12] So if you haven't produced his life,
[28:14] then you are barren and unfruitful. Like
[28:16] Peter says, if we don't have these
[28:19] things, we will be barren and
[28:21] unfruitful. So my point to show you,
[28:23] Amen, that there are two women on the
[28:25] earth
[28:27] today. Both receiving
[28:30] seed.
[28:32] Amen. Both seeds will produce an image.
[28:36] One an image unto the beast and one in
[28:39] the image of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[28:40] Amen. Yes. But both women must
[28:43] reproduce. Yes. One will take the seal
[28:46] of God. One will take the mark of the
[28:49] beast. Amen.
[28:52] Amen. This is not the time where the
[28:54] bride is being
[28:56] espoused. In fact, if you if you're a
[28:58] virgin bride, there's something wrong.
[29:00] Praise the Lord. Now, let's get back to
[29:02] this point. Now, here the prophet is is
[29:05] speaking a message and he's talking
[29:07] about the church coming into unity.
[29:10] Right? Then he starts with the thought
[29:13] of how they brought stones from around
[29:15] the world. Cut stones to build the
[29:19] temple in Solomon's time. I'm trying to
[29:22] give you the context of how the prophet
[29:23] comes about to tell you there will be a
[29:25] pope come from the United States. Okay?
[29:28] It's very important. In fact, that is a
[29:30] minor part of what he said. The pope
[29:31] coming from the United
[29:33] States. The more attractive part is what
[29:35] he says after
[29:37] that. Amen. So he says when they went to
[29:40] building Solomon's temple, the stones
[29:42] were cut out from one place and another
[29:45] place and another place. Some of them
[29:47] was cut this way, some of them that way.
[29:50] But the Bible says when they come
[29:51] together, it took 40 years, I believe,
[29:54] to erect the temple. Amen. Now, we've
[29:56] been speaking on 40 years, right?
[29:58] I'm telling you, in the 41st year,
[30:00] something happens. We've always been
[30:03] speaking as well after 25 years.
[30:06] We started out this year speaking after
[30:08] 25 years. We said could this be the time
[30:10] now after 25 years like Abraham where
[30:13] you'll produce the promised son the life
[30:15] of Jesus Christ. We spoke on opening up
[30:18] of dimensional doors. And I'm going to
[30:20] show you the door was open to you.
[30:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. So he's saying
[30:26] but the Bible says they would come
[30:28] together. It taken 40 years I believe to
[30:30] wreck the temple. There wasn't a buzz of
[30:32] a saw. So in silence, under the silence
[30:35] of that seventh seal, a bride was being
[30:38] formed.
[30:42] He says in
[30:43] silence, Amen. wasn't a buzz of a saw,
[30:47] sound of a hammer. In 40 years, the
[30:50] stones going together, stone on stone,
[30:52] only thing they had to do is smear a
[30:54] little mortar across it and set it down
[30:56] there. And it stuck. Stone by stone,
[30:59] stone by stone. Think of it. And here is
[31:01] my idea of it,
[31:03] brethren. That temple there represented
[31:06] the temple spir. Amen. The temple
[31:08] spiritual the temple that we are in now.
[31:12] So he's saying Solomon's temple
[31:13] represents our temple. Know we not you
[31:16] are the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[31:19] Amen. Amen. When you finally get the
[31:21] thought, you'll see how beautiful this
[31:22] is. So they came into the temple for
[31:25] their blessing.
[31:29] So, how are all the nations of the earth
[31:30] being blessed now? Through whom? Through
[31:33] this temple.
[31:36] We are baptized into the temple of God,
[31:38] into the body of God, into the body of
[31:41] Jesus Christ, and we're in Christ by
[31:43] Holy Spirit baptism.
[31:46] 1 Corinthians 12, therefore there is now
[31:49] no condemnation to them that are in
[31:51] Christ Jesus. Romans 8:1, that walk not
[31:53] after the flesh, but after the spirit.
[31:55] They desire spiritual things. They don't
[31:58] care about fleshly things. My flesh says
[32:00] I'm too tired. My spirit says you're
[32:02] not.
[32:04] I'm your boss. Follow me. So, who's
[32:07] ruling us? The spirit man. When the
[32:10] flesh says you're too tired to come to
[32:11] church, the spirit man must say, "I am
[32:13] your boss." You wake up and you come to
[32:15] church.
[32:19] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[32:21] see a case out there and the doctor
[32:23] says, you know, that case can't get
[32:25] well. That case is gone. I look at her
[32:28] and I'll say, "That's right." But the
[32:29] Holy Ghost comes and gives a vision,
[32:31] it's going to get well. Then I say,
[32:33] "Thus sayeth the Lord, that man will
[32:35] live." Right? So, we don't walk after
[32:38] the flesh. Amen. No more. We walk after
[32:41] the things of the spirit. I'm taking
[32:43] time to read it and give you the context
[32:45] now.
[32:46] Now when these stones come together they
[32:49] were cut out all over the world in
[32:51] different places. The wood hauled down
[32:53] from their tall cedars. Lebanon was cut
[32:56] brought to Jopa by oxc cut and so forth
[32:59] till they come to the temple. I want you
[33:01] to notice one stone was cut this way
[33:03] perhaps another stone cut another way.
[33:05] Perhaps when the masons were cutting
[33:07] them they might have argued and fussed
[33:09] and everything else like a bunch of
[33:11] preachers does today. Now watch here.
[33:13] He's getting to the point. I'm
[33:15] Methodist. I'm church of God. Glory to
[33:18] God. I belong to assemblies. You keep
[33:20] fussing. But remember it. God is is the
[33:23] one that's doing the cutting.
[33:26] And when this cuts this way and that
[33:28] way, they couldn't understand. But when
[33:30] they went to put it together, the whole
[33:33] thing was laying on the ground and they
[33:35] put it block on block and didn't have to
[33:37] cut no more. Right? Here's the point.
[33:40] Let's get to the quote. Now, the main
[33:41] quote, everyone was flashing everyone.
[33:43] Right? So what is his point? Everyone is
[33:46] divided.
[33:49] It looks like the stone is not cut
[33:50] properly.
[33:52] But when he's brought together, you're
[33:54] going to find he's going to put stone on
[33:56] stone, stone on stone, stone on stone.
[33:59] All right. Now, watch what how he's
[34:01] going to tell you what's going to bring
[34:03] the people together is the point of what
[34:04] he's trying to say. Amen. Now he goes to
[34:07] say, I believe one of these glorious
[34:09] days when this United Confederation of
[34:12] Church goes together
[34:14] and the new pope is brought out of the
[34:16] United States and put over there
[34:18] according to prophecy. So this is not
[34:20] his point. He's saying I believe that
[34:23] when this happens,
[34:25] confederation of churches, pope is
[34:27] brought out of United
[34:29] States, right?
[34:32] Then they'll form an image like unto the
[34:34] beast. Amen.
[34:37] And I tell you, the true church of God
[34:40] will be drove together. That's right.
[34:43] That's the point.
[34:45] Amen.
[34:47] Everyone's focusing on the pope. But the
[34:50] context of the quote is that when the
[34:53] when the confederation of churches get
[34:55] together and the pope is brought out of
[34:56] the United States, he says the church
[34:58] will be drove together.
[35:03] I know there's only one thing the
[35:06] prophet says in the rapture message will
[35:08] drive the church together and that's the
[35:10] power of the shout.
[35:16] So he is saying watch you've seen one
[35:18] effect of the shout call you out of your
[35:21] denominations call you out of your
[35:23] religions but he says watch when this
[35:25] happens the shout still continues and
[35:28] the people will be driven together
[35:37] continues now the real true believers of
[35:40] Methodist Baptist Presbyterians,
[35:42] Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim,
[35:44] Holiness, wherever they'll be will go
[35:46] together, cemented by the love of God
[35:49] that will make the body of the Lord
[35:50] Jesus Christ all believers.
[35:54] And agnostics and shallow-minded will be
[35:56] cast to one side. They'll go right to
[35:59] the confederation of churches. So, what
[36:00] are we looking for?
[36:02] They got their superman. But we are
[36:05] looking to the promise of now the church
[36:07] coming together.
[36:09] The bride of Christ coming together.
[36:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. So everyone now
[36:15] understand the context of the quote. The
[36:17] quote when he's preach he's preaching
[36:19] about the stones coming together. And
[36:21] he's saying it'll take this
[36:23] event confederation of
[36:26] churches to d amen. Elect the pope, set
[36:30] up the image of the
[36:31] beast, and let them all drive together,
[36:34] the true church of God. Amen. Praise the
[36:37] Lord. When he's saying when the
[36:39] confederation of churches get
[36:42] together, we know it started in the time
[36:44] of the prophet, but they actually signed
[36:47] the final peace agreement in
[36:49] 2023, right? So from 2023, they were
[36:53] getting together to 2025. the United
[36:57] Confederation of Churches getting
[36:59] together from 2023 to
[37:03] 2025. Right? Pay attention there. And
[37:06] brings about the new pope from the
[37:07] United States of America. He says, "Then
[37:10] they'll form an image unto the
[37:14] beast." Right? Now, it's important to
[37:17] ask yourself, how will the image be
[37:20] formed? Right? But let's deal with the
[37:22] second part. So, we dealt with 2023 to
[37:24] 2025. The Confederation of Churches got
[37:27] together. They signed the final
[37:29] document. I'm dealing with United
[37:32] Confederation of Churches. I'm telling
[37:33] you, it was signed in
[37:35] 2023. Final document. You won't find
[37:38] World Religions meeting again. They've
[37:39] already
[37:40] united. Pope Francis did that. Pope
[37:43] Francis is the one that elected this
[37:45] pope now into a cardinal. In 2023, he
[37:49] made him a cardinal.
[37:51] Amen. Hallelujah.
[37:55] Right. The new pope is brought out of
[37:58] the United States. When is that
[38:01] happened?
[38:02] 2025. It actually happened on the 8th
[38:05] day of
[38:06] May. It happened on the 8th
[38:09] day of
[38:12] May. Amen. Praise the Lord. And put over
[38:15] there according to prophecy. Now most
[38:17] people asking the question, where's the
[38:19] prophecy?
[38:22] This is not the
[38:23] prophecy. This is referencing the
[38:25] prophecy.
[38:30] Prophecy must have thus said the Lord.
[38:34] Now, nobody can find the
[38:37] prophecy. So, you're getting all the uh
[38:41] skeptics, right, rising up and saying,
[38:44] "Brother Brandon never prophesied here."
[38:47] He's referencing a prophecy. I say, "Why
[38:50] does it matter? It came to pass
[38:52] anyway." Number one,
[38:55] right? That's just to brush them off.
[38:59] Whether he prophesied or somebody else
[39:00] prophesied, it came to pass. Am I right?
[39:03] Secondly, they come around to the
[39:05] question, is this the pope from the
[39:07] United
[39:08] States? Meaning, they're expecting more
[39:10] popes from the United States. People
[39:11] always want more time.
[39:15] So they're saying, "Yes, maybe this pope
[39:17] came from the United States, but this
[39:19] maybe not the one to drive everyone
[39:20] together." You see how people's minds
[39:22] work. They're saying there could be
[39:24] several other popes come out. How do we
[39:26] know this is the one who comes out from
[39:28] the United States will be at the end
[39:31] time? Hallelujah.
[39:34] Right? Put over there according to
[39:36] prophecy. Then they'll form an image
[39:38] like unto the beast.
[39:41] Now I'm going to give you my
[39:43] understanding of it. When I'm saying my
[39:46] understanding, I am saying my
[39:47] understanding as a student of the
[39:49] word. You don't have to take
[39:52] it. But I'm going to show you the
[39:56] prophecy. Amen. How many of you want to
[39:58] see the
[40:00] prophecy? But you got to I said you
[40:03] don't have to believe it. You got to
[40:05] have an open mind though, right?
[40:10] You got the other quote. I think it was
[40:11] after that I sent it to you. It was one
[40:14] quote after
[40:15] that. He says, "Then in the sixth
[40:17] vision, this is now his
[40:20] prophecies. There rose up in America a
[40:23] most beautiful but cruel
[40:26] woman. She held the people in a complete
[40:30] power." Now I know all of your minds are
[40:32] going to when Kamala stood there on the
[40:34] stage in purple. I ask you when did she
[40:36] hold the world in complete
[40:38] power? Did Camala hold the world in
[40:41] complete power? She couldn't even hold
[40:43] the Democrats
[40:44] together. Okay, let's backtrack. The
[40:47] prophet had seven major visions. Seven
[40:50] major visions. He said before the Lord
[40:51] comes back to the earth to take the
[40:53] people away, right? And he said five of
[40:56] them have been fulfilled. And he was
[40:58] always talking about the sixth one
[41:00] because in his day this had not been
[41:01] fulfilled yet. Okay, everyone on track
[41:04] now because some people are looking at
[41:06] me like they they need revision. Amen.
[41:08] Revision classes. So the prophet had
[41:11] seven major visions and these are
[41:14] prophecies. Some of you are familiar
[41:16] with them. You saw the X-shaped car. He
[41:18] saw the the world wars. Amen. How many
[41:21] of you your memories being joged now? He
[41:23] had these seven major visions. The last
[41:25] and final one he saw America go up in a
[41:27] great ball of smoke. Do everyone
[41:29] understand these visions? These are
[41:31] prophecies.
[41:34] So I am saying as a private student this
[41:37] is the prophecy he's referring
[41:41] to right because he saw this woman rise
[41:46] up in the United States and she held
[41:49] complete power but watch what he says
[41:51] next now he says there in the sixth
[41:54] vision arose in America a most beautiful
[41:57] but cruel woman she held the people in a
[41:59] complete power I say that's not Kamala
[42:02] Again, tell your neighbor that's not
[42:04] Camala. I believe that this was the rise
[42:06] of the Roman Catholic Church. Now, who's
[42:09] saying he believes
[42:10] this? Hello. Come on, somebody walk with
[42:12] me. Who is speaking here? So, how come
[42:14] you believe something
[42:17] different? You going telling everyone it
[42:19] was fulfilled by Kamala, but your
[42:21] prophet is saying, "I believe something
[42:22] else." So, which means you and the
[42:24] prophet don't believe the same
[42:27] thing. Turn to your neighbor, say,
[42:29] "Believe what the prophet said.
[42:34] Come on now. So all the people you told
[42:37] it was Kamala, you need to go phone them
[42:38] and say it wasn't
[42:41] Kamala. Am I right? What is our prophet
[42:44] saying? I believe I is a personal
[42:47] pronoun that this was the rise of the
[42:50] Roman Catholic
[42:51] Church though it could possibly be a
[42:54] vision of some woman rising in great
[42:56] power in America due to a popular vote
[42:59] by women.
[43:01] Right? But what is the prophet saying he
[43:04] believes it? It's the rise of the
[43:05] Catholic Church. There's only one woman
[43:08] who will rise up. We read about this
[43:09] woman in Revelation 17 will hold the
[43:12] world in a complete
[43:13] power. Now, there's a pope, if you go
[43:16] back to the other quote, a pope risen up
[43:19] from America. And watch what watch how
[43:21] he says it now when you reread it. Amen.
[43:25] The pope is rising out of where? and put
[43:29] over there. Hey, come on. Amen.
[43:35] In the sixth vision, he's saying he saw
[43:36] the woman rise up in the United States.
[43:39] Here, when he's referencing the vision,
[43:41] the vision, by the way, was
[43:43] 1933. Here it's
[43:45] 1954. When he's referencing the vision,
[43:48] he's saying the pope will be taken out
[43:50] of the United States and put over
[43:55] there. Another point to mention, this
[43:58] pope comes from
[44:00] Chicago. Chicago is where they held a
[44:03] Christian businessman's fellowship when
[44:05] 300 ministers got together to challenge
[44:07] the prophet on his
[44:12] doctrine.
[44:13] Amen. So the Har daughters rose up to
[44:17] question the prophet on his doctrine in
[44:19] Chicago. Now there comes a pope out of
[44:23] Chicago. Amen.
[44:26] Then a point to observe is he he's taken
[44:29] on the name of Leo. The proverb said
[44:33] Jesus first coming was under the sign of
[44:36] Virgo and his last sign when he comes
[44:39] again is coming under the sign of Leo
[44:42] because he's coming back as the lion of
[44:44] the tribe of Judah. So if Christ himself
[44:48] is coming back as a lion, what do you
[44:50] think the antichrist is going to take a
[44:52] name as?
[44:56] as Leo the lion
[44:59] because he's
[45:01] antichrist. So he's assume he could have
[45:03] assumed many other names of different
[45:06] popes but he's assuming the name of Leo
[45:09] because Christ is coming back as the
[45:10] lion of the tribe of Judah and the
[45:12] antichrist spirit must come to counter
[45:15] that.
[45:17] Hallelujah.
[45:19] Praise the Lord. So watch now you're
[45:22] seeing there United Confederation of
[45:24] Churches I showed you completed 2023 new
[45:27] pope coming out of the United States put
[45:29] over there
[45:31] 2025 right then they'll form an image
[45:35] like unto the
[45:37] beast hallelujah praise the lord amen
[45:42] praise the
[45:43] lord so they will form an image unto the
[45:46] beast which is a one world religion and
[45:48] try to unite the world in peace
[45:50] You say why? He's the same Christ
[45:52] yesterday, today, and forever. His
[45:54] powers cannot fail because he's God.
[45:56] God's divine order of the earth. The
[45:59] Holy Spirit today is the same as he was.
[46:02] To reject Jehovah had a penalty. Follow
[46:06] his thought now.
[46:08] Right? To reject Jesus had a penalty.
[46:12] And to reject this, which is the Holy
[46:14] Ghost, people call it foolishness. Is
[46:16] the Holy Ghost. to speak a word against
[46:19] it will never be forgiven in this world
[46:21] to come. This in this world or the world
[46:23] to come. It's more of a penalty to
[46:26] reject the Holy Spirit today than it
[46:28] would be to reject Jesus or the
[46:32] father. Right? Remember, we're dealing
[46:35] with that third part now. Forming an
[46:36] image unto the beast, the mark of the
[46:39] beast. So, I'm taking you through a
[46:41] series of quotes now to show you how
[46:42] that will happen. Pay attention. Right?
[46:45] Then the next
[46:47] quote. So these two women now producing
[46:50] children, one will take the seal of God,
[46:52] one will take the mark of the beast. So
[46:54] the prophet is
[46:56] saying,
[46:57] Amen. I think the seal of God is the
[47:00] Holy
[47:02] Spirit. The Bible supports that the mark
[47:05] of the beast is to reject the Holy
[47:08] Spirit. So how you get the mark of the
[47:11] beast? Reject the Holy Spirit.
[47:18] Amen. How do you get the seal of God? To
[47:21] receive the Holy Spirit. So the one who
[47:24] receives the Holy Spirit is receiving
[47:26] the seal of God. The one who rejects the
[47:29] Holy Spirit is getting the mark of the
[47:31] beast.
[47:35] Maybe maybe it didn't click yet. If you
[47:38] receive the message for your day, if you
[47:40] receive this message, you're receiving
[47:42] the seal of God because this is the Holy
[47:44] Ghost. But to reject this
[47:47] message, to turn this message down, to
[47:50] speak against this prophet, and to speak
[47:53] against this bride is to receive the
[47:55] mark of the beast.
[48:00] Praise the
[48:01] Lord. I hope this is okay. I'm speaking
[48:03] on happy Mother's Day to the wife of the
[48:06] Lord Jesus Christ. Or I can say happy
[48:08] Mother's Day to Mrs. Jesus Christ. Amen.
[48:12] Maybe you're sitting here and you're
[48:13] thinking, "Hey, I don't have a
[48:14] child." Well, the Holy Ghost is still
[48:16] available now. Say, "Birth me, Lord.
[48:19] Birth me this morning." Maybe you're
[48:22] still identifying yourself as bride,
[48:24] virgin bride, pure, untouched. Jesus
[48:26] wants to touch you.
[48:32] You're going around. I'm a virgin man
[48:33] untouched by no
[48:35] man. Jesus wants to touch
[48:38] you. Praise the
[48:40] Lord. Amen. Praise the
[48:46] Lord. So one is coming into union with
[48:50] Jesus Christ. One is coming under the
[48:52] union of Federation of Churches. Roman
[48:55] Catholic Church will also produce have
[48:57] already produced our daughters. Because
[48:59] you read there in Revelation 17, she
[49:01] committed fornications with many men.
[49:04] For she was producing many daughters,
[49:07] many har daughters. Amen. We can't
[49:09] receive seed
[49:11] word. Let's follow the thought in the
[49:17] message all things. He says, notice so
[49:21] to reject the Holy Spirit, they accepted
[49:23] the formal side of it. Have a form of
[49:26] godliness, denying the power thereof.
[49:28] Now, here's the Catholic Church. He's
[49:30] showing you now the Catholic Church
[49:31] here. They reject the Holy Spirit to
[49:34] receive a creed,
[49:37] right? They repeat all kinds of apostle
[49:39] creeds and everything like that with a
[49:42] lot of word mixed into it. In fact, when
[49:44] you spoke speak his first few speeches,
[49:47] he sounds so religious. He's quoting
[49:49] Jesus words. He's quoting everything of
[49:52] the Bible. But he's saying they have a
[49:54] lot of word mixed into it.
[49:59] So don't get deceived by that, right?
[50:02] They repeat all kinds of apostle creeds,
[50:04] everything like that, but a lot of word
[50:05] mixed into it and a lot that's not word,
[50:09] right? Because Hail Marys and all of
[50:10] these
[50:11] things.
[50:14] Amen. And then they the word of God, I
[50:17] mean, then they do all things and yet it
[50:19] goes through a formal ritualistic
[50:21] affair. There's no power to it. It's
[50:23] dead.
[50:25] It's just a hull like like that girl's
[50:28] body, the life was gone out of it. It
[50:30] was no good. Nobody wanted it. The life
[50:32] was gone. It's the life that means
[50:34] something. No matter how much you
[50:36] accumulate in this world, how many
[50:38] churches you belong to? What about that
[50:41] soul of yours? What about the life
[50:43] that's in you? Is it right with God?
[50:47] And it can only be right by accepting
[50:49] that great preparation that God made to
[50:52] bring human being across the chasm to
[50:54] himself. That's the blood of Jesus
[50:56] Christ. So I'm saying if you haven't
[50:57] received the blood for forgiveness of
[50:59] sins, you still have a chance this
[51:01] morning. If you're holding on to past
[51:04] sins and and sins are, Amen. You're
[51:05] still caught up in things of this world.
[51:07] The Holy Ghost is here this morning.
[51:09] Amen. The blood of Jesus Christ is here
[51:11] this morning. We can't be looking at all
[51:13] of these external signs and still be in
[51:16] sin and still be wondering, "Oh, maybe
[51:19] maybe there's still more time for me."
[51:21] No. Why don't we quit our nonsense?
[51:23] Amen. If you can see the flashing red
[51:25] light of his coming, he says, "Throw
[51:27] away the peanuts." Amen. He says, "Make
[51:30] sure you got your ticket in your hand,
[51:31] which is the Holy Ghost." And he says,
[51:33] "Stand there getting ready and board
[51:36] that train when it stops."
[51:39] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[51:47] Now there's a thing that people are m
[51:49] materialistically
[51:52] minded. They're after they're after
[51:55] materialistic things in this life. How
[51:58] much they can accumulate, how much they
[52:00] can get. Let's be spiritually minded.
[52:03] Let's be heavenly minded and see how
[52:06] much of the word we can take, how much
[52:08] of the word we can reproduce.
[52:13] Amen. You know, there was something
[52:15] about Rachel and Leah and those other
[52:18] servants. They always wanted to see how
[52:20] much more life they could reproduce of
[52:23] Jacob. When God shut their womb, they
[52:25] went to pray, "Lord, open my womb." If
[52:27] their home was shut, they gave the maid.
[52:30] So, I'm saying, why can't we be like
[52:31] that? See how much of the life of God we
[52:33] can
[52:35] reproduce. Don't be happy with one
[52:38] stalk. Amen.
[52:41] Don't be happy with one virtue. Oh, I've
[52:43] got faith. I've got faith. I've got
[52:44] faith. But he says add to your faith.
[52:50] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the
[52:52] Lord. So the blood is still here. He
[52:55] says no creed will bridge the way. No
[52:58] denomination will do it. No education,
[53:00] no scientist, nothing else but the blood
[53:02] of Jesus Christ is the only thing that
[53:04] will bridge it. The next quote in the
[53:06] token, I've got two more quotes here on
[53:08] this part here. He says, "What about the
[53:10] mark of the beast?" He says, "Those who
[53:12] reject the Holy Spirit is already marked
[53:15] by the beast." So, people are looking
[53:18] for a chip to be put. People are looking
[53:20] for a mark to be put on their forehead,
[53:22] a mark to be put on their hand. Even
[53:25] now, they're telling you about a a a
[53:26] rice size uh
[53:29] chip, a grain that can be inserted here
[53:32] where you can transact. The prophet is
[53:34] saying, "Don't look for those things. To
[53:36] reject the Holy Ghost is to re is to
[53:39] receive the mark of the beast. And I
[53:41] said that's the message of the hour.
[53:46] Amen. His final one in 1963, he's
[53:49] preaching on pardon. He says, "You must
[53:52] reject." Amen. To do this, you've got to
[53:55] reject the Holy Spirit. And he's
[53:57] performing power to accept a creed. You
[53:59] have to see the truth before you can
[54:01] accept an error. If you're going to be a
[54:03] Christian, you have to walk over God's
[54:05] promise in order to get an error because
[54:07] there's a red light flashing before you
[54:09] all the time. This is the word. So, what
[54:12] did Abel do? What did Cain have to do?
[54:14] Walk over Abel's truth. When he had a
[54:18] conversation with Cain, he was revealing
[54:20] to him how come his sacrifice was
[54:23] accepted. Amen. Everyone remember
[54:25] that. And because of Abel's revelation,
[54:28] Cain got angry. He had to walk over the
[54:30] truth and he killed his
[54:32] brother. So that's what they're doing
[54:34] now. You go present in your best way of
[54:37] presentation this word to somebody and
[54:40] you'll see how they will reject it. So
[54:42] they have got to reject truth first
[54:44] before they accept their
[54:46] error because I've even heard it in my
[54:48] own years where they tell us where you
[54:50] show them in the Bible baptism in the
[54:52] name of the Lord Jesus
[54:53] Christ. You show them amen. got it in
[54:57] the Bible. They will tell you, "But our
[54:59] church, our Bible college, our seminary
[55:03] teaches it this way." So they are
[55:06] rejecting truth to accept a man-made
[55:09] creed. And that's
[55:11] sad.
[55:13] Amen.
[55:15] Hallelujah. You can put up those two
[55:17] pictures. Amen. That I sent you as
[55:20] well. You'll see this the one that was
[55:23] being Amen. I sent you two pictures
[55:24] there. You can put anyone up. The first
[55:27] one in that order. So this was Amen.
[55:30] where everyone is posting this thing
[55:32] prophecy
[55:33] fulfilled. Pope brought out of United
[55:36] States and put over
[55:37] there.
[55:39] Amen. The next one I I just want to show
[55:41] you this. This is part of his speech
[55:43] what he was saying here. Amen. I I'm
[55:47] trying I'm showing you this picture to
[55:48] show you what we just read. They have a
[55:50] whole lot of word but they put in their
[55:52] creeds. And see what he says here. As I
[55:54] begin my mission as bishop of Rome, may
[55:57] God grant me this grace today as always
[55:59] through the loving intercession of
[56:03] Mary, mother of the
[56:07] church. Mary is not the mother of the
[56:10] church. You see how they put their creed
[56:12] in there where in the Bible it says,
[56:14] "Hail Mary, mother of the
[56:17] church." Amen. So you see a lot of it is
[56:21] sounding good but they have their own
[56:23] creeds inserted into the
[56:25] word mother of the church. They again
[56:28] show they are showing you that Mary is
[56:30] the mother of their church and they are
[56:33] saying Mary got children. Amen. Praise
[56:36] the
[56:38] Lord.
[56:45] Hallelujah. Now remember what we were
[56:46] saying on on Wednesday. We said every
[56:49] generation must have a chance at the
[56:51] word. Each generation must have a
[56:53] revival. Amen. And I'm saying now is a
[56:56] time for our
[56:58] revival. While they are getting ready to
[57:01] form an image unto the
[57:03] beast. Amen. Which is a one world
[57:07] religion. We are forming ourselves into
[57:10] the image of Jesus
[57:11] Christ. Amen. We are being formed into
[57:14] the word image. Hallelujah. We are not
[57:17] partaking of man-made creeds. Amen. So I
[57:20] am saying as we examine our lives this
[57:22] morning, can we say that we have
[57:25] reproduced the life of the Lord Jesus
[57:28] Christ? Amen. Or are we finding
[57:31] ourselves as a barren and unfruitful
[57:35] woman? Amen. Praise the Lord.
[57:50] So I'm going to reiterate two women
[57:52] again. Amen. Two women again. One
[57:55] producing an image unto the beast. Both
[57:58] are
[57:58] mothers. One producing an image of the
[58:01] Lord Jesus Christ. Right now who is
[58:05] responsible for this? It's the work of
[58:08] the Holy Spirit.
[58:10] There's only one player. If you if
[58:12] you've been following the quotes, pay
[58:14] attention. I might close now. If you pay
[58:18] [Laughter]
[58:19] attention, there's one major player for
[58:23] both people to receive
[58:25] marks. So there's two things available.
[58:27] One is a seal, one is a mark. But one
[58:30] player, Holy
[58:32] Ghost. To receive the Holy Ghost, you
[58:35] get sealed. To reject the Holy Ghost,
[58:37] you get marked. Right? I'm speaking like
[58:40] this. So that even the children can
[58:41] understand. You take on the mark of the
[58:43] beast,
[58:45] right? So two players, two
[58:48] women, two
[58:51] children. Amen. Who is
[58:55] responsible. So when we are saying holy
[58:58] spirit, receive the holy spirit, receive
[59:00] the holy spirit, the holy spirit is
[59:02] speaking via the five-fold ministry.
[59:07] So, so maybe you're thinking, can I sit
[59:09] at home and come into the image of Jesus
[59:11] Christ?
[59:14] No. The prophet says you got to have a
[59:17] pastor, he says your pastor will see you
[59:19] through. Amen. If you put up Ephesians 4
[59:22] there, Amen. Hallelujah. Let's see who's
[59:26] responsible now to bring that image to
[59:29] the church. Amen. We can't go contrary.
[59:33] You know, people say they love the word,
[59:34] love the word, but they don't have a
[59:37] pastor.
[59:40] Hello.
[59:41] Yeah. Some of them come floating here
[59:44] too. They like uh got uh what can I say?
[59:49] You know when you got gym membership,
[59:51] you can go to any
[59:56] gym. Yeah. uh they have a problem
[59:59] submitting to a pastor and that is a
[1:00:02] spirit. How can we say we are submitting
[1:00:04] to Christ? They're saying they love the
[1:00:07] word. They love the word. They're in
[1:00:11] submission to Christ. But Christ is
[1:00:13] saying my order is the five-fold.
[1:00:18] So they are saying we are submitting to
[1:00:20] Christ. But Christ is saying but if you
[1:00:21] don't submit to the five-fold, you're
[1:00:23] not submitting to me.
[1:00:27] Right? So let's read how we are formed
[1:00:30] into this because let's get Bible.
[1:00:37] Right? Let's read from verse 8.
[1:00:40] Wherefore he said when he ascended up on
[1:00:42] high, he led captivity captive and he
[1:00:45] gave gifts unto men. Right? First point.
[1:00:48] Then he ascended. Okay, let's go now to
[1:00:51] verse 11. Let's get to verse 11. And he
[1:00:54] gave some apostles, some prophets, some
[1:00:57] evangelists, some pastors and teachers
[1:00:59] for what?
[1:01:01] Let's read now. How are you going to get
[1:01:03] perfected? For the perfecting of the
[1:01:06] saints. Let's read right. For the
[1:01:08] perfecting of
[1:01:10] the So you see why people are not
[1:01:12] getting perfected. They are not coming
[1:01:14] under the five-fold ministry. And even
[1:01:16] if they under the five-fold ministry,
[1:01:18] they always got a gripe with the pastor.
[1:01:21] They don't respect him. whatever he's
[1:01:23] teaching, they they they take what they
[1:01:25] want and they throw away the rest. But
[1:01:27] he says they are there for the
[1:01:28] perfecting of the
[1:01:30] saints, for the work of the ministry,
[1:01:33] for the edifying of the body of Christ.
[1:01:35] Now, here's the important part. Edifying
[1:01:37] of the body of Christ till we all come
[1:01:40] into unity of the faith. So when you
[1:01:43] under a pastor and he tells you don't
[1:01:45] join them, don't go to the convention,
[1:01:48] don't do this. How is he working for the
[1:01:50] unity of the saints?
[1:01:54] Hey, let's expose spirits.
[1:01:58] When he's saying we don't go there and
[1:02:00] we don't support this, that means he's
[1:02:02] building his own kingdom, his own
[1:02:03] empire, and he's not part of the kingdom
[1:02:05] of
[1:02:06] God. Because the kingdom of God says
[1:02:09] they this five-fold will work for the
[1:02:11] unity of the
[1:02:13] saints. They won't only come when it's
[1:02:16] their favorite
[1:02:18] preacher. When you get someone from the
[1:02:20] USA, hey, we got someone from
[1:02:23] America. Now we will go and support
[1:02:27] it. You get someone from Zimbabwe. Ah,
[1:02:31] we won't
[1:02:32] go. Even worse when it's a local
[1:02:34] minister's
[1:02:36] preaching, we hear them every week.
[1:02:38] Which means they are saying, we hear the
[1:02:39] Holy Ghost every week. He got nothing to
[1:02:41] tell
[1:02:43] me. You see, it's all about expectation.
[1:02:47] Like if you came with a need this
[1:02:48] morning and you asking the Holy Spirit,
[1:02:50] speak to me directly.
[1:02:53] Maybe some of you had questions
[1:02:54] regarding the prophecy. Maybe some of
[1:02:56] you had questions regarding the pope. I
[1:02:58] pray the Holy Ghost made it clear this
[1:02:59] morning.
[1:03:04] Amen. If they ask you where did he
[1:03:05] prophesy, you now can go and show the
[1:03:07] prophecy.
[1:03:09] Praise the Lord. Let's see now. Not only
[1:03:11] that, come into unity of faith and of
[1:03:13] the knowledge of the son of God unto a
[1:03:17] perfect
[1:03:18] man and to the measure of the stature of
[1:03:22] the fullness of Christ. Who is doing
[1:03:25] this? Through the five-fold, you are
[1:03:27] going to come into the stature of a
[1:03:29] perfect
[1:03:29] man. I'm not saying it. The Bible is
[1:03:32] saying
[1:03:33] it. No, but I can sit at home. No, you
[1:03:36] can't.
[1:03:39] The reason you want to sit at home, you
[1:03:40] want to keep your
[1:03:41] tithes. That's the bottom line. They're
[1:03:44] lying. They don't want to go to church.
[1:03:45] They're lying about they want to stay at
[1:03:48] home and press
[1:03:51] play. Their true motive is they want to
[1:03:53] keep their
[1:03:58] tides. Yeah, that's the truth. You may
[1:04:01] you're thinking it's carnal, but that's
[1:04:02] how carnal they are. I promise you they
[1:04:05] are not sitting and listening to that
[1:04:06] tape like you think they are. They got
[1:04:09] coffee in their
[1:04:11] hand. You know the first service they're
[1:04:13] there now they're
[1:04:16] listening. Second service they're more
[1:04:18] relaxed. Third service now it's gone
[1:04:21] months and years. Now they're probably
[1:04:23] having breakfast and listening to
[1:04:25] it. It's playing in the
[1:04:31] background. Hallelujah.
[1:04:34] Now remember what the prophet says that
[1:04:36] this image that's being formed unto the
[1:04:38] beast will one day close the
[1:04:41] churches.
[1:04:43] Right? So I'm asking you and I'm telling
[1:04:46] you that no sons of the prophet were
[1:04:48] ever used in the
[1:04:51] Bible. Go look at it and you come back
[1:04:55] next week and show me you you're wrong.
[1:04:56] Yeah. The sons of the prophet were used.
[1:04:59] Show me the sons of a major prophet were
[1:05:04] used. Go look at what happened to Eli's
[1:05:07] sons. Look at what happened to Samuel's
[1:05:10] sons. Amen. The sons of major prophets
[1:05:13] were never used. And what are the sons
[1:05:15] of the prophets
[1:05:17] saying? Close the five-fold
[1:05:23] down. But I thought the antichrist was
[1:05:25] supposed to do that. Close the churches.
[1:05:28] You can stay at home at 2 p.m. You can
[1:05:30] listen. We have a standard time around
[1:05:33] the world. You all, you see how it's a
[1:05:34] false unity at a specific time. We can
[1:05:38] all listen to the same
[1:05:41] message. It sounds
[1:05:43] nice, but the Bible is telling you
[1:05:46] there's a five-fold to bring you to the
[1:05:48] stature of a perfect
[1:05:49] man to come into the image. Amen. Full
[1:05:52] measure of the stature of fullness of
[1:05:54] Christ. So, whose word are we going to
[1:05:56] listen to?
[1:05:58] I am saying this now because some of you
[1:06:00] may get disgruntled in the future and
[1:06:02] the first thing you're going to think of
[1:06:03] I can stay at home and listen to tapes
[1:06:05] and still be a Christian. Prophet said
[1:06:07] you can't. He says God don't use
[1:06:10] mechanical devices.
[1:06:14] Amen.
[1:06:16] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:22] Amen. Amen. There's just so much to go
[1:06:25] on here. Amen. Maybe I'll end with
[1:06:29] this. We must be the kind of
[1:06:31] wife that reproduces the life of
[1:06:35] Christ.
[1:06:39] Amen. If by now we haven't taken
[1:06:42] conception of the word, if you if you're
[1:06:45] looking at Revelation, you can put it up
[1:06:47] there 108 from verse 8. What really is
[1:06:49] happening here is that this book is
[1:06:52] coming into a people.
[1:06:56] It's a word coming into a people. And in
[1:06:59] Luke chapter 8, he says, "My word is a
[1:07:04] seed." Right? So remember, it's the same
[1:07:07] book that that John couldn't take in
[1:07:10] Revelation 5. Now in Revelation 10,
[1:07:13] suddenly he can take the
[1:07:16] book. Right?
[1:07:20] So he's taking the book and then he's
[1:07:23] asked to take the book from the hand of
[1:07:25] the angel and eat the book. Eating is
[1:07:29] symbology, right? Like Eve ate in the
[1:07:32] garden of Eden. She didn't eat of a
[1:07:34] fruit like a apple or peach or
[1:07:39] apricot.
[1:07:40] Amen. She had a sexual affair with the
[1:07:45] serpent. So she ate. In the book of
[1:07:48] Proverbs, he says, "An adulterous woman
[1:07:51] eateth, wipes her mouth and say, I have
[1:07:54] done no
[1:07:55] wrong." Here again, John who is
[1:07:58] representing the wife of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:59] Christ is now eating the seed
[1:08:04] word. And the seed word when it gets
[1:08:06] into the into her, now let's move to the
[1:08:09] next verse.
[1:08:11] Amen. It'll make thy belly
[1:08:14] bitter. Right? But eating itself, he
[1:08:17] says, it'll be sweet in thy
[1:08:20] mouth.
[1:08:22] Amen. I I want you to read between the
[1:08:25] lines. Now, the act of eating, I defined
[1:08:28] what eating is so you can figure it out.
[1:08:31] The act of eating is very
[1:08:33] sweet, but when you conceive, hey,
[1:08:37] morning
[1:08:38] sickness, belly bitter
[1:08:42] now. Hey, come on. Somebody's catching
[1:08:44] this.
[1:08:46] What? You thought he was having sweet
[1:08:48] and
[1:08:51] sour? He wasn't having sweet and
[1:08:55] sour. Conception was taking
[1:08:58] place. While he was eating it, it was
[1:09:00] good to be in union receiving the seed
[1:09:04] word.
[1:09:05] But when he con when she conceived,
[1:09:08] bitter in the
[1:09:10] belly. Now there's a period of time now
[1:09:12] 9 months.
[1:09:16] Right? Then go back, go to next verse.
[1:09:20] So he goes and he does all of these
[1:09:21] things. And now in verse 11, when the
[1:09:25] child is conceived and brought forth in
[1:09:27] the image of Christ, thou must prophesy
[1:09:30] again.
[1:09:35] Amen. Who is this prophesying again?
[1:09:38] Jesus in bright form. Christ in bright
[1:09:41] form. Amen. Hallelujah. So, what kind of
[1:09:45] woman? Let's let's put it up there in in
[1:09:46] the rapture message. I'm going to close
[1:09:48] now. Yeah. What the prophet is saying in
[1:09:51] the rapture
[1:09:52] message, Jesus wants fruit. Now, he
[1:09:55] doesn't want
[1:09:56] apple. Jesus don't want pear. Tell your
[1:09:59] neighbor Jesus don't want apple and
[1:10:03] pear. Because some people, you know,
[1:10:05] they want to read the they want to read
[1:10:06] uh say I'm going to spend time and read.
[1:10:08] They'll read this one line and close the
[1:10:10] book. Yeah. I read the Bible today. They
[1:10:12] read the message. They say Jesus wants
[1:10:16] fruit. What kind of fruit? His wife must
[1:10:20] bring forth the kind of children that he
[1:10:24] is. I say again, stop telling me you're
[1:10:26] a virgin
[1:10:28] bride,
[1:10:33] untouched. This is the rapture message.
[1:10:36] It's 4th of December, just before he
[1:10:37] leaves the earth. He's saying Jesus
[1:10:40] wants fruit for
[1:10:43] himself. His wife must bring forth the
[1:10:45] kind of children that he is. What kind
[1:10:48] of children? Bride children. Word
[1:10:51] children. Amen. Anything else? He calls
[1:10:55] the denominational child. So he wants a
[1:10:57] bride in the image and likeness of his.
[1:10:59] The next quote there, the church is
[1:11:02] married to Christ. We are the wife of
[1:11:05] Christ bringing forth children.
[1:11:09] So notice now one message was second
[1:11:11] coming of Christ the other message was
[1:11:14] rapture and both he's telling you that
[1:11:16] this bride must reproduce his
[1:11:20] life and this has all started because a
[1:11:23] door was
[1:11:26] opened. Amen. A door being opened. Amen.
[1:11:30] We don't have time to go into it right
[1:11:32] now but word children bright children.
[1:11:35] So, you remember when I I really don't
[1:11:37] have time because I must close now. You
[1:11:39] remember when when they tried to trap
[1:11:41] Jesus and they brought a coin to him and
[1:11:44] they said, "Uh, must we pay tax to
[1:11:47] Caesar?" Jesus said, "Show me a coin."
[1:11:50] He says, "Whose inscription is on
[1:11:53] it? Whose image does it
[1:11:56] bear?" It bears Caesars. Then he says,
[1:11:58] "Give to Caesar what he Caesars's and
[1:12:01] unto God what is God's." So, I'm asking
[1:12:03] you, what image are you portraying
[1:12:05] today?
[1:12:07] Whose inscription is on you?
[1:12:12] Because that's going to show what seed
[1:12:14] you've been receiving.
[1:12:16] Whose inscription is on you? What image
[1:12:18] is on you? The image of the beast or the
[1:12:21] image of Jesus Christ? Two sons must be
[1:12:24] born. Now, you know why the prophet is
[1:12:27] saying when they can Amen. discern the
[1:12:29] two spirits working in the framework of
[1:12:31] the Christian church. She will be a
[1:12:33] super church, a super race and
[1:12:36] invincible army. Satan will be powerless
[1:12:38] before her.
[1:12:40] All because of the image coming now, the
[1:12:43] two sons being produced. One image of
[1:12:46] the beast, one image of the son of God.
[1:12:49] Amen. Mothers producing sons in the
[1:12:53] image of the father. That's your happy
[1:12:55] mother's day.
[1:12:59] We are producing sons. Two women
[1:13:02] producing sons in the image of their
[1:13:04] father. That's what's going on
[1:13:07] now. So yes, you can go wish everyone
[1:13:10] denominational world too. You can go
[1:13:11] wish Catholics happy mother's
[1:13:14] day because they are bearing the image
[1:13:16] of their father. What did Jesus tell
[1:13:18] them in I forget the book. I think it's
[1:13:20] Matthew 8 or it's either John. He says
[1:13:23] you are of your father. The
[1:13:25] who you of your father the devil and the
[1:13:29] works of your father you will do. I am
[1:13:31] saying unto you you are of your father
[1:13:34] God Almighty and the works of your
[1:13:36] father you will do. Let's stand
[1:13:38] together. Give him praise.
[1:13:46] Remember whatever we eat is producing an
[1:13:48] image. Whatever word we are feeding
[1:13:51] on. Maybe I didn't get to that. But how
[1:13:55] are they getting that image? By what
[1:13:57] they are feeding on this. The word they
[1:13:59] are receiving. They are receiving
[1:14:01] creeds,
[1:14:02] dogmas, man-made teachings, and they are
[1:14:05] producing
[1:14:06] this image unto the beast. We are eating
[1:14:09] the true word of God, and we are
[1:14:11] producing the life of
[1:14:14] Christ. The prophet would say it like
[1:14:16] this. We are feeding on the unfailing
[1:14:19] body word of the son of man.
[1:14:22] Amen. So I'm asking you even this
[1:14:25] morning, don't leave here without
[1:14:31] conception. The word is a
[1:14:34] seed. I had so much more to preach on
[1:14:36] this. Amen. But I'm saying the eating of
[1:14:39] the book is the wife receiving
[1:14:42] seed. Then the reproduced son, now the
[1:14:45] adopted son, must prophesy again.
[1:14:49] Now that we have the inheritance that
[1:14:50] Adam lost, we have the original
[1:14:54] spirit. The prophet says, "As you feed
[1:14:56] on the word, you become the
[1:14:59] word." Praise the
[1:15:05] Lord. With your heads bowed, your eyes
[1:15:07] closed, don't reject the Holy
[1:15:10] Ghost. The prophet is saying, if you
[1:15:12] reject the Holy Ghost, the message for
[1:15:14] your day, you will receive the mark of
[1:15:16] the beast automatically.
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:20] accepting creeds, teaching of
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:27] men. He's receiving the mark of the
[1:15:30] beast. But we are
[1:15:33] receiving the unfailing word of
[1:15:37] God.
[1:15:42] Amen. Let's sing. Amen. Glory. Thank
[1:15:46] you, Jesus. From glory to glory, he's
[1:15:52] changing
[1:15:54] me. He's changing me. He's changing
[1:16:00] me. His image and likeness to perfect in
[1:16:06] me. The love that God shows for it.
[1:16:10] Let's sing. He's changing me. For he's
[1:16:13] changing.
[1:16:16] He's changing me from the
[1:16:20] earthly to the
[1:16:23] heavenly. His likeness and image to
[1:16:27] perfect in me. The love that God shows
[1:16:32] for his
[1:16:34] bride. From glory to glory. He's
[1:16:39] changing me. He's changing me. is
[1:16:44] changing me. His likeness and image do
[1:16:49] perfect in me. The love that God chose
[1:16:54] to Let's sing now. He's changing me.
[1:16:57] He's
[1:16:58] changing. He's changing me from the
[1:17:03] earthly things to the
[1:17:07] heavenly. His likeness and image to
[1:17:11] perfect in me.
[1:17:13] The love that God shows for his bride,
[1:17:16] he's changing. He's
[1:17:20] changing. He's changing me from the
[1:17:24] earthly things to the
[1:17:28] heavenly. His likeness and image to
[1:17:32] perfect in me the love that God shows to
[1:17:37] his life. Amen. Aren't you happy this
[1:17:40] morning? Give the Lord a good hand a
[1:17:41] clap of praise. Amen. Bringing us back
[1:17:44] into the image and likeness again.
[1:17:47] Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe we'll just
[1:17:50] complete the stuff on Wednesday. Amen.
[1:17:52] The rest of it. Amen. There's so much
[1:17:54] there that we can keep expounding on.
[1:17:57] But as the Holy Spirit allowed us this
[1:17:58] morning, I pray, Amen. that many things,
[1:18:01] Amen. Maybe if you haven't heard it
[1:18:03] before in or in a long time, it will
[1:18:05] come fresh upon you even now to realize
[1:18:07] the importance of things. Now, now
[1:18:10] remember who is fixing this? Brother
[1:18:12] Brandham says the angel of the Lord is
[1:18:14] on earth now fixing
[1:18:16] everything getting it ready for the
[1:18:19] coming of the
[1:18:20] Lord. So while the Holy Spirit is fixing
[1:18:23] other things, external things, remember
[1:18:26] whatever happens here is internal in the
[1:18:28] body. Say holy spirit angel of God fix
[1:18:32] the inter internal
[1:18:34] things. Get rid of all my unbelief.
[1:18:37] Get rid of all my statue ways,
[1:18:39] lukewarmness, cold formal ways. Amen.
[1:18:43] Hallelujah. Don't kill the revival fires
[1:18:46] of God. That's another thing to stifle
[1:18:48] the Holy Ghost is when we can't rejoice
[1:18:51] with the things of
[1:18:52] God. Amen. Let's just close this part of
[1:18:55] the service. Father, we thank you for
[1:18:56] your word. We thank you,
[1:18:59] Lord. Lord, we know that revelation can
[1:19:02] only come from you, oh God. We thank you
[1:19:04] for the angel of God. We thank you for
[1:19:06] the Holy Spirit, Lord, that was present.
[1:19:08] You said, Lord, that you would lead us
[1:19:10] and guide us into all truth. It can only
[1:19:12] be the work of the Holy Spirit to lead
[1:19:14] us and guide us into all truth. So, we
[1:19:17] are thankful, Father, this morning, oh
[1:19:18] God. And Father, even as we, Lord, take
[1:19:21] uh stock of our own lives right now,
[1:19:23] Lord. I pray you'll wash us in the blood
[1:19:25] of Jesus. You'll cleanse us, Lord.
[1:19:27] You'll purify us, oh God. Father, you'll
[1:19:29] take away everything that's not of you,
[1:19:31] oh God. Father, we reject every other
[1:19:33] seed, oh God. We reject every other
[1:19:35] tradition, oh God. We reject every other
[1:19:37] carnal nature, oh God. And Lord, we
[1:19:39] crucify the flesh even this morning, oh
[1:19:42] God. And we are praying, Lord, the
[1:19:43] revival of the Holy Spirit will come
[1:19:44] upon us, Father. Lord, I pray the
[1:19:47] anointing of the Holy Spirit, Lord.
[1:19:49] Lord, I pray for the Holy Ghost itself,
[1:19:51] oh God, to come upon us and quicken us,
[1:19:53] Lord Jesus. I pray, Lord, that we will
[1:19:55] reproduce your life, oh God. Father,
[1:19:58] that we will be Christ on two feet
[1:19:59] again, Lord Jesus. Lord, we will
[1:20:02] manifest your glory, your image. Father,
[1:20:05] oh, we love you, Lord. Help us to bear
[1:20:07] your image. Lord, help us to bear our
[1:20:10] inscription in our spirit realm, in our
[1:20:13] flesh realm. Oh God, in our soul, oh
[1:20:14] God, that when they see us, Lord, they
[1:20:17] will see, Lord, this is Jesus Christ
[1:20:20] reproduced again. And Lord, in the
[1:20:23] flesh, Lord, the flesh, Lord, may entice
[1:20:26] us, Father, and bring many enticing
[1:20:28] things. But Lord, this morning we want
[1:20:30] to say, arise spirit man. I'm your boss.
[1:20:34] You will listen to me flesh. I reject
[1:20:37] the things of the flesh. I reject sin
[1:20:39] and unbelief.
[1:20:42] And I accept the Holy Ghost to seal me
[1:20:45] into the
[1:20:46] kingdom. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. I
[1:20:49] pray Lord for those that may have other
[1:20:51] needs and desires and seeking you Lord
[1:20:53] Jesus for Lord their daily needs and
[1:20:56] their daily Lord activities whatever
[1:20:58] they are trusting you Lord for you know
[1:20:59] their hearts father I pray you'll anoint
[1:21:02] them and bless them and grant to them
[1:21:03] the desire Lord I pray you'll bless
[1:21:05] every mother Lord even as they are
[1:21:06] raising up their children in the ways of
[1:21:08] the Lord I pray you continue to
[1:21:10] strengthen them Lord Jesus and Father
[1:21:12] when life seems to be throwing them Lord
[1:21:14] all kinds of anxiety stress Lord worries
[1:21:16] Lord I pray they will look to you Lord
[1:21:19] Lord Lord, Father, your word declares
[1:21:21] that in our weaknesses, Lord, your
[1:21:24] strength is made perfect in our
[1:21:26] weaknesses, Father. So, we we lay all
[1:21:29] our cares and our burdens at your feet,
[1:21:31] Lord. We pray you'll grant a special
[1:21:33] blessing to our mothers, Father. I pray,
[1:21:35] Lord, that you'll grant to them the
[1:21:36] desire of their heart, Lord. They lift
[1:21:39] us such unselfish lives, oh God. So, I
[1:21:41] pray, Lord, that even this morning,
[1:21:43] you'll pour out a special blessing,
[1:21:44] Lord, something extra for them, Lord.
[1:21:47] Pray you'll grant them the desire of
[1:21:49] their heart. I pray heal them Lord if
[1:21:50] they are sick. Deliver them if they are
[1:21:52] bound. Lord I pray Lord for your peace
[1:21:55] upon their hearts. Lord may they rejoice
[1:21:57] to know that they are daughter of God
[1:22:00] fulfilling your purpose in the earth. Oh
