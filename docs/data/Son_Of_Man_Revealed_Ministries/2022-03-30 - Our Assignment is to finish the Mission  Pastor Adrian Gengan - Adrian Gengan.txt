[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man so this evening we'll speak on a little thought called our assignment is to finish the mission our assignment is to finish the mission amen let's turn to exodus two and one exodus chapter 2 and this deals with the birth of moses and there was a man of the house of levi now we know levi is that priestly lion and took to wife a daughter of levi so you can see it's thoroughbred priesthood and the woman conceived now the word can only bring forth word amen every seed must bring forth of its kind you just read what kind of word this was levi would levi so what do you think they would produce they would produce a word born this is coming fresh they would produce a word born son [Music] and listen to what it says here in two and the woman conceived and bears son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hit him for three months and when she could no longer hide him she took for him an ark of bull rushes and dabbed him with slime and would pitch and put the childhood in and she laid it with the flags by the river's brink amen you may be seated just reading that verse alone exodus two and three when she could no longer hide him there's gonna come a time when you can no longer hide the word that is being made flesh in you amen you've got to show signs amen that you have conceived conception has taken place the baby starts to grow you may have been able to conceal it for a time maybe you've been ashamed to tell people that you're in the message of the hour but when that word starts to take a hold of you and it starts to form the process of a new birth within you you can no longer hide it like moses mother tried to hide him you have been called here for a specific purpose in this life and we must be conscious of the fact that we've only been allotted a certain amount of time the bible says it's three score and ten some of us go by the way of death even sooner some may go in the teens maybe when they're 20 30 40 50. no man know what the number of these days you know if you are pregnant now with modern science they can probably predict the time that you will be born on the earth but they cannot predict when you will leave the earth that has been allotted to god so we have a certain number of days that's been allotted to us on the earth and we should approach every day every hour with this in mind now when we live conscious of this it'll change our lives jesus asked one time don't you know i must be about my father's business he had an assignment that he needed to carry out and he was so determined to fulfill his purpose he had three and a half years to carry out the will of the father and he did not have time to be distracted with the cares of this life the fate of the world was hanging in a balance and jesus was on a mission to save man from his fallen state of sin now if jesus walked so conscious to the will of the father and the purpose that he had we who are part of him that we now claim that we know this hidden mystery that we are the wife of the lord jesus christ that was taken from his very own side then we his wife must know that we have been put on the earth to carry out an assignment a covert operation that has to do with the redemption of man first corinthians 1 and 21 it says he please god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe and in 25 it says because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men we that have been born again the prophet says we don't see things the way the world see things because we are from another world their spirit comes from above where there's holiness and righteousness dwells you must have come to a realization when you had that encounter with god that you were not from this world that is why brother branham came to a stage in his life and he said i am no longer the son of charles and ella branham he realized he was from another world the spirit that is from heaven from the seventh dimension came to the earth to influence and lead men and women of god but ask ourselves are we allowing the spirit to lead us he says any born again christian is an oddball to the world because you've been changed you're from another world your spirit is from across the chasm if you're not different there's something wrong you're still too earthbound you ought to be heavenly minded and heaven lives by the word now the prophet says that to reach the point of no return means that you're closer to the other side than from the point where i started and i feel that's where the bride is right now at the point of no return all bible prophecy regarding seven church age messengers have come to pass the seven stars that were in the hand of our lord jesus christ when he's standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks which type the seven church ages all of that has been fulfilled each one of those stars have been reproduced on the earth they have been clearly identified they have called out a people so we have reached a point point of no return like the prophet describes it i'm closer to the other side than i am from the point where i started so we are at the finish line in fact when we look through the eyes of prophecy you've got to admit we can see the finish line and we have this great cloud of witnesses we have this great cloud of witnesses in the sixth dimension that is looking beyond the cutting of time and are telling us keep pressing on keep pressing on as much as you can see the finish line they can see you approaching them because they without us cannot be made perfect so our lives must be so submitted to the assignment we've got to be so committed to the assignment those of you that are studying you know if you get an assignment regarding your studies if you do not complete your assignment you do not get graded you do not get your marks so just like that god has given us an assignment but he has not left us alone god knew that in our fallen condition we would need help from a supernatural world because the battle did not start in a natural world the battle started in heaven in a supernatural world and the battle that started in heaven was brought down to the earth and when it came down to the earth man fell at the slightest temptation of fallen angels man fell so god knew that man needed the assistance of a supernatural world and since the beginning of time adam's race has always been connected with the supernatural world there's no denying it if we follow the bloodline of adam's race you will find that we have been connected to that supernatural world and our connection to that supernatural world is the holy ghost the spirit of god was sent to dwell within man and that makes him one with his maker that makes him omnipotent amen god wants to live within us god wants to speak to us now he goes on to say he says as we walk upon the streets and rub hands with the world we are not supposed to be like those he says we step aside and give them their place talking about the worldly people he says lord we'll take the back seat knowing that we are delegates from another world we have a kingdom that's coming into power and our great king will soon arrive and take over all the kingdoms that's in his domain and he shall rule and reign with him on earth thousand years and be with him forever let's read galatians chapter 5 verse 7. we started the race we sang we had the finish line we sang we've reached the point of no return but sure did some of the first believers and listen what the apostle paul is telling them he said you did run well who did into you that you should not obey the truth he goes on to say that this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you the one who is hindering you in your christian walk is not the one who called you the one who called you has given you a specific mission on the earth and our assignment is to finish that mission don't go to the grave having not completed your mission on the earth if god has given you an assignment if god has made you let me give you an example if god has designed you that you were to be a writer of songs don't go to the grave without having those songs expressed without writing those songs don't go to the grave if god has given you a gift or maybe writing poetry of having those things dead within you in the grave but express it if god has called you to be an evangelist don't go to the grave without evangelizing the lust if god has called you to a purpose in life live to the best of your potential to fulfill that purpose if god has raised you up to be a father be the best father that you can be hold nothing back don't say i leave something when i am gone a good memory do it now while you can if god called you to be a mother be the best mother that you can and don't be afraid to instruct the children that you will offend their feelings you take the greatest of men and the strictest your parents and you'll find when they come into this great office that they hold they always remember a godly mother or father they always remember the counsel of their mother and father as rebellious as children are they are depending on your counsel so you keep counseling them you keep working on them you keep throwing that seed because you don't know when they will need that one day maybe at the lowest point they will sit and think back on what you told them and it could be a thing that turns their lives around so the apostle paul is telling them this persuasion came not of him that calleth you meaning that this one that that's injuring you and causing you not to run well is distracting you from your assignment now if you bring it down to a natural it could be a boy or a girl you know i was thinking about this the other day and i was thinking about life and how we we grow up in life and it's just the norm of things to be done we raise our children at every step of their way from the time they take their first breath right until the time they are old enough to choose their partner the parents are involved in every decision so they've never made serious decisions in their lives and suddenly when they hit their 20s we tell them go and find a partner it's the biggest choice they will make the most important choice they will make and yet it's their first choice they get to make you ever thought of that the most important choice it's one of the first choices we give them does that make sense what i'm saying even when you are trying to help them to study you give them some guidelines but when it comes to the matter of the heart nobody can stop it oh when that bad guy catches the eye of a girl he can turn her life around take her the other direction so what's the choices we make in life because that thing believe me if you mess up in that area if god called you to ministry you can't minister in that office hear me and hear me good if god called you to ministry and you mess up your life god cannot use you in the ministry you may be gifted because gifts and callings are without repentance but if you mess up god cannot use you and if you shall persist and want to do things in the kingdom you'll be doing a god a service without it being his will because god will not work outside of his will let's get back on topic amen when god does things he does things in a peculiar way because here were the children of israel that were down in egypt because of a famine that struck the land and they got comfortable living in egypt because they had the reputation of joseph being this great ruler who had stored up grain and saved egypt so they lived by this reputation and they became comfortable in the land they became comfortable in the land until they grew to be such a mighty nation pharaoh got scared when he looked at them he said these people are so great perhaps if we ever get into a war and the israelites side with the opposing army we will be defeated so let us deal wisely with him and then he starts to oppress them now god allowed moses to be born in the very house of egypt in pharaoh's own household but that did not make moses to be lenient when it came time to deal with them according to god's judgments god may have allowed you to grow up in an environment maybe it's a denominational environment maybe it's a a hindu environment a muslim environment whatever environment that god allowed you to be grown up in god had you there for a purpose amen but when it's time to leave maybe when you spend 40 years in the house of pharaoh you've got to burst forth amen because your pedigree is from another world and when moses realized that he was not pharaoh's sister's cell he left and got the things in a peculiar way because at the age of 40 moses was probably a good bulk man he looked like a military leader he looked like he was going to start a revolution he slew this one man it looked like god was going to deliver his people but then he flees into the desert and now he becomes a sheepherder taking care of jethro's cattle finds a woman marries up has children but the children of israel are down in egypt still being oppressed while moses is living his life for 40 years what was needed was his connection with the supernatural amen he was not going to get that connection with the supernatural if he stayed in egypt you will never get your connection with the supernatural if we still cling to denominational ideas please and darkness of man god has got to bring a separation now there's different levels to the anointing you we see this in moses life because in egypt he performed signs wonders miracles but there was still a third pool to come different levels to the anointing we find the children of israel so trap we find them trapped in egypt and the deliverance they were crying out they cried with bitter tears anguish the punishment of their masters was so great upon them they could barely enjoy it that's how some of us feel sometimes in life the cares of life way so heavy upon us that we can not contain this pain we cannot pay it and sometimes we cry out lord take me away that's how the children of israel were down in egypt they couldn't bear this pain and they were crying out for he delivered and there were rumors coming through the town that perhaps moses will return with their mighty army in fact every morning there was a watchman up on the tower looking out for a deliverer because they were promised a delivery would come and 40 years passes by and all hope was gone and god in the midst of this of this slavery in the midst of this pain there were warriors growing up in egypt by the name of joshua and caleb but it was not the appointed time as yet god can raise up sons in the house but wait for the appointed time they waited even though they might have had the ability even though they had the passion but they waited for the deliverer because they understood their ministry they were not the deliverer now it came every morning at sunrise they would run up to the watchtower and look was there an approaching army was there possibility of moses coming with an invading army maybe about midday they would come back down and say there's nobody coming until 40 years passes by but then in the evening time it shall be light departure glory you will surely find somebody decided to go up on the watchtower at evening time and they saw this whole man coming with a stick he meant his brother probably wondering who is this old man because moses had now aged and here was moses coming a one-man invasion to take over egypt now to the children of israel they had no knowledge of what happened to moses they didn't know that he he went up into the mountain and he he saw this pill of fire at this pillar of fire if you know what the pillar of fire is the pillar fire is the angel of the lord if you want to find that out type it out in your message search pillar fire angel of the lord the pillar of fire is the angel of the lord so the angel of the lord comes down and wraps himself around that bush the bush is not consumed moses was assigned for a mission until he met the pillar of fire then he was convinced that he could now go back to egypt even though he had his doubts even though he had his complexes church don't let your complexes and doubts and fears weigh you down and think that you cannot serve in the kingdom of god god will use you in spite of your complexes if you surrender yourself to him we find amen so it came about even in time here's this man marching into egypt he comes in at evening time you see moses was smart he wasn't going to come in the daytime he came in unannounced he came in at sunset on sunset mountain he came with when maybe the egyptian army wasn't even looking out because seven churches that passed by and he had all of them under his control task master after touch master writer after rider had defeated the children of israel he had them so oppressed truly took away baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ i was going to go into jesus but i'm tying the two stories together it took away the revelation of the one true god he brought in all kinds of creeds and darkness until now they were so beaten and oppressed titania had set him the dark ages 68 million christians put to death oh god's got judgment waiting for this mother babylon who persecuted the children they were beaten fed to lions saw the sander this gospel is dripping with blood it's tripping with blood this holy ghost gospel he is dripping with blood what was he trying to do he was trying to stop the mission to a broad mission amen but god had given his people an assignment amen amen and their assignment is full redemption their assignment is full restoration their assignment is to receive communication and nourishment from another world revelation 10 is communication from another world the same one that was in the bush the covenant angel was the same one that descended with the open book and he came because seven church ages that passed by and the church one was all but defeated but they needed a word the battle was hot and heavy this was a hot war amen and satan looks like he was winning the war because he had conquered every denominational church there was no church that believed the full gospel even though they called themselves full gospel there was no church on the face of the earth that believed the bible in the original way that paul preached and even though god had sent reformer after reformer he sent out the pentecostal revival the zoo's a street revival the church still managed to denominate so it looked like the assignment that man was given for to to get to revelation 10 where those seven founders went out to their voices was going to be foiled by the tactics of the enemy because after every three years that denomination died there was a revival and then he died there was a revival and he died because they denominated around a man around his system but god will stop at nothing to get his people out of egypt amen if it means plague after plague after plague god shook egypt that day 10 plagues rock egypt it was like 10 missiles 10 atomic bombs blasting through egypt until the final one was death until the fourth horse rider was named him and hell follow him if we are living in that time right now where in the age of the fourth horse rider listen what he says hell followed him every demon spirit from that flipped dimension is poured out on the earth so the battle is getting hot and heavy amen there's temptations all around you but this is not a carnal war this is a supernatural war this is a spiritual war and you must be prepared for battle so the church was backed up the church was maybe looking like at a point to email where they needed a timeout from the battle even the prophet after preaching in the first and second pool you remember he said oh lord i messed it up with the shoelaces when talking about the first and second pull he said i've explained it too much to the people and then they rose carnal impersonations trying to type moses with the prophet they followed carnal impersonations like jealous and generous who wanted to impersonate the gift of moses amen so much so that the prophet wants you to leave the ministry but then the lord showed him that if you leave the ministry you'll become like a homeless man and he said i waited i wanted all my life i waited for this message because he had the commission down in 1933 your message will forerun the second coming and all along in the evangelism field under the first and second pull he had no message because all he was doing was tying up the loose ends the things that ludimus the things that wesley missed the things the pentecostal missed but there was promise in revelation 10. when that mighty angel descends amen [Applause] that's what he needed he waited for connection from that other world and when he received connection from that other world watch that seventh trumpet now amen this is not a trumpeting angel but at the voice of that seventh angel when he began to sound mystery after mystery from 63 who is this melchizedek future home of the pride christ is the mystery of god revealed the serpent seed the seed is not here with a shack you take all the titles mystery after mystery was being funded forth knowing amen that it was prophecy for an end time people and that's how you received faith for a rapture the prophet says god brought moses into the world to do the job and god was determined that moses was going to carry out his plan so god gave him a different kind of schooling god gave william branham a different kind of schooling we're giving them schooling from a dead letter and not from the experimental standpoint of the new birth to meet the true and living resurrected lord jesus christ who is just the same tonight as he was in the days gone by moses meeting the angel of the lord in the burning bush he was better equipped in five minutes of talking with god face to face then it was 40 years training under theology look a man is better equipped to preach the gospel and stand before an audience with five minutes experience before almighty god then all the seminaries could etch out in a hundred years of experience that's right there's something happens and sometimes it's ridiculous but god designed it that you would be at this time in this hour to prepare for your body change oh bless the name of jesus amen he's worthy to be praised and adored now that he's got this word and he's blasting out mystery after mystery there's a people who catches that mystery and he says this in the message church order in 63 december he says god is looking to me to see that i stay in the word he says and i'm looking to you to see that you carry out the word remember our thought very simple thought our assignment is to finish the mission god is looking to me to see that i stay in the word and he said i am looking to you to see that you carry out the word keep it spiritual for remember all the forces of the dark kingdom of satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow in the lord and you must be soldiers not just fresh recruits your aged soldiers now have been trained to fight and satan will come among you and cause you to dispute with one another if you can turn him down just immediately you're brethren and it's the enemy and we're here to hold the standard in this evening lifetime when the world is darkened and the whole church kingdom is going into the council of churches and pretty soon they'll take a sign to this door closed and then we're going to meet in other places oh praise the lord he doesn't say we can't meet yes he says we'll meet in other places amen amen amen because they'll certainly close these churches one of these days if we don't take the mark of the beast and we're depending on staying true to god till death sets us free and that's what we intend to do do you intend to do that till death sets us free to stay true to the word don't let nothing hinder us our assignment firstly we've got to ask ourselves do we understand the assignment you got to be a trained soldier you know a soji is rugged he can be shot out in the battlefield going to shot with every doubt of the enemy pain things of of this life but he's still persevering to serve the lord shut left in the cold in the battlefield maybe there's nobody else around you but a soldier is trained to pick himself up and to reconnect himself with the rest of the soldiers a soldier is designed for rugged territory for spiritual warfare wickedness in high places the kingdom of god suffereth violence and even though the violence are taking by force seven church ages they took by force until they came up against one called branham who smacked them around amen with under daddy's authority and there's a bride of people called out in the end time who have been commissioned who have been assigned amen who have been called for this final battle so our assignment is to finish the mission so know what the assignment is know what the mission is know what stage of the journey we are in listen to what the angel told lot escape further because i can do nothing until you reach that city and i feel the angel is telling you tonight get yourself ready something is fixing to happen something is already happening in the bride amen amen they didn't know it back then egypt that something happened that night at evening time when moses walked into the camp moses was fixing to tear that kingdom down and tonight we are fixing to tear satan's kingdom down and that's what happens when you preach under inspiration spirit of god comes amen and he tears down the enemy he breaks the yoke of the enemy yes amen our assignment get the last one in amen we've been sent with a special assignment what was that assignment and where we went secretly and told martha the master has come and called it fully amen it will be a sudden secret catching away amen we've got to be ready something is fixing to happen were you blessed tonight amen coming to the house give the lord a hand in there he's worthy to be praised hallelujah sweet [Music] oh such a sweet i know indeed [Music] pouring out the ore and one life of my team rushing [Music] or singing out sweet sweet [Music] pouring out the oil and wine all over me let's try it one more time sweet [Music] sweet [Music] pouring out to make me clean life a mighty rushing way or sing sweet sweet sweet [Music] it's pouring out the oil and wine all over me [Music]
