amen so let's Stand Together amen amen so the Lord has been building us up this year huj and building us up to the point where I believe we are reaching perfect Faith amen hallelujah thank you Lord amen hallelujah let's turn to Mark 9:23 there for opening scripture I got a few scriptures to read amen just want to start with this Amen in mark 9:23 amen Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth amen hallelujah now Sister meie you need to lock into these scriptures amen all things are possible to them to him that believeth amen now you can hear the word of God without believing it it can just become something you hear but you must believe it okay so that's our you know that's our theme amen that all things are possible to him that believeth and that's the the song only believe was taken out of the scripture and the angel of the lord loves the song amen amen hallelujah so let's get to our scriptures now in Revelation chapter 6 amen going into that fourth seal now praise the Lord amen look behold pay loss and his name that set on him was death and Hell Followed him and power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to kill oh my they're going to kill with sword yes with Hunger that's famine yes and death and beast of the earth they're going to spread there they're going to breede their germs and they're going to spread it across the Earth they're going to Amen to manipulate it with the Ukraine war and cause hunger amen and sword yeah and with death amen Ephesians 6 finally my brethren this is verse 10 now be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand the vials of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day that's today and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins G about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet sh with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take on the shield of Faith amen amen amen thank you Lord where with you shall be able to quench all the fiery DTS of the wicked and take the elet of Salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God now it doesn't stop there with the armor yes he has another weapon praying always with with all prayer and supplication In the Flesh in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen another portion of scripture amen just need to get through these scriptures 2 Corinthians chapter 10:3 for we walk for though we walk in the flesh we do not war in the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through the through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every eye thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ who is doing this we are doing itah amen Revelation 12:7 amen Revelation 12:7 hallelujah amen let me tell you something if you think this is a place I desire to be I do not desire to be here amen this is one of the most amen uh sacred places to be amen amen it puts you in a nervous condition amen amen sometimes you just want to get away from the pet amen hallelujah because you know the responsibility and the burden amen hallelujah Revelation 12 and verse 7 and there was war in heaven amen Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not amen hallelujah am the Bible is declaring they Prevail not hallelujah amen hallelujah neither was there any any their place found anymore in heaven amen amen and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceive the whole world and he was cast into the Earth and his angels were cast out out with him amen and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night and they overcame in by the blood of the Lamb amen the blood still stands strong and the word of their testimony so we can't keep silent amen amen we need to get dumb Spirits off of us amen and keep Tes Ying amen and they love not their lives unto their death amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so we find there was a battle that started in heaven amen hallelujah but then the battle came down to the Earth amen that's why you feel this oppression that's why you're feeling demonic Powers amen you are in being influenced amen by either two Realms either Angelic beings or demonic Powers amen this morning my title is sons of God angels and demon powers spiritual warfare hallelujah amen now sons of God we got Angels on the Earth but then we got fallen angels as well and it's a great spiritual warfare if you thought you were born into a good family amen just to be raised up in a good home in a Christian home and to live a good life and stature your own family have a good job and have a home you are solely mistaken you are put on the earth to combat Satan amen you are put on the earth to become a soldier in the army of Christ amen hallelujah so we find amen that this battle started Amen in Heavens but it came down to the Earth and we see what happened in Eden amen we see how man fell from his position amen but we have been restored back to our original position amen how many of you know what restoration is if you take a old car and you restore it you restore it back to its original condition amen praise the Lord amen amen it's restored back to its original position you're not getting something else amen if you had a v8 car you restoring it back to a V8 that's right you're not putting a 900 cc engine in there and calling it rest restoration that's not restoration that's replacement amen that's conversion but Jesus said you must be born again amen amen there are two classes of people on the Earth right now they are the sons of Adam and then there's the sons of God Sons of Adam are dying and will go to the Grave without eternal life but the sons of God Amen the sons of God are born again of his spirit amen and if the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it will also Quicken our mortal bodies amen so we find here the battle climax where at Calvary when God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself so that Sons and Daughters could come back to God amen amen now we the reconciled ones are coming back to sunship coming back to Dominion authority to take our rightful inheritance amen Satan at one time had the leg Authority yes amen that's why he could offer it to Jesus the kingdoms of this world had one time he had the legal Authority what Satan lost was given over to what what Adam lost was given over to Satan so he became the ruler the God of this Earth but Jesus came to put him in his place amen amen and God subjected himself to his own law amen sir amen God himself knew that in order to redeem man the the price for the sacrifice must be paid the price for Redemption must be paid amen so God subjected God will walk in his own word he won't walk outside of his word he required a lamb in the beginning in Garden of Eden so that's why they to take a sinless spotless lamb Jesus Christ to come to Die For Us amen Jesus died for us Jesus Paid his Christ on the cross amen Jesus shed his blood on the cross so that you and I can go free amen so that you and I all our sicknesses all our diseases he be on the cross our deed of death our deed of condemnation he nailed it to the Cross so that you and I can go free that's the power that's the message of the Gospel amen amen we don't have to live defeated lives there's nothing to be added to it Christ has done it all and he come to give man back the legal authority over the Earth amen amen I'm talking about full restoration I'm talking about full Authority where you have dominion over the Earth again that's what I want to get back to the man that God said let us make man in my image amen let him make me let let me make him after my likeness that's the man I'm created to be I want to go back to that and nothing less amen hallelujah hallelujah amen am so we find the redeemed ones are rising up to the god-given potential amen and the final war is being waged between the sons of God angels amen that are here to assist the sons of God and demonic powersall amen what is it God in us Amen in that day you shall know that as I was in the Father the father in me I in you amen the Bible says greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world greater is he that's in you than your sickness greater is he that's in you than your problems amen greater is he that's in you than your circumstance so how can we sit around depressed how can we sit around amen anxious when the one who the problem solver is within us hallelujah amen thank you Lord amen praise the Lord amen which day this day in that day Jesus said this is the day yes the fullness of God Amen he now being reflected in a many membered body the power of God working through us to do the Greater Works and to finish the work you know and pick up your pen and write he says he couldn't finish it all through that Virgin Mary he says but he's got another Mary now amen amen he says look at what it's coming to what is it it's going right back the way it did back in Eden amen you know what oh hallelujah amen you know we we influence our children and we teach them the ways of God and and we tell them don't hang around the wrong company and we can we can mold them and shape them and tell them that boy is of bad character and that girl is of bad character you shouldn't be associating with them you know we can lead them and we can guide them but sometimes we need to look beyond the physical because the physical is easy to spot and identify but we need spiritual mothers and fathers amen because there's a demonic world there's a demonic Force come to influence the people and it's coming via social media it's coming via cell phones it's coming via movies it's coming by all the fourth dimension hallelujah amen amen so it's good to protect our children amen amen but can we guide them spiritually as well amen amen hallelujah amen get them to that cross amen get them to an experience in Christ amen hallelujah how do you say you say how do I get them I cannot force him no but you keep them in an atmosphere amen where there can be birth amen praise the Lord amen I tell you the battle is hot and heavy Satan is on a rampage right now amen hallelujah seeking to influence men seeking to corrupt men who are these angels they amen who are these demonic forces there were angels that were in heaven L am amen Lucifer is now called Satan Lucifer had the music Lucifer was a covering Angel Lucifer amen hallelujah was in control of the worship service in heaven I rather talk slowly softly because the musicians won't think I'm bashing them but it's very important I'm going to say music team so that nobody thinks I'm if I say song leader this that and then they're going to think I'm talking about them but it's important the music team he prayed up because you can disturb the entire service remember you are coming up front it's important for the music team to be filled with the Holy Ghost AM hallelujah it's important for the music team to be born again filled with the Holy Ghost and not have something Satan had p r i d e Pride amen amen Pride amen musicians watch what you do your actions you know you're sitting here in the service you playing music here and suddenly you get upset with the song leader you're getting upset with the song leader you're making this that that way you're getting frustrated you're causing a spirit here you're causing commotion here amen then the song leaders as well need to be anointed they need to be prayed up because they can also cause chaos here by being super nervous don't remember they are here to conduct the service if you are so extremely nervous how you going to conduct the service and settle the people because you they're going to feed off your anointing they're going to feed of your nervousness amen you need to come pray up amen don't stumble around amen have your songs prepared brother brandom says they must be there half an hour amen that song service half an hour if there's a song special you get it in if there's a testimony you get it in amen and he says do not try and preach in that time it's not your place to preach it's your place to sing the songs so flow from one song to the next amen I think amen many people have not read Church order they don't know how the the prophet says amen the piano and the organ is the property of the church amen he says then the music should flow amen amen hallelujah you know the the angel of the Lord can play music yeah he can play music right plus he learned Fanny Crosby song yeah yeah some message people I don't like the him we must sing only in modern songs I mean sorry only certain songs one time the sister got caught up in the Holy Ghost and that's why I'm saying sometimes our musicians need to leave their music too now the old church is worshiping and here they are they never get lost in worship hey when we tell you notice something now watch I'm I'm telling you something here now when the whole church is worshiping and there's a breakthrough going on the only people not worshiping is the musicians because now they want to play and they want to now show you their skill and that was the time for me to get my lead pieces there and things to impress you see I'm talking about me now amen then musicians have a special power they can disappear they only reappear after the service you didn't know that they have the superpower watch it when you go to combines and all of these things the musicians have their own meeting outside they be standing and talking they think they not they they excluded from the service how many of you have seen it brother suban you saw that combin meetings conventions musicians out back there hey they have drinking water Coke this that they finished from that service half now they don't need the word now they they discussing this that they're discussing the sound how terrible it was and this and that and the other we don't need the service now after they complain they they running back to go play When the passor calling with the terrible sound in everything so I'm saying watch the spirits out there influencing now the ministry is depending on the musicians who set the atmosphere that's right but now if they all out of cater and there's problems going on why am I saying this it happened in heaven with the music and Satan came down to the Earth with the music so I was telling you about the sister she was playing the piano and she got into the spirit and she just began to leave the piano and began to Worship the Lord she began to dance in the spirit sisters and and she began to dance in the spirit sisters amen amen and then the piano kept on playing the great phys now the angel knew the cords the angel knew the notes the sying Jesus amen hallelujah hallelujah what are we after why am I saying this we after the anointing we after his presence amen if the Holy Ghost is a gentleman we don't want to do anything to displease him now there's a person a congregant here who's in need of prayer who in need of healing but because of all the chaos and the disruptions going on the angel can't move amen so that's just imp passing amen we need to amen be careful when we come into the service and the atmosphere and the anointing we carry amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so we find Satan come down to destroy God's creation what God had created himself Satan had come down to destroy that was his purpose amen coming you on the earth now in the message here let your light so shine before men preached in 1961 let your light so shine before men in paragraph 158 it says the people are looking for class and do you know that the devil lives in class do you know what caused the first battle in heaven was when Lucifer set up a greater class of people to get get a better class of angels He thought build a bigger Kingdom a more brighter shinier Kingdom than Michael had and he was kicked out of heaven see where classes come from stay away from class yes amen now in paragraph 159 there he says the hungry don't want class the hungry wants food yes sir the cold wants fire not a picture and the hungry and they that hunger and thirst for God wants the gospel and the power of Jesus Christ you know I I found that to be true because in this last week we did a couple of days of Outreach work and you know the hungry really were looking for food that's right amen yes so I was thinking the next time we really do Outreach walk we must take sandwiches or take something and go because there are some people that will sit to listen but they are so hungry yes and they walking around looking for food amen amen amen they're looking for food and I'm telling you there's a great burden there's a great need amen just standing here by the plaza and letting the prophet's voice Thunder out through there and watching people come by and I never asked people to come by me for prayer they started to line up there aunties with dots aunties with this that and the other amen amen they are really hungry for truth amen they can't get it in the churches when the sick and the destitute and and the people that are really in trouble get to the churches they have to sit in a service for 1 hour listening to music then they have to spend 45 minutes them trying to collect money and then the word is 15 20 minutes and they leave the people amen hallelujah so we don't want class amen we want to meet the need amen Satan is looking for class amen hallelujah praise the Lord let's get to the fourth seal now 1963 the fourth seal paragraph 3:10 he says look what is's riding a Pale Horse Grizzly colored horse mixed with black red white coming to the battle what is he doing now on the horse that we just read brother Bram says he's Gathering his subjects from every nation amen under heaven did not Daniel interpret the dream and see that streak of iron run through into every kingdom here they come now the prophet says sit still for a minute and listen close remember he's about to bring the revelation of the seal now he says they are gathering in now to do it bringing his subjects from the four corners of the earth riding a pale sickly three colored mixed SCE same man that's right amen that's the fourth seal paragraph 311 amen now in Revelation 19 not only is he getting ready but Christ is getting ready to meet him the battle is going to be hot and heavy Christ in Revelation 19 Christ is gathered not from the four corners of the Earth because there's going to be a little bitty Remnant aren't you glad you're one of them what's he doing he's Gathering them from the four corners of Heaven amen he says we get them Souls under the altar tomorrow night and see whether it's right or not four corners of Heaven on his Snow White Horse he also has a name not death remember the rider on the pale hor his name is death but the rer on this White Horse coming in Revelation 19 is called the word of God he's called life he's got a name written on his side the word of God and there's only one form of life and that's Zoe life he said it's God he's the only source of eternal life there is Zoe that's right and he got it wrote Life riding on a white horse and here is the man with three different powers mixed up Called Death Gathering his Earthbound delegates and Christ is gathering his heaven born subjects and he's got death wrote on him and Christ has got life wrote on him whose horse will you ride they are two Riders one on a Pale Horse and one on a white horse whose horse will you ride come on now thank amen praise Lord he says in paragraph 3:15 those with him are on white horses amen amen say white horses white hes amen and they are called The Chosen before the foundation of the world Amen that's Ephesians amen

Along coming down to meet him they know are you PR can I read the quote they know the Thunders will issue the thing for us pretty soon hallelujah oh Hallelujah say Lord let it thunder amen amen amen the prophet says if you're an ambassador of Heaven All Heaven is behind you amen all Heaven is consisted of the word amen amen praise the Lord amen the prophet says in Junction of time here he says all hell is let loose is that what the fourth seal said hell followed him all hell is let loose but here in in Junction of time paragraph 29 he says when all hell is turned loose all Heaven turns loose amen if you can see the Demonic influence if you can see Sodom in their condition if you can see amen women in their nakedness if you can see men in their drunkenness if you can see men in their shame being influenced by demonic Powers no one thing of assurity all Heaven is upon the Earth and there's only a few people that will connect with all of Heaven and the Angelic host that's here on the earth Hallelujah I don't think you are hearing me amen hallelujah stop connecting to Wi-Fi and connect with Angel connect with the Unseen World some of us are more connected on Wi-Fi than with the supernatural amen come on now help me preach amen help me kill the devil help me give him a blue high help me cast him out amen amen if you found in these things amen now is not the time to be found in unbelief those things that have got your attention is because of demonic power and activity you say it's harmless it calms me no the word of God is the most calming influence upon your life amen the word of God is what was given to man praise the Lord when the enemy comes in like a flood amen the spirit of God raises up a standard against it hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah you find the enemy coming in like a flood amen hallelujah amen Netflix giving you suggestions after movie after movie coming in like a flood you like like a zombie amen taking in all of these things amen then you become powerless yes you become amen somebody that can't operate in prayer somebody that can't operate in the spirit amen you become blinded to the things of the world Amen and the things that we stood for in the message of the hour and the things amen that we stood firm upon the first generation stood firm upon amen and labored Amen to SW that seed amen we find Amen in the third generation all the bars have been let down amen and Satan is coming in like a flood to consume the people and people are caught up in religion going to message churches but as dead as a door nail am amen amen hallelujah just because you put a tie just because you dress fine and come to church doesn't mean amen that you have an experience with God Amen what we need is that Pentecostal experience amen what we need is another act two again in the church amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord oh come on some of you are really starching now amen amen amen some of you need to raise your hands and worship him some of you need to praise the Lord amen hallelujah stop sitting in the church like a zombie amen I'm not a lecturer I haven't come here to entertain you amen I'm not a teacher amen for you to sit here and L look amen you know what you remind me of brother Jeff you know what they remind me of you remember the prophet dangling this thing before the baby right and he said the baby just dead that's exactly the look you got amen no amen no hallelujah amen praise the Lord and you know where your joy is watch what makes you excited the times of the day other times of the week watch what makes you excited and can really talk amen you're like a chatter chatter chatter chatter suddenly even other people he I thought he was a cat you know what that IND the what Tamil word is I thought you I thought you can't talk but you suddenly thank you Lord the spirit hits them and they can talk like unknown tongues to because it's unknown to you the things that they can tell you hey demonic Powers demonic influence if the word of God can't excite you nothing else will you know where you are you know who off you riding can't fool you you know I maybe you can fool me maybe you can fool the Deacon the ministers you can fool one another you can't fool yourself you know whose hor you are writing amen amen so he says all heaven will turn loose Angels appearing signs and wonders on the earth the counterfeits are rising God is proving which is right and wrong the counterfeits are here amen the counterfeits are here and they will come within the framework of the message so Angelic beings come down in a war with demonic influence over Sodom and Gomorrah now we were there and we're really there in Genesis 18 and 19 now that's where we really are that's why we're dealing with demonic warfare and we're dealing with sons of God because Abraham and Sarah were sons of God and angels came down to connect with them but there was all also demonic activity you see when you're reading Genesis 19 and you see that the The Three Angels Came Down in Genesis 18 why have they come down because all L was let loose upon Sodom and gomorra you need to read between the lines here now yes because we're in another day of Sodom now it's Luke 17:30 time Malachi 4 time as it was in the day so shall it be so when you're seeing now these angels go down to Sodom and you see Abraham before they bargaining and they go down to Sodom and you are just seeing reading the story from the external you are seeing corrupt men trying to interfere with these men with these angels but you what you're not seeing is the Demonic influence over them that Sodom was in such a state that cry went up to heaven that it caused God to come down to see whether these things be true now who took the report up to God Angelic beings yes amen that's right when God told them in Egypt they I've heard the Cry of my people people Angels on the earth messenger Angels taking the report back to God back to God amen amen God is omnipresent because of his omniscience yes hallelujah amen amen the prophet will teach us now you go and search it out God is a being that's right and he can be in one place at one time right but because of his omnicient because he knows all things it's like he's in all places that's right amen amen amen or you never read that before that's right amen the prophet teach us these things so yeah Angels taking Messengers angels are messengers taking the report back to the father this is what's happening this is what's happening this is what's happening still it grieved the heart of God so much that he said I must go down and see it for myself amen but while he's coming down he gives life to the sons of God he changes their bodies am because all hell is let loose upon Sodom and gomorra and the influence is spreading and there are corrupt men there amen and if you go and look what happened to Sodom and gomorra that place is like sulfur that's right atomic fire fell down yes Warfare who caused it to rain fire and bromstone God God burnt those cities amen now watch in the time yeah lot lot as a family and lot as Grand children like the prophet who dramatized lot has got sons and he's got children now he must have had other children there because remember the two girls that he offered he says they were not married untouched yes so he had other children that's right right and he had grandchildren and you go read the story it's so dramatic that the angel has to pull them by their hands and get them they didn't want to leave that's right and the the angel is telling him flee and lot still wants to bargain he wants to go to a nearby City but all of that was supposed to be burnt but the angel concedes and tell him okay go to that City I won't burn it but now all of them are looking for seed watch the chapter now it's very it's hidden there yes amen lot is left without seed yes and Abraham has no seed yes and God has come down to confirm with Sarah you're going to have a child amen and you should call his name Isaac but watch in a perversion now Satan's perversion the daughters go and lie with lot because lot has no seed lot was not given a promise that your seed shall be anything amen lot was given no inheritance lot was given no promise the only blessings lot received is because of his association with Abraham amen amen yes just like amen the prophet would tell us those that do good to the bride will have the reward am amen your friends your families amen they are blessed because of their association with you whether they choose to believe it or not amen Hallelujah but watch the association now we were talking about Association you know we tell our kids don't do this don't do this don't do that but then we associate with unbelievers we associate we go to their things we go for it that's one thing we were not liked in our family is because we never attended their functions amen they want to have porridge prayers we got porridge in the house Jung we are porish prayer every morning you pray before you is amen so you pray for your porridge no come for this no come for that no come for this no we don't go for nothing they know we got church till they got fed up they don't invite us and that's the best thing ever amen amen Hallelujah but now we if we're feeling comfortable in their presence if we feeling comfortable around them that surrounding something is wrong because now we remember we all claim Holy Ghost fill right imagine the Holy Ghost is enjoying this thing what's feeding on them not the Holy Ghost amen not the Holy Ghost yes when you're watching series and and what they call it binge watching hey the Holy Ghost in you is you're so rejoicing y look at this y shooting you think the Holy Ghost is doing that hey now it's not you you need to preach it to other people I'm not preaching to you it's not affecting any of us here so please go and tell this to somebody else who's watching all of these things because the angel of the Lord is speaking about these things and tell them in church it wasn't as none of us here I don't know but you know you guys you must stop watching your movies and your Netflix and and going sitting in these discos and sitting in these uh parties and things because that must prophesy again Hallelujah amen hallelujah you see sometimes we are so unaware of activity Angel Angelic activity yes and demonic activity so unaware because we are caught up in life trying to pay the bills trying to make ends meat trying to put food on the table we got the story backwards when you come into the kingdom the kingdom says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all of these things shall be added unto you when you come that way you can put a demand on God you can put a claim in amen yeah you finally Joshua chapter 5 chter Joshua 5:13 they're going for Jericho yes they're going they're going to finish the city of and they are unaware that there's a host of angels coming down oh yes you see let me bring it down to you in ways you may understand you going to the doctor's office the angels are with you you're going to work the angels are with you you're going to school the angels are with you am they are there who was it that saved you sister El sister Jen who was it thank you Lord wherever you go here you find in verse 13 it came to pass Joshua was by Jericho he lifted up his eyes and behold there stood a man over against him with a sword drawn in his hand what happened now Joshua's eyes were open to a spiritual Dimension Hallelujah this not everybody could see and that's why my pray is Lord open our eyes open the veil if you could see right here all over here amen going to shock your theology too Heaven's not thousands and thousands of miles and kilometers away brother brandham says it's in another dimension just here he says it's in a slanted Dimension you remember when brother Brandon was in the sixth Dimension he says I looked across and I saw my body in the bed he didn't say I to take one telescope now and zoom back to Earth abble telescope he didn't go and take the app telescope there amen hey amen how many of you think you were zooming no telescope there he says I looked there was my body laying on the bed he calls it a slanted Dimension one so close is it why Jesus said amen the son of man is ascending and descending was he moving between Dimensions that people knew nothing about amen which dimension did Elijah and and Moses appear from amen they on the mountain and then in a moment's time they go back back amen so yeah Joshua's eyes is open to this Dimension and he sees this man and he says Thou force all our adversaries and he says n but as the captain of the host what's host he's talking about Angelic host Angels he's the captain of the Angels but captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship hall now Joshua knew better to worship an angel but this is Jehovah Angel hallelujah amen what say my Lord unto his servant he wants instruction and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose th shoe there's the sign there's the language as I was with Moses so shall I be with you you want the same experience as Moses you need to go through the same way get your shoes off of you amen loose your shoe from off your foot for the place whereon thou stand us is Holy and Joshua did so amen amen you see The Obedience that follows yes very quickly now 2 Kings chapter 17 2 Kings chapter 17 is a very prophetic scripture because it's dealing with an Elijah an elishah anointing but it's it's typing an En time people as well it's typing our prophet and it's typing the third pole and it's typing a lot of things here so it starts out here you'll see here in amen if you read Second Kings it says it talks about the sons of the prophet and now they were saying the place where we dwell is too straight for us because straight is the gate and narrow is the way amen amen they didn't want to live in the straight way so they tell let us go we pray unto Jordan and take against every man a beam and let us make a place there you see they wanted their own place of worship they wanted to make their own way of worship Blasphemous names where we may dwell and Elisha answered go he and one said be content I pray thee and go with thy servants and he answered I will go and so he went with them and when they came to Jordan they cut down wood but as one was fing a beam the ax head fell into the water and he cried alas Master for it was borrowed and the man of God said where fell it and he showed him the place and he cut down a stick and cast it into the and the iron did swim thank you amen so here's the supernatural happening amen praise the Lord therefore he said take it up and he put it out of his hand and took it right now what is the a the a here we know remember we talking about elishah and the spirit of Elijah Works how many times five times five times amen and didn't it tell us in Matthew 3:10 that the ax is laid to the root of the tree who's the ex amen the ax is the head it's called the ax head and who's the one chopping down and ring what did it say The Apostle amen the John the Baptist he says the ax is laid to the root of the trees therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cast down and thrown into the what fire so this picture that John is p painting is telling us that God has taken out his ax and begin to First chop the trees that he will strike that judgment is impending it's a time of investigating judgment amen amen so the ax is laid to the root the ax is used to cut unbelief the a amen is used to kill the root to kill the tree to kill the root of unbelief amen and Elijah has come again in this day to restore the a hallelujah hallelujah is Malachi 4 a message of restoration amen hallelujah same Elijah anointing with another acts that's tearing down and cutting and shopping every unbelief amen praise the Lord so Elijah anointing in a Ministry of restoration and anything lost under the ministry of Malachi 4 must be restored I don't think you're hearing me Malachi 4 is a restoration message Malachi 4 is here to restore everything that was lost all the years that was lost Malachi 4 message if you are sitting and under the voice and influence of Malachi 4 message you must receive restoration if it's your health you must receive restoration if it's your family you must receive restoration whatever you lost under this ministry it must be restored hallelujah hallelujah amen if Satan has taken your health for 7 years they is coming back a restoration of seven years Hallelujah if Satan has stolen your joy maybe one two years amen it's coming back under a Ministry of restoration oh I don't think you're hearing me amen Malachi 4:5 and 6 go listen what it says it's a Ministry to restore us back to turn our hearts back amen for far too long the church has lost it sir amen 2,000 years of church history and made the church weak formal cold powerless but under the message of restoration amen we are coming back to the original Pentecostal blessings to the original Pentecostal experiences amen you can choose to live under your god-given privileges amen but I'm choosing amen sometimes we don't even understand what we are talking about we just use phrase words amen you know you get Scholars yes brother we have the word we have the opening of the word they call it opening of the word right and the what is the opening of the word you ask that person that's telling you that tell them my pastor said I'm must ask you what is the opening of the word right and then now they're going to and they may try to spin something but tell them go back to this quote now this messenger of Malachi 4 vers 5 and 6 will do two things Hallelujah he will rece reveal the Mysteries right according to Revelation chapter 10 verse 7 right you'll reveal the Mysteries and then it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn our hearts back to what back to what what of the Pentecostal father back to the faith now here's an easy way to get to it if I can't see your heart turned back to the faith because Faith you can see it amen hello amen Faith you can see it and Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of Acts so tell them okay I got Bas here amen you telling me you got the opening of of the word you are telling me that your heart is turned back to the original Apostolic fathers yes bmus let's close you quickly making uncomfortable for us it's either we want the original or nothing yes Bas you are saying that your heart has been turned back you sure your head hasn't been turn back you only got head knowledge that's right you got a theory you got the theory so packed so well you know some people become academics some become Professor what they call them Joshua help meia they become they get their phds doctor's degree but they never ever go and do what they qualified for they become lecturers of it you know that there are some people I'm just going to use law now that are so up in law they never ever practice a day in their life you put them in a courtroom these Chetty Brothers will finish them hey what's what am I saying they got the experience one has got just the theory never put the application so when anybody tells you we have the opening of the word which is 100% true but what did the opening of the word come to do if you have asked yourself that I'm going to teach you now what did the opening of the word come to do when we talk about opening of the word what word this word this word was a sealed book this word was a closed book even now we're talking about here Joshua's eyes being open opened and you're going to see now the Lord the Elisha says open the boys's eyes denominations read this book and their eyes are closed they read Acts 2:38 and they can't see it that's right but your eyes are open you can see it yes you read here about the godhead they can't see it but you can see it that's right what is that a veil is before their eyes but our eyes are become unveiled amen can you say praise the Lord praise the Lord prise the Lord blessed are your eyes for they see the things of God hallelujah amen so there's a fine line there between Theology and schooled in theology but if you are not like the early disciples something is wrong something is wrong with your experience not with the word then you need to check up amen yes you need to check up what is wrong with me don't put the blame on somebody else check up your own life amen so we find it it starts out with a very prophetic scripture because he restores the Ed back to the church yes if you see it in type there Elisha restores the a Ed which is a type of the Ed back then he goes on and we find the king of Syria here in verse 12 it says oh King but elishah the Prophet that is in Israel tell the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber so this man is able to know the secrets of men's art he's able to discern things right and we find here they go to Doan you know that's a place where Abraham has once it's a place called two Wells it's also the place where Joseph's brothers left they left the one place and they went to Dothan so you see they went after two Lords Doctrine there so two Ls amen so they come to Elisha and what I'm trying to show you here is Genesis 19 the ministry to be able to open and closed eyes blind eyes remember the Angels blinded them right so you'll find here in in verse 15 16 and 17 Elijah Elisha comes before the Army and they say we're looking for Elisha but Elisha closes their eyes now he doesn't blind them like they can't see M he blinds them as they can't recognize him then he leads an entire Army right into Israel and then he says here in verse 17 and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see okay I'm sorry I'm I'm in verse 20 I'm in verse 20 and it came to pass when they were come into Samaria that Elisha said Lord Open the Eyes of these men that they may see and the Lord Lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of Samaria amen that's 2 Kings chapter 20 now in verse 17 of 2 Kings I'm going to read this quickly they want to find this man who's revealing their secrets and who is exposing them so they take an army and they Sur around this place where they are it says here in verse 10 and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice so you see two two times it passed so they under the third pool now therefore the heart of King Assyria was so troubled for these things and he called his servants and said unto them will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel and one of his servants said none my Lord oh King but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel tell the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber so he says go and fetch him and in verse 14 he sent forth to the horses chariots and a great host yes and they came by night and compassed the city about and the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth and behold an O Compass the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do so he's looking at this great Army surrounding them and he said in verse 16 fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them that's why I'm telling in your daily lives quote the scripture Lord I believe they are more with me than the enemy and Elisha prayed and said I pray thee open his eyes yes so there's a spiritual eyesight to be open to see this Dimension amen and the Lord opened his eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about elishah thank you Lord amen and when they came down to him so yeah so you see why I'm showing you this Elisha has the ministry to open and close eyes so the same preaching when you when people are reading the message and they blinded to it and yet others eyes are open to it and the prophet says sometimes I say certain things in a certain way to amen for the unbelievers that's right to confuse them that's right amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah oh praise the Lord I just want to close on this here very quickly amen if you go to the first slide this second slide he says now to see whether this message we got is connected with it or not the very hour that Israel was signed in to be a nation it was the same very day same month I was supposed to be in Greens Mill Indiana when that angel day appeared to me and sent me out into the field with this and after that he met me in the river and told me what would take place then commissioned me 11 years later at the same hour that Israel was signed in as a nation it's all connected together right we're getting to a point now he says the angel of the Lord is on earth now see is moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord amen you you may be asking the question who's these angels here he goes on it's the same angels that heard the sin when they went down to Sodom same Angels connected with our Prophet same angels are yet to connect with us amen and they said we have come down to see if these things be so and one Angel stayed with Abraham the elect Sodom was down there and lot was in Sodom and two angels went down and preached to them and brought that little byy group out sleeping virgin now somebody tell me who those two angels were one was Billy Graham and Oral Roberts right he says this Angels preached down there a modern Billy Graham and them pulled him out but the angel that stood with Abraham at his back turned to the tent Abraham where is your wife Sarah how do you know she was married how do you know that Abraham was married he asked him where's your wife how did he know her name she's in the tent behind you well I've made you a promise you see who the angel was I made you a promise I'm going to visit you according to the time of life Sarah is going to have this baby am I'm telling you you're going to have your baby that which the Lord has sown within you you are going to have your baby amen is it's the time of life amen amen you must bring forth the Life of Christ amen amen so he says here in 101 there after biligram received the Holy Ghost he could not come out into here you see these Messengers will be saved under their message you read what he's saying there after bully Graham received the Holy Ghost he could not come into the bride that's right into our message amen he could not come out into here that's his field down there and he recognizes it and God is hold him there ah why you don't bring him in Lord God is holding him there that's right with that intellectual preaching the thing that he hears here he's but he's trying to jerk out Sodom amen trying to jerk out to give Grace to that sleeping virgin but there was Abraham and his class and Jesus says As it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the days of the son of man so those angels will be here on Earth doing the same thing that's the reason bully goes to the Baptist and so forth has to Jack schula and those great men out there that's going the revivalist they have to because they jerking out you see that's why you don't find us going you may be wondering why we don't go out you can see how the prophet is detailing it he says they have a Ministry going out to the Baptist amen I don't know if any Baptist that will invite us he says men out there that's going the revivalist that they have to because they joking out they never done Miracles down there a few like people smoke blind but preaching the gospel smites them blind the Bible says so it says but to this fell out done the sign Supernatural sign to Abraham right now I need to read this because I need you to get this everyone paying attention amen amen so this is now the prophet going to tell you how the angel of God works so it's very important when you are prayed for when you're receiving something to wait for the moving of the Angel amen so I remember he prayed for these two women one had the growth and the other had the stomach trouble and he says I went down so there one woman is writing the story I went down to tell her what had happened when I got there she was screaming at the top of her voice the growth that left her throat what was it it was the angel of God passing through the neighborhood amen his Blessing had been pronounced sometimes they can't get to you just as they hello amen now can you imagine the angel of God coming by your house and your house is in chaos you're watching movies and you living ungodly and you got pop music playing there you young guys must get the pop music off your phone amen get those worldly music off your phone amen and the girls saying young guys young people amen can I hear the young people we need to watch what we listen to amen these years are holy they're anointed to listen to the word of God there are many gospel songs you can listen to amen the angel of God was passing through the neighborhood his Blessing had been pronounced sometimes they can't get to you just as they wish he says what was it the angel of God had seen a faith and was passing through the neighborhood confirming his word with signs and wonders there they was and these two women were just so happy rejoicing the other one had a female disc da said it struck her the same time Hallelujah you see how important it is thank you Lord when we leave here or nothing happened to me today in the service my faith got raised up one time and now I'm just the same and you go home and you're never in that atmosphere of Faith right uh you're coming with your isolated quotes here let's see if it's isolated I got an encouraging letter today that same that some lady probably is present now was telling me about some of the things that happened in our neighborhood yesterday after night before last meeting how the Lord restored hearing to a woman been totally deaf for a long time claim the angel of the Lord came into the house where she was at and gave her a hearing we would like to have a testimony to write it out back there that's very fine we're happy for that just very happy and then the prophet will go on to say how many remembers when Daniel the angel came to him 21 days he would stood you remember that Daniel Prayed but the angel said that he had trouble there and he couldn't get to him for 21 days after he made the prayer amen the angel could be down the road from you yes but fighting demonic Powers that's that's stopping them from coming into your house amen so you need to know how these things operate I told you we are sons of God angels and demon powers now locked up in spiritual warfare amen so Dan so don't be in a hurry amen just believe have faith and if you accept Jesus tonight as your healer have faith it's got to come to pass and there again he says and you know what it was it was the Ang of the Lord passing through that neighborhood of those things he had pronounced if he pronounces it it's his obligation not mine or yours see it's your obligation to Keep On Believing it's my obligation to stay and work with him it's your obligation to believe what he tells you and God will bring it to pass now they can't always answer spontaneously when Paul was out on the ocean that night and and 14 days and night without moon and stars while all hope was gone no hopes at all on the seen men with Barnacles on them almost they had been in Sea so long and all hopes is gone if they should ever live and Paul was down in the gallery and the angel of the Lord came to him he ran to the top of the deck and said be of good courage for the angel of God who servant I am stood by me and told me last night thank you amen amen it's sometimes things happen you don't even know yeah the prophet is confirming this now I want you to listen to me the last two nights I'll say this may God help me not to exaggerate but just to be honest as I believe from my heart from the pull of the strength that's taken from me in this meeting there's at Le two at least 200 people sitting here right now that's already healed you don't recognize it you just don't recognize it there's people here that I know is healed you'll see how many the crippled that's now that's here that's really crippled that's going to be well just as certain as anything they're going to get well they're going to be all right many of them there's some of them I see them there's some of them people yeah without trouble that's going to be all right some you with cancer that's going to be all right Hallelujah I don't if you believe you're going to be all right that it's already done has that been laid pretty good now am to see how the angel of the Lord comes through yes sir to perform the work here's the prophet in different messages telling you and these were people coming to tell him testimony the angel of the Lord was here in my house you see maybe maybe now we can learn how to phrase our testimonies because when you got healed you didn't just get healed somebody was there somebody came there and somebody touched you amen now you know to say the angel of the Lord visited me last night and IED my healing amen and I praise the Lord let's stand together give him a good hand clap of [Applause] Praise hallu amen hallelujah sons of God you need to connect with the angels of God they are also Fallen Angels here don't connect with them that's right you say how are they coming they're coming via the fourth dimension demonic influence coming to to corrupt minds of men oh praise the Lord hallelujah the angel of the Lord is here the angel of the Lord is here I can feel it in the atmosphere fear the angel of the Lord is here the angel of the Lord is here the angel of the Lord is here the angel of the Lord is here I can feel it in the atmosphere the angel of the Lord is here the angel of the Lord is here the power of the Lord is here the power of the Lord is here I can feel it in the [Music] atmosphere the power of the Lord is here the power of the Lord Lord
