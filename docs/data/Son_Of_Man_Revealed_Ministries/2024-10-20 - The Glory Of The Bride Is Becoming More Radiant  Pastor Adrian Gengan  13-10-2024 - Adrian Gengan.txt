morning amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord you know the prophet tells us that's what a trumpet does Amen praise the Lord causes religious disturbance amen amen and we haven't come to make Satan's life any easy Amen in fact we've come to blast him out of our Lives amen all unbelief all fear anxiety is gone amen so I greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah he is worthy to be praised amen God bless you brother B sisteron amen visiting with us I pray the Lord will bless you amen so this morning we're going to speak amen just for a title you know there's nothing to titles it's the Holy Ghost can speak different things I just TP things and the prophal things amen but I'd like to speak on the glory of the Bride is becoming more radiant hallah amen the glory of the Bride is becoming more radiant amen and what we were finding out amen even as we spoke on Wednesday Shak glory is veiled in you now yes there there's no denying it the veil has been taken off we don't speak in mystery anymore this is a time of manifestation amen amen at one time it was locked up in Hidden Mysteries but the prophet revealed those Mysteries and he left it to us to manifest so the glory of the Bride is becoming more radiant we'll start off there in Psalm 48:2 Psalm 48:2 praise the Lord amen it says great is the Lord and greatly to be praised amen amen if we have a great God we need a great Praise In the City of of our God now I want you to know I'm talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ here in the city of our God in the mountain of his Holiness beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth who's the joy is Mount Zion that's the Lamb's wife on the sides of the north so she's she's positioned strategically amen amen she's positioned on the sides of the north am man Hallelujah the city of the great king now who is the great king Psalm 24 says who is the king of glory amen amen he said God is known in our palaces for a refuge God is known in our palaces amen amen there's no room in our hearts that we have not unlocked to him amen so we our thought there was to get to the sides of the north to show you the bride's position strategically in Heavenly places then Isaiah 14 and13 we just want read that one point and notice how it is there in the 13th verse praise the Lord this we know Deception comes in the beast in the 13th chapter of Revelation it says for thou has said I will Ascend into heaven right the bride is in Heavenly places now I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north if you go do a search on that word sit it means to marry so like how he took Adam's wife he wants to make a move on this queen he says I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north amen the Lord had blessings to his reading of his word you may be seated amen praise the Lord so it's good to be fun in the house of the Lord amen and we had a wonderful time in the prayer meeting amen the all night prayer meeting and uh we had different pastors come through amen and they give tremendous testimonies amen of unity and the corridor being protected Hallelujah the Brotherly Love Philadelphia Corridor amen hallelujah and uh so we also have amen one testimony already out of that meeting and you know Sister Christina put up the prayer request on uh was it Wednesday you put it up or Thursday you put it Thursday and sister sodi was taken to hospital and you know she's been struggling with sugar diabetes and eye blood pressure and these things when it reaches a point you know when you get a a wound or a sore those things don't heal so she was taken to hospital amen and uh so brother subashan was away so Sister Christine asked the church to pray amen and then on Thursday evening I went to visit her at the hospital and uh she was very fearful you could see she was crying you know when she saw me she started to weep and cry and tell me what did Sin did she do in her life you know to deserve all of this but it was just out of the emotions amen so I waited for brother space and sister to leave and then I sat down there and I started to speak to her and I started to tell her that you need to have your faith in the word of God Amen there's no situation that's impossible I told of how God Jesus made a man's hand was withed to come forth and how he he healed the blinded eyes and he gave sight to the blind again amen and the healed the crippled and the lame amen and all manner of diseases so started to build a faith a bit amen and then uh made her confess things amen because we don't realize the power of our confession that we carry the authority on the earth spoken word must be restored to the bride amen we showed you amen how Adam lost his Dominion Adam had Dominion on the Earth but he lost his Dominion because he lost spoken word and when he lost spoken word he lost Fellowship because God can only fellowship with the word amen amen so he lost those three things Dominion he lost spoken word and he lost Fellowship praise the Lord so God to confess I reject anxiety I reject fear I reject stress I reject depression I reject any symptom you got to give Satan legal notice am because we carry the legal Authority but it's important for the person to confess it because that demon power is attached to that person illegally so that person has got a give it eviction notice amen so once that was done took it through the scripture amen 1 Peter 2:24 start to show how it was already taken care on the cross of Calvary and she's already healed amen so you can see her faith level was already increasing when I left there amen and then I told her we having the prayer meeting we're going to pray for you and then we came into the prayer meeting and that was one of our prayer points Amen to pray for sisteri and uh Hallelujah pray over that that sickness and that sore because so what happened was they left the form with it and they were going to amputate the leg they needed a sign because you know once it reaches a certain point it turns gang greine and I don't know what not I don't know the thing but they were going to amputate up until here okay so it was a serious thing so the brothers prayed all the brothers that were here know we prayed about it so we can't give you of War secrets that happens within the army so we'll just give you brief testimonies amen hallelujah so the Army don't discuss secret things that happen in in the Army but the civilian life can enjoy the victories of the army amen So Yesterday amen after we got home and Tred to get some rest only could get two hours rest but your body is not used to being sleeping in the day so only get like 2 hours rest and then we were back up amen but something is telling me phone sisteri phone sisteri now I've been learning how to deal with this voice that I hear you got to learn how to work with the spirit amen because sometimes you ignore it anything it's just me my conscience or something telling me so I said let me phone but the number she gave me the number off her head but I think she gave me the digits different we saw phone brother sub and he was still traveling back and then he gave me the right number then I found her and I said sister SOI you know we prayed for you what is your current situation she says well I'm still in hospital right now and if any of you want to go and visit her she's not there anymore just so you know she's been discharged amen praise the Lord so she's telling me and I couldn't hear the signal was cutting and I was getting frustrated you know when you can't hear something I was getting a bit frustrated so the car got cut and I found her back and then she moved to a place where I think you could hear better and then she says well the doctor came to examine me this morning and he looked at this wound and he said well there's no more need to amputate praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah and he says they are discharging me today oh thank you Jesus now I know I spoke to brother suban and he didn't tell me any of this thing so our pH brother subashan back and I said do you know your mother's being discharged today and he didn't even know anything but that's the power of God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus so all it's required is faith huj fa in the finished work amen nothing we do now manufacture but faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah how is brother Duncan doing he's he doing much better okay amen so I know that there the Lord has already done a work of healing there amen they wouldn't just distur you know he had heart attack and sister Maggie was saying how his heart was damaged on the front and the back that's was your words you told me amen then we started to pray I believe sister VI he also prayed over him at the hospital and things and so on Monday I believe Monday was he discharged Tuesday he got discharged and they gave him an appointment for next year is it next year now they don't do things like that if it's serious now it seems like it's hard to get proper testimonies but we'll take it if they don't want to come forth and testify what the Lord is doing amen it's fine but we know the victory is already won so I believe this you know there were so many prayers request that were coming we even got international prayer requests coming through and we were praying for these things lot of people crying out for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know all different areas of their lives amen so I believe those testimonies are going to come pouring through amen so we we we read here now so sorry I just remembered now I'm looking at the date and I realized it's Mom and it would been Pastor Ron's anniversary today am I right today is the 13th yep you don't even know your anniversary M but it will be in what 51 51 amen so we pray that the Lord will be with you amen so you know there's a I want to give you this quote because the prophet gave this quote and he talks about When a Man Loves a Woman and she really loves him and he really loves her he says they'll step into eternity together so your anniversary will not be forgotten it's an eternal Union amen so praise the Lord may the Lord bless you amen Hallelujah so we looking at these two scriptures I just want to remind you what we read Mount Zion is on the sides of the north the bright strategic position if you want to know in the spiritual realm where you are seated you are seated on the sides of the North in the kingdom of God therefore you find Satan having a desire to come to the sides of the north and sit upon the Mount of the congregation he wants to invade this Army so there is an invading Army coming under the fourth seal we know that amen to kill with sword famine and beast of the earth and we know that the rider on the horse is called death and Hell Followed him praise the Lord but God will not be defeated and I want to read Joel chapter 2 now let's read Joel chapter 2 from verse 19 yeah the Lord will answer say unto his people behold I will send you corn wine and oil meaning the famine is over the famine for the bride is over if you're going to get corn which means you already possessed the land you planted and you are now going to eat of the land praise the Lord so he's sending corn wine and oil and you shall be satisfied there with and I will no more make you a reproach among the ethen but I will remove far off from you the Northern Army oh there's that that Army is coming to the north but the Lord is saying I will remove the northern army that army that has come to sit upon the congregation I am going to remove that Army I will remove the northern Army and will drive them into a land Barren praise the Lord and desolate with his face towards the east sea amen amen so Satan is going to run into barness his army is going to run into baroness yes yes hallelujah how are they fruitful when they possess your body that's right but you're going to drive them out and drive them to barness amen we got to keep reading amen and is hind the part toward the uttermost sea and his stink shall come up and Ill Savor shall come up because he had done great things praise the Lord fear not Oh Land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things be not afraid he beast of the field for the pastures of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beareth of fruit and the Fig Tree and the vine do heal their strength so the Lord is showing you there's going to be a richness and an harest coming through praise the Lord he says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given you the former rain moderate ly and will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain Amen in the first month so we find if there's two rains there's got to be an overflow praise the Lord and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the Vets shall overflow amen with wine and oil amen we know what the wine and the oil represent amen and the Bride of Jesus Christ is living in an overflow of oil and wine amen the stimulation of Revelation and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah we don't just have the word only but we have the spirit as well amen we have the refilling of the Holy Ghost AM amen I'm going to read that again because I want to show you that the bride is living in an abundance now the message of the hour gave us an abundance amen a storage house amen of meal amen for us to eat our floor is full of Wheat and our vets are overflowing with oil and wine and I will restore to you the years that the Locust had eaten and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you so what he's saying I'm whatever you [Music] lost I am going to restore amen I don't care how how far Satan is has taken your children amen you bring them under the blood he says to you your children and your children's children so even cover your grandchild thank you Lord amen thank you Lord and you shall eat in plenty oh yes and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that he had dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed praise the Lord amen so what we are finding here that the Shak glory is going to be emanating from a people we know at one time the sh of Glory was reserved for the holiest of holies hallelujah amen praise the Lord and nobody could get behind there but the priest the high priest amen and they experien a sh of Glory but God did away with that first temple the veil was torn amen there at Calvary then we know there kind of glor Glory was in Jesus Christ amen but now the kind of Glory has moved be skin be your skin yes amen the Bible declares there in in the book of Gideon and in one translation it says that God veiled himself with Gideon God veiled himself with Gideon amen and you know the prophet would say that God veiled himself in Moses and God veiled himself to the prophets and God veiled himself in Jesus Christ they couldn't see past the human Veil he says hallelujah and then so he began to clothe himself with Gideon he began to that's how the power of God Came Upon them he began to clothe himself he clothed himself with William brandom Luke 17:30 a son of man revealing the son of man that the people couldn't recognize and differentiate between the ministry they asked him are you Jesus Christ why he clothed himself amen praise the Lord amen and you know Revelation 10 says he clothed himself with a cloud those seven angels became israil yes and they brought the Revelation he says night after night those angels met me in the room and they gave me the revelation of that Seven Seals praise the Lord so so he was unveiling himself the mystery so I'm showing you now that he's now clothing himself with you amen oh but that's hard to believe but if you understand Christ The Mystery of God revealed the second full mystery purpose is to have full expression through his people then you've got to believe that he has clothed himself with you you carry the sh of Glory within you but that's the Revelation Satan will deceive you to say it can't be so but you got to take the word to the mind and defeat him in the mind and tell him it is so it is in the word amenallah so right now the Shan glory is in your Tabernacle in each one of you sh glory is emanating from within you the glory of the Lord in the body of Christ you become the dwelling place of the most high Psalm 46:5 says God is in the midst of her amen as we learn to submit to the Holy Spirit we learn obedience through suffering amen through our experiences we are healing ourselves through the spirit We are Becoming hungry and crying out in desperation now you can read Colossians 1: 26- 28 there it it says that and you know this is a scripture the prophet took to preach Christ is a mystery amen and he's talking about a Divine mystery in that chapter and he's talking about a a a secret that's been concealed from before the foundation of the world and he's saying it's now being revealed and unfolded and manifested in every believer's life amen that Christ is now living within you and he floods your soul with joy he floods your soul with expectation of glory amen the mystery of Christ has become embedded within us if anyone wants to know the mystery of Christ amen that mystery is now embedded in the bride amen hallelujah amen allow me to dramatize this for a moment amen yeah right now all seven Church age Messengers with the groups of people are gathered there beyond the curtain of timeall amen and I want you to know the book that Adam lost his authority his legal rights over the Earth that book was taken back to the original owner amen amen I want you to know that that book has come back on the earth that's what Revelation 10 is describing because in Revelation 5 the lamb takes the book from the orig owner and then he starts to break those seals and in Revelation 10 he's bringing back man's legal authority to the Earth he's bringing back a Dominion he's bringing back the title deed to the Earthen hallelujah praise the Lord how many of you know something else went back to the original owner brother Bram says it this way when Jesus Christ's blood was shed on Calvary your sin was taken away and it went back to the original owner am whatever sin Satan dumped on you it went back to the original owner meaning you are sinless you are spotless you are The Virtuous Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you Lord thank you amen sin came from him so it must go back to him praise the Lord amen so we're finding here that the book has come back to the original owner and if you read Revelation 10 there is a group of people represented by John who have the book now we can detail the book and tell you that in the book has names amen the lamp section of the book of life as the spiritual Gene of God all the names written down so if a people now have taken that book and they have eaten that book they asked to prophesy again meaning they asked to call those names in the book amen that's what your prophecy is doing calling those names in the book your prophecy amen is just not a a normal prophetic word like the denominational world but your preaching is to germinate the C genene of God within the heart of man so allow me to dramatize this amen here what happened six Church ages had passed and you find amen that church age Messengers are gathered there beyond the curtain of time and here comes brother brandham and he he lays out his message but in 1965 the Lord takes him home and there's a welcoming party for him there amen amen all the same Saints are rejoicing to see him they know that this man was the seventh angel and they know that this man was on the earth at the time amen of the coming of Revelation 10 to bring the title deed back on the earth praise the Lord so all of them excited amen Paul amen can you imagine when Paul got there to that Dimension how the Saints must have rejoiced the Old Testament Saints must have been rejoicing how Steven must have ran to Paul and said you were standing there to watch them Stone me but Paul I'm so glad to see you made it I'm so glad you're a predestinated seed amen Paul and Paul and amen Steven must have hugged they must have been rejoicing praise the Lord thank you Lord and Paul must have been saying I preach Christ is a mystery I preached the mystery amen being revealed in a people and he said but I preached and I told the people that I see through a glass Darkly I don't have the full understanding amen sir amen so on and on can you imagine when irenius came and Martin and Columba and all of them came they into that Dimension when I'm talking about when their lives were finished on the earth and they had passed over to the other side each one Paul must have been asking irenius do you have the [Music] book irus must have asked Cola do you have the book and each one is saying no amen so when all six Church age messenger is there now Luther and Wesley are there this Luther says I just had one work of Grace justification Wesley comes through and he says I just had another work of Grace sanctification I don't have the book can you me when brother Brandon gets there amen amen the one that held the mystery amen the one that revealed the mystery and they asked him they all come running brother Brandon do you have the book and brother Bram says I had it but I don't where's the book he says well if you w looking for the book you got to look beyond the curtain there look down to the corridor of time the book is on the earth thank you Lord the book is in a people amen hallelujah that is like the weal Revival you can't see a physical book but I am the book amen you can't see the Holy Ghost but I am the Holy Ghost amen yes thank you Lord oh that's a deep Revelation amen come on swallow swallow swallow when the Holy Ghost possesses your life amen he takes control of your body you become the embodiment of the Holy Ghost meaning you live you breathe you act amen your eyes become the eyes of the Holy Ghost your ears become the ears of the Holy Ghost your feet become the feet of the Holy Ghost amen yes Lord thank you praise the Lord but people don't like the Holy Ghost praise the Lord amen I want you to know when the prophet saw the bride he saw a preview of the bride and he first he saw the Glorious church then he saw the deceived Church come up but then amen hallelujah it says I saw the group come up again dressed exactly like the first group amen hallelujah praise the Lord and Ephesians 5 says he is presenting the church to himself a glorious Church Without spot without blemish without wrinkle amen so Through Time we find that God was unfolding his Redemption plan Hallelujah and that was Kept Secret in the back part of God's mind and he did not reveal it to anyone at any time but he unfolded it by making his plan come to pass I'm paraphrasing a lot of Christ The Mystery of God is revealed you can read it for yourself but when our lord Jesus came as Redeemer he was unfolding God's Plan of Redemption God was fully being expressed through Jesus Christ as Redeemer as Savior as healer praise the Lord thank you Lord and Jesus bear our sin on the cross you can put up 1 Peter 2:24 there amen it was a Divine exchange I've tell you I've seen more miracles and healings using this one scripture because it contains in it the old Plan of Salvation it says here who in his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness I don't every one he if you are in Jesus Christ I don't every one hear you saying you're a sinner Hall you don't have sin amen the blood of Jesus Christ completely annihilated sin thank you it's a Divine exchange you are dead to sin that's why I didn't like it there brother s when they kept coming they spoke more about you prior your conversion at your birthday but Brother s is born again thank you he passed sins are forgotten but you see that's what Satan will do they'll remind you of your past but why didn't we concentrate this man since he's been changed since he's been born again he's been a rugged soldier in the field of Christ winning many souls to Christ he's a Fearless warrior in the Kingdom amen yes should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes you were healed amen it's a finished work yes this scripture here cripples the enemy because it's pack with tr so when you present this scripture to a sick person to a person Bound by sin chains break am amen you say why don't you quote Isaiah 53 Isaiah 53 is I love Isaiah 53 brother brandom says you can personalize it he was wounded from my transgression but remember that is prophecy speaking about someone to come yes sir I just like this scripture by whose Stripes you were were healed finished work complete short 1 Peter 2:24 amen by whose Stripes you were healed finished work so at no other time he the statement now I don't think you got it when I said it the last time throughout all of history of man in no other time was the full word of God revealed to any other age the fullness of the word was only revealed through the seventh Angel's message yes he had the word to Quicken your SE Gene within you and to for the Holy Ghost to birth you to life and now that we know the Holy Ghost is bringing Sons to adoption sons that can handle the father's business amen and I want us to really understand that God has not called us here to church religionallah that's right if you follow the story of adoption when the son is adopted he the purpose of adoption is for the son to handle the father's business amen and Jesus had just attend age of 12 he told Mary don't you know I must be about my father's business I'm asking you whose business are you concerning yourself with amen we should be concerned about the father's business than you Lord so if we are saying we are coming into adoption and we are reaching adoption we must he doesn't call us to adoption for us to remain quiet we must take control of dominion and principalities and powers and rulers of Darkness he says the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence and must now go and take it back sons who come into adoption they must handle the father's business he says they can speak like the father they can sign like the father who they fire is fired and who they hire is hired whatever you bind on Earth is bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth is loose in Heaven Come on spiritual Sons and Daughters of God awaken to your full potential we are living beneath our privileges because Satan is keeping us deceived to think that Those portions are not opened up to us I say it's opened up to us amen every promise is open up unto us amen we are thinking that there's a further work of redemption to bring us when Jesus Christ died on the cross I'll show you just now brother Bron says everything that Adam lost is restored to the church but it's Satan's job to deceive you it's Satan's job to make you concerned with the cares of this life it's Satan's job to make you busy praise the Lord so I'm saying if you're a Son of God if you're a daughter of God you must now engage in the father's business you may be unemployed here in the natural life in the father's Kingdom there is no unemployment amen yes there is zero unemployment in the father his kingdom praise the Lord amen and there is also no pay because you have full access to the Royal Grant if you have full access to the Royal Grant why would you require a salary you can just go and take as much as you need amen amen in the father's Kingdom there's no Medical Aid because he's got Miracle Aid amen there's no insurance policy because he's given us Assurance hallelujah amen benefits are out of this world amen hallelujah amen glory be to his name amen so I want you to know that the fullness of the word has been revealed to us and do we realize that we as the Bride of Jesus Christ are the only people on the face of the Earth that are believing the entire word am if you don't believe that go Fellowship somewhere else in your denomination the only people on the face of the Earth that believe the entirety of the word amen is the people called by the message of the hour under Malachi 4:5 and 6 and Revelation 10:7 amen why so that gives a bright special quality amen it makes her believe it because she's a c Gene of God a potential is to believe the fullness of the word and it's going to give a perfect faith rapturing faith amen praise the Lord amen let's let's move on Amen praise the Lord if we can read 2 Corinthians chapter 3 we were talking about this Veil and here the Apostle Paul is talking about it he says whenever the Old Testament was read but even we'll read from verse 16 or 15 let's read 15 but even unto this day when Moses is read talking about the Old Testament books there the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away okay now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen yes but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord you know what he's saying when you are looking at yourself in the mirror you must see the glory of God yes the glory of God when you look into the word you see yourself he's saying that when we are looking the glass he's talking about like a mirror when we look with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image amen so whose image are we beholding amen Christ has come to Plain View Hallelujah we are looking at the word and what he saying canot paraphrase it and say he's saying We are Becoming like Jesus that what we are looking at We are Becoming like him I changed into the same image from glory to glory as even as by the spirit of the Lord amen now who you would bear record with me and say that the glory is becoming more expressed in me amen that what started out in the beginning of the year as a as a thought in infancy is now coming into a full grown image and stature of a perfect man amen that soon this body can continue amen and you are in your Enoch walk now you are in your perfect walk now come on things of God must be believe by faith you are in your Enoch walk now as Enoch built a physical pyramid there you are building a pyramid City within yourself hallah you are building faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity has come to cap you off you are building a pyramid City God is building a pyramid City within you and one of these days the atoms of these bodies can't hold you down because of the word that you carry amen this elements of this world can't contain the God man within you that you will burst forth from these atoms than now if you would say that you are depending on God how many of you are depending on God nobody is depending on God here how many of you are depending on God we depend on him for daily things but if I told you God is depending on you as well what would you say what the god of the universe the great Creator would depend on me let's go to that first quote and see that you become an integral part of redemption's plan amen I want you to also be very observant and notice that angels were asked to hold back the winds from blowing right that winds wind means SWS and strife but can you see some winds coming through which means if those angels are loosening those grips and some of those winds are starting to come through the bride can't be on the earth at that time he doesn't work with the Jew and the Gentile at the same time so meaning they will require Angelic assistance like how Joshua got Angelic assistance the captain of the host came down praise the Lord so one of two things will happen here if God is going to give an extended period of Grace then Trump will be president I'm saying extended period of Grace for the Gentiles because he will back them up but if not then I'm saying you better check if your lamp is stmed and burning if not because there's no way you can see all nations of the Earth are going to turn against the right even now you heard that they struck a military Point amen and I believe it was UN Mission going there so now they even more up in arms praise the Lord so soon they will turn and you know that's prophecy the prophet prophesied that once that the they signed that agreement the money proposition right then you know they break the Covenant praise the Lord so I'm saying we are living in crucial hours right now if youve ever heard about a Rapture spoken about a Rapture body change and God coming back this is what we are talking about amen maybe you were asleep all these years but get ready get ready so God is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit and now if he's depending on you let's open up our channels and let the Holy Spirit Come into tonight and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts Revival has [Music] come amen notice and I I tell you do this because Satan can come in with doubts and fear say I reject doubt I reject fear just speak those words those demons will leave yes and sometimes if those demons can't possess you the prophet says they are spirits hanging over you they come to to cause that uneasiness you feel that heaviness he says the spirit hanging over you he's Discerning the audence I see a spirit hanging over you so they know they can't enter you you don't have legal Authority okay so they come to over around right come to whisper but the suban was telling me that there while his mother was sleeping in the bed there was another lady there on the other side telling her ah this thing is nothing just sign the paper and by the way he just told me now before the service that on Friday his mother did sign the paper for the amputation because of influence right but we thank God Amen that the prayers have intervened amen hallelujah so I'm saying look at the influence now but the suent said that lady was sitting sleeping on the other side of the bed and said I've been for a couple of these it's nothing just do it you see demon powers want you to join their ranks right you don't join their ranks for nothing you don't give up yes amen amen we must be bold Warriors now come let's move quickly amen now I want to bring this because I want to show you how powerful you are on the earth I want to show you that God is depending on you and everyone is in in a battle for your spirit and your soul and for your access to your body is what I'm trying to say he says remember Devils never die Devils always live but there will be a time when Devils will have to die they will be become totally annihilated but now they are alive and they work from generation to generation upon human beings some of them is in the form of cancer some in the form of epilepsy some in the form of tuberculosis they get into the flesh but seemingly they are powerless until they can get into a person right where they must be in a person now remember he's a counterfeit what God is trying to achieve is get into a person he wants to achieve that now listen how he brings his thought about the Holy Spirit now they have to operate through a person so all Spirit beings must operate through a person otherwise they are powerless on the earth because God made man to have dominion on the earth amen everybody understand that the prophet's going to clarify this now which brings to another thought that the Holy Spirit covers the earth but is almost helpless until it gets into you and me amen so who can render the Holy Ghost powerless You and Me by not allowing him access to our bodies to our spirits to our souls he says the holy spirit that covers of the earth is almost helpless until it can get into you and me God is depending on you and I the Holy Spirit the Earth is full of the spirit of God but it's poured out it cannot operate until it comes into us we human beings to operate yes why God won't violate his own word he said you'll be God of the earth man you'll have dominion on the earth I'll be God of the heavens we know that Psalm 115 there amen when God said in Genesis 1: 126 I'll make man in my image and 27 he says he created man in His image and he said you shall have dominion on the earth God won't violate his own word so if he wants to do anything on the earth he will always work through a man that's why you find from Genesis he always tried to connect with a man amen Abraham Noah all of these things to do things on the earth everybody's understanding this point God won't violate his word he's got to work through a man the prophet says God's agency is man he won't work outside of man he don't use Mechanical Devices like tapes and books and all of these things he uses man to preach the gospel he said he could have chosen the Sun the moon the stars he could have chosen the animals but he chose man amen yes thank you Lord now I ask you to so and think about that have you allowed the Holy Ghost full access or are you rendering him powerless in your life very important God is depending on you and I the whole earth is full of the spirit of God but it's poured out but it cannot operate until it comes into us we human beings to operate and the devil wants to take us over to operate under him you see contest for you you you become the most valuable prize on the earth Prophet says your soul is worth 10,000 worlds so when he gets the mild form he starts in sin if he can get him in just a righteous man a good man and just let him go ahead and try to be good like that and that's the condition of message people don't worry in the message you believe the prophet I if you can tap yourself don't you're good nothing else for you to do that's why most people's expectation is still looking and being warmed by a painted fire 60 years ago amen they want brother Brandon to do everything for them there's nothing for you to do what did Satan do deceived you he deceived you yeah the prophet of God is saying this he wants to take all of a righteous man good man just let him go ahead and try to be good like that you see if you can get all of him like that until he's dead so don't get caught up in deception remember the deception he says is if he when you realize who you are recognize who you are what you can do that you can do the Greater Works then he becomes powerless so the deception is going to come right there to make you think you're in the message you're believing the truth you you know God sent a prophet you're fine but there's no power of the Holy Ghost in your life am I am I making this up he's the prophet saying it he'll keep you in a good religious form until you are dead that's just what he wants to do he's got him because no matter how righteous you are how good you are how moral you are how clean you are how honest you are you will never get to Heaven until you're born again am Hallelujah right Jesus said so you've got to be regenerated right well we got to get back Yonder when our forefathers got it you see Satan always trying to keep you looking backwards amen he says we can say to the Pentecostal Brethren well what we got back Yonder when our forefathers got it 50 years ago don't never look backward my message to the message church is don't ever look backward God is always Progressive amen yes keep looking forward he says science even Don't Look Backwards they're always looking to explore new things science is going to find God before the preacher does if we don't watch it he says that scientists has taken man more into higher Realms of the spirit than preachers have taken them right why they are tapping into spiritual laws sign some 300 years ago French scientist if a person could get a terrific speed of 35 M hour he thought that was great he says but they didn't stop there you think modern science would listen to that certainly not he's going 2,000 M an hour now and he's not even stopping at that he's going on and we try to look back and see what somebody else said oh Church let's wake [Music] up amen just want to reiterate you what we said earlier he says all things are possible to them that believe we've got the untapped resources of God at our ends to display God Amen Hallelujah yes sir now if if there's a resource it must come from a source right and our source is Aba ABA father ABA father has given us Kingdom resources but they untapped now listen to what he's saying because healing is tapped he was operating in healing salvation is tapped these are resources but they are untapped how to operate in the spiritual Dimension how to connect with the angel of God untapped resources are you following me we got the untapped resources of God at our hand to display God we are Sons and Daughters of God God made man he made him a God he gave him dominion over the Earth but his Fallen estate dropped that but what they lost by Adam it was restored by Christ amen yes l so I'm saying wake up Satan is lying to you tell him you are back in the image again amen amen hallelujah you are coming into the likeness of Jesus Christ amen nothing can hold you back right now nothing should be able to stop you we should be the mightiest Army on the Earth right now we should be the most powerful Church on the Earth right now Sons and Daughters of God awaken amen amen amen and the glory is becoming more radiant in The Bride As She's Awakening amen the kind of Glory is pouring in and pouring in and pouring In Praise the Lord straight after that he goes to Mark 11:23 I'm telling you this is the main scripture to get you back to your position this is how Adam operated amen if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart yes sir but believe what you have said not think what you have said shall come to pass you can have what you've said all things whatsoever you desire When you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it He restored to us all that was lost in Adam so I want you to go make a claim to the enemy and if he says no no shut up I have been restored to all things but of course the things of God must be believed by faith he says but today what we think we're going to church putting he says let's move past this now I'm trying to read what he's saying don't put your name on the book don't be must sprinkled whatever it is shake hands with with the congregation with the pastor and think that settles it he says we come up to Pentecost receive the Holy Ghost it fell upon us we began shouting praising God power of God come down spoke in tongues heard them interpret them make great pations so forth prophecies that sounds fine but we just stop that's just the beginning keep moving on Amen keep moving on and on God is depending on us oh we receive the opening of the word all Mysteries are revealed that's not it keep moving on there's a reason why those Mysteries came the seals were open so Sons could come to manifestation so that Romans 8 could be fulfilled amen there must be a move of God Amen and unless we recognize that we are called for this purpose for this in this hour amen nothing will move we've got to recognize and step up to our god-given potentials amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen let's get to the next quote not that one there not the one that says son born in the home not the sweetest words in the Bible the next one and remember God Amen praise the Lord yeah this one this is what we're getting to now and remember God is looking to me to see that I stay in the word and I'm looking to you to see that you carry out the word so received the Revelation and one must do the manifestation praise the Lord and keep it spiritual remember all the forces of the dark kingdom of Satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow in the Lord remember what we read in the opening scripture is there's an invading Army coming to the sides of the north the dark kingdom of Satan will be turned against you and you must be soldiers amen not just fresh recruits amen your aged soldiers now and being trained to fight am and Satan will come among you and cause you to dispute with one another if he can how can he do it if we allow him he's saying if he can turn him down just immediately you're Brethren and it's the enemy and we here to hold a standard in the evening light time when the world is darkened and the whole church Kingdom is going into the Council of churches and pretty soon they'll take a sign on the door here closed you know most message people think that's when it's going to end that a church will be closed and we won't be able to meet but watch his next statement and will meet other places you can't stop this bright from Gathering because it says forsake not the assembling together of ourselves some people can't wait for them to take that sign they don't like to come to church you say Hey Now government said you can't go Church against the law to go church he says yeah and they're going to have to meet other places cuz they'll certainly close these churches one of these days if we don't take the mark of the beast and we're depending on staying true to god Till Death sets us free and that's what we intend to do praise the Lord amen so what is Christ wanting to do now he wants to have the preeminence in you amen hallelujah let's get to paragraph there 143 we know he love fatherhood he was a father he could express himself through a son I'm trying to get to a purpose here one of his great three four purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in people it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me Galatians 2:20 and the faith that I now have is the faith of the Son of God Amen now how could he do that in Adam and Eve but soon separated them now there had to be some way to get it back again revealing himself revealing himself in Christ and then bring that fullness of the goded bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight and the leading or if you get in prison then that's when he can express the [Music] this is currently where we are we are we are between the second and the third one right now to have the preeminence so he can restore the kingdom you're going to see effects of the Kingdom being restored on the earth before you leave the Earth hello you are going to see effects of the Kingdom being restored in your your Dominion Authority and the power of the spoken word and all of these things unlocked to you amen cuz his bride will be on display praise the Lord so what are we doing right now we are losing our mind to take on the mind of Christ thank you Lord some of us can say I've lost my mind and I have the mind of Christ praise the Lord amen hallelujah so what is the Holy Ghost doing now the Holy Ghost is either your life-giving Source or it's becoming a stumbling block to you amen praise the Lord let's read let's read this last one as we close now 375 and through that purpose he achieved a church that the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in the last days when he gets the pinenes pinenes in the church the position his place in the church then straight he goes to scripture he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also even more than this shall he do for I go to my father straight away he's putting the responsibility on you as soon as Christ gets his position he wants you to operate scripture can you see what the prophet is doing there as soon as he tells you what's Christ doing now he's telling you the scripture to manifest The Works that I do even Greater Works than these shall he do that was his purpose there was the manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody that can see it so they can let the word that's the same as it is today the stumbling block so brother Bram was talking about how Noah was building the ark and he says that Noah's preaching and you know no evidence of rain became a stumbling block but he said he continued to build but he says that's the same as it is today the stumbling block the holy spirit that is making the world where they don't want it the thing that they are turning down is the very that will take them up in the church so the thing that Noah was building is a thing that was going to save them so the holy ghost that is sent to build the church they don't want the Holy Ghost but it's the one that sent to take them away that's what the prophet is trying to convey them hallelujah amen what is it the quickening power coming to the church making a ready this hour that we approaching placing a son taking out in a certain place have a ceremony before angels and place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority we're closing now let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this night on the very same thing I'm speaking of will be done that's a prophetic word am there'll be power put into the church yes you know you can tie that with another quote about how National Force put Israel in a Homeland he says the power of God will put the church in the bride there'll be a power put into the church and now he's coming in that the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word it will create itself right there amen thank you Lord oh thank you we haven't seen Powers like this coming into the church now I know it for effect straight away now watch when he when he puts you in a promise and an expectation a prophetic word he always accompanies you with scripture I just showed you that now here's another scripture now he puts Mark 11:23 there brother Caleb say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart believe what You' said shall come to pass you can have what you've said the placing of the church in position so Mark 11:23 is for Place Sons where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then critic's mouth will be shut it'll be a short time I believe now we in that short time Jesus come right off the mountain went straight to Calvary notice Brothers it won't last long so we got to take now while we can it won't last long but it'll be there I if you say it's here let's stand together give God praise Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory amen his glory is becoming more radiant in US amen we are experiencing this we are living in it living in the Holy [Music] Ghost amen praise the Lord let's sing amen praise the Lord his glory is being manifested through his people thank you Jesus now we've got to give him access to our bodies we showed you how the Holy Ghost can become powerless if you don't allow full access to your body young man what are you doing you're not giving Holy Ghost access what's the matter young woman what are you doing you were designed and created to be a temple of the Living God why are you giving your best years to the enemy surrender now stop playing church and get that religious spirit off of you don't think you are fine religion will kill you yes right what we need is to lose Pride amen thank you Lord Pride will hinder you from conviction Pride will hinder you from repentance right now but if you could just soften your heart now to the Holy Spirit and say Lord in some way maybe I've restricted the flow of the holy ghost in my life maybe I've been rebellious I've been rebellious to Authority I've been rebellious to your word I've been rebellious to Powers I've been rebellious I haven't arked unto your word Lord I've allowed sin to dominate my life amen some of you are allowing pornography to govern you and ruin your life young men don't get caught up in pornography don't get caught up in in worldliness and entertainment say holy ghost S me I give you full access now remember I'm teaching you these things and I want you to apply these principles you need to start to speak it with your own mouth Satan I don't give you any power over my life I reject all your advances towards me I see your plan you're trying to sit on the sides of the north you're trying to get me into an adulterous relationship with you you're trying to get me to be unfaithful to my marriage vows I want you to know my womb is sealed I will not accept your [Music] advances I'm onward bound while the Holy Spirit is brooding [Music] now let him bro over your heart you know way where places you've shut him out
