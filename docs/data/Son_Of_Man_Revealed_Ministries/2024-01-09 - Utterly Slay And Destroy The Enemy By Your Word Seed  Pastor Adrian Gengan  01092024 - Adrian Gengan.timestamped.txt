[0:00] let's give the Lord a good anap of
[0:01] praise God is great and greatly to be
[0:03] praised this morning amen hallelujah
[0:06] amen so we were dealing on the opening
[0:08] up of spiritual Frontiers and we know
[0:10] that we are not in an ordinary time in
[0:12] season there's a frontier that's been
[0:14] open to us a new land been open to us
[0:17] under the seventh seal amen hallelujah
[0:19] so we want to take back everything that
[0:22] belongs to us amen amen so we'll turn to
[0:24] 1 Samuel chapter 30 this morning praise
[0:27] the
[0:28] Lord
[0:31] amen our God is good amen our god is
[0:35] awesome amen 1 Samuel chapter 30
[0:39] amen we'll read a portion of scripture
[0:41] and then we'll be seated then we'll
[0:43] continue reading
[0:47] amen now this is David's final battle
[0:51] before Saul is killed and you know once
[0:53] Saul is killed he's going to be stated
[0:55] as king amen so it's his one of his last
[0:58] battles that he's fighting before he
[1:00] becomes king and it came to pass when
[1:03] David and his men were come to zlac on
[1:06] the third day that the amalekites had
[1:09] invaded the South and
[1:12] Zig and smitten Zig and burnt it with
[1:18] fire now what what a reception to come
[1:20] to you're out in battle you're coming
[1:22] home to your family you're coming home
[1:24] to see them and you find the city burned
[1:27] with fire not only that and had taken
[1:30] the woman
[1:33] captive that were therein and slew not
[1:35] any even great or small but carried them
[1:38] away and went on their
[1:41] way so David and his men came to the
[1:44] city and behold it was burnt with fire
[1:46] and their wives and their sons and their
[1:48] daughters were taken
[1:51] captives
[1:53] amen then David's and the people that
[1:56] were with him lifted up their voice and
[1:59] wept until they had no more power to
[2:03] weep so this was no ordinary thing this
[2:06] really affected the men how can their
[2:09] woman they were going out to battle to
[2:11] form a protection over them but while
[2:14] fighting the battle the enemy had
[2:15] slipped in
[2:16] an burned the city and taken them
[2:21] captive and David's two wives were taken
[2:25] captives a Noam the jezrael itis and
[2:28] Abigail the wife of nabal the
[2:31] calite amen praise the
[2:34] Lord Abigail means my father's Joy so
[2:38] they took away David's Joy there and we
[2:40] know that the joy of the Lord is our
[2:42] strength Wednesday night we were
[2:44] speaking on out to have to your faith
[2:46] virtue which is strength power amen I
[2:50] can do all things through Christ who
[2:52] gives me strength praise the
[2:54] Lord and David was greatly distressed
[2:57] for the people spake of stoning him
[3:00] because the soul of all the people was
[3:02] grieved every man for his sons and for
[3:05] his daughters but David encouraged
[3:08] himself in the Lord is God amen amen so
[3:12] you got to have a word within you to be
[3:13] able to encourage yourself yes amen
[3:16] nobody else is coming to offer
[3:17] encouragement they want to kill
[3:19] him and David said to abatha the priest
[3:23] am son I pray thee bring me either the
[3:27] he and ABA brought to of the eph for to
[3:31] David and David inquired at the Lord
[3:34] shall I pursuit after the
[3:38] tro shall I overtake them and he
[3:41] answered him pursue for Thou shalt
[3:45] surely overtake them and without fail
[3:48] recover all amen yes Lord that's the
[3:51] word of the Lord David can go out with
[3:53] an assurance he's going to recover all
[3:55] you may be seated the Lord at blessings
[3:57] to the reading of his word
[3:59] amen praise the Lord
[4:05] amen just to catch David's thoughts in
[4:08] the Psalms if you can go to Psalm 35
[4:11] regarding this and we'll see how David
[4:14] was engaged in battle and what he really
[4:17] did here when he
[4:18] prayed amen Psalm 35 if you can go to it
[4:22] you know David wrote Psalms regarding
[4:24] his life's journey and the battles he
[4:26] was facing praise the Lord amen
[4:32] we'll read here when he's when he's
[4:33] Consulting the Lord he says plead my
[4:36] cause oh Lord with them that strive with
[4:38] me fight against them that fight against
[4:41] me take hold of shield and Buckler and
[4:45] stand up for my help draw out th the
[4:48] spear and stop the way against them that
[4:50] persecute me say unto my soul I am thy
[4:54] salvation Amen Let Them Be confounded
[4:56] and put to shame that seek after my soul
[4:59] let them be turned back and brought to
[5:01] confusion that devis my
[5:03] hurt now I pray that you're not just
[5:06] thinking about David I'm talking about
[5:07] the demon powers that have been
[5:09] Unleashed upon the Earth that are P that
[5:11] amen that want to come out to you that
[5:13] want to cause you arm he says let them
[5:15] be as shf before the wind and let the
[5:18] angel of the Lord chase them amen now
[5:20] you remember last week's service seen
[5:22] and unseen worlds our strategic Alliance
[5:25] yeah with the Unseen World yes right so
[5:29] watch what Avid is
[5:30] praying send the angel of the Lord to
[5:33] chase them Hallelujah yes now if David
[5:35] can commission that how about Sons and
[5:38] Daughters of God who been filled with
[5:39] the Holy
[5:41] Ghost let their way be dark and slippery
[5:44] and let the angel of the Lord persecute
[5:46] them amen thank you for without cause
[5:50] they have hit for me their net in a
[5:53] pit which without cause they have died
[5:56] for my soul let Destruction come upon
[5:59] him at unawares and let his net that he
[6:02] had he catch himself in that very
[6:04] destruction let him
[6:06] fall and my soul shall be joyful in the
[6:09] Lord it shall rejoice in his salvation
[6:12] all my bones shall say Lord who is like
[6:14] unto thee who deliveres the poor from
[6:17] him that is too strong for him y the
[6:20] poor and the needy for him that spoiled
[6:22] him false Witnesses did rise up they
[6:25] laid to my charge things that I knew not
[6:28] they rewarded me evil for good to the
[6:30] spoiling of my soul but as for me when
[6:33] they were sick my clothing was
[6:36] sacko I humbled my soul with fasting and
[6:39] my prayer returned into my own bosom I
[6:42] behave myself as though he had been my
[6:44] friend or
[6:46] brother I bowed down heavily as one that
[6:48] mourned for his mother but in but in my
[6:51] adversity they rejoiced and gather
[6:54] themselves together yay the objects
[6:56] gathered themselves together against me
[6:58] and I knew it not they did tear me and
[7:00] cease not for the
[7:02] OCR
[7:05] OC for some reason I can't say this word
[7:08] because I don't know if there's
[7:08] Hypocrites sitting
[7:10] here hypocritical mockers in Feast they
[7:14] nest upon me with their teeth Lord how
[7:16] long will thou look on Rescue my soul
[7:19] from their destructions my darling the
[7:22] lions from the Lions see he's talking
[7:25] about his darling from the Lions I will
[7:27] give thanks in the great congregation I
[7:29] will praise the among much people okay
[7:31] so David goes on and you can continue to
[7:34] read
[7:35] there how he prayed to the
[7:38] Lord
[7:40] amen so we like we were saying now our
[7:43] thought for today is utterly slay and
[7:46] destroy the Enemy by Your Word seed
[7:52] amen if you have responded to the
[7:54] message of the
[7:55] hour and you believe the message of the
[7:58] hour
[7:59] something within you quickened you to
[8:02] the message of the hour yes yes to see
[8:05] Gene of God Amen so just remember that
[8:08] so David is going to utterly slay and
[8:11] Destroy because he has a word from the
[8:13] Lord to pursue the
[8:15] enemy amen hallelujah the Bride of this
[8:18] day and this hour has been given an
[8:20] order from the Lord to pursue the enemy
[8:23] to utterly slay and Destroy when they
[8:25] are given a prophecy in Revelation 10:11
[8:28] they are given a prophecy to prophesy
[8:30] again prophecy is to destroy the enemy
[8:32] that say the Lord is an atomic bomb on
[8:34] the enemy the prophet of God says that
[8:37] you want to know what Atomic Warfare is
[8:39] he said it's that sayth the
[8:41] Lord amen praise the Lord amen so we
[8:44] find here David is encouraging himself
[8:47] he goes to the Lord in prayer and he's
[8:49] asking the Lord to send the angel of the
[8:50] Lord before him to slay those enemies
[8:53] amen now we may be thinking that how can
[8:55] Angels kill men but if we show you some
[8:58] examples in the the Bible the angel of
[9:00] the Lord is a destroying Angel he can
[9:03] utterly slay and Destroy yes amen amen
[9:06] so there's a strategic alliance between
[9:08] the seen world and the Unseen World amen
[9:12] like when they surrounded that City that
[9:14] day you know we read Kings chapter 6
[9:16] there and they came in the night time
[9:19] and the saw physical ERS and chariots
[9:22] but there were ERS and chariots that
[9:24] could not be seen by the natural eye
[9:26] we've been through this last week Sunday
[9:27] the Unseen World amen so Satan copied
[9:31] the Unseen World he brought chariots he
[9:34] got these men to design the Chariots
[9:36] based after the Unseen World so Elisha
[9:38] says open the boy's eyes to the Unseen
[9:40] World amen amen hallelujah and I want
[9:43] you to know those ERS are still alive
[9:45] today oh yes those angels have not aged
[9:49] neither have those horses aged those are
[9:51] Supernatural horses amen amen they have
[9:54] Immortal Life hallelujah praise the Lord
[9:58] so we're finding here that that he goes
[10:00] and he he's got 600 men but then he
[10:02] leaves 200 men and he takes only 400 we
[10:06] know four is the number of Deliverance
[10:08] so God Amen in his perfect type he's
[10:10] going to deliver
[10:12] them so they go and they pursue and
[10:15] we'll just pick up some highlights I
[10:16] just want to get through this very
[10:18] quickly amen hallelujah so that we can
[10:20] get to the Crux of what we're trying to
[10:21] say this morning Hallelujah 1 Samuel
[10:25] chapter
[10:26] 30 just want to read some more
[10:28] scriptures is
[10:30] there but David pursued he and the 400
[10:33] men right and 200 behind so then
[10:36] they meet in Egyptian in the field we're
[10:38] not going to get to that the Egyptian
[10:39] tells them how they overtook the city
[10:42] and he says and when he had brought him
[10:44] down this is verse 16
[10:46] now so now the the Egyptian leads them
[10:49] to where these men who slay burned the
[10:52] city and took the people captive he
[10:55] brought them now to where they
[10:57] were and when he had brought him down
[11:00] behold they were spread abroad upon all
[11:01] the Earth eating drinking dancing this
[11:04] was like a
[11:06] nightclub they were rejoicing because
[11:08] all of the great spoils that had been
[11:10] taken out of the land of the Philistines
[11:12] out of the land of
[11:13] Judah but watch David now under the
[11:16] anointing under the leadership of seen
[11:18] and Unseen World David smoke them from
[11:21] the Twilight even un the evening of the
[11:23] next day amen amen when you are pursuing
[11:27] the enemy don't stop amen if you get a
[11:30] little relief of symptoms don't stop
[11:32] amen hallelujah if you pursuing the
[11:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost if you
[11:36] pursuing the new birth if you're
[11:38] pursuing for Greater Heights in the
[11:39] spirit of God don't stop oh thank you
[11:42] Lord totally slay and annihilate every
[11:44] unbelief from our life
[11:47] amen and they escaped ning man of them
[11:49] see 400 young men which rode upon camels
[11:51] and fled and David recovered all amen
[11:56] that the amalekites are carried away
[11:58] amen and David rescued his two
[12:00] wives and there was nothing lacking to
[12:03] them neither small nor great neither
[12:06] Sons nor daughters neither spoil nor
[12:09] anything that they had taken to them
[12:13] David recovered all amen we're not going
[12:17] to allow the enemy to take back anything
[12:19] from us whether it's our health whether
[12:21] it's our joy amen whether it's our
[12:23] children we do not allow him to take am
[12:27] God gave you your children
[12:29] to Holy wedlock you claim them amen you
[12:32] keep claiming them you have a concern if
[12:35] a mother amen there a m had a concern
[12:38] for a son who was dying he she and the
[12:40] Lord grounded an airplane because she
[12:43] was praying for a son God will not
[12:45] forsake your prayer oh yes God Amen
[12:47] prayer will make you stronger God will
[12:49] hear your prayer Hallelujah people say
[12:52] oh well you know we leave these things
[12:54] no as long as you have breath in your
[12:56] lung and the Rapture is not taking place
[12:59] claim every one of your loved ones amen
[13:01] hallelujah thank you Lord praise the
[13:03] Lord amen David recovered all and David
[13:07] took all the flocks and the hers which
[13:09] they drove before the those other cattle
[13:12] and said this is David's spoil now when
[13:14] they come back they come back to the 200
[13:16] men and these men remember not been in
[13:19] battle with them but yet they were part
[13:21] of the
[13:22] Army and the men started to get Carnel
[13:25] some of the 400 and said we will not
[13:27] return to them their spoil just give
[13:29] them their children and their wives but
[13:32] don't return to them everything that was
[13:35] stolen but David being a just King saids
[13:38] no amen they are off us amen our
[13:42] victories are their victories amen even

[14:09] reestablishing everything that the enemy

[25:23] when your true metal is
[25:26] tested amen praise the Lord

[25:30] must have the faith of Abraham and call
[25:33] those things which are not as though
[25:34] they are we're not asking you to live in
[25:37] denial maybe they diagnosed it correctly

[26:34] amen praise the Lord
[26:40] amen
[26:42] amen amen actually slay and Destroy we
[26:46] can't be sympathetic with the devil now
[26:48] amen amen amen amen praise the
[26:52] Lord let's get back to our sermon amen
[26:54] praise the Lord Acts 1:8 very important
[26:58] the
[26:59] Disciples of the Lord 120 of them are
[27:01] staying in the upper room it's a time of
[27:07] Silence the Lord told them T here in the
[27:10] city of Jerusalem until you endured with
[27:13] power that's the power we want this
[27:16] morning
[27:20] amen yes Lord Acts chapter
[27:22] 1:8 but you shall receive power amen
[27:28] when after the Holy Ghost is come upon
[27:31] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[27:35] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[27:38] in Samaria and unto the uttermost part
[27:41] of the earth after the Holy Ghost he's
[27:44] come upon
[27:45] you what is that the Lord is telling
[27:49] them you are in here now in Jerusalem
[27:53] amen I'm sing you to be
[27:56] Witnesses but I want you to prepare for
[27:58] an enlargement amen of territory yes
[28:03] you're going to go to
[28:05] Jerusalem Judea Samaria and South Africa
[28:12] amen the utmost parts of the earth
[28:19] sir so when God is going to give you
[28:21] enlargement he's going to equip you with
[28:24] power amen hallelujah then we know know
[28:28] on the day of Pentecost what happened
[28:30] how the Holy Ghost fell amen praise the
[28:38] Lord amen let's turn to one sorry John
[28:41] chapter John
[28:43] chapter one praise the
[28:49] Lord let see one more thing about the
[28:52] power here let me continue
[29:02] now we
[29:04] know that the promise of
[29:07] power is to them that can receive him
[29:12] who is him the prophet says who is him
[29:14] for every age the
[29:16] word the word released to every
[29:22] age amen so Acts chapter one said you
[29:26] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[29:28] has come upon you meaning the Holy Ghost
[29:30] has come for two things to birth you
[29:33] with a born again
[29:35] experience and to form you into the word
[29:38] image you can't be formed into the word
[29:40] image without being born
[29:42] again that's why I think many people are
[29:44] making the mistake they want to be
[29:46] formed into the word image but they have
[29:48] not been born again they have not had
[29:51] the right birth not at the right
[29:53] experience they haven't died to the
[29:55] things of the world they haven't died to
[29:57] the whole nature but they want to be
[29:58] formed into the word image it won't
[30:04] work so you have two experiences in one
[30:07] act when the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[30:10] now it's for your birth and for your
[30:12] adoption because we are going back to
[30:14] original sons that we were born to
[30:18] be praise the
[30:20] Lord so we were reading there John
[30:22] chapter
[30:23] 1 but as many as received him to them
[30:28] gave you what somebody say it loud to
[30:31] them gave he to become sons of God Amen
[30:37] even to them that believe on his name
[30:40] which were born not of blood not of the
[30:42] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[30:45] but of God so yeah it again he gave
[30:49] power to become sons of God a power has
[30:51] been released to the church he says n
[30:55] natural force put Israel in a Homeland
[30:57] he will take the power of God to put the
[30:59] church in the
[31:03] bride amen
[31:08] hallelujah so we find again what we are
[31:10] saying the promise of power is to them
[31:12] who receive him for the age him is the
[31:14] word for the age amen so yeah we know
[31:18] that in the beginning animals were
[31:19] supposed to be born by a by a sexual
[31:22] reproduction but sons of deity sons of
[31:25] God where to be born by the word and by
[31:27] the
[31:30] spirit amen and the word and the spirit
[31:33] make the spoken word you can't have
[31:35] mechanics without the Dynamics to have
[31:38] spoken word you've got to have the word
[31:40] and the
[31:41] spirit we are supposed to be born by the
[31:44] word and the spirit except a man be born
[31:46] of water and the spirit so Jesus Christ
[31:49] brought back the original way as to how
[31:52] sons of God should be born
[31:58] I want to I want to prove this to you in
[32:01] Genesis chapter 1 amen let's just read
[32:03] you quickly Genesis chapter
[32:08] one in the beginning God created the
[32:10] heavens and the Earth and the Earth was
[32:12] without form and void and
[32:15] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[32:17] and watch the spirit of God moved over
[32:21] the face of the
[32:23] waters but that's only the moving of the
[32:25] spirit what does it need come on now we
[32:28] just said spirit and word what does he
[32:31] need so the spirit of God moving over
[32:34] the face of the waters couldn't do
[32:36] anything except it was expressed through
[32:38] the logos through the word so it's only
[32:42] when when God speaks the word can now
[32:44] the spirit and word come into action am
[32:47] everybody see that the spirit of God
[32:49] Alone was moving over the face of the
[32:51] waters and then God releases a word and
[32:55] God said let there be light and there
[32:58] light yes amen so the fullness is spirit
[33:02] and word mechanics and Dynamics so Jesus
[33:05] Christ brought back the original way
[33:08] that sons of God should be born we are
[33:10] not born again by coming to church we
[33:12] are not born again by shaking hands we
[33:14] are not born again by putting our name
[33:16] on the church register we are not born
[33:18] again by some emotions but we are born
[33:20] by word and by spirit amen that's been
[33:23] released in this age not a word released
[33:26] in Luther's age neither in Wesley's age
[33:28] but a word released in this age so that
[33:31] was God's original intention how we
[33:34] should be born so the spoken word is
[33:36] word and spirit together and we know the
[33:39] spoken word cannot fail yes amen because
[33:42] word and spirit cannot fail and that's
[33:45] the power to the church word and spirit
[33:47] together I'm trying to show you the
[33:49] power that you are to receive amen you
[33:52] shall receive power tering the city of
[33:54] Jerusalem receive power as many as
[33:56] received power to then he gave power to
[33:58] become sons of God so the power is word
[34:01] and spirit amen and that tell me in
[34:03] which other age has word and spirit been
[34:05] released
[34:07] amen didn't Jesus say in that day they
[34:10] shall worship me in spirit and in truth
[34:13] truth is the word didn't pilot I think
[34:15] asked Jesus what is
[34:18] truth my word is
[34:20] truth spirit and
[34:24] word amen so how do you receive him he
[34:27] said says for as many as received him so
[34:29] how do we receive him the only way that
[34:31] we can ever be born again is to receive
[34:34] the word in the wh of your
[34:37] mind
[34:40] Hallelujah that's how we are born again
[34:42] you must be able to receive the word in
[34:45] the wh of your mind because in your
[34:47] heart is the word seed
[34:50] representation the prop of God says when
[34:53] when when when the battle was
[34:55] set God shows the heart
[34:58] Satan shows the
[35:00] mind so how God works he sends the word
[35:03] he sends the mind but it must drop down
[35:06] to the heart because in the heart is the
[35:08] word Gene
[35:10] seed that's your
[35:14] representation that's the Eternal Zoe
[35:16] life within you but it needs a word to
[35:19] Quicken
[35:20] it so Satan shows the Battleground to
[35:23] infiltrate the word from dropping from
[35:25] the mind to the heart
[35:29] you see why he gives you mind battles
[35:32] you see why he tells you it's not
[35:33] possible yes right so we are not to have
[35:38] mental defeats in our mind but we ought
[35:40] to be having mind victories if you if
[35:42] you keep the word in your mind you will
[35:44] be an overcomer
[35:47] am where's the
[35:49] Battleground the mind so you've got to
[35:52] take the word to the mind to the
[35:55] Battleground and slay the enemy every
[35:58] thought bring it under obedience to the
[36:00] word of
[36:01] God take every thought captive how you
[36:04] going to catch it captive by the
[36:08] word not by psychology the only way you
[36:11] can Captivate those thoughts is by the
[36:14] word and the devil's job is to take away
[36:17] the word from your heart from your
[36:20] mind but the holy spirit is here as that
[36:23] angel of God to give you Grace to keep
[36:25] the word of God in this hour
[36:28] so God Jesus gave us the the key he says
[36:31] it is written it is written God said so
[36:36] amen hallelujah some of you need to keep
[36:39] your mouth closed about speaking because
[36:42] you only speak negative
[36:44] things if you don't know what to say say
[36:47] Satan it is written yes God said so I
[36:50] believe it it must be according to the
[36:53] word amen God said so if God speaks the
[36:56] word the enemy fights the word amen
[36:59] through Avenues of Your Mind through
[37:01] Avenues of memory reasoning
[37:05] affection your
[37:07] conscience how do you feel Satan wants
[37:09] you to keep you focus on your feeling
[37:12] it's not how I feel it's what the word
[37:14] of God says about me I'm more than a
[37:16] conqueror greater is he that's in me
[37:19] than he that's in the world why you want
[37:22] me to confess how I feel
[37:27] if you really want to
[37:29] know I feel
[37:31] like giving you devil but we know we
[37:35] can't attack him in the physical so we
[37:37] attack him spiritual if you want Satan
[37:40] to be defeated this is how you defeat
[37:42] him amen our greatest weapon our
[37:46] greatest Authority right so you've got
[37:48] to be able to keep the word in your mind
[37:50] right in the face of your emotions right
[37:52] in the face of your feelings no matter
[37:55] how Satan comes to whisper in your ears
[37:57] no matter how down you feel you don't
[37:59] bow down to your feelings your feelings
[38:01] must bow down to the word of God no
[38:04] matter how sick you are you don't B on
[38:06] to that sickness your sickness must B on
[38:08] to the word of God can I get some
[38:10] Christians here who will utterly slay
[38:12] and
[38:14] Destroy trouble come on any hand you
[38:17] utterly Sway and destroy you take the
[38:19] word of God to your work you take the
[38:21] word of God to your school you take the
[38:22] word of God to your home you take the
[38:24] word of God everywhere that you go josua
[38:28] every place the soul of your foot shall
[38:30] tread you shall possess yes Lord amen oh
[38:36] thank you Jesus thank you amen you've
[38:39] got to confess it you've got to say it
[38:42] people want to think the word no say the
[38:44] word speak the word Romans amen 10 says
[38:48] if you believe in your heart and confess
[38:50] with your mouth you've got to be able to
[38:52] speak the word
[38:55] amen if God had kept up all all his
[38:57] thoughts in the back part of his mind in
[38:59] the beginning if nothing would have
[39:01] manifested it had to move from a thought
[39:03] to a word spoken don't just think oh no
[39:06] I believe the message I me if you can
[39:08] read my mind beside my wife I me if you
[39:10] can read my
[39:12] mind what I'm thinking now you see you
[39:14] can't think
[39:16] that but when a word is
[39:19] spoken it releases something into the
[39:22] atmosphere and it goes about to be a
[39:24] creative power of God
[39:34] Hallelujah Romans uh chter 12 amen
[39:40] hallelujah I beseech you therefore
[39:42] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[39:44] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[39:47] holy acceptable to God which is your
[39:50] reasonable service and be not conformed
[39:53] to this
[39:54] world amen amen
[39:58] but be transformed be transfigured be
[40:01] changed what by the renewing of your
[40:04] mind so you're being changed transformed
[40:07] transfigured from a sinner to a saint
[40:09] being transformed from a regular son to
[40:12] a Son of God there's a transformational
[40:14] work being done within each and every
[40:16] one of us and the power of the word is a
[40:19] power of transformation Hallelujah so
[40:22] how can you be transformed by the
[40:23] renewing of your mind the only way for
[40:26] transformation to take place your mind
[40:29] must first be renewed what is the Bible
[40:31] saying be renewed in your mind yes
[40:34] that's right amen start to think like a
[40:36] Son of God start to act like a Son of
[40:39] God amen amen you must have seen that
[40:41] picture a young boy with tattered
[40:43] clothes nothing to you can see he's poor
[40:46] he's a beggar but he's looking in the
[40:48] mirror and the image in the mirror is
[40:50] one with a suit one well dressed one
[40:53] with his haircut what he sees how he
[40:56] sees himself in the mdle
[40:58] how do you see yourself do you see
[41:00] yourself as a son and daughter of God do
[41:02] you see yourself as part of God's
[41:03] economy amen hallelujah that you are
[41:06] amen part of God's economy you are his
[41:08] greatest treasure that your soul is
[41:10] worth 10,000 words amen amen that you
[41:13] are the reason he is coming back in this
[41:15] hour amen amen I want you to know God
[41:18] kept you back in this age not for no
[41:20] reason yes sir God kept you back in this
[41:23] age because you are the ones that can
[41:25] overcome this age
[41:28] hallelujah thank you Lord he couldn't
[41:31] have any other one here to overcome this
[41:33] age but you were the ones with the gene
[41:36] seed of God which means you have genetic
[41:39] qualities of God within you your DNA and
[41:43] if you know what DNA means your DNA
[41:46] carries the DNA of
[41:48] God come on now who knows what DNA means
[41:52] anyone scientists oh you're all looking
[41:54] down now nobody knows what DNA means
[41:58] blood hey blood yes it's to do with the
[42:01] bloodline but I'm talking about the
[42:03] acronym what does DNA
[42:07] mean very good that's what science is
[42:12] but DNA means means divine nature
[42:18] attributes you're right brother
[42:21] Kenzo that's the scientific term you're
[42:23] very intelligent I didn't even know that
[42:28] [Music]
[42:30] divine nature attributes amen I carry
[42:34] the DNA of God within
[42:37] me didn't Peter say you you shall have
[42:39] the divine nature of God Amen he's
[42:42] talking about your
[42:44] DNA amen divine nature
[42:48] attributes you got to be transformed by
[42:50] your mind amen that you may prove that
[42:53] which is good what is acceptable and the
[42:55] perfect will of God so the mind is the
[42:57] battlefield is like the middle man and
[42:59] your soul is your wor seed and you have
[43:02] to thank God that you have a wor seed
[43:04] within you
[43:06] amen amen and we understand by the
[43:08] message of the hour that your word seed
[43:11] was expressed by the
[43:13] logos Hallelujah let me say that again
[43:17] Lord I don't want you to get over your
[43:19] head H at
[43:22] thoughts amen and he had to find a form
[43:25] of expression
[43:28] like Satan can only walk through doubt
[43:29] and reasoning unbelief God can only walk
[43:33] through his word God will work through
[43:35] no other way except through his
[43:37] word God will only work so you can only
[43:40] work through the
[43:42] logos that's how he finds expression
[43:44] through the
[43:46] logos so he

[47:05] I hope we got some good Catholics in the
[47:07] message
[47:08] church because they don't know how these
[47:10] things work the prophet says the reason
[47:13] why John Bryan could maintain his
[47:15] confession he was a Catholic and you
[47:17] tell a Catholic say five mares he will
[47:19] do it
[47:21] diligently but yeah message people they
[47:23] think ah one time I must
[47:25] speak you know Jesus prayed for somebody

[48:04] confession people here don't believe
[48:07] message of the hour they say believe a
[48:08] prophet they don't know how to operate
[48:10] by spiritual laws the power of your
[48:13] confession maintaining your confession
[48:16] until one day John Ryan said it for the
[48:18] last time one of these days if you are
[48:20] maintaining your confession you are
[48:22] going to say it for the last time amen

[51:03] truth because Satan comes through the
[51:05] Mind amen he will come against it remind

[51:33] as the seeds was coming out some were
[51:35] finding
[51:36] defects Hallelujah he produced an Isaac
[51:40] but that was the natural son Hallelujah
[51:43] If Abraham had possessed the power of
[51:45] the spoken word he would have spoke
[51:47] Jesus into existence the Royal Seed of
[51:49] Abraham but he was reproducing the
[51:52] animal way and he brought forth Isaac
[51:55] and Isaac brought forth
[51:58] Jacob and out of Jacob came forth 12
[52:04] genetics but Jacob was moving in Grace
[52:08] the prophet of God says Abraham was
[52:11] election Isaac was
[52:15] justification Jacob was Grace and he
[52:18] says Joseph was Perfection there's a
[52:21] seed line within you the gene of God

[52:41] so and it will be
[52:42] so amen hallelujah people are finding it
[52:45] hard to be born again amen because what
[52:48] they will take in their mind amen what
[52:50] what are they taking from the world or

[56:06] Isaiah
[56:07] 29:8 This Is How They are this is how
[56:10] God will confuse them it will be as when
[56:12] a Hungry Man dreams that he is eating
[56:15] but when he awakens his hunger is not
[56:17] satisfied or when a man is thirsty
[56:20] dreams that he is drinking but when he
[56:22] awakens in fact he is faint and his

[56:45] Zion is the bride
[56:48] amen I want to show you how the Angelic
[56:51] gets involved When you pray amen very
[56:54] quickly let's turn to 2 Chronicles CH
[56:56] 32:
[56:57] 211 people think amen that we we don't
[57:00] have an Unseen World yet to assist the
[57:02] Sons and Daughters of God I want you to
[57:04] see who was fighting these
[57:06] battles
[57:09] amen who the Lord sends it says and the
[57:12] Lord sent an angel which cut off all the
[57:16] Mighty Men of Valor and the leaders and
[57:19] captains in the camp of assy of the king
[57:21] of
[57:22] Assyria who did it
[57:26] the angel of the
[57:27] Lord cut off all the Mighty Men of Val
[57:30] and the leaders and captains in the camp
[57:33] of the king so he returned with shame
[57:35] face in his own land and when he came
[57:37] into the house of his God that they C
[57:41] that they that came forth of his own bow
[57:44] slew him see son slew him there with the
[57:47] sword 2 Kings
[57:50] 19:35 and that very night the angel of
[57:53] the Lord went out and struck 158,000 man
[57:56] in the
[57:57] camp

[58:13] coming against the children of
[58:15] God and God will rise up he says

[58:28] now you know why in Exodus 23 it
[58:31] says beware of
[58:35] him Daniel 3:28 then Nebuchadnezzar
[58:38] spake and he said blessed be the Lord
[58:40] God of Shadrach Meshach and Abino who
[58:42] has sent his
[58:44] what his Angel and delivered his
[58:47] servants that trusted in him and have
[58:49] changed the king's word and healed their
[58:51] bodies that they may not serve nor
[58:53] worship any God except their own God
[58:55] acts chap 12: 23 I'm going very quickly
[58:58] to this immediately this is talking
[59:00] about aod because aod did not give glory
[59:02] to God an angel of the Lord struck him
[59:07] down and he was eaten by worms and
[59:10] died amen 1 Corinthians
[59:14] 10:10 and do not
[59:16] complain and do not complain as some of
[59:19] them did and were killed by the
[59:21] destroying
[59:23] Angel right Exodus 12:23 for the Lord
[59:26] will pass through the and smite the
[59:28] Egyptians when they see the blood upon
[59:30] the lentil and upon the two side poost

[59:42] show you Revelation 10 it's a time of
[59:47] War it's a military setting it's a time
[59:50] of war the mighty angel coming down why
[59:53] does he Roar
[59:57] brother Bram says when a lion roar it
[59:58] strikes fear Into the Heart of the
[1:00:01] enemy so he
[1:00:03] Roars and his feet pillars of fire he
[1:00:07] steps upon those two beasts to suppress
[1:00:10] their powers amen praise the Lord let's
[1:00:13] just go through two more examples Joshua
[1:00:15] 10:11 and it came to pass as they fled
[1:00:18] from Israel and we're going down
[1:00:22] to bethon that the Lord cast down great
[1:00:29] Stones the Lord cast down great stones
[1:00:32] from Heaven upon them unto ezeka and

[1:01:13] prophet says Satan hates Revelation he
[1:01:16] doesn't want you to get a revelation of
[1:01:17] who you are because Satan becomes
[1:01:19] powerless before you before you amen so
[1:01:23] we are Standing on the Promises of God
[1:01:25] no Fallen Spirit can tell us something
[1:01:27] different how are we going to defeat the
[1:01:29] enemy by the word it is written God said

[1:01:46] lost hallelujah amen thank you Lord my
[1:01:51] salvation my Redemption was paid before
[1:01:54] the foundation of the world I I am a
[1:01:56] sealed product of
[1:01:58] Elohim praise the Lord hallelujah praise
[1:02:01] the Lord are you a sealed product yes

[1:02:17] framed if you leak now you're going to
[1:02:19] leak on me you must be a sealed
[1:02:23] product let's go to that quote amen 15
[1:02:26] what is the Holy Ghost that's what the
[1:02:28] matter we don't get sealed so much we
[1:02:30] too loose about things when the
[1:02:33] inspector comes through to inspect your
[1:02:34] life to see if you're not just loose
[1:02:37] about things little loose about your
[1:02:39] prayer
[1:02:40] life little loose about that temper
[1:02:43] little loose about that tongue to talk
[1:02:45] about others he'll never seal the
[1:02:51] car some dirty abotts some V things some
[1:02:55] vulgarity mind he can't seal the car but
[1:02:58] when he's found everything is in place
[1:03:00] the inspector then he seals it who's
[1:03:01] this
[1:03:02] inspector the tutor the
[1:03:05] guide now watch what he says dare
[1:03:09] anybody touch that
[1:03:13] seal so if you're
[1:03:16] sealed dare anybody touch you dare
[1:03:20] anybody open that seal until that car
[1:03:22] has reached its destination to where it
[1:03:25] seal before that's it touch not my
[1:03:28] anointed do my prophets no harm for I
[1:03:30] say unto you it is better that a
[1:03:32] millstone was hanged around your neck
[1:03:34] and you were drowned in the depths of
[1:03:35] the
[1:03:37] sea then for you to offend or shake a
[1:03:40] little on these last least of these
[1:03:42] that's been sealed you see what it means
[1:03:44] that's what the holy spirit is it's your
[1:03:46] Assurance it's your protection it's your
[1:03:49] witness amen amen it's your seal it's
[1:03:53] your sign I'm Heaven bound don't care
[1:03:54] what the devil says I'm Heaven
[1:03:57] bound he sealed me he gave it to me he
[1:04:00] sealed me to his kingdom I'm Glory bound
[1:04:02] let the winds blow let Satan do what he
[1:04:04] wants God has sealed me till the day of
[1:04:06] my Redemption that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:04:09] is oh you should want it I can't go on
[1:04:12] without it so much could be said there
[1:04:14] but I'm sure you know what I'm speaking
[1:04:16] of so believe in your heart and keep
[1:04:19] confessing it that I shall be filled and
[1:04:22] I shall be refilled amen thank you Lord
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:27] hallelujah I want you to know those that
[1:04:29] were carrying oil in the lamb started to
[1:04:31] lose
[1:04:32] oil finally they ran out of oil the five
[1:04:36] foolish
[1:04:38] amen so you must be able to receive the
[1:04:41] word like we were saying in your home
[1:04:44] and many of us face that challenge we
[1:04:46] can't just take the word when we are
[1:04:48] facing
[1:04:49] challenges in fact for some of us the
[1:04:52] word is the last resort when we are
[1:04:54] facing challenges
[1:04:58] but the Bible says let the weak say I
[1:05:01] am amen let the poor say I
[1:05:05] am let those without the Holy Ghost say
