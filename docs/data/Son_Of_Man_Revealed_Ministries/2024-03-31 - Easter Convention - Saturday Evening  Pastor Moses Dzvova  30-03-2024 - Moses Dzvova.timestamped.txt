[46:29] atmosphere so without wasting much time
[46:33] let's go straight to the
[46:36] word Matthew chapter
[46:39] 17 Matthew chapter
[46:48] 17 we read from verse
[46:52] 10 the Bible says and his disciples
[46:57] asked him saying why then say the
[47:03] scribes that Elias must first come amen
[47:08] so they knew that Elias was supposed to
[47:12] come and we all know that Elijah God
[47:16] loved the spirit of Elijah that it had
[47:19] to come five times are we together it
[47:23] came on the original Elijah and it came
[47:27] on Elisha with a double portion I
[47:31] believe that you and me we are the
[47:33] Elisha with the double portion I
[47:37] remember Elijah said Elijah said what
[47:40] must I do before I am taken away from
[47:45] you and Elisha said I want a double
[47:49] portion and Elijah said you have asked
[47:53] for a
[47:54] heart but nevertheless
[47:57] if you see me going you are going to
[48:00] receive that double
[48:03] portion so I also want to say if you see
[48:08] me preaching until I head over the
[48:12] service to the pastor then you receive
[48:14] your desires if you sleep I'm not
[48:17] responsible if you see me
[48:21] amen
[48:23] hallelujah praise God are you happy
[48:27] [Music]
[48:28] are you under
[48:30] expectation amen let's continue and his
[48:34] disciples ask him saying why they say
[48:38] the scribes that Elias must first
[48:42] come and Jesus answered and said unto
[48:45] them
[48:48] Elias truly shall face come and restore
[48:52] all
[48:53] things so what must Elijah do
[48:57] Elijah must come and restore all
[49:01] things
[49:03] hallelujah
[49:05] amen Elias must first come and restore
[49:09] all
[49:11] things but I say unto you that Elias is
[49:16] come
[49:17] already and they have and they knew him
[49:21] not but have done unto him whatsoever
[49:26] they listen
[49:28] likewise shall also the son of men
[49:31] suffer of them we may be seated may God
[49:35] bless you
[49:38] amen
[49:40] hallelujah
[49:43] amen so I'm not saying they should
[49:47] increase the volume but I think it's a
[49:50] draging me a little bit maybe it can be
[49:54] tuned a little bit amen so how many are
[49:57] been
[49:58] blessed how many are under
[50:02] expectation amen praise be to God yeah
[50:06] it's more like yeah so how many a b
[50:10] bless so I just want to read
[50:14] a a quotation where I'm going to take my
[50:18] my text hallelujah amen so we just want
[50:22] to just give a small title just want to
[50:26] give a small title amen we are talking
[50:29] about the long awaited restoration and
[50:33] the final quickening for long awaited
[50:38] restoration are we together I will
[50:41] restore says the Lord do you love him so
[50:46] we are talking about his long awaited
[50:51] restoration are you there for
[50:54] restoration huh some of you
[50:57] you know restoration you can touch it in
[51:01] different aspects
[51:03] hallelujah amen so in the message a
[51:07] resume of the
[51:09] ages brother Bram
[51:12] says this age started just after the 10
[51:17] of the 20th
[51:19] century as it was to be the age in which
[51:24] the true church would return to be the
[51:28] [Music]
[51:30] bride she the bride she was at Pentecost
[51:36] can I repeat it again this age as it was
[51:40] to be the age in which the true church
[51:45] would return to being the
[51:49] bride we must be the
[51:51] bride there is a difference between the
[51:54] bride and the church
[51:57] Noah was the type of the church he went
[52:01] through the
[52:02] tribulation but Enoch was the type of
[52:05] the grind he was
[52:08] rapted are we
[52:11] together so when I think about you know
[52:15] when you bought an aeroplane there is a
[52:18] business class and the economy are we
[52:22] together but you both reach the Destin
[52:27] are we together but those who are in the
[52:31] economy they will be in the
[52:33] tribulation they have to go through
[52:36] rigorous processes checkins and this and
[52:39] that but those who are in the business
[52:42] class they are treated special are we
[52:46] together they don't go through hassles
[52:50] are we together just like our
[52:52] Pentecostal friends some of them will be
[52:55] there they will make it but they will
[52:58] make it VI the
[53:00] tribulation but you and me are we
[53:07] together the
[53:10] same are economy others are on the
[53:14] business class so Noah was in the
[53:17] business class you know was in the
[53:20] business class huh are we together and
[53:25] Noah was in the economy he went through
[53:28] the what the
[53:30] tribulation the bride will not go
[53:34] through the
[53:35] tribulation are we together there is no
[53:38] man that wants to make his wife to serer
[53:42] so you are Mrs Jesus are we
[53:46] [Music]
[53:47] together can I say this before I
[53:50] continue you know my brothers sisters
[53:52] you understand this I don't care whether
[53:56] you have a stit
[53:58] husband but when the time where you are
[54:01] pregnant that's where you take
[54:04] advantage HH you just say you see my tmy
[54:08] I need ice cream my pregnan needs
[54:12] McDonald the husband will buy even if
[54:15] you say I need some mango your husband
[54:18] will climb the tree to hear what I'm
[54:20] saying because you are
[54:24] pregnant with his
[54:27] seed so during these meetings you must
[54:30] you miss Jesus the prophet says that the
[54:35] bride will never be
[54:38] impregnated she's already
[54:40] pregnant with the world I am
[54:45] pregnant and Jesus Christ is responsible
[54:49] how many can say I said my pregnancy
[54:55] want my husband the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:59] will
[55:00] die are you
[55:02] [Applause]
[55:04] [Music]
[55:06] pregnant so that's what I'm
[55:09] saying I need the
[55:12] token say I need the power my husband
[55:18] the Lord Jesus Christ sisters take
[55:24] advantage how many can say am
[55:28] are you
[55:29] happy do you love
[55:32] him amen the bride won't go through the
[55:37] tribulation are you
[55:39] happy like I said I just want to see how
[55:43] I arrange my things but like I said a
[55:46] corruption won't set in hallelujah amen
[55:50] God bless you Pastor n hallelujah how
[55:53] many love our
[55:55] elders God bless you all the God's
[55:58] generals I appreciate you Hallelujah I
[56:02] am not worthy are we together but it is
[56:05] just falling my Lord amen so now let's H
[56:10] read quickly hallelujah amen we are
[56:14] talking about the
[56:16] restoration the long awaited restoration
[56:20] listen this age started just after the
[56:24] 10 of the 20th century
[56:26] as it was to be in the age in which the
[56:30] true church would return to be the bride
[56:35] she was at
[56:37] Pentecost we know that huh they must of
[56:43] necessity be a return of dynamic
[56:48] [Music]
[56:49] power the master of
[56:53] necessity be a return of dynamic power
[56:59] how many say these me they must of what
[57:04] of necessity being a r of dynamic
[57:09] power
[57:11] hallelujah oh how are going to keep the
[57:13] fire ping how many are going to keep the
[57:16] fire ping tell your neor and say come on
[57:19] say
[57:20] amen hallelujah let's create an
[57:24] atmosphere because it is the anointing
[57:28] that breaks the
[57:30] Yoke everything needs an
[57:33] atmosphere do you love
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:39] him we
[57:42] know we know that they must of necessity
[57:47] be a rain of damic power then the
[57:52] prophet says the
[57:54] Believers s this in their spirit and
[57:59] began crying to God for a new
[58:05] outpouring such as was in the first
[58:09] century listen now what seemed to be the
[58:14] answer came as many began to speak in
[58:19] tongues and manifest gift of the spirit
[58:25] listen now so people they were sensing a
[58:29] return of dynamic
[58:32] power so as they sensed the return of
[58:36] dynamic power some Believers started
[58:40] prophesying started speaking in Tong are
[58:44] we together the gifts of the Spirit they
[58:47] were now in operation but watch now are
[58:51] you there God bless you listen it it was
[58:56] then believed now it's good can amen it
[59:01] was then believed that this was indeed H
[59:06] the long awaited
[59:09] restoration so this is a tou one now I
[59:13] hope I have to say this humbly past name
[59:17] I'm not against the N spiritual gift I'm
[59:20] not against anything but I want you to
[59:22] hear what brother bam says people my
[59:26] brother God bless you as people were
[59:29] manifesting the gift speaking in Tong
[59:32] they thought that was the long awaited
[59:35] what restoration then the prophet says
[59:39] it was
[59:42] not so why we are here Pastor the
[59:47] manifestation brother es the
[59:49] manifestation of the N spiritual gift
[59:53] it's not the long awaited
[59:57] restoration is that
[59:59] right no I just want to hear an amen is
[1:00:03] that right it's not me are we together
[1:00:07] it's the prophet is it wrong to speak in
[1:00:10] Tong no are we
[1:00:13] together even in my church there is some
[1:00:16] sometimes sometimes when the Holy Ghost
[1:00:18] comes down sometimes a sister Rises up
[1:00:22] speaks in tongues say the lord it's
[1:00:26] Pastor MOS speaking it's me do you hear
[1:00:29] what I'm saying and we thank God for
[1:00:31] that are we together but it's not what
[1:00:35] the long awaited
[1:00:38] restoration after we speak in t we have
[1:00:41] to go
[1:00:42] higher we need a
[1:00:45] religion we need something that is more
[1:00:48] than the N Spirit of gift the prophet
[1:00:52] says T is the list of the N spiritual
[1:00:57] gift how many say Amen but you love
[1:01:01] him I remember the Prophecies of d h you
[1:01:06] have chosen the narrow a huge portion of
[1:01:09] Heaven be and even when I was listening
[1:01:13] to the TS some of the TS you would hear
[1:01:16] Tong being spoken how many can say Amen
[1:01:21] it's not a crime it's not a sin even to
[1:01:26] maybe after I finish preaching someone
[1:01:28] gets inspired and speak in Tong it's
[1:01:31] still
[1:01:33] correct but if you say that's the long
[1:01:37] awaited restoration that's when the era
[1:01:40] comes how many say how many are being
[1:01:45] blessed
[1:01:47] amen I know we are traing on thin eyes
[1:01:52] you know when we touch about these
[1:01:53] things we are trading on what on thin
[1:01:57] eyes Hallelujah but let's continue do
[1:02:00] you love
[1:02:01] him it was believed that this was indeed
[1:02:07] the long awaited
[1:02:10] restoration the prophet says it was not
[1:02:15] for the latter rain came can can come
[1:02:20] only after the former reain after the
[1:02:24] former reain which is the
[1:02:26] or teaching rain
[1:02:29] Hallelujah the latter rain huh the L
[1:02:34] rain then is the harest
[1:02:38] rain HH how could this this
[1:02:43] say how could this be the real thing
[1:02:48] which real thing the manifestation of
[1:02:51] the gift so brother says how could this
[1:02:55] be the real thing when the teaching R
[1:02:59] had not
[1:03:01] come the prophet messenger who was to be
[1:03:04] sent to teach the people and take the
[1:03:08] hearts of the children back to the pente
[1:03:11] fathers it's not yet
[1:03:15] comeall are you not going to Stone
[1:03:19] me are you not going to sto
[1:03:21] me is there corruption as yet are we
[1:03:26] message of the
[1:03:27] hour
[1:03:29] hallelujah amen God bless you CH you are
[1:03:33] a wonderful audience I don't feel some
[1:03:37] resentment Hallelujah you can take the
[1:03:40] word may God bless the pastors you know
[1:03:45] sometimes
[1:03:46] Pastor visiting ministers when they see
[1:03:49] people jumping shouting they feel they
[1:03:52] are more powerful but they don't know
[1:03:55] that it is the local pastors that laid
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:01] foundation I was hearing Pastor M said
[1:04:05] pastor Moses what you are preaching it's
[1:04:08] exactly what we preaching in our church
[1:04:11] even
[1:04:13] Pastor who is this Adrian he was say
[1:04:16] Pastor Moses if you had what we were
[1:04:19] preaching in our church you just came
[1:04:22] exactly Hallelujah do you understand my
[1:04:25] brother my
[1:04:27] so it makes us my job to be easier
[1:04:31] because we are in familiar hallah
[1:04:34] ground so let's clap hands for our
[1:04:41] pastors you are making my job to be
[1:04:45] easy hallelujah amen God bless you
[1:04:49] pastors Hallelujah God bless you I won't
[1:04:52] be fooled to think that I'm powerful how
[1:04:55] many can say Amen it is the pastors that
[1:04:59] have planted the
[1:05:01] seeds amen so let's continue he says the
[1:05:06] latter rain then is the harest rain how
[1:05:10] could this be the real thing huh let's
[1:05:14] jump listen are you happy he says the
[1:05:18] prophet messenger who was to be sent to
[1:05:21] teach the people and take the heart of
[1:05:24] the children to the pente fathers had
[1:05:28] not yet come that's L that's what was
[1:05:33] thought to be the
[1:05:36] restoration and the final quickening
[1:05:40] unto the rure it's not come so the final
[1:05:46] wecking how many can say amen and the
[1:05:49] restoration is not the ni spiritual gift
[1:05:53] though it is good
[1:05:57] as good as the gifts are I'm just
[1:05:59] reading I've not added anything I'm just
[1:06:03] reading Hallelujah can I repeat it again
[1:06:08] that's what was thought to be the
[1:06:11] restoration and the final quickening
[1:06:15] unto the Raptor it not
[1:06:19] come
[1:06:21] Hallelujah in it oh oh oh he says in it
[1:06:26] was a mixture of the unrighteous
[1:06:29] partaking of spiritual blessing and
[1:06:33] manifestation in the Holy Ghost as we
[1:06:37] have kept pointing out to you in it also
[1:06:43] was devil power as men were under the
[1:06:47] control of devils yet no one seemed to
[1:06:51] realize it then to prove that was not
[1:06:56] the
[1:06:57] real these people even before a second
[1:07:02] generation had appeared
[1:07:04] organized and wrot their unscriptural
[1:07:08] doctrines and built their own F season
[1:07:12] as every other group ahead of them
[1:07:16] did how many are being
[1:07:18] blessed that's why I'm saying the LA
[1:07:23] awaited the LA
[1:07:26] awaited
[1:07:27] restoration and the final
[1:07:31] quickening is it thanks your
[1:07:34] gift the long awaited restoration is it
[1:07:37] the is it the speaking in
[1:07:41] Tong can I hear
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:44] again so I can continue but is it
[1:07:48] wrong is it wrong for people to speak in
[1:07:52] Tong yes hallelujah it's there are we
[1:07:56] together it's a portion of the word of
[1:07:59] God are we
[1:08:01] together we
[1:08:03] can't say we don't want to hear someone
[1:08:06] speaking in Tong no when God wants to
[1:08:10] speak are we together God is Sovereign
[1:08:14] are we together what we can only do is
[1:08:17] to make sure it is done according to the
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:23] order you know they was a certain
[1:08:26] brother in a meeting like this it was a
[1:08:29] wonderful meeting a convention and then
[1:08:32] he just stood up in the last day of the
[1:08:35] meeting and he spoke in tongues he broke
[1:08:38] in tongues and there was no
[1:08:41] interpreter and the elders who knew the
[1:08:44] word that they must be an interpreter
[1:08:48] they said brother there's nothing wrong
[1:08:51] that you spok in Tong but why is it
[1:08:53] there was no interpreter and you know
[1:08:56] what the brother said the brother said I
[1:08:59] thought that such a good meeting like
[1:09:01] this could not end without
[1:09:06] time how many do you see now it's not
[1:09:09] for sure of it has to be
[1:09:13] God and if God can use somebody to speak
[1:09:18] in Tong you can feel it you can see this
[1:09:21] is God hallah how many can say Amen
[1:09:25] do you love
[1:09:27] him can
[1:09:29] iue he said no no no no these were
[1:09:32] wonderful meetings they should not end
[1:09:34] without a turn we don't play like go
[1:09:38] with God like that are we together this
[1:09:41] is serious
[1:09:43] business oh friends the long awaited

[1:39:28] giving examples that could relate John
[1:39:31] the Baptist was giving examples of
[1:39:34] snakes are we together and Grasshoppers
[1:39:37] and that's what he was seeing how many
[1:39:45] say he says M will be revealed in the
[1:39:51] last day when the seven Angel's message
[1:39:56] listen not when he starts out doing
[1:40:02] this
[1:40:04] part when he begins to sound his
[1:40:10] message not when he starts out doing
[1:40:13] what peace but when he begins to sound
[1:40:18] his
[1:40:19] message not the yes in PR
[1:40:25] but when he begins to sound the
[1:40:29] message these Mysteries then will be
[1:40:32] revealed and here they are not knowing
