========================================

damn psycho amen when was this picture taken on the 28th of February a what magazine packed it up Life Magazine amen you think all these things are coincidence and this was the seven seal amen go and type search seven seal on your search and see how many time it appears there 63 times is it coincidence in 1963 hey so all these things was happening but the seven angel had to be on the scene God could have revealed it in fourth time Paul was seeing all these Mysteries you are seeing all these great things but it wasn't lawful for him to speak at that time and everything Paul spoke was in mystery form but now it's coming things are going to be revealed plainly but is it for the whole world in the lives you say like Romeo come and take away Juliet amen since he's talking about his mysterious coming amen the cycle of his coming the process of his coming how he's gonna come and the process inuchi will come is a mystery secrets without a public show yes amen amen this thing is revealed to a special class of people a people that will come into an invisible Union amen before we go there let's read the scripture we read Exodus 23 20. I want you to understand the significance of all these things that you see how the Lord was leading out the spirit is leading he took us to all this process of all these teachings thank you but in Revelation 10 1 let's look at Luke The Book of Luke chapter 21 verse 27-28 27 says and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory 28 says and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draw it lie amen now these things took place let's see what Peter is saying you know in second Peter chapter three [Music] second Peter chapter 3 saying the second Apostle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that Jay may be mindful of the word which was spoken before by the only Prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostle of the law of the Lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days coffers working after their own and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they wake up the beginning of the creation for this day willingly are ignorant of their by the word of God the heavens way of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that was there that then was being overflowed water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and Petition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is what the Lord is in Thousand Years and a thousand years at one day amen amen now if you look at nine you say the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men conflictness in some some people got impatient and they're asking where is the promise of his coming but the reason why they're impatient because it wasn't revealed to them the mystery of and the process of his coming was not revealed to them and they have been coming to a union with him yes you see Christ is not going to marry someone he doesn't know he doesn't have a relationship with it amen he must know you you understand you must come into a union with him you must come into a relationship with him amen and if you if you come to a relationship within you you begin to understand his nature in his presence nature you understand the thing that he loves and you want to commune with him yeah we spoke on the series on prayer the prayer is not the easiest thing to do but when you love him and you want to talk to him you want to communicate with him amen you want to spend time in his presence amen amen whether it's reading his word whether it's fellowshiping around his word whether he's listening to a sermon you'll want to spend time in his presence thank you but it says so these people are impatient that's why you find people love sort of slandering the message picking in false and everything because why are they trying to understand this they want to satisfy their own lust In the Flesh when I run away from this word and go and satisfy the fleshly lust but the Lord is not slack amen concerning his promise and some men count slackness and I don't think the Lord is wrecked you can see the way the Lord is working yes the Lord is working with individual he's shaping and he's mowing individuals amen amen so that he came rightly fit into the body amen if they can be positionally placed into what he's called them for and when they are placed into the place that they they have been called then they can be used in the body amen amen that's why he's Communists I want to give us skill and understanding there was the age where you can say the people who don't know where they were going but in this age the mind of Christ has come down amen amen Airship has come down to lead the body yes amen but his long-suffering to us towards us not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance amen now you might look at the scripture and say why is this long suffering maybe there's more to come in what if it's not people from the outside but these people are already inside God wants us to truly repent amen God wants us to come to the knowledge of the church to come to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to walk into your inheritance amen like we read the book of Joshua chapter 18 how long will you be slacked to receive your inheritance concerning your inheritance so maybe long-suffing that we all come into our rightful positions amen not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come and the nights in the which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise any element shall melt with further needs he heard also when your works there are therein shall be burnt up seeing there that all you think shall be dissolved what manner of persons or J to be in all since coming back to the individual law it's all only conversation and godliness amen looking for listing unto the coming of the day of God die if this process hasn't been revealed to you because he said when you see these things look up your Redemption draw it nice so if you haven't seen this thing how would you be looking for the coming of the Lord I'm talking about the time when you come and take us away amen wearing the heavens Heavens resolved and the element shall melt with promise look for new events wearing Duality righteousness yes amen amen so you find that people are still looking at this mystery people and even in this day they still want to just leave out to say no just okay it's an event we believe the events but if you can't see that event in the scripture amen if you can't take what the property is saying and your property win and take it back to scripture then you can't recognize what's happening then you say no okay the prophet because the prophet said if we believe it but you've got to recognize who is here amongst us amen who came and United with us yes it was a mighty God unveiled before us amen a mighty God come to awaken us seven Thunders come to awaken us he comes to give us rapturing Faith he comes he come to show us our true identification thank you [Music] let's look at a few things that the properties saying about this event amen you know we spoke about that you read the scripture about long-suffering the church age in Ephesus was from 53 to 170 from 80 53 to 80 170. which equals 117 years for 1906 to 2023 he's actually 117 years so it's the same amount of years that was the shortest age so is this Tower the Lord is molding out the champion amen getting us ready to depart yes taking away everything that will keep us outbound amen taking out taking away everything from the flesh that is keeping us away from his presence because he wants you want us to separate from the tunnel nature if you want to experience God the presence of God in your life you're going to be separated from the heart of nature and that's what happened in this hour people didn't understand the peering of the Lord which are the mighty Angel clothed in the cloud amen and people didn't understand that they just saw this cloud now it was just some phenomenal cloud how could why would it be don't you think it'd be coincidental where the Lord will say the proprietary to the rights you'll speak to him now when you turn it to the right you can see it clearly amen thank you and it's very Prophet before that a year before that a few months before that he's telling you exactly what Vision he had and what what's the case taking he's taking revelation 10-1 amen amen he's taking that scripture because he's a scriptural prophet he must take you back to the scripture [Music] and he's and he's pointing this out in scripture he's not just showing you an event that happened he's taking you to scripture yes and the scripture and this prophet had the same color of fire that followed him must have a cloud because he had part of Moses Ministry amen amen he had to pull off fire which is God appearing in the pillar of fire god might also be in a cloud that's how he revealed himself amen so the child appeared is not something new it's something that was there it also came to the children of Israel amen right yes and he comes to reveal to us all these machines that are locked up in the Book of Daniel in the Book of Revelation which was there in simple form amen he comes to make this thing flame to us amen that's why it says in the days of the voice of the seven danger when it shall begin to sound the mystery will be finish the prophet says one day standing there picking the cockle bird off or Little Bull headers off my legs like it was that there's seven angels broke through from the sky and shook the place amen they come from eternity amen so rocks weighing 50 pounds rolled down the hillside they stood Seven Angels standing there commissioned me go back to bring these Messengers messages and said one by one they would meet and tell what happened and it did exactly that way and when they ascended up an eye like that went 30 miles high there and in the same day they took the picture of it science did it and went around the world it's a paradox but it was an absolute he tied me Taija into Jesus Christ winding my life into him I know it seems strange it always because what was that but he was waiting all his life for a message amen amen and what was the message was Christ amen this is what is record you can see Christ in every book of the Bible you see Christ throughout the Bible he is the principal team of the Bible amen he is the mystery of God's revealed amen in a message absolutely sing that in a message try to do God's service without being the will of God he says their Mysteries will be revealed in the last days when the seven angels message not when he stands out doing this but when he begins to sound is message not the years in preparation now not the first two pools but when he begins to sound is message these Mysteries then will be revealed and here they are not knowing them and you people are a witness of deaths and then in that great Observatory so that the world will be without they still wondering what happened in Tucson then big observatories took the picture of it up there still wondering what happened ask people to bring in all the evidence all the pictures and he began to study it and he still couldn't understand it when he was approached about it carry green and so forth he told them you're like full of superstition and you know what happened to him he ended up committing suicide they still put it in the paper does anybody know anything about what how it could have happened there is no fog up there there's no air there's no moisture 30 miles up in the air it shall be signed in the heaven above amen when God is doing something you must show his signs in the heaven above first and when these things take place see now when he showed the signs what happened is that when the science earthquakes in diverse places you know what happened after this the next incident judgment struck the West Coast and he didn't stop from there we had an Earthquakes for an Earthquakes we had pestilences we're having all this amateur tribulations upon the Earth then shall appear the sign in the heaven the son of man amen that day Luke the son of man would reveal himself again and the world looked like Thunderman tomorrow oh my now let's go back to Sodom and gomorro what happened there before the destruction of Sodom and gomorro he appears to Abraham amen amen gives them a name change amen amen and reveal discern The Secret of Sarah's Hearts all right but before he leaves Abraham and he and remember because after that they can have a body change but before he leaves Abraham is gonna reveal to April his judgment now upon Saddam and tomorrow amen but before even he's gonna pronounce judgment but he's also going to go sin he's investigating angels amen and that's why we got all these unidentified flying objects they don't realize what it is they're investigating angels to come in and why so much now in the day when he's like Sodom again it goes to come and investigate the condition that's here and he's telling Abraham what he's going to do there's a spirit of Christ steps in Abraham what he does is he is convinced now there's going to be a destruction because Abraham know who this is because he's seeing Three Angels but he's saying my Lord amen we see there were seven angels that formed the top but we know we say my Lord amen we know it's a mighty Angel amen the seven spirits of God from his throne come up and make up the mighty angel of God Amen we find that Abraham is saying my Lord and then he tells Ibraham this is what I'm going to do to sort of in tomorrow and Abraham immediately starts to plead watch now this is the spirit of Christ because he's pleading now he wants his family to save and he's asking Lord a 50-day will you say no then he's barking Abraham is bargaining with God not that same the same experience really believing that the destruction coming upon the Earth [Music] and if the world is in a certain condition he's going to destroy the Earth even as Peter said the elements of the Earth is going to burn up with fire I'm your father but our family is to be saved our loved wants to be saved how many of us can see the day approaching amen so he's bugged me with God but Abraham is nowhere near the destruction whether the destruction is taking place but he goes there and then the Angels going to Solomon you learn the story from there [Music] but what happened after that is a body change amen amen right in the time of judgment the pronunciation of judgment when he goes when the Angels go down there there's a body chain foreign that day they took all across Southern United States and Mexico a day and now in Life Magazine still I must speak to them but he declares it in the heaven before he does it on Earth he always does that he shows his signs in the heavens persons another code he says return home for thus say the Lord this is what the Lord was saying the seven mystery that's been hid in the Bible all these years his denominations and everything God is going to open your seven Mysteries to us in the seventh seals there was that Circle coming up from the earth like a Mist forming when he did it went Plum up into the mountain being a circle on Westward from the way it come sign is founded after a while 30 miles die and 25 miles across it really amazing smile just exactly in the circle of the pyramid and the other day standing there turned the picture to the right here's it now he turned the picture to the right and there is Jesus as he was in the seven Church ages amen the white big one showing Supreme deity is Alpha and Omega is the first and the last now how many of you all took the picture and showed it to your friend your family or anybody with a message wasn't the real friend said can you see Christ was they really taken by that it's not for everybody you can show them you're showing them a picture right using the image there yeah today is just a picture [Music] to you is a reality amen not just because of a picture amen because he wasn't even there when the prophet was there he wasn't there when the picture was taken how come you believe it because you are having a relationship with the one who came down amen you are having a personal encounter amen so we're saying the angel of God until you have a personal encounter with him and feel his presence and acknowledge his presence then someone can treat the angel of God is here it will be nothing to you he'll have no effect to you amen amen but until you experience it experience his presence recognize his nature recognize when he's breaking the bread amen when the world is being opened amen if you recognize this nature then it'll have an effect in your life so he's speaking about the mystery of the 1960s his historical incident but behind the mystery what effect has it had from 1963 right now in 2023 which is 60 years now what effect has it has in the last 60 years did he have an effect which was just something that appeared there he says on the other day standing there turned the picture to right and there he is Jesus he was in the seven Church ages the white wig on showing Supreme deity is helpful Omega is the first and the last is the Supreme judge of all eternity standing there to confirm the message of this hour and there shall be lies about the healing time what's it all about what was it I win Westward the same that same Mountain passing upward Banks were there he said throw up Iraq says to Mr wood thus say the Lord you shall see the glory of God the next day standing there a whirlwind came down and blasted the mountain out rocks cut the top of the trees off about three or four feet above my head make three big blasts and the brothers come running over there was about 15 men standing there preachers and everything else what was it he said what was it I said judgment is starting the West Coast so you see to you was Redemption revealed because he came to put claims on you amen come to the title did to bring you back to your condition your rightful condition amen it comes to make you air voting he come to bring you back to your endemic to have dominion again to show you who you really are amen but to the world it was judgments to the one that rejected him it was judgments he said about two days off today earthquake almost sang Alaska what is this light up on the sunset mountain in Colorado Coronado Forest of Arizona what is the strange thing that happened up there that the people has been driving east from West picking up the rocks that laid around there where it struck and every one of them everyone wrote three corners on it that it tore off they're laying on desks on paperweights Across the Nation what is a strange thing upon sunset Mountain in the Coronado Forest Junior Jackson listening in you remember the dream he had that I interpreted going towards the setting of The Sun you know Junior Jackson's dream and this happened on Sunset Mountain it's the evening time sunset time the sunset message through a setting of History a setting of Prophecy rather being fulfilled and it shall be light at the evening time upon sunset Mountain in the Coronado Forest 40 miles north of Tucson get on the map and see if it's Sunset Peak day that's exactly where it happened I never know it till the other day everything that that shall never die constantly unrolling itself from the very thing happened to the picture being Jesus standing between us now exactly on Sunset mountain in the sunset light the evening light has come God vindicating himself what it is is the fact that God in Christ Our wife [Music] upon him as we talked in Revelation 1 the Supreme deities supreme authority no other voice no other God no other nothing in him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodies the angel themselves was his weak amen what's happened upon Mount Sunset God confirming his word that's what all this noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelation 10 1. [Music] in the days of the voice of the sounding of the Seven Angels message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden revelation of mystery of Revelation 10 1-7 the last message of the last Church is fulfilled exactly what's in the speech and Luke 17 30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed amen amen so you see God is thoroughly vindicatedness right and you can take a physical picture and you can show people you can take the scripture and you can show people but this was only for a special class of people because this was a union amen he's come down for a Unity come for those that has come to play that he has rightful claims over amen amen he comes with those that were written in the lamb Book of Life amen you come to reveal your true identity when he went when he came down to Abraham he didn't go to everybody he went down to hit him alone amen and the next thing it was destruction you saw them in tomorrow so when it comes to reveal himself to us it's an individual walk amen on Sunday I spoke about being consistent having a continuity and being Progressive the only time you can be have continuity is reading amen if he is leading the way he said I said my angel before you if the angel of God is leading the way there will be a continuity [Music] guess who you know his presence is there there'll be consistency if he is in it amen if he is in your life if the holy ghost in your life you'll have consistency you won't be one day on the one day having a Revival with the water the next day you're down there'll be a consistent Christian walk amen if you got the Holy Ghost and there'll be a progressive walk because he is the one to come yeah in this hour to give us skill and understanding amen amen and your work you started off as a baby as a sincere babe in Christ then you begin to become a toddler then you begin to become knowing more like a teenager then you come to maturity amen because he put you on the tutors amen because while you were living in the adoption age so what was this very the mystery the mystery of this historical event amen that the fullness of God Has Come Amen in this hour it's come he's coming his fullness of his word he come under the first two pools there was just to attract the attention amen but yeah it comes with a special class of people amen he's come for the rainbow trout amen amen this this is the third pool amen this is the opening of the word amen there's some this is something he's not going to explain yeah this is something is going to stop because in Jewish season the same angel of God is working now to the fivefold ministry come and make these things flame yes he's going to come and take the same coats amen and he's going to make this clothes clear for your day amen you're going to make the courts clear for the hour that you're living in correct amen and you're gonna say now that's why you could say when he's preaching the Seven Seals at the end he says now e must increase I must decrease amen amen because it's time to recognize this presence amongst us because what he's doing we are the one like like Mary said behind to me according to Thy word conception when we come to the union conception takes place yes and then what happened Christ must be formed in US amen Christ must be reproduced again and that's how Christ will begin to continue his work there must be a continuity amen Christ was there working a month the apostles in the book of Acts Christ must be here because now they are to first come arrest there was a falling away of the faith and they had to become a full Restoration in this hour and after restoration he comes and making himself known amen because now he wants to come into your union in a time when people are restored that's when he comes on the scene and the type of full restoration he comes on the scene to come into a union with a bride amen their Christ will be formed in this many membered body amen it's a time where Egypt has come down yes yes the time when the mind of Christ has come down amen from eternity amen that's where the scripture said be not conform any longer to the pattern of this world of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind because now the mind of Christ has come down and show you another world all you brought of good was this world all your life you learned about things in this world yes you learn about how to survive in this world right but what you didn't realize that while he was living in a scientific world it was influenced by Satan it was influenced by demon power amen From Another World this Dimension was being influenced but just like that he comes from another world Amen to give us skill and understanding he comes from another world with seven Thunders to awaken us out of that spiritual Amnesia where we didn't realize that we really come from God we didn't realize that we are supernatural beings trapped in a flesh body we didn't realize that we bypassed our theophany but now when we come to this full realization amen when we come to the spiritual realization it brings us into such a faith amen that one of these days amen from this natural we're gonna go into this we are we are now tapping into the supernatural amen right now while we are living on this world we are now seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that you no longer walking in the Carlo amen amen you might be looking like a person like every other human being in this flesh body but you are tapping into the supernatural because why this was a supernatural message there was a supernatural event that took place in 1963. it wasn't just a scientific thing that the way science looking at it it wasn't just something to do with the atmosphere or anything it was a supernatural event come for a supernatural people amen so all these years he was trapped here but when these messages come your way it began to open your eyes of understanding you began to see more clearly once you were looking generally amen but now you begin to see more clearly and as the days are approaching it's becoming more clearer to us amen and the more that you're recognizing his presence is yeah amen the more is going to lead you the more and if you're wanting to work in your life then that's why he's speaking to you to you say consecrate yourself be obedient to his words obedient to his to the instruction that is giving to you because remember it's come to give you skill and understanding amen and he's instructing you week after week how to come into preparation for him to use you amen if you want to experience his presence in your life then follow his instructions amen amen and provoke him not amen as we read in the book in Exodus what did he say his name he said I send my angel before thee to keep me in the way and to bring thee in the place which I have prepared amen if you take that for us now he's taking us on his Exodus journey and he's taking us to the place that he's prepared for us he said Beware of him that that means you need to be sensitive amen be sensitive to when he's speaking to you sensitive in the way he's working amen and obey his voice he's not gonna how he's speaking to you this is here amen provoke him nuts the Bible said believe not the holy spirit of God whereby he has sealed until the day off Redemption amen how are we provoking how are we provoking God did not give us a filthy Spirit by the Holy Spirit things that he will take away his flight provoking nuts you know the things that the Holy Spirit wouldn't entertain the things that you wouldn't the places that you wouldn't want to be around the atmosphere that you wouldn't want to be around provoke him not out of the children of Israel provoke him there was murmuring you heard the message the other day they will keep murmuring don't go like complaining grounding and be grateful for what he has done for us amen thank the Lord for what he's done for US 60 years now and from where he's taking this message sorry the progression in this message you can see the progression now in a message for this past 60 years nothing is stagnant in the world Amen this message never denominates but it was a continuous work of the Holy Ghost amen and as each he generally as each age or each year past God revealed what was what was needed for that hour and as it's progressing more God will reveal more and more amen [Music] amen even though the worker for marriage would be stagnated by now yes one is a progression amen he said Beware of female obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression my name is in him amen so he said so give us clear understanding but I love this party everybody says for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites and the hitchhikes and the parasites and the Canaanites and their invites and the Jeopardy said I will cut them off amen nothing is going to stand before if you are just obeying his voice and the angel of God is going before you nothing is going to stand before you and your inhabitants amen amen of everything that will enter your inhabitants imagine you're walking along this journey amen how are you walking along your land of inevitance and you obeying his voice and you are sensitive to his leading then nothing is going to stand in your way amen amen that's why he's anointed us for this hour in every age he's given an anointing that's why there was 68 million could be mattered that's why Louis aged he could say the Justice Angel could believe in sanctification and you come in the age of anointed to Fly Above All This demon power there's 200 million demons looking around amen you can sew above because you're anointed amen for the hour amen so what was that mystery amen the mystery was Christ and his bride amen the mystery was for a union between Christ and his bride because the head has come to tough tail with the body amen The Headstone has come down to cap the body to be the perfect pyramid amen something that wasn't done in any other age but it's coming this day so this is the age where there is no excuse there is no excuse about understanding the word of God because this is the age where the mind of Christ has include his age to be ignorant of this thing in Wesley's age it was ignorant of these things this is not the age to be ignorant in the world when he is here to give us feel and understanding amen he is here to show us things that wasn't seeing in all the other ages amen this is the age we come down and reveal all his mystery truths but yet the people are still scorning at it amen says he said now this message of Malachi for and Revelation 10 7 is going you know the coach he's going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the heart of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10. which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed Mysteries trips and literally turned the heart of the children to the Pentecostal father amen now those that are not identifying the cloud with revelation 10. and just looking at okay maybe it was a supernatural event and uh William Brenner and did that identify in the description how are these Mysteries if they miss the one that come in this hour amen because one appeared to the prophet in this hour he said the one I've been waiting for all my life amen I've been waiting for the message the notable one amen I've been waiting for this all my life because he's waiting for the gift all his life you're waiting for Christ to come make himself alone he knew that this wasn't ordinary amen he wasn't an ordinary event that's why he said this was the most it was the most Supernatural event in his life apart from all the Medicals and everything that took place this wasn't an ordinary event but now you the ones that are rejecting or they can't see that but the scripture how are these mystery truths gonna be revealed to them amen he said realizing that our time is limited here especially for those friends who are listening in my telephone I would like to call your attention this morning a picture that some time ago was taken about the camera of the vision that I had here at the Tabernacle of living Indiana to Arizona where I was to meet in the form of a permanent seven angels not knowing what would happen later when I got there thinking it was the end of my life that no one could stand the blast and I'm sure all of you are acquainted with the story and then in Sabino Canyon one morning like this one in prayer there has been a sword placed in my head and said this is the word and the sword of the word later the angel appeared as was prophesied you know the story we said teaching sword yes yes amen yes which was going to be the worst later the Angels appeared as was prophesied and at the same time a great cluster of light left where I was standing and moved 30 miles high in the air around the surface like wings of the angels and drawed into the skies a shape of a pyramids in the same constellation of angels that appeared time took the picture all the way from Mexico when it moved from northern Arizona where the holy spirit said I was standing will be standing 40 miles Northeast of Tucson and he went into the air and a Life magazine in fact the teacher in you must take something away in the spears whether where there could be no moisture where there could be no evaporation or anything 30 miles high and 27 miles across and coming up from where those angels were now they asked to know now they asked to know signs to one of them in Tucson wants to know any significance but I didn't tell them you all know knew it it's all performed but it wasn't for them it was for you amen amen you see it wasn't for everybody [Music] the Rapture is not a public show the Rapture is not for the whole world to know it's a secret this is for Christ and his bride this is a secret catching away this was an invisible Union it wasn't for the whole world the world is thinking things are still the same so the father fell asleep offers that began to rise up while there was coughing there was a union taking place [Music] your name I knew you not there was no Union what is the evidence of the Union there must be Christ reproduced again you cannot hide a mother that is that expecting a child cannot hide at a certain season right there comes the time when she cannot hide the pregnancy amen oh there was a time when you started to rejoice and you started to see those things you started to Bubble Up amen he started to Glow amen but Christ must be reproduced again amen amen because why let's see that was in there amen and now when it comes to food bearing time we had to bring forth a fruit of his kind the denomination plus they Siege they had they saw us with the Branham went and he was a plunder too amen and he saw his seed in his time but in a time when it came for food bearing time amen whatever seed was there the fruits are showing now you can't hide fruits all these years but it was X there was an exit out of the message Because by the fruit you shall know that amen amen because they had to be gathered up and we have to be together now he said he didn't tell them it wasn't for you it was for you so you see for a special class of people and so there he spoke to me and said seven of seals will be opened the seven Mysteries seven four mystery of the Bible have been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed is blessing the hearing this mystery manage divorce certain seed in all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by God himself yet opened those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in Christ in the beginning and how it will be reveal in the last days and now as this went up we have the picture outside on the plot but then I have the picture laying fears in jail if you notice that live magazine had it but I wonder if my audience visible here has ever really looked at the picture see in the way it should be you remember I was preaching when the vision came upon the subject of the Book of Revelation when the old judges where we see in Jesus in Revelation when we started out to the Seven Seas of the church it is rather just prior to the opening of the seventh seal Christ was telling would hear like the world now you know what he's talking about today spoke about him coming as the judge you know to the whole English judges he came as Supreme deity what he's trying to say there now to us it's revealed right and to those that is not revealed and though to those that rejected it and and what is dangerous in this our people have blasphemed they made a mockery of it they made a mockery of Israel today now he is also there as a judge together Supreme judge of the Earth amen but it comes to you with Redemption it comes as a redeeming Angel to you yes you come to the Judgment Angel to them amen one one to one part is coming as a redeeming Angel one part is coming as a judgment Angel amen same Cloud showing up there amen Redemption and judgment depends what you're calling to amen that's why I say what a grateful people we ought to be amen now they can go on debating and they still can go on division it's too late a union has already taken place [Music] amen we see ourselves many walking out of the scriptures amen amen because you come to show us our identity right and now we see ourselves walking out of the scriptures and Christ reproduce once again continuing his work amen you can't go no time to wait for anyone yeah yeah he's going to work to do amen and Christ is working in those that is called out in those that will happen to his voice Amen in those that will be of vision to him in those that will take him at his word in those that will be certain of his words in those that will be convinced and concerned Christ is working with them to make them a super race yes amen amen those that will use in this hour and he will send his Angel before them and he will cut off everything that will come on in your way everything that will lead to your walk you will cut it off amen I don't know what your circumstances tonight maybe your circumstance might be a financial circumstance you will cut it off he will make you will open his window of heaven and pour out his blessings upon you your circumstance may be because of the Salvation of your loved ones he will cut that Satan trying to put all of them he will say you have rightful claims over there I'm applying the token over there I'm claiming them yes yes yes whatever your circumstances tonight he said if you will obey him amen amen if you will obey him he will go before you and he will cut them off all things that were in the your inheritance the rain falls on the just and the unjust amen the unjust I enjoying the rain that's supposed to be falling for us amen it's falling for you he's saying that he's sending His blessings because of you because of his love for you but they are just enjoying it not not because he wants to sell it for them but because it's there they can enjoy it because that's how the nature of God works the rain will just fall amen but he's falling for you amen you need to catch it amen amen you need to catch it when he's when his anointing is coming when his blessings are coming you need to catch it amen that's what I'm saying these things when you look at these dates when we look at the significance of what happened to us these things are special yes amen and we caught it amen amen and it began to have an effect in our lives and then now when we caught it we began to see ourself in a word we began to see the third pool amen the opening of the word and when we saw the opening of the word the same word that we're receiving as we receive the mechanics and the mechanics and the mechanics and now we're seeing the effects of the Dynamics amen because it come to enjoy us with power from an eye that's why I said check the book from the angels and each of it and then it becomes to become effective in your life when he says now thou must prophesy again amen before Nations before tongues before Kings because why that same word that you're eating that you've been eating up that you've been enjoying you haven't been grumbling about this world you haven't been murdering about his words but you have been receptive to what this world you began to appreciate his word you began to digest his word and then now it began to have an effect in your life amen amen this is that season where the word is taking effect now so don't let people say where where is a sign of his coming because since the father fell asleep since our father Branham goes off the scene things didn't remain the same amen the Holy Ghost has been working and working and working bringing us into our into our land of inevitance and positionally placing us amen now we just have to let let loose and let him have his way amen let him come and use and say Lord use more of me take control of my life come into every open every door in your heart don't close the door don't shut him off say Lord come into every joy in March yes a door in a door if the door in the door is shut open it up to him so Lord I want to offload Lord and you may come in fullness yes and come and use me amen come and give me skill and understanding come make me understand your word Lord Jesus come Lord and put Place me in the place of my inhabitants and use me Lord that I may cultivate this land Within Me Lord yes yes when the Israel came back from the from being scattered from all the nations after World War II they came into a desolate land but they began to cultivate the land they began to use this skill that they had and whatever skill god-given skill God has given them each one used a skill and became successful in their skill and they became fruitful in that land that God has given them if you take Israel and you take Arabia you take the Muslim nations around him the the the the the the desert Nation around them that's desolate but look at Israel and look at their fruits look at their flowers look at the things that they have become fruitful in look at the type of engineering they got they're taking what God they're telling that God has given them they've been using it and they cultivated the land and they became prosperous so what God has given you you what gift is given you amen you need to become skillful in it you need to cultivate it amen then you can have success in it so you've got to recognize the way God has placed you the way he's positioned you and cultivated amen I believe God has given each one of us apart to play in the body God has given each one of us a gift but you come now to kept the body amen the mind of Christ is here and he's the one that's leading us he's guiding us he's giving us skill and understanding we got to find ourselves now in the rightful position of inheritance amen and cultivate cultivate the land cultivate the gift amen and then you can be useful you may not trust that you've been blessed tonight just thought I'd share these things because of the significance of the day today to add a special but I don't believe anything has been stagnant amen I believe it's a progression amen I believe there's a progression there's a continuity and there's consistency is possible amen as I said emphasis was the shortest age 117 years we have now reached 117 years in this late from 1906 to 2023 we have reached 117 years so and if you look at the way the Lord has been dealing with us trying to shape us trying to mold us try to get us remember for Samson to have been infected in what God called him to do he had to have a Nazarite vowel right every time the angel of the Lord appeared to the prophet or his brother will come in Provident be constipated to him for us now if you want to see and experience its presence amongst us and we want him to use us we need to consecrate our life together amen now a prisoner of Jesus Christ because of all that he knew of God got the knowledge that he had the theology that he had took it out of him until he could go into there to the desert in the back part of the desert in Arabia and God could reveal himself to him amen God had to take out the knowledge that Moses had for 40 years yes Amen in Egypt God took it out God has to take out all this worldly thinking all his legacy and knowledge that we have because with all let us here can show us through its sides he can never understand God the great excited us after now he can't understand the strong but we have to Humble ourselves come and by faith we believe yet we wasn't there yet we never witnessed it with our eyes what makes us believe it it is a gift of God Amen Revelation is the gift of God God has personally made it known to us amen and we appreciate him for that we can give up like the world we could have been confused like the world we could have been not understanding what is all these things but he's come to revealing to us but what is what is the evidence now that all this is true anyone ask you what is the evidence I've come into a union today I've come to know him in the way that you don't know me in the world the way the world doesn't know I've come to know him personally I've come to know him that we have interaction with him I come to know him the way he revealed himself to me in a way it's working through my life in the way it's transformed my life with his power of transformation amen the way he has come to me it's a personal thing amen amen thank God Amen [Applause] we sing the song new things are declared this over the substitute [Music] [Music] a new thing I've been declared I know very soon I'll be ratchet out of here the angel of God is here our souls into being invisible the inaudible being conceivable makes you believe for the impossible oh [Music] the angel of God not seen for 2 000 years he's just fixing things for us to lead [Music] these waving visions of ourselves before us so we can walk step by step into what we before new things I've been declare I I know very soon I'll be raptured out again the angel of God is here leading our souls into [Music] oh in this new day amen amen aren't you glad for this new day let's give the Lord a good answer for praise amen Amen brother Joshua thank you for the blood of the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen that's a revelation to us amen hidden from the wise and The Prudent of the world and if you know the prophet of God tells us that even though Revelation chapter 8 is silence under that seventh seal this is a direct quote now he says the setting of it is found in Revelation 10. amen he says the setting of that seven seal is found in Revelation 10. amen hallelujah so we know amen that even as we begin to read this and understand all of these things we are caught up in that mystery of that sincere that is why you can show somebody pictures they won't understand this if you notice the prophet says if you look at the picture the way it should be I mean if you read that quote but the Joshua just read it now he says if you look at the picture the way it should be I look at many churches and they slept the picture this way [Music] yet the Lord told the prophet and it is the rising of the sun he preaches and he says turn it to the right amen amen so they're not even looking at the cloud the right way they want to look at it the way science took it yeah but you look at it the way science took it you can't see nothing but when you look at it the right way amen amen you see Christ now if you notice something there in Revelation chapter 10 he says another Mighty angel came down from heaven he's coming for a purpose amen he's coming with a purpose amen hallelujah amen amen so he's coming from heaven he is crossing Dimensions amen hallelujah is not coming in a spacecraft but he's traveling through Dimensions the prophecy is faster than you can blink your eyes there the Angels were there amen hallelujah and you know the Angel The Voice not I don't want to preach here now but I want to tell you this Heaven and Earth were connected amen if you read Revelation 10 because there's a voice from Heaven speaking to John first he tells him don't write and then it's fixed him again and he tells him go and take the book from the end of the Angel and eat the book now in order to eat you must be hungry in order to eat you must have an appetite amen otherwise somebody's going to be Force feeding you so the instruction is given to John and the instruction is given directly from heaven take the book and eat the book amen so it's up to John now whether he wants to go and listen to that instruction now 28th of February 1963 and Revelation 10 is tied together amen but I want you to know that Revelation 10 is not happening on one particular day Revelation 10 will go all the way up until Revelation 11 is fulfilled amen it's a period of time amen because over that period of time many Johns many people who make up John are gonna come to take the book so it's not just one particular day it's from 63 all the way to now to 23. amen and even up until Revelation 11 is fulfilled let's give the Lord a hand type of Praise amen so he says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothes with a cloud amen we can go into much more detail in that but we want to stop there and close it amen so just there come down from heaven down down down is coming down and the glory of the Lord is coming down when the sins we get to pray and the Lord will have his way it's the glory of the Lord is coming down oh the glory of the Lord is coming down yes when the sin it's tied to prayer and the Lord will have his way [Music] he's coming down and the glory of the Lord is coming down yes when the sins begin to pray and the Lord will have his way and the glory of the Lord is coming down amen aren't you grateful for that amen hallelujah oh let's just sing and worship Him

flowing from our mouths and our lips Amen to give him glory and to give him praise amen that's another key to your Victory is when a Believer can be able to defend the Lord and Just Praise Him and glorify his name in fact I believe I cannot stop praising him amen I just can't stop praising his name I just can't stop glorifying his name amen you can't get a Believer to keep quiet amen hallelujah
