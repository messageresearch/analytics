good people who wanted to see this day oh yes lord and they hear the things that we do yes but it was never permitted for them dear god help us now dear father as we just get into thy words thank you lord we are anticipating from above their god yes not from a man if they see me dear god yes then i've missed the point amen i will persuade god for them to see you i'm praying all this for you in jesus christ's name amen amen amen may i just take this opportunity to greet all of you in jesus name again amen amen i'm not going to take much of your time my words as a man they come to nothing i wonder if we have got our bibles to turn to the book of daniel chapter 2. i will read verse 9 but if you will not make known unto me the dream there is but one decree for you for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and i shall know that you can show me the interpretation thereof may the lord bless the region of israel you can check yourself i just formulated the subject here [Music] which are entitled go and call daniel there are wonderful things that our prophet actually speaks about where the scene is opening tonight in a city called babylon brother branham says babylon is found at the beginning of the bible that is in the book of genesis babylon is found in the middle part of the bible that is where we just opened in the book of daniel amen babylon is also found at the end amen amen in the book of revelation where we see the mystery babylon why babylon found in the book of genesis the prophet says the devil has got a beginning there is somewhere where he started and there is somewhere where he is going to come to an end [Music] so we are not we are not shocked about this that's why we are not supposed to fear the devil amen because he has got an end amen but the god that we are serving brother sister is ominous omnipresent amen the one who does not have a beginning the one who does not have an end so in other words babylon is found in the whole bible that's what the prophet says so tonight we are seeing something strange taking place in babylon the king nebuchadnezzar he had wise men whom he had grouped some called sorcerers others in the group of astrologers some the charities and others the magicians all these four groups they were the wise men who could come and yes certain words to the king but i want you to understand one thing tonight they were always telling the king lies amen you know you can lie and go on with a lie but let me tell you something it won't go forever one day it will come to an end amen so this is exactly what we are seeing where an advocate nasa he had a dream and he does not come to tell his wise man instead he wanted them to tell him what he dreamt then you would know they are going to interpret i'm so happy with what the wise men actually said to the king they said there is no king who ever requested such an impossible thing from his wise man [Music] it was an impossible thing to them you know what i'm saying but in the middle of such things there is a prophet who was sent by god amen in the headquarters of the devil there was a prophet who was not recognized who was not even in the category of these wise men amen when they had been stranded to the extremes [Music] they remembered that there is a prophet in a babylon so there is a man ariel who was sent to go and inquest from daniel and you know the whole story daniel was in a position to come and speak to the king and tell him what he dreamt so there are wonderful things that i'm going to tell you about because it stretches to our day where we are living brother branham says it was divided into five governments that image which king nebuchadnezzar dreamt of the head of god the arms and the breasts of silver then we come to the belly which was of brass then we come to the legs which were of iron then lastly the fifth government which was defeat where there was iron and a clay that could not mingle together you know what i'm saying so i'm not going to be speaking about the other four governments because they came to pass yes amen i'm going to talk about what i have witnessed in my day that i am living with what the prophet has said that is the fifth government yes iron and clay that cannot mingle together brother branham says in 1956 when they gathered at united nations for a summit there were two leaders one representing the east the other one representing the west the east were being represented by a russian prime minister by the name nikita crusher in the crucifer in russian language it means clay the west was being represented by united states president by the name dwight essentia it means amen brother branham says the meeting was ongoing they could not agree to such an extent that a crew chef took out his shoe and he beat the table there was nothing else that he could see which he was going to use to build the table he did not use a hammer he did not use a book he used a shoe why a shoe we are talking about iron and clay that are not mingling together right at the feet you know what i'm saying yes amen i want you to i want to draw your attention 1999. russia invaded the chechnya remember what russia was trying to do was trying to claim all those states which used it to be a soviet union to become russia you understand so 1999 russia invaded the chechnya and the prime minister of the president of america by the name billy clinton on that time he actually stated that russia was supposed to withdraw their troops from chechnya and the prime minister of russia by the name boris your team he answered billy clinton by saying russia is not going to withdraw their troops from chechnya if you want to see who russia is let us meet in chechnya brother sister why am i talking about this we are eyewitnesses we are just seeing what the prophet actually said coming to pass right no matter how small the political issue is russia america they are not coming to me all together they are not in agreement terms you change the president you change the prime ministers but still they are not agreeing remember 1956 it was a crucifix now 1999 we have got billy clinton and buddhism thing but still they are not agreeing why is this going on like that amen that's why we had a prophet in our day you remember the vision that you saw 1933 watch russia watch russia keep your focus on the king of the north they are not agreeing 30 december 2006 [Music] you know that saddam hussein was executed by america prior to the execution of saddam hussein there was only one country that refused to join america to go against saddam hussein in baghdad it was russia you know what i'm saying they are not agreeing i read one newspaper in swaziland that time in the world news and it was saying russia was a peace supporting iraq by sending arms and ammunition my point is this had nothing to do with russia and this had nothing to do with america but why russia and america could not actually mingle together no matter how small the issue was claim in the island that could not mingle together you know what i'm saying can i just read you a quote um seven church edges page 237 the prophet says let me give you a little something on the iron and clay remember when crusher beat his shoe on the desk at the united nations that is 1956 well there were five eastern nations and the five question khrushchev spoke for the east and the present sn1 for the west in the russian language khrushchev is clay and the sn-1 means iron the two main leaders of the world the two big doors of the fit of iron and clay we are side by side we are in the end of it all then he goes on to say who is able to make war with the beast now there are a present some great names in the world there are some mighty nations but right now rome is calling the tune the pope is on the driver's seat and his power is going to increase no one can make war against him russia america they will never mingle together this is what we have actually witnessed in the day that we are living in that despite the fact that you can change whosoever leader and put another mask they still don't agree 2014 russia continued with their political agenda to claim all those states of soviet union by invading ukraine how many remember this just recently 2014 they invaded ukraine they took southern crimea and they made them russian citizens yes obama said russia is supposed to withdraw their troops if they don't we are going to sanction them the prime minister of russia had been changed it was no more policy on sin it was the vladimir putin we're still there today putin said sanctions or no sanctions russia is still going to move into ukraine and they were sanctioned they cannot agree we have beheaded a prophet who told us all these things no sorcerer no astrologer no magician could actually come up with this if he had to take a daniel of our day anointed from above who could study the mind of god and he come and tell the people russia america are not going to agree till that rock which was seen coming down from the mountain to crush the image right at the defeat any network was jesus christ amen so in other words what it means is this political disposition is going to continue till the lord jesus christ becomes space yes you know what i'm saying we are eyewitnesses one thing that is making slightness in the message people don't really believe that brother branham was a true prophet you know what i'm saying maybe because they never saw something practical that they can actually hold onto may i just say this with what i have seen with what i'm telling you today i actually faced it in lovely to see what is going to happen i can actually stand here to say i am an eyewitness of what i have seen amen of what was said by the prophet of god russia america are never going to agree in whatever way and is this not the thing that is going to make russia drop the atomic bomb into vatican city and destroy them within an hour's time the prophet says this is the lord amen mark of the beast preached in 1954 yes i'm just about to close i don't take much time [Music] hallelujah still in the same spoken word becoming church age page 193 the prophet says thou art this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall be a rule over all the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaker in pieces and subdue it all things [Music] and where's the also has the feet and toes part of porter's clay government as you see the lakes there too rome got divided into east rome and west rome they were both powerful but as we go down to the elastic government the fifth government they are losing power that's why they are now seen mingled with partly clay and partly iron because they are losing power you know what i'm saying amen but all this brother sister is coming to an end i can delightfully say we are right at the end amen that's why i entered my subject go and call daniel where the astrologers have failed the magicians had failed the socialism failed they are lying in the denominations promises that they tell people you know what i'm saying i see somebody suffering from stomachache [Music] you can stand up how many people come to church suffering from stomachaches how many people come to suffering from headaches in johannesburg there is a man who even affect the death they put him in a coffin you know what i'm saying i later only saw a headline written that man is now dead truly dead you don't play around with god with brother branham it wasn't real you know what i'm saying i remember brother perry green said one thing that he convinced him to follow this message brother branham had called you for a prayer line and there came a young girl no eyes only holes you know what i'm saying brother branham said no it did not have fit i think it was defeat here i'm sorry it was defeat did not have the feet so brother branham said can we close our eyes and brother berry green said i did not close my eyes i wanted to see how this one was going to be possible so what the prophet did is he did as if he did not care about the child he let off the child like dropping the child and the defeat was created hello we save a miracle-working god amen we are witnesses in this day yes can we just stand on our feet i don't know if you know the song let me walk with you jesus don't you ever leave me alone without you ever i can't do anything [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] could oh make it [Music] oh [Music] foreign can you sing for the last time [Music] oh i could never make [Music] i'd be glad for the word amen amen the beginning and the ending of the gentile dispensation praise the lord god has spoken to us showed us how the gentile nations arose from babylon is peace [Music] and coming down the means of persians [Music] iran today amen coming right down showing us in the time amen what a glorious thing that we can witness that today the iron and play and is it by coincidence those names were crucial and eisenhower how can it be coincidence amen [Music] so we thank god the the message that came down will make us draw our attention to the nations around the world what is taking place because it's gonna finish off with the nations god is waiting enough for all these things to set in life we believe it's called a bride the blood is already called out that's right so we're waiting for everything to put in place right we know there's going to be a uh covenant signed with israel and then right who's gonna sign the covenant rome so they're gonna make some deal right so many of you know the first of september monday was uh easterly being made again with israel for the first time at the israeli airplane flowing to dubai and dubai has now made a peace deal with israel that's right and peace deal with israel right so there's a big story behind it [Music] now i don't know how many of you follow the news and watching all these things that jared kushner is the son-in-law of donald trump and he's a jew young fellow he is his number one adviser [Music] donald trump's advisor he's a jew and he's going around making all his deals also there so when the plane landed in uh dubai he is there with the other delegates and uh one statement he made talking about all the the muscle you reckon we are all from one god he actually says that we are all from one god now they worship allah amen so that's not our god or that's not the jewish god that's right man so he said no we are all one god you know we were children of one god and he's gonna make a peace deal right so they're gonna sign this peace deal in america in a few days or weeks or so israel and dubai the arab united emirates yes right so we may assign it in america that is a peach deal amen right so now they're going to be free uh flights from or not free flights free movement of flight from dubai to israel israel to dubai they could have business deals and trades and everything else and they can fly from anywhere from israel or dubai to other parts of the world but the other main reason about the speech deal there's a more important reason now if you look at the map over there now for a while israel was planning to attack iran because of the nuclear weapons but now for them for their flights to go all the way from israel to go there and you know start that whichever way they're going to start the war and fly back they couldn't make it it's going to be too long for them to fly there and then they need to fly back for the plane was for long but now dubai is right across iran amen right across iran there's a shipping road there i don't know what they call the waterway the gulf of homas or something iran is right over there and dubai is on the other side so israel and america are going to have the bases over there and it will be very easy for them to attack iran and come back that's another main reason [Music] see now there's ah there's another nation there's oman next to dubai they around the corner is roman they're also going to make a deal with israel see another nation bahrain is also a saudi arabia for israel and then russia you know russia has been shielding syriana the prime minister or president of syria america should have killed him long ago but russia was there he called for russia to protect him and there's a certain portion of of syria they can't go there and fight but you learn a lot of fighting in damascus and the other part the western part but the other part they can't get to his name is basa right they can't get to him because the russians are protecting him so you see everything is playing out with politics the nations so i believe that's what we are waiting for but we know revelation 13 is a beast right that's rising up out of water out of the water from the people which is america amen that's right and the and this president now he's got a voice [Music] and he's got guts amen and he seems to be fearless there goes our election he seems to be fearless amen amen the little brother
