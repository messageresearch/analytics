[0:00] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[0:01] Christ with much Thanksgiving amen amen
[0:04] I greet you all in the name of our Lord
[0:05] and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's good
[0:08] to be found in the house of the Lord to
[0:09] worship Him amen especially in a time
[0:12] and season like this amen we ought to be
[0:15] gathered together with Believers of
[0:16] light precious Faith amen we can find no
[0:19] common ground with anyone else yes but C
[0:23] genene must connect with C gen amen life
[0:25] must connect with life amen and the body
[0:28] is fly framed together Hallelujah so
[0:31] everybody feeling good amen hallelujah
[0:35] we know we are the sons and daughters of
[0:36] the most high God and we have Zoe life
[0:39] within us amen then we oughtn't be down
[0:42] and gloomy one day and up another day
[0:45] amen but we should be full of the glory
[0:47] of God Amen let's turn to St John
[0:49] chapter 5 amen praise the
[0:52] Lord
[0:55] hallelujah we find that the Lord will
[0:57] keep certain things for certain seasons
[1:00] and if you remember brother Brandon when
[1:02] he's preaching that seventh seal he says
[1:04] as light is needed it will be given amen
[1:07] and we can start to see that coming out
[1:10] now amen as light is needed it is coming
[1:13] to the body amen as she needs that
[1:16] perfect Faith it's coming to the body
[1:19] amen so we just want to follow the
[1:21] leading of the Holy Spirit we don't want
[1:23] to be disconnected from the Holy Spirit
[1:26] when he says move we move amen when he
[1:29] says keep quiet we keep quiet amen
[1:31] hallelujah so St John 5 and verse 19
[1:38] amen praise the
[1:40] Lord you see here the scripture reads
[1:43] then answered Jesus and said unto them
[1:46] verily verily I say unto you the son can
[1:50] do nothing of
[1:52] himself but what he seeth the father do
[1:56] amen for what things soever he doth
[2:00] these also doeth the son
[2:02] likewise amen so we see Jesus had the
[2:05] mind of the father and he's telling us
[2:07] the son can do nothing of himself but
[2:10] what he seeth the father do for what
[2:13] things soever he doeth that also doeth
[2:16] the son likewise so he was depending on
[2:20] the father leading him he was depending
[2:22] on leadership amen the Lord had
[2:24] blessings to the reading of his word you
[2:26] may be seated amen praise the Lord amen
[2:30] he's certainly worthy to be praised amen
[2:34] he's worthy to be adored amen i' like
[2:36] take a little thought a title called the
[2:39] harmony the Aron this harmony is now to
[2:43] exist between the groom and the
[2:47] bride amen what we reading here St John
[2:51] 5:19 then we see it's it's not just a
[2:54] statement Jesus made but he is basically
[2:57] showing you in type how the groom
[3:01] operated the bride will operate amen
[3:04] amen hallelujah so we know that we were
[3:07] locked up as he thought in
[3:10] Elohim
[3:12] amen and as long as Elohim kept it
[3:14] locked in his mind we could never come
[3:17] to
[3:18] expression amen but we were expressed
[3:21] how through the logos what is the logos
[3:24] the word we know the word was made flesh
[3:27] so we were locked up in the logos
[3:30] amen and we find that the lordos kept it
[3:33] a hidden Mystery but it was revealed in
[3:36] Ty through Adam and
[3:37] Eve amen but here at the end time now
[3:41] when Christ is on the cross he unveils
[3:43] the plan when he stri when they strike
[3:45] his side and out comes the body of the
[3:48] Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the lord
[3:50] it's in the Sunday fold of brother
[3:52] Joshua amen I just copied it and paste
[3:54] it there in the Sunday folder I've got a
[3:55] little flyer there just the inspiration
[3:57] for next week service meetings I want to
[3:59] put it up and announce the service amen
[4:01] just lead trusting the Lord for the
[4:03] details of the service amen so next week
[4:05] Wednesday we will have a service amen
[4:07] our normal service but it'll be under
[4:09] special inspiration have you got the
[4:11] picture brother
[4:13] Joshua
[4:19] hallelujah amen amen so that'll be our
[4:22] inspiration for next week wedness day
[4:26] amen we all know what happened on the
[4:27] 28th of February 1963 amen amen so it's
[4:31] called The Cloud of Glory amen
[4:33] hallelujah and Revelation 101 the
[4:36] prophet says if the vision is scriptural
[4:38] it must be interpreted by a scriptural
[4:41] by the scripture so being a scriptural
[4:43] prophet he went to the scripture and the
[4:45] Lord took him to Revelation 10 to
[4:47] interpret the vision amen hallelujah
[4:52] amen and a vision will not fail yes
[4:55] write the vision amen though it car wait
[4:58] for it yes it shall come to pass amen
[5:02] amen so he saw this Vision 6 months
[5:04] anyway we're going into next week's
[5:06] service we need to keep quiet and and
[5:08] wait for next week's service but that's
[5:10] the inspiration I want you to pray for
[5:11] the service amen because the Lord will
[5:13] do Mighty things amen so it's a
[5:16] commemoration of that day you know that
[5:18] it remains a mystery secret to the world
[5:21] but to us it's not a secret so therefore
[5:23] we can celebrate it amen The Cloud of
[5:26] Glory when his glory came down am amen
[5:30] amen a mystery to the world but to us
[5:33] the coming glory amen praise the Lord
[5:36] amen so here the prophet would say amen
[5:38] after reading that scripture we go to a
[5:40] quote here in the church AG book so he's
[5:42] talking about the harmony between the
[5:44] Father and Jesus now it picks it up in
[5:46] the church AG book and this is coming
[5:48] from a letter to the church pick up your
[5:51] pen and
[5:52] write Holy Spirit inspires the prophet
[5:55] tells him pick up your pen and write and
[5:58] in the secret letter to the bride he is
[6:00] writing the
[6:01] statement he says notice the armony of
[6:05] the father and the
[6:07] son Jesus never did anything until it
[6:10] was first showed him by the Father John
[6:14] 5:19
[6:16] amen then he says this harmony is now to
[6:20] exist between the groom and his
[6:23] [Music]
[6:25] bride that means we can't think our own
[6:27] thoughts we can't do what we want in
[6:29] this life amen we are not Latos
[6:33] gogs amen but we here to do the will of
[6:35] the father amen we are on assignment
[6:39] amen we are on commission amen how much
[6:41] more so under Revelation 10 under
[6:43] commission thou must prophesy again amen
[6:46] so the armony is now to exist between
[6:50] the groom and his bride by God's grace
[6:53] amen are you a part of the Bride this
[6:54] evening amen we are fly framed then the
[6:57] armony must now exist between the bride
[7:00] and the groom now what will the armony
[7:02] look like they will be in one Accord
[7:05] because any marriage way to work for
[7:07] that Union to work they must be in
[7:10] harmony they must be synchronized that's
[7:12] what the word harmony means to be in one
[7:14] Accord to be synchronized to be in
[7:17] agreement because how can two walk
[7:19] together L they be agreed amen imagine
[7:22] if we are walking according to the
[7:23] dictat of our own Arts here in this late
[7:25] end of this latest year Church age but
[7:27] Christ wants to fully manifest himself
[7:29] through his
[7:30] bride that would be a scene like Queen
[7:34] uh queen vasti and king
[7:36] acerus wanting to show the glory through
[7:39] the bride but she's not interested
[7:41] pursuing her own plans her own agenda
[7:45] amen church is just a thing that we do
[7:47] once a week or twice a week it's not a
[7:50] lifestyle that's what that vasy is amen
[7:53] but the body and the Bride of the Lord
[7:54] Jesus Christ every day amen she's in
[7:57] harmony with the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:59] Christ amen she knows that it's not her
[8:01] doing the works but it is him through
[8:05] her so yes what the amony will look like
[8:08] the quote continues he shows her his
[8:11] Word of
[8:12] Life she receives it she never doubts it
[8:16] oh yes that's what Armon looks like amen
[8:19] she never doubts it amen hallelujah now
[8:22] when we are reading this I want you to
[8:24] contrast this with Omega Eve she was
[8:27] shown the word of life
[8:29] initially she received it but then she
[8:32] doubted it but
[8:34] this amen this uh sorry that's the alpab
[8:37] bride this Omega bride she receives the
[8:39] word of life and she never doubts
[8:42] it the prophet goes on to say the
[8:45] members now this ought to Rejoice of our
[8:48] hearts because we are the members of the
[8:50] Virgin
[8:51] bride amen we are the members of the
[8:53] Virgin bride he says the members of the
[8:55] Virgin bride will love
[8:57] him they will have his
[9:00] potentials amen have you read in the
[9:03] Bible Jesus potentials he is saying the
[9:06] bride will have his potentials amen
[9:08] that's his abilities his capabilities
[9:11] his promises for what he is their head
[9:14] and all power belongs to him amen they
[9:18] are subject to him now that's the
[9:20] Ephesians 5 subjection why been
[9:24] subjection they are subject to him as
[9:26] members of our bodies are subject to our
[9:28] head
[9:29] now here he goes on to say therefore you
[9:32] see when we in armony with the with
[9:34] Jesus he says nothing can
[9:37] armor nothing can harm you in this hour
[9:40] amen hallelujah even though 200 million
[9:42] demons are let loose upon the Earth H is
[9:44] following that fourth Rider nothing
[9:47] shall harm you amen thank you Lord amen
[9:51] hallelujah not even death so don't be
[9:54] afraid of death death can't harm you
[9:56] death will change your Dwelling Place
[9:58] death will move move you into your
[10:00] theophonic body amen
[10:03] hallelujah we know what is Promised for
[10:05] us amen because there was a man here who
[10:08] could turn on the light amen he took the
[10:10] light amen he took the darkness of death
[10:13] and he Shone light upon death he took
[10:15] the light amen he took the darkness of
[10:18] what happens after
[10:21] death he went beyond the curtain of time
[10:24] and he Shone light yes amen come on now
[10:27] I want you to think from your Spirit man
[10:29] The Original Seed man the gene man I'm
[10:32] preaching to this evening amen he took
[10:34] light he took light and he Shone it upon
[10:36] your dimensional bodies amen that you
[10:38] can be here in a threedimensional world
[10:41] but he Shone light in the
[10:42] six-dimensional world and he shows you
[10:44] that there's another dimension of your
[10:46] body laying there in that Dimension so
[10:49] you're a dimensional being amen
[10:51] hallelujah and one of these days God is
[10:53] going to connect those two bodies those
[10:55] two Dimensions to make it a glorified
[10:58] body amen can somebody give God praise
[11:00] amen
[11:02] hallelujah amen nothing can armor not
[11:05] even death he says here is the secret of
[11:08] it the word is in the bride amen don't
[11:11] let Satan tell you you're good for
[11:12] nothing that you don't have the word if
[11:14] you are the Bride of Jesus Christ the
[11:16] word is in the bride as it was in Mary
[11:20] Amen Hallelujah Lord amen praise the
[11:23] Lord the bride has the mind of Christ
[11:25] for she knows what he wants done with
[11:27] the word amen so Mary Mary could have
[11:30] been the Mechanics for many years yes
[11:33] she was the Mechanics for many years
[11:36] amen but one day she had to make that
[11:38] word live amen amen she was reading
[11:41] Isaiah 9 for many years a virgin shall
[11:45] conceive she was part of the Dynamics
[11:48] amen quoting the word quoting the word
[11:50] quoting the word but in the right season
[11:52] Amen in the season of manifestation when
[11:55] that promise has to come to pass amen
[11:57] that Dynamics has to to strike the
[11:59] mechanics yes amen amen and the Dynamics
[12:03] came to the mechanics I hope you can see
[12:06] it there amen hallelujah the angel of
[12:09] God the Holy Spirit came in the form of
[12:11] Gabriel and said Mary thou are favored
[12:14] highly favorite amongst all women
[12:16] hallelujah amen oh some of you may be
[12:19] getting shocked amen I'm telling you the
[12:21] angel of the holy spirit in the form of
[12:23] the angel of God came to the mechanics
[12:25] amen the Dynamics came to the mechanics
[12:28] to Quicken the word that was in
[12:31] maryah and she said be unto me according
[12:34] to Thy word what did she do she began to
[12:36] give fuel for the Dynamics to be able to
[12:38] work you remember the prophet says you
[12:40] need that fuel he says if there's no gas
[12:43] in there there's no good by Mary's
[12:45] acceptance to the Angel's message she
[12:47] began to fuel and cause a spark to
[12:50] germinate so that the Holy Ghost could
[12:52] overshadow Mary and bring the Word of
[12:54] Life to pass somebody give God praise
[12:57] amen thank you
[12:59] amen amen amen what is the mind of
[13:01] Christ you ask we got to cross to
[13:03] another message very quickly and the
[13:05] world is again falling apart the prophet
[13:07] says if the mind of Christ is in us then
[13:10] we will recognize that word to be the
[13:12] truth amen and it lives right through US
[13:16] amen denominations do not accept this
[13:18] message there's only one group of people
[13:21] that allows this message this word that
[13:24] recognizes this word he says if you
[13:26] recognize this word that's the mind of
[13:29] coming to the
[13:30] church amen thank you Lord thank you
[13:34] Lord amen can it be more pler than that

[13:41] the truth let me tell you something
[13:43] little iglet you didn't recognize the
[13:45] truth you didn't recognize William

[13:48] of association with your father of
[13:51] association with your mother of
[13:53] association with any Earthly man you
[13:55] recognized Malachi 4 message to be the
[13:57] truth because you had representation on
[13:59] the inside of you you are always an
[14:01] eagle amen you are always a gene of God

[14:34] life itself we have dimensions of our
[14:36] bodies amen hallelujah first we come in

[14:47] of Adam are Fallen amen hallelujah sons
[14:50] of Adam cannot redeem themselves

[14:57] must be born again yes hallelujah amen
[15:01] amen Jesus said you must be born again

[15:32] measure amen one like the world has
[15:34] never seen yes we are a continuation of
[15:37] the book of Acts but only if you know

[18:56] through the bride amen
[18:59] yes amen they
[19:02] know okay she knows that for it was not
[19:05] your time for him to do certain things
[19:08] that he must do now you see even when
[19:10] brother Brandon was opening that seven
[19:12] seal he knew it wasn't yet
[19:15] time so he says I mustn't say anything
[19:19] more and he says as light is needed it

[19:24] light is going to come to the church and
[19:26] the body who is it going to come by amen

[19:32] Holy Spirit right but the holy spirit is
[19:36] walking through Ephesians 4 that's right
[19:38] amen you can get no light in this time
[19:42] in this season except it come via the
[19:44] fivefold ministry
[19:46] right now you see the attack on the
[19:49] fivefold ministry now you see the attack
[19:51] on silencing that five-fold Ministry
[19:54] because it knows it is time now that
[19:56] light is needed so they're trying to
[19:58] shut up the fivefold ministry how many
[20:00] of you have seen the revelation of
[20:02] William Brandon's message grow greater
[20:04] because of the fivefold ministry
[20:06] amen am I've seen it amen I'm a
[20:11] recipient of the fold ministry glory to
[20:14] his name amen amen amen praise the Lord
[20:18] amen so not yet time for him to do
[20:21] certain things so God works according to
[20:22] times and Seasons but he will now
[20:24] fulfill through the bride that work
[20:27] which he left for this specific time yes
[20:31] so beyond
[20:32] expectation because when he calls me I
[20:36] will answer when he calls me I will
[20:40] answer yes he calls you Amen to operate
[20:44] same amen Mark 16 he calls you Amen to
[20:47] lay hands upon the sick he calls you to
[20:49] anoint them that are sick amen with oil
[20:52] he calls you to speak the word amen in
[20:54] your time of
[20:57] need
[20:59] thank
[21:02] you here in this message the prophet is
[21:04] saying now he's taking types and
[21:07] shadows if we can see what Jesus was in
[21:09] the New Testament we'll see what Jesus
[21:12] is working amongst us in the last
[21:14] days we're looking for the armony right
[21:16] that's what we focused on so we're
[21:19] looking at the type to see how he
[21:21] operate then he will work the same
[21:22] because he's Hebrews 138 yes now here's
[21:26] a very important one
[21:28] not all together work Jesus working in
[21:31] me William brandom you hear what the
[21:33] prophet is
[21:34] saying what are what are what are some
[21:37] people
[21:38] saying that he's only working through
[21:40] him right remember now they trying to
[21:42] silence the voice of the fivefold and
[21:44] they saying he's only working through
[21:46] them here what the prophet is saying not
[21:48] allog together Jesus working in me he
[21:51] works in you just the same as he works
[21:53] in me
[21:55] amen anybody that's born again I I may
[21:58] be able to see visions and you may not
[22:01] but that doesn't mean that he's not with
[22:03] you he's with you just the same amen
[22:06] watch now he talks about the prophet and
[22:08] the King
[22:09] here he was just the same with zekiah as
[22:12] he was with
[22:14] Isaiah but Isaiah ezekiah was the one
[22:17] who got the blessing not
[22:21] Isaiah asaiah just took the word it
[22:24] wasn't Isaiah's praise that was heard it
[22:27] was ezekiah highest praise that was
[22:31] heard so you see when the five Ministry
[22:33] is preaching sometimes it seems like the
[22:36] people are more blessed because one is
[22:38] just bringing the word but the one
[22:40] that's catching the word amen he's able
[22:41] to operate the
[22:44] word
[22:46] than amen praise the Lord so yeah he's
[22:49] saying when when he passed by the pool
[22:51] talking about saying John 5 then now he
[22:53] seen all the people he healed a man and
[22:55] the Jews questioned him I can't do
[22:57] nothing whatever the father does he
[22:59] shows me and then I go do that that's
[23:01] true in St John 5:19 and we notice in
[23:04] Jesus he was a kind man he was a humble
[23:07] man yet he was a man of power when he
[23:11] spoke he was very humble and gentle but
[23:14] when it come time to separate between
[23:16] truth and error Jesus was very
[23:19] Stern picked up some ropes and tied them
[23:22] together and kicked over the money
[23:23] charges table and beat them out of the
[23:26] temple called the Pharisees those
[23:29] religious people while you bunch of
[23:30] Hypocrites you serpents Snakes in the
[23:33] Grass and all these things he was a man
[23:36] who could speak when it come time to
[23:38] speak he was a man who was full of love
[23:41] but he loved his father so much till he
[23:44] stayed in harmony with his father and
[23:47] anything that interfered with that
[23:49] Harmony then Jesus draw the line amen
[23:52] amen anything that comes to interrupt
[23:55] our Harmony between us and Jesus we
[23:57] draug line we don't compromise with the
[24:00] word amen we treasure the harmony
[24:03] between groom and bride praise the
[24:07] lord well that would be the same man
[24:10] today he's here he will let you do
[24:13] things and so forth like that but when
[24:15] you go to
[24:16] sinning and go like that then however
[24:19] the line will be drawn you see so Jesus
[24:22] is going to preserve the armony as
[24:24] well Jesus is going to bring his wife
[24:26] under subjection
[24:29] if she goes out of
[24:30] line that's what he's trying to tell you
[24:33] now listen something will come down and
[24:35] then stop it and say look here just a
[24:38] minute is that right sure he does he
[24:40] chastens his children chastens them I
[24:42] believe he does and the Bible says they
[24:44] are brought upon us to try our faith
[24:48] amen now if you're sick tonight and
[24:51] something might have happened along the
[24:52] road and you sinned or something another
[24:54] ask God to forgive you amen Maybe you've
[24:57] been a little Dil Tre and you say well I
[25:01] never went out and got drunk you see
[25:03] people perceive sin to be a certain
[25:04] thing you don't have to get drunk to sin
[25:07] just
[25:08] disbelief that's sin
[25:10] [Music]
[25:13] unbelief amen praise the
[25:16] Lord now the prophet is going to speak
[25:18] in plain language these are his words
[25:21] he's saying in very PL plain language
[25:25] the true bride of Christ was in the mind
[25:27] of God etern
[25:28] though not expressed until each came
[25:30] forth in the designated decreed
[25:35] season you know what a special thought
[25:37] we must have been
[25:39] then if he kept us for the
[25:41] End Amen you know the only keep us bold
[25:44] for the
[25:47] end they keep the best for the
[25:50] End Amen yes hallelujah
[25:54] amen and though she is feminine okay and
[25:58] as each member came forth it became
[26:00] expressed and took its place in the body
[26:03] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[26:05] word seed
[26:07] bride literal spoken word seed bride you
[26:11] know what he's saying he spoke you to
[26:14] come in this time and
[26:19] season how if you carting catching the
[26:21] heart of this amen what does it mean to
[26:24] be the spoken word seed bride oh yes
[26:26] Lord God spoke you to come in this time
[26:28] and season amen like he spoke and said
[26:30] let there be he spoke you to come in
[26:34] this time and
[26:37] season and though she is feminine in
[26:39] designation she's also called the body
[26:42] of Christ it is very apparent that she
[26:44] ought to be called that for she was
[26:46] predestinated in him came from the same
[26:49] Source that's what we were dealing with
[26:51] on
[26:52] Sunday came from the same Source came
[26:55] from the same material amen
[26:59] was eternal with him oh Hallelujah
[27:03] that's why you can't end me because I'm
[27:06] Eternal with him I come from the same
[27:08] Source I share the same DNA amen amen
[27:12] hallelujah yes I have God particles in
[27:15] me oh thank you
[27:17] Lord thank you
[27:19] Lord and He now manifesting God in a
[27:22] many membered body whereas once God was
[27:25] manifested in one member even our Lord
[27:27] Jesus
[27:29] Christ now then here we are coming to a
[27:33] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[27:36] manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt
[27:39] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[27:41] and that Eternal one was the father
[27:43] manifest In the Flesh thereby gained the
[27:45] title of son even so we Eternal in his
[27:49] thoughts in our turn became the many
[27:52] member spoken word seed amen manifest in
[27:56] flesh and those Eternal thoughts now
[27:59] manifest in flesh are the sons of God
[28:02] even as we are so called
[28:05] amen so what are
[28:07] we amen I if you want strong meat
[28:15] than we are the Holy Ghost
[28:19] manifest amen
[28:22] okay amen somebody the bone
[28:26] there the holy ghost is a
[28:28] spirit oh yes so God was if we read that
[28:31] you just studyed this quote when you go
[28:33] home yes he's showing you how God came
[28:35] from Spirit to word to flesh but he
[28:38] needed a body in order to express
[28:39] himself through flesh so the Holy Spirit
[28:42] which is a part of the Trinity if you
[28:44] know what I mean those three are one the
[28:48] holy spirit in this time and season in
[28:50] order for him to be fully expressed he
[28:52] needs bodies yes amen so when I'm
[28:56] looking at you Holy Ghost people I'm
[28:58] looking at manifested Holy
[29:02] Ghost this revelation will get stronger
[29:05] amen if if you can get the true
[29:06] revelation of who she is

[29:12] expressed in Jesus made him what amen

[29:18] Jesus made him

[30:15] reborn for only the elect can be
[30:19] reborn yes are you hearing what the
[30:21] prophet is saying only a certain class
[30:24] of people can be reborn in this hour you
[30:27] have to be Original
[30:30] Seed we did not become seed because we
[30:32] were born again we were born again
[30:35] because we were Original Seed yes amen
[30:39] because we were seed is the reason we
[30:41] can could be quickened in nonseed

[31:50] sensation the Holy Ghost amen is not
[31:53] restoration of the
[31:55] gifts but the Holy Ghost is actually a
[31:57] hidden Mystery for this
[32:00] hour that when it comes upon the
[32:02] believer oh
[32:05] yes that's why he says your Tabernacle
[32:08] your Tabernacle deity right amen amen

[32:19] seeds right
[32:20] now amen hallelujah praise the Lord so
[32:25] we did not come become SE by the rebirth
[32:29] when Jesus said you must be born again
[32:31] we didn't become the seed then that's
[32:33] what he's saying we were the seed
[32:35] therefore we were reborn for only the
[32:37] elect can be
[32:39] reborn because we were seed is the
[32:41] reason we could be quickened in non
[32:44] there's nothing to Quicken thank you
[32:46] Lord thank you
[32:48] Lord he says all this carefully in mind
[32:51] now to take the next step redeem means
[32:53] to buy back it restores to the original
[32:56] owner yes God by his death the shed
[32:59] blood brought back his own he brought
[33:02] back the spoken word seed bride amen
[33:05] redeemed our love to Proclaim it amen
[33:09] yes and we were in the thoughts of God
[33:11] then expressed in flesh and there had to
[33:14] come a day when we would hear his voice
[33:17] the word and hearing that voice become
[33:19] aware of our father calling
[33:21] us and recognize that we are sons of God
[33:25] Amen we heard his voice and we cried out
[33:28] as did The Prodigal Son save me oh my
[33:30] father I am returning to thee a Son of
[33:33] God can go a long time before he
[33:35] recognizes that he is a Son of God in
[33:38] fact a lot of true Christians are like
[33:40] the story of the baby eagle that was
[33:41] etched out under a end you know that the
[33:44] eagle is a type of the True Believer
[33:47] when a farmer took an egg from the
[33:48] Eagle's Nest placed it under a end in
[33:51] due time all the eggs under the end
[33:52] etched out the baby cheeks got along fly
[33:55] with the mother end but the little eagle
[33:57] could not figure out the clacking and
[33:58] scratching for food in the manual
[34:01] pile he managed to make a living but he
[34:04] was pretty confused about it
[34:08] all so you had a 15-year-old eaglet
[34:11] sitting there in the
[34:13] denominations hey brother jaff was
[34:16] telling me he came to the
[34:18] convention Easter
[34:20] convention and he said even though he
[34:22] had responsibilities he was a Sunday
[34:23] school leader he didn't even resign from
[34:26] his position in fact he never went back
[34:27] to the chicken
[34:29] yard he just
[34:33] flew amen now what would make a
[34:36] 15-year-old do that what is he saying
[34:39] here a true Son of God can go for
[34:45] years amen but when he hears that eagle
[34:49] scream and then an eagle
[34:52] scream Child come out of her amen praise
[34:57] the
[34:59] Lord but one day way up in the air the
[35:02] mother Eagle that had laid that egg
[35:04] spyed that little Eagle on the ground
[35:06] she swooped down with tremendous speed
[35:09] and screamed at the top of her voice for
[35:11] him to fly up to
[35:13] Meer now you didn't realize that what
[35:15] was
[35:16] happening Mama Eagle came to the
[35:18] convention brother
[35:20] Joshua and told him now you are in the
[35:23] church Mama Eagle came to you in your
[35:26] time and Seas him
[35:29] amen he had never heard an eagle cry but
[35:32] when he heard that first scream
[35:34] something in him stirred and he longed
[35:35] to launch out toward
[35:38] it amen the chickens were screaming
[35:41] false prophet the chickens were
[35:43] screaming stay away from it chickens
[35:45] were screaming C amen but something
[35:48] there was a deep inside of you amen
[35:51] hallelujah thank you Lord thank you
[35:54] Jesus amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[35:57] he screamed back amen hallelujah you got
[36:00] to call back out to Mama amen he
[36:02] screamed back that he was afraid once
[36:04] more she called out screaming that he
[36:06] Tred beating his wings he h himself into
[36:09] the air and answering the Cry of the
[36:11] mother he sort off into the blue skies
[36:14] oh yes you see he was always an eagle he
[36:16] acted like a chicken for a while but he
[36:18] could not be satisfied but when he heard
[36:21] that call of that great Eagle he came to
[36:23] his own
[36:24] place and once he Son of God hears the
[36:27] Cry of the Spirit by the word he too
[36:30] will realize who he is and run to the
[36:32] great prophet Eagle you see who he's
[36:34] typing that word the great prophet eagle
[36:36] and be with him forever seated in
[36:38] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen

[37:03] know how to operate the word amen amen
[37:07] am you will know how to operate the word
[37:10] why you haven't left the
[37:13] guide amen you are relying on the guide
[37:16] to teach you how to operate the word
[37:19] amen if do not know how to operate the
[37:21] word because she got away from her guide
[37:24] she got away from her teacher she got
[37:26] away from her Spirit of truth because
[37:28] the spirit of Truth was not
[37:30] around Adam was her guide Adam was a
[37:34] leader Adam was her spirit of truth but
[37:36] she got away from the original spirit
[37:38] amen she got away from the guide and she
[37:41] began to go out on her own grounds amen
[37:43] steep onto the grounds of unbelief she
[37:45] stepped onto the grounds of reasoning
[37:47] amen hallelujah without the guide and
[37:50] when she went on to reasoning she
[37:52] thought she could handle the word
[37:53] without the guide amen without the
[37:55] spirit of Truth
[37:57] yes but this eve this Omega Eve is not
[38:00] like Alpha Eve she stays with the guide
[38:04] amen
[38:05] hallelujah praise the
[38:07] Lord
[38:11] amen in the
[38:13] message God of this evil age you're
[38:16] going to have to type this up brother
[38:18] Joshua the God of this evil age
[38:20] paragraph
[38:22] 37
[38:25] amen so Eve I'm talking to you I'm
[38:29] talking to you because right now you are
[38:31] the most powerful being on the face of
[38:32] the
[38:33] [Music]
[38:34] Earth you are a supernatural being
[38:38] empowered by the Holy Ghost quickened by
[38:41] the word amen we find
[38:44] now this evil age is to prove you see
[38:47] what the evil age is to do to prove
[38:49] something to prove to Satan she is not
[38:52] like
[38:54] Eve that she is not that type of a
[38:58] woman she will be Tried by his word the
[39:01] Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the
[39:03] word and Adam's bride believed every bit
[39:05] of the word all but confused on one
[39:09] promise that is the same yesterday today
[39:11] and forever today but failed on One
[39:14] Promise under the temptation of the
[39:16] enemy face to face and now the people
[39:19] that's called for his name of course is
[39:22] his bride she's come in contact Again by
[39:24] the same thing not by just
[39:26] denominational truth or something but
[39:28] every word for in the beginning of the
[39:31] Bible man was given the word of God to
[39:33] live by one word misinterpreted a man
[39:37] called Satan in the person of an animal
[39:40] called The Serpent Satan in this person
[39:43] could talk to
[39:44] Eve you see what I'm trying to tell you
[39:46] Spirits possess
[39:49] bodies so if the Holy Ghost Is
[39:51] possessing a brother and the brother is
[39:53] speaking to you the word of God who is
[39:55] really speaking to you
[39:57] amen
[39:59] amen
[40:01] amen Satan in this person could talk to
[40:04] Eve and misinterpreted the word to her
[40:07] and was lost it must be every word in
[40:10] the middle of the Bible Jesus came and
[40:12] said man shall not live by bread alone
[40:13] but by every word where he was tempted
[40:16] by Satan God telling us here in the last
[40:19] days the God of this world will rise up
[40:20] in the last days and whosoever shall add
[40:23] one word to it or take one word from it
[40:25] his part will be taken from from The
[40:26] Book of Life I'm trying to show you the
[40:28] characteristic of this bride that she
[40:30] will be in harmony with the groom and
[40:32] she will not forsake one word One Dot
[40:35] one comma one
[40:37] aot
[40:39] [Music]
[40:41] amen Now Eve was United until she broke
[40:44] one
[40:45] word okay I think this is another
[40:48] message in the message
[40:49] Oneness Amen in the message Oneness
[40:53] paragraph
[40:54] 32 amen praise the Lord just give me 5
[40:58] minutes we'll be done amen praise the
[41:05] Lord
[41:07] amen Now Eve was United until she broke
[41:10] one word remember our our thought the
[41:14] harmony that exist between the bride and
[41:16] the groom the harmony comes down to us
[41:19] keeping the word right
[41:21] now he was United until she broke one
[41:24] word or doubted one word being true that
[41:27] separated her every word man shall not
[41:30] live by bread alone but every word so we
[41:32] can be in God United because Adam and
[41:35] Eve before the fall before the
[41:38] disbelieving of the word was an example
[41:40] of what we could be in
[41:42] him so they held the mystery between
[41:44] Christ and the
[41:46] bride to be United with with him is life
[41:49] to be separated from him is death right
[41:53] now 33 he says we know we make mistakes
[41:58] but you mustn't look at
[42:00] that it's not your mistakes because
[42:03] you're always going to have
[42:08] them but you see it's following his
[42:11] rules following what he said do
[42:13] stumbling and falling doesn't have one
[42:15] thing to do with it come on now brother
[42:19] stumble and falling doesn't have one
[42:21] thing to do with it a real true servant
[42:25] if he stumbled he'll get up again amen
[42:29] if he wobbles God pulls him right back
[42:31] into the path as long as he's in the
[42:33] part of Duty but if he's off the part of
[42:36] Duty God's not obligated to him but as
[42:39] long as he's in the part of Duty God's
[42:41] obligated to him knowing that he's just
[42:43] a man or a
[42:45] woman is obligated to that person as
[42:48] long as they in the part of
[42:51] Duty amen praise the
[42:54] Lord so so God is under obligation to
[42:58] you to not look at your human
[43:03] failures amen so how can we use excuses
[43:07] like I'm not
[43:10] perfect amen that I'm always making
[43:12] mistakes Lord is there something wrong
[43:14] with me you're looking at your human
[43:16] mistakes you you're living in a body
[43:18] that's not yet fully redeemed yes amen
[43:21] praise the Lord amen amen so the Omega
