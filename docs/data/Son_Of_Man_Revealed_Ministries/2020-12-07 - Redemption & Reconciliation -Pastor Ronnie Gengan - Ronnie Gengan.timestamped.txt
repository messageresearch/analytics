[15:30] come
[15:32] the wood for the burnt offering and rose
[15:36] up and went up to the place of which God
[15:39] had called him then on the third day his
[15:44] eyes and saw the place afar off and
[15:48] Abraham said to his young man abide here
[15:52] with the head and high and the lad will
[15:55] go yonder and worship and come again to
[15:59] you in and Abraham took the wood of the
[16:02] burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac
[16:04] his son and he took the fire in his hand
[16:07] and a knife and they went both of them
[16:10] together and Isaac spake unto Abraham
[16:14] his father except my father he said ya
[16:17] Am I
[16:18] my son and he said we are the fire in
[16:21] the wood but where is the lamb for the
[16:24] burnt offering and Abraham said my son
[16:27] God will provide himself
[16:29] 11 for a burnt offering so they went
[16:32] both of them together and they came to
[16:35] the place which God told him off and
[16:37] Abraham built an altar there and laid
[16:39] the wood in what s and burnt and bound
[16:43] Isaac his son and laid him on the altar
[16:46] upon the wood and Abraham stretched
[16:48] forth his hand and took the knife to
[16:51] slay his son and the angel of the Lord
[16:54] called on him out of heaven and said
[16:56] Abraham
[17:05] tell thy son that only sent from me and
[17:10] Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked
[17:12] and behold behind him a ram caught in
[17:16] the thicket with his arms and April I
[17:19] went and took the RAM and offered him
[17:21] for a burnt offering in the stead of a
[17:24] son Isaac amen
[17:25] praise the Lord
[17:28] and Abraham called the name of the place
[17:30] geometry as it is said to this day in

[19:10] morning and trust in you lord he breaks
[19:12] them right now redemption means the
[19:16] action of
[19:18] of being saved from sin there are on
[19:22] evil Redemption the action of saving or
[19:27] being saved from sin God's plan for
[19:33] redemption of this world see
[19:37] so redemption is God what a save people
[19:39] so if you want to save them they're lost
[19:43] right they separated from him right so
[19:47] he wants to bring them back to him right
[19:50] so it's a saving free sin in for payment
[19:54] or clearing a depth the depth light the
[19:59] intention so your slate becomes clear
[20:02] God redeems you and reconciliation
[20:13] to balance things some of their similar
[20:18] works to reconciliation is reuniting
[20:22] reunion property uation rectification
[20:29] settling resolving mehndi remedy the
[20:37] story restoration of harmony agreement
[20:42] compromise understanding peace to him
[20:46] and then to austerities the approachment
[20:51] avinasi squaring adjustment balancing
[20:57] that's reconciliations right now anyone
[21:01] any one of your company you'll know that
[21:04] well work very well in reconciliation
[21:07] skill incompatibility see
[21:14] the action of taking one view that so
[21:19] I'm just giving you to see that you'll
[21:21] know the meaning of it sometime also
[21:24] children and maybe someone else you know
[21:27] you speaker you speak something named
[21:29] you wonder whether they're really
[21:31] understand there's something some terms
[21:34] that we use also like not like we might
[21:36] say the Prophet went in turns around the
[21:38] world but they might think it one time
[21:41] you won't take time to round the world
[21:43] they were jumping ahead of plate and he
[21:46] went round the world eight times so
[21:50] sometime you can explain it to them
[21:52] eight times during the course of his
[21:55] ministry right you went so in a country
[22:00] reconciliation is a process
[22:02] reconciliation we use to ensure that the
[22:06] money living in account matches the
[22:09] actual money spent this is done by
[22:12] making sure that then but so if somebody
[22:17] is cooking the books or something and
[22:19] when they become solid they can see
[22:21] seven bunnies now they said went for
[22:23] certain place and didn't happen at all
[22:25] but if they've got all the receipts and
[22:27] it was done and God was in Christ they
[22:32] conceived reconciling the world to
[22:34] himself see God was in Christ that's
[22:39] what the Bible said God was in Christ
[22:41] reconciling the world to himself praise
[22:46] the Lord Amen right and then yeah we
[22:52] find that Redemption only came through
[22:55] Jesus Christ to redeem to bring back to
[22:59] its original position right so that's
[23:02] why God uses that idea of Abraham that
[23:05] Abraham went to learn what remember can
[23:09] offer your son for a sacrifice and God
[23:12] showed him that there was a lamb there
[23:14] and the lamb is
[23:17] Genesis Exodus and show that sorry
[23:23] reconciliation and leave them I say man
[23:28] and examine the LEM for four days there
[23:34] to make sure there was no blemish
[23:35] because a perfect length so that is
[23:39] trapping Christ amen and after examine
[23:42] the lamb and make sure there was nothing
[23:44] wrong with it
[23:48] and the glades less lieutenant pilots
[23:50] home and their private cells are find no
[23:53] fault in him he examined me me
[23:57] questioning me in a hole man and a fee
[23:59] and the way Jesus stood by him he said I
[24:02] find no fault in it in that race god
[24:04] that is confirming there is no fault in
[24:06] Jesus a man he endeavoured to get you to
[24:09] say that
[24:12] sacrificing the perfect leg amen and all
[24:16] Redemption and reconciliation he's gonna
[24:19] come
[24:26] you know
[24:31] I'm sure worthy amen amen
[24:37] want me to take the book amen because
[24:41] the Bible says there's nobody worthy
[24:42] amen
[24:43] they look for somebody to come forth see
[24:46] and nobody kid and comfort the way there
[24:49] were prophets going through ages and
[24:51] know that some of those prophets really
[24:54] live good lives yes that's true they
[24:57] were not worthy Jesus worthy because you
[25:01] never come the way he and he was sinless
[25:05] and that's a blood oath required a
[25:09] perfect blood God's own blood
[25:12] praise the Lord so we find that the time
[25:16] here was God showing that he was going
[25:21] to be the sacrifice
[25:22] [Music]
[25:26] now God and to send the son why did he
[25:31] send me son why do you becoming tough
[25:33] that God is a spirit that's up to God
[25:36] for man he couldn't come in guidance
[25:38] that's why you have to take on the form
[25:40] of a man God was in Christ amen
[25:44] right so it was not gone now you know
[25:47] sending his son to go to pay the price
[25:49] and and things like that that'll be a
[25:51] very cruel thing if her father is in a
[25:54] problem and he you know he's gonna go to
[25:57] face something you'll be a cool thing
[25:59] for him percent he said you can fix the
[26:01] problem amen keep I said no listen yeah
[26:06] I'm going to fix the problem so God had
[26:09] to face the problem but it came in he
[26:11] sent a man to do the work of redemption
[26:15] they meant to do the work of
[26:17] reconciliation why he had to bring back
[26:21] because of what happened in the Garden
[26:23] of Eden
[26:23] oh man now they Garden of Eden they
[26:26] separated themselves from God disobey by
[26:32] the influencing of Satan they didn't
[26:38] want to do it Adam and Eve he didn't
[26:41] want to do it the Bible said the serpent
[26:44] beguiled them and then he took the Word
[26:49] of God and he he put one word God said
[26:51] you would surely die by one we are all
[26:55] tired
[26:56] Adam and through Jesus Christ we all
[27:00] live praise a lot so we had a first Adam
[27:03] we had the second Adam Jesus
[27:07] Jesus Christ amen the blood and the
[27:11] blood amen
[27:12] right so God planned it like that and
[27:15] that's why he had to come and people had
[27:19] to be there to press play the role of
[27:21] killing him of passing all the judgments
[27:25] and everything the Bible says will come
[27:26] upon him say that God had to have
[27:28] certain people playing the role over
[27:30] there you're dead okay
[27:35] there's many many sounds talking about
[27:38] Jesus
[27:40] gonna give you is like hey
[27:46] before it happened thanks a lot
[27:49] so burglars allow me to only speak so
[27:52] remove enough there's reconciliation the
[27:54] only way we can ever come back to God is
[27:57] through the blood of Jesus
[28:01] voila
[28:03] you
[28:06] Anibal hmm yell out that he went when he
[28:13] said he said Jesus the Bible says by one
[28:17] sacrifice once and for all
[28:19] amen amen you don't have to bring any
[28:21] more sacrifices Jesus became our
[28:24] sacrifice ladies alone how we can say
[28:28] Lord we thank you Lord we have the
[28:30] perfect sacrifice amen and we find out
[28:32] that that other sacrifice they have to
[28:34] bring the sacrifice every year that the
[28:39] book of Hebrews chapter 10 tell us that
[28:41] you bring the sacrifice every year make
[28:44] the sacrifice and when they went away
[28:46] they stood it wrong it's still sin right
[28:49] and the fell from grace and every year
[28:52] that to bring the sacrifice but the
[28:55] Bible says for sacrifice so God will not
[28:59] accept any other sacrifice except the
[29:02] blood of the Lamb his son Jesus Christ
[29:05] amen see so that is provided way and
[29:11] many won't accept any sacrifice see if
[29:14] you want to get back to God you gotta
[29:16] look
[29:21] [Music]
[29:25] the model that is preaching they said
[29:28] never a man spake like this man a man
[29:30] and the way conducted himself he never
[29:33] did anything wrong
[29:35] amen how do we know the Prophet tells us
[29:38] yet all the reason to live the way
[29:41] another man looked and dip the wet
[29:44] things that normal men did no but it
[29:47] made the sacrifice see you walk that
[29:51] perfect life he looked at life brings a
[29:56] lot
[29:56] so what's already when he happened to
[29:58] cross there and he died the Bible said
[30:00] there was an earthquake
[30:01] amen amen middle of the day everything
[30:05] went dark
[30:05] amen the rock started growing of the
[30:08] mountains amen
[30:11] the Sun refused to shine
[30:13] [Music]
[30:22] man a man who can receive our Redemption
[30:27] really concerned back to God amen amen
[30:30] see he has done the atonement praise the
[30:36] Lord praise the price for sins by the
[30:39] blood so it frankly and the message God
[30:43] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[30:45] himself
[30:47] okay says here for the love of God
[30:50] constraining us because we thus judge
[30:54] that he won that for home then we all
[30:58] die and then he died for all
[31:05] don't loop on yourself we live for him
[31:09] praise the Lord the Bible tells us we
[31:12] live and we move him amen praise the
[31:15] Lord right wherefore henceforth know we
[31:18] no man after the flesh yea though we
[31:21] have known Christ after the flesh yet
[31:24] man in slop knowing him no more
[31:26] therefore if any man be in Christ he is
[31:30] a new creature
[31:31] amen raise a lot if any man is in Christ
[31:35] he is a new creature
[31:39] that's Christ and had given to us the
[31:42] ministry
[31:52] not imputing
[31:56] you
[32:00] I don't know if anybody or any fights
[32:05] have a teller step then they can be
[32:07] reconciled by god I wasn't giving his
[32:11] life amen and shedding his blood
[32:15] place the rock that we can be reconciled
[32:18] back to God
[32:20] please look that's what we're doing back
[32:23] to hidden amen
[32:26] Adam lost his rights he forfeited his
[32:28] right a man he was like an amateur God
[32:31] the bound tells us Adam name all the
[32:35] animals a man and and he had control in
[32:39] the Garden of Eden before the fall and
[32:41] then he was in control
[32:44] what have we desired happened but when
[32:48] they disobey God he lost all that
[32:51] everything but thank God we gonna go
[32:55] back to hidden amen back to the
[32:58] restoration power back to sons and
[33:00] daughters of God again amen so our life
[33:04] here is only for the time
[33:06] praise the Lord so we should rejoice
[33:09] coronavirus or no coronavirus not
[33:12] interested God is gone away our life in
[33:16] his hands if you want to take a bite at
[33:19] coronavirus will go up - if you want to
[33:23] take us in the car accident
[33:24] regarding the car accident if you want
[33:27] to take us in a sickness we going to
[33:29] sickness
[33:29] praise the Lord as long as we are given
[33:33] friends a lot so we can't question God
[33:36] amen and we know that happened right
[33:39] through the Bible John the Baptist while
[33:42] Jesus was there he expect Jesus to come
[33:45] please rescue that were even present
[33:49] they were getting prepared to chop his
[33:51] head off
[33:52] but Jesus never went he allows them to
[33:56] cut his head off huh
[33:59] so glad Allah John the Baptist compasses
[34:02] let me cut off and also st. Paul when he
[34:07] went to be clad in row under that great
[34:10] Roman government he finally was put into
[34:14] prison and they chopped his head off but
[34:18] these all were looking to go and be with
[34:21] Christ amen like the Old Testament
[34:25] Saints the Bible says that was used to
[34:28] live
[34:29] hey men they want you to give their life
[34:32] to Christ praise the Lord and we thank
[34:35] God that we have reconciliation and
[34:38] redemption through Jesus Christ
[34:41] the blood of Jesus Christ and the devil
[34:45] Satan knows that for 2,000 years he's
[34:47] been killing Christians for 2,000 years
[34:51] by putting them in prison a man and he's
[34:54] happening stood out in this same tell me
[34:58] whichever religion he is crucified and
[35:00] killed and put into prison because of
[35:03] the faith in Christ even right now China
[35:07] basically designed prison in Iran
[35:12] Christians are in prison in Pakistan
[35:15] Christians on prison yeah they are
[35:19] fighting and you know all the time
[35:22] amen nobody else
[35:28] we find especially in there in the faith
[35:31] of Islam and if a person converts to
[35:35] Christ yet disowned by the parents some
[35:39] of the Mikheil why only for Christianity
[35:45] thanks a lot
[35:47] that's a work of the devil thinking can
[35:51] get rid of the people of God
[35:53] no but god you're a better thing for
[35:58] them
[35:59] amen death is an open door
[36:02] there's a lot through death we enter
[36:06] into life thanks a lot so don't think
[36:09] your life is great now that's the end by
[36:12] death we enter into life amen amen
[36:16] so to a Christian it's a victorious
[36:20] thing to die
[36:21] Amen the Bible clearly tells us if you
[36:24] read the book of Hebrews chapter 11
[36:26] they refuse to die or to live amen they
[36:32] want you to die they know there's a
[36:33] better life waiting mm-hmm
[36:35] so we are here for a short period of
[36:38] time people are living just past hundred
[36:42] years now but it's still a short time
[36:45] you don't know anybody that lived on 50
[36:48] years ago huh we don't anybody a man
[36:54] that lived 150 years ago where they can
[36:58] look for that period of time in that day
[37:00] in their age and their 2-1 now God
[37:04] promised here in the last day amen
[37:07] praise love being the last thing lady to
[37:10] see us the last church age Amen Jesus
[37:17] and the gospel must be preached through
[37:19] here then we ensure how many men man
[37:22] prays alone so the gospel is growing all
[37:25] over the world
[37:27] praise the Lord you know sometimes
[37:32] Jesus was they with them in the present
[37:35] they never got the revelation of what
[37:36] was happening he was there talking to
[37:41] them every time telling them parables
[37:43] but they never really understood what
[37:47] was happening
[37:49] amen when Jesus came to their crucial

[44:48] glad for that
[44:49] amen so we are reconciled to God through
[44:52] Jesus Christ raised a lot so that that
[44:57] kind goes right back there - - you can
[44:59] find that in the book of Exodus chapter
[45:01] 12 they had to take a land and slay the
[45:04] Lamb for each household the Passover
[45:07] lamb was called apartheid because during
[45:11] the Passover he was the Lamb of God day
[45:13] amen
[45:14] that was slain right at the time
[45:21] the real name of God was there amen
[45:25] they had to take him and slay him praise
[45:28] the Lord and the Bible says while Jesus
[45:31] was there on their cross who says thank
[45:33] you a man trained by the blood of Jesus
[45:38] Christ he gave his life
[45:41] good things to come see the law was only
[45:45] for sharing all these lambs and any
[45:49] wolves and all was only over having it
[45:51] shouldn't go booth kind of bulls and
[45:54] goats kill take away sin amen so it says
[45:59] here there's nobody come Amen to do your
[46:03] will or God praise the Lord
[46:05] clearly saying sacrifice and offering
[46:09] burnt offerings and offerings of sin you
[46:12] did not desire and no pleasure in them
[46:15] amen
[46:17] which was a future not offered according
[46:19] to the law then he said behold I come to
[46:22] you to do your Will O God it takes away
[46:26] the first that he may establish the
[46:29] second Amen praise the Lord I regret but

[47:07] waiting to praise Lord I'll be glad to
[47:11] let a man redemption through the blood
[47:13] there is a lot so we don't have to
[47:16] sacrifice and you know I became a
