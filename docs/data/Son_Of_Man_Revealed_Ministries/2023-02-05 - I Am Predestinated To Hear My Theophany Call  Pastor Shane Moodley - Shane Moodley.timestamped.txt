[0:09] confined to my bed I could really moved
[0:13] I was in and out of hospital and I was
[0:17] getting worse
[0:18] it couldn't find anything wrong
[0:20] I was very depressed I was feeling very
[0:23] down
[0:25] I was around I could get up and go
[0:27] person from the morning to evening and I
[0:30] was feeling very depressed
[0:32] and the one we asked the Saints to pray
[0:35] for me was lying in bed and I could
[0:38] really be I was asking for breath and I
[0:43] thought that probably my last name
[0:45] that's how I fell
[0:47] and I just started keen and kind bored
[0:51] and I know the Saints had been praying
[0:52] for me because I suddenly it just felt
[0:55] this calm and peace over me amen and
[1:05] I like to take the scenes this morning
[1:08] for pain for me I like to thank God for
[1:11] touching and meeting me hallelujah thank
[1:14] you for taking such good care of me

[2:06] year God is going to bless us both
[2:08] spiritually and in the natural amen and
[2:11] we can see testimony is coming from amen
[2:14] from different directions some receiving
[2:16] healing amen some on the spiritual side
[2:19] some have been restored amen back to the
[2:21] faith amen and some of us have been
[2:23] blessed in the natural so I just wanted
[2:26] to testify
[2:28] um during the course of life
[2:34] you know
[2:36] the answer was completely by faith I
[2:38] didn't have any
[2:39] um indication of whether I was going to
[2:41] have clients or or whether things were
[2:45] going to be okay it was completely by
[2:46] faith that I decided to just venture out
[2:48] again
[2:49] and um
[2:54] my last amazed me about how he's been
[2:57] sending times through from different

[3:10] um the old phone that I used to work for
[3:12] some of the attorneys have been living

[3:20] consultant and to give me all of these
[3:22] big matches

[16:11] favor and you are seeing more
[16:13] testimonies in those areas and those

[16:18] think amen that God is only moving in
[16:20] that family no they are raising up amen
[16:22] amen they are thinking God at his word
[16:24] amen and they are seeing the results
[16:26] amen week in and week out amen so we
[16:29] have some amazing testimonies coming
[16:31] forth amen not only in the spiritual we
[16:35] are seeing the Holy Spirit Will awaken
[16:36] us spiritually yes we are seeing the
[16:38] Holy Spirit heal we are seeing the Holy
[16:41] Spirit come and meet physical needs
[16:43] we are seeing the Holy Spirit desire
[16:45] Hearts amen amen now share this
[16:48] testimony with you amen
[16:50] so you know brother Allison was here
[16:51] last week and uh
[16:54] he called me about after seven on Friday
[16:56] night last week Friday and he told me
[16:58] you know what I need you to come and
[17:00] pray
[17:01] uh his baby was not well and he says the
[17:04] baby's eyes are rolling back
[17:07] now you know the brother was not
[17:08] faithful in church
[17:10] hasn't been here for months
[17:12] amen so I found it all that he would
[17:14] call me because he never officially told
[17:16] me that his fellowshipping here neither
[17:18] did he make me aware that I was his
[17:20] Pastor under this ministry so I didn't
[17:22] feel he was under the covering
[17:24] amen so remember I'm trying to teach you
[17:27] something here if you don't have to
[17:28] recovering we are not obligated to you
[17:31] so think about it it's after seven on a
[17:34] Friday night I got a young family as
[17:35] well
[17:36] so I have to make a decision to stay
[17:38] with my family or whether to respond to
[17:40] the call
[17:42] but I hear the brothers plea and his
[17:43] wife you know in the background and I
[17:45] see it's urgent so I tell my wife I need
[17:48] to go
[17:50] but I know now they're telling me the
[17:52] situation that the baby's eyes is
[17:53] rolling back and maybe me driving there
[17:55] I may not get to the baby on time so I
[17:58] say and I say Lord and I start to pray
[17:59] and I say father send your angel before
[18:01] me and let him touch his baby that
[18:03] before I get that the baby will be well
[18:05] that was a simple prayer
[18:08] amen and I start I live and I go there
[18:11] so he was at his uh Auntie's house I get
[18:14] to the house and the baby is not there
[18:16] in the lounge they come and they greet
[18:18] me amen and very nice Christian family
[18:21] that his aunt and uncle were they came
[18:24] greeted me found out who I was and you
[18:26] know we're having a little conversations
[18:28] so ask them where's the baby
[18:30] and they bring the baby
[18:31] and they lay the baby on the table
[18:33] dining room table and here's the baby
[18:35] gurgling and happy and
[18:38] I don't see a sick baby
[18:41] so I asked him what happened I said the
[18:44] baby looks fine to me you'll call me to
[18:46] pray for the baby they said yes boss the
[18:48] baby just went out and the baby seems to
[18:50] be fine
[18:51] and he has an answer to pray I said Lord
[18:53] before I get the letter maybe already be
[18:56] well
[18:57] amen hallelujah
[19:01] and he shall give his angels charge over
[19:03] there Jesus said I can pour Ten Thousand
[19:06] Angels right now amen
[19:09] so how much more Sons and Daughters of
[19:11] God Amen amen and I'm telling you the
[19:13] miraculous yeah so yeah the brother
[19:15] comes to church last week Sunday you're
[19:17] all seen him here in church
[19:19] and after the preaching of the world you
[19:20] know we've been singing and such an
[19:22] anointing
[19:24] amen you spoke on Entertaining Angels
[19:28] and we know even we are speaking about
[19:29] the Holy Spirit and we go outside and
[19:31] the brother comes back after he greets
[19:33] Us in the line he comes back to greet me
[19:35] and he tells me you know the wife and
[19:37] the child is still at home and he tells
[19:39] me the baby to had a rough night
[19:42] sleeping yes brother Sunny has a weapons
[19:43] he's standing right next to me
[19:46] amen and something tells me speak to
[19:49] this brother
[19:51] and I tell you brother the reason why
[19:52] your baby is like this is because your
[19:54] wife is fearful
[19:57] and I don't know why I'm telling him
[19:59] these things yes I think she's
[20:01] projecting this thing onto the child the
[20:03] child could be a month old but the fear
[20:05] of the mother is coming upon the child
[20:06] and therefore your child is reacting in
[20:08] this way
[20:11] so the brother is kind of looking at me
[20:13] and he's after I finish with him and I
[20:15] said please tell her that she needs to
[20:17] pray every time she feels this way and
[20:18] yes brother son is standing next to me
[20:20] and I said brother sunny
[20:21] so okay I'll tell you why so he spoke to
[20:24] me back and he said you know what
[20:26] my wife is very fearful right now just
[20:29] last week she was caught in a crossfire
[20:30] and a shooting
[20:32] now who designed that to him it wasn't
[20:34] me amen who designed that all right amen
[20:38] amen amen come on people amen me
[20:42] non-human ability I wouldn't know that
[20:43] that fear amen I talked to brother sunny
[20:46] and I said brother did you just hear
[20:47] what he said
[20:53] and while I'm driving and I'm thinking
[20:55] after that the prophet says the spirit
[20:58] of ananias and Sapphire will come back
[21:00] into the church
[21:01] what was that the spirit to design the
[21:05] hearts of the people
[21:07] what did Paul do to analyze and Survivor
[21:10] or Peter
[21:12] he said remember they came and sold a
[21:14] bit of land amen and he deserved their
[21:16] heart they said this is all resolved it
[21:19] for remember it was all of their money
[21:20] to keep but because they got the church
[21:23] involved
[21:24] because you say you're under the
[21:26] covering of this church
[21:28] you cannot lie to the holy spirit amen
[21:31] so the spirit of God can design things
[21:33] amen and I ask you to be sensitive to
[21:35] the spirit of God in this time amen amen
[21:40] because he's moving in a way now to take
[21:43] us past just the teaching of the word
[21:46] he is bringing that word into
[21:48] manifestation
[21:50] how many of you know of uh people who
[21:53] study to be lawyers doctors
[21:56] and spend the whole life studying
[21:59] and they are so highly qualified they
[22:01] can't even get jobs
[22:03] so all that they learned they never put
[22:05] into practice
[22:06] they just become academics
[22:10] we don't want to be that way in the
[22:11] message amen just academics because I
[22:15] tell you you know in the revelation of
[22:17] the Seven Seals
[22:19] when it comes time when you're meeting
[22:21] the enemy on the Battleground
[22:23] what is it going to do for you you must
[22:26] have an experience amen the Holy Ghost
[22:29] can only take what is Holy Ghost given
[22:31] for to bring those things to remembrance
[22:34] all those things that you've been
[22:36] learning
[22:37] all those things you've been feeding on
[22:39] and I tell you the bride has been fed
[22:42] enough to give a Rapture in faith
[22:44] how much more do we want to be fed
[22:47] we've had enough word to give us a
[22:49] rapturing faith in this hour we the holy
[22:51] ghost that Dynamics to come and strike
[22:53] that mechanics
[22:55] amen and I tell you this is the year for
[22:57] it you heard me say it amen since last
[23:00] year I'm expecting a great outpouring
[23:02] I'm expecting you to meet the angel of
[23:04] God I'm expecting greater miracles
[23:08] you have the testimony on Wednesday
[23:10] brother Joshua testify those of you are
[23:12] not sure
[23:13] [Music]
[23:15] how displacement is going to was laying
[23:17] in a coma
[23:18] and he came before brother Joshua
[23:23] under the Joshua as soon as he learned
[23:25] he said come let's pray
[23:28] and he left it the next time he meets
[23:30] the policeman was on Monday last week
[23:33] and so happened we were having
[23:34] Fellowship during the day I know that
[23:36] Joshua was delayed because of the
[23:37] fellowship
[23:39] some of you know what I mean when you
[23:41] get into talking with somebody the time
[23:44] goes
[23:45] amen so it was one after five but the
[23:47] Joshua was telling me the reason why we
[23:49] were delayed is because if he had gone
[23:51] any earlier he would not have met his
[23:53] brother
[23:54] so the conversation was delayed and what
[23:56] were we talking about the things of God
[23:58] we were talking about how the holy
[24:00] spirit is moving and what we are
[24:02] expecting to see we were talking about
[24:04] our vision for the church and what we're
[24:06] expecting to see in a greater way for
[24:08] each and every one of us
[24:10] amen
[24:13] and so when he gets back to work he
[24:16] meets up with that policeman
[24:18] and the police mentality in the
[24:19] testimony and he says the very same day
[24:22] that you pray my daughter got up from
[24:25] that coma
[24:30] what is that teacher
[24:35] the people's healing are tied to our
[24:37] dedication yeah
[24:39] and our faith in the sower amen okay so
[24:43] how much more prayer that we need to be
[24:44] amen
[24:46] amen absolutely two weeks ago we were
[24:48] chatting over lunch
[24:51] Amen brother Joshua and I
[24:54] and we talk loud if you know us
[24:57] probably our wives will tell you they're
[24:59] always telling us why you talk so loud
[25:00] just you know lower your voice
[25:02] so we didn't even know we were
[25:04] Fellowship big
[25:06] and we're talking about the angel of God
[25:08] and we're talking about you know all the
[25:09] revelation of the world and we're
[25:10] feasting the end little do we know
[25:12] behind us was a pastor
[25:15] and he was listening to our conversation
[25:17] when we get up to leave because it stops
[25:20] brother Josh when he says you know what
[25:21] I enjoy the conversation you were having
[25:24] amen so people are listening
[25:27] amen so always be a witness something we
[25:30] could have said could have triggered
[25:32] something in their hearts amen and we
[25:34] didn't know we didn't plan to do that
[25:35] amen we always talk loud
[25:37] amen so be bold in your faith amen and I
[25:42] know all of you are testifying and
[25:43] you're always witnessing but greater
[25:46] than that living life amen amen amen I
[25:49] tell you if you do nothing else for the
[25:51] rest of this year seek the baptism of
[25:53] the Holy Ghost
[25:54] the most powerful thing you can do
[25:57] seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[26:00] know if you know what the proper of God
[26:02] says
[26:03] he says nobody can have a birth
[26:06] or nobody can be pregnant and have a
[26:08] birth without knowing about it
[26:12] so if we have to ask you have you
[26:13] received the Holy Ghost since you
[26:15] believed
[26:16] you can't wonder
[26:17] amen you must know the experience
[26:21] which woman I gave birth I didn't know
[26:24] she was giving birth
[26:27] she was screaming
[26:31] so I'm asking you evaluate Our Lives say
[26:35] Lord I've come this far I want to know
[26:38] without a shadow of a doubt I have the
[26:40] Holy Ghost that's the only token we know
[26:42] for the Rapture amen I'll give us to
[26:46] shame and we're so happy to have him
[26:47] with us this morning let's keep my hand
[26:49] a welcome
[26:50] amen
[26:51] care is an anointing we have to respect
[26:54] the man of God Amen so we salute our
[26:57] pastor shame amen is past three score
[27:00] and 10.
[27:01] and the Lord has been gracious to him
[27:03] but he is so Faithfully serving the lord
[27:07] still Faithfully laboring in the
[27:09] vineyard
[27:10] still has a concern for souls and the
[27:13] Lord has given him a vision for Stanger
[27:16] and I believe the Lord is Blessing the
[27:17] fellowship there the Lord is raising up
[27:19] man amen to support the ministry and
[27:22] they are still laboring and witnessing
[27:23] to people amen so we are going to pray
[27:25] the blessing of the Lord be upon him we
[27:28] are going to pray the Holy the same age
[27:29] of God that's moving in the church will
[27:31] move in Stanger and they shall have a
[27:34] supernatural increase this year because
[27:36] that blessing is not just limited to
[27:38] this church but it's limited to
[27:39] whosoever will amen let him come and
[27:42] drink up the Fountain of Life freely
[27:45] amen and I I am blessed amen because
[27:49] every time I talk to Pastor Shane he's
[27:51] always encouraging us amen he's
[27:53] encouraging me in the ministry and
[27:55] that's very rare to find
[27:57] other Ministries to connect with your
[27:59] ministry and be able to say I've been
[28:02] listening to what you've been preaching
[28:03] and don't stop amen these are the exact
[28:06] word don't stop
[28:08] keep pressing on Amen

[28:17] amen we appreciate amen even without our
[28:20] Elder here brother sunny
[28:22] always encouraging the ministry amen now
[28:25] why I say that's rare
[28:28] sometimes all people forgive me for
[28:30] using that word but all the people in
[28:32] the ministry
[28:34] they can start to develop complexes
[28:37] and not try to lift up the younger
[28:40] Ministries but these brothers are not so
[28:42] amen
[28:43] their desire is to see the younger
[28:45] Ministry progress and move forward with
[28:47] the things of God Amen
[28:49] amen so when you'll be able to find
[28:52] things like that where you recognize you
[28:53] don't think that we don't recognize it
[28:55] amen is always texting me because
[28:58] brother is always texting me amen and we
[29:03] should always appreciate that
[29:05] that somebody is thinking about you

[29:10] somebody is trying to move you forward
[29:14] don't you think that's a marvelous thing

[30:17] instilling in them amen maybe he'll tell
[30:19] you about them sometime so encourage

[31:15] certain things in the youth meeting that
[31:16] maybe we won't address in the church
[31:18] here amen it'll be more focused amen
[31:21] it'll be more direct amen I'm expecting
[31:24] amen even this year I will get involved
[31:26] in some meetings brother Joshua will get
[31:28] involved in some meetings amen because
[31:30] we have a clear vision of where we want
[31:32] to go Gloria you can ask us our vision
[31:35] and we'll tell you because when there's
[31:37] no vision the people perish we have a
[31:40] vision for the church right near the
[31:42] pastor I think of you personally and I
[31:44] have a vision for an individual amen I
[31:47] have a vision for your family

[31:51] to you all the time I am committing you
[31:53] and your family before the Lord all the
[31:55] time
[32:00] and change a situation amen
[32:04] amen
[32:06] and believe me when you are covered
[32:08] under such an anointing there's no way
[32:10] your family will be the same

[32:14] the church and be a better support to
[32:17] the church amen to say brother I want to
[32:20] dedicate more of my time to this
[32:21] ministry remember God didn't bring you
[32:23] into this ministry just to occupy a Pew
[32:26] no amen right if you can put your
[32:28] shoulders to the wheel we can move
[32:30] forward we have a vision for outreach
[32:32] work we want to get that going because
[32:35] the support to that amen we want to see
[32:38] this go forward I don't understand you
[32:40] also amen who chats and books we are

[32:46] who's ready to come and do evangelism in
[32:48] the area amen
[32:49] foreign
[32:53] so we're going to go maybe we won't
[32:55] always announce it because that is not a
[32:57] a church ministry like what I'm saying
[32:59] in the settings of these four walls you
[33:01] might just hear that we're out here
[33:02] ministering without the administering
[33:05] we're out there doing an open end as the
[33:07] spirit of God leads we will move
[33:09] amen we've got to put the evangelists to
[33:12] work

[44:12] he said it's the seventh and we realized
[44:16] by Revelation and deep understanding and
[44:19] the progression of the Holy Ghost
[44:22] instilled in us there is a spiritual
[44:25] awakening there is a spiritual call
[44:28] and whatever that was out there there
[44:31] was a purpose
[44:33] God had to reveal that purpose to the
[44:37] end time message amen
[44:40] so that we know that the entire message

[45:58] yourself to a church and mystical body
[46:02] and this mystical body enhances
[46:07] the word of the Lord
[46:09] in spiritual discernment for you to be a
[46:15] partaker to be a son and a daughter of
[46:19] Almighty Amen in the mystical body so
[46:22] you are in a mystical body you are not
[46:25] here by accident yes
[46:27] your call was different
[46:29] your searching was different your
[46:32] mindset was different you couldn't
[46:35] understand yourself
[46:37] the only way you could understand
[46:38] yourself is by understanding God and God
[46:42] understand me
[46:45] because I'm further
[46:48] now watch I'm showing you certain things
[46:50] when
[46:51] it says when the Holy Ghost is come
[46:53] right he's come
[46:55] the Holy Ghost is come
[47:00] why did the proper bring these things
[47:02] for our admonition
[47:04] we need to learn amen we need to
[47:07] understand we need to search we need to
[47:10] it is the Bible we need to pray we need
[47:13] to ask God for revelation
[47:16] let's go
[47:18] marriage and divorce
[47:21] but now
[47:23] that the seals are open
[47:27] the spirit of Truth directs us to the
[47:31] world
[47:32] so now what is he trying to tell us here
[47:34] now there is something about the shields
[47:39] there is something about the seals yes
[47:41] there's something about you you are
[47:44] sealed in the seventh seal message amen
[47:47] amen you cannot come out of it yes the
[47:49] devil cannot take you out again amen you
[47:52] were prejestinated you are hearing the
[47:54] tearful recall amen
[47:56] is ancient but the amen that you are
[47:59] producing within yourself amen because
[48:02] that predestinated call that the
[48:05] Japanese is not something to be taken
[48:08] lightly it is a call of God Amen
[48:14] right that explains why all the mistakes
[48:18] has been down Through the Ages because
[48:21] the seals was not over yeah amen amen so
[48:28] you said no no no my father told me that
[48:31] church but sister said no no don't go to
[48:33] this I will go to that church and carry
[48:35] on and you are moving on joining this
[48:38] church joining that church right you're
[48:40] going to be careful of all this amen
[48:42] amen why did God
[48:45] be destinated you
[48:50] you know something
[48:52] you are very
[48:54] very
[48:56] special yes the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[48:59] you cannot understand yourself yes
[49:03] but the only way that you could
[49:05] understand yourself
[49:07] to get the Holy Ghost amen
[49:10] to get the Holy Ghost when he the Holy
[49:14] Ghost is come
[49:16] it will teach you
[49:18] he will tell you
[49:20] he will direct you
[49:22] in all manner of whatever
[49:25] the Bible tells you and what it will
[49:28] produce in your life
[49:31] your life speaks volumes
[49:34] can you say amen amen
[49:37] amen
[49:38] it speaks volumes your mind
[49:41] let us just look at some things
[49:44] that what changes the attitude of Our
[49:48] Lives
[49:51] in uh
[49:54] the word of the Lord unless we suffer
[49:57] with him
[49:59] he cannot reign with him amen nobody is
[50:02] a deceited here can say that you are not
[50:04] suffering yes you are suffering for the
[50:06] purpose amen you are suffering for some
[50:09] objective and meaningful time frame in
[50:13] life to get you out of a situation and
[50:18] that's only Jesus Christ can do that for
[50:21] you Okay the reason for this is a
[50:24] character simply is never me without
[50:27] suffering
[50:29] sometimes you say I don't know why my
[50:31] husband I don't know why my wife I don't
[50:32] know why my children I don't know this I
[50:34] don't know that you know why no Jesus
[50:37] you will know all things
[50:40] Canada is a victory
[50:42] not a gift
[50:44] a man without character can't Reign
[50:46] because power apart from character is
[50:49] satanic but Power good character is
[50:52] Victor who amen that is one of the idea
[50:54] amen the character with power expect to
[50:58] do amen tell us what we need to do what
[51:01] was under Sunday's no one knows see 24
[51:04] of the church is good but we need to
[51:06] know
[51:08] so what we tell you it will take the
[51:10] Revelation given by the prophet under
[51:14] the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:16] to enhance a characteristic of
