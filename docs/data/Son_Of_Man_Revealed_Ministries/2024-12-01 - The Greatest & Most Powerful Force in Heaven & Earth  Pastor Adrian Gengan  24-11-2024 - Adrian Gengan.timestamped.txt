[4:02] let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 13
[4:04] going to read amen a
[4:08] bit praise the Lord I'm going to speak
[4:11] this morning on the greatest and most
[4:13] powerful force in Heaven and Earth amen
[4:18] the greatest and most powerful force in
[4:19] Heaven and Earth amen CU that force that
[4:24] was in heaven came down to
[4:26] earth it says here in 1 Corinthians
[4:28] chapter 13
[4:30] though I speak with tongues of men and
[4:32] angels and have not charity have not
[4:35] love I am becoming I am become as a
[4:38] sounding brass or a tinkling
[4:41] symbol and though I have the gift of
[4:43] Prophecy Revelation 10:11 and understand
[4:46] all Mysteries Revelation 10:7 and all
[4:50] knowledge and though I have all Faith
[4:52] Mark
[4:53] 11:23 that I can remove mountains and
[4:56] have not charity I am nothing
[5:01] am
[5:03] amen you know what that word nothing
[5:07] means you become unknown I'm talking
[5:10] about the spiritual Kingdom of Jesus
[5:12] Christ you are not known in that Kingdom
[5:15] didn't the ones that come to Jesus say I
[5:16] cast out devils in your name I
[5:18] prophesied in your name Jesus said I
[5:20] never knew you so you become unknown in
[5:23] the Kingdom realm when you don't operate
[5:26] all of these gifts by the driving force
[5:28] which is love
[5:30] so we don't want to be unknown in the
[5:32] kingdom of God we want to be known am
[5:35] Hallelujah and though I bestow all my
[5:38] goods to feed the poor that's your Char
[5:40] charitable deeds and though I give my
[5:42] body to be burned that's become a martyr
[5:45] and have not charity it profited me
[5:48] nothing it doesn't add to any bit of my
[5:50] salvation nothing I can
[5:52] do amen charity suffered long is kind
[5:56] charity envieth not charity wanted not
[5:58] itself he's not puffed up does not
[6:01] behave itself unseemingly seeketh not
[6:03] her own is not easily provoked thinketh
[6:06] no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[6:09] rejoiceth in the truth beareth all
[6:11] things believeth all things hope all
[6:13] things endureth all things charity love
[6:17] never faileth but where there be
[6:20] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[6:22] be tongues they shall seize whether
[6:24] there be knowledge it shall vanish away
[6:27] for we know in part we prophesy in part
[6:29] but when that which is perfect is come
[6:31] then that which is in part shall be done
[6:33] away when I was a child I spake as a
[6:36] child I understood as a child I thought
[6:38] as a child but when I became a man I put
[6:41] away childish things so when I'm adopted
[6:44] I'm going to put away childish
[6:46] things for now we see through a glass
[6:49] Darkly but then face to face now I know
[6:51] in part but then shall I know even as I
[6:55] am also known and now abided faith hope
[6:58] charity these three but the greatest of
[7:00] these is Charity amen one more portion
[7:03] of scripture in John
[7:17] 13:35
[7:19] amen John 13:35 says by this shall all
[7:24] men know that you are my disciples if
[7:26] you have love one to another amen let's

[8:12] penetrate our souls oh God and Lord the
[8:14] gene of God will be quickened oh God to
[8:17] Lord add another part oh God lord to our
[8:19] perfection even this morning Lord Jesus
[8:22] I'm praying Lord for deliverance I'm
[8:23] praying for breakthrough I'm praying for
[8:25] miracles I'm praying for healing oh God
[8:27] even as your word is being ministered oh
[8:29] God pray the needs of the people who be
[8:31] met oh God lord we preach the word L God
[8:33] not in letter only but Lord in power and
[8:36] in demonstration oh God so even as the
[8:38] word is being preached I pray Lord the
[8:40] ministering spirits will go across the
[8:42] audience and meet them at the point of
[8:44] need I ask this Blessings Now in the
[8:46] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[8:48] Jesus Christ amen amen the Lord bless
[8:51] you may be seated amen we also want to
[8:53] welcome our brother Gabriel amen let's
[8:55] give our brother Gabriel a hand amen
[8:58] praise the Lord
[9:00] amen he's been fellowshipping there with
[9:01] Pastor Denzel amen I believe he's
[9:04] staying in school side at the moment or
[9:06] he's back with his mom so he told me
[9:07] he'll be fellowshipping here amen so we
[9:10] want to welcome you amen and pray amen
[9:12] that the Lord will be able to minister
[9:14] to you and speak to your heart this
[9:15] morning amen hallelujah amen turn to
[9:19] your neighbor and ask him are you
[9:22] ready you ready amen because once we
[9:25] take off there's no
[9:27] stopping amen we're not going to stop
[9:29] for anybody amen so buckle up your seat
[9:32] belts amen we're about to lift off take
[9:35] you into a higher Dimension even this
[9:37] morning amen praise the
[9:40] Lord
[9:43] so we want to say that there is a
[9:45] driving force behind the
[9:48] supernatural amen something that
[9:51] connects the natural to the
[9:54] supernatural to operate the supernatural
[9:56] there must be something Supernatural
[10:00] meaning that we what we are speaking
[10:02] about is not a natural
[10:05] element to produce natural
[10:08] results if we operate in what we are
[10:10] going to speak about this morning we are
[10:12] going to reap Supernatural
[10:16] results so if it's a Supernatural is not
[10:19] from the earth it's a supernatural
[10:23] force and when the supernatural Force
[10:26] collides with the Earth and and and and
[10:28] and connects with a man that's operating
[10:31] in
[10:32] [Music]
[10:33] faith then the man of the earth no
[10:36] longer operates in the natural sphere
[10:38] the natural realm is operating in a
[10:40] supernatural
[10:42] realm
[10:45] amen the Bible says in Romans chapter
[10:48] 8:14 that Sons and Daughters of God are
[10:51] led by the spirit of
[10:53] God Amen can I see the hands of Sons and
[10:56] Daughters of God Sons and Daughters of
[10:58] God are LED by the spirit of God what is
[11:01] that Spirit it is the Holy Ghost so we
[11:04] are being led by the Holy Ghost we are
[11:07] being governed by the Holy Ghost and the
[11:10] highest dimension of the Holy Ghost is
[11:12] what we are striving for in this time in
[11:15] this season amen we have been building
[11:17] from from a fith dimension a dimension
[11:20] of the Holy Ghost but we have been
[11:22] building an adding to our faith we've
[11:25] been adding virtue knowledge Temperance
[11:28] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[11:30] amen and and moving on now to charity
[11:34] which is love the highest
[11:36] Dimension now when we reach this stage
[11:38] or this level of our walk we are no
[11:41] longer operating in the realm of the
[11:43] five
[11:44] senses of the flesh or by natural
[11:49] laws now how many of you know that seven
[11:52] is God's
[11:53] number amen God doesn't stop at six
[11:59] amen amen seven is God's number so I'm
[12:02] asking you if we operate by five senses
[12:05] and the six sens is Faith what is the
[12:09] seven sense because you can't stop God
[12:12] at the six
[12:16] sense there's a
[12:18] sense and that not force behind the
[12:21] supernatural something that is producing
[12:24] faith in the hearts of the children of
[12:25] God in this
[12:27] hour amen remember what we are saying
[12:30] now we have all the seals we have all
[12:32] the Mysteries we have all of these
[12:34] things but they got to be a supernatural
[12:36] Force Amen to operate all of these
[12:38] Mysteries that we
[12:40] know praise the Lord so there is a seven
[12:43] sense that we want to attain and unlock
[12:46] to the
[12:47] believer amen praise the Lord now we in
[12:52] that season of aai
[12:53] 60 where sons and daughters have
[12:57] Arisen we have awaken from sleep we have
[13:01] heard the bridegroom's call at midnight
[13:03] going out to meet
[13:05] him amen we our light is shining and the
[13:09] glory of the Lord is risen upon us amen
[13:13] we are operating under Psalm 24 where we
[13:15] are ascending the hill of the Lord with
[13:17] Clean Hands and a pure
[13:21] heart amen put up Zechariah 4:7 there
[13:24] you'll see amen that the Capstone of
[13:26] Love is coming down with shoutings of
[13:28] Grace Grace
[13:32] yes
[13:34] Hallelujah now we know that in the Old
[13:36] Testament it was God above
[13:39] us in the New Testament amen it was God
[13:42] with us but God Amen now God wants to be
[13:46] in US yes amen God is not satisfied
[13:49] being up above us God is not satisfied
[13:52] being with us God wants to be in us
[13:55] that's why he sent the Holy Ghost
[13:59] amen he's descending like a dove amen
[14:03] God does not want amen you Amen to leave
[14:06] him outside of your internal
[14:09] beings God doesn't want the Holy Ghost
[14:11] on your flesh God doesn't want the holy
[14:14] ghost in your spirit but God wants the
[14:16] Holy Ghost to Quicken that Jean seed in
[14:18] your
[14:20] soul amen if it's only Quicken In the
[14:23] Flesh and spirit will be plain church
[14:26] that's the realm that God the prophet of
[14:28] God says that you can be Anointed with
[14:30] the Holy Ghost 24/7 and still go to hell
[14:33] how in the Realms of the Flesh and the
[14:34] Realms of the spirit but when the Holy
[14:37] Ghost quickens that c Gene that
[14:38] representation that came from God Amen
[14:41] you are no longer a son and daughter of
[14:43] the earth then you are no longer a son
[14:45] and daughter of your father and
[14:47] mother but you're a son and daughter of
[14:49] the Living
[14:51] God praise the Lord
[14:53] amen now there are two powerful forces
[14:56] on the Earth today both working for the
[14:58] soul of
[15:00] men the Earth amen is the Lords and the
[15:03] fullness thereof we know that's in
[15:04] scripture the Earth is the Lords and the
[15:06] fullness thereof and although it belongs
[15:09] to him he has put the Earth under the
[15:11] control of man Genesis amen 1 let them
[15:15] have dominion amen God has given the
[15:18] Earth Amen to man to have dominion
[15:21] praise the
[15:22] Lord hallelujah he gave man dominion
[15:25] over the Earth so God won't violate his
[15:27] own word
[15:31] God won't do anything on the earth
[15:33] unless he gets amen a man to cooperate
[15:35] with his plan praise the Lord because
[15:38] man on the Earth has the legal
[15:40] Authority praise the Lord God is always
[15:43] working with man he walked with Enoch he
[15:46] walked with Noah he walked with Abraham
[15:48] he walked with Moses he walked with
[15:50] Joshua he walked with the seven judges
[15:52] of Israel he worked with the Kings he
[15:55] worked with the prophets he worked with
[15:57] Paul irenius columus Martin amen Martin
[16:00] Luther Wesley he worked with William
[16:02] brandham and in this day he's working
[16:04] with sons and daughters of God the Bride
[16:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ God is always
[16:09] working with men amen praise the Lord
[16:13] amen and this bride has a peculiar
[16:16] quality she possesses something that
[16:19] none of the others
[16:21] possessed what she possesses is title
[16:23] deed back in a hand again Revelation 10
[16:26] brought down the title deed back to the
[16:27] Bride of Jesus Christ on the earth
[16:29] something that the others never
[16:32] have so what Adam lost the bride is not
[16:36] got what a special class of people we
[16:38] are amen I think we ought to give the
[16:40] Lord a good anim of praise for that amen
[16:42] that the Lord has given us back title
[16:45] deed praise the Lord amen amen now the
[16:48] prophet of God is going to tell us some
[16:50] secret now we we we know that the
[16:52] prophet of God was accused by and and
[16:54] not just accused but he was told by the
[16:56] angel of God you explain the gift too
[16:58] much you gave away too much because of
[17:01] his compassion and his heart for the
[17:02] people amen but he's going to give us
[17:06] Secrets
[17:07] amen praise the Lord in that in that
[17:10] quote there now it says but let tell you
[17:13] a little
[17:14] secret the most powerful force in the
[17:17] world isn't speaking with tongues or
[17:19] interpreting tongues or being honored by
[17:22] God to be a minister to be an evangelist
[17:24] or to be a prophet the most powerful
[17:27] weapon that I've ever found in my life
[17:29] is love
[17:35] amen I I want to make a statement that I
[17:38] think some that that maybe majority of
[17:40] us have not been operating out of this
[17:42] Force we've trying to be operate with
[17:45] faith can we get honest people we've
[17:48] been trying to operate with
[17:50] faith not realizing the
[17:54] secret praise the Lord remember there
[17:56] faith hope and charity but the greatest
[17:58] is what the prophet is saying the secret
[18:02] hallelujah amen the most powerful weapon
[18:05] most powerful force on the earth I found
[18:07] in my life is
[18:11] love now he says there's filo love
[18:13] there's there's types of love this F of
[18:16] love which is the Greek word comes from
[18:17] Friendship like you have for your wife
[18:20] there's a difference it's it'll make a
[18:23] mother for that baby run into a blazing
[18:26] fire a life means nothing that's filal
[18:29] what will agape love do The Godly love
[18:32] now you know the prophet of God I'm
[18:34] going to go through the story very
[18:35] quickly the prophet of God is talking
[18:37] about these two girls who are coming
[18:38] home from college and they were riding
[18:40] the train and the mother was waiting
[18:43] there at the train station to greet her
[18:46] daughter so when the the mother saw the
[18:48] daughter coming from the train she was
[18:50] so excited and she say my darling how
[18:52] are you and these two girls amen before
[18:55] they got up there looking at each other
[18:57] and the one friend told this girl
[18:59] who's that ugly looking woman
[19:01] there and she was so embarrassed of her
[19:04] mother amen because the mother was like
[19:06] burned on her face had scars on her face
[19:10] amen and there was a conductor standing
[19:13] and listening to this
[19:14] conversation and she told her friend I
[19:16] don't know who that woman
[19:18] is
[19:22] hallelujah and the conductor stopped her
[19:26] and she said aren't you ashamed of
[19:27] yourself yes
[19:29] we know the story of your mother when
[19:31] you were a child you were trapped in a
[19:32] burning building and your mother was a
[19:35] beautiful young
[19:37] woman but the love in her heart for you
[19:39] she didn't want to leave you in that
[19:41] burning
[19:42] building the firefighters tried to stop
[19:44] her and tell her you can't go into the
[19:46] house but the love of the mother ran
[19:48] into a burning building to save her
[19:51] daughter and says now you stand here and
[19:54] you embarrassed and ashamed of your
[19:57] mother now if the love of a mother will
[20:00] make her run into a burning building the
[20:03] love of a s a father God Amen sent down
[20:06] his son to the Earth because his sons
[20:09] and daughters were
[20:10] lost if I can say it this way hell was
[20:13] on the earth and God sent his son into
[20:15] hell on the earth to rescue his sons and
[20:17] daughters amen yes Lord thank you praise
[20:21] the
[20:22] Lord John 3:16 God so loved the world
[20:26] that he gave his only begotten son that
[20:28] whoever should believe on him should not
[20:30] perish but have everlasting
[20:32] life amen praise the Lord the prophet of
[20:36] God says we must love divinely love one
[20:39] another then you don't see your
[20:41] brother's
[20:42] mistake what's the first thing we see
[20:44] when we see somebody taken up in a fault
[20:47] we tell somebody we want to talk about
[20:50] it he says but you must love one another
[20:53] then you don't see your brother's so
[20:55] what I'm saying if you've always been
[20:56] seeing your brother's mistakes you will
[20:58] not not operating in love because he
[21:00] says love don't make you see your
[21:02] brother's mistake
[21:04] amen amen why am I reading it wrong he
[21:08] says then you don't see your brother's
[21:10] mistake if he does make a mistake you
[21:13] never you look over the top of it and
[21:15] you love him
[21:17] anyhow praise the Lord that's it love
[21:20] those that love
[21:22] you then does not the sinner do the same
[21:25] thing but love those who doesn't love
[21:27] you amen amen praise the Lord that's
[21:30] what the spirit of God is in you cuz he
[21:33] loved you when you were his enemy and he
[21:35] loved you and that Spirits in you it'll
[21:37] make you love your enemy as you do your
[21:43] friend he says whether your neighbor
[21:45] treats you right or not you love him
[21:47] anyhow that's right whether he agrees
[21:49] with you or not you love him anyhow
[21:51] that's the way you got to do it that's
[21:54] the hidden
[21:55] life that's the consecrated life
[21:59] that's the life that veils of the worlds
[22:01] and you're shut off from the things of
[22:02] the world you only live in Christ you
[22:05] see what I mean
[22:06] church amen so if we want to learn how
[22:10] to operate in the super anointing that
[22:11] the prophet talks
[22:13] about
[22:15] amen how do we get this agape
[22:18] love God knows there's nothing we can do
[22:20] on our own to generate this kind of a
[22:23] love we can't manufacture this kind of a
[22:27] love so he sent something to equip us
[22:30] with this kind of a
[22:31] love and it's the one thing that people
[22:34] don't
[22:35] want it's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[22:39] puts the love of God in our hearts
[22:41] Galatians 5:22 says that the fruit of
[22:45] the spirit is love
[22:48] amen praise the
[22:51] Lord so we have human love fully of love
[22:56] this love is found in all humans be it
[22:58] Christian or non-christians you find
[23:00] good people who love amen when you look
[23:03] at them you can admire them the way they
[23:05] love for Humanity The Love For Animals
[23:08] the love for nature amen they have a
[23:12] natural
[23:13] love but the love we're talking about
[23:15] supersedes this kind of a love yes
[23:19] amen
[23:23] amen we are talking about the essence of
[23:25] God God is love so how do we get the
[23:28] kind of love we know that Divine love is
[23:30] an attribute of the Holy
[23:33] Ghost we can Love Like Jesus loved when
[23:37] we get the Holy
[23:40] Ghost we can heal like Jesus healed when
[23:43] we get the Holy
[23:44] Ghost we can deliver like Jesus
[23:47] delivered when we get the Holy Ghost
[23:49] because the same spirit that was in
[23:51] Jesus is in the body of Christ
[23:55] amen no wonder the book of Acts could
[23:57] operate like like that they were filled
[23:59] with the Holy
[24:00] Ghost they were no different to
[24:04] Jesus thank they operated with the same
[24:06] power with the same anointing amen amen
[24:09] so much so the religious world was
[24:12] rocked amen they didn't know how to
[24:13] handle them so they had to kill them
[24:15] like they killed
[24:19] Jesus it's the only way they could stop
[24:22] it but the move of God is Unstoppable
[24:25] amen you kill this body of Flesh the
[24:27] Holy Ghost will raise up another son and
[24:28] daughter of God Amen to equip the
[24:32] church amen praise the
[24:36] Lord so
[24:38] amen I also am saying that this elements
[24:44] and this Dimension can remain
[24:47] untapped we can come to church we can
[24:50] enjoy the mysteries of God but there are
[24:53] dimensions of the Holy Ghost that we can
[24:54] leave
[24:55] untapped the prophet of God would talk
[24:58] about untapped resources if you want to
[25:00] search it up search up untapped
[25:02] resources there are resources available
[25:05] to the body of Christ but they are not
[25:07] touched people don't want to delve into
[25:09] those
[25:10] Realms people don't have faith enough to
[25:13] move up into those Realms why they are
[25:15] satisfied with just certain portions of
[25:18] the word but the body of Jesus Christ
[25:20] The Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ as
[25:22] the full opening of the word and she
[25:25] operates in all dimensions of the Holy
[25:27] Ghost amen thank you Lord praise the
[25:33] Lord so we don't want to leave things
[25:35] untapped we don't want to have untapped
[25:38] resources amen if we choose not to
[25:40] utilize all that the father has unlocked
[25:42] to us in this adoption
[25:45] season when you come to adoption there's
[25:47] an expectation for you to handle the
[25:49] father's
[25:51] business that is why he adopts you he
[25:54] gives you the robe he gives you the ring
[25:56] he gives you the Seal of authority that
[25:58] all that you fire is fired and all that
[26:01] you hire is
[26:03] hired whatever you bind on Earth is
[26:05] bound in heaven whatever you loose on
[26:07] Earth is loosed in heaven father has a
[26:09] responsibility for Sons and Daughters of
[26:12] God and Sons and Daughters of God have
[26:14] got to step up to this
[26:16] responsibility father doesn't bring us
[26:18] to adoption for us to to wander and live
[26:20] an endless life and not be involved in
[26:22] this Kingdom
[26:24] realm praise the
[26:26] Lord so in the season of adoption when
[26:29] the adoption season is here it takes the
[26:31] ability amen it takes the ability of
[26:34] Sons and Daughters of God Amen we've got
[26:36] to take responsibility and start to
[26:39] exercise our rights and our
[26:41] responsibilities in our father's
[26:44] Kingdom and like we were teaching Amen
[26:46] on the on the Wednesday your identity
[26:48] unlocks your
[26:49] Authority if you don't know who you are
[26:52] you can never operate in your
[26:54] Authority so that's why God came to take
[26:56] away Amnesia with the opening of the the
[26:58] word to reveal our true identity so that
[27:01] we can operate in our Authority amen
[27:04] praise the Lord
[27:06] amen so we cannot live our lives using
[27:09] human fil your love that won't work amen
[27:13] love in the kingdom of God that is amen
[27:15] we know that he fighting amen the
[27:17] kingdom of Satan I'm saying that again
[27:20] that love in the kingdom of God is
[27:22] fighting the kingdom of
[27:24] Satan not
[27:26] works not our own good Deeds love is
[27:30] what the Conquering force
[27:32] is praise the
[27:35] Lord so we must tap into Divine laws in
[27:38] this
[27:39] season praise the lord we must tap into
[27:42] Divine principles if we want to see
[27:44] Divine
[27:45] results if we want to experience a
[27:47] supernatural we can't remain Earthbound
[27:49] In the
[27:51] Flesh you know what the definition is of
[27:53] insanity
[27:56] is tell us brother
[28:04] amen we doing the same things over and
[28:06] over
[28:07] again expecting a different result but
[28:10] we're not getting a different result so
[28:13] the prophet of God says if you want you
[28:16] got to tap into untapped resources if
[28:19] you want a different result amen we've
[28:22] got to work with spiritual laws to
[28:24] encounter the supernatural prophet of
[28:26] God now goes back amen we're going back
[28:27] to to the quote now and love is the most
[28:30] powerful force that there is in the
[28:32] world and if you notice a devil is
[28:35] always hate so if we have hate in our
[28:39] hearts that's of the devil we need to
[28:40] get rid of
[28:42] it amen we can't hate anybody yes amen
[28:48] amen hate is of the devil and when
[28:51] people hate someone remember it is a
[28:54] terrible devil to despise or
[28:56] dislike you you mustn't do
[28:59] that tell your neighbor you mustn't do
[29:02] that no hate praise the
[29:07] Lord and you never cast a devil out by a
[29:12] wrong
[29:13] attitude so we're learning something
[29:15] else now attitude PS a plays an
[29:17] important role in operating the
[29:20] Supernatural and in Deliverance Ministry
[29:24] because you can't cast out a demon with
[29:25] a wrong attitude right
[29:28] what he says it takes what to do that
[29:32] Faith what is he saying it takes love to
[29:36] do
[29:40] that love that moved a mighty God God
[29:43] who love the world that he gave his only
[29:45] begotten son he says love is a great
[29:47] keynote thing we leave
[29:50] out it's something that's Eternal so
[29:53] it's from another realm it's from that
[29:55] seven Dimension amen it's it's the most
[29:58] powerful force that stops anything there
[30:00] is is
[30:03] love so I'm saying whatever situation
[30:06] you're going through love can be that
[30:07] foret stops
[30:11] IT praise the Lord now remember it takes
[30:14] our attitude we can choose to respond to
[30:16] that situation out of the human element
[30:18] or we can allow this great love Spirit
[30:20] to overtake us and then from that
[30:23] Dimension now we operate I am not going
[30:26] to allow that negativity to affect me
[30:29] yes or your actions now to change my
[30:32] entire
[30:34] atmosphere you see when when we start to
[30:36] operate like this we live in a world
[30:38] unto ourselves we live in a world that
[30:40] nobody knew about I'm quoting now
[30:42] perfect Faith Jesus lived in a world
[30:44] that nobody
[30:45] knew he was so in control of his
[30:47] emotions so in control amen because why
[30:50] St John 5:19 the son can do nothing but
[30:54] what he sees the father do that doth the
[30:57] son likewise
[30:59] amen the prophet says love
[31:02] God love God's love is the most powerful
[31:05] thing that there is in the world it
[31:07] conquers
[31:09] anything love conquers
[31:13] backbiting love conquers
[31:15] jealousy love conquers Petty differences
[31:18] love conquers our differences in
[31:20] Doctrine love conquers all
[31:24] things we had one Prophet with one
[31:27] message but different interpretations of
[31:29] that message has caused divisions
[31:31] amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[31:33] the most powerful force was left out to
[31:35] solve that
[31:39] problem had we used love we could have
[31:41] settled our
[31:44] differences
[31:46] Hallelujah you won't be playing with the
[31:48] elephants
[31:50] here or you won't be playing with the
[31:52] elephant's
[31:55] trunk whoever gave that analogy must
[31:58] have been an ant have you ever went to

[32:14] big you never knew what you were looking
[32:18] at you see how foolish we are in our
[32:20] analogies you always know what you're
[32:22] looking at so how come that analogy is
[32:25] oh I am playing with the ear I'm playing
[32:28] with the
[32:29] tail I'm playing with the nose with the
[32:34] trunk
[32:36] amen you can see the picture clearly now
[32:40] you know what you're looking at stop
[32:42] playing with a
[32:44] trunk praise the
[32:46] Lord now I want to the prophet here is
[32:48] breaking this down I want to read it
[32:50] slowly love is the most powerful thing
[32:52] that there is in the world it conquers
[32:54] Anything Is Love by this you shall
[32:59] conquer by Divine
[33:02] love loving one another number
[33:05] one loving the cause of God Number Two
[33:09] Loving Christ number three loving
[33:12] suffering Humanity number four he says
[33:15] that's how you
[33:18] conquer so you got to have a love for
[33:20] God you got to have love for one another
[33:24] amen you got to have a love for the
[33:25] cause of God you got to love suffering
[33:27] human it how else are we going to sigh
[33:29] and cry for the Abominations in the city
[33:31] if we don't love them you know you can't
[33:34] cry and sigh because of of
[33:38] frustration you can't sign and cry for
[33:40] the Abominations done in the city
[33:42] because you are frustrated with the
[33:43] evils that are going on no you've got to
[33:47] operate by this powerful force because
[33:49] you love you are sighing and you are
[33:51] crying love for Humanity that they are
[33:54] going to
[33:56] perish no amens on that amen hallelujah
[34:00] he says that's how you
[34:03] conquer yes Matthew 5:44 to 46 here what
[34:08] the Lord Jesus says but I say unto you
[34:11] love your
[34:12] enemies this is our Lord Jesus Christ
[34:15] teaching us how to operate like Adam
[34:18] love your
[34:20] enemies bless them that curse
[34:24] you who
[34:28] they're calling your names they cursing
[34:30] you so now you can't say you're lucky
[34:34] I'm not that old
[34:38] man hey now you can't
[34:43] say love where's my bush
[34:48] knife you can't say let Bush knifes for
[34:51] Bob your
[34:53] eyes what you got to do now how many of
[34:56] us have
[34:58] practically done this you've blessed
[35:02] someone who was swearing at you and
[35:05] cursing
[35:06] you but that's what Jesus is
[35:09] saying he's saying love your
[35:12] enemies bless them that curse you now I
[35:15] must stop there and tell you don't love
[35:17] the
[35:20] devil some of you will think hey the
[35:22] pastor gave me license now I can love
[35:23] the
[35:25] devil you must not love the devil
[35:32] bless them that curse
[35:33] you now I'm speaking these things so we
[35:36] can start to apply it practically so the
[35:38] next time as soon as you leave this door
[35:39] somebody comes to curse you and revile
[35:41] against you and say all manner of things
[35:43] against you you're going to bless them
[35:47] if you don't know how to bless them this
[35:49] is how you bless them God bless
[35:51] you
[35:55] yes do good to them that do good to
[36:00] you do good to them that give you
[36:04] gifts now Jesus is saying people that
[36:07] hate you you must do good to them which
[36:09] means you're going to have to go out of
[36:10] your way to do good to
[36:14] them which means that that cake you
[36:16] wanted to buy for your sister because
[36:18] you love your sister you must now buy
[36:20] the cake for that one who hates
[36:23] you but I thought we want to be like
[36:26] Jesus amen to be like
[36:29] Jesus all I can hear is the
[36:32] fan no
[36:34] amens praise the
[36:37] Lord what is he saying do good how many
[36:41] of us have done good to people who hate
[36:42] us amen but I'm talking about a
[36:45] practical gospel now if you want to
[36:47] operate in this love
[36:49] Dimension you start to do good to them
[36:51] that hate
[36:52] you and pray for them that despitefully
[36:56] use you which means you know now they're
[36:58] using you but you're going to pray for
[37:00] them while they using
[37:03] you while they using
[37:06] you you're going to be praying for
[37:11] them and persecute
[37:13] you that you may be the children of your
[37:16] father which is in heaven you see what
[37:18] he's saying for you to become an adopted
[37:20] son of God and reflect his character and
[37:22] nature you have to do these
[37:25] things for he maketh the San to rise on
[37:28] the evil and on the
[37:30] good and send it rain on the just and on
[37:33] the unjust for if you love them which
[37:36] love you what reward have you do not
[37:39] even the publicans the
[37:42] same tell your neighbor I just love that
[37:44] what Jesus said tell him I'm going to
[37:46] practice
[37:48] that some of you are not saying it
[37:50] because you're not going to come on I'm
[37:51] going to practice this now I'm going to
[37:53] love them that hate me I'm going to do
[37:55] good to them that hate me I'm going to
[37:57] bless them that curs me yes amen now
[38:00] Jesus won't say something if he himself
[38:02] won't manifest it if you look at Luke
[38:04] 23:34
[38:07] there Jesus on the
[38:09] cross
[38:11] beaten
[38:12] bruised
[38:14] nailed others these words then Jesus
[38:17] said father forgive
[38:20] them for they know not what they do so
[38:24] if a baton bruised uh nailed Jesus on
[38:27] the cross can still forgive
[38:30] people how about us amen
[38:36] yes
[38:37] amen the Propet of God again the
[38:40] mightiest Force there is on the earth is
[38:43] love there's nothing that will break
[38:45] down
[38:46] love
[38:47] Hallelujah there is nothing that will
[38:49] break down love so marriages can't break
[38:52] down if it's built on love am there is
[38:55] nothing that can break down love
[38:58] so friendships can't be broken down
[39:00] because of
[39:02] love so homes can't be torn apart
[39:05] because nothing can break down
[39:09] love amen hallelujah no matter what it
[39:13] is see the prophet is saying no matter
[39:15] what it is nothing can break down if
[39:17] you're operating by
[39:19] love yes amen relationships can't be
[39:23] broken sir if you're operating by love
[39:26] amen which means you can't say from this
[39:29] day ends Let It Be written let it be
[39:32] known from this day ends let the name of
[39:34] this person be stricken from every
[39:37] book I'm quoting Moses now if you ever
[39:39] saw Ten
[39:41] Commandments
[39:42] Pharaoh let the name of Moses be
[39:45] stricken from every
[39:47] book so we can't be writing people off
[39:50] is what I am
[39:53] saying amen yes you can't be telling
[39:56] them from this day on I got no more
[39:59] sister from this day forward I'm an
[40:04] orphan Love Will Conquer everything amen
[40:08] you see these are the mental battles
[40:10] people face nobody loves me you keep
[40:13] saying that nobody will love you because
[40:15] you're confessing
[40:17] that
[40:19] Hallelujah nothing good ever happens to
[40:21] me well you live by your confession
[40:24] that's
[40:25] right Jesus said you have no not because
[40:27] you ask not it works in the other way as
[40:30] well what you're asking that's how
[40:32] you're
[40:33] living praise the
[40:35] Lord amen amen nothing can break down
[40:39] love no matter what it is but until love
[40:42] anchors in your heart you're still out
[40:43] of God that's right you have you've got
[40:47] to have love the Bible says God is love
[40:50] the love is the strongest force if you
[40:52] want to be a real outstanding person in
[40:54] the
[40:55] church I if you you want to be an
[40:57] outstanding person in the church
[40:59] wherever whereever Church you go to just
[41:02] fall in love with God with all your
[41:04] heart and when you do that you will fall
[41:06] in love with every member of your
[41:09] church and every member of everybody
[41:12] else's church with your all your heart
[41:14] see not only fall in love with your
[41:15] church the prophet is said saying fall
[41:18] in love with everyone else's members
[41:21] too I know other people love our members
[41:29] praise the Lord thank Lord you can't
[41:32] Bluff that now there's something about
[41:35] it that people know if there's anything
[41:37] I can contribute to the success of my
[41:39] meeting Earthly speaking is to know that
[41:42] people have a conscience that I truly
[41:44] love people now watch this is going to
[41:46] help the ministry
[41:48] now people must be able to see that you
[41:50] love them that you care for them that
[41:52] you're concerned about
[41:55] them otherwise we shouldn't be preaching
[41:57] we don't have that love for
[41:59] them the love is trying to bring them up
[42:02] to a level so that they can operate as
[42:03] Sons and Daughters of
[42:06] God
[42:08] Amen he says I just love people and they
[42:12] know that and you can't fool them on
[42:15] that here in another quote blind BTO ma
[42:18] he says you know why I can help you it's
[42:21] because you love me and you believe me
[42:29] I'm trying to bring Clarity to the angel
[42:31] speaking to the prophet if you get the
[42:33] people to believe you but the driving
[42:35] force behind the believing was what love
[42:39] his love for the people and the people's
[42:41] love
[42:42] for so can you see that the angel
[42:45] telling the prophet if you get the
[42:46] people to believe you there was a
[42:48] driving force behind that the prophet is
[42:51] giving it away here you know why I can
[42:54] help you is because you love me
[42:57] and you believe
[43:00] me see if you didn't believe me no
[43:03] matter what kind of works God would do
[43:05] by me you still wouldn't get any benefit
[43:08] do you know that that's my success with
[43:10] the Lord the people love me and I love
[43:15] them praise the Lord and that's where
[43:19] the success comes
[43:22] from love will do it he says I've been a
[43:25] great lover of Wildlife and I've noticed
[43:28] in animal life if you love animals if
[43:30] you love them you can do anything with
[43:32] them you want to and if you don't love
[43:34] them they know it if you're afraid of
[43:37] them like a biting dog if somebody said
[43:39] the dog will bite and if you afraid of
[43:41] him you're going to get a bit you're
[43:43] going to get
[43:45] bit now you're not going to fool him you
[43:47] might say I'm not afraid of him that
[43:50] better come from somewhere beside your
[43:51] lips cuz he knows better if you're not
[43:54] afraid of him it's different divine love
[43:57] is the most powerful forces it's the
[44:00] greatest force in the world and when
[44:02] Divine love has been projected and comes
[44:04] to its end then Sovereign Grace will
[44:06] take its place watch now there's a
[44:08] there's a there's a process happening
[44:10] here he says when Divine love is being
[44:14] projected he says Sovereign Grace now
[44:17] will come in on the scene and what will
[44:19] it
[44:21] do it will
[44:24] project Sovereign Grace will take its
[44:26] place
[44:29] he says give me a consecrated life
[44:31] that's dead rose again in Jesus Christ
[44:33] who lives in the Shak of Glory with the
[44:36] love of God around them that's the
[44:38] person I believe is going to be there
[44:40] put me beneath the veil under the blood
[44:42] of the Lord take all your gifts you have
[44:44] in the scripture the devil can
[44:46] impersonate every one of them oh yes
[44:49] right but he can't impersonate love amen
[44:54] so love when anyone loves you you know
[44:56] that can't be of of the
[44:58] devil when you're operating in Divine
[45:01] love you know that can't be of the devil
[45:02] because the devil will never impersonate
[45:05] love yes
[45:08] amen it's too pure amen it's the seven
[45:12] sense it's something he knows nothing
[45:14] about amen yes yes is that the secret
[45:18] beneath the
[45:19] seal that he knows nothing
[45:23] about yes and it don't matter that he
[45:26] hears me even saying it now because he
[45:27] can't impersonate love
[45:31] yes amen thank you Lord yes praise the
[45:36] Lord he can't impersonate love cuz love
[45:39] is genuine the devil can't love that's
[45:41] one thing he can't do and when you are
[45:43] to a place that you love one another and
[45:46] all the world is dead if you love God he
[45:49] says how many love him with real Divine
[45:51] Love Now how do you do that here's one
[45:54] witness because you have L one for
[45:56] another so he says the first sign is you
[45:58] love one another then you're starting to
[46:01] operate in Divine love
[46:03] now that's right we know we have passed
[46:05] from Death unto life when we love our
[46:08] Brethren he says love conquers it's just
[46:11] the most conquering Force there is
[46:12] because it's of God Amen we got to go
[46:14] quickly now amen because we are going to
[46:17] close praise the
[46:21] Lord he says I looked back at so here
[46:24] the prophet is talking about that bull
[46:26] now
[46:27] and he says I looked back at the fence
[46:29] it was too far to run no tree to get to
[46:31] it and there I was standing there and
[46:33] here he come he says something happened
[46:36] he's trying to show you now something
[46:37] came over him something happened I wish
[46:41] that would happen all the
[46:44] time right he just don't do it but when
[46:47] I see a tremendous sick case and
[46:49] something happens it's not man it's when
[46:52] God can get a hold of man it's when it's
[46:55] consecrated so man operating out of
[46:58] divine love is a different kind of a
[47:04] man amen amen that's why the prophet
[47:07] could walk into a hospital room and
[47:08] people will be
[47:10] discharged he's operating from a
[47:12] different
[47:15] realm and and I see the church tapping
[47:18] into those
[47:22] things praise the Lord
[47:27] watch on the platform when the Visions
[47:29] happen when evil spirits moving up watch
[47:31] takes place it's what brother Bram is
[47:34] given the secret but nobody wants it
[47:36] it's what
[47:40] surrender hey we're not reading this
[47:42] together what's happening here it's what
[47:44] it's a
[47:47] surrender it's a
[47:49] surrender to the Holy Spirit he comes in
[47:53] and takes over so when you are saying
[47:56] Supernatural taking place you know that
[47:58] man of God is Anointed by the Holy Ghost
[48:01] the devil can't cast out
[48:03] Devils Kingdom of Satan is not divided
[48:05] against itself when you are seeing
[48:08] people being healed delivered restored
[48:10] set free amen that's the power of the
[48:12] Holy Ghost operating through Sons and
[48:14] Daughters of
[48:17] God now why am I telling you this we've
[48:20] got to start to recognize the power of

[48:35] Ghost this is a holy ghost fill son and
[48:37] daughter of

[48:42] person so I can't treat them with
[48:43] content I can't treat them from a
[48:45] natural
[48:47] emotion praise the Lord amen he says he
[48:51] comes in and takes over watch how he
[48:54] controls it just watch how it takes
[48:56] place it's God it's not man am and if we

[52:34] forever more fear not get that
[52:37] atmosphere around you where you are not
[52:39] afraid now he says this takes an
[52:42] atmosphere get the atmosphere he says
[52:45] You must come with that kind of an
[52:47] attitude have the real thing first it
[52:50] will produce the rest of
[52:52] it if we have the real thing first it'll
[52:55] produce the rest of of
[52:57] it thank you Lord I'm going to dramatize
[53:00] this but the quote is there you can put
[53:01] it up amen the prophet of God is mowing
[53:03] his lawn amen and he was covered with
[53:06] Hornets he was there he took his shirt
[53:09] off and he was mowing the lawn he says
[53:11] he he hit the Hornet's Nest and the
[53:13] Hornets were all over his
[53:17] body right he says I was covered all
[53:20] over with hits don't never hate
[53:24] love so when you are covered with
[53:26] negative of words you are covered amen
[53:28] oppression you are covered with
[53:29] depression and people are coming against
[53:31] you you are covered with it don't ever
[53:33] ate
[53:35] love love is what conquers instead of
[53:38] hating those Hornets I loved the little
[53:41] fellows that sounds juvenile but it's
[53:45] true
[53:47] amen and I said little creatures of God
[53:50] I'm sorry I Disturbed you this is your
[53:53] home I know the sisters don't want to
[53:55] talk to the Cor approaches like that
[53:58] now I am sorry I Disturbed you this is
[54:01] your
[54:02] home but I'm a servant of God and
[54:05] praying for sick children and many are
[54:07] waiting I haven't time to play with
[54:12] you run on up to your nest right quick
[54:15] in Jesus name and leave me alone I won't
[54:18] bother you no more and God my eternal
[54:20] judge knows that they formed a circle
[54:22] and went straight back to their nest
[54:24] amen love
[54:28] Hallelujah atmosphere the
[54:32] atmosphere there's something about it
[54:35] now do you realize being a son and
[54:36] daughter of God that you're a minor
[54:39] Creator do you know that you can create
[54:41] the atmosphere that you live in do you
[54:44] realize that the atmosphere that you
[54:45] dwell in you influence somebody
[54:48] else what makes people act the way they
[54:51] do is because what makes the drunks like
[54:54] to be with drunks
[54:56] as my mother used to say in old proverb
[54:58] and I think it's sou too birds of a
[55:01] feather flock together because they have
[55:03] things in common so that's why we love
[55:06] gathering with children of God we have
[55:08] things in common amen God moves in
[55:10] nature love conquers everything and when
[55:13] love is projected Grace comes in to help
[55:15] it am now watch it's going to bring
[55:18] another element when we start to pro
[55:20] project the Divine love Grace is going
[55:23] to come in
[55:26] then it's real conquering
[55:28] love he says when Divine love led by the
[55:31] Holy Ghost is projected think of it the
[55:34] love of God and the grace of God brought
[55:36] an airplane out of the Skies talking
[55:39] about Ana
[55:41] now and set it on the ground held it
[55:44] there because of an ignorant colored
[55:45] woman prayer in faith you all know that
[55:47] story a son was dying with this veneral
[55:50] disease she prayed and she said Lord I'm
[55:53] your shite woman where is your Elijah
[55:56] God honored the faith of that woman he
[55:58] caused a
[56:00] storm that plane had to be grounded
[56:02] because the prophet was on the
[56:04] plane and while he was there posting
[56:06] letters the holy spirit amen because
[56:08] there was a delay now in the flight
[56:10] until it got again and he was going to
[56:11] post a letter and the Holy Spirit told
[56:13] him go down this way and he was
[56:15] directing him and he came right in front
[56:17] of this gate of this woman and the woman
[56:19] said good morning
[56:21] person he says it was love that caught
[56:25] you see what what what what is the
[56:26] prophet saying here the love of God and
[56:29] the grace of God brought a plane out of
[56:32] the Skies set it on the ground held it
[56:35] there because an ignorant colored
[56:38] woman's prayer in faith than you Lord
[56:41] amen
[56:43] amen you see and her love for a little
[56:47] boy if it'll do that for that what will
[56:50] it do to a born again group of people
[56:53] who sitting together like we are here
[56:58] Love Will Conquer anything don't
[57:01] practice so much of whether your gifts
[57:03] or not but practice that one real gift
[57:05] of love then you'd be
[57:08] better love conquers all thing love the
[57:11] Lord with all your heart all your soul
[57:12] all your mind with all your strength and
[57:14] faith will accompany that
[57:17] love right he's talking about now the
[57:20] man that was going to come and crush
[57:22] crush him on the stage there and hit him
[57:24] he said and he made a great big threat
[57:27] and before I could say anything the Holy
[57:29] Spirit began to speak and instead of
[57:31] hating the man I loved
[57:33] him and the love of God was projected to
[57:36] him and he rolled around his big eyes
[57:38] like that fell on my feet in the floor
[57:40] love
[57:44] conquered
[57:47] amen let's skip the next one and go to
[57:49] the one where he says God gave the holy
[57:51] spirit
[57:54] amen he says brother God gave the Holy
[57:57] Spirit God's love to control the
[58:01] church amen the Holy Spirit not smart
[58:05] educated but love gift goes in the
[58:07] church but he don't control the church
[58:10] love controls the church he quotes John
[58:13] 3:16 his love constrained him to do it
[58:16] right I'm driving a point here now
[58:18] because this is what I want to get to
[58:20] when a love is constrained then
[58:21] Sovereign Grace projects its
[58:24] object may I say that that again when
[58:27] Divine love is projected Grace produces
[58:30] its object am yes indeed when you love
[58:33] God so much Sovereign Grace will project
[58:36] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[58:38] make you live love and be a real
[58:41] Christian so I'm saying when when Divine
[58:43] love is projected over the
[58:48] sick Sovereign Grace will produce
[58:52] healing now let's understand it really
[58:55] now if you want to see the Supernatural
[58:57] in another
[58:59] way when we are praying for the sick he
[59:02] says Divine love must be projected so
[59:05] that Sovereign Grace will produce
[59:08] healing is everybody understanding the
[59:11] quote what about when Divine love is
[59:14] projected over those that are bound
[59:16] those that are captive Sovereign Grace
[59:18] will produce Deliverance chains will be
[59:21] broken amen how about when when Divine
[59:24] love is projected over the broken
[59:26] hearted Grace will project the bomb to
[59:29] heal that broken
[59:31] heartall what about when when Divine
[59:34] love is projected over a disagreement
[59:36] and
[59:37] argument broken relationships Grace will
[59:40] produce
[59:41] reconciliation amen Grace will produce
[59:46] forgiveness amen what we talking about
[59:49] the Divine now can we see the key
[59:51] element here is divine love what about
[59:54] when Divine love is projected over your
[59:56] lack when Divine love is projected over
[1:00:00] amen your shortcomings amen maybe Divine
[1:00:02] love is projected over your
[1:00:05] finances Sovereign Grace will project
[1:00:08] will produce
[1:00:10] abundance come on now somebody's not
[1:00:12] getting this I said when when when
[1:00:14] Divine love is projected over your
[1:00:17] lack over your
[1:00:19] shortcomings over your finances or maybe
[1:00:22] the lack of
[1:00:24] finances Sovereign Grace will produce
[1:00:27] Gyra Sovereign Grace will produce
[1:00:30] abundance because that's how the kingdom
[1:00:32] is a kingdom of life is an abundant life
[1:00:35] is a fruitful life
[1:00:39] amen gyro will step in and produce the
[1:00:42] Overflow in that time of lack yes amen
[1:00:46] praise the
[1:00:49] Lord want to drive this point one more
[1:00:52] time to show you the prophet is not
[1:00:53] playing when he's teaching this he says
[1:00:55] I don't know why but something happened
[1:00:57] always when a healing takes place or
[1:00:59] anything there something
[1:01:02] happens I'm trying to show this Prophet
[1:01:04] was not operating by faith
[1:01:06] alone he was operating out of love which
[1:01:08] produces
[1:01:12] Faith a love comes in and it just takes
[1:01:17] everything else out the way you see when
[1:01:19] they say now what a mighty prophet of
[1:01:21] God this was he was operating in faith
[1:01:25] the bride says yes yes but there was a
[1:01:27] power behind
[1:01:29] it there was a force behind
[1:01:32] it and this is what Ben him won't know
[1:01:37] about this is
[1:01:39] what not wasin bolt what's this other
[1:01:42] guy's name Uber Angel you want talk
[1:01:46] about this
[1:01:47] key Uber Angel these men who study the
[1:01:51] prophet's life and
[1:01:53] Ministry you'll hear them talk about his
[1:01:56] Faith but the bride is talking about the
[1:01:58] substance that produced that Faith
[1:02:01] hallelujah amen
[1:02:04] yes thank you amen he says now look we
[1:02:08] know he was the mightiest Prophet we
[1:02:11] know he's operating in Realms of healing
[1:02:12] that was unseen to this world even now
[1:02:15] they are baffled by
[1:02:18] it yeah what he saying I'm going to read
[1:02:20] it again he says I don't know why but
[1:02:22] something always when a healing takes
[1:02:24] place or anything
[1:02:26] there's something happens a love comes
[1:02:29] in and it just takes everything else out
[1:02:32] the way and I tell you Brethren you can
[1:02:34] have all the theology you have but give
[1:02:36] me love every
[1:02:39] time you can have all the seals you want
[1:02:41] seals standers V trumpet but give me
[1:02:45] love
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:49] a I tell you we got to fight we've got
[1:02:52] the most powerful weapon the devil makes
[1:02:54] fun of it and says there's no such a
[1:02:56] thing you see why he says there's no
[1:02:57] such a thing he can't impersonate
[1:03:00] it right but pick up tonight and receive
[1:03:03] the Holy Ghost and defeat every
[1:03:05] devil of sin drunkenness whatever it is
[1:03:08] we got him on the run to be conquered
[1:03:11] you see right now the devil hates what
[1:03:12] I'm teaching you I'm teaching you the
[1:03:15] Conquering Force yes Lord thank you the
[1:03:18] devil maybe even rejoicing when we
[1:03:20] trying to build your faith but now we
[1:03:22] teaching you the driving force Bey the
[1:03:24] faith amen
[1:03:26] amen and brother this is God's word
[1:03:29] which is sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:03:31] it's the greatest power that is ever put
[1:03:33] in the hands of man and God's expecting
[1:03:35] I'm closing now right God is expecting
[1:03:38] Adam's race is anyone here part of
[1:03:41] Adam's
[1:03:43] race to put sin sickness and all kinds
[1:03:46] of devil to the fighting walls that's
[1:03:50] right we've got the most powerful weapon
[1:03:51] there is Arnold F vinkle ra left them
[1:03:56] sticks and stones but God left us his
[1:03:58] word and his Spirit let's stand for
[1:04:00] Christ let's stand for the word let's
[1:04:02] pull the sword out of the sheep and
[1:04:04] fight
[1:04:06] amen he says this is my last quote now
[1:04:10] Brethren we've draw little Circles of
[1:04:11] laws and different things and we've
[1:04:13] still never come to the real
[1:04:16] kernel oh this mystery this mystery this
[1:04:19] mystery we never came to the
[1:04:21] colonel it's Jesus Christ the love of
[1:04:24] God hallelujah didn't he say what was
[1:04:26] him seals about didn't he say it was
[1:04:30] Christ it was revealing
[1:04:33] Christ it's Jesus Christ the love of God
[1:04:36] that God wants us to see what a Pity
[1:04:38] love is the greatest most powerful
[1:04:41] weapon that this world has ever seen or
[1:04:43] know of it's a Dying For Love yes the
[1:04:47] church is perishing for love the real
[1:04:50] love of God Waters of Grace to flow one
[1:04:53] to another when confidence is restored
[1:04:56] when Justice is restored between us the
[1:04:58] love of God that's shed abroad in our
[1:05:00] hearts by the Holy Spirit God's love to
[1:05:05] us so with that I'm going to close and
[1:05:07] say this is the
[1:05:10] secret behind coming back to all that
[1:05:14] Adam
[1:05:15] lost faith operating through
[1:05:18] love yes you must speak to mountains but
[1:05:21] there's a driving force behind your
[1:05:24] faith it's the greatest of
[1:05:27] three and now remember what we've been
[1:05:30] saying all this time not it's not three
