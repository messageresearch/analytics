believe all the believers [Music] appreciated a tenant in the church Amen sister Church there was not one that was demanding required much attention amen she's loved coming to church loved being in the presence of the Lord a man not you know somebody who's overly demanding and wanting attention all the time but she was a woman of great faith no matter the trial the situation and the struggle she went through and the sicknesses she was always one who requested prayer and she always said I know my God will heal me amen and she was she we know she's a time-tested memorial she stood the test of time maybe we went through many trials with the family and you know losing a husband at a pretty young age and then having to take care of the rest of the children and raising up in the ways of the law but a burden has always been that our children serve the Lord amen and I believe that maybe he said somehow God can still have grace and mercy and still the desire for heart amen so we certainly gonna miss her in this fellowship Amen see a cheerful bubbly smile every time she come into the answer the Lord Amen so we just wanted to honor her this morning and say Amen and because we never had that opportunity with all of you here so we just want you to remember her and honor her this morning amen so we know that we're getting on in age some of us as you can see in the lockdown I went like give me great [Music] a man good to see pastor Shane and his wife here this morning let's welcome them he asked the Lord amen amen we remember the time you know we're growing up in church and we remember all these faithful people we see sister Gandhi sitting here a man they probably knows from the type of little boys growing up in the church and now we see amen we come into a time where you know it's the transition of life we transition from this dimension to the next dimension and then we see little ones coming up amen new generation coming up but we pray amen that the Lord has been our strength the Lord has been our portion amen and if we know that amen the Christian doesn't die we just change a dimension amen so let's stand together even as we get ready to hear the word of the Lord this morning [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] even so Jesus even commenting [Music] Oh Jesus [Music] let's sing it out if you worship me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is really of all trades I had to say by heart even if they mention it regarding a sister ship many of us without even privileged to go to the field gather and things like that so the bathroom respect you just gonna have a moment of silence and I believe is she's looking down you know someone with the grace of God she's looking down and and should be rejoicing with the Saints they're saying you know what I would have eating chat this morning she was yeah she's looking down and you know very grateful so just to observe a moment of silence and also sister Gandhi one of her sisters passed away she had was the cancer the amputated Elaine Hogan failure and she passed away and and the same thing they was they had a rushed funeral they didn't even allow them to have a proper funeral just a very very shot that was enough and our sister said yes half an hour only and there you know not many people could so just as a mark of respect they just bow her head and just remember that sorry Joshua's brother also Jonathan passed away and the praying and trusting but we thank God we got a testimony day Amen that he believed and he received and was wanting to get baptized and the other miracle day we can say that Joshua was preparing to pool to baptize him so does he come out of hospital but his other brother what's his name Samuel he saw the light and that we were having the service on the house there that Friday and he got touched to there whatever was said and he got baptized in the pool instead of his brother raised alone so we just sort of remember them the mark of respect this bow head for few minutes amen praise the Lord I'm sure they appreciate that you know the Prophet did that it was a sister by the name of Dell sister Belle that you can be seated I want you to get tired there was a sister by the name of Dell colored system was fellowshipping there and he passed away and there was something strange happened there because then the prophet got the call to pray for the system that's not well and serious in hospital the gamer they gave another name and then you knew that suspend then they were actually praying for for the sister which they gave the name mineral it wasn't that sister it was sister Belle Kali sister was in hospital and she passed away and then the Prophet found out later after that that they gave the wrong name and he made a statement he says you know it may be the will of the Lord because it was the hand of the Lord upon her and God didn't want them to pray for her it was time for her to go home so it was something that he actually mentions it see and then he says as a mark of respect let's stand up and remember sister Belle so we praise God for that and we know that according to the word we are going to see them again all those are passed on we know we're going to see them again as we always pray about it you know that God will make a way for us and there I had opposed to the quote this morning I posted quite a few but there was one talking about the token and the word and things like that and I just picked up this trick again and I just read I says yeah one gone one missing yet those of you want one less if you wonder snakes is played here with it to give up and things like that listen carefully now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of big baptized with the Holy Ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the hedge it would she lives there's a lot the true evidence is to receive the word in the hedge that he look so let me show you this most clearly so it goes on talking about the church edges there and and now there's gonna be people so we thank God for that see that he has revealed is things to us and and we can believe it see not everybody can believe this word the message for the Aged they reject it it has been rejected the messenger has been rejected the message has been rejected but there's a previous maybe bride or receiver that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost I was about I said when he is come he will teach us all things I was going to teach it he's Holy Spirit so how he's going to teach by the way he has ordained and we thank God we have one prophet messenger for the aged as he states here that's for the aged that brings a word of God and then it is given out to all the people I'd be glad see a true revelation that we have received this word is the evidence of the Holy Ghost can anybody else show us any other evidence he says it's not speaking in tongue and not shouting not jumping and always think say so the true evidence is to receive the word for the Aged and we glad for that praise Lord and we glad to be gathered after so long you know they got all these laws and and regulations that you must do this and you can't do that then and if you really look at it it was a foretaste of what's going to happen in the tribulation one of the main thing is people can't by himself now look at it yet that it's around the world people were not able to by himself companies were closed down people were forbidden to run the businesses so it's going to happen like that in the tribulation if they don't take the system the mark the deeds right and the teachings if they don't take it then they are doomed so by pressure everybody's going to take it but the bride will be gone see somewhat thank God for that that you know yes it's told us they'll take them up so this is a foretaste exactly what's gonna happen see and the monitoring people and doing this and doing that and everything else exactly what's going to happen persecution is going to come it's actually a foretaste isn't when they were dictating now we adorn bail we have to obey so when they're gonna come there and then you'll see some of these things in you know left behind those movies and all maybe other people are going to be treated praise the Lord so this is actually a foretaste of everything the money system business economics everything sanctions are being applied amongst Nations right now all these are going to happen yendo in the world and now also another problem preachers in the seals there we the true people that bribe will be forbidden to preach will be forbidden to preach you can't go in the streets and preach and teach a note you must have a license and where you're gonna get the license they must give you the license you must come under the system and you got a license so right now we were forbidden to preach and all this thing and if they stopped us preaches on the road and you tell them I'm a preacher or pastor they'll ask you for your license what are you gonna do that you got no license they say show us proof see and we find these denominations I've got some of them got licensed preachers and this is a foretaste of all what's going to happen in the tribulation so we thank God that he has shown as this thing now some time believers don't want to listen and then realize you know what these things are true when it's preached and breathing it all this has happened you'd better get a wake up listen to the message the world is following apart again the profit bridge in 1960 all that is taking place now rich in 1960 look at the writing man and all the chaos because one policeman kills a man of that of the flow they the whole work is in Oprah England everywhere all these things we have a promise very been believed that we thank God that we have a promise so just remember somebody does not work rather setting stuff up yesterday and you said you wouldn't break this I believe yeah now with this condition how mean over 20 years he had a bypass also and he's going to go through this you know this correctly in obviously so disparate and also system victory is not well I think they mentioned something about the lung program or something and also she's had a new great-granddaughter so I think you must have seen the curriculum and many of them I was not expecting to see brother rod here because he was supposed to get a little blue and study all fellowship that all the road and quite see so we take what we can come in there and there will be a name change okay watch the shame I've listened to the one that have Thursday Wednesday or Friday right in fact this is really one Friday and he goes not well you did go sometime back for prospect treatment and everyone again so Monday I think he was not mobile it was a bit a couple of days so so so so so see we're living in such a time this clamped up believers can gather see and then I decided to go the persecution in China India Pakistan this believers right now china i imprisoned for being Christians correct see there must go to the state recognized church that is established the country any other Church having services and over no they be they rested safe so this believe is inclusive right now while we are freedom justice thank God then we pray that so once again together destination better should be home in the mystical body Jesus Christ I haven't much to you I I was preparing something in this I brought about three things here this morning but I want to speak about the rapture was the same but before we go into all these I just want to beat your attention in this great dividing lines of how the Superman is being brought to our admission through the Holy Spirit we see that there is a diversity that is going on the message lines but they feel but between the lines to the supernatural that was so so as we have gathered together in this great fashion on this side of eternity amen you have for Dean and people amen that would be called by your name that would be a both father through the influence of your spirit amen Lord just to be that portion of that word choice Oh God yes we did nothing father but you are telling all for us when we realize the simplicity in which you have called us yeah and let me look back in our years life there was nothing good about us hey babe but father greet ya [Music] all the time give to your children the undivided attention they will be superimposed power my god to em across there even as we change you now I just want to read you some culture and then going to go into the word of the Lord oh yeah people brother branham tells us here in the exposition of the summer Church ages for the jump in church age he brings this remarkable and profound statement and he said here oneness of the gut it is all the way from Genesis 1:1 in the revelation 22:20 way below but the people have been blinded by an unscripted and structural dogma of a Trinity and then dogma is so universally accepted that you try to see a one-goal person is all but in if people can't see the truth of the garden but fight it they can't see they can't ever see the rest of the truth because the revelation is Jesus Christ his church and his works in the midst of the church for the seventh agency do you get that now I am sure you understand then he says goes on the exposition of the seven churches the revelation of Jesus Christ he brings this and he brings it to our admonition hey Beth I admit that it takes a river and real revelation from the Holy Ghost to see the truth about we are ever in the midst of the perverting of so much scripture but the prevailing overcoming Church is both a revelation so we can expect God to reveal his you actually don't need a revelation on what about this ahead it is right there staring in your face you write an exposition gotta say the United time in sight yit what a time that we are living this great mystery of God being finished but bringing in the garden showing where it is how these little isms and went off and made him this and somebody made him this and somebody made in that but the angel of the Lord come down and brought up all the isms and pull out the truth out of it and presented it and there is just as perfect as it can be no other way you could go there it is that one he is see the Serpent's eat all these different things that's been so mysterious mysteriously amongst the people see what it is what is it this is the sign to what the greatest Atmos vision the greatest of all revelation is the deity the supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you can't get to first base and kill you believe that you walk out that's what be the same thing and then see the deity be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and then you are ready to go in the spirit hey we need to get in the spirit amen the first thing you have to know is the deity of Christ I am the Alpha and the Omega I am from a there's no more but I was at the beginning I will be at the end I am he that was which is and shall come the Almighty think of it that's what so great you just all these quotes were not here for admission a mornin we end the message years now brother Branham was our prophet whatever he needed to bring is broken right and when he is brought out this great revelation of the message of the hour he brought it to a prophetic ministry and also the seventh the fivefold ministry in the scripture the faithful ministry in the Sturgis is world-renowned Tibet but it will have the same only got to motivate those things that you need to know there won't be a conflict of Scripture there won't be a conflict of disability that Minister whatever because their very life that comes with what you believe will edit your minds a man plays no more so we looked at our speaker this morning the festive solonius for verses 16 and I was subject this morning is not sure what the seven see the Lord for the Lord Himself was 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God the dead in Christ shall rise first so let me with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so when we are this is here then okay and so shall we ever be with the stinky wherefore comfort one another [Music] Revelation chapter 8 and the relationship that we need so much maybe take it on so much and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of in Revelation 7:1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed and we understand now that the prophecy was fulfilled right by the following scripture in Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord even the coronavirus can't stop it and he shall tell the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to the father's it doesn't smite the earth with a curse our heart says be changed x3 22 for Moses truly said unto the father's a prophet shall the role of a God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall you hear in all things whatsoever ye shall say unto you behold I will send you Elijah listen to you listen to the spirit of Elijah but you're making mistake and shall come to pass then every soul which will not hear that prophet he shall be destroyed from among even that's sunny be in the day with the Sun man to many of us we have a tendency a tendency of understanding okay that the second series over the sevens here we know everything about it is open and it's all eternity but we don't see the progression of the showmanship the poison the Champa we don't see the progression so the revelation in progression is happening in the blood of Jesus Christ with the understandable supernatural experience by a word by word prophetic ministry to change the hearts and being changed it will be changing from the inside so we need to see the change now you want to savor it posture posture change you come from all the way from stanga you're seeing this and you're seeing that why these you know change what is notice there's no that there is you don't see and I was thinking about it what the very same instant why could you seen happen whatever is no results I failed you see that there was a business I'm fated to see that there was another believer there are cancer that kami and he was shuffling king edward's thank you this way doctor a chemo this way that way but just one prayer over a telephone and these signs shall follow those that believe if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover this is a good show it is more appreciated understood the test of time I'm sure I could it's 1963 the Prophet William Branham preached a message entitled Christ is the mystery of God it was preached in Jeffersonville Indiana some five months after brother Branham experience with the giant crowd on Sunset Mountain in February of that same year okay are you with me so in the month of March 17th to 24th he preached the revelation of the seventh seal but some of you got the book it's still in the Shelf some of you not reading some of you not reading the church each book or what you are busy in this lockdown is in the kitchen cooking eating cooking eating no spiritual guidance sorry we need something we need something to go up there we need to feel we need the supernatural feel we are supernatural astronaut we cannot stand down in this time of this rotation H we are out of this layer Basin H we are young mark for the lecture so therefore we are here together to invite lies in the messages take detective messages to influence the rustling fate in your life so that you will be boosted by the holy spirit to know the things of God and what you need lately giving to him of your undivided attention now he goes on to say it is one of his anonymous messages and it has to do with a great mystery that been hidden under the seventh if study with an open mind and with prayer the obedient ones will be given the revelation contained in the powerful self you give with me if the Seventh Seal was open what mystery beautiful messages let's continue pray and move on the purpose subject in this sermon is one of the most remarkable events events in all of history it is next in importance to the first coming of Jesus Christ and to the Future rapture when we come to a point of memory here and I John the Baptist for and the first coming of the Lord you were four and his second coming come on now so all these things were done not for to show we know okay you Saints here every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh our fresh as well as in the flesh of the Virgin child is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not a god I wanna check it out as we attempt to enter into the meaning of the scripture of first John four to three remember that we are looking at the meaning of his great seven men and the mystery has been hiding for the mystery has to do with Christ in the flesh of a prophet for us but then in the fresh of every other bright member a mana church you know are important you are here now he's right there inside of you hallelujah that's right word made for my neighbor a man the richest God not to say for the mystery has to do with Christ in the flesh first then in the flesh every other pride member the riches of the glory of this mystery that is now being revealed to how a Gentile is Christ in us so Christ in us the way we're up today the way we conduct ourselves today in the every walk in life he chose us what type of spirit is governing us as human beings we all make mistakes I make mistakes but this message has got nothing to do mistakes even this message was 14 Satan to kill upon our mistakes I am God's property I am God's seventh year in the one that God has 14 before the foundation of the world I am the one that will return what about bringing the world into the I can do all things through Christ Jesus forget the dividing lines that's what Satan will do to try and distract your mind he may distract your human mind but he will never ever distract your supernatural members because the blood is shed when the supernatural comes in that is the mind of Christ so we have the mind of the message Christ is a mystery of God reveal whether the Brandon used Colossians 1:15 g29 has his text when reading the scriptures and coming to the 26th verse he said now I want to read that then he repeated it in Colossians 1 1 to traditions giving the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to recent then he said I want to title this is the mystery of God so don't we have a tendency of thinking that we are famous every failure is a stepping stone to success because the footsteps of the righteous and the devil cannot come and use his footsteps and take your restraint hello he will try and try and try and try and try he can try he will fail Jesus Christ is the mystery of God maybe rejection he says now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the third part of God's mind there was something that he was trying you gotta be breathing that he was trying and was great to achieve he was trying and he had a motive in doing it okay in order to let himself be expressed we look at the concept of Michelangelo right you get a time emerges that for sculpting came up there [Music] he did that until he came to its perfection and everything was that image the great image was so identical but the only thing that did not happen was it could did you say now he was trying to have this in other words he was trying to make you into the perfect image of Christ and the only way that he could help you in the perfect image is for you to be in the mind of God before the foundation of so therefore he was trying to exorcise the terrestial to celestia you come into a great connection that you are connected to the maker in them so that you will have peace that passes all human understanding and your power and spirit the goats would Elijah will be the spirit that God has set you follow me then he goes on to say here now he says now God had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what I want to speak unto the church this money the hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how its unfolded itself amen right down to this present hour and then you will understand clearly what is being done God's great mystery of how is he taught me the secret nobody knows nothing about it nobody knows nothing about but somebody afternoon a 324 of the churches with what was intercepted no one knows like we need to know nobody knows nothing about giving the Angels didn't understand it they just wouldn't understand David a right they ready he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery the seventh year when the seven she was opened there was silence in the please no with me in this hole that was that he said when the sea was open there was it will be very important to us [Music] something to germinate within ourself and bringing in glory is a spirit I hope different unit different everything is different but there is a spirit white spirits we are baptized in the body white spirit in a mystical body there's no difference amen so that's one spirit that we have you have desperate I am Jesus when he wasn't they wanted to know when you would come and he said it's not even given the Sun himself don't know when it's free to happen it has been questioned question and answers answers that time today it should ask in the same question in the messages right what them was a mystery that was shown in every type in the Bible it was Christ come down in flesh in the body form of his prospect okay and ministering to his people in our age it was Jesus Christ back on earth in the prophet of Malachi 4:5 they were meant to prepare the hearts of the bride for the rapture in the following code the Prophet will tell us again the God's great mystery is Christ has been revealed that his greatcoat has been accomplished and that all the acts of the believers in the Bible expressed what God's grow was but he said God has revealed it to me saying God revealed the mystery under the Seventh Seal me to him so God reveal the seventh seal to him then the seventh seal is already revealed to us [Music] [Music] [Music] because on to say page 17 therefore the entire Bible is a revelation of God's mystery in class the entire Bible is the expression of one goal that God had one purpose we wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been in tight and expressing what God Graco is and will be judged and now in the last day he has rebuilding and shows us and and God's help will see it right here this morning what the Lord had in his mind although and that's explicitly depo you can see the great meaning on what it be to know this and then try to bring it to the people able to the five minutes the posture he will come you'll be under the anointing crying out sign the abomination looking up know what's good for them what you need for them to go using petrol yes use Christ's power quality but yeah I believe in the Holy Ghost me that's my sign I believe in the Holy code that's my advocate I believe in the Holy Ghost amen see the manifestation moving in my life in your life why would eat good food you're eating you mmm so therefore your stops ready stop chunky mmm stop doing this stop doing that respect your husband let's Peck your wife respect your children respect all that clan system mystery no listen coach because now I ain't going to even pay attention what the clock says I want you to get this so you can see here basically in the beginning they very thought that God had is mine we need it from all those scholars and that's just a number as little predestinated number of people [Music] but all these things God is filtering through his precious wood and picking man spotter for a holy monster he's bringing about people that will be subjected under the influence of the Holy Ghost in this great time of understand now the coming of the Lord is a mystery is it mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's come see so we show what all the mysteries of God waiting for this last day at least already been completed then he reveals he shows what he's done oh oh my never give his mystery info he ends the code then we look at the flesh on sunset expression who was it coming up toward in this spirit in the world come into a profit was it coming welcome that is not being recognized by the world today but only Electric amen they are the only ones that will see now with this Jesus scripture has been fulfilled then what they will do they will rush your Redemption draweth da so you will do something to quicken that spirit inside of you out of this Laodicean second chances to move to the question what coming are you speaking up prophet of God it's very very important that we understand he was not talking about the lecture coming notice in the statement just about that he said after the coming has already been completed then he'll reveal you shoot what is done the rapture is that future but sunset mountain was this friend a man I saw understand supernatural be big big manifesting front of us ever prophetic ministry faithful ministry coming all these things are blending amen to cherish so that we could rejoice and say Lord I am feeling so good the reason that was such a tremendous thing then he spoke of it here and showed these seven thunders and looking like my life magazine day carried that circle of cloud and like there that they could not understand and don't know it yet me what you telling me go there and wait for these mysteries to be revealed able months before it happened and then it happened exactly the way so now you see how easily we could fall astray so the Lord is the future event according to testimonies 416 when he comes the dead in Christ rise but we will see them will rejoice though that a light will be caught up to meet him in the air and then we are gone so what's your question what's the big hoorah here did everybody if you keep this way to beat that 2000 nucleus up and take the imaginary thought and bring it with the supernatural talking that it is no longer a debt limit
