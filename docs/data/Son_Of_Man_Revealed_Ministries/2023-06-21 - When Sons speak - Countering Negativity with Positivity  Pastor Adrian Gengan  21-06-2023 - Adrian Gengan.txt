Christ our prayer in Jesus name amen amen agreed every one of you in the Blessed name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen good to see every one of you amen good job brother Ramesh back hallelujah amen we certainly missed him I was telling you missed him in church I almost missed him again today but amen praise the Lord that he gives us a victory over every circumstance amen hallelujah let's turn to our Bibles Hebrews chapter 11 amen just keep a few Believers that were mentioned in prayer even uh araly amen and Zion amen Hallelujah pray the question for the same schools Pizza amen they request we pray for her as well I believe she's in hospital again with water in her lungs immense will be requested prayer amen listen to Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1. this would be the name of the Lord amen says here now Faith is the substance of things hoped for amen amen amen so faith is true is there you can find it if you define it faith is a substance one of things hopeful and two the evidence of Things Not Seen amen then we'll go to Second Corinthians 4 18. it says so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen amen we fix our eyes not on what is seen But on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal amen and then second Corinthians chapter 10 reading from verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not walk after the flesh Amen in this life we walk in the flesh but we do not walk after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and this is the verse we want to focus on casting down imaginations and every eye thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ but that's my focus there bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ how we think will determine the way we live in this life amen so we are bringing into captivity every thought is it saying only the spiritual thoughts every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled amen may be seated the Lord blessings to the reading of his word amen Hallelujah amen for a subject I want to speak on when Sons speak and for title I want to say countering negativity with positivity amen countering negativity with positivity amen amen amen what are we doing in this amen because being a teaching lesson and it's a witness in that Bible study and a prayer meeting hmm and if we were walking this way then sons of God speak a certain way we don't see things the way the world sees things we don't see things the way the normal Christians see things we are not normal Christians amen we are sons of God back in the image and after his likeness amen so we speak differently we speak like God we think like God didn't the Lord say my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts amen but now that he's brought us join tears with Jesus Christ we ought to be thinking like Jesus thought speaking like Jesus spoke acting like Jesus acted amen hallelujah so we read here and he says though we walk in the flesh we do not war up to the flesh so we are Waging War against the flesh that's the first battle we got there amen is to wage war against the flesh to bring the flesh man and the subjection amen amen and it says for the weapons of our Warfare not carnal But Mighty through God the pulling down of strongholds meaning we have divine power to destroy strongholds amen through the power of the Holy Spirit we have divine power to destroy struggles there's not a situation you and I should be able to walk in where we leave that place and we are not Victorious amen amen if there's a demon there the demon must leave if there's a sick person there they must be healed amen amen we should walk with such confidence amen we are not at baby church amen come on now amen every situation we encounter did Jesus leave every situation that he was in for the good or better when he came in the presence of sick did he leave them sick or did he heal them amen hallelujah amen when he didn't have means to of a boat to get to the ship where the disciples were did that stop him he began to walk on the water amen amen when he was asleep on the boat and the winds and the waves were raging and Satan was trying to cause his stuff did he allow that storm you were sleeping the disciples woke him up if they didn't wake him up he would have slept through the storm because he was the master of the storm yes amen and then he spoke to the stone yes amen now very very strange but let's just go through the scripture then we'll talk more casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ now if that thought is a positive thought and it's a faithful thought then do we need to bring it into obedience no right so then that thought must be a negative thought yeah if we have to bring a thought into captivity it must be a negative thought it must be a thought against the word amen so we have to bring even our own speech in alignment with what God's word says you know Jesus encountered every uh attack of the enemy every Temptation Of The Enemy by saying it is written I'm going to give you a common example now when we go to a doctor and the doctor diagnoses the case and cancer of high blood pressure sugar diabetes maybe even heart disease whatever what does a doctor do does he write now you're walking and you're confronted with it is written but there's two it is written there's what the doctor wrote and then it's what God word wrote God word wrote and says by his stripes you were healed amen healing is the children's bread amen amen but the human mind is so conditioned and negativity sets in and you know that even right now you you may be seated here but if your mind is wandering you're not here really yes yes you could be physically in your flesh body but if you could probably be in your kitchen right now that's how powerful your mind is amen Hallelujah some of you guys were in love no you constantly with your girlfriend no matter where you are you thinking of now the Bible says think on these things that are lovely that are pure amen we got to think on the things of the Lord amen so we are we are we have two things that we said now we got the doctor's report it is written you have this and God's word says you do not have it what do you read in second Corinthians 4 18 we fix our eyes not on what is seen we don't look to the symptoms but what is unseen so faith is speaking what you want and not what you see yes yes amen Abraham call those things that are not as though they were yes yes amen now we are Spirit sons of God Amen born son Spirit sons that when we speak our word is backed amen why is our word bad because we are in the image and after his likeness amen we can't help but speak faith amen now sometimes it goes through training training is bringing you up in the sonship now we can try and please many people in this life but you've got to please the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to remind you of a story now this young man he either was a piano player but some music thing he was doing I think he was a violent play or maybe a music player and he was having this great big audition and he played and after he played everybody was cheering he was getting a standing ovation but his eyes was not fixed on them amen his eyes was not fixed on the standing ovation and the hundreds of people that were standing and applauding him his eyes was fixed up to the balcony and he was looking for the approval of one person his teacher the one who taught him and when he looked up his eyes was fixed on him and when he got the Master's approval amen then he was satisfied in his heart then he took a bow amen Hallelujah so we have got to be fixed from pleasing the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen so what am I saying that sometimes in life people may want us to go along with their negativity to go along with their way of life now even scientists testifying that negativity will bring diseases and illness amen and people think that the reasons for the entire body of prolonged eggs have nothing to do with their negative thoughts but even science is saying that if you're constantly negative it has an effect on the body so then the mind that can bring sicknesses upon your body yes you know there's something about Job the prophet says that his faith would have brought him through it and he showed him that not have been destroyed by these negative thoughts brought you to it he was constantly troubled about his children you read that in perfect Faith the prophet will tell you that amen so when someone is a pessimist if someone is in amen constantly negative it has an effect on emotional health amen doctors have found the people with high levels of negativity are more likely to suffer from degenerative brain diseases cardiovascular problems digestive issues recover from sickness much slower than those with a positive mindset now you can't get more positive than the word of God because Faith cometh by the hearing of the word of God amen hallelujah so we have got to commit ourselves to the word and prayer amen we must know the word of God we've got to read the word of God amen then the spirit comes and takes that word and quickens it and when we need that word we can take that word which is building faith in our heart and applying that word amen otherwise if I if if we are not filled with the word of God when we are facing a trouble a circumstance we have nothing in our God no ammunition amen our sword is blood amen so yeah I am reading now from science negative emotions stop us from thinking and behaving rationally and seeing situations in a true perspective when this occurs we tend to see only what we see and remember only what we want to remember you see many times Christians get caught up in this the only concerned about that sickness the illness the lack of finances their trouble they only see what they want to see and they forget the word of God you forget the promises of God that's not walking in sonship that's not walking in authority amen we have got to constantly clothe ourselves with the word of God Amen I'm gonna ask you again do you read your Bible daily amen amen make it there make it a lifestyle to read your Bible and don't just read a verse try and read a chapter in the morning try and read a chapter in the evening amen amen if you get a chance during the day read a chapter yes amen peel yourself on the things of God amen now I'm asking you again how many of you are reading the Bible you say oh now this is for those that really are doing it I know as most people don't even listen to the messages anymore The Prophet's messages but Sam only will listen to The Prophet's messages and they won't read the Bible but the prophet's message came to bring light upon the scripture amen you've got to know the word for yourself amen so we have got I'm saying it again we've got to commit ourselves to the world because when you pray doesn't the Bible says that even ourselves we don't know what to pray but the spirits makes groanings on our behalf what is the spirit doing there is nothing more powerful than bringing back the scripture to God Amen when we pray back his word yes what does it say I think it's Isaiah 55 and verse 11 it says that my word will not return void hey man but it will accomplish the purpose for which you to ascend amen I am telling you if you speak word if you speak a word of healing if you speak a word over your finances if you speak a word no matter what you're speaking if you're playing about faith stand there till it comes back amen the word will not return void amen amen we've got to train ourselves now come on if you're praying maybe you're left home and you prayed for your child who's unwell phone back in us because you're expecting to hear the positive results how's the baby now how's the baby now can't be every time you hear the cough every time you say Thank you Lord she's healed thank you Lord he's healed amen counter every negative thing with positivity bring every thought and opinions and captivity of the Holy Spirit amen hallelujah amen we've got to look past the sea in church amen there's a whole Supernatural World out here amen hallelujah when and amen and kept around by a host of angels amen we can't be walking ignorance of these things not in this time not in this season not in this hour amen hallelujah amen it's yeah he says amen negativity sends our body into stress and you know something called fight or flight mode our body is designed to deal with stressful situations by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream making you more alert and focused though some stress is good for us too much can be detrimental for our health and extended periods of negativity slows down digestion and decreases the immune system's ability to fight inflammation that is also why negative people are more likely to get more sick than Optimus now that is a study done at University it's not even the prophet if human study is telling you what negativity can do to your body amen hallelujah you find sometimes we take certain things and we we think that it's just normal things headaches chest pain fatigue upset stomach sleep problems insomnia anxiety depression social withdrawal drastic changes in your metabolism all of these things are because of the effect of negativity yeah amen I'm sick I got this I got that you're speaking negativity upon your body amen we we spoke this already that prolonged negativity hurts your mental health amen making individuals more likely to turn to smoking substance abuse as a way of coping amen now in the same way negative thoughts create neutral Pathways in the brain positive self-talk and reinforcement can also become a habit now when I'm saying positive talk I'm not talking about worldly positive talk I am talking about applying the word there's nothing more positive than the word amen happiness joy amen being optimistic and let the word influence us amen now in the midst of your problem I want you to be able to practice this in the midst of your trial don't panic today you may say all is well why are you preaching this tomorrow all may not be well for you but still your confession must be all is well amen if you hear somebody say it's bad say it's good if you see somebody just say it's a it's a child that's misbehaving say thank you Lord and thank you for the good behavior don't speak the negative yes amen amen you say oh brother what are you trying to do I am trying to make you change the way you speak because life and death lay in the power of the what is life positive death is negative amen amen let's extend their thought Mark 11 23. 22 he goes to a fig tree right that trigger life but the mountain there's a mountain of life come on now that's the mountain of life there's no life in the mountain [Music] so what did Jesus say did he speak to the Fig Tree which had life and the mountain which which is dead so there's life and death who is the resurrection and the life who has power over the over living things and dead things what is he saying there you can speak to living things and it will obey you and you can speak to dead things and it will obey you man yeah yeah I also got it today don't worry Jesus is telling us as Sons you can speak to living both the living things and the dead things dead things must come back to life and Obey you yes and even living things if they are living growths cancer negative thoughts you can curse it it'll die to the roots we just look at the fig tree you bring your thoughts on the Captivity we let it die at the roots now we're not talking about this I want you to be so conscious of it that even in your own homes when you start to communicate start to change the way we think and if the families can just be sensitive to this and don't take offense when the wife says but let's not speak negative or the husband says let's not speak negative amen what are we doing reconditioning the way we speak as Sons and Daughters of God amen now do you know there's another form of negativity which is subtle and comes into US is that is speaking bad about others how many of you know every time you speak bad of others it just brings a joy in the house such it's exuberant joy that everyone's rejoicing or does it create a spirit a negative attitude that now you're also fast and you sing you're so angry with that person too and the person telling you that you're listening to that story you also become angry because that's your friend and you want to be angry for your friend now you can do it physically or you can do it on the telephone not one amen we can do it on the telephone every time you see this number you know complaints are coming hey and you enjoy listening to that thing now complain complain complain some of you need to go work at the airport thank you amen complain did you see this did you see that did you see this what did the Corinthians say I look at the Unseen not at the scene amen so when we come into a church environment even and you see something the prophet says pray for that but don't wait to go as soon as you get home phone now you saw this you saw this what did the Lord say why don't you take out the beam from your eye instead of trying to take out the mode from somebody else's heart amen hallelujah I'm trying to go slow I'm trying not to get amen I'm trying to bring it out clear so that everybody understands amen amen I'm also going very slow because you see the way Autumn is writing there's so much notes that she needs to catch up amen Hallelujah Give the Lord a good answer for praise amen thank you now when you see something that you're working on now remember you are working on your situation you're working on yourself now when God was working on the Earth and when he was creating did he say it was good when something when Moses was chipping away at this sculpture in his mind every day he would look and whenever he finished he would say it is good you can see it coming into he can see it coming into me to materialize into what's in his mind now there's a powerful thing there hold a picture of what you want in your mind shape it no no not just circumstances and things and material things yes you do that it'll work for you but how about you your image of the Son of God of you amen hold a positive image Lord I thank you Father I am in the Statue of a perfect man I'm in your image and I'm in your likeness and when I speak oh god father even the heavens obey Lord Jesus he said whatever bind on Earth is bound in heaven whatever loose on Earth he's loosed in heaven father amen amen glory be to his name amen amen so every time you're through working on something say it is good it is good amen when you're correcting someone son I don't like what you're doing amen but I see you amen maturing in Christ I see you coming into wisdom I see you coming into understanding speak positivity into that person amen don't say you you can end up a good for nothing person Speak Life amen Speak Life the only time you're allowed to speak negative against somebody is if they are rejecting the gospel that's the only time the gospel the in the Gospels it tells you that's your feet and walk away amen but here we have the time you do good you speak good now Jesus amen the Lord six times five times he said it was good and the sixth time he said it's very good so God has not changed is God working all things together in your life Now The God Who worked to create the heavens and the Earth after each thing he created he said it was good now he's still working on you and that's when the Bible says he makes all things work together for our good amen so you are still a work in progress and God is not finished with you so don't look at your life in a negative way don't get disappointed at your disappointments you are not the sculpture you are not the Potter you are just the clay yes so why do we get negative about our negativity why do we get negative about our thoughts and our failures the Lord didn't need say in his prayer we can come back to him and say Lord forgive me as I forgive those that don't worry you are that are filled with the Holy Spirit you watch how the holy spirit will start to make you change your very own nature you'll start to pray for your enemies you'll start to pray for people who hate you people who spoke against you you bless them and you'll say Lord even bless them Lord Jesus amen amen that's what the Holy Ghost does changing us molding us into the image of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah now that age-old hurt that age will burn that the person that hurts you and you never spoke to for years you got the Holy Ghost you can pick up the phone inform that person and say brother we have some unresolved issues amen but we are brothers in Christ amen amen I want to tell you that I'm praying for you and I love you that's what the holy spirit will do it brings reconciliation amen now these things are foreign these things we don't want to hear but we are bringing every thought captive the Holy Spirit knows how to bring your every thought capture amen even the ones that you're pushed down there in your secret compartment he knows how to bring you think you think you think in your mind what does the Bible say out of the abundance of where the mouth speaker it's there in your heart amen Hallelujah so awaken the God man in you awake in the sun and the thoughts of God in you and speak positive words amen speak Through The Eyes of Faith a never lets a negative word come out of your lips no matter how bad it is amen amen that's in the Bible says every word that rises up against you God shall condemn it yes now if God condemns you why are you accepting it I said this book that's the last time when God told Abraham sacrifice your son he spoke and he said I in the lad shall return amen when Goliath said amen is that so let's go to some what the prophet is saying and now amen hallelujah you love the prophet amen I don't know what we'll do without this prophet of God amen amen he's our Prophet yes amen amen hallelujah glory be to his name thank you amen hear what he says here now never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts don't entertain it man yes well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on Amen who's bringing negative thoughts the enemy Satan where's the greatest battle of fought [Music] through there don't let it Roose don't let it settle the prophet will go on to say don't let everybody in a stick root in your heart yes yes amen he says don't think sitting here in your wheelchair now he's bringing it down to sicknesses and things sitting here in your wheelchair that you're hopeless helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through and don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind but don't let it stop he says here some people say one day if you call a prayer line one day if God will speak don't think that kind of negative thought don't let it go through your mind make every word positive and every thought positive see it amen hallelujah I want to bring it down to a natural application here maybe something that maybe you'll relate to when you are seeing that 1 000 Grand on your payslip you must see an extra zero then you've got to see it when are we going to put Faith and bring it practical that's right amen you remember some of the quotes from the Japanese went through last week about that was it the chain that the prophet made move yes yes he brought it down to a practical level amen he says now now you remember when we come in for healing we come into a situation we need to Center the scriptures around that so if it's healing you need to Center your thoughts around healing yes yes he says I want every person in here to have this in your mind that as soon as your prayer begins to go for the sick every one of you is going to get up and walk out of this building well what did he say I want you to have this in your mind amen that as soon as the prayer begins yeah yes I'm gonna walk out of your heel where is it I want every person here to have this in your mind that as soon as prayer begins to go for the sick every one of you is going to get up and walk out of the building well don't have nothing else in your mind amen keep thinking on that if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things don't walk away till you see it that's walking as a son and daughter of God amen amen glory be to his name amen I think we need to put the screens back on Amen I don't want you to miss his quotes now so I'll just wait for the screens to come back on Amen glory be to his name they're coming back on it's coming how many of you enjoying this this quotes is it helping us amen hallelujah he says you cannot get anything from God with a negative thought he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him you see when you come to God he must reward you he rewards faith amen glory be to his name the problem of God tells us about Mary amen when he's talking about Mary he says Mary when the angel came to Mary and said behold the animate of the Lord she started rejoicing she was happy God had promised it she knows she was going to have a baby I believe I spoke something about it last night she didn't wait till she felt alive amen she didn't wait till she was positive she didn't wait till any visible sign she just believed what the angel said was the truth even if you get the people to believe you know that doesn't only apply to the prophet the prophet says I'm going to bring it down to you but I want to take the progression of thought now follow me he says if you don't believe the one that's preaching it if you don't have confidence in the one that's preaching it you'll never receive anything from God if you don't believe the one that God has sent how are you going to receive it lovely you take that even further because you also a son and daughter of God Amen you know God has made us all join Jesus with Christ amen do you know that you and I are equal in the eyes of God We're All Sons and Daughters amen so God don't look at us with partiality God looks at us according to our faith [Music] amen so we must believe what the angel said the angel told the prophet if you can get the people to believe you not even cancer will stand in your way and I'm saying to you tonight that if you can get the people to believe you amen amen because I'm believing that you are the word made flesh now amen you are the manifested word in this time in this season if you get the people to believe you not even cancer will stand in your way believe us now this amen amen the problem is there's two things I find one of them is love the other is sweet and they are sweethearts amen and when love gets married to Faith love always accompanies faith when you love God enough to know that he can't lie to you it'll create faith in there that'll make you believe his word and every word he said is positive truth and you accept it with an unadulterated faith that won't say no amen when Jesus says yes nobody can say no nothing can't say no it'll produce that's exactly what he said he would do deep calling to deep forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all their iniquities who healeth all of thy diseases amen glory be to his name just want to go through a few more quotes here amen just to see what the prophet is saying he says faith it's some direct positive act that you have what are we speaking about countering every negative thought with faith with positivity so he says faith is some direct positive act that you have faith is the only directed positive sense it's the Sixth Sense so your five cents is all negative he says faith is the only positive sense amen it's a sixth sense it's not guesswork amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so don't wait amen until you feel a certain way if you don't feel better if you have faith according to your faith say Lord be unto me be that to me according to Thy word Lord amen all seven seals are open all Mysteries are open we are the full revelation of the word nothing has been hit from you yes God has taken you to the bad part of his mind reveals him hidden Mystery Secrets there's nobody else who has the Hidden Mysteries like the Bride of Jesus Christ like you the sons and daughters have and he's bringing you to his image and his likeness and he's equipping you and building you up the world is producing faith in us amen and according to your faith so shall it be the circumstance you are in now is because of your faith the level of your thinking right now is because of your faith because you think a certain way amen so no matter how how you feel don't look at how you feel amen look at what God's word says amen if somebody is sick no matter how you feel you're healed anyhow no matter what you see you're healed anyhow you know it there's nothing you take it out of your heart no matter what you are trusting the Lord for see it believe you have received it amen now according to science they say it takes 21 days to break a bad habit yeah amen 21 days to break a bad habit so how many days how many weeks is that three weeks amen to break a bad habit and what is a season three months so you can't be sowing constantly why do you think people are in season after season season after season in the same struggle in the same cycle right if you are not sowing a countering the negativity how are you ever going to reap in hours how is the season going to change you've got to counter the negative season amen the problem God even says sometimes in the daytime sometimes it's a nighttime sometimes we go through a rough catches but in the rough patches so amen positive words of freedom turn that season around amen so no matter what you see it's a positive act right there if you can't have enough God you have what the prophet says now if you can't have faith enough for God to patch up this body to glorify him in how much more are you going to afraid to believe that God will take this whole mortal body and make immortality out of it to take it up that's direct Divine Healing he says it more simply in another way he says if you can't have faithful Divine Healing how are you gonna offer it to the rapture amen if you can't call your situation into obedience you know that everything we are is thoughts everything that we do our actions and everything is based on thoughts amen it's based on thoughts hallelujah amen I don't want to Cloud your mind with too many thoughts let's go back to second Corinthians 4 18 just to reaffirm now of scriptures so that you remember these things so we fix our eyes not on what is seen are you writing these scriptures down are you memorizing it amen I'd like everyone to carry notebooks and note these scriptures now remember the season that we are in now it's equipping you so these scriptures you must memorize it you must lay before you we fix our eyes not on what is seen But on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal right then I want to get to second Corinthians 10 and verse 5 casting down imaginations some people only imagine negative things some people only imagine imagine vain things some people only imagine wicked things some people only have worldly Desires in the imaginations so you got to cast down imaginations some people imagine that people don't like them do you know that luckily we don't have any here some people have mental battles that people don't like them you gotta cast down imaginations what is this High thing that the Bible is talking about you and every High thing that exalted itself doesn't it say we wrestle not against flesh and blood spiritual wickedness in where I places then the Bible says that every High thing will be brought down you see every High thing so Satan exalts his negative thoughts negative thinking every eye thing that is exalted what is the knowledge of God if it's not faith is the knowledge of God faith Revelation is faith what is faith is it a revelation so the knowledge of God is revelation so can you see the negativity and positivity there every I think the negative things that exalted itself against the Revelation the faith of God and bringing into captivity now you know what's captivity when you hold something captive what you doing brother Joshua if you're trying to capture a criminal captivity why do you how you capture them you make sure they are secured in handcuffs if this is a hunting term how do you bring something into captivity you bind them in Chains Satan is trying to hold you down in Chains of whatever thing it is now but you hold him in Chains it says you bring into captivity every thought it's in the Battleground every thought to what The Obedience of Christ what is The Obedience of Christ the word the mind of Christ you bring it back to the word and you make him bow down to the word what is he doing you're bringing the thought to The Obedience of the word you make that thought bow down there we sang the song bow your knee Jesus is coming every thought every principality must bow down to the word amen who is the word yes let's let me yes I am the word made flesh today amen so who must this High thing that exalted
