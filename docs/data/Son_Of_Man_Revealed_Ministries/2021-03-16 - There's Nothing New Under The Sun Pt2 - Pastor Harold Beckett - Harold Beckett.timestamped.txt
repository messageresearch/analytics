[0:00] and we can see all those patterns
[0:02] unfolding in the bible
[0:04] and now we are back in the evening time
[0:05] we are back at harvest time
[0:07] so all the bible now become end-time
[0:09] scriptures
[0:11] so there's nothing new under the sun
[0:13] what we see here today
[0:15] been played out in some form in some
[0:17] type and some shadow
[0:18] and we are not a shadow we are not
[0:20] attacked but we have the fulfillment of
[0:22] all the types
[0:23] and so we can see that everything around
[0:26] us our achievements our natural birth
[0:29] as a beginning and it has an end a
[0:32] trials has a beginning
[0:33] and it has the name of life you might
[0:35] say well i'm in a heavy trial
[0:37] but that trial has a beginning in a
[0:39] trial it has a beginning somewhere
[0:42] that it began and at the end of the day
[0:44] that tribe will come to an end
[0:46] it's like a vapor it's like a grass it
[0:49] has no enduring substance
[0:51] nothing that we go through in life is
[0:53] enjoying
[0:54] everything has a season of time and as
[0:57] the messenger said we have no
[0:59] continuing setting the clothing that you
[1:01] have beautiful
[1:02] beautiful dress it gets old beautiful
[1:05] home
[1:05] it gets our beautiful car it gets all
[1:08] whatever we have in this life
[1:10] nothing we can take with us because it
[1:12] is natural it is seen
[1:14] but the unseen is more real like what we
[1:16] can say
[1:17] and god already made the unseen world
[1:19] before we made the singing world
[1:21] and there's a theophany already waiting
[1:23] for you before you on the earth
[1:25] brother bannon was laying next to his
[1:27] second wife in a mortal body and he was
[1:29] talking to his first wife
[1:32] and he says quickening power took me to
[1:34] the other side i saw all of you over
[1:36] there
[1:36] so you can see there's a there's a real
[1:39] world this is only the scene world this
[1:41] is younger world that we see
[1:43] we see the buildings we see grass we see
[1:45] eels we see atms
[1:47] we see all those things around us but
[1:49] the unseen is more real what we can see
[1:52] and so everything is mixed it's got joy
[1:55] it's got sadness sometimes you're very
[1:57] happy and sometimes sadness comes in
[1:59] your home
[2:00] sometimes there's a little baby being
[2:02] born you're happy
[2:03] new life has come in a home sometimes
[2:06] there's death in your home and you
[2:07] become very sad
[2:09] and life and this life is that life it's
[2:11] got death
[2:12] and it has ups and it's downs he has
[2:15] mountains and valleys
[2:16] it has health and he has sickness
[2:18] sometimes you're very healthy and the
[2:20] next moment you are sick
[2:22] sometimes you have mountains you have
[2:25] valleys you have
[2:26] and each one is unique that god has made
[2:29] us
[2:29] and every city has its own beauty the
[2:31] urban has its own beauty cape china has
[2:33] its own beauty
[2:35] elizabeth harter wherever you go every
[2:37] set he's like a female
[2:38] it has his own beauty and so we can see
[2:41] god reflecting himself
[2:43] through the universe because god's
[2:44] nature was his first bible
[2:47] so we are born again by the word of
[2:48] light and as long as we on the earth
[2:50] brother bannon says we'll have a sticky
[2:52] nature that will always bother us
[2:54] there's going to be a nature of the 90s
[2:56] that's going to come in your body
[2:58] you're going to behave like your
[2:59] grandfather and you're going to behave
[3:01] like somebody in your distant family
[3:04] and that's all pressed into your body
[3:05] you're born again you're in the messy
[3:07] church you love the lord
[3:09] you're a preacher you're a deacon but
[3:10] the nature of the ancestors or the
[3:12] family
[3:13] is traced right within you and brother
[3:15] manning chased that little german boy
[3:17] and
[3:18] his mother was his father was irish his
[3:20] mother was german
[3:22] and he says i wish that little boy never
[3:23] get married because he will give any
[3:25] woman hell on the earth
[3:27] because of the traits of the family that
[3:29] is inbred into you
[3:31] and sometimes you see your father in you
[3:33] you see your
[3:34] grandfather reflecting backing your
[3:36] children and you
[3:37] you wish that wasn't there but brother
[3:39] manning says as long as you're in this
[3:41] body
[3:42] you'll have a sticky nature that will
[3:43] always bother you but on the inside you
[3:45] are born again
[3:47] and so we are born again and that will
[3:49] always bother us because we have light
[3:51] and we have darkness
[3:52] and we go through a continuous cycle a
[3:55] continuous cycle
[3:56] things go good for you then things goes
[3:58] bad for you again and then you become
[4:00] moody you go
[4:01] ups and you have your ups and downs but
[4:04] god is the one who is the one who gives
[4:05] divine revelation
[4:06] and revelation is there not to give you
[4:09] information
[4:10] not to win every argument to show that
[4:12] how much they're clever you are
[4:14] but revelation is overcoming power
[4:17] revelation brings humility
[4:19] and revelation brings god to you again
[4:22] and so nothing that man is invented as
[4:24] any enduring substance
[4:26] weak weapons of science they can make
[4:28] ventilators they can make oxygen
[4:30] machines
[4:31] uh they can make so many stuff but it's
[4:33] all called weak weapons of science
[4:35] and it's got no enduring substance god
[4:38] was the one who breathed the breath of
[4:39] life
[4:40] and man became a living soul so god's
[4:42] breath is more stronger than any weapons
[4:44] that science can produce
[4:46] and so our homes our cars our clothing
[4:49] uh it all gets old uh we can say that's
[4:52] my new home
[4:53] but it gets old uh your home that's you
[4:55] can say well that's my home but that's
[4:57] that home is not really you you can say
[5:00] well that's my cell phone
[5:01] but that cell phone is not really you
[5:03] you can say that's my body but that body
[5:05] is not really you
[5:06] it's only a reflection of another one is
[5:09] waiting for you amen
[5:10] and so we can see god is a bodybuilder
[5:13] god designed
[5:14] mortal bodies god designed theophanies
[5:16] and god is also a designer of glorified
[5:19] bodies
[5:19] so we have three bodies most people only
[5:21] know this body
[5:23] and that's the only body that looked to
[5:24] and that's the only one that keep
[5:26] healthy
[5:27] but there's another body that is more
[5:28] greater than this one
[5:30] and so we can see for all of us life has
[5:32] rich joys
[5:33] life has got rich joys and happiness
[5:36] your kids are university
[5:38] they go to college and you have joys and
[5:40] god is fully earth with goodness
[5:43] there's bananas there's advocate of
[5:45] pears there's uh there's so much
[5:47] you can enjoy the fruits of the field
[5:50] and everything around god gives us rain
[5:52] god gives us sunshine
[5:54] god gives us health god gives us a word
[5:56] god gives us a family
[5:58] and as many people are praying for a
[6:00] baby and god has blessed you with five
[6:01] children
[6:03] and so god is the one who gives us joys
[6:05] and gives us happiness
[6:07] and we recognize that joy and goodness
[6:10] is all around us
[6:11] all around us we can see there's
[6:12] goodness there's joys
[6:15] there are people that are happy and we
[6:16] can see the joys of god
[6:18] and god made different varieties of
[6:20] fruits thousands of different fruits
[6:22] and god is my third certain herbs of the
[6:25] field
[6:26] and everything that you need for your
[6:27] body is in the earth amen because your
[6:29] body comes from the earth
[6:31] god make garlic with the properties of
[6:33] the garlic to become
[6:34] antibiotics god has made the lemon with
[6:37] antibiotics with
[6:39] the ingredients in that lemon that can
[6:41] heal your body
[6:42] god has made ginger god has made
[6:43] turmeric goddess make hand pepper
[6:46] goddess made all the herbs of the field
[6:48] to heal your body
[6:49] so everything is in the body when your
[6:51] forefathers never
[6:53] went to desk or went to a pharmacy they
[6:55] went to the back of the yard
[6:57] your mother knew exactly what tree to go
[6:59] to your mother would take a leave from
[7:01] the tree
[7:02] boil it up and give it to you and you
[7:03] were better your mother was a pharmacist
[7:06] because you knew exactly what you need
[7:08] for the human body
[7:09] because the human body doesn't live by
[7:11] any pharmacy but it lives by
[7:13] by the fields of the fruits of the
[7:15] fields that god has given on the earth
[7:17] and everything that god has given for
[7:19] the human body
[7:20] is right in the earth and everything you
[7:22] need for the journey
[7:23] is right in the message you don't have
[7:26] to go anywhere else rapturing fake lies
[7:28] in the message
[7:29] changing the body lines in the message
[7:31] because it's got resurrection seeds
[7:34] the messengers said that other robots
[7:35] are pentecostal seeds
[7:37] and uh billy grahams of evangelistic
[7:40] seeds but malachi 4 so resurrection
[7:44] so if the seeds if your earth is the
[7:46] seed of the ground
[7:47] and you sow the seeds of malachi 4 it
[7:49] will produce another mannequin amen
[7:52] it will produce rapture in grace it will
[7:55] reproduce whatever
[7:56] if it worked for the man that ate it it
[7:58] will work for you as well
[8:00] amen because the seeds that you sow and
[8:03] that's why your mind
[8:04] is such a tool in the hands of god
[8:06] that's why satan wants your mind and god
[8:08] wants your mind
[8:09] that's why social media has destroyed
[8:11] people's minds
[8:12] and it's manipulated people's minds what
[8:15] they're here i'm seeing in fox news and
[8:17] radio show and radio this and news and
[8:19] what's ups and
[8:20] and all these viral messages is there to
[8:22] destroy your thinking
[8:24] right but god wants your mind for the
[8:26] first time we can think like god
[8:28] we can now talk like god we can think
[8:31] that god had a threefold mystery
[8:33] in the back part of his mind so now what
[8:35] was in god's eternal thoughts
[8:37] and we can say before god was god
[8:40] and you could say before god even made
[8:42] lucifer god already and put my name in
[8:44] the landscape
[8:46] now you can't say that that william
[8:48] branham came on the scene
[8:49] and took us before genesis he says we
[8:51] can say in the beginning
[8:53] but i'm going to take you before the
[8:55] beginning so we can see
[8:57] that we experience satisfying sights and
[8:59] sounds and
[9:00] beautiful sounds of the year and we
[9:04] enjoy smells we enjoy tastes we enjoy
[9:07] adventure
[9:08] and it's got riches and it's got many
[9:11] joys
[9:12] many people are happy they some days a
[9:14] day vacation for them they can
[9:16] enjoy the ocean they can go scuba diving
[9:20] they can climb the mountain they can do
[9:22] a hiking trip
[9:23] and many people have beautiful sounds
[9:25] and sights and everything around the
[9:26] universe goddess bless the universe
[9:29] but so many things but at the same time
[9:32] we must face reality
[9:34] that life is full of trouble amen with
[9:36] all the joys and
[9:38] all the happiness and all the sights and
[9:40] the sounds and
[9:41] and with everything that god has we must
[9:43] understand our life is full of trouble
[9:46] man that is born of a woman is in a few
[9:48] days and full of trouble
[9:50] you can leave durban and go to australia
[9:53] trouble will follow you
[9:54] you can leave levin and go to america
[9:56] trouble will follow you
[9:58] you can go to the best church in the
[9:59] world trouble will follow you
[10:01] because you have internal trouble you
[10:03] have external trouble
[10:05] it doesn't say man born of god but man
[10:07] born of a woman
[10:08] is full of trouble so troubles are part
[10:10] of our journey
[10:12] and we have all those things that is
[10:13] coming us but the bible said that the
[10:15] unseen is more real
[10:16] that what we can see so what we look at
[10:19] today there's nothing new under the sun
[10:21] job lost his children he lost his cattle
[10:25] uh he lost his feels he lost everything
[10:28] and even his wife said why didn't you
[10:29] curse god and die
[10:31] now you can lose everything you can lose
[10:33] your husband you can lose your wife
[10:35] your daughter your son and yet you have
[10:37] everything because you have god
[10:40] job lost everything and yet he had
[10:42] everything and he has god
[10:44] once you have god and these revealed
[10:46] thoughts for the day
[10:47] you have everything because god is the
[10:49] sum of total perfection
[10:51] and so we can see that job says man is
[10:54] born and
[10:54] troubled jesus said in this world you
[10:57] will have trouble
[10:58] so jesus said be in this world you have
[11:00] trouble and james says you will fall
[11:03] into various trials
[11:05] so jesus said father uh in this world
[11:07] you have trouble but
[11:08] he be be not discouraged i have overcome
[11:11] the water amen
[11:12] so uh we understand you're born under
[11:15] trouble the earth is nothing but a
[11:17] testing ground
[11:18] you are tested with a family you wonder
[11:20] now why did my mom leave my dad
[11:23] why did this happen and why do i have to
[11:25] struggle why was i born
[11:26] under this country and why would i be
[11:29] this
[11:30] and and but god has allowed everything
[11:32] to come your way amen
[11:33] and god has designed every trouble
[11:35] everything in the church
[11:37] and brother bannon says that god can
[11:38] split the church in half
[11:40] and god can give you a sick bed and god
[11:43] can turn all your friends against you
[11:45] just to prove that you're receiving them
[11:47] amen so the message is not dealing with
[11:49] groups it deals with individuals
[11:52] it's not a group revelation but it's an
[11:54] individual revelation
[11:56] and that's why god has allowed that
[11:57] rhonda virus god to restruct it
[12:00] and what god allowed it to bring out
[12:02] underlying ailments with people
[12:04] there are people that will never come to
[12:05] church again because it was laying there
[12:08] dormant in there
[12:09] and whatever is underlined it will
[12:11] surface up and so god put pressure
[12:14] on us and the pressure that god puts
[12:16] upon us is to bring out the good that is
[12:18] within us
[12:20] and so none of us can question the fact
[12:23] that life can bring
[12:24] disappointment we can't question the
[12:27] fact that life or great disappointment
[12:29] uh it is it is it is filled with
[12:31] unexpected terms
[12:33] terms that you don't expect today you
[12:35] can be healthy
[12:37] and tomorrow you can have a sick bed and
[12:39] tomorrow you can be an invalid tomorrow
[12:41] somebody has to pick you up
[12:43] and somebody has to take you to the
[12:44] bathroom somebody has to shave you
[12:46] and today you can be healthy and
[12:49] tomorrow things can
[12:50] turn around unexpected turns
[12:53] then we find there is sudden deaths
[12:56] sudden accidents
[12:57] you dive down the road one morning and
[12:59] somebody loses with breaks
[13:01] goes into you and then you have an
[13:03] accident you phone your mom i'm in
[13:05] hospital i'm in bed
[13:06] and they put me off for six months to
[13:08] get healed again
[13:09] but god knows the end from the beginning
[13:13] god knows how to chastise us how to
[13:15] bring the best out of us
[13:17] god had to actually send blast moses out
[13:19] of moses
[13:21] god to him of the wilderness god had to
[13:23] give brother venom
[13:24] i took away his wife to the way his
[13:26] daughter
[13:27] and he wanted to commit suicide twice
[13:29] but god had to
[13:30] do certain things to bring the best out
[13:32] of it and so god
[13:34] will do certain things and use certain
[13:36] things to bring the best out of you
[13:38] and so we find that uh today we are
[13:40] healthy
[13:41] and tomorrow we are sick unexpected
[13:43] turns revenge in life
[13:45] you have your rain pain then sickness
[13:47] strikes your family
[13:49] you have your bone pain you have
[13:50] security up your home
[13:52] and you put the fence up and you put
[13:55] security out
[13:56] and that thickness strikes your heel and
[13:58] your children brings you shape
[14:00] one of your sons is daddy i'm going to
[14:02] divorce my wife
[14:04] i beat him this marriage for five years
[14:06] but i call naked she's dominating she's
[14:08] dominating my life
[14:09] and she will say daddy i'm leaving this
[14:11] man because man is an abusive military
[14:13] slave driver
[14:15] and so we find you have unexpected turns
[14:18] and you're looking for a time when
[14:20] wilder's all sees
[14:22] when will this all seems that you don't
[14:24] have any trouble
[14:26] any corona virus no wearing your mars
[14:29] no eating bad foods and
[14:32] when are we gonna have there's no
[14:34] jealousy no anger
[14:35] no hatred uh no fighting and there's
[14:38] gonna be peace
[14:39] and we're all looking for that day when
[14:41] we leave this earth we go into a body
[14:43] that is called supreme breast and joy
[14:46] and so we can find that life that's like
[14:49] the longer you live the wider your
[14:51] experience
[14:52] the longer you live on the earth the
[14:53] wider will your experience be
[14:55] and the more people you meet there will
[14:57] be more pain and more difficulty
[15:00] if you have a big church you have lots
[15:02] of trouble
[15:03] if you have a small church you have
[15:05] small trouble if you have no church you
[15:07] have no troubles
[15:09] but it's part of journey and you can
[15:12] have a family church and you're going to
[15:13] family problems
[15:15] and you can be individual in your home
[15:16] and you can have a beautiful home
[15:18] but don't happy in that home you have
[15:20] china where you have everything to your
[15:22] heart's desire
[15:23] and yet your husband doesn't love you he
[15:26] doesn't do things for you that you
[15:27] really feel like you're a woman
[15:29] and so you find that the material things
[15:31] of life doesn't give a joy the only joy
[15:33] you find
[15:34] is to find god and the message of the
[15:37] hour has made god very real to us amen
[15:39] it took god
[15:40] from history and made god present to us
[15:44] he took god from before genesis and he
[15:46] took god right back in the beginning
[15:48] and gave us the big picture we could
[15:51] only see the small picture
[15:52] every minister will preach to you
[15:54] denominations can only preach the small
[15:56] picture but we see the big picture
[15:58] we see why god has allowed us and why
[16:00] god has purposed that
[16:01] and god even designed his own enemy if
[16:04] you ever thought about that that
[16:06] lucifer was was an associate pastor
[16:10] the only thing he couldn't do he
[16:11] couldn't create but god designing it
[16:14] and god even the left against open god
[16:16] allowed sin to come into the earth
[16:18] if there was no sin there would be no
[16:20] sickness
[16:21] and if there was no sin there would be
[16:22] no death but if there was no sin
[16:25] there would not be a savior and if there
[16:27] was no sickness he would not be a healer
[16:29] so certain things that god had to allow
[16:32] in his permissive world
[16:33] but now we can see the bigger picture
[16:35] amen why god did certain things
[16:38] the outside world said god is unfair the
[16:40] outside world says you must do this and
[16:42] we must do this to go to heaven
[16:44] god says no i've already chosen you
[16:46] before you chose me
[16:48] and i love you before you even love me
[16:50] so you can see it's not even
[16:51] your struggles but it's all what god has
[16:54] done for you
[16:55] you're never asked to give me an entire
[16:56] message uh you've never prayed lord
[16:58] please say to william branham
[17:00] please send malachi 4. you'll never knew
[17:02] about
[17:03] you were in hindu you were in some
[17:05] church in some organization you never
[17:07] knew nothing about
[17:08] the end time god but god already knew
[17:11] that he was going to be in the bible
[17:13] yeah god really sent him took him away
[17:15] again took him home
[17:17] and yet you are thinking uh you're
[17:19] thinking that i'm just
[17:20] in the church and so like and so
[17:23] sometimes you might think
[17:24] that our burdens is unique what i go
[17:27] through
[17:28] as the family is unique but it's the
[17:30] same old
[17:32] trial somebody else has gone through and
[17:34] you might think what
[17:35] we as the nagy family go through nobody
[17:38] else has gone through
[17:40] we we are unique family and you touch
[17:42] one of us who touch all of us
[17:44] because we are very special we are
[17:45] unique and
[17:47] uh there is nothing but there is nothing
[17:49] new under the sun
[17:50] somebody else has gone through it
[17:52] somebody else at this very moment is
[17:54] going through worst things that you go
[17:55] through
[17:57] somebody else has lost his own entire
[17:58] family somebody else has done things
[18:01] that
[18:02] and maybe going through things that you
[18:04] will never dream that you will go
[18:05] through
[18:06] so we can see there's nothing new under
[18:08] the sun and we see the nature
[18:11] the nature has nature has perpetual life
[18:14] it produces the same fruits all the time
[18:17] same apples for six thousand years
[18:19] there's been apples
[18:20] uh there's been bananas there's been
[18:22] avocado pears there's been
[18:23] peaches and apples and uh there is in
[18:26] the herbs of the field
[18:27] perpetual life it's been producing all
[18:29] the time
[18:30] there's nothing new under this earth you
[18:32] know next season is going to be mango
[18:34] season
[18:34] you know the fishes of the ocean god has
[18:36] designed everything
[18:38] for humanity and so we can see that
[18:41] our troubles are trials as a beginning
[18:43] and there have an
[18:44] end they are not eternal that's why hell
[18:48] is not eternal
[18:49] hell was designed for the devil and his
[18:51] angels if you have eternal life
[18:53] and you go to hell you will outlive hell
[18:56] because you see you cannot be in hell if
[18:59] you have eternal life
[19:00] eternal life means you will never had a
[19:02] beginning you never ever made it
[19:04] all's got a beginning he's got a name so
[19:07] it was designed for the devil and his
[19:08] angels and so we can see
[19:10] that we've been placing the earth to be
[19:13] tested
[19:15] and we have bypass of the effort now the
[19:18] question is
[19:19] which body did god first make the first
[19:21] god make the mortal body
[19:23] or did god make ethiopia god friends
[19:25] made your theology
[19:26] and god took a picture of me and in that
[19:29] picture god never saw you smoking
[19:31] drinking god saw you perfect
[19:33] amen and brother branham says you you
[19:35] bypass your author
[19:37] you recognize the message of the hour to
[19:39] the eagle food you hear from your theory
[19:41] amen so what is god doing god is now
[19:44] influencing you back from your therapy
[19:46] there's a body on the other side that
[19:48] looks like you
[19:50] got the same features same eyes same
[19:53] texture
[19:54] when you were young uh brother bannon
[19:56] says when i saw them their eyes was
[19:58] glistening like the stars of heaven
[20:00] their teeth was as white as squirrel and
[20:03] there was no
[20:03] yesterday there was no tomorrow it was
[20:06] perfection
[20:07] and so you can understand there's a
[20:09] world that is more real than this one
[20:12] and so we've seen we've been placed on
[20:14] the earth to be tested
[20:15] we have bypass autophagy and we are in
[20:18] this body for character molding
[20:21] so god molds you you have a temper uh
[20:23] you're impatient and you have
[20:25] several things that you have in your
[20:28] life and god has to mold you
[20:29] maybe you are addicted to pornography
[20:31] addicted to the internet
[20:33] and god has to now work with you and god
[20:36] has to give you heavy trials
[20:38] to detox you from that so god knows you
[20:41] can spend hours and hours
[20:42] watching social network and god wants to
[20:45] have your time in your mind for him
[20:47] so god has to do something to detox you
[20:50] away from that
[20:52] and to give your attention to god that's
[20:54] why the toronto virus was sent by god
[20:56] god has allowed that
[20:58] to bring the best out of you and so we
[21:00] can see
[21:01] that we did not decide to be here and
[21:03] you never decided to be there amen
[21:06] and you had no choice coming to the
[21:08] earth and you never decided to be a
[21:10] naive or ready or a chatty or
[21:12] or or the crash or whatever you
[21:14] certainly might be
[21:16] you had no choice and in that certain
[21:18] family there was an inherited disease
[21:21] there was heart failure in that family
[21:22] there was mainly there was
[21:24] arthritis there were sugar beaters in
[21:26] their family and you inherited because
[21:28] of your great grandfather
[21:30] so suddenly brother bannon says becomes
[21:32] inheritory
[21:34] and also sickness travels through
[21:35] genetics and also your christian birth
[21:38] travels by the genes of god
[21:40] you are what you are because you are
[21:42] part of god and you are what you are
[21:44] because you're part of a certain family
[21:47] and you are what you are because you
[21:48] were born by adam and adam
[21:50] all died in christ all is made alive so
[21:54] we did not decide to be here and we had
[21:56] no choice of a family
[21:58] you have no choice of gender i wish i
[21:59] was a male
[22:01] and i wish i was a female but god made
[22:04] you a female of god made your way
[22:06] and our faith is not a pain-free life
[22:09] our faith in christ is not pain-free you
[22:11] don't come at the message
[22:13] to be pain-free sometimes when you
[22:15] commit a message you have more troubles
[22:16] that you have
[22:17] when you are in denomination what
[22:20] troubles come by
[22:21] you say well is this really the message
[22:23] of the hour maya there's no love here
[22:26] and but god allows that god allows
[22:29] everything because god wants to deal
[22:30] with you not with love
[22:32] not with food parcels but god deals you
[22:34] with divine revelation
[22:36] so god wants to get a hold of you so you
[22:38] look at love you look at who preach you
[22:40] who gives you a full parcel who's love
[22:42] you who hugs you
[22:43] and who's kind to you or i'm going to
[22:45] join that church because there's lots of
[22:47] love in that church
[22:49] there's nothing to do with that it's a
[22:51] view of divine revelation
[22:53] and so you see we have to understand
[22:56] that some people
[22:58] view serving god is about life here and
[23:02] now
[23:03] it's not about life here and now it's
[23:05] about eternity
[23:07] you're not on the earth to create
[23:08] legacies i've got so many churches
[23:11] i've given up so much money i've done
[23:13] this and i've done this for god
[23:14] uh you're not on the earth to create the
[23:16] legacy amen but you're on the earth to
[23:18] prepare for eternity
[23:20] and so we can see what a paradox into
[23:23] the natural male and
[23:24] sin under trouble he cannot see joy in
[23:26] trouble
[23:28] and james has counted all joy when you
[23:30] fall into trouble
[23:31] now a natural man he cannot see a joy he
[23:34] wants to commit suicide he wants to take
[23:36] his life
[23:36] he goes to the bar he drinks himself he
[23:39] cannot see god
[23:40] in pain and suffering struggling and
[23:43] he's breathing to survive
[23:45] if god would ask what would you refer in
[23:47] life we would
[23:48] we would prefer a life of trouble free
[23:51] if god would ask you what would you
[23:53] refer in life you will say god
[23:55] i want the life trouble free i want to
[23:57] love everybody
[23:58] i don't want any trouble in the church i
[24:00] don't want to trouble my family
[24:02] i want my grandkids i want my children
[24:04] to be nice
[24:05] and i don't want trouble because you're
[24:07] on top of your life
[24:09] but life when you pray for a life of
[24:11] comfort
[24:12] that's what we do in our normal natural
[24:15] being
[24:16] lord protect me from this and lord save
[24:18] me from that
[24:20] and don't let this happen to me i don't
[24:22] want suffering if i feel sick
[24:24] lord make me well i'm i'm
[24:27] while depending on others to help me we
[24:30] pray that
[24:31] we said lord if i'm sick make me better
[24:33] a lord give me good friends
[24:35] and lord do this for me do this one but
[24:37] god knows how to bring the best out of
[24:39] you amen
[24:40] and sometimes you are moody nobody's
[24:42] upset you you're just feeling moody
[24:44] because god has allowed that so that you
[24:46] can pray
[24:47] and you can say god please take the
[24:48] spirit away from me and brother bannon
[24:50] said the only way to calm your nerves is
[24:52] prayer
[24:53] amen you can go to descent you can buy
[24:55] tablets up the tablets
[24:57] and your bathroom can look like a small
[24:59] chemist
[25:00] of all the antibiotics you've never
[25:02] taken the full course
[25:03] and this and that and this is ebola but
[25:05] all those things will never help you
[25:08] it's got side effects the only thing
[25:10] that can help you and save you
[25:11] is almighty god and so we can see an
[25:14] immediate response to the trial is a
[25:16] prayer
[25:17] lord get me out of this trouble that's
[25:19] the immediate response when we're in
[25:21] trouble lord please
[25:22] get me out of this trouble lord take me
[25:25] away from durban take him away from my
[25:27] family
[25:28] i don't want to be with my in-laws i
[25:29] don't want to be with them i want to be
[25:31] somewhere else i can live a lot
[25:34] but god has allowed you to be in a
[25:35] certain situation
[25:37] and god has put you in the message for
[25:39] trials
[25:40] and god has put you in that you love
[25:42] everybody you love your pentecostal
[25:44] friends
[25:45] you love your methodists you love your
[25:46] neighbors god has chastised you
[25:49] this is not a cult that you join this is
[25:51] god dealing with you
[25:52] amen and so you don't hear people pray
[25:55] lord i'm in great trouble
[25:56] keep me until your recovery is what you
[25:59] want to accomplish
[26:00] nobody prays lord if i'm in this trouble
[26:02] please lord keep me
[26:04] we don't hear prayer requests coming
[26:06] lord but the girl wants more trials and
[26:08] more suffering
[26:09] no he wants more money he wants a better
[26:11] job he wants to go for interview
[26:14] we always have requests for something
[26:15] that's good
[26:17] we don't have requests but sister mary
[26:18] wants to bring
[26:20] wants you to bring something into a life
[26:23] that will draw
[26:24] away from sin and material things that
[26:26] is hindering the growth
[26:27] you don't hear that pray brother jack
[26:29] wants a trial at work
[26:30] for god to give you more patience and
[26:32] remove the spirit of envy and jealousy
[26:35] we're going to hear that we always ask
[26:38] for success
[26:39] for increase a better job better home
[26:42] lord make me well
[26:43] my husband he seeks my children he said
[26:45] lord do this do this but we don't ask
[26:47] for trouble
[26:49] but god says county dog joy when you
[26:50] fall into it
[26:52] because behind it god is dealing with
[26:54] you
[26:55] and so brother managing down everything
[26:57] that has been we ask for prosperity
[27:00] and we ask for a better lifestyle that's
[27:03] what politicians carry a vote for us
[27:05] we'll give you a better lifestyle we'll
[27:08] give you better service delivery
[27:09] we'll clean your roads we'll do this for
[27:11] you just put your mark on us and we will
[27:13] do this for you
[27:15] and brother madam says that herod was a
[27:17] politician and jesus identified
[27:19] all politicians as foxes can't inherit
[27:21] the fox and the fox is very slight
[27:24] he'll tell you something he'll do
[27:25] something else but that's why we can put
[27:28] our faith
[27:28] in god in the message of the hour
[27:31] because that's what our strength lies
[27:33] and that's why if you want to be
[27:34] spiritual strong you've got to read the
[27:36] word
[27:38] you've got to take a book a week and
[27:39] feed upon it
[27:41] and if you don't understand just read it
[27:43] it doesn't matter if you're
[27:45] if your mind is unfruitful but if you
[27:47] feed in the world you're feeding
[27:48] yourself
[27:50] if you eat bananas and avocado pears and
[27:52] you eat healthy fruits
[27:53] there's something in the body is you eat
[27:55] the fruit in five minutes time you eat
[27:57] all that food
[27:58] the wife can take two hours to prepare
[28:00] that meal and in five minutes you can
[28:02] consume that food but organs in the body
[28:04] will take over
[28:05] and then supply the kidneys they will
[28:07] supply the lungs that this
[28:09] every part of the body will be supplied
[28:11] and so the moment you eat on the message
[28:13] of the element
[28:14] take the book take a pen write down if
[28:17] you take one book for one week
[28:19] or one book for one month feed upon it
[28:21] and by feeding upon it you're feeding
[28:23] your soul
[28:24] and as you feed your soul it will bring
[28:27] your spirit and your body in subjection
[28:29] to that
[28:30] the reason why people are struggling
[28:31] because they're not feeding
[28:34] and the reason people are doing things
[28:36] because they're not feeding
[28:37] they are what you eat if you eat if you
[28:40] eat methodist food you'll become a
[28:42] methodist if you eat baptist food you'll
[28:44] become a baptist
[28:46] if you give pentecostal food you'll
[28:47] become pentecostal
[28:49] if you get messy through it you'll
[28:50] become a massive believer
[28:52] because it will produce after its own
[28:54] time and so
[28:56] people are seeking a better lifestyle we
[28:59] review things temporarily and we view
[29:02] things materially
[29:03] and we do things physically everything
[29:06] is temporary
[29:07] everything is materially everything is
[29:09] physically
[29:10] what we should be praying is for perfect
[29:12] faith amen
[29:14] because brother madam says perfect faith
[29:16] is the master of all circumstances
[29:18] once god gives you perfect faith you've
[29:20] got a master's degree
[29:23] a degree that you can handle opposition
[29:26] you can handle a stubborn wife you can
[29:27] handle a stubborn husband
[29:29] you can handle maybe an abusive
[29:31] mother-in-law you can handle a colic at
[29:34] work
[29:34] you can handle another pastor you can
[29:36] handle false doctrine
[29:38] you can handle anything that comes your
[29:40] way because you've got a master's degree
[29:43] that's what god wants you to have his
[29:45] perfect faith in his work
[29:47] knowing that god has allowed things to
[29:49] happen and god has purpose
[29:51] the things that will happen so that god
[29:53] can chastise you and bring the best out
[29:55] of you
[29:56] what we should be praying is for trials
[29:59] what we should be praying
[30:00] is for trials because that's how our
[30:03] faith is perfected
[30:04] god affects you by trials that's why
[30:07] brother man says god can
[30:09] turn your family around and god can
[30:12] split your church you know
[30:14] and god can give you a sick bed and god
[30:16] can do this and god can do almost
[30:18] anything
[30:20] just to prove that you can handle it
[30:23] and that's why we thank god today we are
[30:25] not here because that we wanted to be in
[30:27] the message
[30:28] we never prayed lord please i want to be
[30:30] in the entire message lord please i want
[30:32] to go to heaven
[30:33] you're already in heaven before you come
[30:35] to the earth jesus says i come from
[30:38] heaven i go back to heaven
[30:39] jesus said that one that you see me
[30:41] talking to you i'm also in heaven
[30:43] so god is that dealing with temporal
[30:45] things and god doesn't give you temporal
[30:47] things
[30:47] god gives you eternal things that's what
[30:50] the message of the hour doesn't come
[30:52] from jeffersonville indiana
[30:53] it's not the intellectual property of
[30:55] william bannon but it's the voice of god
[30:57] it is god trying to deal with you as an
[31:00] individual
[31:01] because in the midst of suffering christ
[31:03] will display himself
[31:04] amen in the midst of hard times in the
[31:07] midst of
[31:07] suffering nullified for went through
[31:09] suffering but and
[31:11] god would let him speak things in
[31:13] existence and out of existence
[31:15] god never said brother bannon go out of
[31:17] the storm and then you speak the storm
[31:19] god says go back in the storm
[31:21] and once you're in the storm now you
[31:23] speak the storm of existence
[31:25] so god doesn't take you out of your
[31:27] troubles and out of the things you go
[31:29] through but god puts you
[31:30] right back there and god says now i want
[31:32] you to speak the storm of existence
[31:35] just imagine that we are now having a
[31:37] mosque and one day
[31:39] they're going to go from the mosque to
[31:40] the mark and they won't be able to buy
[31:43] you won't be able to sell it they can do
[31:45] force you to have a vaccine that you
[31:47] won't be able to employ
[31:48] as a teacher and you won't be able to
[31:50] employ you won't take a policy or
[31:52] discovery unless you have a vaccine
[31:54] certificate
[31:55] and they're going to force you and force
[31:56] you and one day you won't be able to do
[31:58] things and there's certain things that
[32:00] you have to take your stand
[32:02] the midwives took their stand they would
[32:04] not
[32:05] circumcise and kill all the children and
[32:08] god was with them
[32:10] and the midwives let every israelite be
[32:13] born so there's a time in your life
[32:15] that you will have to take a step you'll
[32:17] have to come against the system
[32:19] and god will have to come on to you the
[32:22] third pool is not going to be behind the
[32:23] pulpit
[32:24] some brother from america some brothers
[32:26] from africa this is a fantastic brother
[32:29] he's behind the platform he's the man of
[32:30] the hour no
[32:32] the turtle will go home with you and god
[32:35] will let you eat that one chicken
[32:37] for the whole month amen and god will
[32:40] put vitamins in that food
[32:42] and god will supply things for you in
[32:44] your home that you'll never dream
[32:46] that rule what stores will never provide
[32:48] for you god will be right for you
[32:50] because god is god and so we can
[32:53] understand that god is going to
[32:55] pressurize us
[32:56] and god is going to allow the system god
[32:58] has to give the roman system
[33:00] power to do what they have to do and no
[33:03] amount of protests
[33:05] no matter fighting
