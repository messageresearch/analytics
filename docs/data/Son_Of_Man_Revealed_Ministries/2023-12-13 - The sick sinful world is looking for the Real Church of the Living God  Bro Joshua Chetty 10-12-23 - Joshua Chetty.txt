his books amen it's the prophet visit South Africa amen we' like to thank you brother Sun amen for making these books available so we're going to give one to each family after the service amen speci the books on the table there we can give one to each family after the service amen so if you've never read it read it amen amen amen I believe you and I are the product because of what happened here amen hallelujah you know I was looking at one picture here and uh there was quite something I wonder who this man was but why I related to him was because amen if I can find the picture quickly I wonder what he knew about the message of the hour or what he understood amen this boy he's a young Bo here IND an Indian boy was instantly healed in the audience of a paralyzed and short leg amen amen so look at this this uh young boy I wonder if he ever got to experience the fullness of the word or he just accepted his healing amen but look at us amen and now the angel of the Lord was very particular that he comes to Durban South Africa amen hallelujah and I believe the Lord saw the pred destinated SE that was laying there amen hallelujah amen he saw Dan Naidu he saw Ronnie genen he saw Paul mudley you saw the early Believers amen amen hallelujah that the the sunlight of the word needed to shine upon their seed yes and dramatize it and bring it to life amen so we thankful amen for the ones that have paved the way and have gone before us and labored in the gospel that we can now enjoy the benefits of the word amen maybe in the early days they didn't understand understand much they were still grasping because the books were so scarce amen but now we are living in an age where technology is advance and we have the message at the tip of our fingertips amen so this book is available for you to read it I advise you young and old to read this book amen read the book and it will give you an insight into so yeah remember this book was documented because the angel of the Lord instructed brother brandom to get this brother to document all the events so in this book they tell you there was 45,000 people gathered at the race course 45,000 people so can you imagine what a scene that must have been Amen to see these people gathered there and you know brother Brandon says in one one alter call amen 30,000 Souls gave their life to the Lord Jesus Christ and he says the next day he was called amen the mayor of the city amen and six truckloads yes we're going past the hotel room of crutches wheelchairs hallelujah amen people being healed amen hallelujah amen so we just go down the memory lane and we thank the Lord because we know that he's the same yesterday today and forever if people come on the same basis of Faith amen he's able to move in the same way amen hallelujah so we're thankful for that amen so you grab yourself a copy each family grab yourself a copy am amen and you'll be blessed with that amen if you if you feel that you are getting a bit older

season to be placed upon the Earth for a reason amen yes uh I know the new birth is special to us but remember also the natural birth is also special because we had to be placed yes in a certain time and season and out of a million germs one had to have that life amen one had to come through yes amen one was predestinated to life am and it had to be born in a certain family line because certain people in that family landine was carrying that seed amen amen and they also were predestinated to be carriers of that seed yes so these things must be recognized that amen these things are not a these things are orchestrated is ordained by God Amen predestination is a great thing amen and we thank God that we be we could be kept under his predestinated plan everything that's around us is because of his predestinated plan for us amen nothing is out of cater with God everything is within his within context and within his perfect plan and perfect will amen so if you got your Bible this morning we'll turn to the book of 2 Kings read from chapter 2:9 we just going to continue on a few thoughts that have been spoken of in the past few recent weeks and we're going to continue as a spirit lead amen Adan is reminding me that we have Pastor Lon and his I didn't see God bless you brother sorry brother L uh we welcome you and part of the family pray the Lord richly bless you amen amen okay the book of 2 Kings chapter 2 reading from verse 9 and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit yes Lord amen be upon me amen amen yes so what he wants he want the spirit yes God takes his man but the spirit is still there amen [Music] absolutely amen but remember what he's saying here now before I be taken you must must ask yes so in other words before someone leaves everything had to be stored up yes everything had to be there with laying within the word amen and he said thou has as a OD thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so amen amen you got to recognize yes that there ones that gone on that they might be taken from us naturally but we can see by faith that they in another dimension yes amen and it came because that's what happened Elisha the the other dimension was open yes to Elisha yes to see another dimension amen and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire ERS of fire amen and parted them both as and Elijah went up by Whirlwind into heaven amen a dimension is open up to Elisha and dimension has been opened to us in this hour that we can see the supernatural in this hour amen you Lord amen oh yes and Elijah saw it and cried amen you seen the supernatural in his hour my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the asman thereof and he saw him no more and he took all of his own clothes and ran them in two pieces yes he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smokee the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah it wasn't good enough that he had the mantle but now he want to operate in the spirit of Elijah so now he's crying out for the Lord God of that was in upon Elijah must be upon Him amen amen thank you and he took the mantle sorry and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they parted ID and tid and Elijah went over amen and when the sons of the prophets which were to view you at Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Elijah that rest on Elisha see now they're not recognizing just the mental they're recognizing the spirit amen amen and they came to meet him and bow themselves to the ground before him amen you may be seated hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen is not good just to say we believe this message we believe that God sent us a prophet amen but where is the god of Elijah amen amen The Same Spirit that was Elijah must rest upon us amen because it's the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost amen it's the same holy ghost that was operating through the church ages it was the same holy ghost that was operating in William brandham it must be the same Holy Ghost operating in the church today am amen praise the Lord we're going to speak this morning the sick sinful world is looking for a real Church of the Living God yes am amen amen you believe we have we are in a time where the world is sinful yes it's sick amen when you ask people what church they attend they usually identify a denomination yes but the word church means called out one am so this word that's why the the this people in this world that are looking for the real Church yes yes I don't believe people go to church or just to to to because they recognize they going to a denomination no they're going to they want seeking God they they want some help they're going to church because they want some peace yes they want some help in their life and the god that they read about in his Bible they want to see this God in the church but unfortunately Satan has come and deceive them yes Satan has got him gripped on his grip amen when they go into the World Church they find a cold former religion yes and they find find a place of entertainment but what they don't find is the power and demonstration of the Gospel of Jesus christu and if we claiming that we are the call out ones we claiming that we are the church the real church then we must be we must be the antidotes we must be the medicine to the people that are sick to the sick and sinful world we must be the Cure we must be the thing that they need right now because the world is crying out there is no help for them there is no hope for them but the only people with hope is the people that receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that is the True Church of Jesus Christ that is the bread of Christ that's the body of Christ that's come in Oneness with the head amen amen that you such in a union with him that all they see is Jesus Christ yes amen amen amen because second Timo 3 says this I know also that in the last days perilous time shall come oh yes for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unth thankful Unholy without natural affection truth breakers for false accusers incontinent Fierce despises of those that are good traitors he I minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God Amen having a form of godliness by denying the power thereof amen you know we can put that in right now in the message of the hour yes having a form of godliness having the right Church order and Doctrine having the right word but not having the spirit with the word amen amen the letter kill it but the spirit give life amen you're having a form of godliness by denying the power because this gospel comes with power and demonstration hallelujah amen it comes down with a power when you receive this message this message came supernaturally amen Seven Angels Came Down From Another Dimension amen broke the time barrier amen thank you Lord and he comes down in this atmosphere it comes down seven Thunders come to awaken you amen once you were lost you in spiritual Amnesia but the seven Thunders come to show you you're not part of this world you have a different speciesj you are a supernatural being trapped in a pestil you are trapped in a temporary body but you are a supernatural being amen you are from a different civilization amen amen amen that comes from a different atmosphere amen that come in this day that was Supernatural you can't say now you believe this message which is Supernatural and deny the power thereof amen amen hallelujah he says for of this sord are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly woman Laden with sins Laden with diverse lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truths now as Janice and jamas withstood Moses so these also resisted should men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith now these are the theologians of the world the denomination and so forth you got them false prophets false teachers false anointed ones in the end times amen but if there's false there must be the genuine absolutely if they want to go down and and practice the gifts of the Holy Spirit and claim that they got the gifts of the holy spirit there must be the genuine am amenu if there's a false there must if there's a counterfeit there must be a real and there must be a real first before become a counterfeit amen because you can't have a counterfeit without the original amen amen but we go back to the original gospel the same gospel the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost amen amen I'm not ashamed to say that I had a Pentecostal experience I'm not saying I'm one of them amen I'm not ashamed to say I'm one of them that had the baptism of the holy spirit cuz had it not been for the baptism of the Holy Spirit the world would have taken me away the world would have taken me out of this the brought unbelief the word would have brought things that will make you look at the message and judge it and reason with it and it will take away Faith from it amen it will bring doubt but if you got the baptism of the Holy Spirit oh Hallelujah it'll tie up scripture upon scripture line upon PR line precept upon precept here a little there a little Hallelujah taking you from Genesis to Revelation taking you through the church ages seeing the pattern of God working in his church amen that's right and let me tell you something when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't remain because the Holy Ghost is moving taking from one Junction to another Junction amen from one season to another season you don't want the Holy Ghost to stand on it you don't want it to settle there and say I'm I'm satisfied with this I'm going to denominate denominator around you you know what you know what will happen you're going to walk 40 years in the wilderness you're going to go around ground in circles amen but you're going no way amen but when you follow the move of the spirit oh after you finish this Junction it's going to take you to another Junction all take you from Glory unto glory amen he's going to say come up high yes amen prise Lord thank you Lord thank you Jesus proph of God says notice now as Elijah went up and Jesus Promised a a double portion of his Spirit to the Believers amen the things that I do shall you do also even greater and on the day of Pentecost when he went up on the day of the Ascension on the day of Pentecost the same Holy Ghost was upon Him amen come again upon the church and I wonder today people who claim to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and claim they have kissed the rims of the cup of blessings of God how can we hold our peace when we seeing things going on the way it is yes Lord it's time to take this Holy Spirit yes that we Anointed with and say where is the god that was Upon Jesus Christ where is the god that was in Abraham Isaac and Jacob where is the god that was on William brandham yes Hallelujah that's the blessings amen we sit back when the world is in loss when the world right now is in chaos when there's no hope for the mankind when you can see people crying out how can you be convinced of the gospel and not be concerned the Bible says when you fill with the Holy Ghost you are crying and sign for the abomination of the loss you are the people with hope when people come crying to you I got a family member that's dying in hospital the the doctors have given up on them I don't know what to do and that person is murmuring to you what do you do you can't remain the same amen you can't have the gospel and say no remain the same you got to give hope to that person you got to be the hope to the person because why you are Jesus Christ walking upon the Earth amen you are Jesus Christ right now because the world is not going to see the Jesus Christ that left 2,000 years ago they're going to see the Jesus they going to see Jesus Christ in his people amen working in his body amen thank you Lord doing the Greater Works yes yes yes amen you cannot receive the supernatural in hour and be defeated by natural circumstances amen amen hallelu you can't claim to have received the supernatural the supernatural message and you are being defeated by natural circumstances that things that are temporal things that pertain to the five senses yes but now you receive something from another world Amen yes Lord amen something that come that that the message that come the Lord that come and give us his message is the one that created this world oh yes that created all things around us this message has created Power yes this word has created a power amen yes amen that's right and you want to be defeated by your natural circumstances natural diseases that start at a beginning yes you never had a beginning oh yes you come from God Amen huah yes thank you Lord where you existed with God there was no sickness there was no diseases am thank you Lord diseases and sickness started it had a beginning they are temporal things because it's coming a time when there'll be no more amen no more sin no more sicknesses no more diseases so how can we be defeated by those natural things thank when you are supernatural being amen thank you Lord you wor about finan needs Jehovah G is our provider he's able to provide himself a sacrifice who create a power amen he can turn the circumstance around you worry about your loved one that's lost yeah out there when God is transforming power through his word amen this message come with a power to transform amen hallelujah yes amen he can take the violent Sinner and transform his life amen because he has transforming power you might say oh but that person's far gone I have no hope for them you don't have hope but the word come to give life and give it more abundantly amen oh yes Lord amen where is the god of Elijah is there in a people in a many membered body who received a double portion of his spirit thank you Lord amen when the people ask where is the god of Elijah where is the god of William brandham say no the god of that was in William brandham is in me amen I'm Anointed with the spirit of Christ I'm an anointed one in this time amen I'm not the false anointed one I am the anointed one amen Anointed with the spirit of Christ in this hour amen thank you Jesus prophet of God says now if you're not born again you do not believe in the Supernatural so here the people that debating the supernatural now somebody comes and debate the supernatural yes is because they're not born again if somebody is against the supernatural you need to tell them the bird that brought you on this Earth was only to bring the Natural Body absolutely amen but for you to leave this earth you need a new birth yes amen and when you have the new birth then I can discuss these things with you let's start with your first let's start to get you the right way first repent of your sin be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ start with justification sanctification then we can talk about the supernal things as soon as the debate with you take them back to the basics amen amen so he says now if you're not born again you do not believe in the Supernatural yes and if you do not believe in the Supernatural you'd haven't been born again yes because when you born again you become a Son of God Amen and if you're a Son of God and all that God all that Jesus did you must do as well because your coair with Jesus because now Jesus was the first born of the new creation amen of the new species Hallelujah a faith suiz delivering you from the scientific civilization and he will being a Son of God you're a nature of God then Peter says we are partakers of the Divine div nature amen amen amen hallelujah what a privileged people we are we are partakers of divine nature amen not just your natural elements here yes we're talking about divine nature God's nature amen amen and then you take on the things and you want to see the moving of God yes and see God move see you can't remain stagnant you want to see God move you want to see the moving of God you are not satisfied with just coming to church you're not just satisfied would I believe this message you're not just satisfied would God send me a prophet you're not just satisfied God a prophet you with the pull of fire you say no I want to see the pull of fire that with the prophet am us I want to see the same God that works among the prophet working amongst us you want to see the move of God yes thank you Jesus amen wonderful glory Lord because you're a son and you made in His image thank you you born of your spirit you're part of him and then you got faith for anything yes amen amen we talking about faith for anything now amen the supernatural must take place within you yes yes and then it will materialize in the natural for the natural things that you have amen anything that you have need of because you received the supernatural you're going to see it materialized in the natural yes amen forgive me for my throat the weather changed last night made my throat a bit o now the world that is sick what they need is the Living God Amen yes they don't want to they don't want to talk about a God in history m they've heard about the historical Jesus they read the foxes book of Martyrs they they they read about the apostles they read about what happened in the church ages and in this day they read about what happened in the days of the prophets yes these things are there to stir up your faith but they say right that's good enough but where is the Living God now yes amen you can't just take them and show them Point them to a scripture yes you can't just point them to quotes or pointing to some the prophet stories they want to see the Living God Amen if he's living means he's a present God Amen and you can't have the present God if you're not dwelling in his presence amen if you want to see this Jesus moving amongst you then you need to dwell in his presence amen amen and if you want to dwell in his presence then you can't be living like the world yes you can't be living like in a sinful condition because there's certain requirements amen for him to dwell in you his nature is different amen that's why he says we are made particles of his divine nature and if you're a Son of God you you have the nature of God in you and if you have the nature of God in you your taste bu change yes absolutely amen you put on a holy man's taste amen you no longer you no longer lust for the things of the world Amen and even if you for some reason you go and step into the things of the world you can't stay there amen you cannot remain in that condition that's right as a Son of God you will not be able to remain in that sinful condition because the Holy Ghost will take you out of there yes amen because you won't be able to digest it yes amen you won't be able to your makeup amen is changed amen hallelujah you you won't be able to uh condition yourself to remain in that sinful condition because you have the nature of God so they want to see the Living God and this living God wants to use you more than you want to be used amen because remember now Jesus did this part 2,000 years ago come to redeem us and the reason why he did that because he knew that he have to have a body to practice Dominion on the Earth again yes amen so he wants to use us because everything that we do is Christ in US amen am amen he's the hope of glory amen yes so when Jesus was on Earth Satan tried to offer him the kingdoms but Jesus knew that he was already H to it yes and he had a mission and his mission was Calvary yes because Calvary was the only hope for mankind that's right so he was faithful to his mission yes even though Satan offered it to him he didn't say Satan you are lying to me yes right no he knew Satan was running the kingdom of the earth he's the God of this evil age and so we are constantly being tempted yes by the pleasures of this life but we have a mission and we must remain focused amen amen Satan sorry when you don't have hair make sure you been here at night we find that Satan he wants to paralize our faith yes can you give me some more you want to paralyze our faith by making making us go off the straight and narrow road yes you know that's what he wants to do he wants to paralyze your faith and how do you paralyze your faith when you walk in wickedness when you remain in and remaining pleasures of this world he will paralyze your faith because what he does once he take you off that straight and narrow road and bring you into this world of pleasure yeah and remember it it is not he's going to do it very subtly yes that's right amen you might wonder you might think he's just going to take you and throw you into a nightclub or throw you to a A shabin or a pub or a brle house no he's not going to do that he's going to to work subtly yes amen how he's going to do it he's going to take you maybe through your career part is going to get you in your workplace is going to get you focused on those things building your Empire on the earth that's right building your career building your wealth building your fortunes trying to accumulate all your friends of the world yes beinging in good books with everybody around you God called us people that are segregated amen we don't hate people we love people because we must have the love of Christ but we don't go and fellowship and remain in the fellowship of unbelievers we go amongst them to show our testimony to show the hope that we have yes and we go to demonstrate the power of the Gospel yes but we don't go to join with them but we want to find that people want to satisfy all mankind yes they want to compromise and when you do that you have have to compromise yes if you want to be in good books with all of mankind and everyone loving you and everyone good with you it means you have to compromise we are not called to compromise our Hallelujah we are different species amen we don't need to find the favor of man amen and you find That's what Satan does he makes you focus he keeps your focus on building your fortune on this Earth keeps your focus on building your career on building all your friends and Families you going to be in good books to all your families be a compromiser I'm telling you now you can still be amongst your families and not be a compromise yes because the families they might not want to be around you long but when they have any when they see the spirit of Christ in you when they're going to difficult times when they're going to the problem they're going to come to you amen that same families yes will come to you they not going to go by the people they laughing and joking and having very time they're going to come by you the one that when they in need even your friends your colleagues at work when they in their desperate situations the ones that might not like you because you don't drink with them you don't you don't share the same jokes the filthy jokes that they share but when they are in Desperate situations because they recognize Christ in you they're going to come to you amen so this world needs to see a people with the Living God Amen you are the Cure amen when Jes Jesus was an earth s sorry so we constantly Satan wants to paralyze our faith so he comes subtly and he makes us focus on all these things and he wants to take us away from the straight and narrow road It's A Hard Road yes didn't Elijah said to Elisha this is a hard thing that you're asking yes didn't the prophecy come to the prophet you chose the hard the straight and narrow way it's a hard way amen but it's the right way amen amen amen is this not the right way it is amen it's the hard way but it's the right way amen it's not the popular way yes so if you want to be popular man mankind you can't choose this way yes you got to choose their way amen but if you want the unpopular way and you want to be a Oddball then you got to choose this way amen but thank God it's the right way yes Lord and it's the gateway to Heaven amen yes Lord thank you Lord amen so we find that all nature is groaning and trailing depending on us we cannot sell our Birthright yes for temporal things Esau did that yeah yeah for little soup yes he sold his but for a little uh you came from his hunting he was hungry you wanted some temporal food yes to satisfy him temporary for his anger that he had at that time he sold his birth right and you want to satisfy fleshly desires temporal things it'll satisfy you for that moment and then he brings forth death but we are supernatural beings shapped in his flesh body yes amen so when you fighting Satan you can't fight Satan under his TS amen Satan wants you to fight yes because he'll defeat you right you can't fight Supernatural demons conally you got to recognize that every circumstance that you face those natural circumstance that you face is influenced by demons seven Thunders come to awaken us to another world Amen didn't when uh josaphat and aab wanted to go to war against the Syrian Army did not uh Mah the prophet tell them what happened what transpired in the Supernatural did he not open up the supernatural to them yes they are looking at a natural W but did not M the prophet tell them what transpired in Supernatural that a lying demon that a lying Spirit come and make the prophet prophesy yes so when you seeing circumstances around you you do not tackle it amen with your natural ability yes do not tackle it Carly no matter what circumstance it is maybe you have a problem at work with your boss or with a workmate or with a family member or whatever your your children might be uh caught up in the world do not tackle it carnally yes you will be defeated carnally Satan wants you to do that but we tackle it we wrestle not against flesh and blood amen but against powers and principalities and rulers of darkness in high places amen take Satan in your territory take him up high amen amen that's where you can't defeat you amen oh yes Lord thank you Lord amen seven Thunders come to awaken as the title lead has been restored in this hour amen amen yes Adam has been restored in his hour yes to have dominion again amen hallelujah amen but up to you to use it amen it's here the word is laying here all the promises are laying here and inexhaustable Fountain of Life amen you cannot run out of God's promises am you ask God today do not feel bad to ask him tomorrow that's right amen it's up to you title lead is laying there you have dominion amen you have created Power all is laying in the word it's up to you whether you want to use it he says I was in South Africa yeah some time ago and there was a great meeting as you understood how the Lord was blessing and tens of thousands being saved and signs and wonders and swept two or three pages of P of paper everywhere every day and there was a Critic wrote me and said a letter got to me after a few days and I want to to know how it got through the management and so forth but when it got to me it said all right preacher bradam show me your company I'll tell you who you are said 90% of the peoples behind you is Pentecostal I said well praise the Lord that's right that's exactly he said 90% of the people behind your Pentecost said they believe such stuff well certainly that's where the Lord would come to where there's Believers that's the only thing that he can come to is to believer amen thank you Jes so if we speaking about the supernatural if you want to experience the supernatural then be amongst the people that believe it yes because that's where you come you will come to them that believe it oh yes them that will debate it you won't waste this time come amen but if you want to embrace it amen Embrace that this is the same God that was William brandham this is the same God that fell on the day of Pentecost this is the same Jesus yesterday today and forever let embrace it hallelujah amen and he will come to those Believers that will embrace it amen thank you now in the message the prophet Elisha he says now they cross the Jordan and they going up the yill Elisha turns around and said what would you that I do for you seeing that you've been patient to follow me from every place and own turn back you determined to go on Elisha says that's a double portion of your spirit might come upon me that's the way to ask as plenty amen amen amen so God likes to give it that way amen yes Lord you see what he saying God likes to give it in plenty yes trouble people say I ask the father so much oh my don't be scared to ask him yes ask just all you can ask yes he likes to give you just as much as you got faith to receive he own run out God's Got A Plenty a blessing hallelujah amen let's stop liting God yes because the word world needs help yes amen and sometimes the gift is not for you yes God has given us this blessing so we can give it to others amen maybe there's a family that's going to be in need yes and you're going to say such as I have I give unto you yes in the name of Jesus Christ receive your blessings amen amen Bless the people amen some of I need healing such as you have you give unto them amen because they not you you are privileged you receive this message you receive this blessing they don't have it but you are the ambassador of Jesus Christ when Jesus came on the earth he had compassion upon the people that's how he was moved when he saw the people and that's how he healed the people amen amen the prophet did the same thing he had compassion but he was abused unfortunately when he was there to leave him there day and night day and night yes eating at the ppit they abuse the gift yes but this sick world will not see Jesus Christ outside of you amen amen the sick world is crying out for Jesus Christ amen they're crying out for the Living God and the Living God is amongst us amen amen so God got a plenty of blessings our own faith you're afraid to us because you're thinking kindly now you're thinking how you operate in the natural in the natural firstly we are we have finite Minds yes we don't have infinite Minds we are fin everything we have is limited we're limited with time yes we trapped in time we are limited with finances we are limited with the things we have materially but you are a supernatural being so don't be defied by natural things yes be like David when he faced golad he didn't look at an uncircumcised golad right there he didn't look at the size of Goliath right there and he didn't look at himself as being inferior but he knew the spirit of God was upon Him amen and he knew when the anointing comes upon him what he did to the lion when the anointing comes upon him what he did to the bear and he knew now that he's going there by the Mandate of God he knew that when the anointing comes upon Him Goliath is nothing because he knew that he experienced the supernatural already Hallelujah and this natural circumstances is not going to not going to stop him amen this natural Goliath this uncircumcised natural circumstance around you is not going to stop you amen because amen you have the experience the supernatural amen praise the Lord thank you I love the way he put this one here he says could you imagine a little fish about that long out in the middle of the ocean saying I better drink of this Waters speing I might run out someday oh my that's nothing compared with what the blessings of God got for you Hallelujah could you imagine a little mouse under the great Garners of Egypt saying I just better eat a few grains each day because it might not last through the winter why he could never eat in a thousand lifetimes neither Could You observe the blessings that God's got laid up from you if you live 10 million years on here on Earth there's still a plenty of blessings for you who is the inexhaustable Fountain of Life am when you plant yourself in him by his Fountain is like the tree that's planted by the rivers of waters how glorious and how he likes to push forth His blessings to his people and give to them abundantly amen and he's been blessing us this year amen so don't think that it stopped there amen it's exhaustible so keep asking of him say Lord more of you Lord more of you lord lord I need more of you amen amen don't think he's going to stop amen he hasn't stopped what started is going to continue till we leave this earth amen amen because amen there's a quickening power available right now amen you know that quickening power was upon Elisha yes that when he was dead years and years and then they put a man there yes amen that dead man came to life amen when the dead man ch bones amen it came to life because there was so much of quickening power there amen there's so much of quickening power here that one day we're going to it's going to empty out the other dimension because because of the sons of God are coming to maturity in this hour our nature is groaning God must come and empty out that sixth Dimension and then we going to leave amen that quickening power that's when is going to change this Mortal body to immortality amen amen thank you Jesus amen Glory he says now could you imagine after that blessing being promised this young preacher how he kept his eyes right on Elijah I tell you if somebody said look over here Elijah or some noise happened over here Elisha kept his eyes right on Elijah he wanted that double portion and if you want the double portion tonight keep your eyes on Jesus amen don't pay any attention to what the devil say the devil's going to give you all your natural circumstances to say you're not fit enough he's going to bring condemnation and remind you of your past is going to remind you of your failures but you tell him there is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus and called according to his purpose amen amen so don't listen to what the devil says and what the critic says and what un what the unbeliever says keep your eyes set on Calvary saying Lord you promised it yes thank amen Jesus amen amen we are called to preach the gospel to go into all the world and preach the gospel we're not asked to go and have seminaries we're not asked to go give the people theology we asked to preach the gospel with power and demonstration amen didn't Paul say in the second Corinthians what did he say there he says in second 1 Corinthians 2:4 he says and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power yes that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men yes amen but in the power of God Amen Hallelujah that's the problem with us so as it's when natur sometimes we we we get fascinated with the way people can bring forth the word and the way they can uh show you the word the mysteries in the Bible and show you the the message in such a way and bring all these things but if that Ministry cannot produce the power and then the demonstration of the Gospel amen then you got to ask yourself if that same person they're teaching this word in that way does he know and have a personal relationship with the god of that word amen because every one of us that preach the gospel must have a personal relationship with the God of this Bible Hallelujah if we are claiming that we believe in the message of the hour in the in the in the message that William Brandon preached that we must know the god of William brandham amen we must know the god of Elijah amen I can quote to you quote after quote I can give you scripture after scripture but if I I haven't had an experience yes with the god of the scripture with the god that's behind the cods amen then I need to go have an experience and each one of us have to have our own experience that's the journey that we take amen that's why we are called The Church the called out ones he's calling us out of every system of the world yes because we come into church that means we coming to Christ amen we come to be Christlike yes we come to be partakers of his nature amen and we come to do the very works that Jesus Christ did it's a continuation yes yes if you look from the book of Acts when they continued they continued doing what Jesus did amen Jesus uh after 40 days of his resurrection he departed he ascended to heaven and he put his Spirit upon the church and they continued the same works then when the people saw them they said they recognized that they these people have been with Christ yes how did they recognize that he's been with Christ by the very works that they did amen but the very nature that they had they projected Christ in everything they did right so how people will know that we are being with Christ is by our very Works yes amen The Works that we manifest amen if we claim to experien the supernatural that it must manifest in the natural yes amen otherwise we just saying it but we're not practicing it amen amen it must operate in the natural amen when Elijah when Elisha and that the dimension open to him and he saw Elijah parting and the spirit Came Upon him he continued because when he came to receive the this side of Jordan Elijah had to part the waters so when he's going now he continued the work of elishah yes but with a double portion amen so it must be a continuation of the Gospel the gospel can't remain stagnant it the power and demonstration of the Gospel must continue until we leave this earth amen until and even when we leave the Earth do you know there's going to be a continuation of the Gospel yes it continues amen amen it goes to Moses and Elijah will be presenting the same gospel to the under 44,000 Jews amen They will receive the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that you receiv yes amen we are preaching about people that are in history now they going to speak about other as being in history and they're going to speak about God in their day amen amen so just let we speak about God in our day God working amongst us God doing the supernatural amongst us but don't be afraid ask in plenty what did the prophet say God loves that God loves it that way amen amen ask him in plenty he wants to bless you abundantly thank you Lord he said now we had plenty of passing of tracks and theology around the world but the gospel is sorry not the Bible Al together Paul said the gospel came to us not in word only yes but through Power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen yes then when Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature then he meant go into all the world and demonstrate the power of godallah to Every Creature yes that means to all mankind animal nature to everything Dominion again Amen to all creation amen yes Every Creature to have dominion again did he come and show us the first you did he come and show us what he did to kill a bull yes spoke to you amen love projected amen didn't he come and speak to the honors love projected amen amen so God has given us the same ability amen he said with power and demonstration than and in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel preach you've got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel amen the letter kill it the spirit make it alive amen because they going to come a showdown amen they'll come a showdown remember when this was it one of the Simons Simon the 10 Simon the S one of them was it was trying to cast out the spirit he saying Jesus we know Peter and Paul Peter and John we know but Peter and Paul we know but who are you yes you're going to face you're facing demon powers they say William random we know Holy Ghost men we know but who are you yes amen don't come and quote to us you can't go and quot without the without the Holy Ghost amen because you can take the the code and make a mess of the quotes there's be there's people all over YouTube doing that right now they make a mess up they misinterpreting the quotes they're confusing the people in the world yeah because they don't understand it because they don't have the Holy Ghost and you can't speak to them because they're not born again you can't explain Supernatural things to people that are not born again so they trying to take a supernatural message with they caral and try to understand it with a fine caral mind but when you are born again and you experience the supernatural then you'll understand Supernatural things amen then you begin to see this message you won't even be you won't even debate the cloud anymore because you can see why that had to happen you can see it in scripture amen if you anything in the message you must see it in the scripture if there's something that in the message that that you can't see in the scripture then I understand but what the prophet is preaching I'm talking in in terms of the opening of the word you must see it in the scripture yes any Doctrine you must see it in scripture and when you see it in scripture you see the continuity of it because the Bible is the the Bible written by different authors Yes Men filled with the Holy Ghost years apart but all is coming with the same story yes amen it's got the same story from Genesis to Revelation it's got the same theme it's a plan of God's Plan of Redemption and how God is working he's showing you the uh the shadows and Liv in the Old Testament what must happen in the New Testament amen so it's coming in a continuation the Bible is a continuation yes amen amen and this word has got so much of quickening power in it I'm telling you there's coming an hour where you're walking down the street and demons are going to flee from people you don't believe that that happen in the book of Acts amen amen yes the demon must say what what have we to do with you rather so and so or you come with the spirit of Christ what have you come here for yes why have you come to chase us way without you even saying a word that quickening power lays in you amen amen there must be so much of Christ in you that that person speaking they recognize I can't be around this person they must be such an they must be so uncomfortable that person cursing that person saying all the filthy jokes they must be uncomfortable around you all that Spirit must depart from them they must having convulsions amen yeah not long ago I was telling brother aen I think I was on the phone so uh someone came and greeted me at my office and as they they greeted me I looked at them in the eyes they left and as they left the demons are manifesting because why demons must recognize sons of God yes demons must recognize who you are yes and I told you the other incident many years ago when I first came in the message we we went up and we were called to a situation where there was this mental patient who used to be a rugby player and we had to climb up a big ladder and I recognize that this person had a demon spirit I said this people is not mental this the person not insane you think insane this is a demon spirit so the first thing I said to this person in the name of Jesus Christ hold your peace and this is what he did put his hand like this and he just got stuck on the wall yeah amen and I told the people around me this is a demon Spirit we have to tackle it in a different way they didn't listen to me they tried to tackle him naturally Carly now I told you you can't fight Satan on Satan's ground you can't fight Supernatural demon with your natural abilities and then they try to throttle this person and put him down and Tackle him down eat everyone finished every one of them the demon spirit gave them until I started binding him in the name of Jesus binding that spirit and then he started quoting The Book of Psalms quoting scripture accurately until I bound him bound him and finally restrained him so what I'm saying the prophet given illustration like that as well he spoke about this lady the man brought his wife to this place brought her down the staircase in the basement of the church there and then he went the man said he even said to the prophet don't go over there because she had so much of power ability that when they tried to even the the ambulance wouldn't bring her they had to bring her in a car and then she even had to breaking the glass in the car and she was full of Glass on her and then the first time the prophet went to her she started she put her hand out and the prophet thought he's going to talk to her but then the Spirit came started moving like a snake eing and then the prophet went and then he prayed but not long after the lady was delivered himen he met the lady again she was a normal lady with a family and everything she got delivered because the spirit Satan cannot withstand the spirit of Christ amen demon powers cannot withstand the spirit of Christ so we had all this plenty of Theology and sex around the world Amen we had plenty of giving up the message we had plenty of death message went around the world message has gone to every almost every country continent to jungles of Africa to the mountainous areas to the islands going to remote areas but what we need now in this hour to this Dying World to this world that is in Gross darkness is the power and demonstration of the Gospel amen before we leave this earth there must be an impact there must be a showdown there must be a power and demonstration of God and there's been many false prophets there's been all the false anointed ones they coming with they've been using the gifts lusting after the gifts actually but they must be the genuine amen amen prise the Lord John 14:12 he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do he shall do also and Greater Works than these shall you do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son am if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it amen did he say something no he said anything yeah in my name I will do it amen but this not for everybody this is for a son and daughter of God yes amen the scripture is not for the world yes this is John 14:12 is for those that will do the greater work that's the body amen this scripture is not for the false anointed on not this scripture this scripture is for the body of Christ because he said You shall do the Greater Works and who's doing the Greater Works it's the body of Christ amen amen Revelation 10:11 says and he said unto me thou must prophesy again for many people and Nations and tongues and Kings amen amen when elishah took the double portion anointing he had to go and complete the work of the Prophet amen he had to go on a prophetic Journey yes when you took the word of this Prophet Amen in this hour you become the prophetic voice in this hour amen how you become the prophetic voice you know what's Happ Before Time you know who the Antichrist is you know what's going to happen to all the nation you know about Daniel's prophecy you know what the word you know the Seven Seals has been revealed to you who the Antichrist spirit is who America is who is Russia in Prophecy you know what all these things that are coming upon the Earth the pestilences the famines the economic crisis nothing is nothing should be shocking to you you know that all these things must happen so you become the prophetic voice in this hour exposing Satan's schemes and his tactics that's why Paul said we not unaware of Satan's SCH amen amen he said there's Elisha Elijah was perfect type Elijah and elishah of the church and Christ now notice Elijah being the type of Christ when he went to leave before leaving he made preparation that the spirit of God must remain on the earth now God takes his man never his Spirit now God took Christ but the holy spirit yet tonight vindicating him just the same Lord Jesus he took Elijah He Came Upon Elijah Came Upon John the Baptist and The Same Spirit made Elijah act like Elijah made John the Baptist act like Elijah and he makes the church today act like Christ amen the devil takes his Spirit oh sorry the devil takes his man but never his Spirit them same teachers back there that condemned Jesus Christ they were Scholars to the minute they were far beyond our Seminary students today in the world they were holy men no one could put a hand on them they had to be holy they had to be righteous they had to be blameless but yet powered by Satan didn't recognize the Son of God and condemned and killed him that's right and the spirit lives on today people who are just as fundamental just as scholarly and teacher as they can be having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof yes the Bible said from such turn away so don't even debate with them they want to come and debate with you or message theology don't debate if they're denying the power no matter howly they might be but if they denying the power demonstration of the Gospel don't debate yes just turn away the Bible says that he says turn away brother they know the word so perfect just set it in order lay it out there in such a masterpiece trust me in our young when we first started preaching we were struck in awe at certain preaches at the way they can present the gospel in such eloquence and present the scriptures in such eloquence but they come the time where you go back to the word yourself and go see that nobody no preacher on Earth preach it like the way the prophet preach everything is laying in the message amen everything is laying in the word but when God can take a a man that will humble himself and say Lord I surrender to you yes and have the Holy Ghost he can take that same word and shine light on it amen light on it that's what the fivefold the true fivefold ministry will do take this word that already is Tau up and shine light on it make it a present word amen so it says such a master be yet know no more about God than a hoton to would know about an Egyptian KN look at the way he expresses it what he trying to say they don't have a personal experience yes am they have intellect they have wisdom yes they can take the quates and place it together in such a nice way and show you all these things they can take the scriptures but you must have a personal experience amen you must know this God of the Bible amen you and this God is a supernatural God Amen to have this experience IM me you must have time with him amen that's right only thing you know just the word the letter came the spirit give it life lives come by the word made manifest amen this Prophet had to debate big giants in his time remember he come from the Baptist background and Baptist theology and you know Baptist theologians know the word they know the scriptures but he had to tell them as a little young boy that he had met a being that he met an angel you think that was easy for him to tell them and the time where people didn't experience Divine Healing on the Earth but but if you go on further Prophet says I read a book of Wesley and Methodist who don't want to he about healing but you know Wesley when he went to pray for somebody riding his horse the horse broke his leg he Anointed The Horse oyal pray for us and he car jumped on us and he carried on Prophet said he got a book written by Wesley himself in his notes so you see people from the Ages was experiencing the gospel people who had their personal experiences amen he said oh God how we need that today with many a school and educated Scholars with many men who can tear the Bible apart and set it together in mathematics many men who can do great things in the ways of teaching who knows the Bible History to the very moment who can tell you the hour the candle was lit and the hour it went out they can tell you all these things they got the water baptism they got the spiritual baptism that they call it the robe they got everything just set in order so did Elisha but when he come down to the Jordan to face the critical world what did he cry where is the god of Elijah amen it wasn't the robe of Elijah that done it it was the power of the god of Elijah that done it amen and the thing the world Le this morning is the power of the god of Elijah yes amen you might have spoke spoke with tongues and shouted and run over the floor but what we need is the power of the god of Pentecost Amen to produce the lives and things that was lived in that day in the apostolic power a second-handed robe was all right but he needed a fresh call in his heart from God yes don't take the experience and just talk about the prophet's experiences and the prophet testim which is fine which is good we have received it we have received all of that but we need our fresh experiences amen amen amen he needed a fresh anointing from God He Wore a second-handed robe when he come to the river but when he needed a brand new first entered call from God and the first entered power from God to perform the miracle and my brother don't you be afraid to ask God anything yes yesen you must demand God yes ask God for anything that he has promised yes so you have the right to demand a promise amen if God promised it you have the right amen yes Lord for I am introducing a God that's only potent and all powerful amen and if I be a servant of God I must do the works of God and if I do the works of God I must demand of God to bring these things to pass amen because he is demanding of me to produce the impossible yes amen I have to ask him I have to call upon him and stand there and say God you promised it yes so do you every person amen so if there's a promise in the Bible you got the right to demand it of God because God is demanding of you to bring his word to pass in this hour God is demanding of you to be the final voice in the final hour God is demanding of you to be a supernatural church amen to be a super race to be an invincible Army in this hour oh God is demanding of you to be his mouthpiece in this hour God is demanding of you to be the medicine for this D and sick generation God is demanding of you to take out to speak out against sin in this generation God is demanding of you to lay hands on the sick that they shall recover God is demanding of you to to raise the dead God is demanding of you Amen to baptize people in his name amen amen that's what he's demanding of you Lord that he's going to back up his word amen amen thank you Lord just going to end this last quote he said sitting right in this building tonight I believe Mr Isaacson my finished interpreter that was there in Finland when the vision came forth and the little boy was raised from the dead laying on the side of the road which the vision was told two years before it happened and the night when 25,000 in the mesali and then turn that 25,000 out and let me speak to another 25,000 when I was going down the street there stood Russian soldiers and when I passed by a little finnished soldier trying to protect me from the crowd and get to the mesu Hal they stood with their Russian salute with tears running down running down their cheeks and they said we will receive a god like that sure a god of power but their Creed is no more than our Creeds and I seen with my own eyes Russian soldiers put their arms around finish soldiers and pet one another on the back and kiss on the side of the neck and call each other brother and any power that will make IR Russian and f one another would settle Wass forever am that is the question Christ is the answer you'll never do it by passing tracks or teaching theology it will be the power of his resurrection that will prove to them that Christ still lives amen so today what the world needs is the power and demonstration that Jesus Christ is risen from the dead and is alive forever more and that is working amongst Believers as he did in the day of Pentecost he's still doing it today amongst many member body doing the Greater Works and that's the gospel the unbeliever will come to right now when they have no hope right now and everything has every politician has let them down right now the economies have let them down right now the families have let them down right now the friends have let them down the only thing they need right now is the power and demonstration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ L amen that will turn the hearts amen so we find that these are the things that we have the potential for amen amen we have the answer you believe that am who is the answer to the world to Jesus and if we have Jesus in US Jesus is being produced through us then who has the answer it is US amen amen we have the answer to this world yes we have this answer to the sick Dying World to produce the resurrected Lord Jesus Satan is trying to offer them his kingdom he's trying to Temp them with the pleasures of his life he already paralyzed their face they have no hope they have no joy if you you look around people people have no joy that's right every news article is producing negative things every time they go to work they're getting negative things about the economy everything is failing them around them yes you speak to people in miserable but it's the holy ghost that keeps us from the gravitational amen it's only the holy ghost that keeps us same cuz outside the Holy Ghost is a neurotic man is going insanee the sick sinful world is looking for a real Church of the Living God amen amen and we have the solution for them yes but it's up to you you have been given the title deed yes you've been given every promise in his book it's up to you and say Lord I want to be the solution yes to mankind I want to be what you did on Earth amen I want to practice servanthood father amen servanthood priest then to be as king am amen priest was then King yes amen you are going to be a king because the Queen of Heaven that's that's your king kingship amen you know in the monarchs in the natural if there's no natural the king there's a queen on the throne but yeah we got a king and queen amen because we are going to be Queen in his kingdom amen thank you but right now what are you doing for mankind ask yourself what's your world your world is your workplace your neighborhood your families your world around you are you the
