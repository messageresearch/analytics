did you I know you welcome them and brother mvin and his family see all the members are coming back slowly but surely and they don't have pastors at the moment so I'll be your honorary pastor this morning amen God bless you good to see you in the house of the Lord amen welcome the family amen hallelujah amen and uh yeah we look at some of you and you gone so big been some time amen but we pray you'll be blessed in the house of the Lord amen hallelujah let's turn to our Bibles amen everybody feeling good in the house of the Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah Caleb brother jefford sister came back in the house of the Lord amen they're doing some travel and tourism but the Lord has brought them back safely amen amen hallelujah one day we'll take a flight not with a Boeing yes amen the Bible says in the twinkling of an eye in a moment of time that's what we are striving for right now right amen we don't want to miss it amen now you know this check-in time and you know you this preparation time amen hallelujah so I pray we already checked in our luggage is already in place amen and we are ready we passed the first gate yes amen wait now amen hallelujah praise the Lord I want to speak this morning on led by the angel to receive a double portion for continuation amen Exodus 23:23 led by the angel to receive a double portion for continuation amen amen so we'll turn to Exodus 23 verse 23 or start from verse 20 amen did you get my notes for the J amen praise the Lord that used to be a brother adson's job amen going back in the day now Exodus 23:20 says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared amen and then if you drop down to verse 2 three there it says for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites the I ites the perizzites the Canaanites evites and jebusites and I will cut them off yes now we see there are six ites tights and whatever there amen vites and knights now there six types man the flesh right but I want you to know in physical Israel the angel is still cutting off yes even now yes amen right now they are not called amorites ites and things they're called Palestinians amen and who's doing the cutting off oh hallelujah amen the angel of the Lord amen you may be seated the Lord bless the reading of his word amen amen if we can just put that first verse up there 20 amen that says behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way so God knows that part of the human condition is that men tend to go astray but the angel is there to keep you in the way amen this is not a broad way this is a narrow way and few want to walk in this way but the angel of God has come to keep you in the way amen amen sometimes you want to uh go off path sometimes you want to deviate from the way sometimes you may think you found a better way but I want you to know the angel of God is to keep you in the way amen amen and don't think it's impossible for message Believers to go out of the way because the prophet saw in a vision he saw the Bride of the last days stepping out of line she got out of the way and he cried out stay in line amen hallelujah so we are being led by the mighty Angel to receive a double portion for continuation amen hallelujah amen if we read the last verse part of that verse there on 20 and to bring thee into a place which I have prepared amen amen I want you to know God will not lead you to nothingness God has prepared a place for you and I to be in amen hallelujah in this prepared place you will find rest in this prepared place it's a land filled of abundance it's a land flowing with milk and honey amen Amen in this land amen he's got everything that you and I need for this life amen I want you to know the nature and the characteristics of our God when he prepares a place it's really a prepared Place amen where the enemy cannot stand amen yes amen and if God if we are so particular in our preparations for our children and our families we want the best for them how much more amen and how much more glorious and how much more marvelous God's prepared place will be amen amen hallelujah the Bible declares that the prepared place is a place where God supplies all our needs according to his witches in glory amen amen but some don't want that place amen that's Philippians 4:9 God's prepared place he supplies all our needs but you got to come to him and recognize him as Source you can't go your own way your own choosing and your own thinking and think that this is the end that life has dealt me and this this is my portion in life you need to get out of your condition the word of God tells you how to get out of your condition amen there's no reason for you to live beneath your god-given privileges Amen in My Father's House amen hallelujah he owns a cattle on a thousand years amen you need to change your thinking yes that's right amen that's where it all starts you change your thinking here amen amen God's prepared place we know is Malachi 45 and 6 amen what is that turning our heart back to the faith of the fathers God's prepared places Revelation 10 what is that revealing the mystery of God you see the entire chapter I say yes the entire chapter is revealing the mystery of God but it's a hidden Mystery amen I know some of you didn't catch that I said the entire chapter of Revelation 10 is revealing the mystery of God you say but from verse 8 it deals with me yes you are revealing the mystery of God yes that's right right get it amen it's fine amen it's not meant for everybody it's meant for certain people when you realize you are expressing the mystery of God Amen you walk in step with the word of God Amen someone to shun it away because they are too afraid of the anointing of God they are too afraid of the Holy Ghost they are too afraid that will make them act a little bit radical amen make you raise your hand and shout hallelujah Make You Dance in the spirit amen make you get drunk in the spirit prise amen hallelujah we got too many watered down religion amen too many polished up religion amen but what we need is an oldfashioned Pentecostal experience yes Lord amen God prepared place for the believer in this time God has certain Seasons a lotted and he didn't open up certain Seasons to different people Mark 11:23 wasn't opened up to Luther neither was it opened up to Wesley neither was it opened up to zza Street Revival but Mark 11:23 was opened up to the the prophet of this age amen and we are a continuation of that message what is Mark 11:23 a call for man to return to the power of the spoken word oh yes that's God's prepared Place amen I'm still dealing with the prepared Place amen hallelujah God's prepared Place amen he the place where all things are possible that's Mark 9:23 but it's a place where you need belief if thou can't believe then all things are possible amen people can't believe God for a truth AE amen how you going to believe all things are possible amen hallelujah amen a prepared place for us is Romans 8:23 amen a call for sons and daughters amen all creation is calling all creation is groaning it's a call for Sons and Daughters to do what Amen to come back to their true position and their true identity that's right but some are ignoring creation's call amen some are satisfied with what Satan has to offer in Eden in his Eden amen hallelujah didn't Jesus tell us in in John 14:12 14:2 in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you oh this is now a preparation out of this world amen amen those scriptures we dealt with right now we're dealing with your preparation in this life but Jesus in his parting sermon to them before he goes to the Cross he's telling them I am making preparations in heaven for you yes yes amen right now my Plan of Redemption is for you to come back to glorification amen but you're in a flesh body and there's no way for you Amen to get back there you bypass your theophany so I'm preparing a place for you to get back to your theophany body amen yes Lord thank you Lord amen so God Jesus is saying I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also amen yes how many if you want to be where Jesus is amen amen hallelujah the Bible even declares that even now we are seated together in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus amen amen hallelujah amen glory be to his name so I want you to know that continuation what is continuation amen it's continuing something or a prolongation of a state or activity or it's a resumption after an interruption right if you look at the seven Church ages even though there were interruptions there was continuity yes amen amen even though they denominated and stopped the continuity there was disruptions everybody following my thought when the next messenger took off there was continuity yes amen they didn't have to start back yes amen there is continuity how many of you know there ought to be continuity in our life we call it growth amen if we are not growing there's something wrong you know what stagnant water is yes what happens with stagnant water brother the raes T Tad PES and you're getting worms and you're getting the water contaminated amen there shouldn't be stagnation in a believer's life the Bible says we go from glory to glory amen if you are stagnated if you are remaining still then something is wrong with your walk with the Lord then you are not being led by the angel amen yes amen hallelujah now continuation as says requires consecration yes amen consecration a consecrated life a holy life yeah we need a call back to prayer amen we need a call back to reading the Bible yes amen amen amen we have some very good Catholic message people who only want the priest to read the Bible a better do here amen people want me to be like a Catholic priest you want me to come with a white collar here and read the Bible say three ill mares you want religion amen for example if I ask you it's been 12 months gone this year did you at least listen to 12 sermons amen of of the Vindicated Prophet your Prophet amen now know that's not something that everybody's readily going to answer right now but I ask you to do introspection don't look and see I'm going to sit back now after the service and see how much money I made the whole year I'm going to count how much money and see if I was successful this year measure your success according to the word amen amen hallelujah that's right amen amen you see if we do introspection and we really check how many hours did we spend in prayer how many hours did we spend reading the word yes how many hours did we surrender to the Holy Spirit but now you see I don't know if Netflix can tell you the amount of hours you spent watching that maybe your phone can tell you how many hours you spent on it you see we can measure these things but if we if we really want to progress if we really want to be led by the angel for continuation for a double portion you see the this double portion thing is not a buzz word yes it's not a catchphrase yes we realize that we need this power amen amen to make it out of here without it we are not going that's right amen we are the continuation of William bram's Ministry the ministry of William brandham is not dead amen he was the elah we are the Elisha come on now I need more people to connect with that amen you are not called here to come and say that God sent us a prophet God sent us a prophet and that's where it stops amen amen that's right amen I want to pick up the story here in 1 Samuel chapter 1 and I want to take the story of Alena and Anna now Alena had two wives and you read there in the story that panina had two children and this man alkaa was from the tribe of ephraimite and you know the Ephraim where Ephraim is from whose son is he Joseph he's Joseph son right so alen is Joseph's son if I can say it this way this is Joseph reproduced amen but he comes now and panana has children but an has no children now I want you to learn a few things from the story and see amen what we can learn out of this it says here year after year Alena would go up from his City to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts at Shiloh notice consecration where Eli's two sons opne and Phineas were Priests of the Lord and whenever they came the day came for for Alena to present his sacrifice he would give portion to his wife pan and to all his sons and daughters but to Anna he would give a double portion amen amen yes thank you thank you hello amen somebody is receiving a double portion amen yes amen amen let's go on further then we'll talk about it amen why was he giving a double portion for he loved her even though how many if you know people who can't have children the only reason why they can't have children is because of this yes what is the Bible saying oh no but in my biological makeup they tell me that I have a certain condition that is why I can't have children who closes HS who open Sarah's home who open Elizabeth's home who open Rebecca's home amen yes Lord wonderful thank you amen don't see some people rely too much on science believe me if they had a sonogram and things here they wouldn't have been able to help Anna in any way the Lord closed the wom if they try to do what this thing where they can help you artificial in semination and all of these things if God shuts the home he shuts the wom so if God has given you children you ought to be grateful to the Lord and give him praise amen there are many people who can't have children amen I'm going to show you the Lord reiterates us amen so yeah the Lord Clos him then verse 6 because the Lord had closed Anna's Home a rival would provoke her and taunt her viciously now my point of bringing this can you be a person married to Jesus Christ with a double portion anointing amen and not reproducing his life oh yes thank you Lord hallelujah that's what I want you to get from the story everyone can say I'm the wife I'm the bride of Christ yeah you're the bride of Christ congratulations on your marriage we'll send you a wedding gift congratulations you married to Jesus Christ you went to Home Affairs and you changed your ID you show everyone I'm Mrs Lord Jesus Christ he's giving you double portion anointings amen amen but you're walking around like Anna your home is closed no life no fruit yes you do nothing with the message you do nothing for people you do nothing for no one but you know BR I was reading here and the Bible the prophet says eternal life is living for others e you're like a schizophrenia person you only live for yourself and you saying you're living for others that's why I'm saying you got schizophrenia you're actually living for yourself but you're thinking you're living for another person selfish but the prophet says eternal life is living for others amen amen praise the Lord so don't be that person now walking hearing about the double portion anointing but no life no fruit no Works nothing dry Barren unfruitful amen but let's go on Amen so here we find amen that this went on year after year whenever Anna went up to the house of the Lord a rival taunted her until she wept and would not eat now the husband ask her Anna why are you crying remember doesn't sound familiar now was Elisha asking people what can I do for you what can I do for you this is a man who's giving her double portions why are you crying amen just so you know that this man man's name means God has created but he has not witnessed a creative power yet the the name Al in Hebrew means God has created but you know your name represents your character your nature and something God's going to do in your life God's about to do a creative power amen a creative of power miracle in his wife so he's got the right name Adam means favor or Grace amen amen she's walking around with the name Grace favor but notice the Bible is giving you Clues there but maybe we are missing it he's saying year after year she went she continually went amen she never stopped her altar she never stopped stopped worshiping she never stopped amen coming before the Lord with a supplication maybe things didn't happen for us this year and we are disgruntle nothing worked out for me this year watch your heart condition Beyond expectation for you know not when the angel of God will move yes sir it may be midnight to midday and never early never late yes is going to stand by what he says amen I lived enough life to say Al is on the way he could come at the last minute amen amen tonight when you're looking there 23 59 is when he could come amen you remember he came 4 days late yes he came 4 days later at the grave of Lazarus amen had he come 2 days early it wouldn't have been the will of God why Lazarus was sick un death what would Jesus have done Jesus would have healed him but according to the vision which God has showed him he wasn't going to heal laus he was going to raise him from the dead amen so he had to prolong and he had to delay in order for Lazarus to be dead stinking buried yes so God knows what plan he has written for our lives amen and he coming according just on time amen hallelujah so notice she's she's going in still to worship to pray going to the house of the Lord she never stops coming to church amen amen she never stops worshiping the Lord amen she's got the right attitude she's creating the right atmosphere amen amen you know atmosphere is what it takes for the angel of God to move amen all of us are creators of an atmosphere amen hallelujah amen why are you crying Anna why won't you eat why is your heart so grieved am I not better to you than 10 Sons so after they had finished eating amen so here we find after they had finished eating and drinking in shoh Anna stood up now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by by the doorpost of the Temple of the Lord in a bitter distress Anna prayed to the Lord and wept with many tears and she made a vow pleading oh lord of host if only you will look upon the Affliction of your maid servant and remember me not forgetting your maid servant by but giving her a son then I will dedicate him to the Lord all the days of his life and no razor shall ever come over his head as Anna kept on praying before the Lord Eli watched her mouth now notice she moved from crying because crying will do nothing from you to you for you what did we learn this year you must speak so even if you're crying use some words yes because the power of the spoken word lies in your You Must Believe in Your Heart confess with your if you say to this mountain if you think to the mountain what did Jesus say in Mark 11:23 if you pray to the mountain if you pray to the father and tell the father to move the mountain does it say pray or say brother put it up amen help somebody amen what is Mark 11:23 saying it is saying if you pray to the mountain or if you pray to the father verily verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain amen [Music] amen be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart yes but believe those things which he had said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen amen so that's where man got away from that's where Adam fell from Adam disbelieved his own word so when Jesus curses the Fig Tre you know the Bible if you if you go back to your scripture maybe go into the uh Bible app then amen if you go into that scripture you'll see that Jesus curses the victory amen amen amen why was it so you know Jesus could have used his power in many ways the same power he used to curse the Fig Tre he could have used the power to speak fruit on the tree everybody understanding amen he could have said bear forth fruit but Jesus already set the law back in Genesis that every seed must bring forth of its kind amen amen so God is under expectation for you to bring forth fruit in your life so he's walking to this fig tree and a fig tree having leaves now if you know about a fig tree when a fig tree has leaves it means it's got fruit so Jesus looking a far at this fig tree he comes to the Fig Tree thinking he's got fruit and he came and he found nothing but leaves for the time of fig was not yet right and Jesus answered and said unto it now why will you answer someone if that thing is not talking to you if you talk to something what they say you are you go talk to a tree they'll say you're mad but the tree is talking to Jesus now some of you don't know what I'm talking about I'm going to simplify it for you every time you pick up your light bull your water bu your deps isn't it talking to you it's talking to you what is it saying CA right learn principles now this is not a sermon this is for you to apply in your life so whatever he's talking to you you need to talk back to it Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee here after forever and his disciples heard it amen right so we know that Jesus goes back to the temple he goes for a time of consecration he has consecration again he goes to the temple to consecrate them consecrate the temple and then he comes back the next day right let's move up 20 maybe go to 20 right and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots next verse Peter calling to remembrance said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thy curse is withered away what is Peter really saying here Lord tell us how you did it Peter wants to to learn he's calling his attention to the Fig Tree because he wants to learn how he did it and here is what Jesus is saying Jesus said unto them have faith in God Amen now if you look at that translation the faith this is Galatians 2:20 now it says the faith that I have is the faith of the Son of God so he's telling you you need to have the faith of God everyone following amen because why I'm saying this is very important for you to understand the verse now when it says whosoever that whosoever is only those that are operating in the faith of God Amen it's not any Tom diary yes amen you must have the faith of God oh yes and now we go to the next verse in order for that whosoever to operate amen wonderful amen amen now whosoever shall say to your electricity bill whosoever shall say unto your water bill that this de shall be clear whosoever shall say to your debt whosoever shall say to your demon possessed child yes whosoever shall say to your sick child amen whosoever shall say unto your Mountain amen amen amen for verily I say unto you that your pastor shall speak to your Mountain call the Deacon to speak to your Mountain remember we are not lians here we haven't come to conquer the Ley we have come to put the power back in the people amen that's what the message Church come to do the message of the hour is come to put the bow back in the people oh yes God Amen whosoever are you or whosoever the one that has the faith of God I want you to speak to your Mountain yes you say it might be the 11th hour it's too late it's the 31st it's never too late God don't work according to the Gregorian calendar yes ah but it's the last year of 2023 I was enjoying this year I was speaking to Autumn this morning I said you're excited for the last day of the year she said I'm excited but I'm also sad I like the year 2023 now I want I want you to always remember this year for those of you that have been in the church since the beginning of the year I want you to always remember this year because if I can summarize it for you it's the year the angel came to us amen yes Lord thank you yes so never ever forget it brother Grandma never forgot 1946 you never forget it amen but he's leading Us in continuation now along this year did we pick up about the double portion what's he doing the angel is leading us in a double portion anointing for the continuation of the Greater Works amen amen so I was telling you that Anna's mouth was moving you got to speak to your situation don't think to your situation and never speak negative about your situation you see that thing there you will go and tell and confess everything amen hallelujah amen you going tell everybody who you're owing and what you owing you tell everyone my debt are clear hello yes you tell everyone I'm Deb free amen amen you say I'm lying you're not lying you're speaking by faith hallelujah amen I I wish everyone would catch you this morning morning don't go speak and tell negativity amen hallelujah God's prepared place is a place of healing God's prepared place is Mark 16 yes these sign shall follow them that believe if they lay hands upon the sick they shall recover some of you in your Christian walk you've been in your Christian walk 20 years you've never laid your hands upon anyone because you don't believe Mark 16 you don't believe the power layes within you that the Holy Ghost power the anointing lays within you that you have power within you to pray and call on the power of Goden yes Lord amen what we have is Wishy washing message Believers amen confessing proclaiming a truth but have no power no life amen hallelujah we need to move it out of our thinking and into our mouths we need to move to speaking amen tell everyone my problem tell everyone this tell everyone that amen I was telling you if your husband is drinking if your husband is smoking every time you see them drinking say Lord I thank you Father they are drinking the precious blood of Jesus Christ and that blood is cleansing them and making them old and bringing Deliverance to their body yes now the woman who saved a husband remember she lived the life yes even though he threw eggs on the wall I if you tried throwing eggs on the wall this year to test the character of your wife no one amen so this woman you remember he said I'll show you a true Christian so he went home acted more drunk than he really was when she prepared eggs for him she took the eggs and threw it on the wall said I don't want like the eggs this way she says no problem honey I'll go prepare eggs the way you like it amen comes back prepares the eggs she's singing must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free she didn't run everywhere and say you better call the police say where I'm going to finish this fellow here now you see that plate that plate didn't break watch I'm going to crack it on his head she didn't go around telling everyone a problem that's what I'm trying to tell you amen amen amen because life and death are in the power of the tongue and they that love it will eat the fruit thereof so if you love negativity keep speaking negativity you'll live in the fruit of negativity some of you have got Orchards of negativity yeah you call everyone hey come see my Orchard here negativity and you got one dry prune of positivity

going into the shell I see like tortoises here now torus shells amen come back out amen the fire of God will bring you back outen amen hallelujah how many of you want to carry your old ways into the new year Christian people are saying hey you know what I don't like that saying it turn you some of you need to turn new leaves some people need to turn your leaves hey some of us need to make a change amen let me tell you if you don't if you don't connect now with the Angel's message there are going to be illegal spirits that attach to you that's right am amen so you know there let's go otherwi we'll never get Hannah giving birth to a baby here Amen Hallelujah Anna was praying in her heart and though her lips were moving amen a voice so she first started to speak and then she started to continually speak right so Eli thought she was drunk and said how long will you be drunk put away your wine no my Lord I am a woman oppressed in the spirit and I have not had any wine or strong drink but I have poured out my soul before the Lord consecration amen amen there's whole another sermon on this year how to get your deliverance how to get what you need amen do not take your servant from for a wicked woman for all this time I've been praying out of the depth of my anguish and grief now Eli says go in peace and may the god of Israel Grant the petition you have asked of him may your M servant find favor with you said Anna and then she went out of way and she began eating again and her face was no longer downcast the next morning alen Anna got up early to bow in worship you see they never stopped then oh my and returned home and alen had relations with his wife Anna and the Lord remembered her so in the course of time Anna conceived and gave birth to his son and she named him Samuel because I have asked for him from the Lord amen now I want to summarize this and tell you that the double portion that Anna received is to reproduce the life amen amen why did Elisha want to double portion very quickly now nobody wants to I'm closing soon as you say closing everyone's like yo about time why did Elisha want a double portion to reproduce the life of Elijah come yes why amen why did he want a double portion to reproduce the life of Elijah amen so Anna having received a double portion but she wanted to re she didn't want the double portion alone she wanted to reproduce the life of Alena yes amen somebody raise the hand who wants to receive this say Lord I Thank you for a double portion amen but I want to reproduce your life Lord amen than Lord we find Moses was one portion but Joshua was a double portion right and how does Joshua 1 and8 start it says the book of the law shall not depart from your bookshelf the book of the law shall not depart from your tablet we will not depart from you it comes back to speaking amen they had to speak the word but thou sht meditate day and night yes thou May observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shall make thy way prosperous keys to success right here walk unemployed but keep the word in your mouth and watch yourself become employed yes sir amen what walk broke but keep your mouth with the word of God meditate on it day and night and walk out of your broke situation come on walk sick but keep the word in your mouth and you shall walk into your healing yes Lord amen in whatever situation you find yourself in meditate on the word of God day and night in order for you to get your deliverance yes come on not a casual thing when I think about it oh Lord I remember I wrot beginning of the year I forgot where I left that page even I wrote my vision beginning of the year but during the year the television got involved in my vision that's right you missed out because you love action you love action movies the fellow was shooting everyone he got paid millions and you still broke you made him more Rich got a cut from the streams hey so Moses was one anointing Joshua was another anointing but what you shall make your way prosperous and then you shall have good success amen Malachi 4:5 and 6 what does it say it talks about two Elijah there for those of you know that message of the hour but there's a continuity there's one Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and there's another Elijah a continuation to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers there's a double portion scripture there who's leading them Eli amen the angel of God the angel of God didn't come down in the days of Luther the angel of God didn't come down in the days of Wesley neither did it come down in the zza street but the angel of God came down in 1963 amen the word was kept for a specific time yes right and there's the people that will fulfill that scripture amen who's the you behold I send you yes that's you yes that's right that's me William brandom is coming for me to turn my heart back to the faith of the fathers that's where you must read that scripture amen hallelujah so there must be continuity in your life that's what the angel of God has come to give us a double portion for to lead us into a life of continuity continuity of what continuity of that first church continuity of the Greater Works amen people like Abraham believe God Amen how many of you know Abraham believed God does the Bible say Abraham believed God yes and it was counted unto him for righteousness didn't they tell amen our lord Jesus says you believe in God believe also in me amen now Christ is in his body so the body has to say you believe in Jesus believe also in me but you see you don't see the mystery of God there but before other people can believe in you You Must Believe In what the word says about you as long as you don't see your in the word if Jesus never saw himself in the word he wouldn't have been able to do what he did Jesus knew what the word said about him Amen Hallelujah Jesus now in St John 14:12 here's the continuity now verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because because I go to my father amen and whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it did Brother Bram have continuity in his ministry yes he was led by the angel of God for continuity in his ministry he was not stagnant amen from the first pool he moved to the second pool from the second pool he moved to the third pool amen amen each anointing was greater amen amen if if you were had a greater anointing when you first came to the knowledge of the truth something is wrong with your walk hello if you had the greatest Revelation when you first came to the knowledge of the message of the hour something is wrong with your walk you are not being led by the angel forward you are being pulled by the devil backwards hey I try to be a nice preacher but amen the amen when the spirit of God speaks amen hallelujah we got to cut everything out of the way amen we are not here on a picnic we are here to prepare people for the Rapture amen Revelation 10 was telling you happened in 1963 and here is a twofold part yes amen here's your double portion right here amen amen the angel coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud rainbow above his head face as it were the sun feet as pillars of fire amen I need to show you if you don't know it this is the actual picture of the angel of God coming down had in his a little book open set his right foot upon the sea left foot on the earth cried with a loud voice lion roars seven Thunders utter their voices amen hallelujah now in verse 7 you know it says there but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall began to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servant the prophets yes amen amen so William brandom is to reveal the mystery of God and when he reveals the mystery of God our eyes become open and we realize that we are part of the mystery of God because it's Christ in me the hope of glory all that was in God he into Christ and all that was in Christ he pour into his church amen yes so you can't separate us from the mystery of God that is why there's a continuation now after verse 7 to continue I'm telling you the angel is leading us in a double portion anointing for continuation amen all the way to verse 8 for many years people refused to move to verse 8 but the angel of God came in a specific time and season and says move on into verse 8 recognize your time recognize your season recognize what you are called for yes amen amen people were afraid to go amen The Voice calls from heaven and saying go take the little book which is in the hand of the Angel who stands on the land on the sea amen you need to say give me the little book have a convers ation with the angel take the book and eat it up amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations amen hallelujah what the prophet of God is saying Elijah or Micaiah was with the word because the word had pronounced cursings on their thing talking about aab now and how could Mah say anything else but stay with that word so staying with the word God showed him a continuation of the word amen you see because we stayed with William brandom's message God is showing us a continuation amen come on now we are not leaving William bram's message because we stayed with the prophet and his word God is showing us the continuation how many of you want to see the continuation amen think of the woman out the well who whoever drinks of this water Drinker of this water if you notice it wasn't just take a drink and walk walk away and forget about it it's drinketh that's continuation oh yes but whosoever drink it of this water that I shall give him shall never thirst amen can somebody tell me what that water is amen tell me what that water is come on now hey what is that water who soever shall drink of this water shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him amen it's the Holy Ghost and Fire that is keeping me alive keeping me alive some people got the Holy Ghost as a pit in a cage but the Holy Ghost needs to be in you out of you shall flow amen rivers of Living Waters Holy Ghost within you amen Holy Ghost Fire come and burn out everything amen man that's continuation whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him and he shall never thirst I want you to know that this woman at the well for those of you who ever sit and think about things even though she ran into the city to say come see a man told me things I have done you know she had to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost she would never make it to Heaven yes amen you know we read all the stories in the Bible the woman with the issue of blood yeah she got a healing the man that was at the temple man got his healing but every one of them if they wanted to make it on the other side what they needed to do they needed to get to the upper room they needed to be baptized you know we automatically think when we read the Bible hey because they were healed they were saved who said you can be healed today and your healing can be gone tomorrow you can be healed of one thing today tomorrow you get another sickness so it's salvation of the Soul that's most important amen some people don't like what I'm saying amen cuz you don't agree with what I'm saying why in the Bible does he tell you they were saved they were healed yes why did Paul find it necessary to find John's converts and tell them how are you baptized yes that's right reveal the baptism to them and they had to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen amen amen let's just close with this quote here let me show you another reason why Satan hates the Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Satan knows that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own amen yes thank you some Wish It Was Written like this Satan knows that assuredly that the Messi's church with all the revelations and no power in the church is the true church Listen to What a prophet is telling you Satan knows Satan knows that the original Church of Pentecost for the the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is it has to be amen now this is where I got this continuation from now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen continuation is not start over continue means continue for those of you young people play games you know and you put the game on pause how many if you go back to start you continue from where you started everybody agree nobody wants submit to playing games now but it's fine amen you put it on pause and then you continue sometimes in these games you got to have credit because even if you die you can resurrect back to life and continue from where you were so I said even though you were dead the whole year I'm giving you some coins this morning am to put in the machine and join us in a journey from 23 to 24 give God Hand of Praise amen praise the Lord let's Stand Together hallelujah amen you know you know in life there are certain things that you always remember amen something somebody says or somebody did or something I remember when I first started preaching and that time brother was around and I was telling him hey you know me I like a message of the hour right for those of you who thought I preached two hours I just preached one hour I actually got 2 minutes to spit so I remember something he told me which always stuck with me he says if you keep your notes to four pages you'll be okay so I've always remembered that and that's why I have a four-page not sh amen hallelujah let's give God a hand clap of Praise amen hallelujah praise the Lord so if you ever here I got six pages or eight pages you must know with there's a double portion coming your way amen hallelujah amen how many you love the Lord amen we are led by the angel of the God by the angel of the lord we have received a double portion but we need to continue he's leading us not to go backwards now yes remember it's going to go from glory to glory amen amen I really need some of you to be spiritual right now amen I really need you to be religious right now because you need to be so desperate for his glory yes you need
