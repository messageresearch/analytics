name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ once again it's good to be found in the house of God Amen before I go to that scripture let me thank you Lord the Book of Genesis 9:14 says and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the Earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud Revelation 101 says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven fled with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head in his face as it wear the Sun and his feet as PS of fire amen man you may be healed also turn to Isaiah 11:10 and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ins sign of the people to it shall the Gentile seek and his rest shall be glorious Psalm 64 says thou has given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth amen amen amen so tonight we're going to speak a little sermon that a continuation of Sunday's meeting if you call the inspiration on Sunday amen we're going to speak on the end sign and the banner displayed by the bride of Christ amen amen so we know that when God gave his Covenant to Noah what speaks about in Genesis amen and then we see in Revelation 10 he shows his Banner on display amen amen but remember now every time he's giving a covenant a rainbow is displayed amen amen so every time he's meeting his Prophet even when the prophet is going on his hunting and he's and he's having a supernatural experience he sees the rainbow amen you know the story of the storm and so forth so but this Prophet was hunting a rainbow trout yes amen and he's fishing but she's not coming under the first two pools it was the third pool that caught attention amen yes it was the third pool that catches this rainbow trout yes because she's associated with this Covenant amen amen and the purpose of that that Covenant give to knowah about Father's bride yes amen because in this Covenant because remember God destroyed that Earth in the days of Noah that world sorry that world in the days of Noah and then over on to this world now when Noah is coming to this world he gives him a covenant and he say when you see this bow again amen you must that is Covenant yes and there it's on display again in Revelation 10 amen but this time it's coming with a title Deeds because there's going to be a people that's is going to go back to the original condition yes that title was that was forfeit is these people are going to go back to the original condition but this people is a covenant people yes amen therefore the prophet calls them the rainbow trouts and when he's fishing and he's putting the bait the purpose of the bait is catching other fishes not C to catch the other fishes but the bait is catching the other fishes but under the third pool amen comes forth the rainbow trouts yes amen because in the last days there must be an end sign again yes and the banner must be displayed again but this time the banner must be displayed to the bride of Christ yes amen and we know that that Banner was displayed in Jesus Christ that Banner was displayed to the prophets but it must come again because there's a covenant amen and this Covenant is a i word covenant yes hallelujah amen this Covenant is Not By Any man amen but it's by God Amen so we find that the end sign and the banner displayed by the bride of Christ in his last days amen we know Sunday's message the pastor Adan was preaching about how a banner is a visible is a standard raised amen amen is a standard rais to Rally people amen like in a time of War amen and it signifying identity and Authority amen amen so when this Banner was displayed in this time in Revelation 101 it was giving us our true identification yes amen amen and when the title of the book comes down is now giving us the authority amen amen that's why the scripture says Thou must prophesy again yes amen because there's names in the book yes right and there's a people that's given an identity recognizing that they have the DNA of God that they are Sons and Daughters of God through spiritual Amnesia they for they didn't realize the true identity they were strapped in the chicken bards but the identity were of the eagle nature it was an Heavenly identity it wasn't an Earthly identity amen amen but your identity that you knew was because to the sex birth brought to an Earthly body to a flesh body a temporary body you recognize that identity all the days of your life until the day Revelation suck you amen amen but when Revelation struck you your life began to change amen because why it was the transforming power of the word that you be not conformed any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind because now the mind is the betterle ground the mind is no man's land the the the thing that you was craving for the thing that you was always feeling for that was of God but Satan come to play that part of the mind and he give you other things to satisfy your needs yes but those are only temporary satisfaction amen God wants to redeem you from this Earthly nature because you're an Heavenly being amen you are part of him you come from God and you have to go back to God so you got to be the ins sign in this hour and you got to raise the banner in his hour amen amen thank you Lord amen Isaiah 11:10 says in in Isaiah 10 1110 he says we know Isaiah is speaking of Christ as the root of Jesse and he he he's the one would stand as an end sign for the people yeah so we know that scripture is drawing reference to Jesus Christ amen amen because Jesus Christ is the key amen yes he is the image yes and when Christ is on display that's the image we attain to be amen amen because why he was the first born of the new creation yes amen amen amen because he come to deliver you from being in a fallen condition he come to deliver you from being Hur bounden amen we know the prophet of God always emphasize that Christ is a fulfillment of that prophecy yes amen and Christ is the the point of where we as Believers where the elected must be gathered yes and who is Christ Christ is the words and he stands at the as the sign of God's salvation to mankind yes and we are gathered to him amen which is the words so who remains the central focus is always Christ amen amen amen and he is the one in whom the bride must be fully identified we must be identified in Christ it's always the identified Christ in all ages yes so we must be fully identified with Christ and when Christ was on he identif identified himself as the Son of God yes and that's why the Jews sought to kill him yes because he made himself God so if you identified with Christ then what DNA you got amen what power you possess amen so we know the inside is Christ so the bride will be nothing short of Christ because if we come he said many have come to me in that day said Lord have I not prophesied in Your Name Lord have not cast out demons in your name he said depart from me workers of iniquity I know you not this bride must come into Oneness with him his father he said father may they be one even as we are one amen there must be such a oness like how he said he said I've been so long with you Philip and you have not known me yes you have seen me you have seen the father so if the people see you they must see Christ when people have a thirst and anger and crying out for Christ in this dying generation in this generation of gross darkness when they see you they must see Christ the anointed one in this hour amen the anointed people in this hour hallelujah amen yes and that must be the that must be raised amen when you are gathered to him the reveal word in this [Music] hour so we are the ones that are we have the banner of Truth displayed yes nobody else has the banner of truth yes there is no half truths in the gospel amen that's right people might have certain uh fundamental knowledge of the Gospel yes but there is no truth yes all the world has been revealed in this hour amen the seals have been broke the book is opened amen hallelujah nothing is left out yes amen so we are Jesus said the truth shall set you free the word is Tru amen amen so if you are so people are in bondage in this world the reason why they are in bondage the reason why people are have hostage in this world by Satan's domain is because they don't have truths amen but the only thing that can set them free is the truth amen but the bride has that Banner amen and she has to raise that Banner amen yes Psalm 64 says thou has given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth amen amen so here's P speaking about God is giving a banner to those that fear Him yes and he displayed because of Truth amen so the bride is also given a banner to wave in his last days yes representing the truth of God's word thank you Lord It's undiluted unpolluted amen amen which she doesn't compromise with the word she holds a banner of Truth High yes she's not going to deny any word amen while the word is while the world is drifting away into confusion while they given into false doctrines while they compromising with the world the bride holds firm and holds the word of God in its purity amen and that's why it's a declaration that she stands for the full revelation of Christ in this hour because she is the mar priest of Jesus Christ amen she's going to be the standard raised in his hour amen I'm not talking about written word I'm talking about a manifested word amen the standard that is raised is the manifestation of the word Upon A people amen thank you Lord amen there must be a manifestation of the word but he has a role to play amen he says yeah yeah it is after he going away he said I will not leave you comfortless I'll give you another ins sign yes if I be lifted from the earth I'll draw all men unto me and the things that I do shall you do even greater than this John 14:12 for I go unto my father and he commissioned human beings to go all the world and preach the gospel amen and demonstrates see what he say he's not just talking about preaching as in talking but he's talking about also demonstration now and demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost until when until the days of William Brenham no he says until he returns amen as a sign yes is God's provided sacrifice tonight is the person of the Lord Jesus in the person of the Holy Spirit here tonight proving himself to be Jehovah Gyra yes the Lord's provided sacrifice for your healing tonight amen the person of the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ returning in spirit form he said I come from the father I go to the father a little while and the world will see me no more yet you shall see me for I will be with you even in you Amen to the end of the world yes amen so there's no question there's no there's no stop there there's no full stop there amen it's until the Jesus comes again amen yes and takes away his bride so there must be an end time position for the bride amen there must be a a bride position in this end time what is that position it must be one of being fully identified with the word yes yes and not swayed Away by any modern systems by any religious Creeds by this Earthly any Earthly movements any legy and spirits that are going around but must remain true to the original words yes and then the bride can stand now in full Authority amen like how a army will stand like a military amen amen how do a military will stand in full array Ready for War yeah full array with all the weapons in full uniform amen because right now it's a Battlefront the enemy wants you to surrender the enemy wants you to retreat right and cause the peace treaty while he's got your brethren in hostages while he's holding your brother and sisters down in bondage yes he wants you to retreat because why he wants to get reinforcements he wants to arm himself more and bind them more but we are not a army that will surrender amen amen we har that will Retreat amen yes until that last one comes in the battle will continue just like Joshua said stand stand still until we defeat we utterly slay and destroy the enemy yes amen yes until we are here on the earth we will continue the battle amen amen there will be no time to rest because the battle must go on yes as long as the last one has not come in as long as people are still been backed and condition as long as brothers and sisters are still bound we will continue the battle amen amen we will continue raising the banner amen cuz we are showing that our true Allegiance is to Christ Our Allegiance is to the lamb amen amen not to this world system the kingdoms of this world are falling apart Daniel's prophecy is being fulfilled in amen amen Isaiah 62:10 says go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a standard for the people yes amen now we know that the bride has to be the standard Bearer for the gospel yes that's why he said the church is no longer God's mouthpiece the church world yes but the bride will be his mouthpiece amen she'll be with the one that will speak for him in his hour because why she is the body of Christ yes amen so she has to Bear she has to be the standard bearer of the Gospel nobody else can claim to be Christians in this hour nobody else can have claim to say that they are have the standard they are the standard bearer of the Gospel do you hear what I'm saying amen is only with the brides she has the only she's the only one with the authority that's why you can say she is the final voice the final age because she's come under a messenger they rejected the messenger they miss the key of the age they cannot become the final voice amen yes that's why she has the standard in this hour that's why we are the call out group and there's a responsibility on us to live this can die amen amen amen there's a responsibility in is hour you know Jesus gave the illustration of the man with with talents yes in Matthew 25 he's speaking about giving them talents amen yes because what he was trying to show you that he left them with a responsibility amen amen that they own sh in that hour the Bible much is given much is requ required so we find that the world will not will now know Christ how by seeing his reflection in the bride yes the very image she must come to that image amen she must be in that image in such a manner that when they look at her they will be so astonished at this people yes you might look like every other human being but I'm talking about when you are now speaking in Authority I'm not talking about your normal everyday conversation now you know what I'm talking about under that anointing and under when you are facing a challenge or somebody is facing a challenge and you are before them and you recognize demon powers or you recognize the need for the day and you are facing the challenge but you are now speaking as one with authority yes amen that's right you understand what I'm trying to say Amen we are living we are in this world but we are not of this world in other words in this world we be like normal c times but there's certain times when the anointing comes on us there's a certain times where we got to now pull our shoulders together we got to stand firm and recognize who we are and recognize what we displaying amen amen we got to face the Enemy by being courageous yes amen we we can't be the one that being afraid of the enemy we got to be courageous in this hour you got to run towards the enemy not run away from the enemy am amen when David fac gol R towards him amen so there's a responsibility Shing is running away from your responsibility yes but if you have responsibility you face the enemy amen so we find that in this hour we are we are called out to have this high standard amen yes and therefore the the word is coming out why we must why we must separate ourselves why we must separate seclude ourselves to fasting to prayer to to the word to the reading of the word of God Amen there's a reason for all of this right because there's a standard that has to be set yes and trust me we're not living in a time where it's easy right in the times when the martys were killed it was easy in that time to go read the word of God to pray to have all the things but say now when you got the all of Hell on the earth and Satan is now advanc himself he knows how to infiltrate you that is why this is the hour to be under covering this is the hour where you cannot be alone and say no I'm a one man man this is the hour to have a body Ministry amen this is the hour to recognize that I'm part of the body of Christ amen I have a different anointing in his body and my anointing can take you to that level but there's another anointing in part of the body goes to another level amen amen God has different gifts in the body yes but the body is fly framed together amen each one needs the other and each one is carrying out the Mandate of Christ and this entire body of Christ becomes the banner of Christ in this hour amen she becomes the inside in this hour yes thank you Lord amen so we find in this hour when the bride is coming to a position we're not going to say when she's going to come into a position she's already coming into a position yes she's now because we can see the season has changed now amen there's a change of seon we got to recognize yes that the bride is now positionally she's in a position now amen we can't we can't use it we can't take it now because it want us prophecy when the Bride Comes to a position but now that the bride is in a position yeah in this hour because the season already opened amen then she must be the true reflection of Christ because she has a quick short work to do yes amen it's not a long work amen it's a quick short work amen and we know that the world was always looking for the inside even in every St in every time even now people are looking for something you find them all over YouTube and so forth they're waiting they look looking at events they're looking at all the things Happ and they know that they don't have the truth but they know that something is taking place and they know that something has to happen but many have missed the mark That's Right amen that it was an invisible Union already taking place and the people was having the mechanics the mechanics the mechanics but what they miss right now the re filling of the Holy Spirit upon the church the Dynamics are here in the church the Dynamics are yeah but it's in such Simplicity that people miss the mark yes amen God has always work in Simplicity yes and people don't like that they like some some big thing to happen but when God is doing the supernatural in such Simplicity they are missing it true amen but the bride must not fail in the responsibility to show Christ to the Nations amen amen through our life through a character yes they identified Christ through the bride the image of Christ displayed amen that's why he said th must prophesy again before Nation time amen Romans 8:29 says for for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son amen so it was God's for knowledge by predestination God already had those that had his DNA those that were in his thoughts he already form you and he predestinated you to be conformed yes why arst can't conform because they don't have the DNA right amen yeah like I was telling brother Adrian if if I am breeding a pedigree dog and I have pups pups are born people want to see what the parents look like before they buy the pup because they want to see the end results yes they like to view the parents they like to see this is what the pup is going to be amen so if you know your father amen hallelujah if you know your father Jehovah G Jehovah Rafa Jehovah Shalom Jehovah sh Jehovah n oh if you know your father if you know his attributes and if you know the Splendor if you know his glory and his power amen oh then you know the end results you know the battle is already won you know the victory is already yours you know that nothing can stand in your way no demon in there can stand in your way every demon will be powerless before you amen and you know the image that you're coming to amen amen thank you that's why Jesus was the perfect son yes amen he showed us he displayed the father in his fullness thank you amen then all that Christ displayed now must come to the church yes amen Greater Works than his ye shall do so if you saw the image if you saw the Christ works and the manifestations of Christ the apostles watched it they knew that he manifested this they knew the types of things he was manifesting and therefore they knew that they Ministry must also have that manifestation they could walk in that confidence because they was walking with the words amen amen then when the same spirit that was in the word that raised him from the dead now Came Upon them oh then you now we have the confidence that is why when you are endured with power from one ey amen then you know that it is not you that doing the works now but the Christ in you is doing the works that's why say greater he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen thank you Lord now why do you fear the doctor's reports why do you fear your circumstances when greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he that already overcome everything amen he that overcome the world he that come and could be amen that could be touched by the feelings of our infirmities yes he that has come to the Earth and become tangible know that the thing that we go through is now he said I go but I'll will come I will not leave you comfortless amen I will send the Holy Spirit to you amen he said I will be with you even in you amen amen so as we preparing we know what we're preparing for now this word is come to do what to prepare us to take a Rapture amen yes how Enoch walked with God this bride must also be taken up this bride must also walk with God amen amen because she has the name changed yes and when she has the name changed what happed what did he do to us when when we started to be identified when we got this identification showing us our true identity yes and giving us the D what happened our walk began to change once you were walking in a different way you were walking in the pattern of the world you forming to the things of the world but now your word began to change because the transforming power began to transform you amen amen and this very word that is transform you from within amen oh I'm telling you brother and sister you cannot walk the same way that you was walking 10 years ago amen because why you are walking now to this pyramid City amen you are now pushing up and pushing up from Glory unto Glory glory amen amen you climing up steps amen what is that higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost amen amen you can't remain the same amen as you are conforming to the word as you're conforming to the image of Christ that is the word right as you conforming and conforming you are now climbing up yes Amen to higher Dimensions amen and as you coming up to high Dimensions you are no longer being bothered about the thing of the world you are no long longer living in fear you no longer living in anxiety you're no longer living how you used to live amen you look at things in the different lives yes we find that Romans 8:15 says for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption yes whereby we cry AB father amen now we know the prophet always emphasized the relationship between God and his bride as our father and children amen we know that God had always had in the back part of his mind to have a family yes and right now the family is being displayed amen yes and God is satisfied he must come to a state where God says I am satisfied with my family amen amen I have confidence in my family amen because we didn't receive we have received I mean in this hour the spirit of adoption yes that we no longer a stranger but a child of God amen amen Growing Up From Grace unto Grace from Glory unto glory amen amen thank you Lord and the Holy Spirit bring you into spiritual maturity and how is he doing that to the five-fold ministry Ephesians 4 amen burning up this church for what and how do you do this it's it's an intimate relationship you only can have an intimate relationship because you have Fellowship you have communion amen and the more you spend time with someone you have intimate relationship so the more you spend time with God then only you can have an intimate relationship yes if you are knowing god once in a while and you can't call it an intimate relationship there's no Intimacy in it if there's no prayer life there's no intimacy right you can't be saying you have an intimate relationship with Christ if there's no prayer life that means if there's no prayer life mean you're not even talking to him how do you commun him prayer is a communication prayer is a channel of communication people people look at prayer and they look it at some religious acts but it's a communication it's a communication Channel between you and God and it's also a channel that you use where ministering spirits will take what you're praying and take charge over those things yes and it's also a channel where the devil recognize who's your connection with now yes amen right amen and then when you start giving out command you start casting out spirits and you start dealing with spirits and the angels take charge over those things then you find time demon fing amen yes when the devil recognize these people recognize who they are amen they have a communication with their father I'm in trouble now yes because if I do anything to them they're going to communicate with their father but if the devil know this person don't communicate with his father he hasn't had commun communion with his father in a long time I can take it I can go there and I can interfere with him because he won't even know how to talk to his father because you know what it is when you see someone after one year two years couple of months you don't have a you can't just communicate to them and ask them for something it takes time amen so you see the importance of this of a prayer life you see the important of communication it's intimacy with God Amen then if you don't praise him you don't worship him you don't you don't have this relationship with him right then how can you have confidence to ask him yes amen then you'll be like you just God is just someone you just use give me this give me give me that give me this give me that then you'll be like the denomination we are not called to that we are the standard bears in this hour yes amen we have the standard of we bear the standard of the Gospel in this hour yes amen amen and the standard is not the highest standard is Jesus Christ he was the highest standard set amen glory amen and we found that in this day the person that found that secret and followed the pattern was William amen and therefore he had success in his ministry amen and if you want to have good success at the Book of Joshua says then you must you can't turn to the left you can't turn to the right you keep his word amen so we find that our identity is not just in our position but also in our relationship with God as our father amen because now not just saying I've just got inheritance he not just I got I got I inherited something but you come to realize that he's your father yes it's a relationship of father son father daughter relationship you follow what I'm saying he's not just saying I inherited something but it's come to recognize that God is my father and if God is my father then I must manifest his characteristics yes sir and if his characteristic was fully manifested in Jesus Christ and that was the image and there was a there was a person on this day a Son of God named William brandham who come into that full image into such a way that in such a manner that people must look him for Christ that's right then there must be another people on the Earth that must come into that image amen amen amen and if you come into the image then that same Jesus Jus the same works of Jesus that was there with William brand must be displayed amongst you and I amen amen because he's the same yesterday today and forever am amen aren't you glad that God had to show us an example in this hour yes amen something that a standard that we could look up to amen right but now it's up to us amen that he's given us his open word amen he's given us his entire the entirety of his word he would have nothing from us amen the very book that was no one was even found worthy to look upon you are instructed not to take the book Amen to eat to partake of it yes that the very the very word that you're eating you are coming to an image now yes right all of that word is now within you because you are called to be the Temple of the Holy Ghost in the hour amen amen we must reflect the identify Christ in the hour amen so we must we must reflect the glory of of Christ in this hour because we know sh glory is dwelling now in bright form amen amen yes dwelling in the temple of men dwelling now Christ in bright form the glory must be displayed in his hour yes so you find you know the scripture says as we behold the word the glass amen yes we are changing into His Image as we behold the glass which is the word amen right we are changing into His Image moving from one level of Glory to another amen you cannot stay in yday in the form of Glory you must progress amen amen it's one level of Glory to another so we must reflect Christ in all aspects of our life yes Amen in love in brotherly love amen because why you recognize that I can't do without my brother if if that arm is missing then his body can't function if I'm just the legs I also need the arms right I need the other part of the body I need every part of the body because until we stand as a body then we can't have that Perfect Image with the head yes becoming subject to the head cuz now if you're taking one part of the body out then you can't come subject to the head cuz God doesn't have an abnormal body he has a perfect body amen he has a perfect sinless spotless bride without spot without wrinkle without blemish yes he has got a super Church a super race an invincible Army amen amen so we must display that we must display true Holiness in this hour amen we must display the truth and the power amen amen thank you Lord because many are denying the power amen so this identification is not something superficial we just talk about it is something that is we are transformed by amen and he touches every area of our life amen in such a way that is not something that when we go out there to the world they are they are feeling they anointing upon you that's right they feel how should I say okay let me let me put it this way they feel the presence of God when you are amongst people amen you know what I'm talking about amen amen right you are fa they say you are in your workplace somebody approaches you with a situation and you are and they are giving you their sad stories you can do one of two things you can go along sympathizing with it yes or you can stand firm as a Son of God a daughter of God and speak the word of God to them speak a word to them speak a word of life to them amen that's what the world needs now amen cuz they have no hope right Grace upon the Earth is only with the bride the world that is why God is depending on you to carry out his business we got to be about our father's business yes I

we talking about in this hour there will be a people that will not see death so we'll have a victory over death amen this bride will not be defeated because she's already prophesied sinless partless bride amen amen so in the face of all of opposition in the face of the de of all hell on the Earth right now hell is Unleashed on the earth this bride can stand firm upon the word of God because she's given the authority in this hour and that Banner is a sign that we have overcome that we overcome by the word and by the blood and by the spirit amen amen thank you Lord John 10:16 says and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and they shall be one fold and one Shepherd that's why Revelation 10:1 says and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and nation and tongue and King so you have the responsibility in this to raise the standard of the word because you have to prophesy again calling those names in the book amen for us to leave the Earth we got to call the nam in the book amen amen that's a responsibility amen but we must come United under Christ in this hour that's why in this hour Satan Satan loves to bring division in the body right but for us that's why Jesus prayed the prayer he said father may they be one even as we are one Christ knew that if there's no division then he saw the success of this bride amen but we know that elected must hear the shepherd's voice yes and gather under the same Banner now where is the shepherd's voice where is the shepherd's voice now yes in the final voice amen that th must prophesy again am that's the shepherd's voice now in this hour thou must prophesy again every voice must keep still every voice can speak but without Authority but this this this bride displays the shepherd's voice she become e mouthpiece amen amen she speaks for Christ amen so we are this bride is one body one people under one Banner not divided by denomination and Creeds amen yes but United under the banner of Christ by one Spirit we all are baptized into one body and In The Same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you it will also Quicken our mortal bodies am amen the same Imagine The Same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead that's what the scripture is saying it raised him from the dead it's dwelling in you the same spirit that quickening power is dwelling in you that same spirit is going to Quicken your mortal bodies is that same spirit that make you connect with the word In The Same Spirit make you aen the word In The Same Spirit make you scream out praise the Lord rejoice in the truth amen thank you Lord is the Same Spirit say that absolutely the truth amen this bride has to be a witness to the world in his last days amen she has to be because out of us right now they're going to be passing of the Bon re from Revelation 10 8 to1 it's going to go to revelation in Liv amen amen and as you can see the season approaching they shaking going on Amen the winds are shaking because it's about time for the Gentile doors to close amen but as long as this prophecy the voice of prophecy on the earth amen we must preach the gospel for the last one to come in we have to display the banner of amen as long as the voice long as the bride is on the earth there's a voice of prophecy on the earth amen am Hebrews 1:3 says the in closing the bride is called to identify with Christ sorry Hebrews 1:3 let me God who had Su triumphs and in diverse manner spake in time pass unto the fathers by the prophet and in had in his last days spoken to unto us by his son whom he had appointed air of All Things by whom also he made the world who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sin sat down in the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he had by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they then whose name do you have right now it's a more excellent Name than the Angels yes no wonder Satan is jealous of you no wonder Satan can't stand you when you recognize your true identity he didn't have a problem with you when you had Amnesia when you had you in the world but now that you recognize your true identity he has a problem with you forto which of the Angels said ye at any time Thou Art my son That's what Satan can't stand this day of I begotten the and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son Satan can't stand that that God is telling you that I will be to you a father because remember he saying this to Christ that he was doing to Christ sing it to you yes amen and he shall be to me a son he never said that to the angels only we have that privilege amen and again when he bring it in the first begot into the world he said and let all the angels of God worship Him and of the Angel he sth he said who make it his Angel spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but under the sun he said thy throne know God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou has love righteousness and hated iniquity therefore God even thy God had anointed you with the oil of gladness above thy fellows you see above th fellows and thou Lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands so you see what you see how great this is so we have the privilege to be called sons of God even angels don't have the privilege yes but you have the privilege amen so what manner of people we are to be in the S amen yes so we can see what I'm trying to say this is the hour where there must be the bride as an IDE in our amen amen so we must be the banner must be displayed by us not by anybody else there's responsibility on us amen amen let's stand amen can I have the some mus amen there a responsibility to raise we are the standard bearers of the
