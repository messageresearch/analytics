There's no other agenda we have but to fulfill God's purpose on the earth and to make the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So right now you find there's lots of world events are happening and that alone will show you how close we are. &gt;&gt; Time of the that is allotted to the gentile must come to an end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it must go back to the Jews. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But we we are here on God's allotted time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that the doors are closing in. It's a winding up time. &gt;&gt; Amen. you know in the recent weeks what's happening there and the all Israel's allies have turned against them &gt;&gt; at the United Nations how they all are supporting a two-state uh solution there and the things that are happening right now so we know that that must happen &gt;&gt; we know eventually Israel must be persecuted she must and she must call upon God amen &gt;&gt; we know when when every time when Israel called upon God you saw in the book of Exodus what happened &gt;&gt; Amen man, God sent him a deliverer. So we know that &gt;&gt; her two prophet must come down, Moses and Elijah. &gt;&gt; But we are holding him back. We are here. &gt;&gt; We got to do our part. We got to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We got to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses and Elijah come and do their part. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then Satan also comes down. But we are here right now. We got to do our part. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we find that great things are happening. Amen. We are glad that we received our message for our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. When this mighty angel comes down, when he comes down on earth, a prophet of God was here to introduce him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said a greater than Solomon is here. &gt;&gt; He said the there's a man that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Who do you say this is?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He preached, "Who is this Melzdc?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He preached the rising of the sun. Amen. &gt;&gt; What it was? It said he's a mighty God unveiled before us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was introducing him to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he preached recognize your day and your message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a changing of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a changing of dispensation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because now this was not under the first two pools. This was the third pool. Amen. &gt;&gt; The first two pools was just a bait. &gt;&gt; Yes. But in that bait in fishing he was bringing all the other type of fish in &gt;&gt; but he was fishing for the rainbow trout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That special class of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we they were there blind in Leosia. &gt;&gt; But thank God by predestination by his grace we could recognize our dare message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; They couldn't see it but we thank God that we could see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes Lord. When this message came our way, something was in us. Representation was in us. The gene of God was in us. When light light began to strike, we began to see who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we truly come from, &gt;&gt; we began to see our day and our message. &gt;&gt; We began to recognize that God has sent a message in his day. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a true sign overlooked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they didn't have reverence to God's word. what God was doing. They they spoke against it. It spoke harshly against it. &gt;&gt; They was there for the first two pools. But when it came to the opening of the word, it was too hard for them to digest. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But what he came back and said, the presence of God unrecognized. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But thank God we have recognized it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But all he was doing that time, he was saying that's my Lord up there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was introducing us to the Edstone. Amen. He said when the when the Lord said to him, "Turn the picture to the right and he could see the picture there." &gt;&gt; Amen. So what it was something that the world didn't recognize. Science had taken a picture of it. They took it as a a phenomenal cloud. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But they did notice was a supernatural &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; demonstration, a vindication that God's presence was amongst us. Amen. &gt;&gt; That he was here. The headstone has come down to unite with the body. But what it was after seven church ages. Amen. The seven angel, the one that was here. Amen. And he said he must increase. I must decrease. &gt;&gt; Because why? It was now the midnight cry going out. Amen. Behold the bridegroom cometh. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the invisible union of the bride. The heavenly bridegroom with the the heavenly bridegroom with the earthly bride. A supernatural event. A message coming from another world. Not an earthly message. Not packed up by theologians. Not packed up by any seminaries. &gt;&gt; Not packed up by any denominations. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People with the doctorate degrees and the great theologies couldn't pack this message. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. It is a supernatural message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A man with a seven great education. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who could have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where God embodied in human flesh again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming and speaking to the mouth of his prophet the words to us. What it was these words of life of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Then his other preaching uniting time in a sign the marriage of the lamb &gt;&gt; wonders. Amen. What was it? The head and body being united. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was it? The lamb coming for his bride. But he's coming as a judge at the same time. He's coming as a lion judge to the world. But a lamb to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; That same one coming, the one that did the work of redemption is coming to redeem his bride. Amen. So what? To do what? To bring us a message. A word that will change our bodies. That will take us to the wedding supper. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing else could do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in the message shalom, it's coming a time when the light and darkness will have to be separated one from another. &gt;&gt; Church and its order will take the order of the day and Christ and his light word promise will go into the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's left for them to do. It's a day today. It's a dawn of a new day for many who are looking for his coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not for everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you got your Bibles, just stand and read God's word. So, it's a glorious time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turn to the book of Romans, chapter 8, reading from verse 14. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit itself be witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if children, then hes &gt;&gt; of God and joint hes with Christ. &gt;&gt; If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time, there's complainings in the speest house. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the complaining that you go through in his time element are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. &gt;&gt; For the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the create for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope. because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption &gt;&gt; into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the old creation &gt;&gt; groaned and travail in travailed in pain together until now. And not only they but ourselves also which have the first first fruits of the spirit. Even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to what? The redemption of our body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we know that the final part of our adoption is the redemption of our body is the total healing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why divine healing is a sign. When you see somebody healed, it's a sign &gt;&gt; that one day there's going to be a total healing of this body. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're not going to leave here with the same type of body. We're going to leave with a healed body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because our theophony is going to align with this flesh body into a glorified body. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just for a little title this morning, we title this message from birth to placement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we call it the sons of God in their positions. Amen. From birth to placement, the sons of God in their position. For we know in Romans 8 saying, "For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba, father." So this morning we're dealing with this this topic that we know we we've been speaking about this week after week but just to to give it some context we want to speak on we know there's the prophet have taught us there's a difference between a born child as a being born as a child of God and being placed as a mature son with authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says he says it here in the message adoption. He says listen your adoption is not your birth. &gt;&gt; Now he's defining from the new birth and adoption. He said your adoption is your placing. &gt;&gt; When you were born again that's John 11:17. I believe we are born of the spirit of God. We are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But we were predestinated. Now, here's what I'm trying to get you to. For this, sons of the last day. You see, we were predestinated unto adoption. &gt;&gt; Now, now here we are. Now, this is what earth Pentecostal a little. They say I got born again. Praise the Lord. Got the Holy Ghost. Fine. You are a child of God. That's right. But yet, that ain't what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were predestinated unto adoption. It's a pl it's placing a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we know in the eastern tradition, if a father being a wealthy person wants to hand over his affairs, his business affairs to his son, &gt;&gt; he has to place him to tutors. &gt;&gt; Right? And he had to go to a time of tutoring. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. And it's a process of time. is not done overnight. &gt;&gt; Your Christian walk is a process. &gt;&gt; Amen. We come to justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. But it don't stop there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to go through tutors. You've got to have the you got to have the revelation of the word. The word got to be the word got to be taught to you. And you got to come to an understanding, a mature understanding of the word. You got to know how to walk in the things of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Your walk got to change you when you first come in and you have a mighty experience with God and you you have a repentance and you you have a conversion that's the one walk you come now you recognize the Lord as your personal savior you accept him as your personal savior then you go through water baptism then you are filled with the Holy Ghost then you started rejoicing you get satisfied and your life changes now you don't no longer desire to do the things you used to do &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; then he fills you up with the Holy Holy Ghost to navigate your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now there's a time where you must come to maturity to know how to handle his word, to know how to handle the things of God. You you accept your responsibility, &gt;&gt; then I'm placed on this earth for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You accept your responsibility. I accept all of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That if I'm to align with God, I must align, he is the word, I must align with the words. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you become in oneness with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you go through the tutoring which God is using now through the five-fold ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Which is the Holy Ghost is the tutor and the Holy Ghost works with men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's working through the five-fold ministry to positionally place the people and to bring them to an understanding of their the hour that they are living in and what is expected of them in the hour that they are living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this responsibility might seem like a burden at first, but when you become as you're coming mature, you realize the purpose, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; of why there to be church order and doctrine, why there to be holiness, why there to be all these things set in place in the kingdom of God is because God has a work for you to do. &gt;&gt; And God want to tabernacle into your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; But for it to tabernacle into you, it must be a surrendered life, &gt;&gt; a life of holiness, a life whereby his holy spirit can indwell in you can navigate your life. That he be no longer that you that speak it, but he that will speak through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you come to say we say this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the level of maturity. Yes. &gt;&gt; Then he is now placing you into the body. &gt;&gt; And you know, pastor was going and speaking about the mystery of his will being adoption, right? And when we talk about the mystery of his will, &gt;&gt; now that a will is something not revealed to everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When a person dies, he has a will. That's his will. His last testament, his will, &gt;&gt; right? and and upon his death the will is now maybe the attorney will call the family the heirs of the will only the heirs of the will know what's contained in the will &gt;&gt; it's not for everybody &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; amen so the mystery of his will is adoption this is not for everybody &gt;&gt; it's only for the air &gt;&gt; wonderful &gt;&gt; amen because why that's the mystery of his will &gt;&gt; that the world knows nothing about that you were hes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So therefore adoption is not for everybody. &gt;&gt; Now adoption now these you already was a son. You predestinated unto adoption. Other words you was going through you had to go through the process. Nothing is going to take away your sunship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the process might take time. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's what the five ministry trying to get you up and to standard. Get you now upgraded into the position you ought to be in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You got to come into your placement and position. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's what we're speaking about from birth to placement. There was a time you come to the birth, but now you must come to placement because God wants his sons in their positions. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Everyone standing at the post of duty. So he can use us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So therefore you find that when the headstone properties was introducing the headstone the time was not the appointed time. There was no people at that time that was now going to be honed. &gt;&gt; But the message was stored up in books and tapes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But in due time and season, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost will run his trail. Run his trail again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost will go on the cycle again, bringing this word to his predestinated seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Then he's going to bring them into alignment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he's going to shape them up. &gt;&gt; He's going to hone them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When now the capstone can come down. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where they can come up a little higher. Amen. &gt;&gt; They can come out of little because little has already been blinded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They can come out of the valley of dry bones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They can come up higher into the mountain of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where the glory of God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where the shikina glory is there. Where the fresh mana where the mana can never be still. &gt;&gt; The mana is being fresh all the time. Amen. &gt;&gt; The inexhaustible fountain of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now, not everybody can come out there. &gt;&gt; It's a horning time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many many have come in seed form and could have been hiding amongst them in seed form. But there comes a time where it's fruit form. &gt;&gt; And you can hide seed, but you can't hide fruit. &gt;&gt; By the fruit, you shall know who they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Galatians 14:7 says, the book of Galatians in chapter 4 verse 1-7 says, "Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, defereth nothing from his servants, though he be lord of all, &gt;&gt; but he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father." Amen. &gt;&gt; Even so we when we were children, we were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law, &gt;&gt; that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because they are sons, God had sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying, aba, father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, than an heir of God to Christ. Now the prophet said, now when you receive the Holy Ghost, that's one thing. You're born. But now for the ceremony of adoption, then he adopted this boy into his family and they had a ceremony. Now if they would write checks, anything that boy did was just as good. His name was just as good on the checks as his father's after the adoption. He was heir after the adoption. So in other words, he must go through the tutorship. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; And when he's proven to be now a son worthy to continue the father's affairs &gt;&gt; now he can take he can sign and use sign those checks &gt;&gt; using his father's authority. &gt;&gt; All the authority that the father had is vested into the son. &gt;&gt; All that was in God he poured into Christ. All that was in Christ he poured into his church. &gt;&gt; That's why he said greater works than his ye shall do. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not just for any bunch of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not for the wishy-washy bunch. It's for those that have been proven themselves. &gt;&gt; Those that come into alignment with his word &gt;&gt; come into alignment with his program. That all that understand his affairs. Those that understand the mind of Christ, those that understand the mysteries of his will. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those that understand his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Well, that's where the church needs to be tonight. It needs to be to a place that God will call you up somewhere and throw his glory over you." &gt;&gt; That the only time you can have his glory on you, you've got to come up higher where the shakina glory is. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And experience in his glory. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then if he's if you are with him and he's holy now, he's tabernacling in you cuz it must be God in bride form. God tabernacling in human flesh again. &gt;&gt; So if he's tabernacling in you then his glory must be shown through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz his glory is not going to be shown anywhere else on the earth. &gt;&gt; When you've come united with him when you know how to come now, you are seated now in heavenly places. You are now you are united with him. Amen. You are in oneness with him. His glory must be displayed through you. Then the people will see the resurrected Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; When they see you walking on the streets, they will see the power of God in you. When they see you speak, when you're speaking to people &gt;&gt; and they start now and speaking about things that happening and you start saying them a few nuggets, they will be astonished at the way you are speaking. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're not speaking from earthly, you're not speaking from earthly things. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are speaking from things from another world. &gt;&gt; Things that the their the knowledge won't give them. &gt;&gt; The knowledge is limited. But you will know now the infinite mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; He's been revealed through his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. So he says he spread his power upon you, adopt you and place you glory into the body where that when you speak something happens. &gt;&gt; If you say this m to this mountain be thou removed it shall be removed. &gt;&gt; That's what the church is needing tonight. But if we our character goes down instead of going up, how is he going to do it? &gt;&gt; We continue to believe every work of God and seek after righteousness and do that which is right in the sight of God daily calling on him daily about his work getting others to come into church. In other words, you must be so thoroughly convinced of this. You you you know what is going to happen on the earth. You want others to to see the things that you believe. You want others to have the same rejoicing that you are rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, you found a p of great price. You want to share it with others. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; These are the blessing that the spiritual blessing that you have received. You want to share these blessings with others. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says we got to to believe every work of God and seek after righteousness and do that which is right in the sight of God daily calling on him daily about his work getting others to come into church trying to get somebody to come serve the Lord. Now if you're going to be around people and you are a negative person, you're always grumbling, you're always moouring about the government, the politics that the currency, about your health, and you you are negative, you you have such a people just don't want to be around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; How you going to show and display his glory through you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you are in line with him, if you are separated with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. you people will be attracted around you. &gt;&gt; There'll be an attraction around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it will be the Holy Ghost in you that will be attracting the people. &gt;&gt; It'll be a magnetic force. &gt;&gt; People will be see such a love of Christ in you. &gt;&gt; They will feel that this person I can go to them with my problem because if they're going to tell me something that's going to help me. &gt;&gt; They're not going to bring me more down. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; They're not going to tell me something more negative. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So if you're going to be a person that's grumpy, people want to be around you. They want to run away from you. &gt;&gt; But you need to have a such an attraction that people want to be around you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about when you're in your workplace and all that you and people bring up suddenly you bring up a topic and you start talking about things that we believe in. &gt;&gt; They never hear of things like this. &gt;&gt; Not from this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they get astonished and they suddenly start coming around you and they start want to hear more of these things. They might not fully understand but there's something that attracting them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it? The Holy Ghost in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says all the people you work for, the milkman, the postman, the iceman, &gt;&gt; and whoever it is, all you come in contact with, speak to them about the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak it with seasonable words. &gt;&gt; Not just any word. Seasonable words. &gt;&gt; In other words, bring it to a current topic. They're talking about the politics. Then tell them, bring the politics in it. Bring God in the politics. &gt;&gt; They're talking about sickness, bring God in it. &gt;&gt; Tell him what he's done for them. They're talking about finances. Bring Jehovah Gyra on the scene. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're talking about healing. Bring Jehovah Rafa on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They disturb. They got troubled. The mind is troubled. They vex in the spirit. Bring Jehovah shalom on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring him on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring the I am to every situation on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's got to work through you. You've got to be a person that's going to impact the people around you. He said, "All you come in contact, speak to them about the Lord. Speak it with seasonable words sweetly that don't jump onto them. Don't go tell them now, hey, look at how you dressed up. Look at how you God can't use you. I can't pray for you." No, no, no. Don't jump on them. Speak it with sweetness. &gt;&gt; That they'll say, say, say that lady is a real lady. She spoke to me about the Lord. That man, I never seen such a man. He's the nicest man I ever met. You know, I would like to have his religion. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what they think about this religion. But a religion is a covering. That's right. And our covering is not we are Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal. Our covering is the blood of Jesus Christ. That's our covering, our religion. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now notice this that when this adoption come, that boy's name was just as good as his daddy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was heir of all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That all his father had, so did we have. Now Jesus said, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do, John 14:12, shall he do also. He'll be able to do the same things that I do." Now God was proving here what he was doing to his own son. He had pleased him. &gt;&gt; You see every promise is available to us. &gt;&gt; It's how we come to how we align oursel to his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything is there. God has not been short of giving us anything any redemptive blessing. It's upon us knowing how to go and grab those blessings. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we find that in in the eastern tradition the Hebrew father always he waited he waited for a period of time until his son proved maturity under tutors. &gt;&gt; And we know that from the time the messages come there was a period of time God had to put us under tutors. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he publicly placed him giving him the authority of his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So being born again makes you a child of God. Yes. But placement makes you an heir with authority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now when you're adopted, your prayers, your testimony, your words, everything you speak is backed by heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have a heavenly backing. So if you say to this mountain, be removed. You said it, it's going to be backed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You spoke to that cancer to leave your body, it must leave. &gt;&gt; Amen. You spoke your situation from a negative situation to a positive one. It must come to pass. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You spoke that job that you did, it must come. It must be backed by heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's open to Romans 8:19. Romans 8:19 says, "For the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God." Now, if you got your Bible, just turn to the book of Ezekiel, chapter 37, read from 1-4. The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley, which was full of bones, and caused me to pass by them round about. And behold, there were very many in the open valley. And lo, they were very dry. Oh, thank God. We once were dry, but we no longer in the valley. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where everything is dry? We no longer seia. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he said unto me, son of man, can these bones live? &gt;&gt; And I answered, Lord God, thou knowest? Again he said unto me, prophesy upon these bones and say unto them, oh ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord God unto these bones, behold, I will cause breath to enter into your into you and ye shall live. And I will lay sne upon you and will bring up flesh upon you &gt;&gt; and cover you with skin and put breath in you know &gt;&gt; and ye shall live &gt;&gt; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. So I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone. And when I beheld, and lo, sign you, that the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above, but there was no breath in them. Then said he unto me, "Prophesy unto the wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, thus say the Lord God, come from the four wind breath, and breathe upon the slain that they may live." &gt;&gt; So here's the prophecy again. Okay. So I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great army. Amen. So we find that in in in verse one he's saying the hand of the Lord was upon me. So he's speaking about that we know we was once down. Amen. We was once down in the letter among the little among the chicken biards. Amen. But we were called up to come up higher. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're no longer in a place where it's dry. We're in a place where the shikina glories. &gt;&gt; We're in a place where we have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know what he once done with the word. We're in a place where the mana is always fresh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And verse three says, "And he said unto me, oh son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered, "Oh Lord God, thou knowest." And again he said unto me, prophesy upon his bone and said unto him. So it wasn't just prophesying anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was or he says don't just say anything. You must be particular in what you're saying. &gt;&gt; So God wouldn't just leave you to put your own ideas and think. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't the prophet say exactly what this is? &gt;&gt; He's given us his words. &gt;&gt; He's given us the word of what to speak in this hour. &gt;&gt; He puts the word in us. Amen. In verse 7, it says, "So I prophesied as I was commanded, and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone." So what was that speaking about? Something happened in the spiritual realm. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a shaking. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When this word went forth, there was a shaking. There was a noise. And each bone was coming to his together and the bone was aligning with each bone. In other words, there wasn't out of place. It wasn't a a backbone. Now it's going to be a footbone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, the bones was coming together bone to his bone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He couldn't take a leg bone to make a neck bone. Amen. &gt;&gt; The body must be fitly joined and compacted together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said because now every joint supplied for more effectual working didn't Paul say that &gt;&gt; working of the body that every joint supplied for the more effectual working of the body and verse 8 says that when I beheld and lowered the sinus and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them. You see? &gt;&gt; So you find that it was a four-fold prophecy. One was a promise of su flesh and skin and then bread. &gt;&gt; Now they still need bread to come forth. That's why the second prophecy went forth. Amen. And he delivered. We know what happened here. He says the prophet of God says prophesy son of man. Can these bones live? Wish we had time. I got it wrote down here. But I have to miss that prophesy. Can his bones live? What's the four stages of death coming forth of the church? What's the four stage of Ezekiel's dry bones coming forth? &gt;&gt; But the life only come not when the sign su skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them. That's when come back that fought message of life. I will restore, say the Lord. Hallelujah. Glory. Praise be to God. The fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs. &gt;&gt; Justification brought back the pulp. Sanctification brought back the bach doctrine of holiness. What brought back the leaf? Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; What is it? Pentecostal. The leaf clap their hand. Joy rejoicing. Pentecostal. The foot was the word &gt;&gt; itself. The word was made flesh. In other words, he himself is here being manifested in human flesh again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Being manifested in your eyes. What it is the dynamics of the Holy Ghost coming upon his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We had the mechanics. But now this is the word that's coming flesh. The word that's coming to life. It is the endemics coming upon the mechanics that bringing the word to life. &gt;&gt; It is a quickening power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word that was laying there, now it's coming with a quickening power upon his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. The word was made flesh, fruits of the proof of the resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification being planted, sanctification being planted, baptism of the Holy Ghost, organization died out and Christ has again sented himself like the cap of the pyramid. M &gt;&gt; first line justification, sanctification, baptism of Holy Ghost, then coming of the cap. &gt;&gt; What is it? The Holy Ghost punch being owned out so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when it went away. That when he comes back, it'll catch the whole thing in the rapture where the justified, sanctified, and baptism of the Holy Ghost, that pyramid will stand again. The house of God will live again. The tree of life is growing again. &gt;&gt; So you see where we are now. You see what the Holy Spirit has been showing us how we are to be honed. It is so that he could come and kept the pyramid. Amen. We have to come into that plan. Amen. Where he can fitly come into us. Amen. So perfectly that you cannot set them apart. &gt;&gt; You can't see anything else. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You only see oneness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ, the bride, heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride come into oneness. That is why after the seventh age, after the church ages, we call into another age. &gt;&gt; It was a dawn of a new day. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were saying shalom. A rise and shine. The light is come. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was it? What was the mystery of his coming? It's connected with a shout. It's connected with Revelation 10:1 and the the seven tunnels, the seven seals. What was it? Our light has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our light has come. We could arise now and shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the glory of the Lord is risen upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that for you to have the glory of God, you have to come into you have to come up &gt;&gt; to where the glory of God is into the mountain of God. &gt;&gt; Come up into the headstone. &gt;&gt; Come up into the heavenly places. You are now seated in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; That is why when you are speaking now, you are speaking from heavenly places. &gt;&gt; You're speaking from another world. &gt;&gt; You're not speaking by human intellect. You're not speaking by human understanding. That is why now when you say to that demon, "Be thou removed." When you bind that mama, oh, when you go now to bind that demon, you know now you got the backing of heaven, you're speaking with authority from another world. Amen. And therefore now if you say to your brother I loose you from those infirmities in the name of Jesus Christ you know you got the backing of heaven behind you when you go to your brother now that the devil is troubling you say I bind you in the name of Jesus &gt;&gt; you bind that mama that thing that's troubling you bind it &gt;&gt; but you know now spiritually where you're getting it from. &gt;&gt; Amen. For he said whatever you bind on earth I shall bind in heaven. What you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why he said heaven and earth shall pass away but my words because these are eternal words &gt;&gt; shall not pass away. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you find that this Holy Ghost bunch being honed out. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what was it? The second prophecy. What was it? The dynamics. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The breadth that makes the bride rise at an exceeding army. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the scripture goes on, it doesn't stop there. &gt;&gt; It also speaks about in verses, let's go to verse 11. He said, "Then he said unto me, son of man, these bones," okay, let's go to verse 10. So I prophesied and as he commanded me, and bread came unto them. When did the bread came? where this word has come down. Amen. What was it? The dynamics coming down again. &gt;&gt; Bringing it to become an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Marching. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; A super church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A super race. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan can't do anything to her now &gt;&gt; because Satan cannot get up where he is. &gt;&gt; Satan cannot get up to the headstone. Amen. &gt;&gt; He cannot get this revelation. That is why he said this is not a public show. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The angel of God told him, "You spend too much time dwelling on your first to pull explaining these things, &gt;&gt; but you can't don't explain this one &gt;&gt; because this was not a public show." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to be locked in and there you got to be shut in with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Shut into the heavenly place into the heavenly sphere to recognize these things. That is why they will never understand these things. &gt;&gt; Satan knows the Bible, but he doesn't have this revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. And therefore you find now he says we become the invincible army. Verse 11 he says then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost. We are cut off from our parts. Therefore prophesy and say unto them thus say the Lord God behold oh my people I will open your grave and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see this, it's also speaking about redemption, the full redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's also speaking of a resurrection. We coming out of something, but we are going into something else. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are now in the land of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in this land, there is no you passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, &gt;&gt; you've already passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Because you have received the message of grace, &gt;&gt; which is the message of life. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you could say, "Oh de, where is your sting? &gt;&gt; Oh grave, where is your victory?" It's revealed to you. I am passed from dead unto life. What Satan can do to this body because I know where I go. Amen. &gt;&gt; And for those that will not go into the grave, they are those that will now be translated from from this natural life to a spiritual life. Amen. &gt;&gt; From this natural body to a spiritual body, &gt;&gt; from the natural to the supernatural. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But all nature is groaning and surveilling. Even the saints in the sixth dimension, they're waiting upon us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For us to be perfected in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; That we will come into perfection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz they without us cannot be made perfect. says in Ephesians 1:3 and 6 say, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children, by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Second Peter 15:8 says and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge to knowledge temperance to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Then we speak about in the valley they were dry. &gt;&gt; Now you are called up to come up higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you come, how you come up higher? You come to the stature &gt;&gt; of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you come up higher into the headstone, you can't be barren. You can't be unfruitful. You must be fruitful and multiply. &gt;&gt; Because you are eating from the heavenly manner. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "And he made uh creatures and creatures fell and then God in in a message adoption uh paragraph 54 and he says, "And he made creatures and creatures fell. And then God by infinite in infinitity looked down through the stream of time and saw every man that would be saved. Did you get that? Paragraph 54 message adoption. He knew it by fornowledge that by fornowledge knew who would be saved and who would not be saved. He could predestinate. So the word is not such a bad word after all &gt;&gt; is it? He could predestinate because he knew who would and would who would not. &gt;&gt; Therefore in order to catch those who would he had to make a propitiation for their sins. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Or if we can we want to get to it just a few verses below. He's predestinated us to eternal life &gt;&gt; knowing that those who would lay aside everything. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When are you becoming an oddball? When are you going to be persecuted for his word? &gt;&gt; Because he said if you Jesus said if you love me you will keep my words and my words will not be grievious unto you. So he said who would lay aside everything and no matter how indifferent it would look to what the children of the world it would mean one thing to them because they were children of God and he called them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when God places us by his fornowledge Amen. and places that man in the body of Christ we know that no devil can move him &gt;&gt; because he predestination. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you might even if the man can be backslid to he must come up. &gt;&gt; God will find a way of bringing him up. Amen. &gt;&gt; No devil can move that man because if God predestinated you because it's by his forn knowledge he already knew &gt;&gt; that you will believe his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He already knew that you will live by his standards. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You will love his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we find that he said the fine line justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, then coming of the cap. What is it? The Holy Ghost bunch being horned so that he can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away. &gt;&gt; It must be the same kind. It must be Jesus Christ must be seen on display. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It can't be anything short of what he what he did on the earth. Amen. You know, if you look at life, you can't be like me. I can't be like you. &gt;&gt; Every one of us are unique. &gt;&gt; But we are supposed to attain to be like Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's who we attain to be like. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you're like Christ and I'm like Christ, then we are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. But our unique characters in the flesh are different. But when we attain to Christ, that brings us into oneness. &gt;&gt; It brings us into an harmony. It brings us in one mind, one spirit, one accord. And when we are there, then watch the power of God come down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Upon his people, &gt;&gt; watch how God works. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then when you That is why he takes a hidden life. A hidden life is when you alone you're praying. You alone you're fasting. You alone you're meditating on the word. Then when you're out there in the public, you don't have to scream. You don't have to hold up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You just go and speak the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? In your hidden life, you know what you're doing behind the scenes. Jesus went every night. He departed from the people. He went in prayer. Prophet did the same thing. But when he come out, you'll see him there. He's not screaming. He's not shouting. &gt;&gt; He's just rebuking. He's just praying. Receive your healing. Receive your healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus did the same thing when he went there. He just spoke the word. He didn't scream at the demon. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Because the demon already knew &gt;&gt; who he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you go and a spirit upon a person, they must recognize. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That spirit must have convulsions. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because they must recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They must recognize this is a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; What have I what have I to do with you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you are now coming in my territory. &gt;&gt; You tell him this is not your territory. You only You are only a squatter &gt;&gt; in this place. &gt;&gt; And you give him eviction notice. &gt;&gt; You demon of cancer, we evict you in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Whatever the situation is, you give that demon eviction notice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we know that the the pyramid when he was there when he not build a pyramid, the pyramid it didn't have the headstone. Amen. Like the church, it was incomplete until this the fullness of time was come, which is now. &gt;&gt; Until now, where Christ, the headstone, the capstone could come. But he couldn't. He had to come to a people that had to be home. It's coming to such a needle point that therefore you find that those that are not in alignment with him has to fall out on the way side. &gt;&gt; They have to be taken out. Amen. It's nothing to do with them. &gt;&gt; It's just by predestination. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; It's God divine choosing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's nothing good to say it's my ability. I began to see this. I began to see that. No. &gt;&gt; I didn't begin to see that. Had it not been for the grace of God, &gt;&gt; had he not opened it up to us, we wouldn't be able to see the things we see. &gt;&gt; We won't be able to believe the things we believe. Had it not been for his grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in this adoption process, he is the headstone sealing the bride. &gt;&gt; It's a complete seal. Amen. Because first you have to be taken out of the little sea and age into the bride age and then the cap caper to come down when the bride are to be owned into a fl. Amen. And what it is a ceiling it is what showing that's his adoption and he can now come when there's unity now between the head and the body and it comes to such a wonders. Amen. So it is what it shows that this church has come into the has come to maturity. A character has been shaped. A character has been molded. She's now the manifestation of Christ's very life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seated in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; She's immovable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's becomes immovable. She can't be tossed to and fro with every minute of doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's immovable. She's operating now as the invincible army of God. &gt;&gt; So the question was asked in Ezekiel, can these bones live? &gt;&gt; The answer in this day and this hour is yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? The life is in her now. &gt;&gt; She stands placed in a position. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is here. The mighty angel is here amongst us. &gt;&gt; Amen. who is positionally placed us into the place that we ought to be now. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that brought us from birth into placement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wasn't the work of a man, but the Holy Ghost, the mighty angel that is here amongst us, bringing us the living word, the living bread of life &gt;&gt; into our current state of affairs, bringing us into our current stage of our present ministry. &gt;&gt; This ministry where Christ is in the bride. Amen. Christ is in his body dwelling in a many membered body. Amen. Where sons of God have been tested with the word. &gt;&gt; They have been tried but they still standing today in 2025 still standing and believing this word firmly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where many have fallen in the wayside but sons and daughters of God being tried and tested will still believe this word will still amen his word. will still punctuate every word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where you can openly believe the word because you are now the manifest. You have received the bread of life and the headstone come with love. Amen. Standing and here it is now standing as the very image of Christ. &gt;&gt; When I see you, I see Christ. When you see me, you see Christ. How do you see it? The way the word is broken, &gt;&gt; the way you love the word, the way you appreciate the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The way you enjoy his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we fellowship around his word. &gt;&gt; Yes. In the church age book he mentions he mentions they in the bride will be so much like him &gt;&gt; that in the pagan church age he says they in the bride will be so much like him they will even be in his very image. &gt;&gt; This is in order to be united with him they will be one. You see it was the owning coming to his image aligning with him so we could come in on wonders with him. They will be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. The nominations cannot produce this wrong seed. They will produce the creed and the dogmas mixed with the word. The mongalizing brings forth a hybrid product. The first son Adam was a spoken seed word of God. He was given a bride to reproduce himself. That is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to reproduce another son of God. But she fell. She couldn't wait for Adam to come into full stature. Amen. She couldn't wait for Adam to come to full stature and now speak Eve. He shall produce. But she fell. She fell by hypnotization. She caused him to die. &gt;&gt; The second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was given a rhyme like as was Adam. But when he but before he could marry her, she also had fallen. She like Adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God and live or doubt the word and die. She doubted. She left the word. She died. She went to Nia Rome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she died right there. &gt;&gt; From a little group of the true seed of the word. God will present Christ with a beloved bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's a virgin of his word. She is a virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride would be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin. The word of promise came to the virgin Mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest. God was made manifest. He himself acted at a time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin. It was an angel that had brought her the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the angel's message was the word of God. Isaiah 9:6, he fulfilled all that time, all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her. The members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potential for he is their head and all power belongs to him. They are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads. &gt;&gt; Notice the harmony of the father and the son. Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father. John 5:19. &gt;&gt; This harmony is now to exist between groom and his bride. &gt;&gt; He showed he shows her his word of life. She receives it. She never doubts it. Therefore, nothing can armor, not even death. &gt;&gt; For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Here is the secret of this. The word is in the bride as it was in Mary. The bride has the mind of Christ. For she knows what he once done with the word. She performs the command of the word in his name. For she has thus said the Lord. Then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see, you're not just to expected just to be nominal Christian. You're not expected just to remain born again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But you are to be play being placed as sons of God &gt;&gt; coming to our position as our what it was the headstone has descended. The pyramid is complete with us not without us. Amen. With every part of the body when every part of the body comes into its bone upon bone. Amen. Joint upon joint then that pyramid is complete. The bride is sealed. So this is our way says rise and shine. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Walk in your position as sons of God in our placement in our &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're moving. The Holy Spirit has moved us from birth to placement. &gt;&gt; Where sons of God are in their rightful position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where demons are having demons must have convulsions. &gt;&gt; Demons must have no place to hide. &gt;&gt; Al is unleashed on the earth. But God needs his invincible army in the force, in the forefront. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has placed a responsibility on us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To carry out his words &gt;&gt; where demon powers can't be able to stand us, withstand us. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because right now they're going on a rampage upon the earth. There's chaos on the earth right now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Every time you look at the news, it's bad news. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's murders. Like it's becoming so common now to to see murders. &gt;&gt; What is that? Demon power upon the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gr darkness upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But sons of God need to take out their position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And manifest Christ again upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; So the world will see Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So these things are doesn't just come by just saying I'm reading this line or following a thought. No, it comes with a surrendered life. &gt;&gt; It come with a separate individual life. Is that where you're going and praying in front of people and showing people how old you are? I know it's your Bible time of God. &gt;&gt; When you go to the people, they must see Christ through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They must experience Christ through you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you have your alone time, when you have the time, you got to make time for the things of God. You know, I was telling brother, look, you are what you eat in the natural. &gt;&gt; So the same thing is you'll you'll you will see a person's spiritual growth by what they eat &gt;&gt; in the spiritual. &gt;&gt; If you are what you eat in the natural, you are what you eat in the spiritual. You eat all your junk food, your processed food, you get sick and you complain. But you are what you eat. &gt;&gt; But if you eat the right food spiritually, then you will walk in a with spiritual growth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you partake of the right food, the right diet which is given which the Holy Ghost is feeding it through the firefold ministry &gt;&gt; in this hour, &gt;&gt; then you must grow spiritually. Amen. And you must be spiritually healthy. Then you can flex your spiritual muscles &gt;&gt; over every demon power, over every attack of the enemy. And you can walk victoriously as an invincible army, as a super church, as a super race. And he's already prophesied over you. &gt;&gt; And he will present himself a glorious church without spot, without wrinkle, without blemish. God bless you. Let's pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
