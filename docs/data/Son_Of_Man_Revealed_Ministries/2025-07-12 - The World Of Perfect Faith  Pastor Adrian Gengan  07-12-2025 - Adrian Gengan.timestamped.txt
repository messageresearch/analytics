[3:44] &gt;&gt; We ask your blessings now even as we
[3:45] further continue in Jesus name.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Greetings in the mighty, the all
[3:51] powerful name of our Lord and Savior
[3:53] Jesus Christ. Let's give our Lord and
[3:55] Savior a wonderful clap of praise.
[3:57] [applause and cheering]
[3:58] Amen. He is victorious. [applause]
[4:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to Amen. our Bible.
[4:04] Then we can be seated.
[4:06] Let's go to Luke 18:8.
[4:09] Praise the Lord.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; I just want to read from the second part
[4:20] there. Amen. And it says, "Nevertheless,
[4:22] when the Son of Man cometh, shall he
[4:24] find faith on the earth."
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; So God's not looking for how well we are
[4:31] dressed.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. How religious we are.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; The thing that moves God is faith.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; Wednesday, we were telling you, you
[4:40] can't pray to God and ask him for money
[4:41] because there's no money in heaven.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Faith is the currency of heaven.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Amen. So when the son of man
[4:50] cometh, shall he find faith on the
[4:53] earth?
[4:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; There is faith enough in heaven,
[4:57] &gt;&gt; but he wants to find that kind of faith
[4:59] on the earth.
[4:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; What kind of faith? Let's go to Mark
[5:03] 11:23. See the kind of faith that God is
[5:06] requiring in this time and season.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; Now, this is one level of faith.
[5:13] Hallelujah.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Mark 11:3 is 111. one level of faith. It
[5:19] says, "For verily I say unto you that
[5:22] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[5:25] be thou removed."
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; And be thou cast into the sea, and shall
[5:30] not doubt in his heart,
[5:32] &gt;&gt; but shall believe that those things
[5:33] which he saith shall come to pass, he
[5:36] shall have whatsoever he saith.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the kind of faith to remove
[5:42] things. Everybody say, "Amen."
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Mark 11:23 is a faith to remove things.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; Remove every circumstance.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Remove every doubt.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; Remove every fear.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; But this bride doesn't move with one
[6:02] level of faith only to remove things.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Romans chapter 4. We'll go
[6:07] to verse 17. There [clears throat]
[6:11] &gt;&gt; we've got power to also bring things on
[6:13] the scene.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only remove obstacles.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Romans 4:17, it says, "As it is
[6:23] written," talking about Abraham, "I have
[6:26] made thee a father of many nations
[6:28] before him whom he believed." Who does
[6:32] he believe? God.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Now, who quickened the dead? Somebody
[6:37] say God.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; God.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; Now, he's talking, most people think
[6:41] that Abraham, this is talking about
[6:43] Abraham. This verse actually moves on to
[6:45] God now. So even God who quicken the
[6:49] dead and calleth those things which be
[6:51] not as though they were.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; That's the level of our faith. We call
[6:56] things which are not as though they
[6:58] were.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; Abraham was operating with this kind of
[7:01] faith as well.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; He started to call things which were not
[7:04] as though they were.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; When he was GOING TO KILL ISAAC on the
[7:08] mountain, he said, "I and the lad shall
[7:11] return."
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He started to call it before it
[7:14] happened.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; So we have a ministry not just to speak
[7:17] things out of existence. We have a
[7:19] ministry to call things.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; The Lord had blessings reading up. We're
[7:24] speaking this morning the world of
[7:25] perfect faith. How to operate in a world
[7:28] of perfect faith.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; A word of perfect faith.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; Are we living in a world of perfect
[7:37] faith?
[7:39] God's not going to ask you how many
[7:41] years you were in the message.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; God's not going to ask you if you wore
[7:44] long dresses,
[7:46] &gt;&gt; even though those things are required.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; God's not going to ask you if you paid
[7:49] your tithes.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; God's looking for faith.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; He's looking for a people who are living
[7:55] in a world of perfect faith.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; And Christ has done it all.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; Because he says, while we were dead in
[8:01] our sins, Christ raised us up to be
[8:03] seated together with Jesus.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; In heavenly places. Amen. Wonderful.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we are looking for a
[8:13] perfecting kind of faith.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a mustard seed
[8:19] faith.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a small level of
[8:25] faith.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. After the opening of the word and
[8:29] after the prophetic gift has come,
[8:32] after the title deed of redemption to
[8:34] the earth has come, God is requiring a
[8:38] higher level of faith.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Because we ALL KNOW THAT HOW DOES FAITH
[8:42] COME? Faith cometh.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S A CONTINUAL COMING.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Cometh by the hearing. As you hear the
[8:50] word of God.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by the hearing. Hearing by
[8:54] the word of God.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. M
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; So the kind of faith THAT WE ARE TO BE
[9:00] generating because we are a faith
[9:02] generator.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; As we hear the word of God, it's
[9:08] generating faith within us.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; And are we a 100 rand faith generator,
[9:18] thousand rand faith generator, million
[9:20] rand generator,
[9:22] &gt;&gt; or we a billion rand generator?
[9:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:26] Praise the Lord. Because we generate
[9:28] faith.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; By what we are hearing.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; And now that he HAS UNFOLDED THE ENTIRE
[9:34] PLAN OF GOD, REVEALED ALL THE MYSTERIES
[9:36] of God, revealed the hidden mysteries in
[9:39] the back part of God's mind, and
[9:41] released to us back the spoken word.
[9:43] This ought TO BE THE GOD KIND of faith.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the kind of faith we are
[9:56] looking for is Galatians 2:20. Now as
[9:58] you are writing the scriptures, you
[10:00] ought to be referencing the scriptures
[10:01] daily in your life because we are not
[10:03] operating on our own faith.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; It is no longer I that liveth.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; I am crucified with Christ.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; So don't come looking for gan died.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Don't be so proud of our earthly names.
[10:20] Earthly names and earthly lineages carry
[10:22] curses.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; Earthly names and earthly lineages carry
[10:27] problems.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Earthly names and earthly lineages
[10:31] through your bloodline can carry
[10:32] problems.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BIBLE IS DECLARING THAT I
[10:38] &gt;&gt; SAY I
[10:38] &gt;&gt; I
[10:39] &gt;&gt; AM CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; So you can't find the old me
[10:45] &gt;&gt; because I'm a new creation
[10:47] &gt;&gt; and I'm A BRAND NEW MAN. AMEN.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS ARE PASSED AWAY.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; AND I'M BORN AGAIN.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; SO DON'T BE SO PROUD TO TELL people
[10:57] about that old man
[10:58] &gt;&gt; and what he did. YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
[11:00] FOR THE WHOLE MAN AND WHAT HE DID.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; That old man was subject TO THE LAWS OF
[11:05] THE FLESH
[11:06] &gt;&gt; TO THE LAW OF sin
[11:07] &gt;&gt; to the curse.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN CHRIST DIED, I DIED WITH HIM.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE AROSE, I ALSO AROSE WITH HIM.
[11:16] AMEN.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; SO THE LIFE I NOW LIVE, LET'S HEAR WHAT
[11:19] THE APOSTLE PAUL IS SAYING. I am
[11:20] crucified with Christ.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; So show me Naidu.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; Show me Moody.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Show me Chatty.
[11:28] Show me Mir.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Then you're projecting flesh.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; You know in our family, we're very proud
[11:38] of our name. No, you're projecting
[11:40] flesh.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; You ought to be proud of the family
[11:43] name.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT ALL heaven is named after.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:48] [applause]
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; NOW I CAN ASCRIBE BLESSINGS TO THIS
[11:52] NAME.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Now if I ONLY FOCUS ON AN EARTHLY NAME,
[11:55] WITH THE EARTHLY name I said comes all
[11:57] manners of sicknesses, diseases,
[11:59] problems and all of these kind of
[12:01] things.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; But with the heavenly name,
[12:05] &gt;&gt; I am summoning heaven.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY DO WE HAVE THOUGHTS ON
[12:09] THE EARTH? They are patterning an
[12:11] heavenly
[12:13] &gt;&gt; PATTERN BECAUSE IN THE COURTS OF HEAVEN,
[12:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; IT WAS DETERMINED.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, LORD.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Why do you think Romans 8 starts out
[12:22] like that? Put Romans 8:1. What do you
[12:24] think Romans 8:1 starts out about?
[12:28] &gt;&gt; That there was an accuser who was
[12:29] accusing us.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; But Romans 8:1 says, THERE'S NOW THE THE
[12:33] KING MAKING JUDGMENT IN THE COURTS OF
[12:35] HEAVEN.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NOW. AMEN.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, NO CONDEMNATION.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; TO THEM WHICH ARE IN CHRIST JESUS.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Who walk NOT AFTER THE FLESH, THE FIVE
[12:46] SENSES, BUT after the spirit.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; So, IN THE COURTS OF HEAVEN, IT WAS
[12:52] DETERMINED YOU ARE NOT GUILTY.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; In the courts of heaven, IT WAS
[12:57] DETERMINED THAT YOU ARE BLAMELESS,
[12:59] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU ARE SPOTLESS,
[13:01] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU ARE WITHOUT WRINKLE.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; In the courts of heaven, IT WAS
[13:05] DETERMINED
[13:07] that you can't carry faith in your
[13:08] flesh.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; So where do we carry this billionaire
[13:12] faith?
[13:13] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that in your
[13:15] soul
[13:17] &gt;&gt; there's two
[13:19] &gt;&gt; either faith or doubt.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; Now in the realm of doubt is where the
[13:25] worries come, the anxiety comes, the
[13:27] anxiousness comes.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; And all those kind of things. So if
[13:31] we're operating in that, we are
[13:32] operating in the flesh.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But in the realm of the spirit, it
[13:37] says it's faith. We walk not after the
[13:39] flesh.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; So where do we carry this billionaire
[13:42] faith
[13:44] &gt;&gt; in our souls?
[13:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; How many faith billionaires are here?
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Faith billionaires.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Faith billionaires can call things from
[13:58] the unseen realm into the seen realm.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Faith billionaires. If you want to be a
[14:06] national millionaire, billionaire,
[14:07] &gt;&gt; you first need to be a faith
[14:09] billionaire.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; You first got to operate in the things
[14:12] of God.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; You first got to make God show see that
[14:16] you are trustworthy.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; How many of you know if in the realm of
[14:20] finances, how many of you know if you
[14:23] want to understand what God can trust
[14:25] you with?
[14:26] &gt;&gt; How many of you know what what level God
[14:29] can trust you with? We work in South
[14:30] Africa here. We work in the realm of
[14:32] rents.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; In God's eyes, do you know how much he
[14:35] can trust you with?
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; How many of you want me to tell you?
[14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; But look at what you earning.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; That's how much God can trust you with.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; Everyone understand?
[14:51] &gt;&gt; At this current level, that's all God
[14:53] can trust you with.
[14:55] Now, when he gives you that,
[14:59] we've got to know how to apply it.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Now, God is look in the kingdom of God,
[15:08] God is a businessman. In the kingdom,
[15:10] when Jesus is giving his parables, he's
[15:12] looking for ROA or ROI, return on
[15:15] investment.
[15:17] He's looking that whatever he's given
[15:19] you, there's there's in numerous stories
[15:21] in the Bible that when he comes back,
[15:23] he's looking for return on investment.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; It's there in Matthew 25.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; He's there when he's talking about how
[15:30] he he he this king, Amen, uh uh left out
[15:33] his vineyard or his husbandry, amen, to
[15:36] people and then he even sent servants
[15:38] and they killed the servants. Then he
[15:39] sent his son, they killed the sons, then
[15:40] he went himself.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; He was looking for return on investment.
[15:44] Amen. [clears throat]
[15:44] &gt;&gt; Now, God wants to multiply and grow
[15:47] whatever he has given you.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Because God wants to bless you
[15:52] exceedingly abundantly above all that
[15:54] you can ask or think.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; So, in the stewardship he's given you,
[15:58] he needs you to invest it wisely back
[16:02] into the things of God. That's why he's
[16:04] got Luke 6:38 there.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; You can't receive what you don't give.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we also got to be
[16:14] careful in how we handle the things of
[16:17] God. And do you know people are so
[16:19] consumed with voices?
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Voices
[16:22] &gt;&gt; they can't determine which is the spirit
[16:24] of God speaking to them.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of God is speaking to
[16:27] us.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; And he is giving us instruction.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; And he's telling us, you know what? You
[16:32] are my disciple. You are my steward, my
[16:34] leg on the earth, my feet on the earth.
[16:36] I need you to go and do this for this
[16:37] brother.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because people are praying to God
[16:43] in heaven thinking that their out is
[16:45] going to come from heaven but God is
[16:47] going to steward his people on the earth
[16:49] his hands and his feet.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Now we shut out these voices and when we
[16:53] shut out these voices we are cutting off
[16:55] our blessing.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Part of stewardship is also knowing how
[17:02] to receive.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; And we find in the early years of the
[17:06] prophet's ministry, I love the prophet
[17:08] because he's very honest. Yeah.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; In the early years of the prophet's
[17:11] ministry, he didn't understand how to
[17:13] receive.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Until he got into problems with his
[17:17] ministry in terms of finances and he
[17:20] wanted to leave the field because he
[17:22] said to the Lord, "If I ever can't pay
[17:24] the bills, I'll leave quit the
[17:25] ministry."
[17:26] &gt;&gt; He was putting unnecessary pressure.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Now, if people are only reading the
[17:31] first part of the ministry and the first
[17:34] part of the sports, they'll only attach
[17:35] to that and they'll look down upon
[17:37] giving.
[17:39] But then the Lord tells him the people
[17:41] need to have a part in the meeting.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; You're cutting off their supply and
[17:45] their blessing as well.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; So
[17:47] &gt;&gt; yes, the Bible does say it is better to
[17:49] give than to receive.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; But receiving is also important
[17:53] &gt;&gt; because yeah, I I I can't remember the
[17:56] exact quote right now, but the prophet
[17:57] of God says a man came to him and wanted
[17:59] to give him an offering and he said no.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "But brother, you are
[18:04] robbing me of my blessing.
[18:07] But you're not receiving what I am
[18:09] giving to you. You are robbing me of my
[18:11] blessing.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Then the prophet says, "Oh, I never
[18:14] swear that way."
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That's right.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; So Luke 6:38 says, "What does he start
[18:20] out with?
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Take,
[18:24] &gt;&gt; take,
[18:26] &gt;&gt; take,
[18:28] &gt;&gt; receive."
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Sorry,
[18:33] &gt;&gt; some of you choking the sh.
[18:36] Come on now. [laughter]
[18:38] &gt;&gt; What does he say?
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Give
[18:42] &gt;&gt; and then it will be given you.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Now the promise of God can never fail.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Give
[18:51] &gt;&gt; it shall be given you
[18:54] &gt;&gt; good measure.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; See, Sister Kim loves this kind of
[18:57] message because she came out now. You
[18:58] see the jump with you in trouble. She's
[19:00] going to ask today. It shall be given to
[19:03] you good measure. My father don't give
[19:05] half measure.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; My father gives good measure.
[19:08] [applause and cheering]
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; You know when you're packing a suitcase,
[19:12] money is light.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; It can rise very quickly. So he presses
[19:16] it down.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; You reading with me?
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Press it down,
[19:22] &gt;&gt; shaken together,
[19:24] &gt;&gt; and running over shall give to you.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. Who blessed Abraham? Go read
[19:31] the Bible carefully. Wherever whichever
[19:33] country people were you went to
[19:35] &gt;&gt; they started to bless him with cattle
[19:37] with things and all of that
[19:39] &gt;&gt; shall who give to you
[19:40] &gt;&gt; men
[19:41] &gt;&gt; men give into your bosom
[19:43] &gt;&gt; now we are of the understanding that we
[19:46] are employed by a boss
[19:49] &gt;&gt; and that our source if we are I'm trying
[19:52] to shift your understanding this morning
[19:53] that if we are thinking that our source
[19:55] comes from the company we work from we
[19:57] are sorry mistaken
[20:00] &gt;&gt; what your company identified is that you
[20:02] possess a certain skill,
[20:04] &gt;&gt; a certain talent.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; So they are buying your service,
[20:08] &gt;&gt; you don't work for them.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; They make it seem like you work for
[20:12] them. But what they are really doing is
[20:14] paying you for your service, for your
[20:16] skill, for your understanding, which
[20:17] came from where?
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Let's break it down further.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; You think you got that skill and
[20:25] understanding by yourself?
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Who gave you the knowledge to learn?
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Who gave you the ability? who gave you
[20:30] the good health.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE REALLY TRACE IT BACK, OUR
[20:33] SOURCE IS
[20:34] &gt;&gt; ABA.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; OUR SOURCE IS GOD.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Because he gave me the breath of life.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Who is Moses Corporation?
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Who is Renault?
[20:49] &gt;&gt; They're not my source.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; God used his men
[20:56] &gt;&gt; to give into your bosom.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Can we shift mindsets?
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; No, you are not governed by the contract
[21:07] you sign.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; They wrote there, we'll consider an
[21:14] increase after 3 years. No.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; You can approach the courts of heaven.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; You've got a higher power and a higher
[21:27] source.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:29] That's right.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Someone's not believing me yet.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I don't see everyone connecting
[21:35] here this morning.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; You've got a higher power and a higher
[21:41] source.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; You're not governed by local contracts
[21:44] written by men.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; I was sharing on Wednesday in the
[21:48] ranking of the spirit realm, it's God.
[21:51] Highest authority.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Highest authority.
[21:56] Lowest authority is who?
[22:00] &gt;&gt; The men of the earth.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Unsaved.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; They possess no rank, no authority.
[22:07] Demon powers possess more rank than
[22:09] them. That's why they possess them.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Everyone understanding?
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; So the highest is God. The lowest is the
[22:18] unsaved man, fallen man.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Above fallen man is demon powers. Above
[22:26] demon powers is angelic beings
[22:29] &gt;&gt; and above angelic beings are sons and
[22:31] daughters of God.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; You go read what the prophet of God
[22:34] says. HE SAYS WHO IS MORE POWERFUL, an
[22:37] angel or a son of God.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS A SON OF GOD.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT YOU'RE A SON OF
[22:43] GOD? A DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; So the kind of faith we are looking for
[22:52] was found Amen. In Galatians, I don't
[22:55] know why we went off in this direction.
[22:56] I wasn't going to go off in this
[22:57] tangent. We're talking about faith, the
[22:59] world of perfect faith.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [crying]
[23:03] &gt;&gt; It says Galatians 2:20, I have been
[23:05] crucified with Christ. So, you can't
[23:06] find the old me. Nevertheless, I live,
[23:09] but not I, but Christ liveth in me. And
[23:12] the life which I now live in the flesh,
[23:14] I live by the faith of the Son of God,
[23:17] who loved me and gave himself for me.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[23:27] Now this kind of faith that we are
[23:28] talking about
[23:31] I just want to read what the prophet of
[23:32] God is saying here.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you love the prophet
[23:35] of God?
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[23:40] So he says here in the in the message
[23:42] perfect faith he's talking about Jesus
[23:46] right?
[23:48] Jesus had faith with his power. Remember
[23:52] last week we took this word power and we
[23:54] determined that in the Greek it's
[23:56] authority.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND EARTH
[24:00] IS GIVEN to me.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; He had faith with his power.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; Now the authority has been put into the
[24:08] people but what we are looking for the
[24:10] people to come INTO AND RAISE UP INTO
[24:12] FAITH.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; TO OPERATE THE AUTHORITY.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; YES.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; He said we read the scripture Wednesday
[24:19] too St. John 5:19. I can do nothing in
[24:22] myself. Why? He relied upon what he was.
[24:26] This is the crux of today's message. And
[24:28] so pay attention now.
[24:32] How did Jesus have faith?
[24:35] &gt;&gt; He relied
[24:37] on what
[24:39] &gt;&gt; he was.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, rely on what you
[24:47] want.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Okay? Say it after me. rely
[24:50] &gt;&gt; on what God made you to be.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; What God made you to be
[24:54] &gt;&gt; that now puts you into another realm.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what the problem
[24:59] with message people is? Message people
[25:02] believe everything written about Moses.
[25:07] They believe everything written about
[25:08] Elijah.
[25:10] They believe everything written about
[25:11] the prophets.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; They believe everything written about
[25:14] William Branom. Some have spent maybe
[25:16] their life's work to study and analyze
[25:19] the ministry of this great prophetic
[25:21] ministry.
[25:23] It's their life's work. 40 years they've
[25:25] spent trying to analyze how did God use
[25:27] this man in such a mighty way.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to understanding what
[25:32] God said about you,
[25:35] &gt;&gt; what God made you,
[25:37] &gt;&gt; people are poor in faith with that.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:42] [crying]
[25:45] He relied on what he was.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. [crying]
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; He relied in knowing that he was the
[25:55] word.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Are we the word made fresh? Now
[26:00] &gt;&gt; we must rely that we are the word now.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; He has faith in God who made him the
[26:08] word.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:11] Have faith in that God made us the word
[26:13] for this day.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; He was God the word and they was in him
[26:21] and that gave him faith because he
[26:25] understood his
[26:29] [snorts]
[26:29] &gt;&gt; what gave him faith. Please walk with
[26:32] me.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[26:33] &gt;&gt; It's a very simple message this morning.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; He understood his position. Yes.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; So understanding our position gives us a
[26:41] certain kind of faith.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; Understanding who we ARE WILL GIVE US
[26:45] UNSHAKABLE FAITH.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; He know what he was because the
[26:52] scripture had said he was this.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; So we have got to know what the
[26:58] scripture says concerning us.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Then our faith becomes unshakable.
[27:05] And here every scripture tied in to
[27:07] prove that he was exactly what the
[27:09] scripture said he would be and he knew
[27:12] what he was.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Now, if we've never operated in this
[27:20] level of faith or understanding, it's
[27:22] time we go and we study what the
[27:24] scriptures say about us.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; What the scriptures say concerning us.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; You see, we need to be like Simeon.
[27:30] Simeon wasn't like
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Simeon. I'm talking about Simeon in the
[27:36] Bible now who was waiting at the temple
[27:38] for Jesus.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Do you know no prophet prophesied about
[27:42] it?
[27:47] &gt;&gt; There was nothing in the Bible that he
[27:49] could show the people. I'm waiting here
[27:51] according to this promise.
[27:54] It says the Holy Ghost revealed to
[27:56] Simeon,
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah,
[27:58] &gt;&gt; that he must stand in the temple.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Sons of God are led by the
[28:05] &gt;&gt; spirit of God.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; So he's going to reveal things in the
[28:09] word and we are also going to be led by
[28:12] the spirit.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; In this present time and season,
[28:16] &gt;&gt; amen. Amen.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knowed what he was because the
[28:22] scripture said he was this. And here
[28:25] every scripture tied in to prove that he
[28:27] was exactly what the scripture said he
[28:29] would be. And he knew what he was.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Do we know what we are?
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Do we know who we are?
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Do we know who lives in us? Do we know
[28:39] what faith operates in us?
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we also have to have the
[28:43] scriptural backing.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; So go and make this your study for the
[28:48] week. Write down every scripture that
[28:50] pertains to you. Write down every verse
[28:52] that pertains to you.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; That becomes what the word says about
[28:55] you
[28:56] &gt;&gt; that positions you
[28:58] &gt;&gt; that releases to you a certain faith
[29:00] because faith cometh by the hearing.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; You will receive a certain kind of a
[29:06] faith understanding the prophetic
[29:08] ministry.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. But when you if you want TO UNLOCK
[29:11] A GREATER level of faith.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Wednesday I was talking about Joseph.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Do you know there are levels of faith
[29:21] and circumstances that can restrict at
[29:24] what level you operate at?
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; When he was in his father's house, he
[29:30] couldn't operate in the gifting and the
[29:32] anointing that was locked up in Joseph.
[29:34] Yes,
[29:36] &gt;&gt; IT WAS SUPPRESSED BECAUSE HE WAS A
[29:38] SPOILED BOY.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; YEAH,
[29:39] &gt;&gt; they didn't require him to do anything.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even allowed to go with his
[29:43] brothers to take care of the sheep
[29:45] &gt;&gt; and the cattle.
[29:47] But God would now create circumstances
[29:48] and opportunities to position him in
[29:51] part of his house.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; But in part of his house, HE COULD ONLY
[29:54] UNLEASH A CERTAIN level of his ability
[29:57] and whatever anointing he had within
[29:59] him.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:01] He couldn't unleash his full potential
[30:03] in part of his house.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; When they put him in the prison, it
[30:08] unlocked another level and a dimension
[30:13] of faith within him of anointing within
[30:15] him. But he couldn't unleash his full
[30:18] potential.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; But when he was raised out of that
[30:21] prison,
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; and put there at THE RIGHT HAND OF
[30:24] PHARAOH,
[30:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; AND he was TOLD THAT, AMEN. YOUR WORD
[30:27] WILL BE
[30:28] &gt;&gt; SOUNDING THROUGHOUT ALL KINGDOMS. AMEN.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; And there's no one's WORD ABOVE YOURS
[30:32] EXCEPT MINE.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; THEN JOSEPH COULD NOW UNLEASH HIS FULL
[30:37] POTENTIAL.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; HE HAD CONTROL OVER EVERYTHING.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; You go read Genesis 47. Joseph had
[30:44] control over everything.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; They first came to Joseph and they tell
[30:48] Joseph, "We have need of grain." He
[30:51] says, "Well, you can buy it." When money
[30:53] failed and all their money was gone,
[30:55] they said, "Well, what good? Our money
[30:57] is now gone and now we're going to
[30:59] perish." She said, "Joseph, we can't
[31:01] hide from you.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; You've got to present yourself to God's
[31:05] provided way.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; God's provided way in this time and
[31:09] season is you and I."
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Every demon power must come subject to
[31:17] you.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[31:18] &gt;&gt; you go and read Genesis 47. Every single
[31:21] person came subject to Joseph.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; All things were under his feet.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:26] Last week, Sunday we were talking about
[31:28] that that all things have been put under
[31:29] our feet.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; They even told Joseph, you know what?
[31:32] What good is our lives? Let us sell our
[31:34] lives to you.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; They sold their lands to him. They sold
[31:38] their cattle to him. And they said, we
[31:40] will become your servant. But Joseph now
[31:43] who is positioned there for the
[31:45] prosperity of the people. People people
[31:49] get nervous when you use the word
[31:50] prosperity. Do you know what the word
[31:52] prosperity means?
[31:56] to thrive.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; To thrive.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; So I need that's that is why John in one
[32:04] one John there the apostle Paul is
[32:07] apostle John is saying beloved I wish
[32:10] that above all things that you would
[32:12] prosper
[32:13] &gt;&gt; and be in health even as your
[32:19] &gt;&gt; so your soul must thrive.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:24] Your soul must have abundance of what?
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; We just detailed a while ago that in the
[32:29] soul resides what? Faith.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; So in your soul, YOU MUST BE VERY
[32:34] PROSPEROUS.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF FAITH IN
[32:39] YOUR SOUL.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Because what did we where did we
[32:43] determine the container that's storing
[32:44] this faith that's generated?
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; In the soul.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Did we find the scripture?
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Beloved, I wish above all things
[32:53] that thou mayest prosper and be in
[32:55] health even as thy soul.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; So soul prosperity means there's an
[33:00] abundance of faith being generated in
[33:02] your soul.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; When somebody is saying even as meaning
[33:08] that the first two things depends on
[33:10] that last thing.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Everybody understand that?
[33:14] &gt;&gt; The first two are conditional based on
[33:16] the prosperity of the soul.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I would say this that the level
[33:21] of your prosperity in your health
[33:24] and prosper in all things depends on
[33:27] what kind of status you have in your
[33:29] soul in terms of faith.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; If your bank balance in your faith realm
[33:34] in your soul is zero.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; You're going to have zero prosperity in
[33:39] all things
[33:40] &gt;&gt; and zero prosperity in your health.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It says, "Even as your soul
[33:47] prospers, even as you gain this
[33:49] abundance of faith, even as you come
[33:51] into perfect faith,
[33:53] &gt;&gt; I want you to prosper in all things."
[33:55] Now, please don't put limitations on
[33:57] all.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, "Stop being an
[33:59] unbeliever." Come on. I want you to tell
[34:01] them
[34:03] &gt;&gt; not only on your left, sister. Tell them
[34:05] on your right. Everyone left and right.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Some of you are afraid because you know
[34:08] the negativity is on this side here. So,
[34:10] you only go where you know the problem
[34:12] is.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Nobody's talking to Caleb yet. You told
[34:21] Hey,
[34:26] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[34:30] The problem is not in heaven.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Where's the problem?
[34:34] &gt;&gt; The problem is on the earth.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; And the problem is sitting I won't tell
[34:38] you which side of you.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; It could be left, right, or inside.
[34:43] Right? So I won't tell you which side.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; So the prophet of God now is saying, how
[34:51] far did we get down that boat, brother?
[34:55] &gt;&gt; So we determined that there's another
[34:58] level of faith unleashed to us when we
[35:01] know who we are and what the word says
[35:02] about us. How many of you will go and
[35:04] make it your week's uh lesson to go and
[35:07] write down all the scriptures that
[35:09] pertain to you?
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. because that's going to unleash
[35:12] another level of faith.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Uh let's go to 65.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; 65.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Therefore, if he relying
[35:25] on it upon what God had made him and if
[35:29] he did that, then why can't we rely on
[35:32] what God made us as believers?
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Why can't we rely on that?
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:42] These signs shall follow them that
[35:44] believe. He had faith in what he was.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; And if you as a believer, you have faith
[35:52] in what you are. You are a believer. And
[35:55] if you've got faith in God, the Bible
[35:57] says it over in here. You see what you
[35:59] need to do? Know the scriptural
[36:01] reference.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; He's trying to tell you, you've got to
[36:04] know the word.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; What the word says about you. Then you
[36:08] go put that authority
[36:10] &gt;&gt; on the word.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Brandham says vision
[36:14] is not above the word.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Gifts are not above the word.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; He says if a vision or something tells
[36:19] you contrary to the word he says you
[36:21] leave that and you stay with the word.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; So you've got to have he says pay
[36:29] attention to this because message people
[36:30] are the most illiterate when it comes to
[36:32] knowing the scriptures. They know
[36:33] quotes.
[36:36] They know quotes.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; They can tell you quote, page number,
[36:40] this, that, paragraph, everything. But
[36:42] when it comes to the word, the written
[36:43] word.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; They'll say, you know, somewhere it's
[36:46] written over there. Where? Somewhere.
[36:50] Tell me the scripture. Quote me the
[36:52] scripture. Because here he's telling
[36:54] you, if you've got faith in God, the
[36:56] Bible says over in, and he puts that dot
[36:59] dot dot. He wants you to fill in the
[37:00] blank.
[37:03] Let's move on brother. If our hearts
[37:06] condemn us there, it brings another
[37:08] element now right. People can't operate.
[37:10] You know, we exclude oursel from things
[37:12] and blessings of God. We say, "Oh,
[37:14] brother, you know, I'm not right, so I
[37:15] can't come to church.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; You're operating on your own strength."
[37:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; If we could ever do anything for
[37:23] ourselves, then Jesus didn't need to
[37:25] come.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; You know, bro, things are not right.
[37:30] I think I'll just stay at home until
[37:32] things come right.
[37:35] Hey, you got another quartet. You better
[37:37] than he ever knew because you feel you
[37:40] can operate our own power and make
[37:41] things right within yourselves.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus already made things right for you.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; You need to submit to his plan, to his
[37:47] purpose, to his will and everything.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; He has made all things new.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; He has made all things right.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; If our hearts condemn us, then we can't
[37:56] have faith. But if our hearts don't
[37:58] condemn us, then we have faith. If we
[38:01] have confidence towards God,
[38:03] then you see, brother Brandon knows the
[38:05] scripture too. If you want to find, read
[38:07] that. It's found in St. John 3:21. I've
[38:10] got the scripture written down there.
[38:12] Notice, I mean, it's 1 John 3:21.
[38:16] If our hearts condemn us not, we have
[38:18] confidence towards God.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But as long as you're doing things
[38:24] that's wrong,
[38:27] &gt;&gt; you can't have confidence towards God.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; You'll automatically know you're wrong.
[38:34] Now, that that uh prick in your heart to
[38:36] know that you're wrong is a good thing.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; It shows that your conscience has not
[38:39] been seared with a hot iron.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; And you can still come under conviction
[38:43] of the word.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; The thing to do there is repent.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Repent means to turn away.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; You'll automatically know you're wrong.
[38:52] You're automatically putting yourself
[38:53] back there as a sinner by knowing that
[38:55] you're wrong.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; But when your heart down don't condemn
[38:59] you. You know you're a believer. There's
[39:01] nothing between you and God. You can ask
[39:04] what you will and know that it'll be
[39:08] given.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Because it's the word that's given to
[39:13] you just like it was to those disciples.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:20] Now the only thing you have to do then
[39:22] is have faith in what the Bram is.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Have faith in what Moses is.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. Have faith in somebody else.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; But then why we are so affected by what
[39:34] other people do? You know they hurt me
[39:36] so bad over there. I can't go there.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; They hurt my feelings.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; So that person you got you had you know
[39:44] they you know I put so much confidence
[39:47] in them.
[39:49] How many of you heard people talk like
[39:51] that?
[39:53] &gt;&gt; I put my trust in them.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Who told you to put your trust in man?
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Who told you to PUT YOUR TRUST IN SOME
[40:00] PASTOR? WHO TOLD YOU TO PUT YOUR TRUST
[40:02] IN SOME DEACON? WHO TOLD YOU TO put your
[40:04] trust IN ANYONE? PUT YOUR TRUST IN the
[40:06] Lord.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; TRUST IN THE LORD with all your heart.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; So many people stop going to church
[40:12] because they associate their hurt
[40:15] feelings now to that person to this
[40:17] world. That's why I can't go there.
[40:18] You're operating on the wrong level
[40:20] straight away. It says here,
[40:22] &gt;&gt; the only thing you have to do is have
[40:24] faith in what you are,
[40:27] &gt;&gt; not what the next person did,
[40:31] &gt;&gt; have faith in what the word says you
[40:34] are.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; And Jesus had faith in the word of God
[40:39] that said he it is written of me. Oh
[40:42] yeah.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; You see, WHEN WE COME WITH THIS KIND OF
[40:43] UNDERSTANDING,
[40:44] &gt;&gt; LO, I COME IN THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "LO, I COME IN THE VOLUME OF
[40:51] THE BOOK."
[40:52] &gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE YOU TO REVELATION 10 AND I'LL
[40:54] SHOW YOU WHERE THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK
[40:55] CAME DOWN TO THE EARTH.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; AND THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK WAS PUT INTO
[40:59] MAN.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK, YOU WERE GIVEN
[41:02] AN INVITATION TO COME AND EAT THE BOOK.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Consume the book.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; So the volume OF THE BOOK IS WHERE?
[41:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So when YOU COME BEFORE A
[41:10] SITUATION, BEFORE YOUR LIFE PROBLEMS,
[41:12] YOU CAN SAY, "LO, I COME IN THE VOLUME
[41:14] OF THE BOOK. IT IS WRITTEN OF ME."
[41:16] [cheering]
[41:16] &gt;&gt; LORD, [applause]
[41:18] thank you Lord.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Didn't David in the Psalms and the
[41:23] prophets and all of them speak of him. I
[41:25] am the bread of life that came from God
[41:27] out of heaven. I [clears throat] am the
[41:28] tree of life. I am all these. I am that
[41:31] I am.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Do you know God is still I am.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:37] Do you know why I am is manifesting
[41:39] right now?
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; That's what Christ the mystery OF GOD IS
[41:45] ALL ABOUT.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; I AM IS STILL BEING MANIFESTED. THAT'S
[41:48] WHY HE NEVER ATTACHED A NAME TO I AM.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. AMEN.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Because now I am is in a many MEMBERED
[41:55] BODY.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; I AM THAT I am.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; He knew with that perfect faith that he
[42:02] was the anointed Messiah. Messiah means
[42:05] Christ.
[42:07] anointed one
[42:09] &gt;&gt; that the spirit of God was upon him. Now
[42:12] he said now I in myself do nothing but
[42:15] it's my faith in God and God was in him
[42:17] the word made manifest and when the word
[42:19] of God comes in
[42:21] &gt;&gt; you.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody say me.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; It made it's made manifest for you a
[42:27] believer and a believer is the faith of
[42:29] God that moves in you.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; You are not operating with human faith.
[42:34] Yes. Yes.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; It says the faith of God is moving in
[42:36] you.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; So allow the faith of God to HAVE
[42:38] EXPRESSION.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; ALLOW THE FAITH OF GOD TO HAVE
[42:41] EXPRESSION.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; YES.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's move. Amen. You
[42:46] like that.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; How many of you like that?
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; He says, I like when you like it. Amen.
[42:52] I like teaching of where, how, to, what
[42:54] faith really is.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; So stop studying about every other
[43:00] person and start studying what the
[43:01] scripture says about you. Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; That's going to release your faith.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; What faith is that? God's faith in you.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; God's faith working through you.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Knowing who he was without a shadow of a
[43:16] doubt. He knew he was the son of God. He
[43:18] knew it. For the word identified, the
[43:20] word of God identified who he was. He
[43:22] said, "If I do not the works of my
[43:24] father, then don't believe me. If I
[43:26] don't do them works, don't believe me.
[43:29] But if I do, then believe the works for
[43:31] they are the manifested pro word
[43:34] promised. Or if you could just wake up
[43:36] to that those sleeping just wake up. The
[43:38] prophet is trying to call you here.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Some of you say you don't speak through
[43:41] the books and TJ is calling you.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, if you could just wake up
[43:47] to that a minute." You see the word
[43:50] itself identified who he was. Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[43:58] Who can condemn me of sin? Now, if you
[44:00] take Romans 8:1, you can also say, "Who
[44:02] can condemn me of sin?"
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:1 said, "There's thou therefore
[44:06] no condemnation."
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; We read that.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; So, you can stand with that same
[44:13] scriptural authority. WHO CAN CONDEMN ME
[44:15] OF SIN?
[44:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Not everyone's believing that. WHO CAN
[44:21] CONDEMN ME OF SIN?
[44:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:25] IN OTHER WORDS, who can show that my
[44:27] life and my works don't fulfill exactly
[44:29] what the Messiah should do? Now, this is
[44:32] where we got a problem, right? This is
[44:35] where we got a problem because he's
[44:37] saying the works
[44:40] and his life fulfill exactly what
[44:42] Messiah should do. Now, we got a problem
[44:45] here because the prophet of the hour
[44:47] said detailed what the bride would be.
[44:49] Should be an invincible army.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Should be a super church. should be a
[44:53] super race.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; But we seem to have a problem because
[44:56] the works and the life are not matching.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; So we need some spiritual diagnostics.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; To identify the problem
[45:05] &gt;&gt; and do a service and a fix.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; And that's what the service is about
[45:09] this morning.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; How to operate in that perfect faith.
[45:13] Know what the word SAYS ABOUT YOU. KNOW
[45:15] YOUR SCRIPTURES. Know what it says about
[45:17] you.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Allow the faith of God to move in you.
[45:21] Then you'll see super church, super
[45:23] race. You'll see invincible army
[45:26] &gt;&gt; because it's not based upon the bride's
[45:28] EARTHLY MINISTRY. IT'S GOD WORKING
[45:30] THROUGH THE BRIDE.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Nobody could say nothing for he was.
[45:40] Then he had faith to believe then
[45:41] whatever he said it would happen. How
[45:43] many of you want to rise to that level
[45:44] of faith?
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; That you can't do nothing but what God
[45:48] speaks through you. that whatever you
[45:50] say happens.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; But that's the WORLD OF PERFECT FAITH WE
[45:55] ARE TALKING ABOUT.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; That's heavenly places.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; I want to when I speak I I WANT TO HAVE
[46:00] SUCH CONFIDENCE. I WANT IT TO HAPPEN
[46:02] THEN AND THERE.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Then he turned around and said, "The
[46:11] works that I do shall you do also."
[46:13] &gt;&gt; You watch Brother
[46:15] through this port now. He's contrasting
[46:17] Jesus and he's bringing it back to you.
[46:18] Jesus. And he's bringing it back to you.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Because the head and the body are one.
[46:23] Last week's sermon.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Head and body are one.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; The works that I do shall you do also. A
[46:30] little while and the world seeth me no
[46:32] more. Yet you shall see me. Yet you
[46:34] shall because I'll be with you even in
[46:37] you.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Take no thought what
[46:40] you shall see. For it's not you that
[46:43] speak, it's thy father that dwelleth in
[46:45] you.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:47] He's the one who does the speaking and
[46:49] it's not me. It's the father that
[46:51] dwelleth in me. He doeth the work. See
[46:53] what I mean?
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next one. Amen.
[47:08] He says, "Could you compare Christian
[47:10] today with them Christians of long ago?
[47:13] how the disciples walked in the power of
[47:15] the spirit, moved by the Holy Ghost,
[47:17] just a prisoner, as I preached the other
[47:19] night, a prisoner to the word and will
[47:21] of God. He couldn't even move until God
[47:24] moved him.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you like to see a church
[47:28] rise like that?
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; It's going to.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; It's got to come.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's on the road now, I
[47:38] believe.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:40] For the word identify himself, what he
[47:43] was, and the same word identifies us.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; If a man loves me, he keeps my
[47:50] commandments.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:52] Praise the Lord. Let's go to 76. Then if
[47:56] you abide in me and my word abide in
[47:59] you, so the word must be in you.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:06] You abide in me, my word abide in you.
[48:08] Then ask what you will. He knew who he
[48:11] was. Therefore, he had faith. Faith can
[48:13] produce when he know what he was. Now,
[48:15] if you abide in me and my word abide in
[48:18] you, then you know who you are. Ask what
[48:21] you will. It'll be given you.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[48:26] The prophet of God in the next part now
[48:28] as I'm speaking this, I want you to be
[48:31] able to confess this. Watch what he's
[48:33] saying now and watch how the spirit is
[48:35] moving because right now things are
[48:37] going to shift in your life. Something
[48:39] tells me that tonight's the end of your
[48:40] suffering.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; It's ending right now.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[48:46] &gt;&gt; you're going to do it. You'll go away
[48:49] here with something. Some of you, you're
[48:51] going away from here with something.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; You are not going away from here with
[48:54] nothing.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; No matter how much you come in emotion,
[49:02] how much you do that it won't work. SO
[49:03] DON'T COME AND CRY TEARS. HEAVEN IS NOT
[49:06] MOVED. THE COURTS OF HEAVEN ARE NOT
[49:07] MOVED BY TEARS.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; YES.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; It's moved BY FAITH.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; FOR SOME of you that don't know, right
[49:13] now it's 11:23
[49:16] &gt;&gt; right now. And that's why I say watch
[49:17] how the spirit is working to bring this
[49:19] in to watch. It's not moved by tears. It
[49:22] won't work until that perfect faith has
[49:24] manifested and identified itself in you
[49:28] &gt;&gt; as substance. Then nothing's going to
[49:30] shake you from it. Speak right now.
[49:33] Every sickness has to go. Every disease
[49:35] has to go. Every problem has to leave
[49:37] right now. But don't only speak out of
[49:39] existence. Speak into existence
[49:40] according to Romans 4:17. You call those
[49:43] things which are not as though they are.
[49:45] Hallelujah.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. He says here if you had
[49:49] cancer the doctor told you you'd be dead
[49:52] before Monday morning your heart your
[49:54] respiration gone cancer's eating you up
[49:56] bloodstream become completely cancer
[49:58] something come with the substance of
[50:00] this genuine faith perfect faith was
[50:02] made substance in you'd say [laughter]
[50:08] &gt;&gt; where you going to laugh
[50:13] &gt;&gt; hey I'm looking for some John Ryan here
[50:15] &gt;&gt; who's got doctor's ointment.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to go home and practice to
[50:19] laugh
[50:20] &gt;&gt; because you need to know how to laugh in
[50:22] his face now.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; What he says you'll do
[50:27] &gt;&gt; where
[50:28] &gt;&gt; in the car when you go back in the car?
[50:31] &gt;&gt; You laugh in his face. Were you giving a
[50:33] testimony last week, brother Amish?
[50:35] You're going for what test?
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; And you call those things which are not
[50:39] as though they are. You said all test
[50:40] will come back clear.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; And his test results came back clear.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen.
[50:45] How many of you here as a testimony were
[50:48] prayed for or you believed and had faith
[50:51] when you went to the doctor all your
[50:52] test results came clear? Stand up or
[50:54] raise your hand.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Let me see.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Raise them high. I want the people who
[50:58] don't see the witness.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; When you went for the test results, all
[51:02] came back clear.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; He says you must laugh in the doctor's
[51:10] face.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; You know what else? You can laugh at
[51:13] your zero bank balance.
[51:16] [laughter]
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Faith is a principle. It's a law.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; You can,
[51:26] &gt;&gt; come on, people of God.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; The same faith you have for Rafa, you
[51:29] must have for
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Gyra.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; So if you can laugh at sickness,
[51:33] &gt;&gt; you can laugh at zero bank balance.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Because when you see it there,
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; you must be dyslexic.
[51:42] You must see numbers that you can't
[51:44] that's not even there.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; That's how faith operates.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; You must be able to see numbers that's
[51:49] not even there.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; You must be able to see sales that's not
[51:52] even there.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; You must be able to see people coming to
[51:54] support your business that's not even
[51:56] there.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Do you know people are buying stuff?
[52:02] &gt;&gt; So you are going to summon the courts of
[52:04] heaven that they must now buy from you.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat]
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE BUYING STUFF. YEAH,
[52:10] &gt;&gt; they're buying it all everywhere.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; We are going to pray uncommon favor now
[52:16] &gt;&gt; that they all directed to you.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; What you need to do? Be able to handle
[52:20] the capacity.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Don't pray for stuff and you can't
[52:22] handle it now. You're fumbling the oil.
[52:24] You're in a way. No, if you're asking
[52:26] God for something then otherwise what
[52:28] he's going to do release little by
[52:29] little until you can handle it.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; So that's why preparation for what you
[52:36] are asking is very important. Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; If you are praying the Lord, expand my
[52:41] business, expand my business, and you're
[52:43] there in a one uh small office over
[52:45] there, but you need a factory maybe
[52:48] &gt;&gt; to handle what God's going to give you.
[52:50] You know, Jabas, when he asked the Lord
[52:52] &gt;&gt; in 1 Chronicles chapter 4, he had the
[52:55] capacity to handle what he was asking
[52:56] God for.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Enlarge my borders,
[53:01] enlarge my territory," he wasn't asking
[53:03] God just for fancy. He knew that he had
[53:06] the potential to handle it. You see when
[53:10] is when I was asking here and I was
[53:12] actually going to say this but brother
[53:14] Sunonny confirmed it to me outside when
[53:16] I asked whoa wants to be a millionaire
[53:18] only brother Sunonny raised his hand
[53:21] and my next words going to follow I said
[53:23] I know what you're going to do with that
[53:24] million brother Sunonny but as soon as I
[53:26] stepped out there he told me what he
[53:28] confirmed it
[53:30] &gt;&gt; he said I want the million to give it
[53:32] back to the gospel
[53:35] &gt;&gt; but that's the right attitude
[53:37] &gt;&gt; that's the right motive
[53:39] Hallelujah.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Now, let's take it to souls.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; God don't want you to die and go to
[53:46] heaven alone.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be a witness and take
[53:51] someone with you.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; People love that thing. Amen. I came
[53:55] into this world with nothing. I'll go
[53:56] with nothing. Hey, take someone with
[53:58] you.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Give God praise. Amen.
[54:02] Hallelujah. [applause]
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Don't be selfish. Okay,
[54:07] &gt;&gt; have a concern.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; I've just given you the key in this very
[54:12] simple message is how to operate on a
[54:14] higher dimension of faith and level of
[54:16] faith is by knowing what the word says
[54:18] about you.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; In all the years in the message, do you
[54:21] know the scriptures concerning yourself?
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Do [clears throat] you know where we are
[54:25] in that part of scripture?
[54:27] &gt;&gt; When you're reading Revelation 10, we
[54:28] didn't have time to go into it. Reading
[54:30] Revelation 10 1-1 there, do you know
[54:33] which part of that plan we are in? Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Are we still waiting for the mighty
[54:38] angel to come down with the open book?
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Are we still waiting for Revelation 10:7
[54:42] to sound?
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Are we still waiting for the angel to
[54:45] tell us come take the book?
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Are we still on our way to take the
[54:49] book?
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Or have we taken the book and eaten it?
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; And are we now standing and prophesying
[54:54] again? Which part? We determine which
[54:56] part we are in.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Where are we? Know what the word says
[55:03] about us. Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; So, next next service, what we're going
[55:06] to do is we're going to have a quiz
[55:07] &gt;&gt; and we're going to ask you to tell us
[55:09] scriptures that's concerning you,
[55:11] &gt;&gt; concerning us,
[55:13] &gt;&gt; what's the scripture saying about me?
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet is saying that's how
[55:18] to now position ourselves in that world
[55:20] of perfect faith.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; To know what the word says about us.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; So, did everyone hear that?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; We're going to do a general discussion
[55:32] and a quiz to ask you what the word says
[55:34] about you.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; And then you must give me your
[55:37] scripture,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; brother. Here in the scripture, it says
[55:39] this about me. Here it is written of me.
[55:42] Here it is written of me. Praise the
[55:45] Lord.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of you think by looking side
[55:48] I'm not going to do it.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Some of you think by looking down you
[55:52] forget about it. No, I won't forget
[55:53] about it. Hallelujah. So, everyone's
[55:56] [applause] got homework.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [laughter]
[56:00] Amen. My heavenly home is bright and
[56:04] [singing] fair. [music]
