greet you all in the precious name the matchless name yes amen the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's the name above every other name amen hallelujah maybe we think something about the Gen name or the Mami name or the p name or something but there's no name that can compare with that name yes Lord and Jesus said you take that name with you and you cast out demons in that name amen you speak in my name you ask in my name amen hallelujah so we are just thankful that we can obey the word of God and we understand the Revelation behind that amen it is just not Hing that name but there's got to be a life behind that name that makes the demons tremble amen hallelujah amen amen so once again we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ suddenly a privilege to be gathered together in the house of the Lord amen I have a confession to make that I love the Lord Jesus Christ amen and I love his people amen hallelujah how many of you feel that way amen just become so drunk in the spirit you know they even try to boil but you can't boil the bride in oil because she thrives by oil amen they tried to boil John in oil but oil didn't work amen amen so this bride is just like John and when he went back in and he wrote those three last Epistles you can see he was the Apostle of love amen John being the type of the Bride that received all the Revelation became the Apostle of love the bride that's growing up now in seven in the Statue of a perfect man the Capstone of love coming down she becomes the bride the wife of love amen hallelujah a cap is love she can't help but express love amen hallelujah when the dead in Christ rise they shall the void themselves that's our hope that's our faith nobody can feel the void of Pastor Ronnie going away but who F that void when the scripture comes to pass because he hasn't gone away we're not done away with him he's just in another place but he will come and take his place and I was sharing with them that not one of them that die in Christ shall miss the Rapture because the Bible says the dead in Christ shall First Rise then we which shall alive and remain our body shall be changed and we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye so the saints that are going on shall not miss the Rapture in fact all seven Church ages shall not miss the Rapture they are going to be there but that's the value of the message that we know these things amen hallelujah so this morning amen we want to turn to the word of God if we can stand for the word of God Amen also continue to pray for brother Moses amen our dear brother amen the Lord will touch him he's in a hospital admitted in hospital at the moment but we pray amen that God maybe can even use a sence to diagnose a case and tell us what's wrong so we know what areas to Target amen hallelujah because I'm not one who doesn't believe the Prophet The Prophet says God works through medicine God heals through medicine God heals through music God heals through his word amen amen God heals through his preaching so there's many ways that God heals and however his Sovereign hand chooses to work amen we are willing to obey that so this morning I want to speak on the syllabus for adoption and Redemption am amen the syllabus for adoption and Redemption and if you're asking what is that syllabus Galatians 4 says we are placed under tutors yes so a tutor must have a syllabus oh yes Hallelujah you know we jumped ahead of the story and we said the sun will go under tutorship but tonight today we want to focus on what the syllabus is yesen amen praise the Lord so the syllabus for adoption and Redemption is c o d hallelujah hallelujah so things may get hot and heavy but we in battle yes Hallelujah let's turn to 1 Timothy CH 3 and ver1 15 praise the Lord remember we wrestle not against flesh and blood yes but against principalities and Powers rulers of Darkness spiritual wickedness in our places so 1 Timothy 3 15 but if I T long thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God Amen which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth where is who is the pillar of and ground of Truth the Church of the Living God so truth must be coming out of us yes amen so he's saying we ought to know how to behave ourselves in the house of God for 2 Timothy 3 and: 16 you can open your bibl amen hallelujah open your Bibles is like music sheets amen and if you don't know that's one of the uh parts of conduct order and Doctrine is for you to carry your Bible to church and when the word of God is read you read it from your Bible amen so 2 Timothy 3 and: 16 says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for do so we we we read the first one is behavior which was your conduct second now it's profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect amen thly furnished unto all good works am so the word of God is going to thoroughly furnish you maybe in your house you don't have the money to furnish your house but the spiritual House of God God is going to thoroughly furnish your house thank you Lord you are not going to have a lounge with no furniture amen you know you are three part your body spirit and soul God is going to fill all of that so 1 Timothy 5:1 17 read let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially they will labor in word and Doctrine amen one more scripture St John 1 and verse 12 praise the Lord amen but as many as received him have we received him to them gave you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name amen so he has given us power to become the sons of God you may be seated the Lord at blessings to the reading of his word amen so while you seated I want to read Ephesians chapter 4 amen so we are all striving for Perfection yes amen amen we are all striving to reach that final Perfection where we shall take a changing of the body but we are growing up Amen in the things of Christ amen hallelujah amen and he gave here is God's now God's way of perfecting the church so if I can say it another way the church will not come to Perfection unless this scripture IS F fulfilled now watch it's a very important part of the word because we are talking about conduct order and Doctrine and in God's order he won't work disorderly amen he'll work via his own order so this is the order he gave for the church to be edified now he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now why would he give that here's the answer for the perfecting of the Saints amen amen so you can't say that you can do away with a fivefold Ministry and reach Perfection God won't violate his own word yes amen hallelujah for the work of the ministry amen they must be involved in Ministry you know the prophet defined each office gift there yes amen you can go and read it each offers gift their role what they're supposed to do he defined it for the edifying of the Body of Christ now this is where I feel greater effort needs to be put in in the next verse till we all come in the unity of the faith amen not divide the body of Christ not bring a Doctrine in that will divide the body of Christ amen I'm a firm believer and I don't believe in the analogy of this one thing that we are looking at an elephant and somebody's looking at the leg and somebody's looking at the tail and but we all are looking at the same thing but yet with the same mouth we are saying we have the opening of the word the full word reveal so we had one Prophet one Prophet messenger how come we have different interpretations of that one message yeah now how many of you will agree with me that the full word was revealed to us in this hour amen so God doesn't want you to look at an elephant leg or look at the elephant tail or look at the elephant here he wants you to be in an eagle anointing where you have a full view of the word you must see the full elephant for those of you like the elephant analogy and the pyramid when you look at it from the top you can see all sides of the pyramid yes hallelujah amen so I'm not of that theory brother you know okay you see that way and I see it this way I want to see it God's way I want to see it through the eyes of the Prophet one of us is lying yes Hallelujah of us is dis sorting truth amen now come on we got to call a spade a spade we are in the kingdom of God and we are fighting demon Spirits amen hallelujah amen so we can't be having one message and different interpretations of that message right so now we must come in unity of the faith so any ministry that's dividing is not working with the five-fold ministry and the knowledge of the Son of God and watch going to bring us unto a perfect man amen unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we end forth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and canning craftiness whereby they lay in weight to deceive wow amen but speaking the truth in love may grow up oh I love to grow up amen hallelujah May grow up into to him in all things which is the head even Christ amen hallelujah praise the Lord so in Galatians chapter 4 like we were saying you're placed under a tutor now the prophet of God teaches us that you don't become a son when you are born again you always were a son and only a son with the seed Gene with him can be reborn Hallelujah so not everyone can come to this message of the hour this message is for sons of God Amen those that were locked up in the back part of God's mind from before the foundation of the world those who placed a seed Gene within your soul all of you are gathered here today because God called you to the message of the hour there's a seed Gene within you and God has predestinated that se Gene amen so if you are sitting here today don't be discouraged you can only respond to the word and the word is not Grievous to you because there's a SE within your soul now Satan will come and play mind battles but you've got to take the word to the mind to the Battleground amen you've got to defeat Satan by the word and say Satan it is written he gave me power to become a Son of God hallelujah amen so all through our natural life you know that we were following somebody we were led by somebody somebody led us through our childhood somebody led us through our teenage years through our adult life amen these were stages in our growth and your teacher your parents that you were under amen taught you according to the your growth they didn't teach you algebra when you were a little baby but according to the stages of your growth they taught you things amen and as you were growing the teaching increased the instruction got greater and your understanding grew amen now the teacher won't give you more than you can grasp in natural and in the spiritual amen I want you to know that father knows you by name yes Father Knows you individually amen father knows which area of development you need in your life hallelujah amen and if the teacher can see you cannot grasp certain Concepts he slows down the teaching until you understand now what we were saying is I want you to understand something and this blessed my heart when I when I was was reading it when Jesus was baptized at the Jordan River we know that was the Holy Spirit coming into him now we know there's two works the Holy Spirit does two Works he's coming for a birth and for an adoption amen so Matthew chapter 3 he's there at the Jordan River and the Holy Spirit descends like a dove yes okay so catch this now there's a specific work now that he's going to do in his three and a half years of ministry yes okay he's the God man yes he's basically Adam reproduced yes but he's not born of a woman he comes to show us the kind of man Adam was what we fell from yes amen so listen to this now Jesus goes in Matthew chapter 17 up on a mountain for what brother brandham calls his adoption ceremony hallelujah amen amen now watch the timing of it is what I'm trying to tell you because as was he so is she the process that he goes through she will go through but I ask you was it before his body change Hallelujah it was before Jesus died buried and rose again that he was taken on a great adoption ceremony and he'll set you before Angels come on don't look for things in the future God is doing now God is going to do it now amen his adoption ceremony was before he entered Hallelujah so you and I are coming now in our great adoption ceremony Hallelujah specific time and season now remember the church has progressed we've had the prophetic word hallelujah we we've had the prophetic anointing we've had the prophetic gift come to take the word and open it up unto us but there's been a progression we've been under the tutor we've been under the guide amen hallelujah all of these things we've been hearing through the years amen have been building Upon Our Most Holy Faith Hallelujah now now is not the time to have a crisis of Faith now is not the time to backslide now is not the time to go and do the things of the world because you're thinking since Brandon fell asleep all things continue as they amen nothing is progressing don't let Satan deceive you in this hour and you know what you lay with a dog will get its fleas watch the company you keeping Hallelujah either they are going to influence you or you are going to influence them amen hallelujah amen now anybody that rejects the message of the hour that's equal to blasphemy because his message is the Holy Ghost yes Hallelujah this message is the message of redemption even the Bible says when you're going into a place and they don't receive your word that's your feet Hallelujah he says judgment is coming upon that town so I'm telling you what the company you keep watch the people you love and don't go and marry an unbeliever because you want Satan to be your father-in-law she is going to make her life like what she's used to H so you young men That's not married yet don't ever the prophet says don't ever marry an unbeliever hello all you see married people here you all talk to one another don't ever look don't ever marry an unbeliever hallelujah amen and from our experiences these ones that grow up in denominations are even worse because they are religious and they will tell you they'll give you to understand they are Christians now you're going to go there and tell them ah but why are you wearing pants they've been wearing pants since they were born yeah unless they a c Gene of God that God delivers them from there and brings them out of there amen but you don't go and test it don't go say I'm bringing them in they're going to take you out the deadly snipers here they'll take you out amen praise the [Music] Lord so what's The Company You Keep amen so God is going to put us through trials and testing right not Temptations the trial and the test is to prove you that you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God Amen anyone that is studying goes through a testing time you study for 3 years you go and you put through a test that test is not the university wanting to fail you they want to see if you have become what you have learned yes amen that you being a Son of God can handle the test with patience with Temperance you can handle it with faith you can handle it with knowledge and you you know it's intended design is for you to pass and move on to the next dimension of the Holy Ghost so you have to be put through a test and exam to prove to the tutor that you understood the teaching so he says count it all joy when fiery Trials come upon you amen amen amen when you put through a test count it all joy because the one amen that put you put you through the test he says he's more than able to deliver you amen amen that's the word of God so they want to see if the knowledge locked up inside of you when you write the exams and pass amen is to prove that you are now become what you have studied the books and knowledge contained in the book is now on two feet so we can't have people sitting for 20 years studying the syllabus and failing the syllabus you see the Dynamics have to come upon something amen the Dynamics don't come upon nothing the Dy the the Dynamics come upon the mechanics which is the word of God that is sown in our hearts can somebody say Amen the Holy Ghost is not coming there on empty where there's no word the Holy Ghost feeds on the word the prophet says he feeds on the word Hallelujah now when the Holy Ghost you can't come into the service raise your hand and say welcome Holy Spirit welcome welcome Holy Spirit he's coming to feed and now he comes to your house and he sees your cupboard empty there's no word amen amen born again on a Sunday gone again on a Monday born again on a Wednesday gone again on a Thursday Hallelujah now remember it's very important to follow the instruction from the spirit of Truth amen because Saul lost the kingdom he lost his anointing because of Disobedience and the scripture says it is better to obey obedience is better than sacrifice so you don't want to lose your blessing in the Kingdom because you are affected by the veil that it is coming out of the prophet of God said if you can't if you don't even if you don't love your pastor he said you respect his office yes you respect that office amen because that is God's Veil praise the Lord so in the kingdom of God we've been placed under a tutor a guide the spirit of Truth and he has a syllabus which is the word of God amen amen now God has only one way to reveal the syllabus and the Hidden Mysteries and that is through his Prophet surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His sec secret to his servant the prophets am amen and he interprets the word we know how he interprets the word by letting it come to pass amen hallelujah so when a son is born into a home now we are not used to this we are not used to this Eastern tradition that when a son is born into a home he's placed under tutors right but in the Eastern tradition that the Bible is talking about here he is placed under tutors the father's business must continue and he the prophet of God dramatizes it and he says he don't have time to teach the son he's got to attend to his business so while the son is growing up he's putting you under tutors amen okay so we have been placed now in not in a home but in a kingdom when we are born again we are born into the kingdom and we are placed under tutorship of the Holy Spirit some of you say you're speaking very simple very plain I like to speak simple and plain that a child can understand me amen when you are put into the kingdom of God you placed under the tutorship of the holy spirit amen so we have we are now on a spiritual journey a growth now like we saying we cannot be backsliding now with the things of the world in the time of the Rapture the cycle of the Rapture has already begun which is the shout which started amen now the voice of the Archangel amen is fixing to change to the voice of the resurrection and call the sleeping Saints amen yes amen now we know that the Bible truths were lost through seven Church ages the full word the full strength of the word through deception amen the writer went out riding and the truth were taken out from the people and they began to take Creeds and dogmas and man's ideas about the word and what the word says just to give you an example the true baptism of baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was taken away and replaced with the titles Father Son and Holy Ghost but in the Bible you'll find that all the disciples baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can you say amen amen now what is that Doctrine amen praise the Lord so we find the church went into apostasy which means that they abandoned the word of God for Creeds dogmas and men's ideas but Jesus said that man must live by bread and by the word of God some of you are shocked Jesus said don't live by bread alone which means you can live by bread man must live by bread and the word of God every word that proceeds from the mouth of God praise the Lord so it is through the tutor that the sun will be positioned when the training is coming to an end it is through the tutor the report that the tutor is going to give that the son will be positioned amen depending on how well he is following the tutor's instruction learning and how well he is growing now the basis of the syllabus we know we have ABCs we start our syllabus with ABCs always believe Christ amen amen any man who come to God must first believe that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him without faith it's impossible to please God so we we must believe Christ yes amen so why is conduct order and Doctrine such a big part of the message why does brother brandham labor extensively on this aspect in his sermons while he's preaching Doctrine he'll go into conduct you'll go into order because it is the tutor presenting the syllabus amen amen why why did the the Ministries even our amen our ministers that have gone on why did the labor in conduct order and Doctrine it's to position the church amen to stabilize the church yes amen praise the Lord and I am saying we must never ever forget the conduct the order and the doctrine amen amen amen praise the Lord people think that certain parts of the message we can do away with no we've got to eat the whole book amen we've got to eat the entire word some parts may be bitter but eat it amen follow the instruction so why do the pastors labor with this amen we know it's a syllabus if you fail you will not be position for adoption now remember brother Bram says a son who fails the test remains a son meaning that he's in the Kingdom he hasn't lost his salvation he says but he is without Authority in the Kingdom he's living beneath these privileges amen I don't want to be like that I want to live in the full blessing of the Holy Ghost I want to be like Joshua and Caleb when they walked in the land amen they said this is our inheritance we are more than able the others just want you to remain Sons amen praise the Lord amen so if you fail the syllabus you will not be positioned for adoption the tutor is going to give an honest report you can't go bribe the Holy Ghost now amen the Holy Ghost is a spirit of Truth he can't help but speak the truth amen he's going to give a report to the father how was your conduct how was your order and how was your Doctrine oh yes this is the teaching of the father's Kingdom and how it operates when we say the tutor has to give a good honest report the holy spirit is a spirit of Truth and we know he's going to give a report based on conduct order and Doctrine now conduct is the manner in which a person behaves right a man in which the person behaves is he rebellious does he click his tongue attitude is also very important to conduct what's the attitude towards coming to church Hallelujah all right that's why I was speaking to the church last week what is our attitude when we are coming to church you remember I said why it's so important this is forming part of the report of the tutor hallelujah amen can you follow Church order and Doctrine can you follow what he says about those things going to reminds you some of those things the prophet says a Christian can't wait for the church doors to be open the preparation starts even the night before the week before because they are praying for the service they are praying Lord speak to me speak to me amen speak to me now some of you may be thinking why are you going to this I want you to be position for power amen but you can't bypass this and expect the power of God you can't expect to come into full Authority full sense of authority be able to speak things if you neglect these things this is in fact the discipline that when you don't want to read your Bible you disciplined enough to read it yes amen you know you you know you find time to read the Bible you make time you know you find time to pray you make time yes you know you you hear many people they say I haven't seen you in so many years and you tell them I'm so busy I don't got time but you know if something is important to you you will make the time if this means all the world to you you will make the time you will sacrifice sleep you will sacrifice late hours of the night early parts of the morning and you will make time for the word of God I tell you not you can never lose if you invest your time in the things of God and the word of God you'll be the biggest winner you'll be the most blessed person hallelujah amen you'll be the most rich person rich in love rich in faith rich in kindness rich in good things amen people will love to be around you because you're so full of the word of godall Amen praise the Lord so you may be thinking why you preaching this thing now I don't want Church order conduct or doctrine I'm trying to position the church and show you the importance of conduct order and Doctrine because it's a syllabus for adoption amen praise the Lord so now if I take that word and I say conduct there's another meaning for it the manner in which an organization is managed now I'm going to change the word this is a literal meaning I'm going to say the manner in which the kingdom of God is is managed amen hallelujah yes Lord how many if you know that the kingdom of God cannot operate without you and I if every single man and woman on the earth rejected the gospel the kingdom of God cannot operate right now because Jesus said the kingdom of God is within man amen he's within you the Holy Spirit was not sent to flow to run as a ghost upon the Earth but it was sent to Tabernacle men amen the prophet says we can make the Holy Ghost powerless when we don't allow him to come and have the full Authority in our lives that is why demon powers want to attach themselves to your body and possess you because they also realize they need a body you see there are some things which are spiritual which maybe were not taught or are not taught to the church that that there's a spiritual Kingdom and a spiritual side that operating yes all we see is the five senses and what we can connect with these five senses but right now going through this room amen these pictures voices not only that right now they are angels of God right here right now they are spirits of the enemy right here amen hallelujah so the manner in which you conduct yourself in the kingdom of God is important amen maybe you don't you don't uh you don't want to hear certain things but because you have respect for the kingdom of God you say yes Lord I believe that even when you don't understand it you say yes Lord I believe it amen that's how you're engaging spiritual warfare now because in the kingdom of God this is the spiritual warfare how it's being managed now let's go to our first quot there and show you I want to show you the conduct part quickly he says if I told you the spirit of Christ was in me I must act like Jesus talking about your conduct you must act like Jesus your character and conduct must be molded like that and the Holy Spirit molds that conduct when he comes into you when you're really born again of the spirit of God how many of you want to be more like Jesus more and more and more and more of Jesus Amen less and less of me so what is it how we act conduct how we behave and the Holy Spirit is working on our character amen how's our attendance how's our you know that's part of conduct am you go to school they have a code of conduct what time does a school start you come late they put your name there the monitor loves to take your name down and then they put you in something called detention so we're going to start detention how many feel you like detention amen praise the Lord part of conduct hair covering how are you some of you looking so sad you know you go to school they dictate how you come your hair what you can have and what you can't have you'll allow them to tell you what to do but the house of God must not tell you what to do amen you go into a uh some banks in some places they tell you no helmets allowed they tell you no phones allowed switch your phones off there yes sir yes so three bags full you can copy everything you come in the house you go you know people's attitude they can follow the law of the land curfew by 8 all running service at 7even nobody wants to come what is the matter we place more value in the Kingdom of man than the the kingdom of God I tell you seated here is the king is the Sons and Daughters of God who have the authority and the power to operate the kingdom of God in your life but it's our attitude towards things and how we are taking the things of God that are making us live beneath our privileges that's what the prophet of God says our attitude to things our attitude to come into church on time our attitude that's what I was telling you last week how is your dress code amen when you first started hey the dress is down there by the toe can't even see your toes then it get shorter and shorter and shorter hey then we got a special wardrobe for church and we got a special wardrobe for the other days of the week you sounding like Pastor running hey amen I need to put back here bring the Evangelist out I'm just trying to show you the conduct we ought not to be failing in these things if you want to be adopted amen I'm showing you in the little things that matter I added you to these things amen so don't let your short your dresses get shorter and shorter you know what the prophet say amen or do you need to be reminded of these things hallelujah how is sister should dress you know when you get to heaven you can't go and alter your dress the prophet says when you went in the sixth Dimension they were wearing garments that were flowing in the wind now the Garment is so tight no wind can move that garment let me tell you something sisters we are not interested in your body shape we don't want to see your body shape keep that for your husband amen we like to see women fully clothed and not only the women are wearing tight clothing men wearing tight clothing so tight you know why gays are designing these clothes so now if gays want to admire other men they make clothing that fits so tight for other men so they get an opportunity to look at these men and Christian men are Fallen prey to this you seen the cified people walk on the streets with shorts pink shorts they're wearing now they don't know gay designers now those gay designers are sitting and looking at all these men there they don't realize there's a spirit attached to it yes amen amen hallelujah what are we what are we doing building a strong church amen equipping it for the kingdom of God amen dress code and hair amen men ought not to be womanizers amen how you conduct yourself with other sisters how you conduct yourself with single women how you conduct yourself remember you are representing father's Kingdom and you're also representing the church wherever you go am amen you know brother Brandon put out a notice one time the only person that brandom Tabernacle sends out is his Pastor because people were going out to preach in the name of of the Tabernacle so he sent out a notice so I'm saying watch your conduct amen watch your order praise the Lord so order of the church now very quickly let's go into order you can go and read the prophet what he says about your dress code about amen all of these things in under conduct so when we come to order of the church in the Kingdom how it functions it functions on spiritual laws God's kingdom is not run up as it amen we don't run our business app as it neither should his kingdom be run up as it God has set order in his church God has set Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors that's God's order in the church God's dress wear that's his Veil and that Veil ought to be respected let's go to the next p brother amen listen to what he's saying God fortified his army with what himself in the form of prophets Hallelujah Apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was God doing listen did you ever think what that officers of the church is it's God's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a Seer fore before Satan ever gets to it done told it what is it God dressed up in his church amen these officers is God's dress wear when you see those officers pastors teachers evangelists what is it that's God's dress wear God's presence God's spirit working through man and everybody said amen and if that office denies any of this word then it's not God's dressing right working through man and if that office denies okay I'm reading that that's wolf in sheep's clothing now I don't want you you know sheep can also deceive themselves do you know how sheep deceive themselves they pull the wool over their eyes don't deceive yourself you see when it comes to these things and having respects for God's offices we ought to keep that thing it seems that this is lacking in the ranks of the messy church amen but you've got to be able to keep this now he says and if that office denies any of his word then it's not God's dressing that's wolf and sheep's clothing watch that fellow beware of him but when he just takes the word and says remember that's God cuz he's speaking in his word you see and if he says oh oh oh oh my get going sheep get going so if the pastor says get going sheep you ought to get going that's what he's telling you so the doctrine of the church we know Doctrine positionally places the believer positionally amen yeah he says in the spoken word is the Original Seed when the anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible plant from the serpent to the messenger in the former Reign so he's going to plant the entire seed who the anointed messenger what am i showing you he's going to sww the entire doctrine of the Bible from serpent seed which is from Genesis all the way to Revelation amen the prophet of the age gave us the doctrine L we forget the doctrine of serpent seed the doctrine of baptism in Jesus name the God had revealed Christ The Mystery of God revealed the truth about marriage and divorce who is is mesic amen invisible Union future home what is this doctrines in the Bible amen revelations in the Bible contained in the word hallelujah amen praise the Lord now who is the one that is receiving this word it his only sons who have a gene everybody else hates this message of the hour everybody else can't stand the message of the hour few weeks ago last month when we were doing that Outreach work yeah this man walks past he looks at the speaker and he goes he says that's William brandham so they even know the name I said yes that's William brandham and then he said okay and he walked away so they are not ignorant they even know he's voice imagine that this voice is thundering in the plaza and this man turns and he says he recognizes the voice but I tell you him recognizing it and you recognizing it are two different things when he can recognize it to being William branam you recognize it to being Malachi 4:5 and 6 you recognize it to be Revelation 10:7 you put a scriptural identification to that voice amen praise the Lord so it's only sons of God that can accept this voice Sons because you remember that chicken story in that eagle in the B you're an eagle you're an eagle from birth you wasn't a chicken running there that became an eagle that wasn't a power of transformation there you wasn't a chicken that became an eagle you were always an eagle to begin with you were just in the wrong place yeah your rebirth put a DE to the old nature to bring quickening power upon the SE of God within you then you can truly say If any man be in Christ he is a new creature all things have passed away behold all things have become new now what is this the message of the hour is the land of adoption you can't be adopted any other place you can't be adopted in Pentecost neither can you be adopted in any other denominational Church the message of the hour is the land of adoption amen amen this is where you get your conduct this is where you get your order this is where you get your Doctrine the syllabus for adoption the prophet says you'll never get it until you hide away with God into that land of adoption we've been through this before what is the land of adoption it is right in the shako glory it's not out there in the first Court neither is it out there in the second court amen the second Court requires amen through work those candlesticks require work they carbonized they still need to be cleaned and relit again in fact those seven candlesticks are in that second court with the seven Messengers but when you get behind the holiest of holies amen there's no candlesticks there there's only the Shak glory of God there's only a priest who is commissioned amen for that job there's only a priest who lives his life in service for the king Hallelujah he shut in from the rest of the world a hidden life with God nobody sees his secret life it's him and God alone praise the Lord that is the land of adoption praise the Lord so the prophet is saying you got to get into the land of adoption God is designed that if any man who will be adopted must first be found in the land where adoption is possible you know who you are you know you're a Son of God you know your identity you know amen who we are first and you know in whose family we belong now you can never enjoy your inheritance amen if you are not connected with the word yes if you are not connected now in this hour with the word you are not going to live in the land of your inheritance amen you're going to be living in the glare of another age a glare of another time or somebody's going to position and say look what we are going to be looking into the future but failing to see what you are now amen yes I say like the Bible now are we the sons of God now are we positioned amen yes Lord a son born into a family is no better than a servant unless he's adopted that is why the boy there laying the pig pen he knew he wasn't a doctor he said even the servants in My Father's House are eating better than me I want to go and I'd rather be a servant he knew he was co- equal with the servants in terms of inheritance he was no better than a servant Hallelujah so before we can come into our inheritance and enjoy our inheritance we must undergo undergo a process of growth amen a level of conduct a level of maturity God's not going to place power into hands of people who can't operate this power you must manage finances you must manage his time you must manage things of how is he ever going to have confidence in you the the preparation takes place in the land of adoption I know I know we're not getting many amens today amen if I say Amen speak your car speak your house speak this everyone's jumping and shouting but what I am doing is doing the hard work of teaching you how to become into your position am so maybe you don't want to say Amen now you're missing out on a blessing yes this is the hard part where you need to say Amen even when it goes against the flesh yes amen amen this is the part where you ought to be rejoicing because I I'm going to say this again you did not stray into the [Music] message you're not a stray cat in the message you're a thoroughbred pedigree of God yes the aine of God God in fact designed you for being the message of the hour God called you to the message of the hour this is what you are called for your greatest achievement in life is to be a son and daughter of God amen positionally placed amen hallelujah the message of the hour places us on the grounds of adoption amen the prophet told us amen the prophet is told go back to East and reveal the Seven Seals what is that those Revelations that are contained in the Seven Seals amen who brought down the syllabus yes Lord the syllabus for adoption amen the final syllabus the final word of God Amen when nothing else else could satisfy us yeah amen amen God sent a word not of the earth not touched by man's Creeds by man's ideas amen God sent a word praise the Lord the prophet is told go back and open those seals because those Revelations that are contained in there are necessary to build a man into the full stature Amen to build a man and make him in the likeness of God Amen the adoption material was sent down to the Earth thank you Lord yes amen all those seals must be loosed the prophet of God here in the next message brother amen as I was with Moses see what he says we are looking for the Joshua of this day which is the Holy Spirit to lead us into the land Hallelujah but watch the next verse now if you're looking for him he has to speak through somebody yes hallelujah praise the Lord ah he has to speak to somebody because he's a and a spirit requires a body to speak through I've told you what he's told me now you believe it and be healed amen amen you know if a childlike Faith receives that nothing shall be able to stand before you you have such confidence in the one who spoke you know we Marvel Jesus even marveled at the centurion's faith but if you think about it this man had faith in Jesus Christ but he himself didn't possess the power to speak Hallelujah so I'm saying you are greater than the Centurion you're a Son of God Amen he required Jesus to speak Jesus Is Telling You Greater Works than these shall he do for I go unto my father well nobody believes that amen praise the Lord there's no record of the woman who was caught in the act of adultery that she became a Believer there's no record of it there's no record of people who came and asked to be healed that they became Believers so I'm saying you are called for a higher purpose you are called for higher authority oh yes Lord so watch people are people are taking this p misquoting it when the prophet is saying we are looking for the Joshua of this day which is the Holy Spirit to lead us into the land he has to speak through somebody because he's a spirit he is meaning himself this is not meaning Joseph brandom hello yes don't misinterpret the word just like how he spoke in quoted forms about him being Elijah the prophet and how he spoke in quoted forms about him being revelation 10:7 he's speaking here and saying the spirit of Truth is coming in me amen and he will lead you and guide you into all truth amen it's okay to listen to Joseph Branham because Joseph brandham don't have a message of his own he's telling you to listen to this voice you see so he got no message of his own he's got no prophecy of his own he's only telling you to listen to this voice but this is amen the prophet of the age yes Hallelujah so if he is our tutor under the Holy Ghost we must know the curriculum we must understand the syllabus and the syllabus must be perfected in us we can't just be going around quoting stuff the syllabus becomes perfected in us I am the word made flesh today and now check yourself in the mirror of the word and be sure that your work is [Music] true amen check yourself in the mirror of God's word seven angels came down to give him the perfect syllabus for adoption yes but now if it's a syllabus for adoption some people are not studying the syllabus yes so what's going to have exam time come now Jesus only took 3 and a half years from the Jordan to the Cross yes some of our seven years 10 years 15 years don't know the syllabus us amen praise the Lord so he sent the Seven Seals not just one thing he sent the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation he sent the revelation of it that is why amen the prophet said after the preaching of the seal my Bible became a new book Hallelujah he sent the perfect interpretation amen a Capstone Revelation came to the church to give us a perfect understanding amen praise the Lord amen so the ability to speak to a mountain came with a condition yes you must be positioned before he can give you the authority praise the Lord and this is where people are going to fail because remember what brother Bram says if they fail they remain a son we don't want to just remain a son we want to become a redeemed son and daughter of God so power we were saying power without character power with character is foot to rule power without character Satan will use you amen so you must come into the land of adoption the land where the perfect curriculum the perfect syllabus is given you don't just have one word amen you don't have the word alone now that's where some people are also failing they've only got the word no Spirit we want both word and spirit we want both Dynamics and mechanics amen and this syllabus I want you to know there is no other Edition there is no this 2015 Edition and now 20 24 Edition the word is the same yesterday today and forever it'll defeat Satan on any ground any time and any place amen the word of God will never grow old amen the word of God is eternal life praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord now compromising never ever amen compromising has never ever worked we can't be compromises in the message hallelujah amen men in the house I'm going to speak to you men who are the head of your family you are the priest of your home God is going to hold you accountable as to how you run your home so which means you are respons responsible for the way your wife dresses you are responsible for the way your children dress you are responsible for bringing them to church come on somebody say Amen you're the priest of the home so if anybody's going to be accountable you are going to be accountable the prophet God says we got too many sissified men allow the woman to run around with shorts and wear all kinds of clothing sissies God called us into the greatest message it can't be now that we are so modern that we' forgotten the principles of the message amen hallelujah I tell you again you want to spend time with unbelievers we going to burn in hell you don't want to spend time with the people of God Amen and you know who's going to be have the biggest shame you're going to hide your head you're going to want to go under the ground yourself that day the Judgment they're going to look at you we bride together now my chops are being bried hey you never told me you be an influence to the unbeliever yes amen don't let them influence you yes amen amen men ought to be preached in the home leading the home teaching the home amen praise the Lord because the Bible says the woman is a weaker vessel they'll do whatever you allow them to do can I get the sisters to say amen I was expecting you don't say amen I was expecting you to say no brother even if he allows me to do that I'm going to stay with the word but I appreciate your honesty because that's what women are right I guarantee you now very few women if the husband leave the message now and say that message is false they'll stay they're going to say where he leads me I will follow amen let's bring this to a close now amen so what was this the attack on the cloud that you seen recently was the attack on the message of adoption you know why Satan don't want you to be adopted Satan's kingdom is finished when you are adopted Satan hates this message that's why the attack on the cloud he doesn't want you to believe this is the message of adoption that came down L Hallelujah but there's a people who took the word amen who said hey this is not a rain cloud this is formed by seven angels you can say what you want Hallelujah these same unbelievers would have been there back in the day of Moses there when the pull of fire was over them over the Red Sea they had a pull of cloud and they had a pull of fire hanging over them they would have said uh we can't find the newspaper articles to record this the Press didn't take the picture bunch of unbelievers same Spirits you know Spirits didn't die JIS and jamus didn't the spirit that was in them didn't die the spirit that was in dayon and Kora didn't die Spirits don't die these Spirits are here within the framework of the message of the hour and we've got to stand strong for the truth can I get some Believers amen who will stay with God's word we will not compromise but say I'm staying with God's conduct I'm staying with God's order I'm staying with God's Doctrine others may not believe it but I believe it this is my syllabus this is what I'm going to be judg on amall amen hallelujah amen you may not know amen Jesus by a picture maybe the closest picture is open's head amen but I know him amen I know his life I know his nature I know his character I can see him in the word amen I can see how you watch in the word amen he's watching my action he's watching my attitude to the word in every manner I must reflect in the word yes Lord amen amen so amen amen hallelujah so even a Goldsmith you know he takes a gold and he beats and he beats and he beats and he beats he's taking all the drust out until he can see his reflection now he's looking at you and he says brother raes I see my reflection in you I see my reflection in you I see my reflection in you when he starts to see his reflection in you you know sometimes the boy don't even look like the father but maybe he looks like the mother a bit amen but what he's watching for he's watching for the character he's watching for his nature amen amen yeah praise the Lord amen hallelujah the land of adoption is in the holiest of holiest amen so we've got to watch amen hallelujah we're told in the spirit to watch and pray amen hallelujah here we are in the land of adoption we're enjoying the fullness of our blessing amen because there is blessing in the adoption amen amen there's Authority in the adoption praise the Lord yes we are here in the fullness now just before the body change now is not the time I say again to have a crisis of Faith now is a time of repentance amen if you've been wavering and wandering around thinking hey these young ministers They Don't Preach conduct they so modern hello amen I want you to know we don't believe in a diluted message of the hour we believe in the same message the prophet preached in the same way he preached it amen hallelujah amen how can we Testify the life that I live is no longer the life I live now when we're still doing the things of the world how can we say that God took us away from our abots when we still doing some of us in fact grew up very strict in the message and as we got older we started to let down the bars we let down the bars we let down the bars the goats got in you wonder how the Sheep got out hey what is that analogy the frog in the water you put it not water it jumps out but Satan puts you there and he turned up the temperature gradually but the spirit of Truth is here this morning amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah so you see at the end of it now what was the report that the tutor gave the father it was now the prophet says it was how he conducts himself how he follows the orders and the teaching you see why c d brother the brandom details that he says he gives a report whether he's able to handle the father's business I want you to know the father's business is the kingdom of Goden yes thank you if God taught us his conduct if God taught us his order if God taught us his doctrine that is the entire syllabus of the message amen praise the Lord let's just bring it to a close now and we'll read here amen let's go to adoption part three paragraph 74 now God took you into the body of Christ now what does he do after you proved yourself Sanctified yourself with good behavior conduct obedience to the spirit no matter what the world says he says I'm going to rub this wheale hard I didn't mean to be rude please don't see I don't want to be what wearies me is to take people and preach to them this godsend truth and they'll turn right back around and just keep on doing the same thing and say they got the Holy Ghost right we know that's deception now that's the gates of hell that just nearly ruins you see what's the matter they come right back to the same thing just like the children of Israel they wanted a king So this King could rule over them and make them act like the amorites and the amalekites and the Phil times don't do you know ladies you see he go straight into the conduct now the order do you know ladies that it's wrong to wear slacks do you know that do you know it's wrong to cut locks off your hair do you know it's wrong mister for you to continue to smoke and act the way you do do you know it's wrong for you not for you not to be the husband of your house your wife got get a little temper spell and kick you out the door and say yes bless your heart hone I'll come right back do you know how can you be a tender at the house of God when you can't control your own house amen that's exactly right do you know sister that your husband is not only your husband but he's your ruler God said so because that the husband was not deceived the woman was deceived and your preachers will continue to make women pastors and preachers in your churches knowing that the word of God condemns you you'll continually use that name father Son and Holy Ghost to baptize when there's not one spec of scripture for it in the Bible I want an bishop or somebody else to show me where anybody in the Bible was ever baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost I want somebody to show me anywhere beside the name of the Jesus right Hallelujah so how close are we keeping the word have we looked into our conduct have we looked into our order have we looked into our Doctrine because remember our life must match the word last final quotes now see and then the father after he had given the tutors the rights to raise his son the tutor had to bring word to the father how the son was progressing right now he was heir of all things but yet he didn't come into legal possession until there was a ceremony and he had fully done that which was right and was worthy now many people is in the Earth today and I say this with all respect many setting right here who absolutely living under your privilege as Sons and Daughters of God I won't say you'll be lost because when God Saves and then he never loses them is what he's trying to say right I'm not trying to preach Doctrine I'm only saying if God now if you not mentally walked up but if God Saves you knowing he's going to lose you defeats his purpose he doesn't do that when he saved you you're saved he that heareth my words believeth on him that sent me at everlasting life right so he says you're still a son and daughter but you're living under your privilege and your conduct each day as the Holy Spirit brings it before the father gives away the things that you do amen so how is he giving a report daily yes amen and you're still a son and daughter but you'll never be brought to the place where you should be now that's a dangerous part right we don't want to be like that great gifts that are in the church are so misused yes and can I say are also unused great gifts that are in the church can be unused no reverence to it just a bunch of carryon until it brings a disgrace to the public how that the Holy Spirit would like to govern that bring it down the tutor brought the message to the father and said the child is progressing right or wrong then if it came no matter what the outside people had to say about this child what the servants and the farm man had to say he tried to work work every way to please the father and no matter what the world has to say about you work to please God Amen do everything you can to build the kingdom of God Amen don't never separate it build it together amen hallelujah amen final quote now in hear he him then when the sun had become to the place of accountability say 21 we call it today then if the tutor brought word to the father and told him everything was fine this boy was a gallant man that he was zealous of the father's Kingdom and he done all he could to improve and EMB better the kingdom then this boy what we call the placing of a child the father take him to a public place set him before the public his same son that was born into the home years ago all the time his son this is what I want to get to but his character and his conduct had brought him to another office how many if you want to get to another office amen hallelujah I hope you see it the character of the Pentecostal Baptist Presbyterian Church our character should have us up into a place where we can be in an office to meet the crisis of this hour hello amen the world is in a crisis but cood our conduct and our order and Doctrine is going to help us to meet the crisis of the hour hallu see just to reiterate that his character and his conduct had brought him into another office I hope you see spiritually that's where we are amen amen bringing us to another office to meet the crisis of this hour that we in what a shame we are but will God answer in the time of Crisis watch how God will answer in the time of Crisis brothers and sisters he will not only answer but he will make manifest in the time of Crisis amen how is God going to manifest now amen you and I let's stand together give him praise amen amen so this is a syllabus for adoption don't take the message lightly we've received conduct order Doctrine the full word because that's a syllabus required by the tutor amen thank you [Music] Jesus hallelujah amen just be reverent in his presence the Holy Spirit moving Holy Spirit working on your hearts now that if we find ourselves failing in any of these areas thank you if we can have a tender heart and repent and say Lord forgive me wash me cleanse me Lord your blood still avails oh God I don't maybe I didn't realize that these little things were being held in account to my name yes Lord and the Holy Spirit was bringing a report to the father to say I'm failing in these areas say holy spirit strengthen me now in these areas just be r remember this is not church thank you Lord this is your Eternal salvation thank you this is your future amen yes Lord this is not a religion this is not a gathering just for fun Hallelujah this is to birth Sons and Daughters of God praise the Lord maybe you're had a crisis of faith maybe you stumbled along

brood over your heart right now and say Lord I'm a son and a son accepts correction that's one of the traits of a son the character of a son and daughter is that they have a tender heart to say yes
