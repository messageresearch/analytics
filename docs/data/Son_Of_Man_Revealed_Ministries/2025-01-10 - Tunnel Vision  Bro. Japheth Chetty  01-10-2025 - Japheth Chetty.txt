We'll invite our brother Luke to come. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's welcome our brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] [clears throat and cough] &gt;&gt; Amen.

I greet you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; A said it's going to be prepared, but you really can't get amen used to this place. Amen. Praise the Lord. You know we amen serve with the Lord for such a long time and this is God's holy desk and you really want to make sure that you say the right things and really please God. Amen. So I'm thankful this uh evening to be given this privilege. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To share my testimony with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I haven't spoken like this for a very very long time. So I'm bear with me. I think I'm a little bit nervous. Let me just read the scripture. Amen. Acts 9:4 it says, "And he fell to the earth and and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" I'll just read that portion of scripture. Amen. Please quote. Amen. Yeah, I am a bit nervous. Praise the Lord. Uh I just want to amen appreciate uh God's servant for giving me this opportunity to stand and share my testimony. My testimony is very very complicated and very complex but I'm just going to share just uh snippets of it just so that it can be a blessing to your hearts this evening. Um I just uh I'll just go just a little bit into where I grew up in uh chat with 240. I was a young man and I was growing up in that area. Had dreams like anyone else to be a successful person, study, complete my schooling and so on and so on. But as you know, Satan had his plans. But I also want to say I thank God that God has his plans as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] So Satan short circuited the plan of God in my life. I loved school. I excelled at school while I was at school but I couldn't complete my my schooling because of circumstances. I'm not going to go into details. It was a very rough area against gangsterism and all that. And I got mixed up in those things. You know they say monkey see monkey do. So I got influenced by the things that I saw and the things that people did. That's why it's so important for us to be careful the kind of books that we read, the kind of company that we keep, the kind of places that we go to because these things will influence your character. &gt;&gt; So I was influenced sad to say very negatively in my life and from a very young age I got involved in gangsterism from about 14 years of age. We got mixed up and left school like I said because of circumstances and I just went astray. The years went by, things didn't get better. It began to get worse and worse. I got myself involved in violence, all kinds of things that you could think about. And it just got very, very ugly. And some of the things I'm busy writing a book of my life story. I have to be careful because it have sometimes you can get legal implications. Somebody wanted to do a a little booklet about gangsterism. One young young man is busy talking to me at the moment, but I'm just My sister said, "Just be careful what you do and what you say and that type of thing." So, I really got into a very ugly situation. [clears throat] It was just getting worse and worse and worse by the day. And as I got older and older, I got deeper and deeper. I begin to sink deeper into this deep hole of gangsterism until one day I'm going to go fast forward. [snorts] Uh in 1982 there was a gang fight. I I was involved in that fight. Lots of things happened there. And uh the policeman that arrested me was a Christian policeman. His name was Sergeant John. And he came to the he witnessed the crime scene of the crime and everything that took place and all that. and he came to the to the court to give his evidence and as he was coming he bumped into my sister outside and they started talking my sister said you know my brother is a Christian and Sergeant John says everyone goes to this place and they become Christians he said he said sister you know uh it happens all the time they just look for a easy escape they try to get remission of their sentence judge must feel sorry for them and that type of thing said no you don't understand my brother is is a Hindu we are Hindus we never read the Bible. We didn't have any experience with Christianity. And uh he said, "Okay, let's leave it like that." He said, "If that's the case, then the Lord would speak to me." The policeman stood at the box and he was giving his evidence. And I was standing there and I knew with my previous convictions, I would have got at least about 15 years sentence. And the man asked him questions and asked him, he said, "Sergeant John, you were the assisting officer and you also witnessed the scene of the crime." And he he raised me there and he said, "Your honor, I only witness. I only I was only the arresting officer." And I was frozen on the box because I knew his evidence going to put me away for a long time. But God used that policeman to testify. And the man said, "Why are you wasting the court's time? Why didn't you just get this guy off the if there's no no case, there's no case?" And the case was cautioned this charge &gt;&gt; and I got out. But just before that, while I was in the waiting trial, we were, you know, like I said, we were all messed up and always swearing, using vulgar languages and so on. And I was starting to become quiet and the guy said, "No, this guy is worried because he's going to get a sentence. Just leave. Don't worry about him because he knows he's going for a long time." Then they said I was losing my mind. So I got up. I said, "Guys, no, no, you make a mistake." I said, "It's only now that I found my mind." &gt;&gt; Because while I was in there, &gt;&gt; I had an experience. That's why I read the scripture. I had experience in that place on the corner of the of the building. I got [clears throat] away from all the guys and I was sitting at the corner and uh I started to pray. I said God I don't know whether you Allah, whether you're Buddha, whether you Krishna because we were praying for Buddha, we do karate, you know, we wanted strength and all that. So we always praying for Buddha. We thought Buddha was giving us all the strength. So I said, "God, this is your chance to prove yourself to me." Brothers and sisters, for whatever it's worth, the Lord appeared to me in that waiting trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was not a Christian. I never read the Bible. I knew nothing. I never been to Sunday school. I knew nothing about the Lord. Absolutely nothing. I was just a raw ethe getting messed up, getting involved in violence, doing all kinds of nonsense. And the Lord appeared to me in that waiting trial. &gt;&gt; And when the Lord appeared to me, my whole life was transformed immediately. So within like seconds, &gt;&gt; my thinking was changed. My mind was changed. I went there. I started hugging these guys. I said, "Guys, you don't know what happened to me just now." Amen. &gt;&gt; I said I met with God. Now there were Zenzi guys there. There were Muslim guys or Hindu guys. He asked me which God did you meet now. &gt;&gt; So it was a problem for me because it's difficult. I'm only having experienced the Lord for the first time in my life. &gt;&gt; I no Christian background or anything. &gt;&gt; And I said I said gentlemen I said I met with the Lord Jesus Christ but he said you're not a Christian. He said we know you you're a Hindu. I said that's the problem. I said because all these years I've been a Hindu nothing worked for me. But tonight at 7:00 while I was sitting in that corner, I said the Lord appeared to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My entire life was transformed. When I came out of there, &gt;&gt; one thing led to the next thing. But I'm not going to get into details. But I tell you brothers and sisters, it was such a glorious life. &gt;&gt; And one Sunday morning, we were coming from church. Uh just before that, we just backtrack a bit. I took the youths and went to Caesar. It's up there in clowns somewhere. We used to go and fast and pray for a week. Sometime we spend a month there. So we were busy fasting and praying. We met a brother. I was 5 years in the denomination actively involved bringing souls to the Lord. We started with about 10 or 12 people. Within 6 months we had about 50. The next couple of months it just grew until we had 4 to 500 people. We had a building like this. We had it was a massive building new cottage and the Baptist church was next to us. For some unknown reason they left. We broke the wall. We took the entire building. We had over 500 people within a year's time. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And God just be to bless bless us with capacity with people and that type of thing. People's lives were being transformed and they knew that I gave my heart to the Lord. It was it was catching for them. If this guy can do it then God can do it for us. Many of them came to give their hearts to the Lord. &gt;&gt; So it was 5 years in the denomination and while I was in there I was preaching that Sunday morning and I preached where are the prophets of old? &gt;&gt; I said one of these days I said a person will step on the scene and he'll say thus sayeth the lord. And we said a few things like that on those lines and we left and this young man that used to play guitar in the church. We were walking up and while we were at Cababanu I I met a brother by the name of Andre. He was a police captain. So he was busy preaching talking to me about the message telling me there's a prophet and so on and so on. You know in denomination you start doing your own researches and so on. So we were doing a research on minor prophets and major prophets. And God was so good because this brother came and said brother Benam is a major prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it was easy for me to identify him. &gt;&gt; I said yes. I said, "You're 100% right." He gave me the prophet's life story. He said, "Read the book tonight." I read the book that within that night, the next morning I met the brother. I said to him, "Brother, you are you're absolutely right. This man is a prophet." I said, "There's no way we can deny his entire life. He's a prophet and he's a major prophet." So we agreed. He gave me a set of tapes. The mighty God unveiled. [clears throat] So eventually I said to him, "Brother, why don't you get us together as the youths and have a service with us?" So I was in a dometry in the in the hot house. The youths were in the dometry. Got them all together. We sat on the on the grass. We were having a service. While we having the service, the elders and the deacons came from Kosabatu. They said, "No one's preaching here besides us." So they chased his brother away and he was a police captain. He humbled himself. He packed his bag. He said, "Hey brother, where are you going?" He said, "No, I got to go, brother." I said, "These people don't want me here." And he left. So as it went on, I used to buy books from town, from Living Waters, from 320 West Street, you know, study books for material and stuff. So I went in there, I said, "You know what? I'm looking for books." They said, "What books are you looking for?" I said, "For of this man, William Brandon. Do you all have any books?" They said, "No, we haven't even yet of this man." I went from bookshop to bookshop, Methodist bookshop. Everywhere we started going. I was very, very disappointed. And then we were coming from church that Sunday morning with Robert and myself. As we were walking coming up, he said, "You know what? There's a group of guys here. They they benomites." Said, "You must be very careful because they know how to twist the word." So he said, "We're going to go there, but don't get caught up with these guys. They're very very woody. They can they know how to sle the word and all. Just be very careful." So in my mind, I'm saying I said that's what I did. Said this is the guys that I'm looking for. and and the brother was not even like a few meters away from where I live. His name was Jonathan. So we go to the house. It was uh brother Ivan Deck's wife's brother. So we go there, we sit and we talk and I see them having a strange type of behavior. Everyone just sits, they pray, they read the Bible, he offers her something to drink, his sister comes in, she puts the cool rings and she's gone. I said hey these people are weird you know because people no one's talking and everything is word based then I started asking questions you know we are denomination we hellfire and brimstone so I was fighting like a shotgun I said hey brother what about this what about this pillar of fire believe in the halo and you believe in this the said wait brother hang on let me just show you exodus he said this is it b of fire pillar of cloud so I said my mind okay that's fine that's that's the scripture so you can't deny it so we asked questions we went on until one day we kept kept on we became close friends. I kept on coming to his home sitting having fellowship talking about the scriptures and so on. Then I read a book and he was talking about baptism. I said I came I said brother I need to get baptized. He said no no no brother just wait let me give you a book. I said no I need to get baptized. Brother give me a book. He said convinced and then concerned. So I took the book. I read this book. I came back. I said brother I'm convinced. I'm very concerned. I need to get baptized. So he said okay let me get the pastor. So they took me in the car. They put me pastor George Fybe straight to I river. They baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the sequence of events begin to unfold and you'll find out some of the things I'm going to say. I don't know whether you know they say if you say something he hold it against you. If you don't say it, it's still held against you. So it's a little bit tricky but I'm going to have to say brother you know it's it's for the benefit of us so that you know it make us believers stronger believers and so on. So from there a brother came to work. I was working at UK Zen. He came to me. He said to me, "Brother, uh, are you in the message?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Have you heard about the thunders?" I said, "Thunders, brother?" [clears throat] He said, "Thunders? You didn't hear about thunders?" I said, "No, brother." He said, "No, you must." So, I went, I started checking. Now, those days, no computer and message and all that. You have to read books. &gt;&gt; So, I found the scripture. Seven thunders give you rapturing faith. Seven thunders, the bride's revival. Seven thunders gathers the bread. So, I said, "Hey, there's something about these thunders." But you know what happened? Lo and behold, there were thunder camps that were created. &gt;&gt; We God help us. And God forbid that we ever become an elite group. &gt;&gt; There's no one that's better than anybody else. &gt;&gt; We all were taken out of there from the dust. God blew the breath of life and made us a living soul. &gt;&gt; So I actually wasn't in favor of this, but unfortunately I was caught up in that situation. So as the time went on, brothers and sisters, it went on from one thing to the next. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they were doctrinal issues. There was this brother George Fyberg when he came into the message, he gave me his testimony. He said when he came in, one of the renowned ministers said to him, "Brother, they introduced him to the message." He came into the brother's room, he went one night, they said, "Hey brother, you came too late." He said, "What's wrong?" Said, "Grace is over." [laughter] The brother said, "How can God send a glorious message like this and grace is over?" Many years later, the brothers repented. [laughter] You see many things that is why I'm actually glad that I'm identified with a group of people that love the word. &gt;&gt; I appreciate pastor Adrian. I appreciate ministering brothers, brother Joshua and so on that tries as much as possible. We can make human errors. We can have misunderstandings about things. God will wink at our ignorance. But by the grace of God, these brothers try to keep the message as pure as pure can be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is very important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doctrine crept in. You know the greatest problem that keep the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; brother identified it to a false light. &gt;&gt; He said the greatest train robbery. &gt;&gt; He said they put a false light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They acted as railroad workers. &gt;&gt; They put a false light. They stopped the train and they robbed this train for millions and millions of dollars &gt;&gt; and they got away clean. And that's exactly what's happening in the message of the hour. There are false lights that are being presented. &gt;&gt; But thank God he's given us a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's given us a message that we can hang on to. We can hold on to this message because this message is is a message of purity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't want to take quotes and so on and so on, but I think in all fairness, I'm just going to try and say a few things and then cap it off just with a quote. You know sometimes we take a revelation to somebody for example we hear some things our eyes we're blessed to see what we see and we are blessed to hear what we hear &gt;&gt; it is just the grace of God &gt;&gt; but sometimes you might take this and present it to somebody &gt;&gt; and that person might not see it &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; there are several reasons why they won't see it &gt;&gt; I just put like one about three reasons here and then I'm going to read the code I'm going to try keep to time Because a prophet is subject. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet. So I have to be disciplined. Amen. Sometimes the capacity of the person, you know, think the quote says we like change in God's pocket and so on. &gt;&gt; Sometimes a person is not capacitated to understand in that level. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; We don't expect brother Eden's wife to understand in his capacity. &gt;&gt; She's called to be a housewife. She's got her capacity to understand in that Amen. the capacity God's given her. [clears throat] So God has given us different capacities. Not all of us are called to understanding that capacity. Some of us are called to to minister. Some of us are called just to be church members. So not everyone will understand in that capacity. A 50 cents will not comprehend. Amen. The same amount the way it will be with a dollar. Amen. &gt;&gt; The second part that I wanted to say was that sometime it's not the right time where things that we shared. My wife will remember some of the things we shared with some brothers a deacon of a church. He said, "No, brother, look, I don't agree with you." 10 years later, I said, "Brother, I see it clear now." &gt;&gt; We didn't fight. We didn't argue. We just said, "Brother, video, no problem." Said, "Look, I'm sorry, man." You know, that type of thing. [clears throat] And sometimes it's not meant for them to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we go out to preach the gospel, we're preaching to two classes of people. &gt;&gt; We are preaching to souls that are in prison now. &gt;&gt; It is going to be a witness against them. And then we are preaching to those that are interested in coming the gene seed of God. Like we hear pastor preaching and brother missing brothers talking about the gene seed. Once there's representation and you preach they will respond to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm not going to say anymore. I'm just going to read a quotation from the church ages and then I'll just cap off my testimony. Amen. You see what it says in church ages page 16. It says here, you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages. Then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation &gt;&gt; or we will fail to get it. Amen. We heard pastor saying that a few times without the Holy Spirit, you won't get revelation. &gt;&gt; Bringing these two thoughts together, you will see that it won't just take ordinary studying and thinking to make this book real. &gt;&gt; You can't just have ordinary thinking and ordinary studying. This is a supernatural message. Like you said, brother Romesh. You you can be an intellectual, you can be a theologian, but you'll miss it a million miles. &gt;&gt; He says, "Yeah, it is it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost." That means that this book can't be revealed to anyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. But a special class of people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are a special class of people. Like you said, Amen. We are a special class. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said it will take one with prophetic insight. &gt;&gt; You cannot walk on prophetic land without prophetic glasses. &gt;&gt; I can't see here without these glasses. Amen. So when you get on prophetic land, you got to have prophetic glasses. You got to focus and zoom in your glasses so you can see with clarity. Amen. You won't be amen tossed about by every window of doctrine. Amen. Somebody would come with something and explain something in a certain way. It looks so good. I remember brother came many many years from Congo. He had books. He's got it marked in red, in blue, in green. He sat at my home. He had lunch. I said, "Brother, with due respects, I said we're going to close this conversation." He said, "This book, the church ages that I'm reading from is not inspired." &gt;&gt; I said, "I respect you, my brother." I said, "You can complete your supper." But I said, "Discussion's over. We're not going to talk anymore." &gt;&gt; Because every book that everything that the prophet has been saying is inspired by God. &gt;&gt; This wasn't Amen. a a a normal man coming and speaking. Every day an angel from heaven that you come down. Hallelujah. The angel that you come and unveil, the prophet had his own ideas, his own views. Amen. Uriah Smith and different people. He wanted to take those teachings and explain. But the angel of God had to correct his teachings to bring this glorious message to us. Amen. so that we can enjoy this message. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it will require Amen. It will take Amen. one with prophetic insight. It will require the ability to hear from God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We said those that have have an ear, let them hear. But some people got ears but they're not hearing. Why they're not hearing? Because there's no GC. There's no representation. There's nothing to connect with that word. Amen. So that's the problem. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It will require supernatural instruction. Yes, brother. &gt;&gt; You like that? Amen. Supernatural, brother. This is a supernatural message, brother Josh. Amen. He didn't come to us. Amen. Cheap. Amen. He didn't come. The prophet, Amen, lost his Amen. his child. He had to go through difficulties to problems. Amen. In Amen. in his life story. All that there. Amen. To bring this glorious message. God had to crush that rose. Amen. So that we could receive that fragrance. Hallelujah. And today we can enjoy this message that we that we enjoy so beautifully. Hallelujah. Not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good. Not any student can study and take this thing and go into the concordance and get all this quotes on faith on redemption and all that and preach it. But brother, it takes supernatural instruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So praise God. Not just he said but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. The a mystery requires the teaching of a spirit. Amen. Or it never becomes clear. So without the spirit, the mystery can never become clear. Even though we have the revelation, but he said there's still a supernatural element that still Amen. So praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and yielded to the spirit to hear and to know. Brother, I'm thankful that God has brought this message my way. Amen. I'm very excited and happy. I'm glad to be identified with a group of people that love the [clears throat] message of the hour. And people do everything in their power, Amen, to keep this message in its pure state. Amen. I've been around I've been around to many places. I've been around to many churches. But I want to say God bless you brothers and sisters in this church. May the Lord just raise you up to be mighty warriors in the kingdom of God. Amen. I pray that this testimony has been a great blessing to your hearts. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look just what date did you meet that you said you were in that cell. Tell brother Joshua and brother Jeff what date that was. &gt;&gt; 23rd of July 1982. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when he told me that we knew, you know, Exodus 23:23, I sent my angel before thee. &gt;&gt; So on the 23rd of July 1982 is when the brother had the experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can identify with that. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's just stand together. We'll sing a song as we welcome dear brother Jaffford. Thank you, brother Luke, for that testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate it and thank you for keeping to time. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll get his extended version. I actually wanted him to give his testimony to the youth because I think it'll help them. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he can give his complete testimony to the youth. Praise the Lord. [snorts] Let's [clears throat] just sing a song and worship the Lord as we welcome our brother Jaff. Amen. Let's sing. Hallelujah. Let's sing only believe from you will see you to see and then we'll hand over the service. [music] Only [singing] believe. Only [singing] believe. [singing] All things are [singing] possible. Only [singing] believe. Holy [singing] Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just open up your heart and believe. &gt;&gt; Holy [singing] Mary. &gt;&gt; Say, "All things." &gt;&gt; All [singing] things are possible. [singing] Only [singing] Billy Jesus is here. Jesus [singing] is here. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. All [singing] things are [singing] Jesus is singing. [singing] Jesus is [singing] precious Jesus. Jesus [singing] is here and all things are possible [singing] with Jesus. [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow for a word of prayer. Hallelujah. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father, we come before you once again, Lord. Father, we thank you for this opportunity, oh God, to be gathered, Lord, with saints of like, precious faith. Oh God, Lord, we come maybe from different walks of life, oh God.

And it's good to be back in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are blessed by the testimony. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, that testimony already got me fired up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's two things you mentioned, uh, Brother Luke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You mentioned about it not being the right time &gt;&gt; and you mentioned about focusing. Amen. When you read the quote, &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to see that in tonight's message. Those are the two themes of tonight's message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. For for a title tonight, Amen. We're going to speak on tunnel vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. And for a subject, we're going to speak on perfecting our focus in the age of adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to see how important that is in this hour. Amen. So, let's just turn to our Bibles. Amen. Just to read an opening scripture. We'll turn to Proverbs chapter 4 verse 25. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Proverbs 4:2 says, "Let your eyes look straight ahead &gt;&gt; and your eyelids look right before you." Amen. Let your eyes look straight ahead and your eyelids look right before you. Amen. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of the word. Amen. You may be seated at this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I've got a long break from preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. A few times that it was my my turn to preach, I couldn't make it. So, amen. Um, I had a long break. Amen. So, tonight we just want to talk on this a little subject. Amen. Tunnel vision and perfecting our focus in the age of adoption. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, any preacher is is a good salesman. Amen. &gt;&gt; A preacher is trying, amen, to sell you something. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's trying to sell you, Amen, the heavenly products that God has in his store. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, any good salesman is going to do his very best to present to you, &gt;&gt; Amen. what he has in stock. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But now, you'll find that sometimes a purchaser or viewer might come into the store, brother agent. He might come into the car dealership and he'll find that he'll view every single car and he'll ask questions about every single car [clears throat] &gt;&gt; and the salesman will answer all of these questions. They'll give you all the latest features only to find out at the end that the viewer will say, you know, I'm just looking around. &gt;&gt; You'll find maybe maybe the viewer doesn't even have the money in the bank account. &gt;&gt; So, he's wasting the salesman's time. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it takes a two parts. Amen. The salesman is got to do a good job in presenting what he has to offer. &gt;&gt; But the purchaser has to have the purchasing power. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet tells us that the believer's purchasing power is faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said you can have the dollar bill in your pocket, but you might not have the bread. Amen. But you have the capacity to purchase that loaf of bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight or or whenever a preacher is presenting what is in heavenly stock, Amen. You got to come with a purchasing power of faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that amen when the when the preacher is saying what he has in store and and what he has on sale, you can say here's the money. I want that. Amen. If you have need of healing, you can say, "Amen. Here's my faith. I am I am big of he give me that. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So tonight, Amen. when we are presenting the source of God. Amen. Exercise your faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, Amen. Just on this topic of tunnel vision, I'm pretty sure maybe you would have heard of people uh uh saying this famous saying, you have tunnel vision. &gt;&gt; So, what does that mean? Tunnel vision basically means when someone is looking at something directly in front of them but they are losing sight of the bigger picture. &gt;&gt; Their focus is too narrow. They can't have a context to the broader picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this can be a good thing and it can be a bad thing. So tonight we're going to talk about the the negative side of it first and then we're going to go on to the positive side of it. Amen. And we're going to talk on some very basic fundamental uh Christian beliefs first and then we're going to bring it down at the end to something mature for the bride. Amen. So, amen. So, just let's talk a little bit on the negative negative side of tunnel vision. We if we turn to Matthew chap 23 23 Jesus is talking here to the Pharisees and he says woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithes of mint and anise and and kummen and have neglected the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faith. &gt;&gt; These you ought to have done without leaving the others undone. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Blind guides who strain out the nut and swallow a camel." &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you cleanse the outside of the cup of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisees first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish that the outside of them may also be clean." &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So Jesus here is addressing the Pharisees and the Pharisees as we know at that point were considered the most holy people. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were very strict in their regimen, in their religion, in the service of God, in their traditions, in the law. &gt;&gt; And so the Pharisees were so narrowsighted on what their traditions were and what their opinions were of the law that they missed the whole broader picture of what the law was trying to present. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we know, amen, that the law in itself could not make us perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. The law in fact put us in the prison house. &gt;&gt; Amen. The law was there to show us that we were sinners. &gt;&gt; But the bigger picture that God was trying to show us was that he was going to make a way for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was going to send a perpetuation for our sins who was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So here was Jesus Christ in their midst. Amen. Performing the very works that the word said he would perform. &gt;&gt; Yes. But because they were so narrowsighted in their view and what they thought the law meant, they missed the whole picture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in other words, they had tunnel vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. They could not see the broader picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. We look at another example in John 9:3 and it says they brought him who formerly was blind to the Pharisees. So here this is after now Jesus had healed the blind man. A night was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. And he said to them, "He put clay on my eyes and washed and I can see." Therefore some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God because he do not keep the Sabbath." &gt;&gt; Sure. Now here's a man who they know for a fact was blind. &gt;&gt; Now can you imagine if there was a blind man here and you know from birth this guy was blind or for however how many years he was blind and now his eyes is open and the only thing you can focus on is that Jesus broke the Sabbath. &gt;&gt; You cannot see the supernatural done right in front of your eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this can be the case in the message as well. &gt;&gt; We can go on through the years. Amen. believing the message as law &gt;&gt; and the supernatural is unfolding all around the world amongst the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can miss the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; And you'll come up with things like, "No, but there's a quote that's against that." &gt;&gt; And you'll start to mismatch quotes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's what now the Pharisees were doing &gt;&gt; because Jesus then came and corrected their error and he said, "No, he was not breaking the Sabbath. He was the Lord of the Sabbath." &gt;&gt; Amen. And he came to fulfill the Sabbath. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. So they were mismatching and misrepresenting the actual law. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they in other words they had tunnel vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another scripture. Amen. We're going to go through a few scriptures tonight. Amen. And a few quotes. Amen. Acts 10:9. Now we were speaking about the Pharisees who we know were unbelievers. But now let's look at how even a believer can have tunnel vision at times. Acts chapter 10. About noon the following day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. He became hungry and wanted something to eat. And while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being led down to earth by its four corners. It contained all kinds of for-footed animals as well as reptiles and birds. &gt;&gt; Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter. Kill and eat." &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Surely not, Lord. I have never eaten anything impure or unclean." And then the voice spoke unto him a second time, saying, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean." &gt;&gt; So now here is Peter, and this is after the day of Pentecost. after Peter is filled with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; after Peter has been given the keys, &gt;&gt; but he's so blinded by him wanting to restrain the gospel to his own nation, the Jewish people, that he could not see that God now wants to pass on the gospel to the Gentiles. He could not fathom how God would now take the same gospel that the Jews had received and now hand it over to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; He is blinded by his own pride. Amen. and his own selfish ways that he could not see. And here he is having a vision and the Lord is telling to him eat it. And he even has the audacity to say unto the Lord, no. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is blinded by his narrow vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He could not see the broader vision that the Lord Jesus had for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We look at another example now in Luke 10:38. Amen. We just want to lay this foundation. Amen. Before we get to the main context of our message in Luke chapter 10, that happened as they went and he entered a certain village and a certain woman named Martha welcomed him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary who also sat at Jesus' feet and heard his word. But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she approached him and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore, tell her to help me. And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things, but one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part which will not be taken away from her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so here now Martha is is is is doing all of these helps and and and and [clears throat] basically showing good hospitality to our guest. &gt;&gt; Now here is Jesus now. He's this famous minister in the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's famous amongst all the land. Amen. And here he is in their house. So she's not doing anything wrong now. She's being hospitable to her guest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like if any minister had to come, we would want to be hospitable to them. Amen. maybe would keep them in our house or see to the hospitality or anything like that. Amen. And and hospitality on its own is a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. The apostle Paul talks about these gifts of helps and needs in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now these gifts are important but however these gifts still have to come under subjection to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you see in this context now even though she was doing something good in her own eyes she was missing the broader picture here was Jesus unveiling the word to them &gt;&gt; and it was time and season for Jesus to unveil himself to them and Mary had chosen that good path. &gt;&gt; Now remember that this is the same Mary that was considered an ill-f an ill-famed woman and brought the perfume to anoint Jesus &gt;&gt; in the house of Simon. &gt;&gt; Amen. So she understood now who Jesus was. And so here she was seated at Jesus' feet hearing from Jesus. So in other words, this Mary was positionally placed correctly at Jesus' feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. To hear the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; But now Martha now was not correctly positioned. &gt;&gt; She thought she was doing God a service. &gt;&gt; Amen. But here now Jesus now then corrects her and and now Jesus is now bringing her into the right position. He's dragging her and pulling her from that position into the correct position. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see how Amen. We can have a gift even of hospitality and being good to people. But it needs to be in the right context. It needs to come under subjection to the word. Amen. We got to give the word the preeminences. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now notice after Jesus now corrects her and teaches her and brings her into a position. All right, this is the same Martha now that when it comes time and season for resurrection and life for the resurrection of Lazarus, here comes Jesus. Now, Martha goes to him and said, "Lord, if you have been here, my brother would not have died." &gt;&gt; And now Jesus once again putting her in position says, "I am the resurrection and the life." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the same mother who Jesus has placed is now the carrier of the shout message. Amen. Because she now takes that message to Mary and say the master has come and callth for thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because Jesus had now positionally placed her. And now she was in the right context. Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Now she could have the right vision. Amen. She was no longer narrow focused but she could see the broader picture. Amen. That he was the resurrection and the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when did she have to see it? in time and se season of resurrection and life. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just like that, we are coming out of time and season for resurrection and life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as you said, brother Luke, it wasn't the time yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going to find that God has certain seasons and times for everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in Martha's case now, it had come time and season for resurrection of Lazarus. &gt;&gt; Which is a type now of us. It's come time and season for the resurrection of life to produce the life of Christ again. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are dead to the old man. Amen. And the life of Christ is arisen in us. But in this time, Christ is positionally placing us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and if you have not been positionally placed, he's going to drag you into position because remember, you are saved. He's not going to lose you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he knows how to drag you into position. Amen. So that's why he's doing week in week out. Amen. The word is coming forth. He's positionally placing you. Amen. Perhaps you are straining this way. He's dragging you from that uh corner. Amen. You're straining this way. He's dragging you from that corner. He's bringing you in the right position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He's narrowing your focus. Amen. In the right way. Amen. To focus on the right things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So th those are some of the negative examples. Amen. Of tunnel vision. Amen. But let's look at some of the positive examples of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews chapter 12 says, "Therefore we also since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, &gt;&gt; let us lay aside every weight." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the sin which so easily ens snares us. &gt;&gt; Let us run with endurance the race that he set before us. Now this is a common scripture. Amen. But don't let it go over your heads. Amen. Focus your vision now. Amen. On this time and season. Amen. Looking unto Jesus. Amen. The author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here Paul is telling us to fix our eyes on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now this is a positive version of tunnel vision. In other words, now don't get distracted by the things but keep your vision focused on the right thing. Amen. Keep your vision focused on Jesus. Amen. the author and finish of our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we consider, amen, what the scripture is saying about Jesus here because he was our example. Now, Jesus was a man of vision. We know that Jesus did nothing except he saw the father do it first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was not distracted by what was going on in the land. &gt;&gt; People were trying to pull him into this crowd, trying to make crown him a king, an earthly king. &gt;&gt; People were wanting him to take over the politics of the land. They were wanting him to overcome the Roman authorities and the Roman empires. He did not get distracted by all of that. &gt;&gt; He was focused on the vision of what the father showed him what his time and season was for. &gt;&gt; That is why we know even when he had taken the scroll from the priest. He read the scripture that pertained to his life at that hour time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was 100% focused on what his goals were. &gt;&gt; Amen. We find that even at the age of 12, Amen. when his parents are correcting him for they thought they had lost him &gt;&gt; and now his parents are trying to reprimand him. They've forgotten. Amen. That Amen. who this child was. &gt;&gt; They've forgotten that the angel's message. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that he was Emmanuel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now Jesus corrects them &gt;&gt; and he shows them that he is focused on the father's business. He tells him, "Don't you know I must be about my father's business." &gt;&gt; He was not even at the age of 12, he was not distracted by anything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. So even at a young age, don't get distracted by the things of this world. &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by what this life has to offer you. &gt;&gt; These this life can only offer you temporary things. Amen. And temporary satisfaction. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it seems at in that moment, Amen. when you are indulging in that satisfaction that that is all you need. &gt;&gt; But what does the Bible say? Sin looks pleasing. This was actually Pastor Ronnie's famous scripture. &gt;&gt; He always said this. Sin looks pleasing and appetizing, but when you partake of it, it brings forth death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's only temporary satisfaction. Amen. &gt;&gt; So fill your hunger with the things of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have your focus fixed on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Jesus is our example. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. One time, Amen. Peter was a hindrance to Jesus. Amen. [clears throat] And Jesus was so focused on his mission that he said, "Get thee behind me, Satan." &gt;&gt; Cuz [clears throat] he recognized that this wasn't Peter. This was the devil trying to hinder him. &gt;&gt; Trying to hinder the move of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You see sometimes you might be so focused on your vision and your very family might distract you from it &gt;&gt; or your very brothers and sisters might say something to try and distract you. Now does that mean that they are lost? No sir Peter wasn't lost &gt;&gt; but the Satan Satan can use an opportunity to try and entice you to try and stir you away from your vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't be deterred by what what the enemy is trying to do. &gt;&gt; Stay focused on your vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep your eyes fixed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Tunnel vision. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. [clears throat and cough] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes God might just throw a test your way to see how focused you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might be doing well for a season, [clears throat] might be serving God faithfully, and God throws a test your way. &gt;&gt; He wants to see whether you are going to stray away at the first sign of discomfort, at the first sign of inconvenience. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because God needs rugged soldiers. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not going to take just any baby Christian. Amen. God has rugged sons and daughters of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And those Amen. who are his sons and daughters, he chastises. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's hard, corrective love. &gt;&gt; But it's good love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we got to be focused. No matter what the trials come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Philippians chapter 3 says, "Not that I have already attained or am already perfected, [clears throat] but I press on that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus had also laid hold of me." Brethren, I do not count myself to be apprehended, but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind. Amen. You got to forget those things which are behind you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Reaching forward to those things which are ahead. what that's talking about again your vision. Don't look in the rearview mirror. &gt;&gt; Look forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I press toward [clears throat] the goal of for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, let us as many as are mature. Amen. Not as many who are babes in Christ, &gt;&gt; but as many who are mature, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; have the [clears throat] mind. And if anything you think otherwise, God will reveal this to you. Nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In first Corinthians, Paul says, "Do you not know that those who run a race all run, but one receives the prize? &gt;&gt; Run in such a way that you may obtain it, and everyone who competes for the prize is tempered in all things." Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; but weep for an imperishable crown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore I run. Thus not with uncertainty. Thus I fight not as one who beats the air, but I discipline my body and bring it into subjection. Lest when I have preached to others, I myself should not become disqualified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what is Paul saying here? Paul is likening in the kingdom of God here to kind of let's put it a sports analogy. Amen. If you look at sports and how these athletes operate, Amen. They are not running aimlessly. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a prize to obtain. They are running to win. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is their livelihood. Amen. And they are running to win. And in order to do that, they bring their body in such um a strict regimen. Amen. They subject their body to such harsh circumstances just to condition themselves, Amen. to be able to run the race. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll find that they'll wake up at early parts of the morning and start their run or they'll do these ice bucket challenges where they'll immerse their whole bodies into ice. Why do they do the these things? They conditioning their body to survive. Amen. The conditions of the race &gt;&gt; and the harsh elements of the race. Amen. You'll find even these with these guys running the marathons. Amen. It's not an easy thing. Amen. For example, they're running from Derban to Peter Marsburg. Amen. We can't run from here to the gate. Amen. So how are they able to do this? They have to condition their body. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If they don't do that, they will faint. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So they have to condition their body. Now the gospel, Paul is likening the gospel to this. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you don't condition yourself spiritually speaking, you are not going to last in this race. &gt;&gt; And that's the honest truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you think you're just going to get by laxidasical, that's not going to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul is saying even myself as a preacher. Now here's the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the greatest apostles, he wrote majority of the New Testament. He saw the third heavens. &gt;&gt; He said, I saw things there that are not even lawful to speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here he comes now and he says, I myself have to bring my body under subjection so I am not disqualified after having preached the gospel. &gt;&gt; Now if Paul this great apostle have to do that, how much more us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to bring oursel under subjection to the word, to the will of God. Amen. We got to subject ourselves to prayer and fasting and reading the word. Amen. These are things that are going to condition us for the race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember, God has not left us without the right elements, amen, to obtain the prize. He's given us the message of the hour. He's given us the right spiritual diet. Amen. He's given us the right vitamins, amen, that we need. &gt;&gt; But we've got to take it in. &gt;&gt; We've got to condition ourselves. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And we are not running aimlessly. Amen. We are running because we we know we are going to obtain the prize. Amen. We know we are going to obtain the body change. Amen. We know there's this promise of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that we are coming back to what Adam lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we are not running aimlessly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. And you'll find that even Amen. farmers when with their horses, Amen. they would put blinders on the hors's eyes. And the reason for this is that it is to prevent distraction of the horses so that they could run straight in a straight line. So they would put blinders on the sides of the horse's eyes. So when the horse is running, the horse could only look straight ahead. Amen. So in other words, the horse had narrow vision. He had tunnel vision. Amen. And that is what amen the word is trying to do week and week out. It's trying to blind us with the things of the world. It opened our eyes to the things of God and veils us to the things of the world. Amen. It's a protective veil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You find even athletes in the Olympics and so forth. Amen. They don't look at the sideways when they are running. They have to keep looking forward when they are running. Amen. They are keeping their vision. Amen. [clears throat] Amen. Last scripture that we're going to read. Amen. Colossians chapter 3, &gt;&gt; he says, "Even then you were raised with Christ. Seek those things which are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth." &gt;&gt; For you died and your life is hidden with Christ. &gt;&gt; In other words, you are you are no longer living your own life. Amen. The life of Christ is living through you. When Christ who is our life appears then you will appear with him in glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So we see amen. The positive side of tunnel vision. Amen. We got to have a focused vision on Christ. Amen. We got to know what we are running for in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you see in the message of the hour, we've [clears throat] come through all of these years. Amen. And many people along the way have got distracted by many distractions. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. They'll join one camp and get focused on one set of doctrine, &gt;&gt; perhaps the thunders. Then they'll they'll have another camp and they'll focus maybe just on the seven virtues. Then they'll have another camp that will focus on saying that the rapture has already taken place and we are living in the millennium. All kinds of different distractions, &gt;&gt; but they have tunnel vision to what the broader context of the message came to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the message tonight is to say do not miss the broader picture of what God is trying to do. &gt;&gt; And you will find that throughout the years, amen, we've learned many things and God was taking us through foundational phases. &gt;&gt; God, remember God is building a building here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's had to lay the foundation because remember what the canker worm and the caterpillar and so forth eaten of God had to restore. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were not starting off a church like it was in the book of acts when Paul had laid the foundation because throughout the dark ages that foundation was lost &gt;&gt; right so here comes the prophet of the age now he's setting correct now all these different doctrines and even doctrines that Luther had brought the doctrine of justification &gt;&gt; and Wesley had brought the doctrine of sanctification even they did not bring it to its full capacity [clears throat] the prophet in this hour has revealed true justification has revealed true sanctification. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's taken all these years, amen, for this foundation to be built up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now in this age now of adoption when God is placing us. &gt;&gt; Now we can see the broader context of what God was trying to do. He might have looked back with dresses, long dresses and they don't watch TV or they don't do this. It looked like that. Amen. But now when we come through all the years and we are now coming to maturity, we can see the broader picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can see that God has taken us back. Amen. To the garden of Eden. Amen. &gt;&gt; Adamic conditions again. Amen. The manifestation of sons in this hour. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is why my subject for tonight is perfecting our vision in the age of adoption. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you'll find here the the prophet said when the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostal people, they began to restore back the gifts and things that was in the church. They thought because they were born of the spirit that settled it. Now here is where we got to pay attention. Amen. Because many people think if you're just born of the spirit that's enough. But you see there is a placing of a son and after the son proved to be a real son then he was taken into the public place. Amen. We know this. We've been through this. And then was set up and changed robes and set up there and they were placed in the sun. Amen. God did the same thing by his son on Mount Transfiguration. He was overshadowed by a cloud and was transfigured and his rayment shined like the sun. And the voice said, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." Amen. You see, in this age now, when the bride comes, amen, to full adoption, God can say, "Behold my beloved sons and daughters." Amen. In whom I am well pleased to dwell in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And remember, she is the final voice to the final age. So God can say, "Yeah, he her." Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm I'm well pleased." Moses and the law had failed and this is him. Yay him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was placed. And the prophet says, "But people today are somewhat like Peter and them was on the mount transfiguration." They got all enthused [clears throat] &gt;&gt; when they seen the supernatural done. Amen. Like a lot of message people when they hear all these supernatural testimonies from William Brandon's ministry, they get all enthused. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they say, "We'll make one church of prophets, one to Moses." Amen. like the Pentecostals did, we'll make one assembly of God, one church of God, one oneness, and so forth. But while he was yet speaking, Jehovah cried out, this is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, while Amen, we could see all these supernatural things that God was doing in the life of the prophet. Amen. People began to get enthused. Amen. People begin to start all kinds of sex and they get stuck in that. Amen. But while all of that is happening, God's word is speaking. Amen. God is saying they can see a man William Bron. Amen. The son of man is speaking. Amen. Amen. The true messenger of the age which is Christ in the hour. He's speaking. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says here him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because William Brandon's hobby is to hunt. Now you want to start hunting. &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because William Brandon wore that kind of a hat. Now you want to wear that kind of a hat. &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by the man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. In fact, you can disagree with William Brand about many of his personal opinions if you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those were his personal opinions. He might have liked the color red. You might like the color blue. &gt;&gt; But Amen. The messenger of the hour which is Christ was veiled in that in that man. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he spoke the word of God, that is the message of God. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is why God could say yeah him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. That is why our example is Christ. Our example is never a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither is our example the family of the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's one mistake people make a lot of the time. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. [snorts] Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They'll see pictures maybe of the prophet's wife and they say, "No, the prophet's wife had a skirt here so we can wear a skirt to this level." &gt;&gt; That's not the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet's wife is not the example of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. They'll say the prophet's daughter had a fringe here and trimmed her hair here. But then the prophet comes and corrects that and he says, "I didn't tell her to do that. She as a teenager went and cut it on her own." &gt;&gt; But you can take that out of context and say, "No, look, the prophet's daughter did it, so we can do that, too." &gt;&gt; You see, they are not the examples of the word. &gt;&gt; Because if you take that, then you're going to have to now follow the follow the tape ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes. And you're going to have to now sit at home and press play &gt;&gt; because a family of the prophet is saying that's what you need to do &gt;&gt; and not go to church. You see the word of God is our example. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, here's what she was talking about, brother Luke. The prophet says, "I got a camera up here coming down. I didn't know how to take a picture. I looked through the thing and man, I could see five or six different objects. So, I began to focus it." &gt;&gt; Amen. and he began to focus the camera. &gt;&gt; And when he focused it, it all came to one picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why when you look at the message, you've got to have the right focus. Amen. Otherwise, you're going to see a whole lot of different things. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying one thing in this code, he's saying one thing in this code. But if you don't focus it right, Amen. You're not going to get the clear picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God gives us the Bible. &gt;&gt; The Bible is the word. The word is God. So that is our binoculars. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word is our binoculars. &gt;&gt; In other words, everything that you look at, you look at through the word of God. That's our glasses. &gt;&gt; When we go to looking in the Bible and seeing four or five different ways, it needs focusing. &gt;&gt; We got to bring it the thing into place where we see the one solemn purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. That's what I'm trying to trying to portray to you tonight is to focus our vision on the one solemn purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We still coming to the second part. Amen. After we narrow our focus, what is the time and season? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you got to have a narrow focus on the word of God and you've got to be in the right time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, what is what is the purpose of God? What is the one solemn purpose of God? Amen. Now we know Genesis is the seed chapter. &gt;&gt; So if you want to know what's the purpose of God, surely God would have put it in the beginning of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's many things we can focus on many doctrines like dressing and baptism [clears throat] and all of these things. Amen. But what is the purpose of God? And we're going to address Genesis, but we're not going to read it from the just the scripture. We're going to read it from pick up your pen and write. Amen. Because we know pick up your pen and write is the letter to the bride. Amen. a letter to the church and God is revealing secrets to the bride in this letter. Amen. The prophet says here, here is what I'm trying to say to you. The law of reproduction. Look at how he starts now. &gt;&gt; The law of reproduction, that's how he starts off his letter. And what does Genesis start off with? The same thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is each species brings forth after its own kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even according to Genesis 1:11. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth." Amen. So here the prophet is automatically taking you to Genesis and saying if you want to look at what the purpose of God is, you got to look at Genesis. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God had seeds that he had planted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God's original purpose that every seed that he planted must bring forth after its own kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now when we narrow the focus now of the whole message, we are narrowed down to what is God's whole purpose. God's seed must bring forth after its own kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what are all of these additional doctrines? Baptism and so forth. Those are to guide you on your journey to coming up to that stage where you can bring forth after your own kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's giving you the spiritual nutrients that you need. It's giving you the watering that you need. It's giving you the sunlight that you need so that that the seed within you can produce after its own kind. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because because it's the seed. It's the same seed. In these last days, the true bride, Christ seed will come to the headstone. And we know this code. Amen. She'll be a super church, a super race as she nears him. Why? Because it's already laying within the seed. Amen. Not because he's going to make you a super church. Not because he's going to make you an invincible army. The potentials are laying within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all God is doing is just watching the seed &gt;&gt; as you are laying in the presence of the sunlight. Amen. God is watching the sea and it's growing and growing and growing. Amen. They will be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. Denominations cannot produce this. Why? Because it's wrong seed. They will produce their creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word. Now let me ask you this question. If we can see the fruits of the denomination, &gt;&gt; we can see that it's wrong seed. Why? Because we can see the fruits. &gt;&gt; So if the denomination can display the fruits of the wrong seed, then surely we can see the fruits of the true seed in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we know that if there's a bogus dollar, there has to be a genuine dollar. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if the false seed, the seed of discrepancy is displaying its fruit in this hour. Amen. The true seed of God is also displaying the fruit in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary, but the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest. &gt;&gt; See, it looks like this message came to Mary, but what was the message? It was the word himself to be made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was to unveil himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And notice that when the angel gave the message to Mary and Mary said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; Mary did not do anything else. to produce that seed within her. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost overshadowed her. Amen. So when you receive the angel's message, now remember the angel is the messenger to the age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet might have left the scene, but the angel is still here. &gt;&gt; And when when you receive the message of the angel, &gt;&gt; Amen. that will produce in itself. Amen. &gt;&gt; What it's supposed to produce. &gt;&gt; Now Mary did have to face the child bearing herself. She had to face the trials, the pains, the birth pains herself. Amen. And that's what the church has to face. You have to face the birth pains. You have to face the trials. You have to face walking around for 9 months. Amen. With a heavy tongue. Amen. You've got to go through all of that. But you do not have to produce the life. &gt;&gt; God produces the life. Amen. Why? Because it's very is his own life. Amen. Produced in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride has the mind of Christ. For she know what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride has perfect focus. Amen. &gt;&gt; She performs the command of the word. She has thus said the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like a seed that is planted and watered. Like we said, we the seed now we are laying every week being watered in the presence of the sunlight. We are being watered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It comes to full harvest serving its purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every seed that God has planted must come to full harvest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you didn't plant the seed. God planted the seed. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice how God now, now we're going to move in time and season. Amen. Notice how God did not move Israel or let her go into the promised land until it was his own appointed time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the people might have put pressure on Joshua, the leader, and said, "The land is ours." That's true. &gt;&gt; The land is theirs. Let's go and take it. It was prophesied. &gt;&gt; Joshua, you are all through. &gt;&gt; You might have lost your commission. You don't have the power you used to have. &gt;&gt; You used to hear from God and know the will of God and act quickly. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was one time, Amen, when you needed to act quickly and you ask the son to stand still and he obeyed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So why the people wants [clears throat] to know why we're not moving anymore? &gt;&gt; Amen. But Joshua was a God-sin prophet and he knew the promises of God. &gt;&gt; So he waited for them. &gt;&gt; He was patient. &gt;&gt; He waited for a clearcut decision from God. And when the time came to move, God placed the full leadership in Joshua's hands because he was he had stayed with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see, yes, we have all these promises. The bride is a super race, super church. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are sons and daughters to manifest the word in this hour. Yes, we've known that for years and years. In fact, we've preached adoption for years and years. Amen. But it was not time and season as yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a time and season for everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now we see we are coming to time and season. Amen. For the sons and daughters of God to be manifested. Amen. The age of adoption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophecies and people tried to do it within themselves. &gt;&gt; This is why they got stuck in so many different camps throughout the years. &gt;&gt; They knew that there was all this potential &gt;&gt; in [clears throat] the message. &gt;&gt; The bride is a super church. They knew all of this potential, &gt;&gt; but they could not wait for time and season. &gt;&gt; So what did they do? They ventured without authority. &gt;&gt; They presumed that this was it. They presumed that when they had Amen. their version of what the thunders were that that was it. &gt;&gt; Amen. They could not wait for time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Moses, we look at Moses. Amen. Moses, Amen, knew, the prophet says Moses knew that he was the messenger of that age. &gt;&gt; The Bible might not directly say it, but the prophet revealing it to us is that Moses knew he was the appointed messenger of the age. &gt;&gt; He knew that God called him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Moses knowing that now tried to do it in his own strength. He thought, "Here am I. I've got enough strength now. I'm young. I've got all of this might and all of this military training and all of this." And he tried to do it in his own strength. &gt;&gt; He had the correct word. God was going to deliver them. God was going to send him a deliverer. He had the correct word, but not time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there come an hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says when it was time and season, Moses had to meet the burning bush. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says, that's what's the problem with the church today. They have not met the burning bush. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have not come to time and season. Amen. Where they've had an encounter with [clears throat] God. &gt;&gt; They've heard. Yes. All of these promises. The children of Israel knew all of these promises. It was prophesied from the days of Abraham. Your seed is going to so journey in a strange land and I'm going to deliver them. They've had all these promises, &gt;&gt; but they did not have the burning bush experience. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's see what the prophet says is the burning bush experience. He says, "Then when God revealed himself to him in the burning bush, he found out then that the very thing that was in the burning bush was the thing that he lacked." So prophet, what was in what was in the burning bush? Do we have to see a physical pillar of fire? Do we have to see the supernatural with our very eyes? What is the burning bush experience? The prophet says, and I think that's a whole lot of us today, that many times we try to do the program ourselves and fail to get what is in the burning bush, which is the direct revelation of the will and time of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you have a direct revelation of the will and the time of God, you have come into contact with the burning bush. You have come into contact with the pillar of fire because remember who is the pillar of fire? It's Christ the messenger &gt;&gt; and the messenger is leading us and and the messenger is going to lead us with amen the word of God and the time and season of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know Amen. the famous saying amen the famous scripture to everything under the sun there's a time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So just like that in God's promises there's time and season. &gt;&gt; God has times and seasons for his word. Amen. And the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick. So the prophet is given an example. Now he'll say and the scripture says at certain times the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick. That's when Jesus was ministering too. At the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick. Maybe at other times the presence of the Lord was not there to heal the sick. &gt;&gt; So Amen. There's even a time and season for healing. You might be praying for so many years for your healing. But don't lose hope. You got to wait for time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet prayed and prayed for years and years until he received his healing. Many other people received the healing through his own ministry. &gt;&gt; But he himself had to wait for years and years until he received his own healing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't be despondent. Amen. When the promises of God take time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because it's the word of God. It must come to pass. &gt;&gt; It's a seed. It must come to pass. It must bring forth a harvest. The harvest doesn't come forth at the same time that the seed is planted. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to go through a time and season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that is why tonight we are speaking on perfecting and narrowing our vision in time and season. Amen. In the age of adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now you'll find that for many years, amen, in the message we, amen, preached on different things, but you will find that nothing was really emphasized on times and seasons. &gt;&gt; They've had the word. Amen. They've broken down the word. Amen. What the word is, what the revelation of the word is, and given us a good foundation, a good understanding of what the word is. Amen. But you'll find, amen, even in our local assembly, amen, that from 2023, a certain emphasis started being placed on time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll find that before that we were we were never that focused on time and season. We are focused on what the word is, what the seven seals are, what the seven church ages are. Amen. What the serpent seed is, all these things that we had to learn. Amen. That is the word and the will of God. But you'll find now that we come a time where God is emphasizing time and season. &gt;&gt; Everything that we've learned, &gt;&gt; everything that has been planted, it's now coming time and season for the harvest. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why is the theme of this year? &gt;&gt; The theme for our church this year, amen, is the opening of dimensional doors. &gt;&gt; What is that talking about? Time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Time and season that God has opened up certain doors to us. certain manifestations, certain blessings, certain anointings, certain levels of the Holy Spirit in time and season. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we now know the will of God. We know the word. Remember the bride has thus say the Lord, she has the mind of Christ. She knows what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; But now she has [clears throat] time and season. Amen. Time and season of adoption being placed in this hour. Sons and daughters of God. Amen. Hallelujah. In the hour of resurrection, like Martha, in the hour of resurrection, the bride has been placed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. No other time. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when the life of Christ is ready to be manifested, she's placed in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I pray you've been blessed through that tonight. Amen. That's &gt;&gt; the main emphasis of the message. Amen. God is narrowing our focus, perfecting our focus in time and season of the bride age. Amen. In the age of adoption. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's stand to our feet. Amen. Hallelujah. God is good. [applause] Amen. Hallelujah. We have the word of God. We have the word of God. We have time and season. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the age of adoption. Don't mess it. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not the age, Amen. to be a baby in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not the age. Amen. To want milk of the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are now mature sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam was coming into a full stature of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus as he has grown up from an infant was growing up into the full stature of the word. And we too, Amen. receiving the word all through the years. We are now grown up into the full stature of the word. Now it's time to manifest. Amen. Time and season to manifest. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, we pray narrow our vision. Oh God, &gt;&gt; let us not be distracted. Oh God, &gt;&gt; let us see what you are trying to do in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us not be like father what the prophet said people are always looking at the past. &gt;&gt; They are always looking at the future what you're going to do but missing what you're doing now. &gt;&gt; Lord let us see the whole picture. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh let us not have oh lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord the picture wrong father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to have the picture right. Father. &gt;&gt; Oh we want to be focused oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And father we want to walk in time and season. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us. Like your prophet said so many times, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Noah's message would not have walked in Moses day, &gt;&gt; Moses could not go down the Nile River with the ark to deliver the people of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like that, we've got our message for this hour time and season. Amen. Let's stay focused on what you're trying to reveal to us, oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, we pray, Lord, just perfect our vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't Don't you want to ask that to him tonight? Amen. Say, "Lord, perfect my vision, Father. Oh, take away every distraction, oh God. Perfect our vision, oh God. Oh, let us walk in time and season, oh God. Oh, we bless your name, oh God. We thank you, oh God, that what you're doing in this hour, oh God. Father, you are showing to us, oh God, what you are doing, Lord. You've not left us in the dark." &gt;&gt; Lord, Father, like you said to Can I hide from Abraham? What am I going to do? Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, you have not hid from your elect what you're doing in this hour. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, let us not miss it, Lord. &gt;&gt; In this hour, Lord, let us lay in the presence of the sun. Oh God, let us bring forth, oh God, the fruit of the hour, Lord. Oh God, that every hour Lord had different fruit to present, Lord, God. And in this hour, Lord, we are presenting the fruit of maturity, oh God. The fruit of maturity of your word, father, the perfect understanding of your word, the perfect realization of your word, the perfect manifestation of your word. Oh Lord, it's a mature word. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you Lord in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are not just, oh Lord, Father, phased now by winds of doctrines. Lord, we are not just phased by, oh Lord, just the laying hands of the sick, oh God, or speaking in tongues or any of these things, but we are now coming to the full maturity of the word. Oh God, thank you, oh God, for sending a prophet. Thank you for sending a messenger in this hour. Thank you for coming down yourself, oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, all of heaven stood silent, oh God, because there was silence in heaven, oh God, when the mighty angel descended in this hour, oh God. Oh, we thank you, Jesus. Blessed be your holy name. Amen. Hallelujah. You are worthy. You are worthy of all praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to call our pastor a forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He's worthy of all praise. Worthy of all glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's sing. Amen. Even as we call our pastor Aan forward. I want God's way to be my way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I want God's [singing] way to be my way as I journey [singing] [singing] [singing] a child of watching you go. Though the road [singing] seems deep and rough, if he leads [singing] me then I go to my every day. [singing] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We blessed of the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We certainly blessed. Amen. Hallelujah. Keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the author and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you feel you're growing into maturity? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord is positioning you, placing you into your position where Amen. He's able to walk through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we must be able to feel that way &gt;&gt; because when we were new babes in Christ, we knew that we were new babes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are hungered after the the milk and we hungered after those things. &gt;&gt; But as we start to mature, we we ought to notice signs of maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And where God is taking us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we appreciate the word of the Lord, brother Jeff. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a tremendous blessing to be in the service tonight. Can I pray? Amen. We'll go and ponder upon these things because the Lord is certainly doing a work in and through our lives. Amen. Let's continue to sing and worship him and &gt;&gt; give him glory and praise. Amen. &gt;&gt; There many needs, many prayer requests, but we can come before the Lord to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, we've got to take our position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we realize who we are, we speak with the voice of authority. &gt;&gt; We speak Amen. Because the authority came from our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; He came to position us and place us so we can't be speaking from a point of weakness, from a point of strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I can just imagine that eagle in the chicken. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had limited vision. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He had limited line of sight, &gt;&gt; but once he left that chicken &gt;&gt; and he got up into the heavenlies, &gt;&gt; he had a panoramic view. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He could see the entire picture. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. He was soaring into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's no way you could convince that eagle to go back to that bar. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank [clears throat] you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had been set free. Hallelujah. And he whom the son have set free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give God glory and praise. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he worthy of praise? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He's taking us, leading us to greater heights. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing and worship him. Thank you Lord for saving my soul. Thank you Lord for healing me. Thank you for delivering me Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I worship you. Almighty [singing] God. [music] There is none [singing] like you. &gt;&gt; Sing I worship you.
