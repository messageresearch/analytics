[12:34] preeminence in the life of people people
[12:37] put so much in their government they

[14:11] very thing that will guide you the very
[14:14] thing that will protect you the very
[14:16] thing that is going to give you
[14:17] salvation yes even today they put stigma
[14:21] on the message and say oh it is son uh
[14:24] Prophet message this message is not a
[14:28] Prophet message amen it is from the
[14:31] Throne of God God used the prophet to
[14:35] bring his
[14:36] word praise the Lord amen thank you Lord
[14:39] some say he made a
[14:42] mistake but I tell you Brethren that
[14:46] every mistake of a prophet is a
[14:49] message Moses made a mistake but that
[14:53] was a message to you and I to learn from
[14:55] yes Isaiah made a mistake yes yes
[14:59] he was just looking at the king the king
[15:02] had prospered and asai was just behind
[15:05] the king until the king one day went to
[15:08] the temple try to offer sacrifice he
[15:11] told him King oh that this is not your
[15:13] place he said believe me I am the king I
[15:16] can do anything and God Str him with
[15:18] Leprosy when that happened Isaiah came
[15:21] to
[15:22] himself when he want to pray and then
[15:24] God revealed to him Hallelujah so every
[15:28] prophet

[34:35] out your body is laying there dead but
