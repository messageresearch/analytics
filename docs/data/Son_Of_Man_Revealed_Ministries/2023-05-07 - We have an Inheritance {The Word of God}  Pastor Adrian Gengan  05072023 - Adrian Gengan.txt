precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen to be in the house of the Lord to worship Him amen welcome everyone amen let's turn to the book of Ephesians amen just want to exhort a little bit and then you can have a time of prayer amen how many of you've been blessed with the services amen I mean if you can see that we are growing in Christ amen hallelujah one of these days is it's going to explode into a body change amen amen now if you're looking forward to that thank you Lord it's only the word and do that for us amen hallelujah amen thank you let's read Ephesians chapter one amen so we'll read from verse 7. in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace amen amen so everything was done in the blood of Jesus amen he was the perfect sacrifice amen and when he shed his blood it was finished thank you Lord amen amen everything was stricken off to the one that now accepts the blood and believes on Jesus right amen wherein he had abounded to us with to us would Us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that's under that seventh seal now you've you're going to do a study on the fullness of times you'll see it's at the time of the seventh seal being opened amen having made a known unto us the mystery of his world according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ amen both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen so remember Revelation 5 comes into view here now because that's when he's going to take the book of Amen the book of redemption in whom also we have obtained an inheritance amen and that's what our speaker but on this evening amen we have an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him will worketh all things after the counsel of his own will now if we observe what he's saying here being predestinated according to the purpose of him now if you drop two verse 5 you'll see what we were predestinated to having predestinated us unto the adoption of children amen amen by Jesus Christ himself right so that's the purpose that we should be now this is verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom also he trusted after that he heard the word of truth yes the gospel of ourselves of your salvation you know also after you believed you were sealed when that Holy Spirit of Promise so after you believe you must receive the Holy Ghost have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe so you see the progression of scripture after you believe you receive the Holy Ghost which is the earnest of our inheritance so we have an inheritance the Holy Ghost is the earnest of the itineritance amen until the Redemption of the purchased position unto the praise of his glory amen you may be seated the Lord with blessings to the reading of his word you just want to deal with on the blood there if you turn to Hebrews chapter 9 amen Hebrews chapter 9 you'll see here from verse 13. let's read from verse 11 then Jesus being the sacrifice but Christ being come and I priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with the hands that is to say not of this building so remember when Jesus came in the flesh there was a body that was created and he created a body and he injected himself into the human race amen but that body was still subject to death that wasn't a perfect body because Jesus was Aging in that body yes sir amen many times Jesus had to escape if they caught him they would have killed him yeah and even the fact that they killed Jesus showed that he was he could physically die in that body so that's what he is saying now he's no longer in that body but he's in a perfect Tabernacle amen he resurrected in a body not made with hands amen and the Bible says when we see him we shall be like him so we are coming into glorification amen amen hallelujah amen not made with hands that is to say not of this building so he says neither by the blood of goats or calves but by his own bloody entity once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for Allah what is redemption bringing back everything that was lost amen amen amen hallelujah for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an evil sprinkling the unclean Sanctified the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God Amen amen amen and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that's the New Covenant now that by means of his death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance amen amen so Christ bought our sin died on the cross and our sins died within amen and we were resurrected to life yeah so everything that Christ had he now gave to us amen we gave him our sin and he gave us eternal life he gave us an eternal inheritance amen amen hallelujah not only that now he's restoring us back into full Dominion Hallelujah power over the Earth amen amen that's what is redeeming us back to what we have fallen from amen men in our present condition in our fallen condition is not God's original image yes sir amen so Christ has put us back in our image where there is it for where a testament is they must also of necessity be dead of the testator nobody can receive an inheritance once the person is living yeah amen and if you know you only receive the inheritance when the person dies amen hallelujah ah thank you Jesus amen and if you know the Bible says that we were died in Christ we were buried in Christ and we rose again in Christ amen so there's something about the Tomb in Jerusalem even now you can go to that tomb and people amen go there for pilgrimage and they see that empty tomb amen but it's not only a representative of Jesus dying being buried and risen again it's also a testament of you and I amen that in that tomb amen our sins died we were buried in Christ amen and if you look for our sins then you can't find it anymore amen thank you Father amen there's nothing there to testify he says for a testament is a force after men are dead so a will is enforced after someone is dead otherwise it is it is of no strength at all while the testated living you can look at your father's will while he's alive all day long and imagine what you're going to get but the only time you become possessed so of it is when he dies amen and our father came on Calvary 2000 years ago to die amen I'm driving this point because I want you to understand are we in Eternal inheritance that we have amen whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of the clouds and goes with water Scarlet will and his soup and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God had enjoyed unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the lower Purge with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission amen hallelujah amen the scripture is packed I can go on reading and reading amen hallelujah but let's read chapter 10 verse 9 there he says lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he might establish the second by the which will we we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all and every pre-standard daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sin but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from ends forth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he had perfected um forever amen them that are sanctified now this now watch the progression Right Way of the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us amen amen amen for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them amen so now remember Satan comes as a deceiver yes he comes to make you feel that you still need to achieve something yeah you still need to attain something and you still need to do something to attain Perfection but in Christ we are already perfect amen amen amen Hallelujah the Bible says our sin was nailed to the cross yeah yeah amen sin meaning the root of sin unbelief itself was nailed to the cross we that are risen with Christ we are Faith because we believe in Jesus Christ and all that Christ died for already aim to achieve amen by restoring everything that Adam lost he had restored back to the believer amen now if you go if you go to the Book of Genesis here you'll see that God is calling Abraham and we're talking about inheritance now right and he tells him this man is an idol worshiper remember after the days of Noah came forth amen they were building Babylon and after this comes the story of Abraham or his name is Abram you'll find a lot of the story and sometimes when we preach it we talk to about him being Abraham but Israeli Abram he only received the body the name change at a specific time yes amen amen hallelujah so you find here in Genesis chapter Genesis chapter 12 his way he calls Abram the Lord calls him and tells him get thee out of thy country and thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land I will show thee now that's an inheritance amen yes only if you like inheritance you like it how many of you want to watch some of you say honor I want to be make myself my own man I want to work to achieve everything on my own I don't want nothing from nobody amen who would want to do that if your father has given you an inheritance would you want to walk to attain something on your own or do you want to dwell and live in that inheritance live up the blessing of that inheritance amen so he tells him I'm going to lead you into a land that I will show you I will make up be a great nation our bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing amen amen every one of us are in different stages of our journey amen and if I have to ask you what is hindering you from obtaining all of your god-given privileges in Christ there is something hindering you amen say something hindering you and if you tell me there's nothing hindering you I want you to go to a tree and speak to it and curse the tree and see if the tree obeys you that's the goal amen if I could paint a picture for you and tell you and ask you what was the opening of the seals for why was titled deep brought back down to the Earth amen if we can see the end if we can see the end goal that Christ has come to redeem us and put us back in before the fall that when Adam spoke in the winds the Seas the trees nature obeyed him yes amen we are coming back to a God faith amen yes amen and in order to have a god-like faith because we are amateur Gods on the Earth amen amen what have we got to do Hallelujah we have got to speak the word of God amen heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away sometimes we are through you speaking our own words sometimes our own words will fail but we've got to use the word of God Amen Jesus himself used the word of God when the enemy came to him he used the word of God and sometimes we can't use the word of God because we don't know the word of God we don't know the promises of God amen amen there's nothing that can be able to stand before us at this time in this hour in this season if we know the word of God and can apply the word of God thank you amen yes and we need to build ourselves upon the word of God why did Brother Branham come at the end of seven Church ages something was lost from the church the true word was taken away from the people amen yes he came to restore us back to the world amen amen hallelujah so my question is how well do you know the Bible how well do you know the word how well do you know the promises of God to apply the word amen how well do you know the word to make it possible to you amen hallelujah the reason we cannot see the effects of it is because we don't know the word of God and if you don't know the word of God you can't have faith in the word of God we are presumptuous about many things many times we have hope and many times we are calling and praying to God and asking for things and begging him for things when we don't need to be Beggars that's right amen thank you yes amen I want you to go read Jesus life story to read the four Gospels and see every time people came to him did he now start a long prayer did he pray for the woman with issue of blood did he pray for the Centurion servant did he how many how many times has Jesus prayed are you in His image and likeness Jesus speaks to the Fig Tree amen and what happens the Fig Tree obeys the Creator amen amen huh let's go to Genesis 1. Genesis 1. 26. I told you if I can show you the end goal of what the opening of the Lord came to do is to make you back into the image of God after his likeness amen then we are going to do everything to achieve and move towards them drive away all unbelief because there's nothing left to be open all the mysteries of God are revealed amen what denominations try to do and hide the word and twist the word Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7 came and fulfilled his part to reveal the Mysteries right so there's nothing can be hidden from us and God said let us make man in our image is that you yes yes right after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea this is what you ought to be now dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over the Earth and over every creeping thing that we put upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so man has Dominion on the earth listen to Psalm 18 quickly to show you something here sorry proverbs 18. hallelujah amen glory be to his name amen amen amen you love the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen we've got to come back to our original purpose amen sorry sorry my mind is racing at 100 miles per hour now and I'm tying up scriptures I need to get to Psalm 115. Psalm 115. so remember what we said man is created after his image his likeness to have dominion on the earth Psalm 115 verse 16. here now what the Bible says the heavens even the heavens are the Lords but the Earth as he given to who sense even the heavens are the Lords but the Earth had the given to the Children of Men so if God wants to do anything on the Earth who must you work through amen amen surely the Lord God will do nothing on the Earth amen why did you always need man to cooperate with him because God is a spirit amen amen hallelujah so he is God of the heavens he's God of all creation but he plays man to have dominion on the Earth amen we are coming back to a god man yes amen a god-like image yes amen we are driving at all unbelief amen we are driving on all fear and that's what's keeping the people down right now fear yes amen and Jesus said in Mark 11 23 if you can believe your own words if you say to this mountain be thou removed yes crash into the sea yes and believe what you have said yes you can have what you will amen amen amen now do what is faith faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen right when we are speaking now we need to speak what we believe will happen and not what we are seeing amen amen let me show you now how we are in the image and likeness of God Genesis 1 God is seeing a dark World a void world right Darkness over the face of the Jeep he's seeing Darkness all around does he speak what he sees does he speak oh look at the world it's so dark does he speak look at my problem does he speak what he wants to see yes he speaks let there be light amen amen thank you Lord now why am I saying this we are now what is the third pool all about speaking yes I'm afraid too many people think it yes too many people think uh I believe that in their minds but they never confess it yeah I find that to be a problem in the church as well yes yes you know what even after the word is being preached I found this and I found this when I'm doing Diagnostics because many times after the word is being preached Faith drops in the hearts of the people but they never speak their faith what happens after the service the minister prays for you you never confess nothing did you notice that how many of you got a need yeah you're raising your hand now the minister is offering prayer for you but who must say you must save you does it take the minister says does it save the pastor praise do you know that all you and I both of us are Brothers and Sisters in Christ and that the same power and anointing has given me through the power of the Holy Ghost he has given you yeah it's just that people are not taught the right way and they're taught to look upon a priest and a pastor and this high and mighty man yeah and you always need to go to him but the same access he has given the ministry has given to you that if you say to this mountain if you speak to a situation amen hallelujah now there is no sickness no circumstance should be able to stand in our way and God is putting us through training grounds right now amen amen thank you yes you need to take control of your situation amen you need to speak to your situation God is training you amen he's bringing you into his image and after his likeness yeah don't speak what you are seeing speak faith over your situation amen God saw your Dark Void yeah Darkness over the face of the deep and he said let there be light amen don't let it remain in your thoughts now because prior to that everything was in God's thoughts amen it was in the back part of his mind but he had to speak his thoughts amen he had to express his thoughts now we are not mutant dumb and that's where Satan comes in now he keeps the church Beauty and dumb he keeps the church not confessing what they believe amen hallelujah that's why he oppresses you that you can't say Amen to the word because amen saying I believe that word amen is saying I confess that I believe it so he keeps you mutant he keeps you dumb therefore people can't have the victory amen amen hallelujah don't let don't be a tool for the enemy don't be a true for Satan say Satan you are trying to keep my mouth closed but I'm gonna shot an amen I'm gonna agree with the word of God Amen the word of God is coming to fill me up amen is this time in the season amen thank you amen hallelujah he has given the Heavens to who control to me God himself amen amen but he says man has control over the Earth not just anyone there must be children that's the ones who are receiving inheritance didn't we just read that in Ephesians amen amen let's turn to Joshua chapter one Hallelujah talking about inheritance now remember Joshua parallels Ephesians halleluia can you say Amen to that the Book of Joshua it's the land of his The Inheritance and Ephesians is the land of our inheritance amen hallelujah let's watch how the Lord is instructing Joshua here and we'll see what value now why am I saying this I need us all to go back and start reading the Bible and obtaining the promises of God yes amen mark down the promises of God but down the word of God and start to personalize it in your life amen Hallelujah glory be to his name let's see here now thank you right so I just want to read the whole thing but I need to amen limit myself here you're going to read the chapter one amen when you get home let's read from verse 5. they shall not any man now bear in mind when you're reading this this is before the New Covenant and in this before the New Covenant can be so powerful how much more after the new cup after the New Covenant after Christ's sacrifice after we know who we are in Christ amen amen after we have received an inheritance watch now there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee Norful safety amen didn't Jesus say hello I'm with you always amen Hallelujah be strong and have a good courage For unto these people shall thou divide for inheritance the land amen which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be that strong and very courageous that thou May is observe to do according to all the law which Moses my seven commanded thee turn not from me to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with this however thou goes now watch the God say I'm going to prosper you read carefully now before you answer is his ability to prosper link to something read carefully turn not from me to the right hand or the left what he must return not from the word of God the law right now remember if the law of being a type and a shadow of the New Covenant how much more the word of God in the New Testament amen amen if you don't turn from the word of God listen read carefully turn not from it to the right or the left that thou mayest Prosper whether so ever thou goest right not only that now this book of the law shall not depart out of thy are we coming back to speaking yes this word of God must not depart from your heart from your mind from where mouth amen mouth where did John have to put the book amen he had to put it in his mouth I am telling you you're going to see tremendous victories in the Supernatural if you start to speak the word don't think the word amen the Bible says your thoughts are loud in heaven the Lord knows the word amen the Lord knows the word so you thinking the word your thoughts are loud in heaven hey you're thinking hey I'm so great I'm just thinking of meditating on the word of God day and night hurt responds when you speak you were giving dominion and God did not make Adam mute the three could not did Jesus say to the wind Earth is man's inheritance you were given dominion over there you need to speak and believe what you have said amen hallelujah amen now I'm taking you back and I'm breaking it down because that's the inheritance and the richness of the opening of the world come to put man back in our position yes sir you'll find a lot of time we focus on the mystery itself am I right once you use refocusing and be so mystified by the Mysteries that we can't put it into practice yes yes all of that came for a reason for a purpose yeah put me back in my original condition that's right amen amen hallelujah amen let's continue reading the book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth so which means is meaning for you to speak it but Thou shalt meditate day in day and night that thou mayest observe so how are you going to know the word of God by reading it that's why the meditating comes you read the word you group yourself with the word so the time of need you can speak the word right that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written then okay where am I now I'm in verse 8 right yes for them Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success good success and prosperity only lies in the word of God amen only lies in the word of God now if keeping the law could be so powerful and now if you know that just one wrong thought condemn them under the law they broke one thing they saw this beautiful woman passing and they lusted after or they coveted this person's wife or they did something and it condemned them yes now we have one sacrifice the blood of Jesus Christ right so prosperity and success lies in you keeping the word amen amen amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen many many men Hallelujah now we find here that Abraham Abram was passing and you'll find the blessings it's only in chapter 17 that he has a name change so I'm from 12 chapter 12 to verse 17 he is experiencing many things in his life and every step of the way to his inheritance to receiving what God had promised to him well I'm putting it this way because you are on journey to your full inheritance your final inheritance will be the body change amen oh my the brothers were so engrossed in the word that they forgot to put the generation on amen praise the Lord that's a good sign that amen glory be to his name let's give them a minute to amen put that on let the Whigs say I am strong and let the poor say I am rich and let the blind save I can see it's What the Lord Has Done For Me let the we say I am strong and let the poor say I am rich let the blind say I can see it's What the Lord Has Done For Me you see why I love that song it turns every negative thing to a positive it turns every bad situation to a good situation amen hallelujah now God is just planned certain things in our lives God allows you to go to trials God allows you to go to situations and many times now that we are looking back we have missed opportunities to take control over a situation because we didn't know how to operate in our sonship Authority we experience many trials many griefs many Sorrows many attics because we didn't know how to operate in our friendship Authority but God is taking away all the Amnesia amen God is stripping in a way yes amen let me tell you something about this this King's son who was a slave amen you know how many times the prophet will refer to the slave the King's son yeah amen he was the center for King and he was here on this Farm on this Ranch amen and he was laboring away because he was a slave but when they came to buy him it wasn't for sale and they found out amen they began to question the owner of the Iran shall ask him why is he different from the rest of the slaves do you treat him different do you feed him different is he given special is he the master is he the Lord or maybe the the oversee of all the other slaves he says no he's just the same as them amen why doesn't he have marks on his body why is he walking in Perfection here because he knows who his father is yes [Music] now let me tell you something they didn't have to wake up every morning and go to this guy and tell him your father is a king is there so he has to label so much to tell you that the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ you are Sons and Daughters of God week after week they must come and tell you do we have are you so old that you got dementia that you got amnesia that you keep forgetting who you are from one service to the next you've forgotten in fact from today till tomorrow the night sleep will get you and you'll wake up and you you forgot everything that was spoken and the first problem come you speak the negative sometimes it's not even the way we speak it's in our actions it's in our attitude to that it's in our moons and our groans it's showing our unbelief and it's showing the negativity amen but we are building up Faith people amen a faith civilization amen hallelujah we got to remind ourselves who we are remind yourself amen until he becomes so that you know who you are in Christ you know what Christ has made you to be when Satan brings condemnation and fear and say you're nothing but a sinner look at your Falls look at your trials tell him about the blood of Jesus and how Jesus made a way for you and you are covered by the blood and you are forgiven and you are cleansed and you are sinless you are the Spotless white Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ you are son and daughter amen I'm not my own I'm watching the price I'm a holy ghost still son and daughter no matter what Satan tells you you speak God's word back to him amen I don't care how that symptom is Raging I don't care if cancer is waging in your body you speak to that demon amen and you say I speak to the root of cancer and I curse you like Jesus Christ of victory oh yes speak the word tell him Satan you met my brother once the Bible calls us the brother of Jesus Amen [Music] [Music] [Music] amen thank you amen amen amen if you know anything about that fig tree fig tree is known normally bear leaves amen if it's not bearing fruit but this victory was boasting amen it was full of leaves the Bible says Jesus looked from above and he came to the tree looking that he might find figs on it amen put up Mark 11 there and the Bible says that Jesus answered the tree did you read that she was speaking to Jesus you didn't see that they put mark 11. amen amen the tree was questioning Jesus this book is a very mysterious book chapter yeah yeah because here's the king coming in Mark 11 he's writing the quote he's coming as king yeah yeah the undertaking palm branches come on now be spiritual if you haven't caught the revelation of the chapter you need to read or a spiritual understanding he is coming now and he tells them loose the coat yeah they take garments spread it on the ground yeah they are saying blessed is he they are Hail to the King coming should a king have dominion should a king have authority and that's why it's found in this chapter amen let's go right and seeing a fig tree or far of having leads he came if aptly might find anything there and when he came to him he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus answered how many of you answer something if you don't get asked a question and Jesus answered and said unto it the tree was questioning Jesus if Jesus comes to your tree will you find fruit amen amen is this not the nature of Our Lord if you go and read the parable where Jesus is talking about the he gave them uh what did he give them money one hit it in the ground once he says don't you know that I reap where Heaven so yeah go read that story he says you should at least put it in modern terms of bands so they will collect interest but you did nothing with it what am I talking about the word of God I've given you the word of God but you did nothing with it you don't speak the word of God you didn't practice the word of God you didn't exercise the word of God Amen you did nothing with it you just content that's right that everything is done but you forget fail to see the ultimate goal is that this you must become the Living Word how do you become the Living Word if you don't speak the word yes you've got to mix your faith with the word that's when it becomes powerful it releases power there's so many quotes I can show you brother Brandon says there's nothing more powerful than the word of God Amen doesn't the Bible says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words will never fail so why don't we speak the word of God Amen amen instead of speaking negativity instead of speaking fear yeah look at what happened to job speaking fear oh let me just go offer this prayer just in case my children sin I think they might be sinning now he was focused on the problem the Bible says the prophet says that his faith would have brought him out of it but his fear brought him to it ask yourself the situations you faced in your life the situations you are facing now is it not because you may be spoke it is it not because of your fear you're constant happy about it yeah amen we know the most common thing is sickness most people relate to that because his body is subject to sickness but you know that even sickness must obey you amen amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen my wife was telling me yesterday about a friend Australia is probably a young child and they were staying in a rural part of PE or something and uh baby was telling the child was turning blue the rushed to the doctor the doctor just took a look at the child and says you need to take this child to the hospital immediately so they go to the hospital they they look at the child and they say you know what our hospital is too small here in this rural place you need to go to the big cities and take this child immediately but not telling the mother what's wrong when they finally go there they uh do they test and they tell the mother this boy is leukemia now if you receive what is leukemia they can't see in the blood yeah okay if you see if you're receiving news like that about your child how would you react be honest what is your first thing most people will say will phone their friends families wherever and say my child is Leukemia my child is leukemia you speak what you see yes you will speak the doctor's report and that's where the enemy clutches now grabs a hole they have accepted me amen I believe the mother didn't accept it she didn't even respond to the doctor she just said okay she went on to a group so whatever told everyone to start praying told everyone to start praying whoever she could and they started their faith and believe when she went back to the doctor I don't know if it was the next day or what the doctor is saying we don't know what happened but we can't find a trace of this thing anymore it's completely gone now why were we telling you this you are going to experience things yeah yes I want the word of God to come back to your memory amen amen now he can move past healing and just normal situations somebody come to upset your spirit you're the Son and Daughter of God yeah but they want to now draw you into their atmosphere your boss at work suddenly starts swearing at you

he was mowing the lawn now watch he has a prophet he could speak to the Beast of the field is he back in Adam's condition you speak to the Flying bees amen he could speak to the storm he could speak the tumor out of sister amida he could change atmospheres by putting on an apron and washing the dishes amen be a master of all circumstances amen and what Satan will try and he'll cut you off you

that you'll be faithful people amen that you'll be a master of all circumstances amen amen that's what we're heading to right now yes yes amen hallelujah because that body Chains would require a perfect Faith yes amen amen hallelujah in order for Faith to be perfected it must be tried did you hear what I said in order for your faith to be perfected it must be tried yes anything must go through rigorous testing and trials yes before the finished product thank you so you are in the training ground right now amen Hallelujah so exercise your faith over every circumstance amen and don't back down because the word of God will not return void yes something uh I'm going to re-emphasize this so sometimes we pray too many long prayers of Our Own we say lots of words we say lots of words when we don't need all we need to do is say back the word let me give you an example for healing let's turn to one Peter chapter two amen glory be to his name amen we're going to finish now and start praying amen hallelujah amen okay let's read from verse 21. for even here until where you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example so who's our example that you should know that you should follow in his steps amen what do you saying we must follow in his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth so I'll be following there now we must our sin was buried taken on the cross right neither was God found in our mouths who when he was reviled reviled not again so watch now people are going to come and rev you up you revile not again when he suffered he threatened not how many of us threatened people but committed himself to him the judges righteously amen so when somebody is coming against you committed to the Lord Lord I'm committing this to you here's where I want to get to now verse 24 remember this verse recite it memorize it it's important or his own self be our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes you are going to be healed by whose tribes you were here now quick English lesson here is were we got a teacher here tuna is were a present tense a past tense or a future tense everyone's looking for the teacher to answer them is were a future tense present tense or a past year everybody agrees it's a past tense when did he bear the stripes how many years ago so you were healed 2023 years ago you say right because that's when he bore the stripes physically on his back how many of you think those stripes are still open those wounds are still open Jesus walking around with open wounds when he resurrected didn't he resurrect in a glorified body amen so all the wounds on his back were healed yeah so now learn a simple thing don't go pray endless prayers I thank you Jesus when you're sick I thank you Jesus that you took my sin on the cross use the scripture just use the word of God back I thank you Jesus that you bore my sin on the cross now thank you Lord that I am resurrected in your righteousness amen thank you by your stripes amen thank you amen pray back the wood pray back the word didn't the prophet say hey give us the other type amen that scripture is taken from Isaiah 53 whose Stripes you were healed let me say one time this boy says he was talking to this man and this man says he was telling him I want to pray the way my mother used to pray then he says okay pray for me the way your mother is to pray and then he says he was wounded for Ramesh my beers sickness he was bruised for Ramesh Mavis iniquities the chastisement of Ramesh
