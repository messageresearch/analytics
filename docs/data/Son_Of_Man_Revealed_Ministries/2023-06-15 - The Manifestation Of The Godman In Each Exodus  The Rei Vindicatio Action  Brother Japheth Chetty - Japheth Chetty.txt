say that something's wrong with us we need to get to that amen that's what the message was all about to bring us into his image and his likeness amen do you know there's many accounts of this and you'll find that some have gone into the extreme of it that when they looked at the life and the ministry of William Branham they were baffled and they mistook him for Jesus now anyone who's preaching

at different stages and maybe different levels of Faith but when we come together we put our licks of fire together amen we can make one big Holy Ghost Fire amen amen so amen let's just have come with the right attitude tonight let's have our hearts focused on him our thoughts focused on him I know some of us come from work and we tired from the day but amen the Lord can strengthen Us in his presence amen let's just turn to the word of God Exodus chapter 6 to start from verse 28. [Music] and it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt that the Lord spake unto Moses saying I am the Lord speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee and Moses said before the Lord behold I am a uncircumcised lips and how shall fear or harken unto me and the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a God to Pharaoh amen and here and thy brother shall be thy prophet amen you 've got a blessings to the reading of the word amen so I don't have to prepare a foundation today because the foundation has been laid all these weeks amen we know we are constantly talking about what's happening in the season amen so none of us are in the dark of what's Happening amen what the Lord is doing this year amen because we've been experiencing it in our own lives yes amen so it's not just God working with one person but amen God working with each individual amen it might be in different spheres of your life amen some may be in a spiritual sense some may be in their natural life amen but God is concerned with all the things amen sometimes we tend to only want to apply the things of God to the kingdom of God Amen but Jesus said the kingdom of God is within you yes so amen even your natural life is part of the kingdom of God Amen so amen we can see God working and be thankful for that amen and we pray that you'll strengthen us tonight yes amen so I only got notice of preaching today at around midday five o'clock hey man so I didn't have much time to prepare a sermon but amen but thank God the days of sermons are over amen the Holy Spirit can still give us inspiration amen so we pray that he will drop down this evening and speak to us yes so we know we've been here in the last few weeks that amen we are Gods on the earth amen Adam was made to be a God on the earth amen we know that great God Almighty he was the god of the heavens and he made his son Adam to be a god of the earth amen so for a title tonight I just want to talk on the manifestation of the god man in each exodus yes yes amen and because I'm a lawyer I'm gonna add a legal subject and we're gonna say it's the ravindikachu action now some of you might not understand what that is but I'm going to explain that to you I'm going to give you a low 101 today amen hallelujah amen hallelujah so God says to Moses amen Moses is going now to face pharaoh and now remember that at that time Egypt is this great superpower amen they were the Great superpower of the world and actually in those days the Pharaoh was looked at as a god amen and the Pharaohs in those days weren't just like just ordinary Kings they were looked at as God beings very mythical and very Spiritual Beings and they worshiped their Pharaoh amen yes it wasn't like the kings that we have today so here we have a superpower amen that's controlling the world and we have a man that supposedly a God but God says unto Moses now Moses being the real God man God says unto Moses I made you a god unto Pharaoh amen what the world has said is they God amen what Satan has said is he's man in that hour as a God God is not saying I have made you Amen in this great age amen and Moses now looking at Moses we know the life of Moses Moses grew up under this household yes under the household of pharaoh he was trained under the house of pharaoh but little did Pharaoh know that in his own household was a God man being raised up amen amen amen to defeat the works of Satan yes amen now if we look at verse chapter 6 verse 30 we'll see that Moses has sort of this inferiority complex and Moses says he says the Lord behold I'm of uncircumcised lips yes and how shall I how shall Pharaoh can unto me so even Moses started to look at his own thoughts now amen so Moses started to see that he was not good enough amen he said everything no but you know I did this in my past yeah amen how is God going to use me when I did this in my past it can't be that God can use me when I did such a thing yes amen you know some of us are excellent swimmers because God says he threw our sins in a sea of forgetfulness but some of us want to swim right down amen excellent swimmers but amen you remember the story about the prophet uh the prophet saying that there was one time this daughter told her dad to stay up in the attic because he makes too much of noise amen and he found in the geography book that he could not find the bottom of the ocean amen so I want to tell you tonight that no matter how good of a swimmer you are you're not going to reach the bottom amen swim down that ocean you're not going to see any of my sins this complex that he had and so in the next verse God says unto Moses and the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a God to Pharaoh amen don't talk to me about you being of uncircumcised lips don't talk to me about your past thank you amen God designed it this way did he not design Adam to be that way amen did he not put Adam in that condition to rule over the Earth yeah amen it was God's purpose and when God made man he said it was good amen amen because God had a purpose in his heart amen hallelujah so Moses amen had to get over this inferiority complex yeah amen and I want to encourage you to not stop looking at ourselves amen look at ourselves the way God looks right now Moses tried to look at himself the way he saw himself amen but God said now look at the way I see it amen I see you as a god amen amen and then Moses now when Moses starts to realize who he is we know what happens the name and he goes down to Egypt and he absolutely torments Pharaoh amen he torments Egypt amen he torments The Works of pharaoh amen the ten plagues amen and we know we can see Moses coming into this god statue where he starts to speak flies into existence amen he starts to speak frogs into existence amen so much so the Pharaoh began to get sick of him amen and sometimes the devil needs to become so sick of us amen amen if the devil is not sick of us there's a problem amen it means he's fine because we are not attacking him amen but Moses amen the prophets that he went on as a one-man Invasion amen and he began to attack Egypt amen that great superpower of that day amen those demon powers that were held up amen at that time Moses began to torment them amen amen and why because Satan amen thought he had a man there that he backed up this man Pharaoh amen but Moses was backed up by God amen by the same power amen and Rose Jesus from the dead because he said it's the same power that Rose Jesus from the dead dwells in us it will Quicken this Mortal body amen amen like the prophet talked about the policeman amen he might be of a small statue standing there at the traffic sign amen and no matter how big that truck coming down the road is amen when they see the policeman put up his hand they have to stop amen amen because that policeman is backed by the law of the land amen and we are back to amen by the law of God and the power of God Amen by the supernatural we are backed by the angels of God Amen because he said I will give my angels charge over thee amen so we know that the angel of the Lord goes before us amen amen we are backed people amen so when we speak we should not be afraid amen we should speak with authority amen because we have the backing of the Holy Ghost amen thank you Hallelujah amen now Moses you know Moses began to do all of these great things and he began to exercise his faith I began to speak all of these things all of these things but even Moses came to a stage where when they were come to the Red Sea and he was perplexed now because all of the people was crying unto Moses Moses he brought us here to Die Why didn't Jesus not leave us in Egypt the amen so Moses began to get perplexed and he began to forget about the power of God Amen so Moses starts to cry out to God Amen to make a way because they were stuck at the Red Sea amen When God Says unto Moses why are you crying amen speak and go forward amen because Moses had already been commissioned God was not going to come down and commission him again amen he already commissioned him the first time amen so Moses had the backings to speak and go forward amen so that is where we need to come to now amen we don't have to wait now for an audible voice of God to speak to us you've been hearing that these last few weeks amen we heard the the other week I mean how our Prophet amen came to a stage in his life where he began to lose the compassion for the people and he wanted to go up into the mountains and God told him that you are called for a much greater accordance amen God told him why are you waiting for me to tell you when to go or what to do amen he had already been commissioned to the angels not meet him in the cave and commissioning amen he said if you get the people to believe you nothing will stand in your way yes amen amen so Moses came to the same place am and let us not come to that place where we say no we are waiting amen where we say no the bride is that say the Lord oh she keeps there the bride has thus saved the Lord we've already been commissioned amen Mark 11 23 amen says speak amen we don't have to wait amen you went to trials in your life you come into your Red Sea don't try out to God speak and go forward it doesn't matter what the trial is I'm pretty sure that trial is not greater than the Red Sea amen I'm pretty sure it's not greater than those Seas coming up as walls amen hallelujah amen amen but speak and go forward amen we have already been commissioned they're not the prophecy come over the church this year commissioning us and saying that this will be the most Supernatural year for the church amen did not the word of the Lord come to say that it's now the season for Mark 11 28. yes amen so if they need for us to wait no amen we are speaking amen amen let me show you our exercises no matter what is even if it's baby steps amen you are speaking over every situation when you wake up in the morning amen and you're praying you're on your way to work say Lord I'm speaking a positive day amen Lord I'm speaking safety over my family amen Lord I'm speaking Prosperity over myself Lord I'm speaking good health over my family amen you're not trained amen you are confessing it amen we heard the other week that he is the high priest about confession amen so whatever we confess amen confess amen positive things amen confess the things that God desires for us amen he said amen I wish above all things that dumb is prosper and be in good house amen hallelujah now that is that say the Lord amen hallelujah um amen so Moses did not have to wait for a vision amen he didn't have to wait for an audible voice he just had to speak and go forward amen amen hallelujah we see that this was the first Exodus amen remember we speaking about the manifestation of the god man in each Exodus we know there were three Exodus amen but just looking at the first Exodus amen being the Genesis amen being the first Exodus we see that first Moses had to come up into the statue where he was a God man amen he is a God to pharaoh but not only that that same Ministry then produced people who would be Gods on the earth yeah that same Ministry produced a Joshua amen and Joshua was like a god who could say to the sun sun stand still amen hallelujah amen God had set the sun in motion amen when God created the Earth amen he wrote the laws in place of how this should stay this planet should stay here the sun should stay yeah the Earth should rotate amen how many days the Earth should rotate God wrote the laws of physics the laws of gravity and all of these laws but here comes a man now who rewrites those laws of physics he says amen now I know that almighty God created you I know that God sets you in place to move at a certain point amen I know that these laws are in place but the very same God that created you created me amen hallelujah and the same God created Adam to be a god of the earth amen I am a son of Adam just for a few moments amen I'm asking you to stand still until I say so amen that is Joshua coming to be a God Amen God hallelujah amen he began to rewrite the laws of physics amen hallelujah amen can you imagine what audacity that is Amen to say you know what God created the son to be in that way but now you as the Son of God is commanding the son to do something contrary to what God commands amen yet it is in the will of God Amen Hallelujah is that contrary to the will of God amen amen amen hallelujah thank you amen you know signs have been studying the laws of physics and the laws of science for thousands of years now amen but we had forefathers thousands of years ago they were stopped in the sun they were Defying Gravity yeah amen they would define the laws of physics amen you don't believe me if you look at Samson amen yeah the prophet said you know when the church will preach about Samson or when they draw a picture and they draw this big picture of a man with great big muscles but the prophet said he was a Little Mommy's boy amen with little locks on his ear like a little amen that's what the prophet said so how was Samson able to take the gates amen and carry the heavy gate with all of those Philistines on him on the gate how is he able to do that the laws of physique does not permit that yeah amen the law of the way of physics tells you that there's a certain weight that goes with a certain load and you can only handle a certain load amen but Samson begin to rewrite the laws of physics amen amen amen if you remember the story of I think it was Elisha and there was someone that had lost this tool in in the lake amen and Elijah Elijah then goes and he drops something in the leg and that thing begins to swim back up [Music] here you begin to rewrite the laws of how things work when something is dropped in the ocean and it sinks amen there's nothing that can make it sing back uh come back up like that amen but he began to rewrite the laws amen have you been here in amen how Esther was instructed to rewrite the laws amen amen and we amen today I instructed Amen to write your own laws amen amen speak amen speak and go forward amen and Esther amen when she wrote the law rewrote the laws she preserved our own people amen amen now how many of you have families that are unsaved amen how many of you have families that are not in the message amen now I'm asking you like Esther to rewrite the laws amen that can preserve your own people amen amen she preserved the people amen she was preserved for such a time as that amen the preservation of life amen and you are preserved for this end time there's going to be a people that will be able to claim their loved ones under the token amen there's going to People Gear people that's not going to accept the enemy getting a hold of their families amen there's gonna be a people that's not going to accept their children being lost amen right who said the right thing amen and a super anointing and the prophet began to exercise the third pole and says whatever you want now amen amen hallelujah and she asks for the Salvation of her two boys amen so you can have the salvation of your children amen you can have the salvation of your loved ones amen just rewrite the laws amen amen be a God man on the earth amen amen hallelujah king Hezekiah amen there was a prophecy going forth a decree amen that you only have a certain amount of time left to live amen it was thus said the Lord and we know that when it does say the Lord it must come to pass Hallelujah but Hezekiah began to change the circumstances amen he began to change the atmosphere amen so much so that the prophet had to come back and be right his own prophecy amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah can we have a people amen that will not accept defeat yes amen can we have a people like sister Ruth amen when they Proclaim there's a heart problem you don't accept it amen no matter what they what the Emmy throws that I say man we will not accept him Hallelujah amen let's get back to Authority amen the God man in the first Exodus and his ministry produced The God people amen like Joshua amen that we come to the second Exodus amen and we know at the second Exodus we didn't we had the God man amen that came on the scene Hallelujah amen amen and Jesus was the god man amen and once again it was a time of this great superpower on the earth the room the Roman Empire yes amen and once again the emperor of Rome was looked at this God figure amen they feared him amen they treated him like this great God Amen we know that it was that same Roman system that we have today amen but back then it was this great Empire and Satan had his great God figure on the Earth but here amen comes the God man walking on the earth amen yes amen hallelujah come down Amen to pay a price for his future bride amen you're gonna come upon the scene yes yes amen he comes to later on his life and he come to show us that he was amen that amen that we that that lived there was a bin the wave chief that was being waved amen and come to show us how amen that he was the second Adam Amen to come into that image amen that God image amen and yes he comes to Pontius Pilate amen he comes before Pontius Pilate and he says to Pontius pilot no man taking my life away amen this great God man he says I have the power to lay down and raise it back up again amen no man could say that before but here comes the God man and he says I have the power to raise my life again amen and you can speak with such confidence not even the winds and the Seas obey him amen and remember we know that Jesus was God right yes but when he was on the Earth he was still a man so even though he was God he was still man this Plains was that we can come to that same image amen it wasn't as okay no Jesus was God so that is why Jesus could do that no he didn't come as a spirit being he came as a flesh man amen amen that is why when he came to the Fig Tree and when he is hungry in the flesh and he cursed the Fig Tree amen amen amen there might be things in your life amen we've once again we just revising amen we just refresh in our memory we've been hearing this all these weeks amen you face trials amen yes amen that trial that Jesus face yes hungry it was a physical literal trial it was not something spiritual nothing to do with the spirit amen so in your face your physical circumstances amen be like Jesus amen be like the God man amen amen speak into that circumstance amen Speak Life into that circumstance amen amen if there's if there's something negative in your life curse that thing amen like Jesus cursed the tree bind it amen amen he showed us the example amen of how we should walk upon the Earth amen he was shown as the example of how you should come into that image amen showing us how Adam was Amen in the beginning amen now you know when the the Pharisees always criticizing Jesus what was the real reason that they were really angry about uh Angry with him for amen the real reason that angered them is they said you being a man make yourself God amen amen that was the tracks of it yeah amen if he was just like for example he was just a preacher or something they would have not worried so much but he said you being a man make yourself God Amen and you would notice that whenever the ministry comes to a stage where people have to come to realization that they are God upon the Earth yes you will watch that that same spirit is there to attack him yes amen what was the main challenge last year and the previous the years just prior to this year prior to this year where the commission came forth and where we are learning now that we have to be Godzilla amen the biggest attack came on the Firefall Ministry because they started to say stay at home play the tapes you don't need the Firefall Ministry why because there was coming a time when the Firefall Ministry whose purpose is to edify the bride was to awaken the bread to their position and you are to be Gods upon the Earth amen amen Satan was not gonna be happy about that so he tried to silence the voice amen amen he tried to attack that amen but here we are today amen amen the work of God Amen man cannot be defeated amen amen Satan cannot stop the things of God how angry he wants to get amen even in the time of the first Exodus amen Pharaoh got so angry amen because Moses was like a God now to him amen he began to do all of these things so much so that Pharaoh began to you know curse Moses and say all of these things till he pronounced his own son's death amen when he started a curse Moses pronounced his own son his own son's death and he got so angry that he even chased Moses into the ocean bed with his Great Walls of water standing he was so mad at Moses that he even chased Moses right there yeah amen not realizing he is walking into his own grave amen the same in the time of Jesus they were still so angry that they began to crucify him amen they begin to reject him amen amen so the same today amen Satan gets angry amen when we want to come to our position when God wants to tell us that you need to come up higher when God wants to tell us that there's more for us amen than just receiving the word and being happy with that amen God wants to show us amen that the whole purpose of this amen the third foreign minister part of the threefold purpose amen was that God was restoring title deep God was restoring us back to academic condition amen amen but Satan gets angry when he hears these things and then he wants to attack the move of God Amen but we are not unaware of his schemes Hallelujah and God raises up a standard yeah it is why you notice how the word started to come in such a vigorous form Amen to attack that amen because God raises up a standard amen standard is the word of God amen hallelujah amen glory amen isn't he great amen isn't he worthy yeah Hallelujah hmm so yeah so they begin to get angry at Jesus because he they said you're making yourself God and what did Jesus say to them then he said if you don't believe me that I am he hey amen if you don't believe that I am the god man walking on the earth to leave the works because the works testify of who I am if you want to believe my confession I am a God man in this age amen believe the works that are following amen but now we can't say that if the works are not foreign for many years amen the messy church has had the profession amen but the works were not following but this year Hallelujah oh yeah these signs will follow he says amen hallelujah so now we can say to this age amen that if you do not believe that we are the ones Amen to bring forth the promised word in this hour and to manifest The Life of Christ in this hour yeah believe the works amen amen hallelujah thank you oh glory be to God Amen this second Exodus amen the God man walking upon the Earth but like the first Exodus this ministry now also produced a people that will become like Gods the second Exodus amen amen because then come men like pizza and Paul amen amen there come a time amen when a snake bit Paul amen amen and he began to just amen shut it off and throw it in the fire amen and the people begin to look at him and first when they saw the snake bison they thought this man is cursed perhaps he did something evil amen but when he just Shrugged it off amen then he said this man must be a God Amen they begin to see that there's something different about this man amen amen Pizza amen when he is walking and he says Sylvan Gold Have I None yes yes amen but such as I have I give unto thee amen come into His image of being a God on the earth amen and to rewrite the laws of what govern the sickness in that manner amen amen he begins to rewrite the biology in that man amen hallelujah Paul began even to rewrite their biology in his own body amen because biology tells you that when venomous snakes bite you you are going to die yeah amen but Paul begins to rewrite him amen amen law of biology in his own body amen and if he could do that amen you can do that today amen you don't have to accept sickness amen you can rewrite the law of biology [Applause] it doesn't matter what the symptoms are yes it doesn't matter if the doctor say that this symptom amen shows you that you have cancer yeah amen it doesn't matter if the doctor says that there's a tumor there in the body whatever the biology says amen you can rewrite amen hallelujah we don't have to accept it amen amen Prophet said he said and come to you in a bag of rattlesnakes throw it back at him hey man we don't have to accept it yeah yes you might see the rattlesnakes you might see the symptoms but don't accept it amen hallelujah amen amen when he when he when he said to that man Sylvan gold have I done he didn't have to see a vision yeah he didn't wait for the audible voice of God he didn't say let me go back and fast and pray about this amen but he began to speak amen and notice what he said he said such as I have amen I give unto you amen he didn't say such as what God has is going to give us him he said such as I have amen but you got to know what you got amen you got to know that you are backed up yeah you got to know that your tank is full amen he's gonna have confidence in what you speak amen hallelujah through the second Exodus and now we come to the Third Exodus amen amen amen I'm trying to speed up amen because we're going to get into a time of prayer amen so we come to the Third Exodus and God sends one now notice in the first Exodus you had Moses right and in the second Exodus you had Jesus amen but now God sends one in the Third Exodus he said as I was with Moses I would be with you yes and then also further to that in the days when the son of man is revealed Jesus Christ Ministry being revealed in the same person Moses Ministry and Jesus ministry being revealed in the same person a God man walking upon the Earth demon he was able to say to the fish amen little fishy I give you back your life amen amen he is able to see the sister how do you write amen I give you the salvation of your two boys amen hallelujah and showing us an example in this day of what we need to come to now the prophet also you know many times operated by vision and what he would see the father doing amen and we know that when he spoke the squirrels into existence and he spoke to the fish God instructed him to do those things but that was only because God was teaching him how the third poor works yeah God was showing him how this works amen because for years the prophet said he did not understand Mark 11 23 yes yes amen and he doesn't want to preach on it because he didn't understand it amen and so we see God was teaching the prophet and how to operate in this and that is why God instructed him speak to the schools speak to the speak to the fish now that does not mean now that we have to wait each time for the audible voice of God to instruct us speak to this speak to them God was teaching him so that God so that he could show us yes how to operate that power amen amen amen amen so sometimes we can take the flips out of that and say okay no we have to wait for God to speak but he's already commissioned us yes yes Mark 11 3 if you say Amen so don't confuse the tuna and think that we have to wait now for an audible voice of God Amen he is already commissioned that amen now I'll give you an example of that and just to talk about this example I just want to go through this quote and maybe if we can put it up so it's quite a long quote but I want to go through it just in bits and pieces because I think the prophet teaches us a good lesson here on how to operate Amen in this Supernatural and in the level of Faith amen but I want and I want you to pay special attention to the fact that this is from the message faith is the substance yes which is the first recorded message so the prophet is laying a foundation remember the prophet was instructed to record the messages spiritual food in due season amen so in the very first message I want you to see what Foundation the prophet is laying and I wanted you to see that even though the prophet says for years he did not understand Mark 11 23 but I want you to understand that he was already operating it it might not have understood it but he has already operating in it amen so let's go maybe you can type out I have faith to believe anything amen amen you love the Lord amen amen paragraph 35. this is a little bit up higher okay let's start from the last um sentence there properties and I'll see if you've got faith so the prophet here is testing whether the sister has Faith now sister you do not you do not have faith so the sister the prophet went to pray for the sick sister and the prophet asked if she believes that she said yes she has faith to be healed and the prophet Discerning I said you do not have faith amen so she said oh Reverend Brennan I have faith to believe anything now doesn't that sound like us message people all over these years amen amen we have we have the word we believe anything we believe that the Lord can do anything and she says oh brother Brandon I have faith to believe anything and he says if you have faith and the prophet says the faith he said if you have faith I want to ask you and show you rather that you do not have faith now listen and catch every word of it amen now in the prophet we know when the prophet says listen amen he's going to teach us something amen and he says catch every word of it hanging in the room from there was this chandelier with a string and at the end of the string was a little bracelet name and you all know the story I mean it was a white bracelet and the little red sets a man let's go a little bit down you know what that is 36 and I've seen that little bracelet hanging down I said to the young lady how far are you away from the bracelet and she said approximately 15 feet I said now the prophet asked the adults to turn their backs because the next paragraph and that's the reason I'm getting into these things with you tonight we've got two more nights and something's got to be done amen the prophet realizes there's something missing everyone so he's teaching them a principle yeah he says see you see now I don't want you to go away and say anything wrong about this because you might have to answer the Judgment for it and so I said something has to be done immediately now your parents just turn your back and some of the neighbors who are sitting up here MLS just got a little bit more down just before paragraph 37 and she said about three days said I can't even keep water in my stomach and you know what attendeecee Associated appendix problem paragraph 37. and I said now if you believe with all your heart and you prove to me now that you've got faith look directly at that bracelet and hit hang in the inward air and you make the bracelet swing around in the room and then you make it swing back and forth in the room and stop it and I'll believe you have faith now let's just stop there hey man how the prophet takes something very literal he doesn't take something spiritual he takes something very literal and he says if you say you have faith I want you to move this bracelet without even touching it now that test would choke most of us message people yes amen that would definitely choke most of us message people and I pray that the Lord amen brings us up to that state state that the prophet was in that could exercise in such a fate like that amen amen but let's see what the prophet teaches us she said Oh Brother Branham said why ask me something like that I said I wanted this and the prophet said I said I want you to see if you have faith I said Jesus said all things are possible if you believe now that's the prophecy that's pure Faith amen and here the prophet says even magicians use it many times to play pranks and so forth burst glasses and things and you wonder how they are doing these things the prophet says they are applying the same law of Faith they are believing it's going to happen and it happens amen and this is from the prophet now amen I want you to sit still now so you'll catch this wake yourself up amen so when I get through with it you know what it's all about then she said why brother Graham no one could do that I said oh yes anyone can that believes and he said well I don't believe that anyone could do that so the prophet says but I thought you said you believed for all things see how she was caught right there and some of us can get caught right there amen when it comes to circumstances in our life everything you know this is just something literature that's going on in our life but amen apply your faith amen amen and she said I don't believe there's anyone that can do that that's much here now look at the word she says that's material brother Brandon like Jesus cursing the Fig Tree material I said yes ma'am she said well I can see it done and the prophet said if you desires the prophet said he could do it paragraph 14. now I want you to see how the prophet does this he says then of course putting my mind on it now I want you to imagine this is that bracelet and the prophet that he puts his mind he focuses on it and having her to watch that and not me yeah as many times in the meeting the prophet talks about how we would take a cross-eyed child and not just without even praying for the child he would just look at the child's eyes and focus his attention on the childhood and the child's eyes should come straight amen that's what the prophet says in paragraph 40 paragraph 41 and I use that for an illustration amen let's just skip a few paragraphs paragraph 42 now then of course fasting my eyes to that bracelet which you can yourself if you don't doubt in your heart the property saying you can do it as well and it started to move around and it moved back and forth Crossways and stopped it she said that spiritualism now I can tell you for a fact that this will choke many many message people they would say that that is spiritualism they would say that is fanaticism but amen the prophet amen is giving us this in the very first message that's recorded that we have as a foundation amen amen and he says I thought you say something like that and it profited my isn't it strange how people that profess they know God yet know so little about him amen she said you know we belong to the Church of Christ and the Church of Christ believes amen we speak the Bible where the Bible speaks and we are silent where the Bible is silent and the prophet says you know that is their slogan and I have questioned that a few times amen so the prophet actually questioned the slogan where it says I say Style with the Bible say silent because we know that God can do anything God can actually do something that's not in the Bible because he is God Amen but he chooses to do things that are in his word so that we can have confidence in him he said in his word if it comes to pass we can have confidence in him amen so he said all right she said there's no such a thing can be shown in the Bible or anything like that so she's challenging the prophet and saying what you just did is not in the Bible right and the prophet said I thought you would say that and the prophet said sure it's in the Bible so if we go down to paragraph 43 he says when Jesus passed the tree the Fig Tree the prophet is bringing us back to the same example amen we don't have to read that whole thing but we know what happened Jesus cursed the Fig Tree amen and we know that it wizard away you know something literal something natural amen because Jesus believed that what he said would come to pass amen amen the prophet said now the prophet is I know you're unbelieving Pastor trying to justify his unbelief said that that was a mountain of sin amen because Mark 11 11 Trinity says if you speak to this mountain amen now many people many times when we preach as well we say you know your spiritual Mountain but Jesus was even being literal yeah that if you speak to a literal Mountain absolutely because there's no what Adam did amen Adam could say to the street being knocked and go and plant Yourself by the river and you're gonna be him yeah so Jesus was being quite literal amen Hallelujah and he says if you had Faith the size of a mustard seed and the prophet did not Faith the size of a massive seed would move that mountain how much smaller Faith would you need just to move that bracelet amen there ought to challenge us now amen if something can move a mountain like how we said before is your child greater than the Red Sea be imparted how much lesser Faith do we need Amen to overcome our trials amen the prophet did I've often wondered why it was a mustard seed and he said a master city is the smallest among all seeds that's right but there isn't nothing will mix with a mustard seed a man is all mustard amen you can't mix anything with it kale or nothing and make it grow it's all mustard and if you've got that much Faith all fate not mixed up with something else amen amen not mixed up with any wavering amen it's got to be a genuine mustard amen you've got to be genuine perfect Faith amen amen amen hallelujah now let's go to this next paragraph she says why she said look here I want to ask you something she said did God move that or did the devil move that I yes where everyone's gonna choke amen did God move that or did the devil movie and the prophet said neither God nor the devil moved it he said I moved it by my faith amen amen God didn't do it the devil didn't do it I did it by my faith amen hallelujah so if the prophet could do it back then the seventh seals was not even open title not even yet been restored dilemma.com down the mighty Angel and not come down with the open book as yet and the prophet could do it back then what can we do now amen what can we do in a season where Mark 11 23 is open in a season amen yeah at that time maybe the prophet was opening it maybe in a small measure yeah but now in the season when Mark is opened up amen what can we do amen amen hallelujah would we speak things into existence amen hallelujah what can we do amen if we are the God people walking on the earth amen because we are a God man in this end time the prophet William Branham walking on the earth amen amen and his ministry has produced a God people amen that is now coming into realization of who they are yeah amen and not able not to speak amen and they're able to speak with such Authority that it comes to pass amen amen and when someone has to ask us who made that happen it wasn't God it wasn't the devil amen I made it happen amen look we hear the code amen the prophet of brother will come to you and say I have need of rain and he says I give you rain amen amen hallelujah amen amen so it's I give unto you amen such as I have I give unto you amen thank you hey man the prophet is preaching Us in the very first message amen the foundation message and he's laying this Foundation of Faith amen I know this is the the next paragraph 45 he says but you are a free model agent you being a human being you can resent it in your heart and you can resent it in your heart tonight what what's been preached amen you can resent it in your heart that what we are talking is absolute nonsense you can choose to do that you are free moral agent yes but amen when the evidence is there amen when the works are there differently and prove that this is true amen who unto you amen woe unto you if you resent it amen hallelujah amen you can't be sitting at a camp amen can't be sitting in the camp and notice amen the angel of the Lord moving and you just keep still amen hallelujah amen you can't be in a crowd that is hot and you being cold amen yes it has to make you hot amen hallelujah yes amen so if you are not moving yet soon you are going to start to move amen because as the fire starts to burn you up amen you're gonna start getting started to feel the fire amen thank you [Music] and I want you to notice we're almost done with this chord but the next paragraph the prophet says and then she said well do you mean to tell me then what part does God play with it so the prophet said I I made that happen so she says what part does God play in that and now I want you to see remember the prophet said yeah if you read a little bit of the Prophet said that Jesus said if you say so the prophet is actually referring to Mark 11 23. and then now when she says what part does God have in it the prophet goes on to answer by saying now look there was an angel came down to me amen amen he met me over there he gave me the commission and said you'll be sent with a gift of Divine Healing amen so the prophet is now when she answers this question he signed Mark 11 23 where the angel of the Lord amen and didn't we yeah just recently that the angel of the Lord came into partnership with the prophet and now he wants to come into partnership with the bride amen amen so yeah the prophet is time Mark 11 23 with the angel of the Lord he said the angel of the Lord met me back there amen and he said he commissioned me amen so the same Angel of the Lord has commissioned us amen have we not do we not believe that the angel of the Lord is at the pulpit yeah do we not believe that the angel of the Lord is commissioning us into the nation after what yeah amen so we got to believe that the angel of the Lord is working in partnership with us amen hallelujah and look at this he is preaching this in the first message Amen in the foundation message faith is the substance hallelujah amen and the prophet didn't even realize that he was operating in Mark 11 23 because many years later he said he never understood it amen another quoting man from a different message the prophet says it's a personal individual affair with the person that Christ is revealed to them amen if you say he has been revealed to me and in the Life of Christ produced here in the Bible that same life in him does not reduce itself in you then you've got the wrong Revelation yes now amen let's say Amen to that amen let's say that we are not reducing that life we've got the wrong Revelation amen amen we might have had knowledge yes amen we might have had a theory about the message but we've had the wrong Revelation amen because it must produce the Life of Christ again amen amen hallelujah he says if if a life if I put the life of a pumpkin into the life of a pear tree it would bear pumpkins by the fruits you shall know them amen amen we know amen that the next one brought out apples there's some kind of a grafted Affair in there that's bad in its own life every denomination will be a life of itself but if the original vine ever puts we've heard this for years now but if the original vine ever puts another shoot it will get grapes like it did the first time and in the Life of Christ Jesus Christ ever puts another body of Believers is he put in Forth another body amen it will bear the fruit and the first one like the first one did they will write a book of Acts behind it amen amen because it'll be the same life yes amen just like it did in the second Exodus it'll be the same life amen manifesting itself through US amen so very quickly amen we know that revelation 10 amen brought back title D amen amen in that we can see the third full purpose amen of God now for many years we've been fixed on the second full purpose of God which was Jesus Christ having the preeminence in the church amen but we we haven't focused on that third full purpose amen which was titled deed being restored us coming back into academic condition amen us coming back into Authority us coming back into an image of a God Amen but the prophet preached it amen and we are now coming to that stage where we are starting to manifest their third purpose amen where we are manifesting the purpose of God Amen becoming like a God Amen to this evil age when in this evil age where once again amen there is a Roman superpower amen a Roman superpower that's taken over the world Amen maybe not a physical Empire this time amen but in this evil age where there's a pope who sits in the Throne of God exalting himself like a god love God Amen but God has raised up people in in the end time Amen to be Gods on the earth to combat amen this age we meant to come back the works of the enemy now when titled deity is restored you have rightful rights amen over your property amen and if the enemy tries to take your property a year is where we come to the legal phrase I told you at the beginning in my title um if someone takes your lawful possession from you these illegal remedy called a rave indicatio where you can bring an action in court to claim back amen that which belongs to you yes amen they are called real remedies and they give the owner the power to exclude others Amen to exclude others from access to the enjoyment of his property amen that property belongs to you yeah amen that power that rain that is belongs to you and you have the authority and the power to exclude those that it does not belong to amen it belongs to you amen amen you can bring an action called a raven degasio in the natural to claim back your property yes amen and the requirements for you to bring a successful Raven dicatio is three three requirements one you must prove ownership that you own the property how do you prove ownership you have the title G yes that settles ownership amen title did this come down amen so if you don't have to squander about who's the owner amen yes we know what our rights are like Caleb could say give me my mom today amen he knew what his rights were amen the property must still exist amen are the blessings of God still in existence amen the power of God is still available today amen the third requirement the defendants must be in physical control of the property at the time the action is instituted who is in control amen who has stripped the Church of all the benefits that God has given to the church no one else but the enemy amen amen no one else but the devil yes amen but we have a right to claim back hey amen we have a right to bring a live indication the supernatural power of God is my property amen God sends it upon the Earth because When Jesus ascended he said I give gifts unto me Amen to 85 he is bright amen belongs to us amen so we can claim back amen what belongs to us hallelujah thank you amen hallelujah just quickly amen I want you to notice that in all three Exodus they tried to kill those that were to be raised to be the God man in the first Exodus amen they tried to kill all those two and under because they tried to kill Moses yes Amen in the time of Jesus they killed those three and under because they tried to kill Jesus who was to be raised as a God man amen and for two thousand years amen the church two years amen that the church has been going on Satan has been trying to kill this church amen Satan has been stripping this church amen and trying to kill the church amen but they have not succeeded in all three Exodus amen God was still able to raise up his people God was still able to raise up people that would be Gods on the earth yes amen people that would destroy the works of the enemy people that will torment the devil amen amen like Moses tormented amen the Pharaoh and his army amen like Jesus came and he began to torment all of these evil spirits amen so much so the legion amen begin to cry out amen amen cast me into the Slime yes amen is a God man walking upon the Earth amen that even the Devils recognized him amen we are raised up in this end time the enemy might have tried to kill the church the enemy might have tried to kill amen us even in the message amen by living on the bus they might have tried to kill the standards of the message might have tried to kill the message by bringing all sorts of doctrines in the message amen but God has raised up a people to be gods in this hour amen God has raised up a people amen there would be a standard against the enemy amen they would defeat the works of the enemy amen do you believe that amen Let's Dance [Applause] he did not succeed against Jesus yes he has not succeeded against William Branham the message was stored up in spiritual food but his words to live on yeah amen and he might be trying to kill the people of God that are raised to be gods in this hour but we are here amen amen just send the devil amen amen hallelujah every week to slay demon powers yes every week to sleep those demon powers that will try to oppress us try to keep us Earthbound try to keep us fixed on the earth amen but amen he's trying to take out the conditioning of the world he's trying to take out amen the system of the world Amen that's conditioning our minds that's conditioning our children that's conditioned in the church world Amen there's conditioning even the message world that are left letting down the bars Amen to give in to the conditioning of the world as soon as the sickness strikes fear begins to get into their heart as soon as they hear about cancer fear begins to get into their heart amen they hear about a covert pandemic everyone wants to sit at home and hide amen why because the world is being conditioned and they're bringing the same condition into the church but we resent that right now amen gods of this hour the Lamb of God oh God when you saw Jesus Christ The Life of Christ they will try to confine us oh God thank you yes manifestation of God in our lives natural the Unseen World to be unveiled to us remember those Lord whose eyes open the boys [Music] and kept around us oh God hallelujah we know the angels of the Lord are encountered on us the Unseen World is your god oh let us be aware let us not look at the natural oh God let us stop focusing on God on what we see with our natural eyes thank you Lord be your name is
