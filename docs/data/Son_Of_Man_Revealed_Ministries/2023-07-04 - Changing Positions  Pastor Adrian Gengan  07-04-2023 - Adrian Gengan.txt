in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ am amen what a beautiful day to come into the house of the Lord and worship Him amen hallelujah amen greet your brother and your sister say God bless you amen good to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord amen we under expectation this morning Hallelujah you know when he shows up that's all that matters amen amen anything can happen when he shows up yes so I ask you to be sensitive to the holy spirit because when the angel of God is moving the anointing is strong in the service that's the time to speak amen amen hallelujah that's a time to speak your need yes amen and how many of you know that in order for you to show that you are agreeing with the word of God you've got to say amen amen amen amen is actually telling you that you are actually believing that word the word that you are hearing amen I know a lot of preachers say they Don't Preach for amens I'm preaching for amens amen because my job is to make sure you agree with the word of God Amen so if you don't say amen I know you're not agreeing with the word of God then my brother soan are going to be visiting you why don't you agree with the word of God Amen and saying man is scriptural Hallelujah you know in the book of Nehemiah when you read there you'll see when Nehemiah rebuilt the walls and he was reading the scriptures the Bible clearly states and all the people said amen so saying amen is scriptural the prophet says that the Holy Ghost within you will punctuate every word of God with an amen amen amen hallelujah so you see I'm prepping you up for your amens praise the Lord hallelujah so we also want to wish our sister Victory a happy birthday amen that the Lord will continue to be with her bless her keep her by his grace amen sister continue to be faithful serving the lord Amen in The Fellowship of the Lord amen and the Lord who is your portion and strength will see you through amen when we get to these ages it's the grace of God amen amen and we ought not to take it lightly so we appreciate our sister who appreciate our sister let's give a hand amen praise the Lord many years being faithful in the house of the Lord serving him never wavering through all the trials the amen situation she's been through but she still remains faithful to the Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so we'll turn to our Bible this morning Ephesians chapter 1 amen for a little title we'll take a title called changing positions amen changing positions amen amen praise the Lord so in Ephesians chapter 1 amen Ephesians chapter 1 from verse three says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath past tense blessed us with all spiritual blessings amen in Heavenly places in Christ amen so that is our position Heavenly places in Christ is the believer's position okay and that you come you can see here he had chosen us before the foundation of the world that's what the Bible goes on to say there and he had predestinated us unto adoption of children but my point to emphasize there is blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ amen so if you want to access spiritual blessings you've got to be in Christ amen and then we'll go to Luke Chapter it's Luke chapter 1 you can read from verse 46 amen praise the Lord so we believe that we are another Mary in this time so we reading a portion where the alpha Mary was being was speaking right and Mary said my soul do magnify the Lord and my spirit at rejoiced in God my savior amen for he had regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from H forth all generation shall call me blessed amen amen prophesy over yourself amen when the word comes to you prophesy over yourself prophesy over your family why you've got the word of God you've connected with the angel of God you can now speak with authority and prophesy over your life hallelujah amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated so what was Mary rejoicing about the angel had come to change your position she says he has regarded my lowest state but the angel said blessed are you amongst all women amen amen what was he doing changing her position yes amen amen praise the Lord so we find that being in Heavenly places in Christ is an elevated position amen amen yes this is no ordinary position yes it's selected for a specific class of people amen and it's a glorious position it's a glorious position to be in amen now you know in life you may attain a certain position maybe you want to be a manager director or something like that you want to attain the highest position I am saying Christ has given you the highest position that he could give anybody amen it's a glorious position am now you and I can't live higher than our thoughts we live according to our thoughts the type of life we live the kind of home we live the kind of car we drive is all according to our thoughts amen you can't live higher than your revelation of the word amen that is why the prophet is saying you can't live higher than your pastor because he's the one feeding you so you can't live higher than his revelation so you can't live higher than your revelation of the word if you want to change your life you've got to change your thoughts amen amen yes amen you've got to change your thoughts amen if you want to live in the higher Realms where of spir the spiritual realm in Christ you must think higher thoughts amen yes didn't the God say my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts in Isaiah 55 if you want to take it down yeah let's read it let's see what the word of the Lord is saying here seek ye the Lord while he may be found amen call ye upon him while he is near Amen Let The Wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts amen and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon Him amen maybe you're sitting here and you had your own thoughts doing your own things the Lord is calling you to return to his thoughts amen amen oh thank you Lord and to our God for why he will aband abundantly pardon amen amen doesn't that sound like the prodical son father amen he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts now watch if you think his thoughts Watch What Happens for as the rain cometh down and as the snow from Heaven return not tother but WTH the Earth and bring it forth and Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater so your life is going to be abundantly blessed thank you if you pull down the thoughts of God thank you Lord amen amen and I want you to know the thoughts of God is the mind of Christ and the bride has the mind of Christ so this bride is abundantly blessed amen than you amen so he goes on to say now so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth what word is this the thoughts because the word is a thought expressed am so the word that is coming out of his mouth shall not return unto me void I ask you if you have the mind of Christ and the thoughts of God what words are coming out of your mouth it's got to be the word of God so that word can't return void can somebody say amen hallelujah so you are beginning to speak the word of God Amen so it won't return void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper Amen in the thing where to I sent it send your word forth that word must Prosper that word can't return void amen amen for you shall go out with joyah after you speak the mind of God you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace Shalom amen and the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing you see all your whole entire life is blessed and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the born shall come forth shall come up the F tree and instead of the Brier shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off all because you chose to think higher thoughts amen amen praise the Lord so you've got to change in order to change your position you've got to change your thinking yes amen because the the Bible says as a man think it in his heart so is he amen so the highest thoughts you can have is the thoughts of God and that is why the mind of Christ has come down the bride is the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word amen so maybe you're asking what is the mind of Christ amen what is the mind of Christ amen we'll go to that just now now in a corporate world you know your position determines your level of authority it also unlocks benefits the higher your position is in the company amen I'm talking about your position the higher your position it unlocks benefits amen it unlocks a level of authority the higher you go in position amen that's right so in your home even in your home life God has set it so the position in your home life has a seven certain level of authority amen it's not the children who are running the home yes the husband is the head of the home amen amen praise the Lord the husband is the head of the wife the wife is the head of the children amen so there are levels of authority everywhere you go so so even in the spiritual realm the higher we Ascend into the spiritual realm the higher the level of your Authority amen amen the Bible says that he has given a Measure of Faith unto every man Hallelujah and the prophet of God tells us if he made you 50 cents he said be a best 50 cents coin you can be if he made you a dollar bill be the best dollar bill you can be what was he trying to say whatever level God put you in his kingdom serve God according to his purpose the best you can yes amen amen amen now we cannot be claiming to be in the glory realm and have no Authority amen have no power Amen in the glory realm is Authority is power hallelujah amen position determines your Authority amen your position determines your Authority amen when Adam lost his position what did he lose he lost his authority he lost his power over the earth now something to think about the position was lost not when Eve fell when he fell Adam still had Dominion amen because to him was given the mind of Christ amen he was the guide yeah amen he had the perfect spirit he was not in a fallen State Amen to him was given authority over the Earth hallelujah amen it's only when Eve asked Adam to partake and Adam partt that's the time he was stripped off his title deed and authority over the Earth praise the Lord so when you leave your position you leave your blessing when you leave the word you leave your blessing now you cannot claim the blessings of God if you leave the Heavenly places you may be accumulating wealth people may be accumulating wealth no notice I'm not using blessings there I'm not saying you are blessed I'm saying you're accumulating I'm not calling it blessings you may be accumulating wealth your life may be all right but you are cut off from the blessings of God you are not connected to the source of all blessings amen so which means whatever you accumulating in life you are not getting it from God and your source is from another kingdom amen there are a lot of people who are accumulating wealth in the world non-christians not in Christ they accumulating wealth but where are they getting it from they are getting it from another kingdom didn't the devil offer Jesus the kingdoms didn't he offer him wealth didn't he offer him these things amen now if I ask you brother Jaden can you see the chair in the kitchen can you see it you can't see it in order for you to see it what must you do you must change position you need to change your position to see the chair yeah amen now if you are comfortable where you are sitting and do not if I told gave you an instruction go and sit in that chair because that chair is a higher level of authority that chair you have a better view amen that chair there is got padded seating that chair has got seat warmers that chair has cup holders that chair is fully equipped to make make you feel comfortable I'm showing you a higher level of chair to sit but if you were comfortable there and you did not follow the instruction you will lose your reward amen what if what if you were stubborn or lazy and say well I'm fine where I am you would lose your reward or blessing amen and the only way you can receive the reward of blessing is to follow my instruction amen and do as I tell you then you will receive and live in the blessing amen the same way that is what the preachers are doing they have giving you instruction in order for you to come up into the higher realm and live in the spiritual blessings of God now watch when God changed Abram's position speaking on changing positions right Abram could not be blessed in the land that he was born but God could have done it yeah why didn't God come there in the land and say Abram I'm going to bless you in this land where he was in the condition he was he could not be blessed God had to take him out from where he was placed where he was born and reposition him and even though he was born there he was not going to be blessed there amen you may have been born in a certain home maybe they're religious family but that's not where you're going to be blessed God has called you to a higher realm amen and in this well is a greater blessing and an anointing amen amen hallelujah even though he was in that land and whatever his father had he was going to accumulate the blessing he was going to receive his father's inheritance amen if he stayed in that land all he would have received is his father's inheritance he would have maybe received his father's property whatever he had amen so he could have stayed there and inherited whatever his father was going to give him but that was not God's plan for his life amen he chose because God came to reveal his thoughts to Abraham he said get the out of your country andto a land that I will show you amen so he chose to follow God's thoughts and think higher thoughts and when he began to do that he connected with the mind of God and and God gave him an inheritance where if he looked up to the Stars he couldn't number it if you look to the sand of the sea amen he couldn't number it amen hallelujah amen so what am I saying tell your neighbor When God Says move amen God says move When God Says move move God says move move amen amen Abraham didn't have to listen to the word of God but he chose to listen to it so when God says move move amen it may be uncomfortable it may be all that you ever know you know as humans none of us like change really we are comfortable we don't like change amen hallelujah we like the status quo but God when he's taking you to a higher level he wants you to move so God is moving you changing your position to give you something greater to bless you to enlarge your territory move When God Says move amen now the Bible is full of examples people that God had to reposition in order for the plan of God and the word of God for the age to come to pass here what I said there in order for the scripture to come to pass go God had to reposition them amen hallelujah we just read now about Abraham God had to literally literally reposition him in order for scriptures to come to pass right Jacob had to be repositioned yes he couldn't find a wife in his own country so circumstances made him flee Esau and he went into another country and on his way to that country he met the angel of God Amen he got a touch from the Lord yes his walk was never the same amen amen so God repositioned him and out of that that family lean's daughters came forth the tribes of Israel yes how did he get the blessing by repositioning him I'm going very quickly through these stories Joseph was comfortable in his father's house he was one of the sons of Jacob he was living the best life he could in his father's house he was loved of his father he had a coat of many colors amen hallelujah and his father depended on him to be a snitch in the family and tell him everything the brothers were doing amen but God had a plan for Joseph's life not only for Joseph's life but to save Egypt from famine and the rest of the world so God had to take him through uncomfortable stages of his life reposition him amen and watch the Journeys in his life he got sold as a slave to the midianites but that was not his ought to be condition that's not what all the word had in store for him he got sold as a slave to Piper's house but that was just another stage in the journey he became the head of all slaves there but he wasn't happy with that position amen false accusation brought against him threw him in the prison he became the head of all prisoners but he knew that God why he had a dream he had a dream that people were bowing down to him and you're in the prison nobody was bowing down to him you're in the prison the dream didn't line up with where he was so if the position you are in right now doesn't line up with the word of God keep moving on God is taking into your blessing amen thank you Lord amen if the word of God declares that by the Stripes of Jesus you are healed and right now even physically you are still in a sick condition keep pushing forward with your positive confession your healing is on the way thank you Lord amen praise the Lord amen until he was brought up called by the king because the king had a dream and he needed an interpreter of dreams and he was the best equipped man to reveal the dream amen they called him Joseph the dreamer amen isise the Lord so he revealed the King's dream and the King said no man can reveal this amen this must be God hallelujah amen hallelujah when you open the scriptures and you show them amen if they didn't have pride they'll tell you no man can reveal the scriptures you must be walking with God Amen thank you Jesus amen so that was how Joseph was repositioned he wouldn't have been a source of blessing to the world storing up spiritual food in due season if he had not changed position amen what about Moses Moses had to leave the comfort of Egypt change position he had to change position second in charge to the kingdom was going to become the ruler of Egypt but God changed his position and made him the ruler of his people amen he was The Exodus Prophet God had spoken about him amen hallelujah God had prophesied about Moses that he was going to send a deliverer that was God's thoughts about Moses so God had to reposition Moses to have a pillar of fire experience where he saw the angel of God in the burning bush repositioning Moses repositioning him amen hallelujah Joshua came a certain point in the journey and Joshua amen was living on the other side of the promised land but God was going to use Joshua to reposition the children of Israel and lead them into the promised land amen into the land of the inheritance amen Ruth was living in another country amen a husband and a sons died in that country sorry I'm talking about uh a mother-in-law Naomi thank you Naomi but she was Al she was with Naomi out of position God had to reposition Ruth back in a country in order to connect with boas who was going to be the source of a blessing amen Amen on and on I can go amen God Calla circumstances for vity to refuse to come out to the king in order to shift Esther into a position amen amen amen God don't mind divorcing that first wife Hallelujah I'm not talking about you now please Brothers I'm not talking about you I'm talking spiritually now you know brother Brandon preaches your first husband died yes amen so you only can remarry when your husband dies people take different things from the message now they're going to say Hey you gave me a license Brothers you can only remarry when your wife dies okay I had to say that so V he was put out from the presence of the king shut off from his glory in order to reposition Esther because she had a future work for the Salvation of her [Music] people amen Now esther as well was living in one realm of Queen but she needed to switch it up you may be living in one realm of being the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be living in one realm of being a Son of God he amen you know you are not made a son through adoption you were born son amen you're rep Place son you're a for ordained son you came predestinated because you were a Son of God come on somebody say Amen am the new birth didn't make you a Son of God the new birth only identified that you were the gene of God praise the Lord amen if we think of RAB living comfortable there in a life of sin in Jericho but God had a plan because she was going to bring forth the Future King yes amen she was going to marry a general they were going to bring forth a son amen and the grandchildren were going to be the king of Israel amen God repositioned Raab now let's go into B more spiritual things here I'm just gave you the examples right God will reposition you to bring his word to pass now when elishah asked the Lord open the boy's eyes what was he doing he was asking the Lord to change his boy's position take him to a position where he's not just in a natural carel state amen oh yes but take him into a position where he can see the supernatural realm and the Physical Realm how many of you want to be in that realm where you are able to discern Spirits you are able to see the Supernatural who asked for permission Elisha Elisha can unlock that to you well I wonder who's got the ministry of Elisha in this hour yes amen if we can only find somebody who's got the ministry of Elisha then maybe that realm will unlock to us amen amen praise the Lord amen so you could see this that dimension of heavenly places you saying you're calling it a dimension yes it's a dimension of heavenly places amen so we we spoke about the prodical S briefly there the Bible says he came to himself what was that a changing of his thoughts that was him getting revelation of who he was amen he had to change his position from the pig pen to making his journey back to Father's house where he was restored back to his original position amen yes Lord amen thank you Lord he was restored back to his original position am amen now if we go to John 15:15 I want you to see how Lord Jesus also changes positions of people yeah he's talking to his disciples and he says elw I call you not servants amen a servant has a position right but he's saying I'm going to change your position for a servant knoweth not what the Lord doth so as a servant he won't reveal the Mysteries to you he says but I have called you friends amen amen yes for all things which I have heard of my father I have made known unto you I no longer call you servant but I call you friends let's give the Lord a good of Praise thank you Lord thank you Lord amen Abraham believed God it was accounted him for righteousness and was called a friend of God Amen so God is moving you changing your position to give you something greater to bless you to enlarge your territory amen hallelujah thank you so we we're looking at those things people that God had to reposition in order for the plan of God and the word of God for the age to come to pass God cannot bring his word to pass if these people remain in their positions now you know the prophet says makes a statement you're going to have to fight for every inch of ground right amen it it can be yours you can even own the title DED to it but you've got to fight for every inch of ground amen there he was referencing Joshua they were given the land but they had to fight for every inch of ground amen amen and and I want you to know the enemy Satan wants to destroy your family life he wants to destroy your children he wants to make them drug addicts he wants to make them drug amen drunk Cs and commit fornication mess up their lives amen I asked you a question are you going to let him amen fight for every inch of ground maybe you haven't thought of it like that but that's your inch of ground amen that's your inch of ground maybe you're saying they're already bound I say if they're already bound and they're already all captive by the enemy it's time to go on a rescue mission come on Abraham it's time to go and rescue lot don't leave them in that Fallen condition amen it's time to go where on your knees amen how about you go without food if you're really concerned for them start to pray start to fast start to connect with the supernatural world Amen fight the battle on your kns in prayer amen hallelujah thank you Ephesians 6:12 says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood amen but against principalities so if that person is acting up a certain way you you you are going to waste your time fighting them yes amen when they want to go carnal you go spiritual yes amen we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen hallelujah you say brother are you going to switch it up amen hallelujah amen we're moving gears now amen we're going to change positions amen God has a position for us as Sons and Daughters of God to come to adoption amen amen hallelujah you know that just being born a son in the house is not good enough you don't there's no level of authority placed on you when you're a baby so just being born Sons doesn't give you the authority doesn't give you the of power according to the old amen you know the traditions of Israel you had to be placed under tutors that's Galatians now you had to be placed under tutors yes Hallelujah the Bible says now are we the sons of God but the brand would emphasizes and say not going to be he says because some people are looking for it in the in the in in the new in the heaven but he is emphasizing he says now are we the sons of God Amen amen and what why are we going through our place of testing we're going through tutors are we going through place of trying to show our pedigree to show that we learned well under the tutor and we can take care of father's business amen hallelujah amen so the word of God identifies our position and in order for us to see ourselves clearly in the word we must change our position of how we see ourselves amen we must change our position of how we see ourselves yes we must value ourselves we must know we are people of worth amen yes Lord we must know that we are we are the highest thoughts of God amen amen in this end time God has no replacement oh yes I want you to be comforted and know God has selected you God has no replacement part for you he is depending on you amen hallelujah I need you to connect better with that word amen because right there the silence means that you don't know your worth amen but the word of God identifies our position amen therefore we must know the word of God Amen we must change our position of how we see ourselves God does not want us to live beneath our privileges yes come on now tell your neighbor God does not want us to live beneath live our privileges amen you know what they're talking about woman empowerment you know why because Christ has come to empower his wife in this hour amen amen Christ has come to empower his wife with the revelation of the word amen and he wants her to know what she is what God has made her in Christ now the quote is that the revelation of knowing what you are what you stand for and that you can do the Greater Works will make you an invincible Army what will make you an invincible Army we always quot in the end we Invincible Army but knowing what we are knowing who she is and that's the mind of Christ now about us so that's God's thoughts connecting with his thoughts will make us an invincible [Music] Army amen meaning Invincible Army meaning you are defeating the armies of Satan oh come on soldiers I am meaning that when you get a revelation of yourself and God says you become an invincible Army meaning you are defeating Satan and his enemies Satan and his armies the devil and his 200 million demons Supernatural demons Supernatural devils are powerless before you amen amen yes so I want you to walk up to cancer and tell cancer you are powerless before me I want you to walk up to our disease and say you are powerless before me I want you to walk up to autism and say you are powerless before me thank you Lord hallelujah amen praise the Lord thank you 200 million demons are not amen we are an invincible Army meaning we can never be defeated amen yes oh God thank you [Music] Jesus amen so the preaching of the word is to change our thinking like this morning I pray that your thinking is being changed I pray that you are being empowered this morning change our thoughts to think higher thoughts and align our thoughts with God's word how was God's thoughts revealed to us in this time and season we are no ordinary church amen yes we are coming under the ministry of Malachi 4:5 and Revelation 10:7 the highest thoughts of God being revealed through this Vindicated Prophet somebody give God praise and because we are aligned with the prophet's message we are living the thoughts of God Amen yes amen God's thoughts are revealed through his word therefore we must read his word and understand his word amen Malachi 4:5 and 6 he has come to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers this turning of our heart is to do what change our position amen yes to change your heart to turn your heart means to change your position Amen to turn your thinking amen hallelujah the Turning of your heart is to positionally place you in your true position understand what turning up means turning your heart means he has come to positionally place you amen yes it's easy you know we those are Buzz words people say but they don't really give meaning to it what does it mean to have a turned out God has come to place me positionally the Turning of our heart is the changing of our position amen Revelation I think it's 17 or 18 what is the call to come out of Babylon amen be not partakers of her sin it's God's call for us to change positions amen come out of her my people amen change your position amen amen come out of Babylon conditions come out to your ought to be conditioned in Heavenly places Ephesians 1:3 you know the prophet of God when he was going to get the revelation of the Seven Seals what did he have to do he to change position yes you can put out the quote in the first seal he changed the position of the Bride when he's preaching this listen to what he says I hope that the church understands it what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride amen see that you'll understand it hallelujah amen he had to shift your position because positions determines your level of authority so as church church means called out there were lots of church members but he shifted your position oh come on now this wasn't no ordinary man now you've got to understand Luke 17:13 you've got to understand he was a son of man revealing the son of man so who really was saying to you I call you bride thank you that was Jesus Christ speaking to the bride I call you you [Applause] Pride oh my what was he doing what was he doing positionally placing us for the marriage of the Lamb amen he was positionally placing us for the marriage of the Lamb Revelation 19 the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready amen that sealed was making herself ready praise the Lord when the seal of Revelation 6 and 81 we're going to be revealed brother brandham am man the a son of man was had to speak the words of the son of man and had to change his position now brother brandham literally had to change his position as well and go back West to connect with the Angel's message yeah you'll find in the seven seal what he says he says went West for the blast returned back to the east changing of positions why didn't God reveal the seals in the East he could have done it there was no problem but God wants to bring scripture to pass am amen when God had written it in his mind he knew he had sub be your Canyon he knew he had to be the Arizona desert seven angels come down City life was too much Jeffersonville was was too crowded Jeffersonville was too busy God needed to change the position of the Prophet get him alone amen when West for the blast returned back to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreting this Unwritten word hallelujah amen amen so he came back with the perfect interpretation of the word yes amen [Music] hallelujah what does the scripture tell us watch about more about changing positions changing our image Romans 8:29 says for whom he did for no he also did predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren so we are changing our position by beholding his image amen praise the Lord Romans 12:12 be not conformed to this world but be transformed amen by how the renewing of your mind change your thoughts amen that you may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of God so we are on a journey now Church where we are changing positions from Earthly to Heavenly amen amen amen hallelujah I know if you can say without a shadow of doubt we are seated together with Christ in Heavenly places amen amen hallelujah amen now you say the mind of Christ what is the mind of Christ the quote is the Bride As the mind of Christ she knows what he wants done with the word how many of you don't know what the mind of Christ was only two how many other people want to jump on board how many if you want to know what the mind of Christ is amen hallelujah amen turn to your neighbor say support the pastor please Philippians 2 and 5 eat now Right Chew don't say it's a stone true don't say it's a bone let this mind be in you which also which was also in Christ so this is the mind of Christ right you want to know what it is who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God hallelujah amen who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God what is the Apostle Paul telling us there go back let this mind be in you he's telling you let this mind be in you you are Gods yes amen let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God now brother Brandon would say what Heavenly places are Heavenly places says just for a moment is the believer's position in Christ where the believer stands in [Music] Christ in Heavenly places so that's the believer's position what is that Ephesians 1 and3 I'm defining that for you now amen cuz we're about to climax now amen how many of you ready for the landing I like the takeoff and the landing cuz the takeoff is Fast and The Landing when you hit the the ground you also

position amen you must have the Holy Ghost in This Time in order to be in position the prerequisite for the Rapture is the Holy Ghost no Holy Ghost no Rapture so the believer's position in Christ is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Lord that's our inheritance amen the land of the Holy Ghost didn't he say Ephesians parallels Joshua amen hallelujah they had a physical land we've got a spiritual land the Holy Ghost Land amen praise the Lord amen this Holy Ghost is our guide this Holy Ghost is our leader this Holy Ghost is our teacher this Holy Ghost is a spirit of Truth amen hallelujah

hallelujah who's John a type of somebody tell me John is a type of the but John had to change position in order to receive the open book come on now amen the title did to man's inheritance over the Earth John had to change position he had the Bible says there Revelation 1110 he had to change position he couldn't remain Cardinal now the Bible says I was in the spirit God changing his position taking him to spiritual realm now that's like open the boy's eyes come on Elisha I was in the spirit on the Lord's day he could not receive the the revelation of God while he remained In the Flesh neither will you receive the revelation of God if you remain in the flesh amen hallelujah I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day a changing of position now that wasn't the only time he changed position amen after two after seven Church ages has passed that's Revelation chapter 3 follow me now I'm talking to students of the word amen Revelation 3 ends the church ages and Revelation 4 what is he asked to doen he's asked to come up higher what is God doing changing John's position if you want to see Heavenly things you've got to change your position oh yes amen John had to change his position from the earth and he was called come up higher that's Revelation 4 I looked and behold a door was open in heaven amen have you seen the door a door must be open to you a portal must be open to you to a supernatural realm John called it a door but it's a portal a portal opened up to that Supernatural realm praise the Lord and the first voice which I heard was that his war of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show the things which must be Hereafter yes the only way you believe the message of the hour and see the revelation of God is because you have ascended higher amen yes Lord thank you what happens in verse two and immediately he changes position immediately so first was the call remember I said you can respond to the call like Abraham or not first was the call to come up higher verse two says immediately because he accepted the call because he accepted the call of come out of all my people amen immediately I was in the spirit and behold there was a throne set in heaven and one sat on the throne amen immediately Revelation 10 seven the mystery of God is revealed to him come on come on come on the mystery of God is revealed he sees not a trinity of gods but one set on the throne amen amen catch the Revelation Now Catch the Revelation thousands of church members but only one bride is called to come up higher only one people only a special class of people is called to come up higher only John is shown the complete process of redemption show me which denomination can preach after the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ can preach after the book of Acts show me one denomination can show you that Jesus had a further work of redemption that he had to appear before the elders to complete redemption's work show me a denomination to whom is it revealed only to the bride who has come up higher yes yes amen if John did not Ascend into that spiritual realm he wouldn't have seen the throne room he wouldn't have seen the call for a redeemer Hallelujah so John had to change position John couldn't remain in his denomination John had to leave his denomination or he wouldn't have seen these things praise the Lord amen and John had to further change position from Revelation 5 where he's seeing Oh I pray you get this this morning yeah he's seeing the Redeemer he walked with Jesus he talked with Jesus come on now he lived a life three and a half years with This Man Called Jesus amen and he was there on the mountain when Jesus was taken up in a cloud yes Jesus was ascending with the angels and maybe I thought where is Jesus amen yeah in Revelation 5 now John cannot take the book in Revelation 5 why because heaven is not his position oh yes amen he's a man from the earth and his inheritance belongs on the earth yes amen so John is not the Redeemer so he can't take the book and because John is a type of Eve can Eve take the book no who must take the book Adam must take the book come on give God praise [Applause] amen because I told you the title deed wasn't taken when he fell the title deed was taken when Adam fell so Adam must First Take Back the title deed thank you Lord amen hallelujah am amen amen I want you to know that Adam has already taken back the title deed I want to clear misconception John in Revelation 10 is not Adam taking back the title deed Revelation 10 is Adam sharing his glory with Eve oh you didn't get that amen amen Revelation 10 is a glimpse of the throne room of King aerus up to half my kingdom I give to you amen amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord he could not take the book in Revelation 5 because he's not the Redeemer amen so what am I saying know your position amen don't take things that are not yours yes you don't hear when they're crying who is worthy John didn't go to try and take the book yes hello John didn't go and try and take the book from the one sitting on the throne and the one sitting on the throne told him sorry you're not worthy he knew his position just like our women are asked to know their position and not to handle the word of God I suffer a woman not to teach or Asser authority over man but to learn in silence in the church amen praise the Lord he could not take the book in heaven but the lamb takes the book yes yes the Redeemer now we know that after seven Church ages he's coming back out of the sanctuary because he had to present the sacrifice for seven Church ages amen that's why brother brandom is taking Revelation 5 for the breach so after seven Church ages he's played the part of the M mediatorial work as priest now he's coming back out of the sanctuary showing that the sacrifice was accepted the blood was applied on the altar he coming back out of the sanctuary because after the sin question is settled dominion and Authority must be restored to man amen hello full Redemption means dominion and Authority must be restored to man and the first thing he does once the sacrifice is accepted is to come and take the title deed to the Earth amen Adam does it takes the book now notice he doesn't give the book to John in heaven he doesn't give the book to John in heaven Hallelujah he cannot give it to him in heaven amen like I told you John doesn't belong there yes Hallelujah I know all of you want to die and go to heaven and all if you wish you can live in heaven forever Earth is where God placed you yes amen you're coming back to a renovated earth right amen stop dreaming about dying and going to heaven amen you have a work for you to do here if God wanted to take you it would have taken you long ago amen praise the Lord amen so don't live meaningless lives saying I'm just waiting for my last sweet breath Lord so now you wait 5 years the sweet breath is not coming Lord 10 years go sweet breath not coming now you wasted that time hey be fruitful yes some of you must stop multiplying amen praise the Lord I'm talking to myself here right praise the Lord hallelujah now what must John do again if John wants to ever see this John must change position and come back to the Earth hallelujah amen John can't take the book in heaven John must change position again and come back to the Earth and be positionally placed to see the mighty Angel come down and connect with the seventh angel Hallelujah yes yes what am i showing you you were positionally placed to see the mighty Angel come down and connect with the seventh angel hallelujah amen amen I pray this is not too difficult for you to understand I'm trying to speak in plain language here amen John is changing positions again Revelation 10 he must be positionally placed to see the mighty Angel to hear the seven Thunders John heard the seven Thunders but he's told not to write it yes amen hallelujah he sees the mighty Angel John sees the mighty angel only John sees the mighty Angel others see a vapor Cloud others see a rocket plane Trail but only John sees the mighty Angel John is strategically placed to see the mighty Angel and he confused them even the photographer took the picture in the way that it wasn't supposed to be seen so even they won't get the revelation of it but there's a prophet on the earth and a bride on the earth you must turn the picture to the right in order to to see the mighty Angel somebody give God praise [Applause] amen so John must connect with the seventh Angel's message and John himself is brought into the scene John now becomes an active participant in Revelation 10 all the time he was observing and writing and writing suddenly the scene changes John's position is changed he becomes an active participant in the scene and he doesn't hear the voice from the mighty Angel he doesn't hear the voice from the seventh angel he says I Heard a Voice from Heaven say to me go and take the book that is in the hand of the Angel praise the Lord amen [Music] hallelujah it's now time for John to amen John's part of the word to be fulfilled well I hope you're hearing this amen brother bram's part was fulfilled yes Revelation 10 the mighty Angel's part was fulfilled Revelation 1 101 Revelation 10:7 the prophetic Ministry but Revelation 108-111 activates John part of the ministry amen it puts you into play it puts you on the picture these are the thoughts of God now amen this is the mind of Christ amen it's now time for John's part of the word to be fulfilled he hears a voice from Heaven saying go and take the book from the hand of the Angel so John could not take the book in heaven he had to change position to the Earth he is now in his right position amen and and I told you John is a type of the Bride the wife is now in position yes amen amen and he's announcing to Eve where is Eve in what Eden in Satan's Eden am did she fall in Eden yes would she be fully redeemed in Eden amen come on now it's all under the seventh seal which is a mystery it's a secret coming hello it's a secret nobody knows this is happening even if I shout it out loud they don't have a year to year what I'm saying he's coming back and he's giving a message to Eve go of brought back titled de amen take the book yes eat the book yes Jesus was the Lamb of God Jesus was Adam hello amen Jesus was Adam he took back the book but he won't leave Eve in a fallen condition he brings the book back and he says Eve you gave me to eat and I fell now I'm giving you to eat so that you can live amen come on give God praise am Eve when you gave me to eat of the fruit I lost my inheritance to the earth I lost my power and dominion over the Earth but E I have restored it back eat and live Hallelujah eat be
