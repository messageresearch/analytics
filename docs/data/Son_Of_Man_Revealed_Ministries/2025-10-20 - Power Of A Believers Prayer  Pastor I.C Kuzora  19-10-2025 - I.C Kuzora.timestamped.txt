[7:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Uh because uh I'm here I I pray also
[7:41] that the Lord will speak to our heart
[7:43] this morning.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; And God bless you so much. I will not
[7:47] talk much about the people that I've
[7:50] have accompanied me here. The the
[7:51] brother is already pronounced that. So
[7:54] we go straight into the word. Uh I I
[7:58] don't bring nothing new.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; I have no private revelation.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Because all things will
[8:08] &gt;&gt; through the prophet.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; All we need to do is to recite those.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So
[8:17] uh we only pray that uh maybe to God
[8:20] that he gives us the right thing to
[8:22] recite on a particular day. So we are
[8:26] thankful this morning. God bless you so
[8:27] much.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Um
[8:30] turn with me
[8:32] &gt;&gt; to the book of James chapter number
[8:35] five.
[8:40] Before
[8:53] we read, can we bow our heads and pray?
[8:58] Dear God, our gracious heavenly father,
[9:00] we are thankful this morning,
[9:03] eternal Jehovah, that we are here for
[9:05] one purpose, one objective, and one
[9:07] intention to fellowship with you.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; We're praying, dear God, as you promised
[9:14] in your word that where two or three are
[9:16] gathered in my name, there I shall be in
[9:18] their midst.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; May you fulfill your word this morning.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Precious Lord, as we read your
[9:25] word, may you come and inspire the
[9:28] reading and inspire the preaching. Dear
[9:31] God, that at the end of the service, we
[9:33] will gladly say it was good to be in the
[9:35] present. Help me dear precious Lord as I
[9:39] stand before your holy purchase this
[9:42] morning. I'm praying for your divine
[9:44] guidance and praying for your
[9:46] inspiration. Father God, that whatever I
[9:48] will say this morning will be of benefit
[9:50] to someone here.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; We pray and commit this service into
[9:54] your hands. Have your own way in Jesus
[9:56] precious and wonderful name I pray.
[9:58] Amen.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:01] um the book of uh
[10:04] uh James chapter 11, a very very
[10:07] familiar scriptures that we want to read
[10:10] and we trust the Lord is going to help
[10:12] us and
[10:15] get something out of that.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Like the brother said, uh the
[10:23] bride is from everywhere.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; He's from every nation.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. and uh from every tribe and uh so
[10:33] we happy that uh we are here uh to
[10:37] fellowship with our people.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Do you love the Lord?
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; James chapter number five and uh we're
[10:50] reading very familiar scriptures here.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; Let's pick it from verse number 16.
[10:56] familiar scriptures.
[11:01] Uh, confess your faults one to another
[11:04] and pray one for another that he may be
[11:06] healed. The effect of even prayer of a
[11:09] righteous man athlet.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; So if this is the way things should
[11:17] happen and this is the way to go.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Confess your faults one to another. Yes.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; After that is done, what do you do next?
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Pray one for another.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; That he may be healed.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; I believe uh healing is in in two parts.
[11:37] You can be healed physically,
[11:39] &gt;&gt; but the most important healing is
[11:41] spiritual.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:46] He says the effect of f prayer of a
[11:48] righteous man.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. So it's not every prayer that
[11:51] works.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; That has to be known. It's not every
[11:57] prayer that works.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in a fix your fe of a
[12:02] righteous man.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; It's the one that will avail much.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That means any of prayer will have
[12:09] result.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; We can see this is the result of the
[12:15] prayer.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we pray,
[12:19] &gt;&gt; we think God does not hear,
[12:21] &gt;&gt; but God hears. Not only that, but God
[12:24] answers prayer.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; So sometimes we get to forget that we
[12:31] worship a God who has ears,
[12:33] &gt;&gt; a God that is eyes.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; So when you pray,
[12:37] &gt;&gt; God hears.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; And when he hears, he answers.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So many times we doubt our own
[12:45] selves and we also doubt our own prayer.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; You doubt your own self
[12:53] &gt;&gt; and you doubt your own prayer.
[12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; So Satan will want people like that.
[13:02] People that they that doubt their own
[13:05] selves.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well,
[13:10] &gt;&gt; let me tell you this, brother. Message
[13:14] believers are equipped enough.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the equipment is not far away
[13:20] from you.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; All that you need is with you.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; But Satan would want you to believe that
[13:28] you are inferior.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; We want to tell you that
[13:35] &gt;&gt; your prayer can never be answered.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you feel that God does not
[13:39] hear your prayer. M
[13:41] &gt;&gt; I'm here this morning
[13:42] &gt;&gt; to try and uplift you by the grace of
[13:44] God
[13:45] &gt;&gt; that you must believe in your God
[13:47] &gt;&gt; and believe in yourself.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; Brother says the greatest miracle that
[13:54] has happened under the sun is when a a
[13:57] sinner become a sinner.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; Any other miracles we want them but they
[14:02] come under that one. The greatest.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; So already you must realize that you're
[14:07] a miracle.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. If such a thing would happen to
[14:14] you,
[14:15] &gt;&gt; what about healing?
[14:17] &gt;&gt; It becomes minor.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz God did the major thing.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Upon you, that's the reason you are
[14:26] here.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; In this neighborhood, there are so many
[14:30] people, but so many people are not here.
[14:32] And you are here.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Lord,
[14:36] &gt;&gt; you must believe
[14:37] &gt;&gt; that something happened.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; God had a reason.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; God had a purpose.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; For you. That's why you are here.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Like he say, he says to David, remember
[14:50] where I picked you.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; I picked you from the sheep God.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Pray for a reason and for a purpose.
[14:58] Let's read on verse number 17.
[15:02] He says Elas was a man
[15:05] &gt;&gt; subject to like passions as we are.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; So Elijah was as human as you are.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; He was not a superhuman.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; He of course Elijah was a prophet but he
[15:18] was a human. The Bible says subject to
[15:21] light passions as we are.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; And he prayed
[15:28] &gt;&gt; earnestly.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[15:30] Amen. Elijah prayed earnestly
[15:36] &gt;&gt; that it might not rain.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it rained not on the earth but
[15:43] in the space of 3 years and 6 months.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; So we see the result of Elijah's prayer.
[15:50] He prayed earnestly and he asked God
[15:55] but he would not rain for three and a
[15:57] half years and God heard that prayer and
[15:59] God answered the prayer.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; And for three and a half years there was
[16:04] no rain.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; People did not know what was happening
[16:07] but it was because of the it was the
[16:09] result of Elijah's prayer.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; Verse number 18.
[16:19] And he prayed again
[16:23] &gt;&gt; and the heaven gave rain and the earth
[16:26] brought forth the fruit.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; So prayer can change things.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet says.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; So Elijah, a man, am I preaching to
[16:39] humans to this morning?
[16:41] &gt;&gt; So you can pray a prayer and when God
[16:44] answers the prayer, you will know this
[16:46] is the answer.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; God has answered my prayer. Amen.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; So Elijah prayed because of the
[16:51] condition and the state of Israel. He
[16:54] prayed that for three and a half years
[16:56] &gt;&gt; they would have a drop from heaven.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; No matter their projections and what
[17:01] their signs would say
[17:03] &gt;&gt; I would want to believe the
[17:04] methodological people had projected
[17:07] something about that year. But when
[17:09] Elijah prayed,
[17:10] &gt;&gt; it changed everything.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; And people were wondering what is
[17:16] happening? Is this Elino? Is this what
[17:18] what is this whatever? Elijah knew I
[17:22] have prayed
[17:23] &gt;&gt; that God is not going to bring rain.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; For three and a half years.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; So when it was happening,
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Elijah was says this is the answer to my
[17:32] prayer.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; When the 3 and 1/2 years were up, he
[17:35] comes back to the same God and say,
[17:38] "Lord, this time I'm praying for rain."
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he prayed, God answered
[17:45] that prayer and there came
[17:48] &gt;&gt; So God answers prayer.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; So I want to title my message power
[17:55] behind a believer's prayer.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Power behind
[18:02] &gt;&gt; a believer's prayer.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; Enjoy the comfort of your seat.
[18:15] Uh
[18:16] turn with me again to the book of Mark
[18:19] and chapter number 11 verse number 23.
[18:24] Mark 11:23. Another familiar scripture.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:33] For verily I say unto you, that
[18:35] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[18:38] &gt;&gt; I I like the way the Bible expresses it,
[18:41] &gt;&gt; whosoever.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Whosoever.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; You can put your name there.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Whosoever.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; It's not for particular people.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; It's whosoever. That's right.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Say to this mountain, be thou removed
[19:00] and be cast into the sea, and shall not
[19:03] doubt in his heart, but shall believe
[19:05] that those things which he saith shall
[19:08] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever
[19:11] he saith.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; 34
[19:17] Therefore I say unto you, what
[19:20] thingsoever ye desire
[19:24] &gt;&gt; when ye pray,
[19:27] &gt;&gt; believe
[19:28] &gt;&gt; that he receive them and
[19:32] he shall have them.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; So sometimes
[19:39] we we we don't possess certain things.
[19:42] Not because God does not want us to have
[19:45] them, but it's because we are not
[19:47] following the provided way.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; If you have a desire, I believe every
[19:56] human being, as long as you are alive,
[19:58] you will have desires.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; If you are desireless, you are dead.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But here is the solution to your
[20:10] desire.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:13] And the Lord says, "Therefore I say unto
[20:15] you,
[20:17] &gt;&gt; what thingsoever ye desire,"
[20:20] &gt;&gt; so if you have a desire, a right desire,
[20:24] that's fine.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Don't just wait there and keep on
[20:28] desiring and keep on desiring and keep
[20:30] on desiring. Move to the next step.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; So if you have got a desire, that's
[20:38] wonderful.
[20:41] But your next step is after the desire,
[20:44] what must you do? You must pray.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; And when you pray, you must believe.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; And when you believe, then you must
[20:53] receive.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; So I I normally say to brothers, there
[21:01] is an equation,
[21:04] not a mathematical equation, no.
[21:08] But any question in the faith
[21:11] &gt;&gt; that desire plus prayer plus believing
[21:14] is equals to receiving.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; This is how the equation is completed.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Desire. If you say desire and desire and
[21:26] desire and desire, it might not do you
[21:29] any good.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Move to the next. We want the equation
[21:33] completed.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; We want to solve the equation. Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you ask children that go
[21:42] to school
[21:43] &gt;&gt; in mathematics, they say solve this
[21:46] equation.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; You must follow the proper steps to
[21:50] solve the equation. So desire plus
[21:54] &gt;&gt; prayer
[21:55] &gt;&gt; plus.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Believing equals receiving.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Then the equation is complete.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:07] These things we we have them.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; The Lord has already given us.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; A believer is someone who is equipped.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; And equipped to the full.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; So sometimes Satan will tell you you
[22:28] some down something.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; You're some useless. Not in this faith.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; There are no useless people. If you are
[22:36] living right, doing right, and you
[22:37] believe the word, you are you are
[22:40] useful.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; So, let's look at this. The power behind
[22:49] a believer's prayer.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to believers this morning.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; I want to show you that there's a power
[22:55] behind your prayer. Amen.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; You in your individual capacity right as
[23:01] you are there.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking of what is in your
[23:04] pocket.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; That's not the issue.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; I want to talk about what is in your
[23:08] heart.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It has to be coming from somewhere
[23:13] when you pray from the heart.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Then something must happen.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Remember brother Brham says
[23:23] &gt;&gt; we can sin too much.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:26] Amen.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you you say, "Hey, the song
[23:30] service was too long. That's too much."
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; And he says, "You can laugh too much.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; You can do any other thing too much.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; But there is one thing that you can
[23:48] never overdone, which is prayer."
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may laugh too much.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; You may shout too much.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; You may eat too much.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; But you never pray too much.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; When Christ sent his disciples
[24:11] &gt;&gt; to go two by two. He never taught them
[24:13] what how to preach.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; He never taught them how to testify. He
[24:17] say just go.
[24:20] Huh?
[24:21] &gt;&gt; So to preach, he never taught them.
[24:25] to testify. He never told them. But one
[24:27] time in Luke chapter number 11 when
[24:29] Christ the disciples were trying to look
[24:31] at Christ the way he lived.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; So at one time after he had finished
[24:37] praying, they came back and said, "Lord,
[24:39] teach us how to pray."
[24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; So you cannot just pray, you need to be
[24:45] taught.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; And you can't be taught by anyone. It is
[24:49] only God who will teach you how to pray.
[24:51] Hallelujah.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; And they say, "God, teach us how to
[24:54] pray." We heard that John would teach
[24:57] his disciples how to
[25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; In one message, Brother Brandham says,
[25:11] I think we must read this one.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; He says,
[25:17] um, prayer is an atomic bomb.
[25:20] Yeah.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Huh.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; In the message expectation
[25:25] &gt;&gt; uh preaching on the 7th of February 1961
[25:29] is 610207
[25:31] and paragraph number 25. I think that we
[25:33] must read.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together there?
[25:39] &gt;&gt; What man calls great,
[25:42] &gt;&gt; God calls foolish.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Always remember this.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:50] So we mustn't go by the type.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. What man calls great
[25:55] &gt;&gt; then God calls that foolish.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; And what man calls foolish, God calls
[26:03] great. You see the world and the word
[26:06] are always par.
[26:08] So if by the world
[26:12] you must that tight is foolishness to
[26:14] God.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Remember that. Yes.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; If you go the tide of the world is
[26:20] foolishness.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; But the world says if you go the tide of
[26:25] the word, the world says that's
[26:27] foolishness.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Ah. So what we got to do is get back
[26:33] into the problem program problem program
[26:34] of God and find out.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Don't you want that?
[26:40] &gt;&gt; So God has a program
[26:42] and you and I must go back to that
[26:44] program.
[26:47] Amen.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; And he says in order for us to go back
[26:53] into God's program because God has a
[26:55] problem as we speak
[26:58] and we we want to find out what that
[27:00] problem is. After all, he says what? And
[27:03] uh um so what we've got to do is get
[27:08] back into the program of God
[27:11] &gt;&gt; and find out after all what God wants us
[27:17] to do.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; So God wants you to do something.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. How then do you know what God
[27:26] wants you to do?
[27:27] &gt;&gt; You must find out there's a program for
[27:29] you. That's right.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Designed by God.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the only way, that's what
[27:38] brother says, the only way I know to do
[27:42] it is prayer.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; So prayer is a provision
[27:49] for you to get into God's truth.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; For you to know what God wants.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I tell you, Satan will fight
[28:01] prayer like you never want.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; I would not be surprised that someone
[28:07] has come to church this morning and
[28:09] never pray.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; It's not that you are very evil.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; But Satan fights that thing.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; He understands what prayer means
[28:20] &gt;&gt; and he understands what prayer can do.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brother?
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. for you to get into God's program.
[28:28] Prayer is the key.
[28:32] That's the answer. Prayer changes
[28:35] things.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we forget these things.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Brother says prayer is the key.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; The key.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; What does the key do?
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It gives you access.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[28:55] Amen.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; It might sound like it's very a very
[28:58] small component, but if you don't have
[29:01] the key to that door, we can't access
[29:03] here.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; And when you are outside and it's
[29:07] raining, what happens
[29:11] &gt;&gt; when it's hot? What happens
[29:14] &gt;&gt; when it's cool? What happens? It's
[29:16] because you are failing to get the
[29:18] access.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; So prayer is the key. Amen.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Prayer gets you in there.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[29:35] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, watch this one now.
[29:38] Prayer is the most powerful weapon
[29:42] &gt;&gt; that was ever put in control of the
[29:44] human beings.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; No. Prayer is the most powerful weapon.
[29:52] If you ask anyone who is not a message
[29:55] believer and ask him which is the most
[29:57] powerful human, they will tell you about
[29:59] the atomic power.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; But we know better than that.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[30:08] was ever put in in the control of human
[30:11] beings.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:13] There is no atomic bomb
[30:16] or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as
[30:20] prayer.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Prayer would change the mind of God.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; So you are fully and dangerously
[30:32] equipped.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; So you are not cheap.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Let me help someone this morning. You
[30:41] are not cheap.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; You are fully equipped
[30:46] &gt;&gt; and dangerously equipped.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Is the only thing that can change God's
[30:52] mind.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Because we read in the Bible that God
[30:57] sent his prophet by the name of Isaiah
[30:59] to King Hezekiah.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; And he says Hezekiah was sick.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; And when Isaiah came, he came with just
[31:09] says the Lord.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. M
[31:12] &gt;&gt; I believe when Hezekiah saw Isaiah
[31:14] coming in, he says he brings good
[31:17] tidings.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; God has remembered me. Isaiah came, he
[31:22] says, "Oh king, your majesty, I've got
[31:26] news for you."
[31:27] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Say all." He says, "Thus
[31:30] says the Lord,
[31:32] &gt;&gt; put your house in order.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; You're going to die."
[31:36] And when he said that
[31:39] Isaiah left
[31:42] with such tidings but Hezekiah here the
[31:45] king
[31:47] &gt;&gt; instead of him crying
[31:49] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; He says it's okay man of God.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; I know where to go.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; He faced the wall and he began to pray.
[32:00] Yes.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; If you read in the Bible the type of
[32:03] prayer he met, he says, "Lord, you know
[32:05] me." I like that. It was a face to face.
[32:09] It was Hezekiah and his God.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; They knew one another. A believer must
[32:14] know his God and God must know him.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Many people pretend or assume that they
[32:22] know God, but God does not know them.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; That's the unfortunate part. But a
[32:27] believer is in connection.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; You and your God.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; So Hezekiah looked to the wall and he
[32:34] began to pray. And God answered that
[32:37] prayer. He had the prayer.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Before Isaiah left the court,
[32:43] &gt;&gt; the king's palace. God came down to
[32:45] Isaiah with another says the Lord.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things. If you want
[32:53] things change brother
[32:55] &gt;&gt; pray
[32:58] &gt;&gt; don't m and cry and also no pray
[33:05] &gt;&gt; right
[33:06] &gt;&gt; what comes down to Isaiah says go back
[33:07] to his but I've pronounced I've told him
[33:12] says no no no there's a different
[33:14] trajectory now go back to him and tell
[33:17] him that I've heard your
[33:19] &gt;&gt; prayer immediately
[33:20] &gt;&gt; I've given you the 15 years that you've
[33:23] requested.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Prayer changes
[33:28] &gt;&gt; things.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you sometimes don't forget
[33:34] family prayer.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; It's integral part of our being.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's not every prayer. The
[33:49] fixual fever prayer of
[33:53] &gt;&gt; a righteous man.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; It availth
[33:57] much.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Can I drop something here?
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Something very interesting, brother.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Prayer of a righteous man of faith much.
[34:11] Huh? But uh
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Satan hates the brain believer. Yes.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that?
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; He hates
[34:25] &gt;&gt; a praying believer.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Was in the message. Believe in God.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; 52 0224. Believe in God. Paragraph 150.
[34:36] Something very interesting. Listen to
[34:39] what the prophet says here.
[34:43] And I know this
[34:46] that some of us has more faith than
[34:50] others
[34:51] &gt;&gt; which is fine. We can't be at the same
[34:53] level.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Some have got more faith than others.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:03] And those who have abundance of faith
[35:06] are supposed to pray for those.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; You see that? Amen.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Those that have abundance of faith, what
[35:14] must they do?
[35:16] &gt;&gt; They must pray for those that is lesser
[35:18] faith.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; But here is something very important.
[35:31] But the prophet then says, "But if you
[35:34] don't live right,"
[35:37] &gt;&gt; uh if you don't live the right kind of
[35:41] life,
[35:42] &gt;&gt; you better live away from it from what?
[35:45] From prayer,
[35:48] &gt;&gt; do you hear that?
[35:50] &gt;&gt; The devil
[35:52] will laugh at your prayer. Yeah.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; My God.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; If you don't live the right kind of life
[36:02] &gt;&gt; and then you will try and pray, you
[36:05] wasting time.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; One person who is very happy is the
[36:09] devil.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; When you are praying, he loves you.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Or maybe he cheers you up. Then pray on,
[36:19] pray on, pray on. Satan himself
[36:28] But when you live right
[36:31] and do right and act right and have
[36:36] faith in God, Satan, not demons,
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Satan himself
[36:43] will tremble when you speak.
[36:46] Amen.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; You see why Satan tries to hinder you
[36:52] from praying?
[36:54] &gt;&gt; If Satan trembles, what happened to the
[36:56] demons?
[36:56] &gt;&gt; They already fallen.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Satan will tremble at your prayer.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Because God swore under obligation he
[37:15] would take care of that prayer.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; So
[37:24] he never prayed in vain. Many people
[37:26] would want to believe that ah I think
[37:28] God did not answer hear my prayer. Let
[37:31] me tell you this morning God he had
[37:35] every prayer.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. And God will answer every prayer
[37:40] &gt;&gt; because what what you remember what
[37:41] happened to Daniel
[37:44] when Daniel prayed in a very foreign
[37:47] land was in Babylon.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; But still the Babylonian
[37:54] situation would not hit Daniel's breath.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Daniel prayed in. So you can pray.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. uh in this other side of the
[38:04] remember
[38:05] um it is for a believer it is the most
[38:08] glorious time
[38:10] &gt;&gt; but I tell you from creation
[38:14] the the earth has never been in this
[38:16] state where it is now.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Now it has rotten to the core.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; It becomes in inhabitable.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:29] You remember the scripture says the
[38:31] spirit
[38:33] and the bride
[38:35] &gt;&gt; they say come.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; It's so burdensome.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; People are drinking sin like water.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; When we you think it's happening just in
[38:55] South Africa, it's happening everywhere.
[38:57] Yes.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; If you still want and you living
[39:05] comfortably in this earth, something is
[39:07] wrong somewhere.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; When we look around, we say it's it's
[39:16] homegoing time.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; But in this Babylon,
[39:20] &gt;&gt; in that condition, God still answers
[39:22] prayer.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; You can pray to God.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. and God will answer the prayer.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Things are so bad.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; No, you know, you see um
[39:38] the Bible refers. It says, "But as it
[39:40] was in the days of
[39:42] &gt;&gt; No. Huh?
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. As it was in the days of
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[39:50] how many?"
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; People had forgotten the days of Lord.
[39:55] People had forgotten who they are.
[39:58] The spirit of Sodom was so bad.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Remember Lord's daughters.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; The the the boys there for whatever
[40:10] reason maybe they wanted these
[40:12] certificate for certain benefit.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; They come and the bowler to Lot and say
[40:17] no forget about the
[40:19] &gt;&gt; and they were sodomite.
[40:23] That spirit
[40:26] has reached the peak now.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; If God destroyed and Gomorra that
[40:32] &gt;&gt; this earth cannot be spread.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Because you must if that be so God must
[40:38] go back and resurrect the people of
[40:40] sorrow
[40:41] &gt;&gt; and apologize.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; That's exactly where we are at. Yes.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; To such an extent that uh uh uh
[40:51] believers if ever there was a time when
[40:54] believers desired to be connected to
[40:57] God, it is now.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; I I I I I think
[41:12] everywhere else you see
[41:16] Preachers
[41:18] are encouraging
[41:20] people that you must receive the Holy
[41:22] Ghost.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Why?
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost is your ticket.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; To the rapture.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; There's no way you can get to the
[41:35] rapture without the Holy Ghost.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; I was preaching one time back home. I
[41:44] said
[41:47] I hear people say in 2027
[41:52] I'll go to Canada but we're in 2025.
[41:56] Huh?
[41:58] He talks of going to Canada in 2027.
[42:04] Huh?
[42:06] &gt;&gt; He knows
[42:08] the the airplane number.
[42:12] Not only that,
[42:14] he also knows his seat number
[42:21] &gt;&gt; in an airplane that you fly in in 2027
[42:25] while it's in 2025.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; You know the airplane, you know the seat
[42:30] number, you know the departure time
[42:33] &gt;&gt; and the landing time. Huh?
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; And brother Bernham says rapture will be
[42:44] between
[42:45] &gt;&gt; 6 and 9.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; So we know the time.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you you you you you can sit
[42:54] down and relax and tell people that I
[42:59] will go to Canada.
[43:01] If people don't understand how things
[43:04] work,
[43:05] &gt;&gt; they will see you as someone who's
[43:07] crazy.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:09] to say I'll be sitting on seat number 5B
[43:15] &gt;&gt; in 2027
[43:17] in Fly Emirates.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[43:23] Precisely.
[43:27] But some great morning
[43:29] &gt;&gt; when this life is over, I will fly away.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; So I must also have the ticket. Hh.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to rush and say
[43:38] on the day he said go to to to pay and
[43:41] say I'm coming to check in. He say fine
[43:44] give us your details.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Sorry sir.
[43:50] Can I find you?
[43:52] So you have got no seat in flying.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; So right now we are in preparation.
[44:04] Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; I always tell the brothers that there's
[44:07] some enthusiasm we have
[44:10] &gt;&gt; when we go for conventions. I don't know
[44:11] what happens here in South Africa but in
[44:13] our country when people go for
[44:15] conventions there is a lot of
[44:17] enthusiasm.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of preparation going for
[44:21] the convention.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; But remember we are also going for one
[44:28] &gt;&gt; an eternal youth convention.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Huh?
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; So we must be enthused.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; There must be a curiosity
[44:40] &gt;&gt; preparing for the convention.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; So you say there are things needed
[44:46] &gt;&gt; in the convention.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; There are things that you don't need. So
[44:51] what do we do? We pack and unpack.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Leave all the things that are not
[44:57] needed.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; And pack all the things that are needed.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your suitcase must be ready for
[45:04] the coming convention.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; When you prepare, you be sure that you
[45:11] have your ticket.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So you must have your
[45:17] ticket
[45:18] &gt;&gt; to go to that convention, eternal youth
[45:20] convention. This is why we are this is
[45:23] what we are doing to prepare for that.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; But the ticket is the Holy Ghost.
[45:31] Huh?
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Does this take fasting to have the Holy
[45:34] Ghost?
[45:36] You can fast and fast and fast and fast
[45:38] and never get
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Why? The Holy Ghost is a gift.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Is that all?
[45:46] &gt;&gt; So for you to have the gift, you must
[45:49] please the giver.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; I see parents here. How do you feel when
[45:58] a child comes from school with a report
[46:03] and that report is showing that he's
[46:06] excellently doing the right thing?
[46:09] The moment you see that report
[46:16] before you talk to the child, the father
[46:18] and the mother, they lock themselves in
[46:19] the bedroom and they ask one another,
[46:21] "What must we do for this one?"
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:26] Uh-huh. Hey, you have praised the
[46:29] parents.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; They will do all they can
[46:34] &gt;&gt; to get you a gift.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; In appreciation of what you did.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; So that they encourage you. So the Holy
[46:41] Ghost is a
[46:44] &gt;&gt; gift. Where is it coming from?
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; From God. So if you want the Holy Ghost,
[46:50] what you do? Please the giver.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; If you do right, act right. Live right
[46:56] up.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[47:02] &gt;&gt; It's good to fast, but
[47:04] you can fast for the Holy Ghost the
[47:06] whole of your life and never receive it.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Please the giver.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; God is attracted by a life.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Some say, "Keep me true,
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Keep me true."
[47:28] &gt;&gt; There's a race that I must run. There
[47:30] are victories to be won.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Give me power every hour to be true.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; So Daniel when he prayed, even though he
[47:44] was in Babylon, God heard the prayer and
[47:49] God answered the prayer.
[47:52] Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; And he said maybe God did not answer it
[47:55] was answered right there. But when was
[47:58] coming with the answer, the chief the
[48:02] the prince of Persia with stood him for
[48:04] 3 weeks.
[48:06] But the the the prayer was already
[48:09] &gt;&gt; answered.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; So let me assure you brother, your
[48:14] prayer was answered.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; God heard it the moment you pray. Amen.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; And God answered it.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; So relax.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Don't allow Satan to tell you that God
[48:30] did not hear. He had
[48:33] &gt;&gt; he did not just hear, he had and he
[48:38] &gt;&gt; according
[48:42] God is not a man.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; He answers the way he wants it. But the
[48:49] answer is your prayer was answered.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me brother, sister?
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Can I add more?
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes people
[49:04] when God answers they overwhelmed they
[49:07] even doubt their prayer.
[49:11] Huh? You have prayed.
[49:14] When God answers even doubt say ah no it
[49:16] can't be
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter number 12 let me show you
[49:27] something
[49:30] Acts 12 verse number one
[49:33] these are simple scriptures that we know
[49:37] you see something was happening
[49:41] Herod was doing
[49:44] Now about that time, Herod the king
[49:46] stretched forth his hand to vex certain
[49:48] of the church.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; So you must know Herod can also stretch
[49:53] his hand to vex you.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; But you must know what to do.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; And and he killed James
[50:07] the brother of joy
[50:09] &gt;&gt; with the sword.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[50:14] Who was James? The disciple.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; One of the 24 elders.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; When the devil straight his hand, he got
[50:26] a hold. He was the son of
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Ze.
[50:30] James was killed.
[50:33] Believers went for a funeral of a
[50:35] brother that was killed.
[50:40] And when that happened,
[50:42] when that happened, huh, verse number
[50:45] three says, "And because he saw it,
[50:48] please the Jews,
[50:52] huh,
[50:53] &gt;&gt; the unbelieving Jews,
[50:55] &gt;&gt; they rejoice over James.
[50:59] Praise the Lord."
[51:01] &gt;&gt; He proceeded further to take Peter also.
[51:07] Then there were the days of unleven
[51:10] bread.
[51:13] And when he had apprehended him, he put
[51:16] him in prison and delivered him to the
[51:19] four continions of soldiers to keep him
[51:22] intending after Easter to bring him
[51:24] forth to the people so that Peter will
[51:26] be killed too.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The believers were coming right
[51:32] from a funeral of a brother
[51:34] &gt;&gt; who was killed by Herod.
[51:40] And they said we step up higher. They
[51:42] took Peter
[51:44] &gt;&gt; the preacher.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together brother?
[51:53] &gt;&gt; And he said now we are waiting for this
[51:55] holiday to go through. Then Peter is
[51:57] gone. He followed the same footprints
[52:00] the same steps
[52:03] where James went and
[52:06] verses.
[52:09] Peter therefore was kept in prison but
[52:14] prayer was made without ceasing
[52:16] &gt;&gt; of the church unto God for him. Amen.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; For James probably they were reluctant.
[52:25] But when it came to Peter, the church
[52:27] gathered together to do what?
[52:29] &gt;&gt; To pray.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; They were praying without ceasing, they
[52:33] were praying to God about Peter.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Read one, brother.
[52:39] And when Herod would have brought him
[52:41] forth, the same night Peter was sleeping
[52:44] between the two soldiers bound with two
[52:46] chains and the keepers before the door
[52:49] kept the prison.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Imagine brother Peter was not a
[52:54] criminal.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; He was just a believer.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; But they wanted to be sure that Peter is
[53:00] not going to escape. He was put in
[53:02] between soldiers
[53:05] &gt;&gt; and he was like in the inner prison
[53:08] chain binding him.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; I'm sure Peter was saying Lord thy will
[53:16] be done.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done. Sometimes a brother is
[53:23] in a situation
[53:25] he can't even pray.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; So he needs your prayer.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] That's right.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Pray for me and I'll pray for you.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; So Peter right there
[53:40] in such state the the brothers were at
[53:43] John Mark's place. Now
[53:45] &gt;&gt; you Bible believers Bible readers they
[53:48] were John Mark. What were they doing?
[53:50] Praying without ceasing.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; They said we are not going to go back
[53:57] home. We are going to have an all night
[54:00] prayer
[54:01] &gt;&gt; praying for our precious brother Peter.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; You see that that brotherly feeling
[54:06] &gt;&gt; that feeling.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Pray for your brother. Pray for your
[54:09] sister.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you hear a prayer
[54:13] request, don't put don't take that for
[54:16] granted.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; It's a request.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Be honest and pray.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; But the saints were gathered.
[54:25] Pray now. And behold, the angel of the
[54:28] Lord
[54:29] came upon him, and a light shined in the
[54:32] prison, and he saw Peter on the side. It
[54:35] raised him up and said, "Rise up
[54:36] quickly."
[54:37] &gt;&gt; And his chains fell off his head.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Pray.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Pray without ceasing. Lord, do something
[54:48] about our brother.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; We can't have another funeral of a
[54:52] brother dying in that way.
[54:56] Huh?
[55:00] Enough is enough.
[55:03] Satan, you are defeated. Satan, you are
[55:05] liar.
[55:08] It was serious business. People were not
[55:10] sleeping in that one night.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; And an angel comes. It was in the night.
[55:16] It comes to Peter Pim says rise up
[55:20] quickly. When he rose up, chains fell. M
[55:23] &gt;&gt; soldiers were still there and asleep.
[55:27] My God. And he says, okay, let's let's
[55:31] read on. And the angel said unto him,
[55:34] get thyself and bind on thy sandles. And
[55:38] so he did. And he said unto him, cast
[55:40] thy garment above thee and follow me.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Soldiers were still asleep. He was in
[55:45] the in the prison. Yes.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Peter says, "Dress up. Follow fast.
[55:50] Change them for." He follows the angel.
[55:54] Soldiers asleep. You imagine the doors
[55:56] with their chains. What would happen?
[55:58] Doors would open.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; The angel now.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; The angel of
[56:03] &gt;&gt; a
[56:04] &gt;&gt; taking of Peter out of praise the night.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; But what was it? Prayer.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; And he went out and followed him. And
[56:13] whis not that it was true which was done
[56:16] by the angel but thought he was he saw a
[56:18] vision even that bit.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; It was too much for him. He thought it's
[56:24] a vision.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "Is this a vision? Is this
[56:29] reality? Is it a vision?" Huh? And
[56:34] oh my god. Verse the next verse says,
[56:37] "And when they were passed the first and
[56:40] the second one, they came unto the iron
[56:42] gate that led unto the city, which
[56:46] opened to them of his own accord."
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:52] And they went out and passed on through
[56:54] one street and fought with the angel
[56:57] departed from you.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; So the angel led Peter to familiar
[57:01] grounds.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Then Peter realized
[57:06] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm Oh, this is
[57:09] &gt;&gt; the the the the the brothers. Let me go
[57:12] to the nearest. It was John Mark.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; So Peter goes to um John Mark's place.
[57:19] Yet that was the venue for the prayer
[57:21] meeting.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; They were praying for Peter.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; For what? For Peter to be released.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; They were praying, Lord, we are praying
[57:28] for a miracle.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't that so?
[57:32] &gt;&gt; We are praying for a miracle. Lord, do
[57:34] something about our brother.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:38] Peter says ah
[57:40] when Peter came to him said now I know
[57:43] of that the Lord had sent his angel and
[57:45] he delivered me out of the hand of Herod
[57:47] and from all the expectation of the
[57:49] people of the Jews back let's face and
[57:52] when he considered this thing he came to
[57:54] the house of Mary the mother of John who
[57:57] said was Mark
[57:59] where many were gathered together
[58:01] praying
[58:04] &gt;&gt; you see that brother Huh? Let's go on. I
[58:07] want to show you something. And as Peter
[58:09] knocked at the door of the gate, a dam
[58:12] came to named Ro.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; A sister came. There was a knock at the
[58:19] gate.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Ro rushes to see who's knocking the
[58:23] gate. Who did he see? Peter.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; I believe this this language that we
[58:30] have. When saw Peter Peter saw, he says
[58:33] shalom.
[58:36] says, "Oh sh
[58:39] How are you? How how is it that you are
[58:41] here?" He said, "No, it's I I would not
[58:44] open the the gate."
[58:47] She goes back. People still praying,
[58:50] praying, praying.
[58:52] He knocks and he pets one of the
[58:54] deacons. He says, "Brother
[58:57] Peter is by the gate there." She said,
[58:59] "What
[59:01] brother?"
[59:03] She Peter says, "No, no, no. Peter's in
[59:05] jail. He steing my breath."
[59:12] &gt;&gt; The Peter is by the gate. I spoke to
[59:15] him.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; She said, "No, no, no. We don't want
[59:17] people that dream.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Where you praying?
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Let's pray, sister. There's no time to
[59:23] waste."
[59:26] But
[59:28] man of God, brother Peter is by the
[59:30] gate.
[59:34] And when she she knew Peter's voice, she
[59:37] opened to the gate for gladness, but ran
[59:40] in and told how Peter stood before the
[59:42] gate.
[59:44] And they said unto her,
[59:46] &gt;&gt; "Unto sister Rod,
[59:50] &gt;&gt; thou art mad."
[59:55] Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Now, sister Roa was mad.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Thou art mad, but she constantly
[1:00:06] affirmed that it was even so.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; She was not disturbed by what was said.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; They said, "Sister, we we don't want
[1:00:15] people like that.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; You disturbed me in the prayer meeting."
[1:00:19] She said, "Hey, your prayer has been
[1:00:21] answered." But Peter is by the gate.
[1:00:24] Says, "You are mad." said, "I
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; brother Peter is by the gate there."
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; She did not budge.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; That same day it is his angel.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; If it was our language,
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; they would have said, "Sister, you have
[1:00:46] seen his
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Theophony."
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; She said, "No,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; it is him. Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; So what happened?
[1:01:01] But Peter continued knocking.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; And when they had opened the door and
[1:01:07] saw him, they were astonished.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; But he beckoning unto them with the hand
[1:01:15] to hold their peace, declared unto them
[1:01:18] how the Lord had brought him out of the
[1:01:19] prison. And he said, "Go show these
[1:01:22] things unto James and to the brethren."
[1:01:24] And he departed and went into another
[1:01:26] place.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; The answer to the prayer was too real.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; That the people doubted their prayer.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; They doubted the answer to their prayer.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; They said it can't be. It's in the
[1:01:42] night.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; God answers.
[1:01:50] And when the prayer is answered,
[1:01:52] sometimes you are overwhelmed by the
[1:01:54] answer.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Can can this be? Yes, it can be.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God answers prayer when you pray
[1:02:04] belief.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Then you shall receive.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; And a miracle happened in prison.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Peter, I believe at that juncture was in
[1:02:14] a hopeless state. But prayer,
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; prayer of believers
[1:02:20] changes things.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I always tell the brothers
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; that after you have done praying
[1:02:25] everything and praying for everything
[1:02:26] else and before you close your prayer,
[1:02:29] pray for me.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Just remember me in that prayer. I know
[1:02:32] what that means.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; So I I solicit for brother's prayer. I
[1:02:41] know what it means.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:46] Are you with me brother sister?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Can I uh show you one quotation and then
[1:02:51] I think I should close.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; One more quotation. Bear with me.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; 606
[1:03:00] 09. Be not afraid. And par number 29.
[1:03:08] Show you something here. There's
[1:03:09] something very interesting. Are we
[1:03:10] together?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Listen to this.
[1:03:15] Someone said to me,
[1:03:17] someone said to brother Brana, I believe
[1:03:21] was last evening say, "Brother Brana,
[1:03:23] where does this come from?"
[1:03:27] So this someone who asked, "Brother
[1:03:29] Brana saw something unusual." He saw
[1:03:33] something spectacular.
[1:03:36] Are you with me?
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Brother, where does this
[1:03:39] come from? How are you able to go
[1:03:42] meeting after meeting staying under the
[1:03:45] anointing?
[1:03:47] And even one sign made uh uh Jesus weak
[1:03:51] when the woman touched his garment said
[1:03:53] I see you stand for hour under that.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; You see that brother
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; a question a noble one. Someone asks a
[1:04:06] prophet how are you doing it? How is it
[1:04:10] happening week meeting day after day
[1:04:13] meeting after meeting with the level of
[1:04:16] the anointing that we see upon?
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; How are you managing?
[1:04:23] Because one woman with a blood issue
[1:04:26] when she came to Jesus, she touched the
[1:04:29] hem of his garment and Jesus said vet
[1:04:32] went out.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Is that all?
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when virtue goes out what
[1:04:40] happens? You become weak.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; But brothers was asked with this type of
[1:04:45] an anointing
[1:04:48] how is it happening?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Where is what is the secret
[1:04:54] brother
[1:04:56] on paragraph number 30 I say I would
[1:04:59] like to tell you
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; here is where it lays.
[1:05:04] M
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; he don't want me to say this but my
[1:05:07] brother sitting here
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; brother Brham is now letting go the
[1:05:11] secret
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; he says yes there is a secret of how I
[1:05:16] can keep on the anointing
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; from day after day meeting after meeting
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; here is the secret he then says the
[1:05:25] brother does not want me to say this but
[1:05:27] because you've asked me I will tell you
[1:05:30] he says is
[1:05:34] uh uh J God that boy don't touch bread
[1:05:39] or water for days fasting and
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; pray
[1:05:44] uh he he has sent Peter these other
[1:05:48] brother uh
[1:05:51] sitting here by you them men lay on
[1:05:55] their face without food and water when I
[1:05:58] am in a meeting praying for me.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; That's where it comes from. My God.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; So whatever was happening
[1:06:09] to brother meeting after meeting it was
[1:06:13] the result of some prayer.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Brother God and Taylor when they knew
[1:06:20] about meetings they would fast.
[1:06:23] They would pray. Say Lord help our
[1:06:27] brother William Brandon. Help our
[1:06:29] prophet give him strength and upon the
[1:06:32] basis of their prayer. God answers
[1:06:34] prayer brothers.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Very unusual was happening to the
[1:06:40] prophet.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; What was it? Was his prayer? No.
[1:06:46] Someone was praying.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Some brother and he knew.
[1:06:51] Amen. It's because of brother God and
[1:06:54] brother Taylor.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wish we had brothers like that.
[1:06:58] I wish we had sisters like that.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; The success of every church, we must be
[1:07:06] be best on someone who is praying.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we as preachers, we wonder how
[1:07:17] things are happen. Someone is praying.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Somebody's praying somewhere.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "Lord, help our preacher. help
[1:07:26] our pastor. Huh?
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; You see things happen, it is because of
[1:07:30] prayer.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; So your prayer
[1:07:36] is very very
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; important.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Don't undervalue yourself and undervalue
[1:07:45] your prayer.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[1:07:57] when I when I I saw that quotation,
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, help me."
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That there are people that
[1:08:08] understands,
[1:08:10] people that know the power of prayer.
[1:08:16] Amen. The moment the meetings are
[1:08:19] announced,
[1:08:20] brother God and brother Taylor always
[1:08:24] pray,
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; you fast, eat nothing, praying for the
[1:08:28] meetings, praying for brother and
[1:08:31] because of that people would wonder
[1:08:33] where is he getting this strength
[1:08:35] meeting after meeting
[1:08:37] as a result of prayer.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[1:08:46] It's important to pray. There's a power
[1:08:49] behind a believer's prayer.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brother, sister?
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] You pray for me
[1:08:59] and I'll pray for you.
[1:09:04] You pray for me.
[1:09:08] I'll pray for you.
[1:09:11] You pray for me and I pray for you.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, why don't you pray for me?
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[1:09:30] the burdens are too hard to bear.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; What changes the trajectory? Prayer.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:40] Let's stop talking too much.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Let's stop complaining too much.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Let's stop remembering too much.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; What must we do?
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Pray.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Pray.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; A praying church
[1:09:56] is a successful church. Amen.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Was
[1:10:03] no matter what the devil did. Remember
[1:10:06] Jesus Christ said to Peter as I close
[1:10:12] Simon Simon
[1:10:15] the devil
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; it desire to sift you a sweet
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; but what did Jesus do
[1:10:24] he says but I have prayed for you
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; so Peter did not know
[1:10:33] if Jesus had not prayed for
[1:10:36] Peter was going to be sifted.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; But prayer changes things.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Prayer is the answer.

[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; things happen.

[1:11:15] during the squeeze imagine
[1:11:18] was squeeze is going is going to come
[1:11:20] coming.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; The good part about squeeze
[1:11:27] is you show what is inside you.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:11:32] It's not persecution.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's squeeze.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; If if you are not sure, if you're not
[1:11:40] sure whether this is a lemon or an
[1:11:43] orange,
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; what do you do? Get something that is
[1:11:46] sharp.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Pierce. Squeeze.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Something sharp. Pierce. Squeeze.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Squeeze is coming, my brother.
[1:11:57] When you squeeze,
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; something will come out.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Taste it.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; If it is sweet,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; it's
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; orange.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; If it is sour,
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; it's lemon.
[1:12:16] So will do that. But during that time,
[1:12:21] how many? When you hear about something
[1:12:24] happening to someone, brotherh,
[1:12:27] what do you do?
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; While you're praying, you can hear the
[1:12:34] knock
[1:12:37] the police right by your doorstep.
[1:12:40] We are looking for those people that
[1:12:42] believe this message nonsense.
[1:12:46] They've got booklets and all that. They
[1:12:49] believe in William Brham as their
[1:12:50] prophet. Uh you say yes you are at the
[1:12:53] right place I am one of them. She said
[1:12:56] go to the van quickly to the police
[1:12:58] camp. You answer your case right at the
[1:13:01] police camp there.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; This is where barriers will be broken.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; All camps will be broken.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; You can't say I belong to this one. Oh
[1:13:11] oh oh wait for speed.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; You'll be in the same van.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And in the same cell
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; and see Christ our redeemer died on the
[1:13:20] cross. When I see the blood pass over
[1:13:23] you
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; you sing right there and angels will
[1:13:26] come downh
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; and he says during that time what the
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; When everything else will herald we will
[1:13:42] try and stop everything. But what's the
[1:13:45] power that is inside the believer?
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; You travel like a thought.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; You say I'm going to Kimberly. You don't
[1:13:53] need no train. Don't need no bus. You
[1:13:55] don't need no plane.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Travel like a thought. You're in
[1:14:00] Kimberly.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Say you can't travel unless you have
[1:14:07] this that that you've got the power.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; You got the power in the name of Jesus.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Though Satan rag Jesus,
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; we cannot be defeated.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; These things are with us.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you undervalue yourself.
[1:14:27] There's a power inside you. It needs to
[1:14:30] be ignited.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; When certain things happen, it ignites
[1:14:33] the power.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Imagine Saint John Mark, they didn't
[1:14:37] know that they they could pray and God
[1:14:40] answer immediately.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] The church gathered, prayed earnestly,
[1:14:45] and God answered that prayer and down
[1:14:48] came the angel to rescue Peter.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; If we don't meet on this other side,
[1:15:04] I I believe on that day.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; We shall meet. Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Never to party
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; anymore.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Stay blessed.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] Amen. You enjoyed that?
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; You enjoyed the word. Amen. The power of
[1:15:48] prayer.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:15:52] righteous man availth much.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you uh dear pastor.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; We really enjoyed that.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; I'm sure right now faith is stirred up.
[1:16:00] Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Now prayer is something like
[1:16:04] you know when somebody starts training
[1:16:06] you can't just train everything in one
[1:16:09] time
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; you start baby steps amen
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; so pray is something you go by stage you
[1:16:14] practice practice practice you pray pray
[1:16:17] you can never pray enough amen
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; that's what the prophet said so it's
[1:16:21] something that you do all the time
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; and therefore when you do it all the
[1:16:25] time now you have confidence when you
[1:16:27] pray
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; because it's a relationship
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; you are now talking you communicate
[1:16:31] ating with God is communication with you
[1:16:33] and God. Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; And as you're communicating with God and
[1:16:37] if you're doing it all the time, then
[1:16:38] when you have a need, your brother has a
[1:16:39] need, you have confidence to go and
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; And then if you know if you got anything
[1:16:44] wrong, you make it right. Amen.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; You you place your sins under the blood.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you know you can have
[1:16:51] confidence to go and ask him in prayer.
[1:16:54] The brother mentioned about Peter being
[1:16:56] bound there in prison when they bound
[1:16:58] him with chains. You might have a family
[1:17:00] member. You might have a loved one bound
[1:17:02] by spirits,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; bound with spiritual chains,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; by demon powers. That's right.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Satan's got them bound.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; But what the believers did there, they
[1:17:11] was praying without ceasing.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Instead of you complaining about the
[1:17:15] loved one, complaining about their
[1:17:16] family member, go and pray.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; And we know prayer can move the hand of
[1:17:22] God.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; We saw it in the life of Hezekiah.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; So if you praying for that family member
[1:17:27] by faith, Amen. You got to believe when
[1:17:29] you're praying.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you believe that as you're
[1:17:33] praying that bounds the same angel of
[1:17:35] God, what what what what got the angel
[1:17:38] of God to go down there? It was prayer.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; So the same angel of God is here. So as
[1:17:45] you praying for your loved one, the
[1:17:46] angel of God can move on the scene.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; So you can get the angel of God to go on
[1:17:51] the scene by your prayer. Amen. And when
[1:17:54] you pray, God is going to perform
[1:17:56] paradoxes.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Sometime it's unbelievable but it's
[1:17:59] true.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; You won't even believe what's happening
[1:18:03] but you're praying. Amen. We believe
[1:18:05] there's power in prayer. Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; So we're going to sing a few songs and
[1:18:10] we thank you brother for preaching.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; It's not by coincidence you preach this
[1:18:21] message. My family knows. Last night I
[1:18:23] asked them to do something. uh they know
[1:18:25] what it is and our seat was in line with
[1:18:27] what you're preaching this morning.

[1:18:31] things.
