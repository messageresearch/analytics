[1:38] be praised this morning hallelujah amen
[1:41] we serve a good God Amen he's given us
[1:44] his word he's given us his truth amen
[1:48] and most of all he placed within us a c
[1:51] Gene amen that's why we can believe this
[1:53] word amen praise the
[1:56] Lord amen so this morning we're going to
[1:59] look into the word of God Amen we'll
[2:01] turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 13 so it's
[2:04] been a while I wanted to speak on this
[2:06] thought amen but I've been building up
[2:07] to this point
[2:09] amen we've always been talking about the
[2:12] eye dimensions of the Holy Ghost amen
[2:14] this morning I want to speak on a
[2:16] three-dimensional being talking about
[2:19] ourselves now a three-dimensional being
[2:22] faith hope and
[2:24] charity which is the essence of love
[2:27] amen this is the god man we are talking
[2:29] about
[2:30] amen not a man operating by faith alone
[2:33] but we are three-dimensional being
[2:34] operating with faith hope and charity
[2:38] amen 1 Corinthians chapter
[2:40] 13 praise the
[2:43] Lord we'll read from uh verse 13 there
[2:47] and now abideth faith hope and
[2:52] charity these three but the greatest of
[2:56] these is Charity amen we know the
[3:00] prophet of God says that word means love
[3:02] amen
[3:04] so now abide at faith hope charity these
[3:09] three but the greatest of these is
[3:12] Charity the Lord had blessings to the
[3:14] reading of his word you may be
[3:19] seated praise the Lord
[3:23] amen amen before we get into the sermon
[3:26] I just want to make some comments
[3:28] amen that there's nothing in your life
[3:31] or in our lives or in the
[3:33] world that will happen or that we can
[3:35] face or go through that will take God by
[3:40] surprise
[3:42] amen God is the designer of Our
[3:45] Lives amen God says that I know the
[3:49] plans I have for you amen so we may be
[3:52] taken by surprise that circumstances and
[3:55] events that are transpiring around us
[3:56] and what's happening in our lives but
[3:58] nothing takes God by
[3:59] [Music]
[4:01] surprise amen he knows the end from the
[4:05] beginning and I'm glad I serve a God
[4:07] Like That amen so when when I'm praying
[4:10] to him for an answer he already knows
[4:12] the end result praise the Lord so if my
[4:15] prayer is not in line with the end
[4:17] result is going to make me come into His
[4:20] will and his plan and purpose to achieve
[4:23] the end result that he wants to have for
[4:25] us amen so we find here amen even in the
[4:28] natural the prophet says if you want to
[4:31] know what time of day it is you look at
[4:34] a normal watch if you want to look at
[4:36] the prophetic eye and see prophecies
[4:39] through Through The Eyes Of God he says
[4:41] you watch
[4:43] Israel how many of you have read that
[4:46] Israel is God's time piece the prophet
[4:48] of God says and the prophet uh the Bible
[4:51] says that when you see the fctory start
[4:54] to put forth its but amen now I want you
[4:58] to know Israel is not putting forth buds
[5:00] at the moment buds started there in 1948
[5:04] right amen she's now
[5:07] mature country that's right a mature
[5:10] Army amen that is not afraid yes amen if
[5:14] you know something about Israel they are
[5:15] fearless that's right amen and the body
[5:18] of Jesus Christ is a Fearless Army we've
[5:20] got to drive out all doubt and fear now
[5:22] come on amen amen can you imagine Israel
[5:26] she's surrounded by Arab Nations yeah do
[5:29] you think she can operate by
[5:31] fear but if you watch her attack she's
[5:35] fearless so we find the seven front war
[5:37] of Israel I'll just tell you what the
[5:39] prime minister of Israel said they are
[5:41] fighting against amas in
[5:42] Gaza esbah in
[5:45] Lebanon the uis in Yemen the shiat
[5:48] milita in Iraq and Syria the terrorists
[5:51] in Judea and Samaria and
[5:54] Iran now why Iran is important he goes
[5:58] on to say that Iran is be the seventh
[6:01] front war against
[6:04] Israel and who is
[6:06] Iran Iran is
[6:09] Persia am if you go and Google it you'll
[6:12] see that Iran is called the Islamic
[6:15] Republic of Iran but they are also known
[6:17] as Persia and if you go to Daniel 10:12
[6:21] you'll see here then he said to me fear
[6:23] not Daniel for from the first day that
[6:26] thou did set thine heart to understand
[6:28] and to chasten thyself before thy God
[6:30] thy words were heard and I am come for
[6:34] thy
[6:35] words but the prince of the kingdom of
[6:38] Persia with stod me one and 12 days but
[6:42] L Michael one of the chief princes came
[6:45] to help me and I remained there with the
[6:48] kings of
[6:50] Persia amen so who is that demon
[6:55] powers demon powers had got into the
[6:57] King of Persia right
[7:00] amen if you read Isaiah 14 you'll see
[7:02] demon powers in another king Hallelujah
[7:05] so we know that the countries of this
[7:07] world some of you are looking very at
[7:10] least say an amen at least I know you're
[7:11] alive amen praise the
[7:14] Lord demon powers have possessed the
[7:16] kings of the Earth right amen they are
[7:19] operating through the kings of the earth
[7:22] amen hallelujah so amen even as we look
[7:24] into the word this morning we want to be
[7:27] that Fearless Army amen that army that
[7:30] is Invincible we know the prophet didn't
[7:32] say things amen just to prophesy fancy
[7:36] words amen but when he said she'll be an
[7:39] invincible Army that means we are an
[7:42] invincible
[7:44] Army so we're looking at this morning if
[7:47] you can put up you're having problems
[7:49] with
[7:51] your
[7:56] amen we're going to read statue of a
[7:58] perfect man amen if you can get the
[8:00] screen fixed statue of a perfect man
[8:02] will go to paragraph 354 I want to get
[8:05] this as a basis and I'm not going to try
[8:07] and Rush the
[8:08] sermon because if we complete the sermon
[8:12] today you probably will go home and have
[8:14] supper amen praise the Lord so we just
[8:17] want to try and lay some foundational
[8:18] truths here regarding amen what we are
[8:21] speaking about amen amen so remember at
[8:25] the end of the service I want you to
[8:27] understand that we are preaching that
[8:30] you can't exist in this world with faith
[8:32] alone that's what we are saying right
[8:36] we're going to read First Corinthians
[8:37] chapter 13 again and show you that the
[8:39] man operating with faith to move
[8:41] mountains can be
[8:44] nothing that's First Corinthians say
[8:46] that though I afraid to move mountains I
[8:49] am
[8:49] nothing right so afraid to move
[8:52] mountains Mark 11:23 alone you can't
[8:54] operate with faith alone to operate in
[8:57] that Dimension there's got to be a high
[9:00] power so that's why I'm preaching a
[9:02] three-dimensional being faith hope
[9:06] charity which is the essence of
[9:08] love amen are you still having problems
[9:13] what did you
[9:14] get hey it's it's
[9:18] working so then put up statue of a
[9:20] perfect man paragraph 354 amen praise
[9:23] the
[9:24] Lord hallelujah I'm just waiting for him
[9:27] to get to that paragraph because I want
[9:28] you to follow what the prophet is saying
[9:30] here amen praise the Lord so he says in
[9:34] every in each age God has placed these
[9:37] things talking about these things
[9:39] talking about a statue of a perfect man
[9:41] right the faith virtue knowledge
[9:42] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[9:44] kindness
[9:46] charity so he has placed these things
[9:48] into the church and patented it by
[9:51] showing that each individual has these
[9:55] amen right so you can't be an individual
[9:58] who doesn't possess the
[10:00] things right and this being when it's
[10:04] completed is the Church of God going to
[10:07] Rapture
[10:09] amen so a man who has all of these
[10:11] virtues is the man that God is going to
[10:15] Rapture and this being and completed is
[10:18] a servant of God amen amen praise the
[10:24] Lord in the church so now he's not
[10:27] talking only about the church he's
[10:29] talking about the individual becomes a
[10:31] servant in the Church of
[10:33] God right I see Satan is giving you hard
[10:36] time here Glory see what I mean there
[10:39] you are there's the full thing is that
[10:42] your cable or is it
[10:46] uh amen praise the Lord so let's just go
[10:50] down to the next one there I want to
[10:52] complete this before I go
[10:54] on he says here coming man Paul laying a
[10:58] foundation I began to pour in onto
[11:03] it the next one poured this now I don't
[11:06] if you know what I said how does how is
[11:08] fullness
[11:11] measured by overflow so they couldn't
[11:14] have ped halfway Paul had to fill Faith
[11:17] to it brim then IR could fill in poured
[11:20] in the next one poured this next one
[11:22] poured that and that and on down till it
[11:24] comes to the last agage but what it is
[11:27] it is the same spirit amen The Same
[11:30] Spirit that dwells in me says hands
[11:33] reach after that case the same spirit
[11:35] says feet make a step see what I mean
[11:38] then the whole stature of your being is
[11:40] governed and controlled by these things
[11:42] but it cannot be completely controlled
[11:45] till it completely possesses these
[11:51] qualities I me if you understand what
[11:53] he's saying the Holy Ghost can't fully
[11:55] control you unless you possess all of
[11:58] these qualities
[12:00] amen hallelujah so if we are talking
[12:03] about getting into higher dimensions of
[12:04] the Holy Ghost we've got to be certain
[12:07] that all of these qualities exist in us
[12:09] to be controlled by the Holy Ghost amen
[12:13] praise the Lord amen amen we'll come
[12:16] back to that now praise the
[12:19] Lord is it all your things or is it just
[12:22] one you can go to my notes amen you can
[12:24] go to my notes there praise the Lord
[12:31] praise the
[12:33] Lord let's get to that first uh in faith
[12:36] is a substance the prophet says faith is
[12:39] the substance of things hoped for the
[12:41] evidence of Things Not Seen let's take
[12:44] that part of the scripture the substance
[12:46] of things hope
[12:47] for there's three things hope charity
[12:51] and faith is that right hope is one
[12:54] Element faith is another element and
[12:58] charity is is another
[13:00] element charity is love I've seen many
[13:03] people come by lovely people real
[13:06] Christians but didn't have enough Faith
[13:08] to be healed and some sinner passed by
[13:12] and has the faith to be healed see it's
[13:15] another element all together now don't
[13:18] miss
[13:19] that faith is a powerful Dimension amen
[13:23] but he says the charity love is another
[13:26] element all together
[13:30] it's not how well you serve God it's an
[13:32] element can we close the door amen it's
[13:34] an element that you possess
[13:37] Yourself Praise the Lord amen amen it's
[13:40] an element you possess yourself yes amen
[13:45] amen now I want you to see this because
[13:47] it's for your benefit so the prophet is
[13:50] splitting these things now I want you to
[13:52] also understand that hope is very
[13:54] important most people discredit hope but
[13:57] the Bible says there are three
[13:59] things how many if you read it 1
[14:01] Corinthians
[14:03] 13:13 there is faith hope and
[14:06] charity but the greatest of these is
[14:10] Charity now what is
[14:13] hope faith is a substance of things hope
[14:15] for meaning if there was no hope there
[14:18] Faith can't have a
[14:20] work so hope is your
[14:24] desire hope is your desire for the
[14:26] things of God hope is your desire for
[14:29] healing based on the word of God but
[14:31] Faith goes into action and it puts it
[14:34] amen into Play Amen hope is looking for
[14:37] it coming In A Time Amen in the future
[14:40] the prophet says and he says sometimes
[14:43] if you don't be careful you can operate
[14:45] in the element of Hope alone thinking
[14:47] it's
[14:48] Faith right he says but when faith comes
[14:51] along it gets a hold of your desire and
[14:55] it says that it's already received amen
[14:58] amen so the promise that was given the
[15:01] hope that was given to Abraham is you're
[15:03] going to have a
[15:04] son but Abraham's Faith made him see
[15:08] beyond the physical that he couldn't
[15:10] have a
[15:12] child so he took the
[15:15] Hope yes amen amen let's put Hope Chest
[15:19] there Amen in your message search you
[15:22] can search hope chest and just search it
[15:24] for a specific word not a broad search
[15:27] amen praise the Lord while we on amen if
[15:29] the spirit is bringing this let's bring
[15:30] this out amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[15:35] so here's Abraham he has this Faith amen
[15:38] his faith is based on what God's word
[15:40] told him that he's going to have a son
[15:43] praise the
[15:44] Lord he says thank God we'll have it go
[15:47] ahead make their little booties and get
[15:49] the little jacket ready get all the bird
[15:52] eyeon pins CU we're going to have it
[15:54] that's right I'm expecting it that's
[15:56] right put them in your Hope Chest get
[15:59] ready cuz it's going to cuz it's coming
[16:02] amen yes Lord thank you Lord thank you
[16:06] Lord so faith has got to have a basis to
[16:08] work and the Bible says in Hebrews 11
[16:11] faith is the substance of things hoped
[16:14] for yes amen I gave you this example
[16:16] before and they say this morning again
[16:18] if you desire that's your hope now to
[16:20] build this
[16:21] ppit right you need raw material to
[16:24] build this
[16:26] ppit so Faith becomes your raw material
[16:28] aterial your raw material to build a
[16:31] ppit is
[16:34] wood okay but in your heart you desire
[16:37] you have this hope to build a
[16:39] ppit but you need the raw material which
[16:42] is f to make the pulpit the same way
[16:45] anything you desire in your
[16:47] heart the hope you have in your
[16:49] heart it requires Faith to bring it into
[16:52] this Dimension amenu Faith makes it
[16:56] happen praise the Lord yes amen is
[16:59] everybody understanding that because
[17:02] there must be faith hope and charity if
[17:04] you are a hopeless person then you'll be
[17:06] a bum on the street that's a person
[17:08] without hope with no ambition no
[17:11] goal amen
[17:14] hallelujah so I'm saying build your Hope
[17:17] on things Eternal we sing that song amen
[17:20] amen didn't Paul say Christ in me the
[17:23] hope of
[17:25] glory I'm just trying to kill that thing
[17:27] where people just want to credit
[17:29] hope hope as long as it's a god-given
[17:32] desire Christ the hope of glory faith
[17:35] can push it to another level and bring
[17:37] it to pass amen
[17:41] hallelujah so the next p i want to show
[17:43] you this now where we getting this
[17:44] thought from and the prophet says watch
[17:47] this is now in the message you swore by
[17:50] himself
[17:51] amen the next one there he says watch
[17:54] three everything in the Bible is a three
[17:58] three blends to a one see father son
[18:02] Holy Spirit not three Gods right we
[18:05] understand that he says one watch he
[18:08] takes the next part now he says faith
[18:10] hope charity not three different
[18:16] things but all the essence of one amen
[18:20] [Music]
[18:22] love amen so we can't be saying amen
[18:26] that we are operating as an individual
[18:28] unit just based on faith or just on Hope
[18:31] or just on love you can have love and no
[18:34] faith praise the Lord you can have faith
[18:37] and no
[18:38] love praise the Lord you can have faith
[18:40] based on no
[18:42] hope so your faith is based on
[18:45] nothing but he says these three function
[18:47] is one
[18:49] unit and it's the essence of one love
[18:53] that is why I titled it amen that a
[18:56] three-dimensional being Faith open
[18:58] charity is the essence of
[19:01] Love Hallelujah you know what the
[19:03] essence is it's the being amen it's what
[19:06] what it consist of the essence amen
[19:09] praise the
[19:10] Lord and and if you remember a few weeks
[19:13] ago maybe even a month or so ago I asked
[19:15] you if you reach perfect faith is that
[19:17] it how many of you remember me asking
[19:19] you and I asked you to say can there be
[19:22] an enlargement past that perfect
[19:25] Faith because love is in a higher
[19:28] dimension yes amen because faith is at
[19:30] the
[19:32] foundation but love comes at the
[19:34] Capstone and I want to show you that
[19:36] that love is not from the
[19:40] earth the capping stone is not from the
[19:42] earth amen praise the
[19:45] Lord love is a higher Dimension than
[19:48] Faith so which means that love is the
[19:50] god Dimension coming to the Earth love
[19:53] is the god Dimension coming upon each
[19:54] and every one of us so when we say we
[19:57] love somebody when the god Kind of Love
[19:59] Comes upon us it is not talking about
[20:01] fil Your Love have I have an affection
[20:04] for brother rames so I love him no I I'm
[20:07] talking about a guppy love that whether
[20:09] he loves me back or not I love him
[20:12] whether he does bad to me or not I love
[20:15] him
[20:16] amen than you Lord so love is not based
[20:18] on
[20:20] conditions sir I'm talking about God's
[20:22] kind of love our human love is maybe if
[20:25] you love me I'll love you back if you
[20:27] scratch my back I'll Str your back but
[20:30] the god Kind of Love is totally
[20:31] different amen yes amen so when we are
[20:36] talking about Frontiers opening up to us
[20:40] spiritual Frontiers opening up to us we
[20:42] were talking about a territory that we
[20:44] need to possess which is love which is
[20:48] Charity it's a territory that needs to
[20:50] be opened up to us because it'll change
[20:53] our lives in the way we we are as
[20:55] Christians amen there there's a frontier
[20:58] we need to open up and when we're
[21:00] talking about the opening up of
[21:01] spiritual Frontiers let us say this
[21:03] morning Lord open to us the frontier of
[21:06] love amen open to us the frontier of
[21:09] Charity
[21:11] hallelujah praise the Lord let's enlarge
[21:14] our borders past Faith am because some
[21:17] of us have had Faith where we've done
[21:19] incredible
[21:21] things we've had Faith to move mountains
[21:24] amen can you say amen amen praise the
[21:27] Lord
[21:31] now you notice that most time when the
[21:33] sermon is preached people don't go past
[21:35] Brotherly
[21:37] Love they talk about the coming down of
[21:40] Charity as a future
[21:42] event Hallelujah they just talk about
[21:45] brotherly love being here in the latan
[21:47] church
[21:48] age but I want you to know without that
[21:50] final step that man is not complete
[21:54] right and if you read the quote we said
[21:58] he said all of these virtues need to be
[22:00] in
[22:01] us to go in the Rapture am amen
[22:05] hallelujah amen so it doesn't come after
[22:09] the
[22:10] Rapture it's got to come before the
[22:12] Rapture amen and I'm saying Satan's
[22:14] deception will be to make you think it's
[22:17] a future thing coming when the thing has
[22:19] already come and you don't know it I'm
[22:22] saying if we don't know it his deception
[22:25] will be to keep us looking at a thing
[22:27] coming
[22:30] praise the
[22:31] Lord so when we are talking about
[22:33] brotherly love we are talking about the
[22:35] Philadelphia Corridor because
[22:37] Philadelphia means brotherly love
[22:39] everybody agree you read The Prophet's
[22:40] message Philadelphia means brotherly
[22:43] love it's a Greek
[22:44] word so we are talking about that
[22:47] Philadelphia
[22:49] Corridor so how are we going to attain
[22:51] and how are we going to get God's
[22:53] dimension of love come down upon us
[22:56] there's got to be a corridor that leads
[22:58] us to this amen amen and it's the
[23:02] Philadelphia
[23:03] Corridor because Jesus said by this
[23:06] shall all men know that you are my
[23:08] disciples if you have love one for
[23:10] another amen so in order for you to
[23:13] reach that God love
[23:16] Dimension brotherly love there's got to
[23:18] be a bridge to move you past brotherly
[23:23] love and go on to meet
[23:28] agape love I'm trying to break it down
[23:31] amen that we can understand this we
[23:33] can't be stuck in brotherly love because
[23:35] your Brotherly Love still makes you not
[23:37] forgive your
[23:39] brother brotherly love seems to be amen
[23:42] people can't fellowship with one another
[23:45] yet we say we have Brotherly Love now
[23:47] let me ask you to In This Way in every
[23:49] age every virtue the prophet says every
[23:52] age they poured it into it right so Paul
[23:54] would have poured Faith the apostles
[23:56] Faith irus would have poured the next
[23:58] virtue everybody understand amen was it
[24:01] their
[24:02] strength was it their strength or was it
[24:05] exposing their weakness Faith was their
[24:08] strength virtue was their
[24:11] strength right each age that was their
[24:14] strength amen so how can it be that in
[24:18] the age of the latest year and church
[24:20] age brotherly love is not the
[24:23] strength that it's hard for people to
[24:25] fellowship with one
[24:27] another I say we tear down
[24:29] walls I say Amen that God didn't come to
[24:32] build a message Church the message of
[24:35] the hour came to build up the body of
[24:36] Christ and we need to start separating
[24:39] from church names Church IDE ideologies
[24:42] I'm talking about within the framework
[24:43] of the message we've got to be one Army
[24:46] one body amen rising up in this hour we
[24:49] can't be amen isolated Behind the Walls
[24:51] of our church name amen God has called a
[24:53] body of Christ in this hour brother
[24:55] Brandon would have been so against it
[24:57] amen
[24:58] Amen to see the barriers and the
[25:00] denominations we have built around
[25:02] ourselves amen we have one message with
[25:05] one Prophet amen with one Divine
[25:07] interpretation so there can't be so many
[25:10] different men of God saying I see this
[25:12] way I see it that way amen these men of
[25:15] God need to come back to the Altar and
[25:17] see it God's way you can't tell me you
[25:20] had one Prophet with one Revelation and
[25:22] you see it all different ways something
[25:24] is wrong and I told you again amen don't
[25:27] come to me with your elephant the oh I'm
[25:30] feeling the trunk I'm feeling the leg
[25:33] I'm feeling the tail I'm feeling the
[25:35] ears I thought we had the full opening
[25:36] of the word you're supposed to be seeing
[25:38] the full elephant why you seeing the
[25:40] trunk only which means the opening of
[25:41] the word hasn't been open to
[25:44] you somebody say Amen if you're seeing
[25:47] the trunk only something wrong need to
[25:50] come up high your bird's eye view you'll
[25:51] see the whole
[25:52] elephant praise the Lord
[25:56] amen so we are moving in this place
[25:58] called a Philadelphia Corridor and
[26:01] that's why it's a corridor we got to
[26:02] protect Brotherly
[26:04] Love which means you can't listen to
[26:07] something about your brother or
[26:09] sister if we are saying we are
[26:11] protecting that border we can't listen
[26:13] to gossip yes amen we can't be listening
[26:16] to things that are tearing down
[26:18] people amen if we are going to protect
[26:21] the border the moment those things arise
[26:24] we pray about it and you tell the person
[26:26] carrying that tail that we are praying
[26:28] about
[26:30] it this is not the hour to tear down and
[26:33] pull down people hallelujah oh yes
[26:37] yes if we are really serious about the
[26:39] God
[26:40] Dimension charity coming down upon us
[26:44] amen we've got to walk this Philadelphia
[26:47] Corridor that leads us to a gape
[26:51] love the corridor and the passageway
[26:54] must be projected why in the natural the
[26:56] Philadelphia corridor in Israel is
[26:59] protecting them from taking the hostages
[27:03] back to
[27:06] Egypt we know Egypt types the world so
[27:09] the corridor becomes an important
[27:11] section that we've got to protect it to
[27:13] keep spiritual captives from going back
[27:16] into the world if we demonize and we
[27:19] speak bad against our own Brothers amen
[27:21] we can kill their spirit and influence
[27:23] amen that they want to backslide and get
[27:25] back into the world demon powers can
[27:27] take them captive
[27:31] our job is to release the captives
[27:35] amen praise the Lord
[27:40] than so we we find that faith we know is
[27:43] a God's substance we are not talking
[27:46] about your natural faith in
[27:49] things the Apostle Paul in Galatians
[27:53] 220 amen if you can put it up let's read
[27:57] it
[27:58] Hallelujah Galatians 2 and2 if we read
[28:02] the
[28:03] Scripture it says I am crucified with
[28:09] Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but
[28:12] Christ liveth in me that's the kind of
[28:15] Glory we're talking about amen when he's
[28:18] when he's living in you and the glory is
[28:20] being seen through you then you become
[28:22] the banner that is raised in this hour
[28:24] you become n that is raised in this hour
[28:27] amen
[28:28] and the life which I now live in the
[28:31] flesh I live by my own
[28:35] faith who's reading this I live by the
[28:40] faith of the Son of God so if we're
[28:44] crucified with him which means we were
[28:46] perfected in him which means we were our
[28:49] Holiness is found in him which means our
[28:51] righteousness is found in him which
[28:53] means we operate by his
[28:56] faith it's not our human faith
[28:59] it's not me trying to work up my
[29:01] faith because a pure perfect word of God
[29:05] has come down I don't know if you can
[29:06] agree to that we have the message of the
[29:08] hour a pure perfect word and Faith
[29:12] cometh by the hearing of the word so if
[29:14] we are listening to a pure perfect word
[29:16] we've got to have a pure perfect Faith
[29:20] amen the
[29:23] faith I want brother Jeff to be a amen
[29:26] because you'll enjoy the sermon praise
[29:28] the
[29:29] Lord the faith of the Son of God who
[29:33] loved me and gave himself for me you
[29:37] know the prophet of God says it this way
[29:38] we got it in the quot somewh but I'm
[29:39] just going to paraphrase now he says
[29:42] when I saw what Jesus Christ did for me
[29:45] Jesus Christ conquered my heart and
[29:48] because he conquered my heart he took
[29:50] away all
[29:53] fear so I don't have to doubt his
[29:57] word I can rest upon his word that every
[30:00] promise in that book will come to pass
[30:02] so I approach every situation with that
[30:05] that it must come to pass all fear is
[30:07] taken away because I'm conquered by
[30:09] God's
[30:11] love another reading of Psalms 23 it
[30:14] says though I walk through the valley of
[30:15] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[30:18] it's another version when they say he
[30:19] says I fear no evil because I am already
[30:24] conquered if you have already been
[30:26] conquered how can some else conquer
[30:29] you amen praise the
[30:32] Lord let me say it this way when when a
[30:36] mother is to conceive if seed has
[30:39] already taken
[30:40] conception that whom he
[30:44] sealed praise the Lord so means nothing
[30:47] else can come
[30:48] there the same way amen he's saying yeah
[30:52] that I am already conquered by the love
[30:55] of Jesus
[30:56] Christ so Satan's fear can't conquer me
[31:00] so though I walk through the valley of
[31:01] the shadow of death I've already been
[31:03] conquered by Jesus
[31:05] Christ and nothing else can conquer
[31:09] me okay let me say it another way if
[31:12] Satan wants to conquer you he must
[31:15] conquer Jesus Christ because Jesus has
[31:17] conquered
[31:18] you which means you are not your own you
[31:21] belong to Jesus so for in order to Satan
[31:23] to conquer you he must conquer Jesus and
[31:26] he can never conquer Jesus
[31:31] I've already been conquered by Jesus I'm
[31:33] already taken a prisoner by Jesus so
[31:37] Satan can't have
[31:39] me praise the
[31:41] Lord so Faith gives us access we just
[31:44] showed you here now that the faith that
[31:46] we're operating is not our own faith
[31:48] that's the faith of Mark
[31:51] 11:23 praise the Lord when it says there
[31:54] in Mark 11 have the faith of God yes
[32:00] so we seeing that the access to Agape
[32:03] Love the agape love of Jesus is by the
[32:06] Holy Ghost right faith hope and charity
[32:09] the greatest of this is
[32:11] Charity so if I can say this way the
[32:14] prophet says perfect love will give you
[32:16] perfect Faith amen he says perfect love
[32:19] produces perfect
[32:21] Faith Hallelujah you know he goes on and
[32:23] he illustrates he says if I have perfect
[32:25] love for my wife when I'm going away I
[32:28] don't have to give her instruction
[32:30] listen here you Mrs genen when I'm gone
[32:33] don't you look at any other
[32:35] man don't be flirting around with any
[32:38] other man he says my love for her will
[32:41] give me confidence in her already that's
[32:43] why I married
[32:45] her that I don't have to now have this
[32:48] fear that now that I'm gone away she's
[32:50] going to be looking after other
[32:53] men praise the Lord he says what does
[32:57] that is perfect perfect love perfect
[32:59] love produces that Faith hallelujah
[33:04] amen
[33:05] so if I can say it this
[33:08] way that fa faith without love makes you
[33:15] nothing amen let's read it in the Bible
[33:19] 1 Corinthians chapter 13
[33:29] [Music]
[33:32] let's read from the first maybe some of
[33:34] the younger ones maybe never read this
[33:36] before or maybe you haven't read in a
[33:37] long time let's read it though I speak
[33:40] with tongues of men and angels and have
[33:42] not charity I am become a sounding brass
[33:45] or a tinkling
[33:49] symbol so that is now operating a
[33:51] prophetic gift I'm trying to break it
[33:53] down for you now you can operate a
[33:55] prophetic gift speaking in tongues
[33:58] all
[34:00] right but not charity he says you become
[34:03] a sounding brass tinkling symbol though
[34:06] I have the gift of
[34:08] Prophecy and understand all Mysteries
[34:11] I'm say we understand all
[34:15] Mysteries we come into the message of
[34:17] the hour we understand all Mysteries
[34:19] because Revelation 10:7 said the mystery
[34:21] of God will be finished so that does
[34:23] that put us in this category
[34:29] now as well Revelation 10:11 does he say
[34:32] we must prophesy
[34:34] again so that is this putting us in this
[34:37] category don't be afraid to be put in
[34:38] this category now amen because I'm going
[34:40] to show you that when it is activated it
[34:43] actually puts it on Amen it brings a
[34:45] super anointing upon
[34:47] you so this is now our category we have
[34:50] the gift of Prophecy and understand all
[34:52] mystery and all knowledge and though I
[34:54] have all Faith the Mark 11:23 men
[35:00] so that I could remove mountains and
[35:02] have not charity I am
[35:09] nothing so you can have faith without
[35:12] that and be
[35:14] nothing is that what the scripture is
[35:16] saying you can have these things and be
[35:19] nothing you can go on to read the rest
[35:21] I'm not dwelling on those points now I'm
[35:23] just dwelling on this one point so
[35:25] perfect faith
[35:28] so how do I have the faith of God is
[35:32] that love when I have a gape love when
[35:36] the Capstone comes upon my faith perfect
[35:38] faith it puts faith on
[35:42] steroids if I can say it that way
[35:47] amen it puts faith on steroids it brings
[35:51] down a super
[35:53] anointing hallelujah amen
[35:58] the Propet of God was walking through a
[35:59] field one
[36:01] day and he was going to pray for
[36:04] somebody and as he was walking along the
[36:06] field he saw this bull and you know how
[36:09] he dramatizes it that this was a killer
[36:13] bull now he had
[36:16] Faith oh yes first his human Faith went
[36:19] to his
[36:20] gun then he realized he left it in the
[36:23] car
[36:25] amen right
[36:28] then he says that something amen now
[36:32] something must happen because he's in
[36:34] the field he says this bull comes
[36:36] charging towards
[36:38] him so I'm showing you that he's trying
[36:40] to show us that faith alone wouldn't
[36:42] have done it in order for him to operate
[36:44] as the Adam man is what we want to
[36:47] operate as as an adopted son something
[36:51] else a super love to come upon him I'm
[36:53] trying to show you that love put his
[36:56] faith on steroids
[36:58] amen sorry for the lack of lack of a
[37:00] better word I'm trying to find a better
[37:01] word than
[37:03] that if you find a better word tell
[37:06] me amen praise the Lord so he's walking
[37:10] through this field this bull come
[37:12] charging at him and he says that he
[37:14] spoke to this
[37:16] bull now this is a Mark 11:23
[37:20] man but he spoke with love amen he
[37:24] didn't say you demon beast but
[37:28] he didn't call that Satan we blame
[37:30] everything on Satan that was a
[37:34] bull you
[37:37] know he said I spoke to the bull and he
[37:41] spoke to that bull with
[37:43] love now he says now most of us you'll
[37:47] know what I'm talking about when the dog
[37:49] is coming after you you're not speaking
[37:51] to that dog in
[37:53] love you got fear inside you know that
[37:55] fear dog please
[38:00] say there's fear in you how many of you
[38:03] felt that
[38:04] fear you're fearful now that's wasn't it
[38:07] wasn't operating like
[38:09] that he says when he spoke all fear was
[38:12] gone he spoke in love to the bull and he
[38:16] says I'm sorry this is your territory I
[38:18] came and Disturbed you I didn't mean to
[38:20] do that I was going to pray for
[38:23] somebody he says that bull stopped
[38:25] within 5T of him
[38:28] what he says what did it was
[38:32] love his love accompanied by his faith
[38:35] now remember if he didn't have faith he
[38:37] wouldn't have spoken to the bull he
[38:39] would have thought it's worthless to
[38:40] speak to the bull so that showed you his
[38:42] faith to speak but he said love Cast
[38:46] Away all
[38:47] fear
[38:49] amen amen praise the Lord
[38:53] amen so so love puts faith on steroids
[38:58] or maybe I can say it this way love
[39:00] turns Faith
[39:03] Supernatural love makes your faith
[39:06] Supernatural which means you're a
[39:08] natural
[39:09] being but there's a supernatural element
[39:12] comes inside of you which means you no
[39:15] longer walk by faith or sorry you no
[39:18] longer walk by
[39:19] sight you no longer walk after the flesh
[39:22] but you walk after the spirit you're
[39:24] walking after Faith amen amen praise the
[39:27] Lord we're going very slow amen I'm
[39:29] still on my first page
[39:30] here praise the
[39:33] Lord amen but I'm trying to bring it
[39:36] where everybody understands it even the
[39:37] young ones that when you are speaking by
[39:40] faith if you want to operate as a son
[39:42] and daughter of God fear must be removed
[39:46] that is why I've been getting you to
[39:47] pray before you start praying I reject
[39:49] all anxiety fear doubt Satan I reject
[39:53] your fear your doubt I cast it out of me
[39:56] clear the way now the channel for the
[39:59] Holy Spirit to
[40:00] move you start to make these
[40:03] confessions praise the Lord because
[40:06] remember you have the legal authority
[40:08] over your own
[40:09] body praise the Lord so so Faith now
[40:13] needs to operate through
[40:17] love praise the
[40:20] Lord is everybody getting that point
[40:23] your faith needs to operate through
[40:26] love praise praise the Lord amen so in
[40:29] everything that you are facing now in
[40:31] life coming for going forward let it be
[40:33] accompanied by
[40:37] love yes
[40:39] amen maybe you haven't considered that
[40:42] before but if you if you are praying for
[40:44] the sick don't just pray based on a
[40:49] certain idea that you have the prophet
[40:51] says that when you step into the shoe
[40:53] and you have compassion for that person
[40:55] amen you're praying out of love for this
[40:57] person amen Lord this is my brother in
[40:59] the body of Christ and Lord as one
[41:02] member in the body If It suffers oh God
[41:04] the entire body suffers and Lord I love
[41:06] my brother Lord Jesus and I'm praying
[41:08] now based upon your word that these
[41:10] signs shall follow them that believe if
[41:12] I lay hands upon the sick they shall
[41:14] recover Lord Jesus and Lord your word
[41:16] declares that by the stripes of Jesus
[41:19] they are healed oh
[41:21] God hallelujah you can you can pray with
[41:26] love your faith can be boosted by love
[41:30] amen now that wasn't the only time you
[41:33] know the prophet spoke to killer
[41:35] bees the bees also came after
[41:38] him and his faith didn't he didn't just
[41:41] speak the word you be go back to where
[41:43] you came
[41:45] from he attributed to the love spirit
[41:48] that came over
[41:49] [Music]
[41:51] him what does he attribute it to the
[41:54] love spirit that came over him he
[41:57] attributed it to that he doesn't say
[41:59] look at what great faith I
[42:01] have he said it was love he says when
[42:05] that man came that 200 lb man came there
[42:08] on the stage and he and he was hitting
[42:10] other
[42:11] preachers and other men were fearful of
[42:14] him even the policemen were scared of
[42:16] him brother Joshua shared an encounter
[42:18] where he experienced one of these guys
[42:20] demon possessed men and he was telling
[42:23] the prophet I'm going to break every
[42:25] bone in your body
[42:31] the prophet of God stood there with
[42:33] faith in his heart and compassion fell
[42:36] over him and he spoke to this man and he
[42:39] said you're going to bow at my feet and
[42:43] he said me bow at your
[42:45] feet and there he was down at the
[42:47] prophet's feet what will do it
[42:51] love because you can't be 40 years in
[42:54] the message now and not have been built
[42:56] up in faith Hallelujah so surely your
[42:58] faith must be built up you must have
[43:01] some Measure of
[43:03] Faith but I'm showing you that you can
[43:07] equip it with love to get the results
[43:11] that's
[43:12] required the Propet of God also
[43:14] encountering a vulgar situation where
[43:16] this young man and this young girl were
[43:18] sitting in the front row they had come
[43:19] there to tempt the spirit of
[43:22] God and they started to kiss one another
[43:27] and hold one
[43:28] another and they were so vulgar and the
[43:31] prophet of God would tell them don't do
[43:34] that don't do that and they wouldn't
[43:36] listen to
[43:38] him and he could have spoken a word of
[43:41] condemnation and death to them but he
[43:43] says a L's Spirit came over
[43:47] him and the spirit reminded him that
[43:50] this is a
[43:52] test and he turned to them and he says I
[43:56] forgive you
[43:58] yes they were sitting in the presence of
[44:01] the sh glory of
[44:03] God and love came down and
[44:07] [Music]
[44:08] forgave what what do you think was there
[44:11] at the boat when the prophet and the the
[44:13] fish guts was lying all over the
[44:21] place and he says little
[44:24] fishy I give you back your life
[44:27] [Music]
[44:28] amen
[44:31] amen praise the
[44:36] Lord I want you to know when Jesus came
[44:38] on the
[44:40] earth he didn't only come to reflect God
[44:44] on the Earth but he came to show you the
[44:47] type of man you were supposed to
[44:50] be he's called the second Adam
[44:53] yes so when you're reading anything
[44:56] about Jesus
[44:57] you must be able to see that that's
[44:59] supposed to be you you are supposed to
[45:01] be healing the blind man you are
[45:04] supposed to be the withed man's hand you
[45:06] were supposed to be healing the crippled
[45:08] you were supposed Jesus said Greater
[45:10] Works than these shall he
[45:14] do so Jesus didn't come to show you that
[45:17] I am far removed from all of you and you
[45:19] can't touch me and you can't do what I'm
[45:21] doing he came to show you as I do these
[45:24] things The Father loves you amen and I
[45:27] have come to pay the price for your
[45:29] Redemption that when you are fully
[45:31] redeemed and my blood is on that cross
[45:34] and my blood is is is accepted by the
[45:37] father and my sacrifice is
[45:41] accepted I am the man who can go and
[45:44] take back your title deed in Revelation
[45:47] 5 but I'm not a selfish
[45:50] person I'm going to bring it down back
[45:52] to you because Greater Love at no man
[45:56] than he that would lay down his life for
[45:58] his friends and Jesus Christ was not a
[46:01] selfish person the Bible says God so
[46:04] loved the world God conquers the world
[46:07] through love amen people want to try and
[46:10] Conquer through fear people want to try
[46:12] and Conquer through Atomic missiles and
[46:14] warfare but God conquers the world
[46:17] through love
[46:20] amen so in our situations that we will
[46:23] encounter and face can we approach it
[46:25] with love amen am can we conquer every
[46:28] situation with love amen when when the
[46:31] husband says something that's not
[46:33] convenient to your ears you're not used
[46:35] to it can you approach it with love out
[46:37] of rather than anger can you do the same
[46:39] thing when your wife says something back
[46:41] to you and you can you approach it with
[46:43] love rather than
[46:46] anger so the prophet of God you know
[46:49] amen so many times he would bring this
[46:52] example there was a woman sitting there
[46:54] she he says that a top was exposed her
[46:56] shoulders and all of these
[46:59] things and he gave her his
[47:02] coat what did that love sister be
[47:05] respectful in the house of God just
[47:07] cover
[47:09] yourself she took that coat and she
[47:11] flung it she rejected love right and he
[47:14] says if this is what you call religion I
[47:17] don't even want it for my pet
[47:20] cow and you know what happened to
[47:23] her she ended up on a dead bed crying
[47:27] out for the man of
[47:30] God so the prophet was projecting love
[47:34] amen what does the prophet preach a
[47:36] message when Divine love is projected
[47:39] Sovereign Grace takes
[47:42] over what happened to that woman amen
[47:45] I'm not even in my message right now but
[47:47] what happened to that woman that was
[47:49] dragged there caught in the very Act of
[47:52] adultery
[47:57] caught in the very Act of
[47:59] adultery you can be caught in the very
[48:01] Act of drinking smoking you can be
[48:04] caught in the very Act of Amen
[48:07] committing sin
[48:10] fornication
[48:12] pornography caught in the very act but
[48:15] the grace of Jesus is here this morning
[48:18] amen amen yes you are dragged before
[48:23] Jesus this morning
[48:27] and what did Jesus
[48:30] do Jesus loved
[48:34] her and he wrote something in the
[48:36] [Music]
[48:38] sand and the Bible says that he asked
[48:40] those men that were standing there with
[48:42] rocks in their hand ready to Stone
[48:45] her okay yall can Stone her but I want
[48:49] the first person that's without sin to
[48:51] [Music]
[48:53] start
[48:55] amen they started to drop their
[48:59] Stones they all started to drop their
[49:02] stones and Jesus said women where are
[49:05] thine accusers the head must have been
[49:07] down in the sand she looks around she
[49:10] sees no man but Jesus
[49:13] am oh thank you Lord he says neither do
[49:16] I condemn you am go and sin no
[49:19] more thank you the same Grace is being
[49:22] extended to you this morning thank you
[49:24] Lord whatever you are doing in your life
[49:25] whatever situation you are caught up in
[49:28] you are coming before the throne room of
[49:30] Jesus right now you are caught up into
[49:32] his presence right now amen because we
[49:35] are seated together in Heavenly places
[49:37] and I ask you where are thine accusers
[49:39] amen Satan th adversary who has accused
[49:42] you of sin Jesus Christ blood has
[49:44] covered you from all sin but you've got
[49:46] to accept it you've got to accept his
[49:49] free will thank you Lord you've got to
[49:51] accept his grace and his pardon amen
[49:53] amen praise the Lord
[50:01] thank
[50:04] amen so we said faith is believing
[50:07] something before it happens faith is
[50:10] based on the promise of God's
[50:14] word now we know what faith
[50:18] is and I'm going to say it like this
[50:21] Faith requires something in return
[50:26] put up Hebrews
[50:29] 11 Faith doesn't work
[50:32] independently Faith requires a
[50:35] return I don't if you know
[50:40] that Faith requires that whatever it's
[50:43] believing in it must come to pass so
[50:46] Faith requires something in
[50:49] return it says your faith is a substance
[50:53] of things
[50:55] hopeful the evidence of Things Not
[50:58] Seen we know further down in this
[51:00] chapter it says without faith it's
[51:02] impossible to please God right now Faith
[51:07] is the substance of things hoped
[51:10] for so faith can only work with whatever
[51:13] desire is in your heart so if you have
[51:16] the desire of God's word for healing
[51:18] faith can only take that what you hope
[51:21] in your
[51:21] heart the scripture the desire in your
[51:24] heart and it becomes the
[51:27] substance
[51:29] amen amen
[51:33] am Romans
[51:35] [Music]
[51:37] 4:17 amen we won't be much longer we're
[51:39] going to close now because I like I said
[51:42] I'm laying a foundation for something
[51:43] and I don't want you to miss amen the
[51:46] Simplicity of it by speaking too
[51:51] long this is now as this is talking
[51:54] about Abraham and God right showing you
[51:57] how God had had worked on Abraham's
[52:00] heart and he brought him to a condition
[52:02] where this man Abraham started to speak
[52:05] like
[52:05] [Music]
[52:07] God he says as it is written I have made
[52:10] the a father of many nations before him
[52:14] whom he believed even God who quickened
[52:17] the dead and called those things which
[52:19] be not as though they were amen you see
[52:24] what faith does it calls things which
[52:25] are not as as though they
[52:28] are praise the Lord amen that's how
[52:31] powerful faith
[52:32] is Faith can make you if you are
[52:34] Desiring maybe you have a hope or a
[52:36] desire in your heart for a car Faith
[52:38] sees it that you already have it faith
[52:41] will make you go buy a keying that even
[52:43] though you don't have the finances for
[52:44] the car you're showing God your faith
[52:47] and you say I have faith enough I'm
[52:48] going to buy this key ring and I'm
[52:50] keeping it getting ready for my car you
[52:52] go buy a 5 lit petrol and you'll say I'm
[52:55] going to fill this Petrol in my car
[52:57] faith is rugged like
[52:59] that faith has muscles like
[53:03] that faith has muscles that if you're
[53:05] looking for a house amen expecting
[53:07] believing God for a house maybe you
[53:09] can't afford the house right now but you
[53:11] go buy some doily
[53:13] cloths that you're going to put in the
[53:16] house
[53:19] hey you'll start to buy the things in
[53:22] for the kitchen why you're going to show
[53:24] God I got the stuff amen I need
[53:27] somewhere to put it but faith will do
[53:29] [Music]
[53:31] that praise the
[53:34] Lord that's
[53:35] right Fai if you're looking for a
[53:38] girlfriend will make you buy the
[53:40] chocolates and keep it
[53:45] now praise the
[53:49] Lord so you the amen we're going to
[53:52] close now amen praise the
[53:54] Lord I'm trying to show you that Faith
[53:56] requires
[53:57] something I don't know if you just
[53:59] understood it in the scripture Faith
[54:01] requires something in return that
[54:04] because you believe faith will bring
[54:06] something in return love is not like
[54:08] that love doesn't require anything in
[54:12] return
[54:16] yes love does not require anything in
[54:19] return Faith requires something in
[54:22] return I have faith because I want
[54:23] whatever I'm believing for
[54:27] but love doesn't require something in
[54:30] return which means love is not based on
[54:35] conditions you may have faith in a
[54:39] person amen sorry you may not have faith
[54:42] in a person but you can love that
[54:47] person but if you don't love that person
[54:49] you can't have faith in them I'm showing
[54:51] you which is a higher dimension
[54:58] there may be people who have done things
[54:59] to break your trust and you lose faith
[55:02] in them but yet with The Gap love you
[55:04] can still love
[55:06] them maybe you don't have faith in them
[55:09] anymore they broken your
[55:11] trust but
[55:13] love will still make you love them
[55:17] doesn't mean you can't love
[55:20] them praise the Lord
[55:27] and love won't write people
[55:30] off no matter what they've done
[55:33] right no matter how backslid they
[55:36] are no matter which church they
[55:38] Fellowship
[55:39] in I need somebody to say better amen
[55:42] than that come on we're killing Spirits
[55:44] here
[55:45] now love conquers all am so I'm saying
[55:50] maybe your faith in them is gone but
[55:53] your love can still
[55:55] prevail I still love them they're my
[55:57] brother my
[55:59] sister Lord they've hurt me so
[56:02] badly that I've lost all confidence in
[56:04] their
[56:05] word but yet I love
[56:09] them I'm talking about a god kind of
[56:11] love
[56:14] now Lord but my memory was bringing back
[56:17] things to my mind that is just showing
[56:19] me that they've done so evil against me
[56:21] but love conquers
[56:23] me I've been conquered by love
[56:28] and love becomes this conquering force
[56:30] that just flows through me like a river
[56:33] that I can't help but love them
[56:37] amen praise the
[56:42] Lord the Bible says love does not seek
[56:45] its
[56:46] own love is
[56:48] patient love is kind
[56:52] amen amen we know Faith requires
[56:55] patience patience we know James tell us
[56:58] the testing of your faith work with
[57:00] patience praise the Lord love is patient
[57:05] you can have faith to move mountains and
[57:07] you can be considered in the Christian
[57:09] world as somebody great powerful man of
[57:14] God but if you don't have charity the
[57:16] Bible says you are
[57:18] nothing you can prove your
[57:21] faith but you may not have
[57:24] love so what what we are saying this
[57:26] morning when you have increased to
[57:28] perfect Faith it's time to enlarge your
[57:30] territory and push out into Gap
[57:34] love amen push out into a gape love it's
[57:37] time to enlarge a territory and move the
[57:39] faith territory into a love territory
[57:41] because the essence of Love is faith
[57:44] hope and charity it operates as one
[57:49] unit without the Capstone of Charity we
[57:52] are building in faith imagine building
[57:54] all seven virtues and no
[57:57] charity we have built in faith imagine
[57:59] building a house and no
[58:01] roof can you live in the
[58:04] house that's what it is then we've built
[58:07] this beautiful house but no
[58:12] roof we may have even furnished the
[58:14] house but you forgot to put the
[58:17] roof we are building in vain we would
[58:20] have built from Faith to brotherly
[58:22] kindness in
[58:23] vain all of it would profit nothing if
[58:26] charity the Capstone don't come
[58:30] am so the message came to turn our
[58:33] hearts back to the original
[58:35] faith and we know seven Thunders give us
[58:39] Faith so what will it take for that
[58:41] Capstone of love to come down to cap the
[58:43] pyramids of our life we need to grow up
[58:46] to
[58:48] charity add to your faith virtue amen if
[58:51] something isn't adding up in your
[58:53] life you need to add up to charity
[58:58] amen and I tell you as Believers as Sons
[59:00] and Daughters of God we're making a
[59:02] declaration this morning we will not be
[59:06] satisfied until charity comes amen amen
[59:09] tell your neighbor that Hallelujah tell
[59:11] him I will not be
[59:13] satisfied until charity
[59:15] [Music]
[59:17] comes so these are the territories we
[59:19] must take over we know the most powerful
[59:21] force on the earth is love and as we
[59:24] extend our borders past Faith virtue
[59:26] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[59:27] brotherly kindness we are ready to cross
[59:29] over into that dimension of
[59:33] love and with
[59:36] this I am
[59:38] something now I can speak to mountains
[59:41] with
[59:42] love and it makes me
[59:44] [Music]
[59:45] something now I can give my body to be
[59:48] burned with love and I am something what
[59:51] makes me
[59:52] something love the agape love yes sir
[59:58] amen without without this love I am
[1:00:00] nothing but with this love I am
[1:00:03] something so love gives me my Essence
[1:00:06] love give me my worth love give me my
[1:00:09] value how many of you have known people
[1:00:11] that just unloved in this world they
[1:00:15] Feel So Unworthy they don't feel worth
[1:00:18] anything because they are not
[1:00:23] loved there are two important things you
[1:00:26] need in this
[1:00:28] life can I say three now you need to
[1:00:31] love God you need to have the love of
[1:00:35] God and you need to be
[1:00:37] loved amen amen praise the
[1:00:40] Lord so with this I can become a
[1:00:43] complete man
[1:00:45] amen and let the great love Spirit come
[1:00:48] upon each and every one of us this
[1:00:49] morning let's just read now in
[1:00:51] completion amen we are done now with our
[1:00:54] sermon let's just read our scripture
[1:00:56] and let's read it with understanding Now
[1:00:58] 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:01:01] 13 I pray this is okay this morning am
[1:01:04] we have learned something amen praise
[1:01:06] the
[1:01:07] Lord because we can't be this all
[1:01:10] powerful man this Adam man on the earth
[1:01:11] without this
[1:01:13] elements though I speak with tongues of
[1:01:16] men and angels and have not charity now
[1:01:19] remember you can replace that word with
[1:01:21] love I am become as sounding brass a
[1:01:24] tinkling symbol
[1:01:26] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[1:01:28] and understand all Mysteries and all
[1:01:30] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:01:33] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:01:35] not charity I am
[1:01:38] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[1:01:41] to feed the poor and though I give my
[1:01:43] body to be burned and have not charity
[1:01:45] it profit me nothing now here's about
[1:01:49] love charity suffered long long
[1:01:52] suffering is kind charity envieth not
[1:01:56] charity wanted not itself is not puffed
[1:01:59] up does not behave itself unseemingly
[1:02:02] seek it not her own is not easily
[1:02:05] provoked think it no
[1:02:08] evil rejoice it not in
[1:02:11] iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth
[1:02:15] Bears all
[1:02:19] things believes all
[1:02:21] things I thought you just needed faith

[1:02:24] supercharge now
[1:02:26] open all
[1:02:28] things praise the Lord endureth all
[1:02:34] things Love Never Fails but whether they
[1:02:38] be prophecies they shall fail whether
[1:02:40] they be tongues they shall sees whether
[1:02:43] they be knowledge it shall vanish away
[1:02:45] for we know in part we prophesy in part
[1:02:48] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:02:51] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:02:53] away with amen when I was a child as
[1:02:55] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:02:58] I thought as a child now you see what
[1:03:01] he's bringing here now adoption the boy
[1:03:03] under tutor thought like that he says
[1:03:06] but now that I've come to full
[1:03:09] maturity I became a man I put away this
[1:03:11] childish things am for now we see
[1:03:14] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[1:03:16] face and now I know in part but then I
[1:03:19] shall know even as
[1:03:22] also I am known and now abided Faith
[1:03:26] hope and charity and these three things
[1:03:29] and these three but the greatest of
[1:03:31] these is Charity praise the Lord amen
[1:03:35] let's turn to Peter there amen I just
[1:03:36] want to read that because I want to show
[1:03:38] you there's no separation between

[1:04:29] of the divine nature so he's talking
[1:04:32] about Jesus Christ divine nature
