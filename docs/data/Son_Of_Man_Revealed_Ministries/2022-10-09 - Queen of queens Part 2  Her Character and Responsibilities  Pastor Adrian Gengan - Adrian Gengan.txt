called queen of Queens talking about the Bride of Heaven amen and how amen the King of Kings has a wife amen this morning we'll look at a character and our responsibilities this queen of Queens amen a character and her responsibilities let's turn to Esther chapter 1 and verse 9. amen [Music] the bride must have certain characteristics and she does have responsibilities amen let's read Esther chapter one and verse 9. also Esther the queen Made A Feast for the women in the Royal house which belonged to King aceres she is the queen she is making a feast in the Royal house that belongs to the king let's drop to verse 10. on the seventh day when the heart of the King was Mary with wine he commanded mailman bisla bigger after and caucus the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of a hazarus the king now you've got to know that there are seven spirits of God Amen that also went forth into the Earth anointing those seven Church age Messengers amen and what will they do they were going to bring vasty the queen before the king with the rod with the Crown Royal so he wants her to appear before the king clothed in a Royal apparel with the crown to show the people and the princes of Beauty for she was fair to look on okay but the queen busty refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very rough and his anger burned in him so you'll find at the end of the lady Sian Church age she still didn't want to come and the King was angry he's standing at the door and he's knocking amen so we'll drop to verse 15 and it says what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to the law because she has not performed the Commandment of the king Ace arrested by the chamberlains and memo can answered before the king and the princes vastly the queen had not done wrong to the king only you see these churches they haven't only done wrong to Jesus but to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of King azerus for this deed of the queen shall come abroad and to all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported the king then King Asus is commanded vastly the queen to be brought in before him but she came not likewise shall the ladies of Persia and media say this day unto all the king's princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall they arise too much content and Wrath if it please the king let they go a royal commandment from him let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the medes that it not be that it being or not altered that vastly come no more before King Israel and let the King give a Royal Estate unto another that is better than she amen we're going to go to chapter four now amen after we find here that now there's a new Queen in town there's a new Queen serving the people amen and we are late in the story now where there's a threat put upon the Jewish people we're gonna pick it up from verse 9. ATEC is typing the fivefold ministry right and watch what they are doing they are echoing back the words of mordecaya Mordecai typing the seventh age messenger random amen because there'll be a people who are Faithfully taught to say only what the messenger said so ATEC is in another place he cannot come and speak directly to Esther catch the thought now Graham is in another place he cannot come and talk to Esther but he is speaking by the faithful Ministry yes and it says that attack came and told Esther the words of Mordechai who's telling you the word of Branham week after week amen if not attack again is to speak unto ATEC and gave him commandment unto Mordecai all the king's servants and the kings of the king's Province do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner Court which is not called there is one law of is to put him to death now look at the contrast the first time it was death to Queen busty not to come into His presence now there's a law to come into the king's presence this you're going to be put to death except such as to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but I have not been called to come in unto the king these 30 days and they told to Mordecai Esther's words then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther sing not within thyself that thou shall Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews for if thou all together Hold Us thou peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou Art come into the kingdom for such a time as this then estimate them return Mordecai this answer go gather together all the Jews that are present in shushan and fasting for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day I also am I mating for fast likewise and so while I go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish so Mordecai went his way and did according to all Esther had commanded him amen may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated you know funny enough I was looking at a picture this morning and I downloaded it and uh it was from 11 years ago socienita 11 years ago she sang at a concert of ours and you know Facebook has a way of reminding you of the past and he threw up this picture and Karen's picture is there and you need it's the first concert Karen came to and sister Janita was singing so are you going to sing for us this morning she's just like my wife amen they don't want to sing after they get married amen amen we'll give you a break this time but next time please come prepared does your husband know that you sing that well okay that's good she sings very well brother I'm sure she sings you to sleep every night amen now the qualities of a woman that Jesus is looking for to be is Queen amen that's what we're looking for a character and our responsibilities when you're looking for a queen you cannot take a woman off the street it's going to be a specific class of a woman amen you cannot take an ordinary woman and bring it into the uh to the Royal household amen look at what Prince Harry has done he took an adulterous woman I forget the name Megan came to me now Meghan Markle an adulterous woman and he brought her into the Royal household and did you see what she's done she refused to follow the Royal protocol of the royal household and she took the prince away from the United Kingdom he's now not even staying in his own country that's what finding the wrong type of woman would do to you and Christ will not settle for the wrong type of church Christ should only come to the right type of church amen so if you got my notes over the amen let's go to my notes amen we'll take it from brother Brandon because I'm not here to preach my own message I'm here like ATEC to preach back what the prophet is preached amen he says here when you're looking for a wife now Brothers pay attention sisters you too he's giving you three things to do he says you have to plan you have to look you have to pray amen when you're choosing so the pride that a man would choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what's in him she's going to help him make his future home amen Christ isn't going to take a bride that's in the world acts like the word partaking of the world and Counting God's Commandments as if he never wrote them amen so he's looking for a character amen you ask what type of a character he says the real true Born Again Church must have the character that was in Christ because the husband and wife are one and if Jesus only did that which pleased God kept his word and manifested his word his bride will have to be the same kind of character man amen ask yourself this morning are you keeping the word of God amen are you reflecting his character amen come on now take the word of God and use it as a Looking Glass this morning and don't only take certain parts of the word take every Speck of the word and if you are not lining up line up with the word this morning amen people are biased when they're looking at themselves amen God bless you my sister and see you there you came with sister Janita amen hallelujah amen people are biased when they look at themselves when they look at themselves suddenly there's Angels Wings there [Music] even sitting here in church this morning we come into the house of correction some of you got a little extra space for your angel wings amen Hallelujah but when we look at ourselves through God's looking glass you know what he tells us that our righteousness is like filthy rags we cannot depend on our own righteousness amen our own human ability right you know that when we depend on our own human ability how we fail the flesh man you even sit and you wonder and say oh what happened now how come you let me down flesh man why the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak and that's why we want your body change we are tired of the stressed outs amen God didn't send church amen presbyters he didn't send Bishops he didn't send Cardinals and Priests and popes he sent the Holy Ghost to lead the church we are looking upon men for a too much amen we are looking upon human leadership too much we must depend on the leadership of the Holy Spirit the one that was sent to leave the church amen amen amen there is no holy man amongst us but there is one holy God and he sent his holy spirit to fill the believer amen that's what was sent to lead the church he said when he the Holy Ghost is come he will lead you into all truth to reveal these things to you to bring them to your remembrance amen now what was vasy doing she was in the king's Royal household she was having a sister's meeting hello the Bible says that she was having a a banquet for the Sisters in the king's Palace she was having a sister's meeting and their theme song was sisters are doing it for themselves okay they invited Beyonce to come sing there the shoes on my feet I bought it the car I'm driving I bought it it wasn't an independent movement it was women's liberation amen right and they refused to come out at the command of the king amen and we'll be looking at vastly we look at our condemnation but when the king of commanded us to forsake not the ascending together of ourselves we refuse to come into His presence amen and the guest speaker that day was Bishop Jakes and he was going to speak on women that were loose from The Tyranny of King azuris they were having a Merry Old Time amen they were having a seven-day conference they had Joyce Meyer come in amen and all of these women preachers when the Bible condemns woman preachers he says I suffer a woman not to teach but your self authority over a man and that Still Remains the word of God in the 21st century but then there was a queen that was chosen Queen Esther a type of the queen of Jesus and she looks that out she can please the king amen the true bride attracts the attention of God the prophet says by keeping the word how can you extract God's presence you may ask you need to keep his word he says let us notice Christ there was no Beauty in him that we should desire him he always comes in beauty of character Christ wasn't a beautiful great strong Stout man God doesn't choose that kind you remember when he was choosing King David they brought all the strong men before the prophet to anoint Ed amen but God chose a righty looking boy and he shows him and he anointed him amen we choose by sight but God chooses by character amen amen and the fact that you are sitting here this morning tells me that you are peculiar people amen you are a special class of people that God has chosen do you know it's no ordinary thing for you to believe the message of the hour you were chosen and predestinated from before the foundation of the world you have that special character that God is looking for he says it's not worldly beauty of him that attracts his bride it's his character the character of the church that Jesus looks for not big buildings great denominations big memberships he promised to meet with wherever two or three are gathered now the True Believer rest his hopes upon the word of God being Vindicated in truth so we know just as that we are looking at Christ's character he is looking at our character he chooses a bride to reflect his character he says the modern churches of today misses his program by a million miles what is he looking for really yes if we quote this all the time the Jesus Christ is Hebrews 13 8 but he is look at what the prophet is saying he is looking for the for the day for the bride to be formed Hebrews 13 8 just exactly like he was now you know you can hardly be the way you was yesterday hey yesterday you were full of faith yesterday you were on fire for God today amen but God wants us to be what is he saying he wants us to be consistent Christians he's saying he wants the pride he's looking for the day for the bride to be formed Hebrews 13 8 just exactly like he was the Bible says let your yea be a and you may be made God is Not Looking for compromising Christians amen but God is looking for believers in this hour who will stand firm on his word irrespective of whether it's a popular opinion or not but they will stand on his word amen he says it's got to be his same flesh same bone Same Spirit same everything just exactly built up them too then become one until the church becomes that they are not the character of him the word for this age must be molded she must be molded like he is thank you amen now when we're looking at the responsibilities of a queen we know that the first queen in the Bible the queen of Adam's art was Queen Eve and she was given this responsibility to stay behind the word but she forsook her responsibility because she lasted after knowledge but Adam the prophet says took the responsibility upon himself when he covered her Adam knew what he was doing amen and he sold the whole human race to sin that he might have Eve for he loved her but if anybody ever wants to know God hear what the prophet is saying you you have to know God and His nature before you can understand his word people are trying to understand a written text they want to make sense of it and that is why they tell you but that word when Paul wrote back then was for another type of people but if you don't understand his nature you won't understand his word now you know why the prophet is so powerful he said I may not know the scriptures like these many theologians he says the way I understand God is through nature he says I'm a typologist you gotta understand God in his nature he says he's always giving man a warning and a reminder of our responsibility we are responsible and God has put us on Earth for a reason and that reason that he has put us on year four we are responsible to him for that reason you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do he says if you went to work for a man and you were walking on a ranch and you just went to the barn and sat down you know some people are like that if you don't tell him and instruct them what to do they'll just sit down they got a job to two look at what the prophet says it says well you must go and ask him what he wants you to do then you do it if you're working for a man find out what your duties are then if our life on Earth here then if our life is on Earth here then we should go to the one who put us here and say Lord what would you have me do what must I do why am I here if it's to be a housewife dishwasher whatever God wants you to do then you do the very best that you know how to do it no matter how little no matter how little it is you must do it the trouble of it is each one of us wants to do the next man's job we all want to pack the ball as we say amen now I I know there's a saying out there but I don't believe it applies to us there's a saying and it's called oxygen Thief I'm waiting for you in the back it goes from here and it goes slowly oxygen teeth you must have heard that term some of you may have used it you know what an oxygen tea feels [Music] but God as you hear for a purpose I don't believe there are any Oxygen thieves here not when you're called into the economy of God so if God has called you for a purpose if you ask God what your purpose is and when he's revealed to your purpose are you faithful to fulfill that purpose he says each one of us wants to do the next man's job now I can never be a prophet I'm not a prophet I can't be an evangelist I can try to do the work of an evangelist if the Lord asked me to do but I'm not an evangelist I can't take the next man's shop amen and neither can you but when the body is strictly framed together amen then we can function amen that's why we need one another now you may not be be called in the five-fold ministry but you can be operating one of the nine spiritual gifts that's given to the church amen let's let's just see some examples here and watch the patented him now he says the side of the Prophet had a great responsibility remember we are speaking about it means responsibility as I the prophet knew he had a great responsibility what did he do he went to the temple to pray now that's a good thing for all of us to do go down to the temple and pray right and once he began to pray what happened a vision broke up he saw the Lord I and lifted up let's look at Elisa what happened when the responsibility was placed upon Elisa to anti-brite for Isaac Ellie is a being a spiritual man knew that he needed the right kind of woman for Isaac what did he do in the hour of desperation when he arrived at the city he began to pray he says when you get desperate go to pray amen amen amen Lord God let the first maid that comes forth and what is the camel give me a drink be that he prayed in that hour of desperation you know what the problem is we are not desperate enough we are too comfortable with life here treats us well let us here gives us a good income leadership gives us Medical Aid latest here gives us pension Provident fund so we become like that Rich Young Ruler take ease my soul all is well but it wasn't so what was the review given to that man he says now fool and when he when he opened up his eyes when he died he opened up his eyes where was he in hell Hallelujah Rebecca herself when she came she made a commitment to follow Eliza even though she had never seen Isaac listen to what he says in paragraph 96 he said Rebecca is a type of the Bride you've never seen Christ but you hear by his servants what he is amen you sell out everything you leave your homes everything else it takes to go find him now notice she made a decision a type of the Bride left a denominational home to go amen yes now here's a prophet giving a kind of Life advice to us he says we run from trouble we run from responsibilities we are all prone to do that we are more prone to run than we are to stand and face it out we find ourselves running from responsibilities sometimes we find ourselves prone to run from work we don't want to work some people just think they can make a living without working but I think Solomon said we can find the answer in watching an end you know a little ant they tell me if an ant doesn't work and lay in that ant doesn't eat that winter so everybody has to work we got so many things we have to do so much responsibility we have to face everybody has got to face a certain responsibility he says when you choose a wife to be married choose a husband you take a responsibility you must remember maybe you build a home it's a pretty nice home remember after as a married woman you think of the responsibility of raising children you gotta think of them pretty slick walls is going to have dirty entrance all over them I feel sorry for my wife now she has to go do it all over again you know those crayon writings on the wall and everything these babies think they are commissioned pick up your pen and write dirty entrance all over them then you got the responsibility of educating your children are you listening to your prophet you got the responsibility of clothing and feeding everything is a responsibility and it's so easy when responsibilities face us to shirt from them and we find out that marriage is a responsibility in all manners Hallelujah amen and I pray amen that we are Faithfully taught husbands to face up to our responsibilities wives to face up to their responsibilities children to face up to their responsibilities that the house can function in order not only in the natural home but in the church the deacons face up to their responsibilities amen the laity face up to their responsibilities the musicians the song leaders the the ministers face up to their responsibilities then the body of Christ can function properly amen now he says many times ministers shook a responsibility of standing true to the word of God they'll shut that responsibility when truth of the world is brought face to face with us human beings we are prone to shut back until the last resource but we have to face up to responsibilities he says as a father you have to freeze up the responsibility to give your child a whipping them little fellows you don't want to do it but as a father or mother you have to face the responsibility of raising a child because the Bible says spare the rod you spoil your child and that still stands good in the sight of every psychologist there's in the world amen so I I believe you got the idea that all of us have responsibilities in life and if we are failing or falling short in them let's come back on track with the word of God and if you know the things we have been dealing with right now what the problem of speaking I've not been spiritual things but that's you fulfilling God's will for your life if you just look back the last 10 minutes everything the prophet was saying has been the natural Affairs of life but God is telling you that your responsibility as a man amen let's go back to helping the young people here 67. he says if I was a young man looking for a wife to be married yesterday girl to meet every qualification that I thought it took to make a woman why morally she was a queen and lovely and a fine personality a real Christian everything I could think of to make me a good wife no matter how I much I say she's perfect she's exactly right she isn't mine till I accept her and the responsibility of being my wife what is he telling you young man young girl not the young girl so much I don't want you girls to be forward now a young man woman is cut out to be on you and you see that she's fine in character now you want to act shy you don't want to talk to her you want somebody to Foster the phone you well if she likes me she must phone me you gotta face up to the responsibility and even if you get rejected you gotta try otherwise she's never going to be yours he says now when we come into a meeting and see the power of God moving and doing things doing Supernatural Works seeing perform look in the Bible see its promise for the hour then we see those things we are confronted with the responsibility to either accept it now people may sympathize with it then in the thing you're responsible for you're not responsible to sympathize with the message he says but you've got to accept it it's got to become part of you and you are part of it then it's yours amen listen what he says here when you marry a certain woman that you have chosen you are one then and that's the way you are with Christ when you see manifested made real then you are part of him and he is part of you and together you're part of the message amen that's what I was trying to convey to you last week you are the message yeah the message is not just some text written about the seals yeah amen he says when you become part of him and he becomes part of you together you are part of the message amen you are the Revival stop looking for the Revival outside stop looking for some Dynamic evangelist to come and stir you up stir you up emotionally the Revival is going on within you daily amen amen he says Christianity is everyday rocket living living for God in this present world it's a constant burning of the fire and love of God in the heart and if you feel that way every day there's a fire of God within you every day there's a love of God within you amen that sets of fire and puts her you out yonder with the people making converts to Christ he says responsibilities getting a man running from the presence of God he says You must accept your responsibility we Lester was faced with it one day she was living a luxurious life in the palace she had all of her needs taken care of there was nothing short for Queen Esther but suddenly one day there came an urgent cry a knock on the door there was a threat on a people's life then we're gonna kill them and what did Mordecai do he placed the burden upon Esther he plays the responsibility upon Esther yes and all seven churches are gone off the scene that always the responsibility placed on right now who will carry the message forward amen who will carry the gospel forward amen you didn't ask for it but the responsibility has been placed on your shoulders amen amen then that sigh and cry for the Abomination 10 in the city listen to what he says here now and the responsibility that God has given us in this day to bring this message as I get older my no my days are shortening up I feel the responsibility greater than I ever felt pressing on we must do it we must get down to it everywhere we go and tell the message amen yes oh Hallelujah get involved in the service this morning amen hallelujah get the Breakthrough in the service this morning amen Satan will surprise you up this morning but in the presence of the Lord there is Liberty amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen you know why people don't like the responsibility brother preach me how I am blessed teach me how to get blessings of God I'm teaching you how to get blessed take on the responsibilities amen that God has given us and the Lord will reward us amen amen he says we must get down to it you know what getting down to it is you have to get your hands dirty you have to get your feet dirty amen amen and do the hard work tell the message tell the people that Jesus is coming soon amen hallelujah it's as simple as that they may be saying hey I've heard that for the last 50 years but tell them he is much sooner coming now than he was 50 years ago you better get ready or you'll be left behind he is God and he's coming soon see not only tell them that Christ is coming he said tell them that Jesus is God and he's coming soon there's not a hope left in the world but the coming of the Lord he says it's always been that way it's been in man he has shot from God ever since Adam in the Garden of Eden when he came the responsibility to make his choice whether he would stay with God or with his wife the responsibility was up to him he either had to take what his wife said or what God Said and he chose the way of his wife and when he did that he lost his original condition and he brought the whole world subject to death when he had to take the responsibility of accepting new light that his wife had found he says 10 words they couldn't keep eight or ten words amen I want you to know Jesus did not show his responsibilities no matter how bad sleeping you are Jesus still doesn't show his responsibilities because if you are a predestinated son and daughter of God no matter how far gone you are if even if you're a prodigal this has a responsibility to save you amen hallelujah yes God is not going to shut his responsibility about saving you and healing you and setting you free just because you are in a backslidden condition it's like any father whip take care of his child no matter if the child is stubborn and Disobedience sometimes he still has a responsibility to that child amen the heart of the father was revealed in the story of The Prodigal Son amen the father was there looking out when his son would return and when he came back the father didn't say oh now you're coming back began well like a big man you know we Indian strong okay there was nobody like you you were having big mouth with me now Father's Heart was not like that and that father was revealing the heart of God the father was only concerned about one thing that my son which was dead amen is now come back to me he's alive it's time for rejoicing it's time to rejoice in the presence of God amen hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen hallelujah and Jesus amen when he took all the responsibility he went all the way Jesus didn't Shook at his responsibility when they slapped him he didn't say the slap is too much for me when they put a crown of thorns upon his head he didn't say this is too much for me to bear when they put the cross upon his back and told him to match up called God is healed he didn't give up when they put 39 Stripes upon his back Jesus Took on all the responsibility he knew there's a price that must be paid in order to redeem you amen and Jesus went all the way even when they were nailing him to the Cross they didn't give him painkillers when they were trying to stitch up the sand here they numbed it all around they didn't go in none Jesus hand and say Jesus are you feeling any pain but they cruelly crucified him and Jesus himself said Lord if it be thy will let this cup pass from me the agony the pain but then he had a flesh he saw your picture come in front of him he thought of you when he was on the cross that day amen you and I yes thank you Hallelujah he said if I do not go down to Calvary then my loved one will be lost and die amen and the prophet says if you can't live without you you better marry her so he decided that he wants to marry you and he said release the bride I will die in a place but let the pride Go free and a Roman soldier took a spear and pierced him in his side and that's when the pride was set free amen Hallelujah at Calvary oh bless the name of Jesus give the Lord a good idea of praise for the work which he has done and it's a wonderful work amen amen he many many men all he didn't shock his responsibility Jesus amen lived up to his responsibility and even this morning he is still living up to his responsibility amen amen hallelujah sometimes you'll be faced with situations like right now I am placing a certain responsibility on you to receive this word or not look at you right that day she didn't ask to hear this testimony about the squirrels being created in the woods but brother Branham relating the story to her about how those squirrels came into existence placed a responsibility upon her whether she was going to believe that to be the truth or not she took it upon herself to take the responsibility to agree with the man of God and she said that's exactly right brother pranam let's say he this morning Hallelujah the power of an amen Hallelujah that's what she had she had the power of an amen amen and when she began to say that's exactly right brother Branham says amen the spirit of God came into that room and he says you can ask her whatever she desires right now amen I want you to know that same Spirit of the Lord is still here this morning amen and the power of your
