Pastor God bless you uh thank you very much and I pray that the Lord help us to kind of Fellowship around things that are going to give us rupturing Faith amen hallelujah amen amen when I was fellowship with a pastor during lunch and you begin to go into things I had left my notes at home but uh it sounded like he was reading my notes and I was kind of hey should I give him the notebook so that you just proceeds amen amen but I enjoyed the fellowship and the pastor was going event straight into the things that I had written and had left my notebook at home so my goodness you bless you Pastor it kind of gave me the courage I meant to to come and fellowship with you amen amen so shall we power yes to pray before we read these scriptures amen dear Lord Jesus Christ like to commit myself into their own hands there's a vessel until one honor I like to accept the responsibility in the calling fellowshipping and the inspiring receiving the anointing and the inspiring from your presence you say the heavens and the Earth shall pass away at your way do remain forever my prayer this evening father you said where two or three are guarded yes you will be in their meetings oh yes we are more than two we are more than three yes Lord again with hearts that are ready amen forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us amen pray that to me pour down your spirit Upon Us upon All Flesh in this building as you promised in your word amen Lord I pray that your inspiration and your anointing be with us and you come and take over and help us through your weight and take us into your Shekinah glory amen that we may come out of this service it strengthens [Music] preparing us for what is to come yes what you have promised we accept it and we believe it in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen like to invite you to go with me to the Book of Exodus chapter 14 I'd like to read from verse 13 up to verse 15. so that's chapter 14. this is 13 to 15. amen amen um the Bible says from verse 18. and Moses said unto the people fear not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord hallelujah which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom we have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me yes take unto the children that they go forward amen you may be seated amen may the Lord of his word amen we were reading Exodus 14 verses 13 up to 15. so I would like to kind of encourage one another yes as we wait for the change of our body but they are things that the prophet says we uh is Believers we should be able to come to that level before we can talk about the same hallelujah amen yes so we are going to be trying to dis to encourage one another so that you know because brother says God doesn't work with cowards yes absolutely amen so is we as the Church of God are cowards then we are guaranteed God is never going away with us amen so now we have a scenario that our brother or the prophet of that age Moses um is rebuked by God on verse 15. amen yes but um what surprised me with this one is that now God predicts brother Moses on verse 15. after the same brother Moses had encouraged the people on this 13 and 14. so how come that after he had preached A good sermon to encourage the church amen then he finds himself in an awkward situation where he's now scared of the same situation that he was encouraging that believer many a times that happens yes because God does test each and everyone I was telling Pastor Denzel that these days I I'm trying to be very careful in the sermons that I preach because I have discovered that God test me on every sermon that I preach every one of them absolutely so I better know what I'm talking about because after you preach about it yeah God is gonna make sure that you leave that way because the brother says I would rather you leave me a sinner than to preach me one yes amen I'd like to start by taking you to my first quotation which is found down in the book in the message why cry uh speak tip number six three zero seven one four m I'm in paragraph it's quite a long but I'm gonna be following it paragraph by paragraph I mean so that we don't get lost because um our Moses had already encouraged other believers but now God comes and say why are you crying yes he was now crying yes and God doesn't want to cry baby God does in one cry babies amen and it doesn't work with cowards yes and they say when the going gets tough yes the tough gets going so in this it's an hour is there are so many problems hair has been broken loose amen but the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a friend oh yes my spirit Hallelujah not your spirit his spirit is going to raise that place so there is no standard that we're gonna be raised by the enemy that God has not gotten a solution then he is already prepared for his people amen so he must not complain we must not cry we must never complain amen and says we must not complain amen now we find brother Moses [Music] here we see Moses expressing fully Human Nature always wants God to get behind you and push you into something now that's us today you want God to ask her after you will have seen you all we have seen after seeing the pillow fight amen after seeing the crowd we still want God to push you to do something he says you see Moses said just relaxed around which is what we've done relaxing God I will go ask you see what you say yeah yeah you say it well all right I will say it too Moses is waiting to say if God speaks then I'm gonna speak that may sound very scriptural yes but it's not amen now brother says here it's actually Human Nature to be lazing around and waiting for God to do everything amen we want God to push us into sin we want God to push us into our Solutions we want God to push us into our blessings we want God to push us into the things that we are wanting in our hearts but God doesn't work like that we are told by the Bible we are co-workers Jesus said the father worked at the hither to end I work so you have to work yourself God is going to do something and he expects you to do something as well he's not going to be doing anything because he is not a dictator he's a co-worker you know when he created the heavens and the Earth and he put Adam and even the Garden of Eden the Bible says when he created the animals you know what he did yes yes the Bible says he left the animals without names not because he was confused because he was overawaked no not because he was tired or not because he didn't know that the seals of the names inside of him but the Bible says he left them without names he wanted to see what Adam would name them because he's counting on you he wants you to do something in the kingdom of God so he wants you to to make a decision yeah and he told his angels watch my boy yes yes amen he is good my mind he is good access to the secrets of my heart what I know he knows you know what the Bible says [Music] we have the mind of the Lord [Applause] that he was with him and he is the circumstance comes up and then he begins to cry What Can I Do Lord what can I do yes so Moses had already been ordained by God for the job that God wanted him to do but somebody got in a complex yes these begin to be not confident about his calling one problem that we have as message Believers we don't have confidence in what we are doing Hallelujah we don't have confidence in our position as the bride of Christ amen but Jesus when he came you know what he told the Pharisees when they were trying to disapprove his ministry he says you know what before Abraham was I am hallelujah amen and he told them you are searching the scriptures because in them we have eternal life but if you read them scriptures they are pointing back to me you are gonna come back to this ministry because I am the interpretation of the way down that you are eating at home let me tell you something that tapes that you are going to they are testifying of the five-fold ministry they are testifying of the power of the Holy Ghost operating in the church Hallelujah thank you Lord because the bride the prophet says she is a Ministry amen somebody asked in the question and answer said shall the bride have a Ministry before the Rapture yes before the Rapture Amen in the prophet says yes she does he says that is what is happening now consisting of what the apostles pastors evangelists in teachers and the mind of Christ to know what he was done by his way and she is the final voice to the final age so we are ordained already Yes Moses was already ordained but here he was crying paragraph 205. the prophet says now you remember he had to already prophesied he for he said this Egyptian that you see today you will see no more he was under the anointing yes and then immediately after prophesy he begins to cry in as much as it may sound funny but this is exactly what is happening in our lives every day as Believers yes yes if you [Music] we live a life that is contrary to what we are praying for that's what Moses was doing after pointing out the children of Israel I say yeah these people that we are seeing you are going to see them no more God is going to deal with them and eradicate them Hallelujah and the people say the amen soon after that he's crying why because after prayer after speaking the word that devil is gonna be waking yes against what you are speaking about and remember because you most of our prayers we do them loudly amen yes when he was talking about the savoring the seal yes they say when you're talking about that that has our silence he said God is hiding the the details of his plan from the Devil he says because any sound has got a meaning in the devil to take that and you know what is being talked about so the silence was Information Management so God that any would not know the plan of God Amen Hallelujah yes so most of our prayers the devil hears them yes and the moment you do that the devil is also planning against what you are praying for against what we have spoken that is why many times when you are prayed before soon after you get worse that's what bottom says yes I mean so many times as Believers we forget yes when we pray for something soon after prayer we find that things are going contrary to our prayers and we break down yes because when God is about to bless you the Devil comes into frustrate you Amen to push you away from your testimony that is supposed to come after your prayer you back off and live a life contrary to what you were praying about what am I talking about one day we were having a campaign in one of the suburbs in Zimbabwean in one of the areas so we pitch the attendant for one week Sunday to Monday so as we I mean Monday to Sunday so as we preach the word from Monday Tuesday and it was rain season amen now on Friday who will take our services from start preaching around six so around six on Friday it started raining amen and now when it started raining the brother who was responsible for that area he came to me and he said brother you see what is happening if the rains persist the Sinners for whom we have put the tent will not come and you'll be busy preaching to ourselves yeah we have not achieved anything so I said what so what he said you you pray for the rains to stop amen praise the Lord amen amen so I looked around and I'm like this brother is making life difficult for me so I looked for that for our roundings I saw his car parked maybe a few meters from the kingdom behind and I said can we go into your car himself and his wife and little children so he walked up there and then we will get into this car and then I'll begin to pray so I say I was Moses that day I say father for sure as my brother says if the rains continue the Sinners are not going to come out of their house so we will give wasted resources for nothing but anyway this is the rain season maybe there is a farmer somewhere who is requested for the range from you we don't want to interfere with them but here we are notifying crops we are preaching the question so I pray that the rain stop so that we can preach the gospel amen and they say the amen now what I'm talking about what causes what Moses did many times after prayer after speaking things still against you yes so the moment we finish prayer his wife steps out of the car and he follows and I'm behind so the moment we walked out as we were heading towards the tent the rains increased and then everyone begins to walk I mean run towards the tent is a man I also crushed my Bible under my armpit and begin to run towards the tent is I was two meters from the tent Dome I had a voice I was so embarrassed the voice said to me you have prayed for the rain to stop why are you running amen I sometimes thinking aloud but he came back and said you have prayed for the rain to stop yes why are you running so I stood there with my Bible under my armpit I went two steps backwards where I was coming from and I stood in the rain and everybody was inside for two three four five minutes the rain stopped we preached Friday Saturday amen Sunday I went to preach about 30 kilometers away from that area and I asked them when did the range stop they said on Friday evening amen Brethren if someone was knitting the rain I'm sorry I stopped it amen not because I'm special no I'm just a believer I'm just a Christian because I've received a commission from the Bible I have received a commission from this spoken word the Bible says go here and preach the gospel and that commission comes with the power of the Holy Ghost so brother Moses was now discouraged something had happened now he's looking at the enemy he says he goes to God in Christ Bible said he says what can I do after he had been commissioned after he had been ordained you forgot about all that yes Hallelujah why was he crying amen so when God is about to bless you God is gonna the devil is going to come and frustrate you so that you're running away from your promise but what I'm telling you now after you pray for something stay with your prayer amen after you've prayed for something you send your prayer to the last energy ever foreign amen hallelujah yes amen amen now once this was supposed to be remembering brother is saying Moses had already been commissioned Moses had already been ordained but he was afraid yes yes with all that he experience Moses calling was actually a supernatural one when Moses was called when he was heading laban's ship what happened the pillar of fire came down and he saw the pillar of fire on top of the bush and the voice spoke to him yes amen when the voice spoke to him he had the opportunity to see the supernatural he had an opportunity to hear the voice of God in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mission of God shall be finished the end time message people we have heard the voice of God in this hour in the power of the Holy Ghost says come down what are we waiting for stand up and put away down and go forward something else to happen but it takes you to claim the scripture [Music] if you wait for God to do everything nothing is going to be done amen hallelujah so God had already performed the miraculous in the life of Moses he had the sin the pillar of fire he had to sin the cloud he had heard the voice but still he was a coward still he was afraid still he was crying sometimes you wonder that message people after we have seen the witness of the clouder after the pillow fights come among we still crying and we are still covered possible how much more should God do amen listen to this he says now remember he had already prophesied okay after he done a pretty good job in prophesying there you see he then told them what would happen if the word of God was in him it was in him yes and when he was telling that it actually come to pass yes what he said was already going to happen to come to pass so after you've spoken you are currently what you have spoken is going to come to pass but your problem is before it comes to pass you run away you chicken out and you rob yourself of the testimony of the power of the Holy Ghost stay with your request amen don't chicken out he says what he say to us already going to come to pass and here he was crying amen what am I going to do he says oh if that isn't human beings if that isn't me that isn't me see he had already proved what you say will happen yes I am with you oh yes and here a circumstance Rose in a moment what must I do what must I do Lord hey Lord where are you at yes for the people he says and yet he said hey do you hear me he's talking to God what must I do and he had already ordained him and they Vindicated him and he proved and worked everything through him and hear God oh my fully expressing men was to rest and let God do the abortion and yet he knew that God anointed him so he was anointed he was commissioned he was ordained he had the pin of her experience he had the cloud experience but still he was becoming a coward that's why God was rebuking him he says oh my and proved and worked everything through him and here got all my fully expressing man was to rest and let God do the pushing and yet he knew that God had anointed him for this job to do this yes now remember God is never going to ask the church to do anything that he had not prepared us to do when God descends a man he jumps into him yeah and he does the job himself inside the man he is sent even this Precious Blood that most is when you are saved when the pure face stopped when the voice stopped talking to her brother from the pillar of fire in the bush what happened you didn't go back to Heaven no no no that pillow fight jumped into Moses and soon after that then you hear God telling more say hey now you are a God so you need a prophet I'll give you Aaron Hallelujah and from there you watch Moses the Pharaoh when he stands in front of Arrow when you are talking to God you are saying your people but when you stand before father he says hello let my people go I don't know because the pillow fire was inside of him the owner in the run of the church the pastor of the Church of the two million treasure was inside of Moses now he is crying what has happened he has forgotten the miraculous but something happened before God and proved to him that he was ordained let me tell you something that people of the legend of the hour you are already or danger you are ruined them you have been commissioned God the Holy Ghost of the hour is in our midst of operating the church inspiring somebody thank you the processes he says it was time for the people to be delivered yeah God through his miracles and Oneness it droved them all together in one group you follow me brought them all together in one group Vindicated these claims scripture said so he was the son he was the evidence he everything that he said then he come among them is a prophet ever whatever he said God honored it even to create and to bring up flies yes and the good things in existence and everything that he had promised him he he done it yes man yes Moses said created his life yes in Egypt do you see how we forget testimonies in our history yes when we Face some situations we forget what God has done he last week we forget what God did last year we forget what God did the last month we begin to cry amen but he wanted to wait on that says there is our issue and when you're dealing with the prophets that used to thus say is that otherwise they are not comfortable without that says the Lord they are not comfortable going forward yes yes Hallelujah he says he was waiting on that says the Lord you see issue he should have known that the very Vindication of his call was that stays the Lord hallelujah so he's waiting for that says the Lord but he already has the Sea of the Lord that is where our problem is the message people in this hour they are still waiting for that says the Lord but the pillow fire is Right amongst them they are still waiting for the center but the commission is amongst us we are still waiting for the same the Lord but we have the promise of the hour we have the Holy Ghost amongst us what are we waiting for amen his job that he was ordained to was thus says can you get it he says why did he wait on that says the Lord I mean oh the pillow fire was in him he had the voice of God and he had been given the commission but he was still waiting for that says the Lord but he himself was actually exhausted the Lord the commission was that says the Lord his calling was that says the Lord what are you waiting for Mozilla come on somebody must know that the pill of fire is a man says wherever this message is going to be preached is Amen to me yeah that is that says don't believe in this hour don't now let me make with you wait a minute if you remember that window in zaripas yes after God spoke to Elijah and told him that you go to that to zalipat I have commanded the woman there to to sustain thee now that's all right that's straightforward in God he's not a liar but if you go in the message brother says commanded there but she didn't know yeah yes absolutely so if she didn't know it how did God command him to sustain the men of God it means she never had a dream about it she never saw a vision about it she never had an audible voice about it but let me tell you the minister of the Gospel she felt like doing it and she did it but when she done that that is exactly the perfect story of God can containing his life her life what are you waiting for you're waiting for a dream we are waiting for a vision we are waiting for an audible voice that says the Lord with you the pill of fire is a testimony that The Testament is ensued oh amen hallelujah thank you Lord but we are still crying amen we still want another [Music] they are waiting for them God is never used them in a dream but they are waiting for the day but when you have a scripture when you have a quotation he says that says the Lord why am I saying that remember how the commission came to the prophet my people this message did not come from America no absolutely did not come from California or or Jefferson if you know that's cooking where it came from the presence of God you know what happened when he was in the Clinton Indiana how the message became the commission you know what happened this message is a supernatural message before we talk about it before we caught it before we read it it's a supernatural message so when you read it and compare with it that's Supernatural is gonna happen hallelujah amen amen when the commission came it didn't come on a motorbike yes yes yes it didn't come on a Boeing 727 yeah yeah no brother he came yes came by a 200 pound and he didn't come on foot yeah remember God is the owner of the flying saucers you know what the Bible say you know what the prophet says that 200 pound men stepped out of a ball of fire Hallelujah the commission came by the power of the Holy Ghost the commission came by the power of the presence of God it's a supernatural message on its own amen [Music] Glory and he told the prophet he says if you can only meet the people to believe you amen amen [Music] thank you Jesus nothing shall stand in your way and the person you remember what you were talking about when the Bible says behold I send you Elijah the Bible remember the scriptures are of comfort meaning it was not just telling you that is going to send you William Branham but after that departure of William the church is arranged by the speak of Elijah and that God is saying I send you now you are the Elijah that speak of Elijah is upon you that's why Elijah raised up and say where's the god of Elijah thank you Lord amen the ten division you remembered yes huh you know what brother never said I'm gonna rest yes he never said I want to rest but he says is the prayer line was going on the nice gentleman comes and cuts him off and says is brother Branham is resting we will continue with the prayer amen oh my God amen amen amen it was not the choice of brother Branham to rest no but the angel cut him off amen his time was up [Music] the prayer line is not going to stop it's going to continue that power of the Holy Ghost continues with a church we are not to say we have to see the power and the glory of the same God that brought upon them the bride is supposed to continue under now remember brother Bonham says this he says when you are saying she's the final voice Amen to the final age he says a message to the spirit of Elijah Hallelujah continues with the change continues in the brighter that's why brother was expecting you to do everything that you did amen yes and you know what he says now Paul if I go back to Paul Paul when he was talking about the grace of God he says the grace of God revealed unto me to you what yes did you hear them the grace of God revealed unto Paul to you so the final destination of the grace of God as it came from God through Paul the final destination is you amen that's why the same Bible says when God is looking at what he says my word is not going to come back to me void without accomplishment that we shall save it for when you sleep just were eaten Brothers says they were pushing for each generation yes when God was chopping Church edges these foundations he alluded the scriptures to say these scriptures we allude them for these brothers and sisters in giving between 1909 to 2025. these are the brothers who are going to meet these scriptures [Music] amen amen we have got a problem which we said now in English it means if you meet once you will always meet amen that if you meet once you always what and predestination tells us we are in God before the foundation of the world and we were actually in good and we were not just in good we were God we were part of God Amen that was actually used for the bride is the same material that is making the pride Hallelujah because Adam was Adam in Israel ease was just received inside of Adam what was left now was the cause of Calvary to pull out the life to pull out the woman to pull out the bride but when she comes out brother but I'm saying she is him she she power of his power bone of his bone flesh of his bone she is [Applause] yes so amen what we are waiting for you know one time he found a situation there was a baby that was sick very sick and you know men of God they are easily touched like that they are Shepherds you know so his shout is very big and he decided to confront God he said Lord if he were here and you see this child in this condition what were you going to do yes and the voice spoke to him and said I'm also waiting to see what you are going to do about it Hallelujah [Music] most of the things you are waiting for God to do he is waiting for you to do it amen yes yes you've got to make a decision like the like that we do it is Harry Potter without a dream yes without a vision without an audible Voice without nothing just to make a decision because you are inspired you know who you are Hallelujah the problem is our identity confusion we don't know who we are and represent the moment the bread comes to know who she is yes yes amen I hate this story of one of the dictators in Africa his son went out of the country I mean that was a circle is the sun went out of the country and he came back with a lot of goods and uh that that the immigration here they didn't really know this boy huh yes so he had a lot of things and they wanted him to to pay Duty and uh he didn't have so they tossed him about and took his stuff and pushed one side and you are not going you have to pay Duty they didn't know who he was so he decided no I think I needed this help so he goes to a telephone then he calls his father the president and he explains his situation he thought hey that he's gonna come with a helicopter to rescue him what we are doing with God yeah when the boy finished explaining his situation said what is your name and the boy was that he said I said what is your name and he said yet his name blah blah blah says yeah yes before he hanged the phone he said use your name amen hallelujah from that phone call that that young boy come from the phone booth with red eyes like a cake that is drink wine from the out of God facing the enemy amen hallelujah [Music] follow me Hallelujah because he came to a realization of who was and that is our problem is that right we are in a complex we don't know who we are we are refusing us to accept scriptures and quotations that are talking about that we are that we are the brighter amen oh yes so the message we have is that this is the Lord amen so sometimes we have to come up to our to our things and accept the responsibility that we have been given by God and believe in who we are yes and that's how Jesus overcame because he knew when it come to confrontations he would do claim and tell them hey I came from God and that's where I'm going Hallelujah amen speaking to a Pentecostal one-time Angels you know I told him I'm going to heaven I understand your questions yes I said I'm going to heaven amen and he was shaking see how do you know amen that's what the Bible tells me yes that's where I came from amen so that's where I'm going yeah he said ah you you are alive we will meet you in here now that's a man who is going to church singing in church clipping hands saying amen but he's saying I'll meet you in here you know like I told you I said to him you know what if it happens I'll give come for a short sermon and they'll be passing by [Music] Hallelujah doesn't matter preach the gospel anyway when you come to realize who you are sometimes even in prayer is not necessary you speak that way anymore that's what the Bible is that don't worry me don't bother me speak the way amen because they're spoken word is the originals says something he says when a man who has got the Holy Ghost yes takes it away from his heart and he speaks it through his lips he says it's in nothing but the deity so all that you need with you like the woman in zaripat is the word and the Holy Ghost because the woman is in the mirror and the meal is the word of God the oil representing what the Holy Ghost that's what she needs she needed and the miraculous happened because Elijah was there so what are you waiting for Elijah has come you have the weather you have the Holy Ghost so the miraculous mother happy what are you waiting for speak and go forward so she had uh she had the oil in the meal and the prophet came and he spoke Amen on those things and the miraculous happens listen to this last quotation amen brother Brown says uh in the message the junction of time tip number five six zero one one five amen he says um paragraph 107 a leper full of leprosy went to him one day said Lord thou came if thou will can make me clean he touched you said I will be thou clean is that a prayer no he touched you and he spoke to him you see that was not a prayer the Bible simply says he touched you and he said I will be down clean and when omnipotence speaks that's why amen when only putting this speaks miraculous takes place yes he says hallelujah his leprosy vanished like a Sun flying from behind a Cloud Sure omnipotent speaks paragraph one order and says he promised in this last days that he used to speak again Jesus threw the bride the Holy Ghost through the bride is nothing but the egg is speaking if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you have the
