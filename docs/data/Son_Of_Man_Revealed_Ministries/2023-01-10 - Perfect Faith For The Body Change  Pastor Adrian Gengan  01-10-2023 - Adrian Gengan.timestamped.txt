[0:00] [Music]
[0:04] God bless you Saints amen greet you all
[0:07] in the lovely name of our Lord and
[0:08] Savior Jesus
[0:10] Christ when I was asked to give this
[0:12] testimony this morning I forgot to ask
[0:15] Pastor which
[0:17] testimony because there's been so
[0:20] many you know the prophet of God said
[0:23] you know you know like in the book of
[0:26] Acts there were so many things that he
[0:27] couldn't even write and these things are
[0:29] just taking place daily in our lives
[0:32] amen amen but just to give maybe just
[0:35] two things we I just want to read a
[0:38] portion of scripture
[0:39] Mark
[0:41] 11:23 sorry Mark
[0:47] 923 Jesus said unto him if thou can
[0:52] believe all things are possible to him
[0:57] that believe
[0:58] it
[1:01] um just want to give two
[1:02] testimonies uh the Sunday service that
[1:06] uh I've been sitting here and
[1:10] uh recognizing that the angel of God was
[1:13] here amongst
[1:15] us in the service and the anointing feel
[1:19] that anointing and you just know when
[1:20] he's present is you and then I had some
[1:23] discomfort in my ear there was a gland
[1:26] coming up in the inner year and it was
[1:30] and it was very painful it it became so
[1:34] sore during the service that it it was
[1:36] the pain to Su the right to Maria
[1:38] neck and uh I felt that discomfort in
[1:42] the service then Pastor took the
[1:45] quat about the someone at the someone
[1:49] with the problem in the
[1:50] year and uh I knew that that stage that
[1:55] the angel is Discerning my amen so I
[1:58] took it personally to me
[2:00] and I placed my hand on my ear at the
[2:03] end of the service the the swelling the
[2:06] the swelling was gone down and the pain
[2:10] subsided then the next day it became you
[2:13] know when come something come itchy it
[2:15] means healed then I put my hand there
[2:17] and it was not no sign of any swe praise
[2:19] the Lord it was just an itchiness for
[2:21] healing amen so I like to thank and
[2:24] praise God that the angel of God can
[2:27] move through a service but we got to
[2:29] recognize for us amen we got to we got
[2:32] to discern yes that the Lord is speaking
[2:34] to my need amen and no matter what form
[2:36] it may come may come to a word of
[2:38] Correction whatever and say Lord you're
[2:40] speaking to me Lord you are correcting
[2:42] me so we got to recognize the angel of
[2:45] God is here amongst us literally yeah
[2:47] amongst us amen then on uh I don't know
[2:51] I can't remember which day now was a
[2:53] Monday or Tuesday I was at work and
[2:57] uh so I walked into the the
[2:59] administration office at work and
[3:02] there's about one two there's about four
[3:06] four people there about four or five
[3:08] people in the office there and they all
[3:11] had their own desk and computers and
[3:13] phones so as I was there greeted them in
[3:16] the morning and everything said uh as I
[3:18] was
[3:19] leaving this one lady said you know what
[3:23] you a man of God come lay your hands on
[3:25] my phone I'm having a problem with my
[3:27] phone uh and you know the the work phon
[3:30] you get and and I said what's what seems
[3:33] to be the problem with it he said no
[3:35] there the problem from here there's a
[3:37] problem with the connection everybody
[3:38] tried everything I said you take it out
[3:40] and put they said we did everything we
[3:41] could the phone is not working he said
[3:44] but there's a pastor in the other office
[3:47] and he prayed for for his similar
[3:50] situation and God you know he came
[3:53] right
[3:55] then I took the same scripture and I
[3:58] said th can believe all things amen I
[4:01] said the scripture didn't say some
[4:02] things I said all things I saying now
[4:05] you asking me to lay on the Bible said
[4:07] the sign shall follow them that believe
[4:09] when they lay hands the sick they shall
[4:11] recover so it might be a phone might be
[4:13] a phone situation but I believe that if
[4:15] my hands are there I said it must work I
[4:18] didn't say anything negative I said it
[4:20] must work but then in my heart I said
[4:22] Lord if a denominate if this can work
[4:25] through those that are the rainfalls on
[4:27] the just and the unjust if a
[4:28] denomination Minister this person is
[4:31] saying that this miracle took place with
[4:33] a denominational Minister how much you
[4:35] must do it for us now that the people
[4:38] must Rec I said the people need to
[4:39] recognize that you are amongst us Lord
[4:42] and I said this Within Myself and I just
[4:44] and I just quoted them the word I said
[4:46] no the Bible is saying the Bible is very
[4:48] clear he said all things are possible I
[4:51] said not something so I quoted the
[4:52] scripture I said yes it must work now so
[4:55] I said I put I put my hands on it and I
[4:58] just left it and I but I wait but
[4:59] something I wanted to leave but
[5:00] something made me wait within a few
[5:02] second the lady screamed said my phone
[5:04] is
[5:05] working I said praise be to God I said
[5:07] give God a thanks for that give God a
[5:10] thanks because God did that amen amen
[5:11] and even now the phone is working never
[5:13] stopped and everything is no problem
[5:15] they never had a problem so we like to
[5:17] give God the thanks that he's here
[5:18] amongst us and these are the things that
[5:20] he's doing amongst us but the secret is
[5:22] to recognize his presence yeah and
[5:25] recognize what he's doing amen God bless
[5:27] you amen amen

[7:22] Jesus Christ amen hallelujah it's good
[7:25] to be in the house of the Lord amen amen
[7:28] good to worship Him yes amen especially
[7:31] when we know we serving a God who is not
[7:34] dead amen he's a god who's alive and
[7:37] he's showing himself amongst us we don't
[7:39] have to point at a day gone by we can
[7:41] point right now hallelujah amen amen
[7:45] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[7:46] hallelujah let's turn Amen to our Bible
[7:50] amen this evening afternoon there'll be
[7:52] a command service amen with Pastor Tara
[7:55] at the D girl Secondary School 4 p.m.
[7:58] amen and then on wedness Day pastor tar
[8:01] will be here preaching for us amen so
[8:05] amen we invite you all to come to the
[8:06] service and be blessed with the word of
[8:08] the Lord amen I don't if you know the
[8:11] fivefold is here to edify and to build
[8:13] up the body of Christ amen amen we
[8:15] shouldn't be missing these Services amen
[8:17] every opportunity the prophet says when
[8:19] the church doors open we should find
[8:21] ourselves in church amen amen
[8:24] hallelujah and the prophet says when the
[8:26] church doors open we should find
[8:28] ourselves in church amen amen amen
[8:31] praise the Lord amen how if you know the
[8:33] only reason we are all gathered together
[8:35] here is because God sent us a prophet
[8:39] amen without the prophet's message you
[8:41] and I wouldn't have common
[8:43] ground but God sent a message to turn
[8:47] your heart to turn my heart and together
[8:50] how our hearts are being turned amen so
[8:52] praise the Lord for that amen
[8:54] hallelujah amen so we were if you were
[8:58] following the service amen we were
[9:00] dealing with angels and demons and
[9:04] connecting with sons of God in this time
[9:06] and we were really dealing with Genesis
[9:08] Chapter 18 because that's when the
[9:09] angels are coming down amen amen the
[9:12] angels are connecting with the sons of
[9:13] God Abraham and Sarah to give them a
[9:16] message for the body change yes and then
[9:18] the angels are going down to Sodom and
[9:20] gomorra in a time of investigating
[9:23] judgment Amen to bring destruction upon
[9:25] the city so that's why we were dealing
[9:27] with spiritual warfare and showing you
[9:29] the present time and condition how the
[9:32] same influence is upon the earth now in
[9:34] another time like Sodom amen if you're
[9:36] not being influenced by the angels of
[9:38] God now you are being influenced by
[9:40] Fallen Angels there's no two ways about
[9:43] it you are influenced by one set of
[9:47] angels either God's angels or the Fallen
[9:49] Angels amen so that's two Services
[9:51] that's what we were trying to do to show
[9:53] you there amen so maybe we want to
[9:55] progress a bit further into Genesis amen
[9:57] chapter 18 and 19 and maybe we'll do 20
[10:00] and 21 if the Lord permits amen sounds
[10:02] good amen amen praise the Lord amen
[10:06] hallelujah amen so we find just for a
[10:09] little title amen he's bringing a
[10:11] perfect faith for the body change so
[10:14] perfect faith for the body change
[10:16] dealing with Abraham and Sarah right and
[10:18] then on the flip side of that you're
[10:19] going to see the destruction of
[10:21] Sodom amen praise the Lord amen so maybe
[10:24] we can just pick it up from I think we
[10:26] read the first 15 verses the last time
[10:29] of Genesis 18 we can progress a bit
[10:35] further from verse 16 and when the men
[10:38] got up to leave they looked over out
[10:40] over Sodom and Abraham walked along with
[10:42] them to see them
[10:44] off amen you notice now when William
[10:48] brandham he says both men came to me
[10:51] Oral Roberts amen and Billy Graham and
[10:55] then he also says was it t Osborne that
[10:57] came to him amen amen hallelujah amen so
[11:02] the men got up to leave why I'm reading
[11:03] that watch What's Happening Here the men
[11:05] got up to leave and Abraham walked along
[11:07] with them to see them
[11:08] off amen and the Lord said shall I hi
[11:11] from Abraham what I am about to do
[11:14] Abraham will surely become a great and
[11:16] powerful nation and through him all the
[11:18] nations of the earth will be blessed for
[11:20] I have chosen him that he will command
[11:23] his children and his household after him
[11:24] to keep the way of the Lord by doing
[11:26] which is right and just in order that
[11:28] the Lord may bring upon Abraham what he
[11:30] had promised so the Lord is adding
[11:33] nothing back from Abraham and Sarah
[11:36] because it's a type of the seven seal
[11:38] yes amen all the mysteries of God must
[11:41] be revealed am so we've had our Bram
[11:44] amen a type of Abraham yes amen and all
[11:47] the mysteries of God have been revealed
[11:50] amen look at you go look at the sermon
[11:51] titles and you see all the mysteries of
[11:53] God have been revealed to us amen amen
[11:56] so I don't want to labor on that you
[11:57] know that then the Lord said the outcry
[11:59] against Sodom and Gomorrah is great
[12:01] because their sin is so Grievous I will
[12:03] go down to see if the actions fully
[12:05] Justified the outcry that has reached me
[12:07] I'm reading another version amen amen
[12:10] The Cry of it which has come unto me and
[12:12] if not I will know amen and the two men
[12:15] turned away and went to Sodom but
[12:17] Abraham remained standing before the
[12:18] Lord amen you may be seated I don't want
[12:20] to keep you too long here amen so you'll
[12:24] find there that Abraham straight away
[12:25] goes into an intercessory role amen I'm
[12:29] know that inter intercessory role is a
[12:31] Priestly role yes amen amen so how how
[12:34] does he how can he step into the office
[12:36] of a priest did he not meet the image
[12:39] Amen in Genesis 14 King and priest MDC
[12:45] amen so he recognizes his position and
[12:48] he knows that he was made in the image
[12:49] of God so then he steps into the
[12:52] Priestly Priestly role and he starts to
[12:54] intercede so you know they come from 50
[12:56] 40 30 20 and they come down to 10 and
[13:00] they say if I find 10 righteous in the
[13:02] city I will not destroy the
[13:05] city yeah amen hallelujah amen now you
[13:10] notice something here about Abraham he
[13:12] was immediately able to recognize his
[13:16] day amen when he saw the Angels coming
[13:20] immediately he recognized his day amen
[13:23] yes now he's been going through years of
[13:26] preparation like how we were going
[13:28] through years of the preparation amen
[13:31] okay so you read how he came out of
[13:33] Babylon very quickly I'm going to
[13:34] summarize this you remember how he came
[13:36] out of Babylon and he was not partakers
[13:38] of their
[13:40] sins he left everything to follow the
[13:42] voice of God Amen and the Lord would
[13:45] bless him abundantly with sheep cattle
[13:47] donkeys men's servant maid servant and
[13:50] camels yes amen hallelujah then the word
[13:53] of God calls for a total separation from
[13:56] unbelief amen so notice now the some of
[13:59] these things are the titles of the
[14:00] prophet and what I'm trying to do is
[14:02] show you how prophetic the message is
[14:04] amen amen amen so God is calling for a
[14:08] to Total separation from unbelief so he
[14:10] has to separate from
[14:12] lot amen some of us feel like we are
[14:15] separating from a lot amen when we leave
[14:18] the things of the world and follow
[14:19] Christ amen it feels like we have to
[14:22] sacrifice a lot but God wants us to
[14:24] leave lot amen amen so he gives remember
[14:28] now his name natur his character he
[14:29] gives lot First Choice amen over the
[14:33] land that God had promised
[14:35] him God promised Abraham the land but
[14:38] he's given lot First Choice amen amen so
[14:41] lot chooses the plains of
[14:43] Jordan all the way to zoah the well
[14:46] watered Plains and the Bible calls it it
[14:50] was like the garden of the
[14:52] Lord amen so what did he do he went and
[14:55] set up a denominational Church in
[14:57] Sodom and he had a sister branch in
[15:01] gomorra amen his ministry was
[15:03] thriving amen his ministry was
[15:06] flourishing so much that he became a
[15:08] leader in the city right amen amen
[15:12] hallelujah and at this time God
[15:15] reconfirms when lot separates God comes
[15:18] and reconfirms his Covenant with Abram
[15:21] and God is wanting you to separate from
[15:23] all forms of unbelief amen so that he
[15:26] can come and establish his Covenant with
[15:28] you
[15:29] I don't think you heard me God is
[15:31] wanting you to separate from all forms
[15:33] of
[15:34] unbelief yes Lord amen because he's
[15:37] coming now at this time to confirm his
[15:40] Covenant with you this is a serious hour
[15:42] church it's a serious time amen
[15:45] amen amen now is not the time to be relx
[15:49] now is not the time to be lukewarm amen
[15:51] it's a season of body change perfect
[15:53] faith has come in this hour to prepare
[15:55] us for a body change amen that may sound
[15:59] like a a fairy tale to you that may
[16:01] sound like a m to you amen hallelujah
[16:04] but we are believing for the second
[16:05] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen to
[16:07] change our physical
[16:09] bodies
[16:11] amen yes thank you Lord
[16:15] amen my question to you is are you
[16:17] willing to lay down everything and get
[16:19] rid of all unbelief amen
[16:22] yes amen L thank I'm going to re ask a
[16:26] question some of you didn't hear
[16:29] are you
[16:31] willing to lay down everything and get
[16:34] rid of all
[16:35] unbelief
[16:37] amen please don't use my God like an
[16:41] Aaron
[16:43] boy only when you have a need then you
[16:46] want to make things right and ask the
[16:48] Lord why don't you live in the fullness
[16:50] of his glory why don't you live in it
[16:53] every day amen amen
[16:56] hallelujah amen
[16:59] you find
[17:01] here that in I'm still summarizing
[17:04] Genesis 13:14 but I've got to speak
[17:06] certain things here when he separates
[17:08] from lot because God won't ask you to do
[17:10] something without rewarding you oh thank
[17:14] you the moment he separates from
[17:17] lot amen the moment he separates from
[17:21] lot amen thank you Lord God tells him

[17:47] of Israel like they did but God gave it
[17:50] to them and it will always belong to
[17:51] them yes am God is not an Indian giver

[27:04] to word but uh Abraham I want you to
[27:07] know something I'm going to condescend
[27:08] even further I'm going to come from this

[27:13] these
[27:15] days amen
[27:19] hallelujah that's Genesis 14 The Mystery
[27:22] of God is revealed to him then we come
[27:24] to Genesis 15 and Abram is found there
[27:26] in the beginning of Genesis 15 he's
[27:28] updating his family
[27:30] will he's met with his
[27:33] lawyers he's met with the people who
[27:34] does the will and they asked him who
[27:36] will be your Heir and he tells him
[27:40] Ela of
[27:42] Damascus I have no
[27:44] hair so they put the all belongings of
[27:48] Abraham will go to elezar of
[27:53] Damascus and the Lord hears him I'm
[27:56] dramatizing it now right
[27:58] right the Lord hears him amen
[28:01] hallelujah and he tells him he
[28:04] reconfirms the Covenant with Abram and
[28:06] tells him one from your own body oh
[28:12] yes yes Lord will be air yes now he
[28:16] tells him take your eyes off the dust

[28:31] hallelujah praise the Lord look at the
[28:34] stars and see if you able to number them
[28:37] amen then he makes him do a blood
[28:39] sacrifice you know the slaying of
[28:41] animals now my question to you
[28:45] is are you looking for the promise out
[28:47] of another person God is selling you out
[28:49] of your own body yes amen out of you
[28:53] shall come the Life of
[28:54] Christ amen yes he coming in Genesis 15
[28:58] to tell you out of your own body Genesis
[29:01] 16 you know they moving to the
[29:03] permissive will and now there's AA
[29:05] involved they're going into permissive
[29:06] will amen there's still some doubt and
[29:08] reasoning going on
[29:11] there amen time is
[29:14] passing but in Genesis day 16 amen
[29:18] you'll find that there's a ishma is not
[29:21] born Genesis 16 Genesis 17:
[29:26] 19
[29:28] now before there's any seed Sarah is
[29:31] still old Abram is still
[29:33] old there's no promise of a son what
[29:37] does he say there in
[29:38] 1719 Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a
[29:41] son and you shall call his name Isaac
[29:45] God knows all your children before you
[29:46] ever had them and he knows their
[29:50] names some of you not reading this with
[29:53] me this is before the birth of
[29:55] Isaac who is this that knows what child
[29:58] you'll have what gender amen who is this
[30:02] amen they didn't go to a doctor for a
[30:05] sonogram to reveal the
[30:08] gender Amen in fact God spoiled it for
[30:11] them they they couldn't have a gender
[30:13] reveal
[30:14] party Sarah says Ah must now no gender
[30:18] reveal God said it's going to be a male
[30:20] child it's going to be Isaac and now no
[30:23] name revealing no christening service
[30:25] the Lord already told him you going to
[30:26] name him they want to name him nine boy
[30:29] but this is no nine boy this is going to
[30:31] be Isaac
[30:33] amen amen I will establish my Covenant
[30:37] with him for an Everlasting Covenant
[30:39] amen amen praise the Lord amen then we
[30:43] find that in Genesis 17 amen all this is
[30:46] preparing for Genesis 18 we're almost
[30:48] back at Genesis 18 now Abraham is having
[30:51] a new birth you say New Birth yes yes
[30:56] because what does the changing of name
[30:59] signify name signifies the nature of a
[31:02] person amen so he's getting a new nature
[31:06] he's getting a new birth
[31:10] Hallelujah Abram means exalted
[31:13] father but Abraham means father of
[31:17] many hallelujah amen God is changing his
[31:21] name to fit his role he doesn't want him
[31:24] to be an exalted father with no seed he
[31:27] tell him I'm going to make you a father
[31:28] of many nations so God changes his name
[31:31] to Abraham and gives him a sign of
[31:33] circumcision which is a sign of the Holy
[31:36] Ghost amen amen come on now you got to
[31:39] read between the line here Abraham is
[31:42] getting a new nature he's getting a new
[31:44] birth and he's getting the baptism of
[31:46] the Holy Ghost amen after all of these
[31:49] things now comes Genesis
[31:52] 18 after the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[31:56] don't think you're getting this
[31:57] after the sign of circumcision after
[32:00] he's sealed after he's done the things
[32:03] he's waiting for the promise
[32:07] amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord oh
[32:12] he's good isn't he amen amen here's
[32:15] something amazing amen you can find it
[32:16] here amen hallelujah you find it here in
[32:20] I think it's Genesis
[32:23] 13 go there quickly Genesis 13
[32:28] Verse 18 the last verse there I want you
[32:31] to see this he he repositions himself
[32:35] Abram removed his tent and came and
[32:37] dwelt in the Plaine of mamre mamre means
[32:39] strength right which is in Eon and built
[32:42] an altar unto the Lord right so he's at
[32:44] this place in Genesis Chapter 18 now in
[32:50] mam that's how the verse starts right
[32:53] 181 coming to the plains of mam so what
[32:56] am I telling you Abram was living in one
[32:58] place in Jeffersonville but he
[33:00] repositioned himself to meet the angel
[33:02] of the
[33:07] Lord amen he had to go west yes to
[33:10] connect with the Angel's message
[33:13] yes and he comes Now by The Oaks of
[33:16] memory The Plains of memory and he's
[33:19] sitting at the tent door there right we
[33:21] read all of this I'm I'm just giving you
[33:23] this the the brief summary of this
[33:25] things we're not going to really go into
[33:26] that
[33:27] but here we find in Genesis 18
[33:31] now his heart is going to be turned back
[33:34] Amen to the god of Enoch and the god of
[33:37] Noah amen amen amen Abraham like we said
[33:41] he immediately able to recognize the
[33:43] presence of God able to recognize his
[33:45] day and his message so he immediately
[33:48] recognized it's God with two angels amen
[33:51] and he goes to entertaining them and
[33:52] that's what we've been dealing with with
[33:53] the last couple of servants how to
[33:55] entertain his presence how to entertain
[33:57] Angels getting our lives right getting
[34:00] everything right amen being able to
[34:02] entertain his presence amen and then
[34:06] Sarah is sitting there without a prayer
[34:11] card she sitting in the tent she's got
[34:14] no prayer card right but she don't need
[34:17] a prayer card amen because the sign of
[34:19] the son of man is going to be
[34:21] performed amen amen and with his back
[34:24] turned to them he would call out that
[34:26] person that person and with his back I'm
[34:29] talking about William brandom now in his
[34:31] meetings he would call out the sickness
[34:33] you sister there in the back amen call
[34:36] out the name call out the sickness call
[34:39] out the address
[34:41] yes same sign amen same one yes doing it
[34:47] amen he's able to recognize the sign
[34:50] just like how you were able to recognize
[34:52] the sign you are sitting here because
[34:53] you recognize Luke 17:30 you didn't come
[34:56] here out of marriage you didn't come
[34:58] here amen because you sympathize with
[34:59] the message you are sitting here today
[35:01] because you're a believer of the message
[35:03] of the
[35:04] hour thank
[35:06] you thank you Lord amen so she's sitting
[35:10] there the prophet say she was a little
[35:11] fuss in all of these things but now when
[35:13] the gift starts to
[35:14] move and discerns her heart and tells
[35:18] exactly what's wrong with
[35:20] her amen what is it a message coming to
[35:24] move you into perfect faith because
[35:27] what's needed for the body change
[35:29] perfect Faith so it must be a message to
[35:31] move Sarah into perfect Faith but this
[35:34] message has a dual purpose it's coming
[35:37] with a message of perfect Faith to put
[35:39] Faith in the heart of Abraham and Sarah
[35:41] but it's also going to now go to Sodom
[35:44] to amen do a time of investigating
[35:48] judgment and pronounce judgment over
[35:52] Sodom now the sin in Sodom is so great
[35:55] that laws have been passed to legalize
[35:58] homosexuality you say see it softly I
[36:00] said laws have been passed to legalize
[36:04] homosexuality you saying talk softer but
[36:07] it's against the word of the Lord to be
[36:08] a homosexual amen yes Lord who's
[36:12] controlling my volume here put a speaker
[36:14] out
[36:15] there
[36:19] right thank you Lord we got too many
[36:23] backslid people in the message who
[36:24] sympathize with their gay cousins and
[36:26] the friends Lord have mercy amen they're
[36:30] good people they're good for a burning
[36:33] that's right
[36:36] amen
[36:37] hallelujah yes do you know what happened
[36:39] to Lot son-in-laws they burned in Sodom
[36:42] right
[36:46] amen if you go read Genesis 19 the
[36:48] Angels tell him speak to your
[36:50] son-in-laws
[36:52] yeah but they refuse friends family that
[36:55] they had meals with
[36:57] they had bries with they had fun times
[37:01] with they even had
[37:05] sleepovers but they burned in
[37:09] Sodom
[37:13] yes God don't care for your
[37:17] open-mindedness that's correct you need
[37:20] your mind
[37:21] examined hello yes that's right God
[37:25] didn't update his gospel to say okay
[37:26] okay maybe I was a bit
[37:28] wrong God hates sin God's word will
[37:31] still stand yes amen hallelujah amen
[37:36] praise the Lord amen now if you find
[37:40] what happens here lot is not shocked by
[37:43] what's going on so means he's already
[37:46] aware of the situation he's aware of the
[37:49] perversion it's legalized yes did we get
[37:53] it legalized under this Obama yes yes
[37:59] yes now the alab people rights were
[38:02] being
[38:03] exalted you're saying what's the
[38:05] alphabet people we start with a b c d
[38:09] they start with
[38:12] LGB
[38:14] amen the alphabet people's rights were
[38:17] being exalted and
[38:19] promoted the first time this year they
[38:21] had an entire month exalting and
[38:24] promoting this thing yes so what happens
[38:29] the Riders changing to
[38:32] black demon powers have come upon the
[38:35] people yes you see when you're reading
[38:38] The Story You're just reading out the
[38:39] men of Sodom kind demon powers right
[38:42] came to unite with religion and politics
[38:46] because through politics They are
[38:47] promoting this thing through politics
[38:50] they are passing legislation to legalize
[38:53] it so here the black hor writer is
[38:55] writing demon powers are there through
[38:57] Sodom and Gomorrah and through all the
[39:00] plains
[39:02] amen and lot you saw aware of these
[39:05] things but he's accustomed to their
[39:06] sinful ways that the Bible says his
[39:09] righteous Soul was vexed but he did
[39:12] nothing to take his family out of that
[39:16] condition lot could have left with his
[39:18] family at any time that's correct but he
[39:20] did not leave his
[39:25] denomination
[39:27] amen hallelujah amen who which one of
[39:30] you want to leave your family in that
[39:32] situation in a city that's
[39:35] so
[39:37] sinful
[39:38] amen he didn't want to take his family
[39:41] out of the situation he became a
[39:43] compromiser and he was even willing to
[39:45] offer his virgin daughters to these
[39:47] perverted
[39:48] men to save The
[39:51] Messengers amen now we know that not
[39:54] much could be done to save the city
[39:56] because of the wickedness of the people
[39:58] so what are we saying they were
[40:00] preaching to the
[40:01] L no evangelism could be done they
[40:05] didn't give them room for
[40:08] evangelism these men saw these angels
[40:11] enter lot's house and they came knocking
[40:13] at the door where are these men that
[40:15] have come into your house there was no
[40:17] time to look for the
[40:19] 10 the 10 that Abraham bargained for
[40:22] there was no time for
[40:25] evangelism
[40:32] amen hallelujah they did not get the 10
[40:35] that they were looking for so the Angels
[40:37] asked lot to speak to his son-in-laws
[40:39] but they will not listen his message was
[40:41] strange to them you telling about about
[40:43] angels coming
[40:47] down but the Angels eventually take lot
[40:50] by the hand take his daughter by the
[40:53] hand take his wife by the hand and they
[40:56] drag them out of the city amen and tell
[40:59] them flee to the
[41:01] mountains but now Lot's wife has got a
[41:05] son-in-law or daughters in Sodom and who
[41:09] knows if they got children or
[41:11] grandchildren
[41:13] there and a heart can't help right but
[41:18] turn
[41:21] back and
[41:23] look at the city being destroyed
[41:28] now is not the time to turn back
[41:31] amen amen look at it you would think ah
[41:34] it's just a human it's a human emotion
[41:37] my my grandchild is being burnt in that
[41:39] City can't I look back God said Don't
[41:42] Look Back yes
[41:47] amen it sounds like a heartless thing
[41:50] but we're dealing with God here
[41:53] amen amen we can't be trying to serve
[41:56] God in the message of the hour and we
[41:58] got one hand in the
[41:59] world two hands in the
[42:02] world while the Angels God is one foot
[42:04] on land and sea we think we got one foot
[42:07] in the church and one foot in the
[42:11] world amen amen hallelujah we feed the
[42:15] spirit man a cold meal once a week but
[42:19] we try and feed the flesh man three art
[42:21] meals a
[42:23] day something is wrong how many of you
[42:26] know we are not going to make it out of
[42:27] this life in the human flesh based on
[42:30] the human flesh right it's the spirit
[42:32] man inside of you that's rising up to
[42:34] bring this flesh under subjection and
[42:36] one of these days his flesh has to give
[42:38] way to change amen yes Lord yes thank
[42:43] you sounds ridiculous amen but I'm
[42:46] telling you the word of God is quick
[42:47] it's powerful the Bible says that our
[42:50] very atom shall be changed in the moment
[42:51] in the twinkling of an
[42:53] eye amen these body shall be changed
[42:57] Hallelujah yes thank you
[43:02] Jesus praise the Lord amen
[43:06] hallelujah now you know the prophet had
[43:09] a a vision and in the seventh Vision
[43:11] what did he see anybody can remember
[43:14] what the seventh Vision
[43:17] was amen don't be afraid to say it loud
[43:19] brother raes just I just need one person
[43:21] to just say what that
[43:25] was amen yes praise the

[43:33] please you can put this
[43:36] up just give you this
[43:38] s amen praise the
[43:41] Lord so he saw in the seventh
[43:43] Vision America go up in a great big
[43:46] cloud of
[43:47] smoke and why was that
[43:51] happening because it had reached another
[43:53] time of Sodom and gomorra that's right
[43:56] amen they would
[43:57] not
[44:03] amen they were not aren to the voice of
[44:06] William Brandon that's correct they
[44:08] rejected their day and their message yes
[44:11] that's
[44:13] right amen so all of them will now have
[44:18] to go through the tribulation period
[44:21] because rapturing Faith only comes via
[44:24] the message of the hour
[44:27] amen yes
[44:30] amen and rapturing Faith only comes by
[44:34] the message of the hour amen not Joseph
[44:36] Prince right no not Billy Graham amen
[44:40] Oral Roberts Joel oin TD Jakes rapturing
[44:45] Faith does not lie in their
[44:48] messages motivational speeches lies in
[44:51] their
[44:53] messages amen yeah Hallelujah yes but I
[44:56] want to show you how Abraham because
[44:58] we're always typing Abraham with Bram
[45:00] but I want to show you a scripture here
[45:02] that that will really show you how he
[45:04] also saw Sodom go
[45:06] up amen so have we got the slide there
[45:10] yeah it says early the next morning this
[45:12] is Genesis 19:7 now Abram got up and
[45:15] returned to the place where he stood
[45:17] before the Lord he looked down towards
[45:19] Sodom and Gora and all of the land of
[45:22] the plain he saw smoke rising from the
[45:24] land like smoke from a
[45:27] furnace and listen how close that is now
[45:29] to William Brandon's Vision the last and
[45:31] seven Vision was where I heard a most
[45:33] terrible explosion and I turned and
[45:35] looked and I saw nothing but debris
[45:37] craters and smoke all over the land of
[45:40] America oh yes you see how similar that
[45:43] scene is
[45:44] yeah yes amen now if God doesn't judge
[45:49] this world for their sin and their
[45:51] condition the prophet says he's got to
[45:53] raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and
[45:55] apologize to
[45:58] them amen the next slide this is where
[46:02] we are now the Gentiles are called out
[46:06] and I want to hear you all say Amen the
[46:07] bride is ready amen the Rapture is at
[46:10] end yes he says can we realize that can
[46:13] we actually believe that is it a story
[46:16] that's been told is it a m to us is it
[46:20] something that sounds real yes is it
[46:22] something that we outside can believe or
[46:24] is it something that's in US that's part
[46:26] of us that is more than life to us he
[46:30] says and I'm going to ask you the
[46:31] question this morning what attitude do
[46:34] we set in this morning in the
[46:38] Tabernacle amen What attitude do are we
[46:41] sitting here now he says remember it'll
[46:43] be a small flock that receives
[46:46] it now in the Homeland waiting for the
[46:49] trumpets oh watch what the Jews are
[46:51] waiting for how many if you know what
[46:52] the Jews are waiting for anybody
[46:54] knows
[46:57] now yeah the prophet's going to tell us
[46:58] right let's read it they're waiting in
[47:00] the Homeland for the trumpets they are
[47:02] waiting for the going of the little
[47:04] bride
[47:06] am
[47:08] amen amen so that Revelation 11 can be
[47:12] fulfilled what are they waiting for for
[47:15] you and I to
[47:18] go the church age has seized the seals
[47:21] has been opened that prove what they
[47:23] left out in the church age and the
[47:25] message has been given Israel is on the
[47:28] scene ready for the Feast of trumpets
[47:31] yes
[47:33] amen now I want to bring these things
[47:36] here because we're talking about it in
[47:37] the message anointed ones at the end
[47:39] time the prophet says three things have
[47:41] been fulfilled and three things lay
[47:43] before you right
[47:45] now he says first the world is in a
[47:48] Sodom
[47:49] condition Jesus said it would happen
[47:52] look at the perversion our women trying
[47:54] to act like men can you
[47:57] agree our men trying to act like
[48:00] women yes can you
[48:03] agree
[48:04] sified rotten filthy low down devil
[48:09] possessed and don't know it the Bible
[48:12] says that would happen and that's where
[48:14] it's
[48:15] at these three things now right you're
[48:18] taking note of the first one we reading
[48:20] about Sodom in Genesis 19 there the
[48:23] world now is in a Sodom condition
[48:26] yes is he being prophetic here when he's
[48:30] saying three things lay before you right
[48:32] now remember he's a prophet
[48:35] amen secondly in that hour according to
[48:40] the scripture that Janice and jamas
[48:43] appears have we had false impersonations
[48:46] yes have now we got the most amount of
[48:48] prophets trying to prophesy on the
[48:51] earth I think we got the most amount of
[48:53] prophets here in Africa right right
[48:56] amen they got Doom yeah and they got
[49:00] gloom and they got
[49:04] grass amen
[49:08] hallelujah Janice and jamus
[49:11] appears thirdly it's the same hour that
[49:14] the son of man is to be revealed
[49:17] amen there is your believer your make
[49:20] believer and your unbeliever there is a
[49:23] genuine word standing out Vindicated
[49:26] there is the make believer impersonating
[49:27] it and there is the unbeliever rejecting
[49:31] the whole
[49:32] thing now which group are you are you 1
[49:35] 2 or three
[49:38] amen are you 1 2 or three tell me what
[49:40] number you
[49:42] are somebody is one
[49:45] okay
[49:50] hey let's personalize it you in a Sodom
[49:53] condition no so why are you saying one
[49:56] one hey who's exposing themselves
[50:01] in so the world is in a I'm asking you
[50:04] to identify your
[50:06] PA so we not number one anyone here
[50:10] Janice and
[50:12] jamas are we number three amen have we
[50:14] seen the son of man being
[50:18] revealed let me ask you quickly and
[50:20] maybe I'll tell you so for the younger
[50:22] ones who don't know what is the son of
[50:24] man revealed
[50:27] so Jesus came in three sons
[50:30] name right so he came a son of man when
[50:33] he was here born on the Earth son of man
[50:34] means Prophet that's right Prophet God
[50:37] in a prophet God in a body of Flesh amen
[50:40] and Jesus operated in Son of Man
[50:41] Ministry then when he resurrected and he
[50:44] he went up to ascended up to heaven he
[50:46] he moved in a Ministry of Son of God
[50:49] which is through the Holy Ghost amen
[50:51] through 2,000
[50:53] years right
[50:56] then in the Millennium you'll be son of
[50:59] David but now the mystery of Luke 17:30
[51:02] is this that in between Son of God which
[51:05] is the Holy Ghost and Son of David he
[51:09] comes back as son of man in Luke 17:30
[51:12] amen but he doesn't physically come back
[51:15] on the earth he uses a prophet's body
[51:17] that's
[51:18] right I don't know if you're just
[51:20] listening and and hearing what I'm
[51:22] saying or you hearing it for the first
[51:24] time or you don't believe that
[51:26] but this is the message of the hour this
[51:28] is exactly what we believe exactly amen
[51:31] that Jesus
[51:33] Christ came and he used the body of
[51:37] William Brandon that's right and that he
[51:40] the one who could discern the hearts
[51:42] because no man can discern Hearts amen
[51:45] praise the
[51:47] Lord you see the next slide here I
[51:50] wasn't the one that appeared down on the
[51:51] river I was only standing there when he
[51:54] appeared amen I'm not the one that
[51:56] performs these things and for tells
[51:58] these things that happen as perfect as
[51:59] they are I'm only the one that's near
[52:01] when he does it I was only a voice that
[52:04] he used to say it it wasn't what I knew
[52:08] it's what I just surrendered myself to I
[52:10] hope you're learning here amen that he
[52:12] spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the
[52:15] seventh angel oh no it was the
[52:17] manifestation of the son of man it
[52:19] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[52:22] mystery of God unfolded it's not a man
[52:26] it's God the angel was not the son of
[52:29] man he was the messenger from the son of
[52:31] man the son of man is
[52:34] Christ he is the one that you're feeding
[52:36] on you're not feeding on a man a man his
[52:40] words will fail but you're feeding on
[52:42] the unfailing body word of the son of
[52:45] man which is Jesus Christ give God
[52:47] praise
[52:48] [Applause]
[52:50] amen now he says if you haven't fully
[52:52] fed on every word to give yourself
[52:55] strength to Fly Above All these
[52:56] denominations and things of this world
[52:59] will you at this time do it while we
[53:03] pray
[53:05] amen
[53:07] hallelujah now we find coming to our
[53:10] current setting now and you watch how
[53:12] the prophet places this year because
[53:14] sometimes he says things in a way that
[53:15] will make you
[53:17] understand he's preaching here in the
[53:18] message recognizing your day and we look
[53:20] how Abraham recognized his day he's he's
[53:24] now telling you that
[53:25] Russia has recognized her
[53:27] place is Russia in place
[53:32] now she has to do it to do
[53:36] what somebody read help me brother Caleb
[53:39] she's here in place to do
[53:42] what
[53:44] fulfill
[53:46] scure now she leads the world in science
[53:50] we're way back behind her all the rest
[53:52] of the world is behind her she leads a
[53:55] the place now he's giving you the reason
[53:57] why Russia recognized herself you see
[54:00] this is a time where everyone recognizes
[54:02] who they
[54:03] are the pope
[54:05] USA Russia the
[54:08] Jews and the bride reason Russia came to
[54:13] herself she had
[54:15] to just like Israel had to get in the
[54:18] Homeland God had to drive Israel back to
[54:21] the Homeland for the trumpets so did God
[54:25] have to drive Russia up there to do
[54:29] exactly what's been prophesied she would
[54:31] do is that why she's there
[54:34] now is that what he's telling you Russia
[54:37] is in a place to do exactly what God
[54:39] prophesied her to do
[54:45] amen see it's a time of recognition
[54:48] you've got to recognized the world is
[54:50] recognized the nation has recognized
[54:52] science is recognized the devil has
[54:54] recog recogniz it's time that he can
[54:56] wreck women wreck the church wreck
[54:58] people he's recognized it and God has
[55:00] recognized that there is people on Earth
[55:02] that he has predestinated to life glory
[55:06] amen hallelujah
[55:09] [Applause]
[55:11] am amen he recognized
[55:14] that this is the time to send his
[55:16] message amen he did it the people has
[55:19] recognized it the bright time has
[55:21] realized the evening light amen if Sodom
[55:24] had be recognized her day when she seen
[55:27] those Messengers come down there like
[55:28] Billy Graham and all Roberts but she
[55:30] didn't
[55:32] right if Sodom had recognized the
[55:34] messenger she would have been standing
[55:36] today Jesus said if she'd have
[55:38] recognized the same as Abraham
[55:40] recognized Abraham knowed that there was
[55:42] a promised son coming he know that there
[55:44] had to be a chain some way because he
[55:46] was too old and so as Sarah but when he
[55:49] saw the one who could discern the
[55:50] thoughts
[55:52] amen of Sarah behind him he recognized
[55:55] the hour he was living he recognized
[55:58] that God was speaking to him out of
[56:00] human flesh he recognized the sign and
[56:03] was blessed of the Lord Sodom didn't
[56:05] recognize the day and was burnt up and
[56:07] Jesus says As it was in the day so shall
[56:09] it be when the son of man has been man
[56:12] manifest and he says well the
[56:14] denominational Church there has not
[56:15] recognized her
[56:17] day right he says here the National
[56:20] Force put Israel in a Homeland and I
[56:22] want you to give you an update now he's
[56:24] not talking about
[56:25] that back then right now Russia is
[56:27] driving them back to their
[56:29] Homeland still driving them back the war
[56:32] is increasing and increasing the largest
[56:35] population of Jews outside of Israel was
[56:38] in Eastern Europe but the war now has
[56:41] made it uncomfortable for them and the
[56:44] largest amount of Jews have been
[56:45] returning back to the Homeland amen amen
[56:48] and could it be that that's why the
[56:50] angels are holding back the
[56:52] winds waiting for all the Jews to go
[56:54] back back go back not only were they in
[56:58] Ukraine they were also in
[57:00] Russia right and in Poland and all of
[57:02] these Eastern European countries there
[57:04] but they all going back go and do a
[57:06] search use Google and make it work for
[57:08] you and go and see how many Jews have
[57:11] gone back to Israel since the Russian
[57:14] Ukraine
[57:15] war go type it there how many Jews have
[57:18] returned back to Israel since the
[57:20] Ukraine Russia
[57:22] War so what's putting it the Wars and
[57:26] strife National Force and what's
[57:29] National Force you see what's going to
[57:31] happen here the National Force calls you
[57:33] to put a mask
[57:35] on National force caus you to stay at
[57:38] home National Force made you stop coming
[57:41] to church I'm trying to bring it to
[57:43] reality right National Force says you
[57:45] couldn't
[57:46] gather so he's saying National Force
[57:49] because that what will happen now
[57:51] will'll put the church that's the
[57:54] denominational now in the world Council
[57:56] of
[57:57] churches do you know right now remember
[58:01] the people don't know what's going on if
[58:03] I belong to a church and the head of
[58:06] that church is signed up with the Pope
[58:08] and signed up with the World Council of
[58:09] churches I am not aware of it I thinking
[58:12] I'm innocent I'm just going to
[58:17] church but you know even in
[58:20] law the guy sitting in the car waiting
[58:23] to make a getaway is equally as guilty
[58:26] as the one in the in the bank
[58:28] robbing right they'll both get charged
[58:31] for the same
[58:35] crime so somebody sitting in the Pew and
[58:38] just because he doesn't know what's
[58:40] going up on up there they'll all be
[58:41] guilty of the same crime
[58:44] amen he says so watch now there's
[58:48] National Force but then there's the
[58:50] power of God Amen the power of God has
[58:54] put the people in The
[58:56] Bride right I'm reading that as past
[58:58] tense because that has happened the
[59:00] spirit of God which is the word of God
[59:02] will put the bride in her
[59:05] place she'll recognize a position in the
[59:08] word then she's in Christ will put her
[59:11] in a place the power of God will raise
[59:14] the bride into Glory out of it amen oh
[59:18] people recognize your day as Jesus want
[59:21] the sign of Sodom the church conditions
[59:23] of this day look body said in this day
[59:25] will take place the sign of Sodom would
[59:27] take place in this day sign like Abraham
[59:30] the day before Sodom
[59:32] amen now look at what the son of man
[59:35] came to do here right I'm going to close
[59:37] now he says he promised to send you
[59:39] Heavenly light to ripen the word seed
[59:42] that would be swn for this day amen the
[59:44] seed is here the seed is
[59:46] the is the
[59:50] Bible okay let's slow that down he sent
[59:56] the Heavenly light to ripen the word
[59:59] seed but how if you know if you leave
[1:00:01] seed here if this is a seed can it
[1:00:05] produce
[1:00:07] anything what must you do
[1:00:10] dig you got to bury the
[1:00:12] seed right you got to bury the seed and
[1:00:16] then you got to cover it with dirt then
[1:00:18] you've got to get it enough sunlight and
[1:00:20] water and leave
[1:00:22] it no farmer ever digs every week to
[1:00:26] check how it's
[1:00:27] growing when you speak a word of faith
[1:00:30] when you speaking over your situation
[1:00:32] when you believing God for anything stop
[1:00:34] going to Red dig
[1:00:36] it you got to approach it like a
[1:00:39] farmer you saw the word by faith but
[1:00:42] every day you are doubting and reasoning
[1:00:43] will it happen will it happen I wonder
[1:00:45] if the seed is growing a farmer doesn't
[1:00:47] worry a farm has F to believe in the law
[1:00:50] of God that if I put a seed into the
[1:00:52] ground the natural law of God says that
[1:00:55] amen every seed must bring forth of its
[1:00:57] kind
[1:00:58] amen so I'm sewing the word by
[1:01:04] faith looks like it's a season of
[1:01:06] praying over his phones brother
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:09] Joshua amen hallelujah last night my
[1:01:13] wife I just showed a miracle
[1:01:16] instant
[1:01:18] amen so we fixed the phone on wedness
[1:01:21] day was it wedness day I think it was
[1:01:23] wedness day w Wednesday or Thursday
[1:01:26] could have been Thursday brand new
[1:01:28] screen everything but this phone has
[1:01:31] been water damaged
[1:01:32] before so there's always problems with
[1:01:36] electronics right and brother Joshua
[1:01:39] introduced me to a very nice guy that
[1:01:41] does our work and sometimes I feel bad
[1:01:43] because now he knows me because of my
[1:01:45] association with brother Joshua so he
[1:01:47] doesn't charge us labor it make us pay
[1:01:50] for the
[1:01:51] part now if you keep taking the same
[1:01:53] phone back to him all the time he's
[1:01:55] going to think you're taking advantage
[1:01:57] of him right and the last time when I
[1:02:00] took the phone back to him he replaced
[1:02:02] the screen free because the screen was
[1:02:05] defective after 2 days because of the
[1:02:08] water damage that runs through the phone
[1:02:10] that trigger something and the screen
[1:02:12] stops working you'll hear messages
[1:02:13] coming through but the screen is
[1:02:16] black so anyway the last time he didn't
[1:02:18] tell me he replaced the screen free and
[1:02:21] he gave me the
[1:02:22] phone so anyway way when he fixed it
[1:02:25] this time and yesterday so I spoke to my
[1:02:29] wife in the morning with the same phone
[1:02:30] it worked and then I get a call from
[1:02:33] Autumn later to tell me Mommy's phone is
[1:02:34] not working the screen is just black
[1:02:36] doesn't want to come on and she says
[1:02:39] brother Caleb might try to come home for
[1:02:41] something and whatever amen so when
[1:02:44] brother came the phone did I tell you
[1:02:46] the phone's not working
[1:02:49] okay so anyway I left it I was fed up
[1:02:52] with the phone I wasn't moving in Fai
[1:02:54] I'm thinking you know this phone is Du
[1:02:56] for upgrade anytime anyway so I'm not
[1:02:58] going to bother about this phone I I
[1:03:00] when when I just looked at it and I
[1:03:02] tried to put it on I see it's not coming
[1:03:04] on but I can hear it's on you know
[1:03:05] you're getting vibrations on that phone
[1:03:07] so I left it back there anyway go to
[1:03:09] starting in the night I'm coming there
[1:03:12] and I'm getting some water and then my
[1:03:14] eyes fall upon the phone but different
[1:03:15] anointing now amen amen amen am so I
[1:03:20] look at this phone and I said come I
[1:03:24] took phone in my hand and I said
[1:03:27] Lord your word
[1:03:31] declares and I'm I'm thinking now of St
[1:03:33] John amen when Jesus is talking about
[1:03:36] he's the resurrection and the
[1:03:37] life and he says he that is dead though

[1:04:29] do that because you know we are praying
[1:04:31] God to God for other things
[1:04:34] yes that would seem like you want him to
[1:04:36] work in this
[1:04:39] situation but God is moving us to
[1:04:42] perfect Faith oh yes amen amen now if
[1:04:46] you noticed here last week too we
[1:04:48] switched the camera off when we were
[1:04:50] praying for sister Maggie right because
[1:04:53] it's not our in intention to go and
[1:04:56] promote ourselves out there and like be
[1:04:58] boastful about what God is doing in the
[1:05:01] church yes amen this is a local church
[1:05:04] it's a sovereign church and God knows
[1:05:06] how to work with the Sovereign church
[1:05:08] now it's important for you to recognize
[1:05:10] the gift of God amen amen amen
[1:05:15] hallelujah you may be thinking that I'm
[1:05:17] not operating a gift but I am operating
[1:05:19] a gift that is why you are seeing the
[1:05:21] results in the church amen is that
[1:05:24] because of a gift in operation amen it
[1:05:27] may not be a flamboyan gift or
[1:05:28] boisterous gift a gift that's going out
[1:05:30] there my gift is to raise your faith
[1:05:32] Amen to such a level where you can
[1:05:34] believe that all things are possible yes
[1:05:37] amen amen hallelujah my gifting is not
[1:05:42] to to handle every situation and then
[1:05:45] you look at me as the man of the hour
[1:05:47] that's not my position my position as
[1:05:50] the pastor of this church is to edify
[1:05:52] the church is to build the church church
[1:05:54] is to feed the church amen until she
[1:05:56] becomes into the statue of Christ until
[1:05:58] amen she becomes in his very own image
[1:06:00] and
[1:06:04] likeness amen praise the Lord
[1:06:07] amen so now we got two different cell
[1:06:11] phones that work
[1:06:14] instantly through prayer amen no
[1:06:18] technician required
[1:06:20] amen no technician
[1:06:23] required Amen in fact it will cost you
[1:06:25] more to go there because when I went

[1:06:30] Thursday I paid to replace the
[1:06:33] screen and I got a fine for 500 for
[1:06:37] parking on the road so it cost me more
[1:06:39] so I need to see my
[1:06:42] attorneys it cost me more to be there so
[1:06:46] I was not prepared that is why I wasn't
[1:06:47] interested the phone I said I had a very
[1:06:49] bad experience I'm not going to take
[1:06:51] this phone back to the guy but you see
[1:06:53] what faith can do and I really was not I
[1:06:57] was not planning to have faith for the
[1:06:58] phone something happened after this was
[1:07:01] like in the late parts of the night I
[1:07:03] think it was going on to 11:00 that
[1:07:05] while I was studying the word I came
[1:07:06] into the kitchen to get water and this
[1:07:08] came over me and I took the
[1:07:11] phone you know how the prophet would say
[1:07:14] like little fish I give you back your
[1:07:15] life he said something just came over
[1:07:17] you it's a supernatural
[1:07:20] thing amen hallelujah amen so we are

[1:08:13] in Genesis 20 Genesis 20 finds Abraham
[1:08:17] and Sarah going Southward again they're
[1:08:20] going and they're going now and they
[1:08:22] find this king of G
[1:08:24] and you know what happens here the king

[1:08:30] you know this the king sees a young
[1:08:32] beautiful Sarah that's
[1:08:34] right but there's an old lie and a old
[1:08:37] seed that's still remaining the old lie
[1:08:40] and the old seed is that this is my
[1:08:45] sister but God is coming to remove all
[1:08:48] of
[1:08:49] it because not after the Angel's message
[1:08:52] can we still continue like like
[1:08:55] this not after he changes Abraham and
[1:08:58] Sarah's body you think he's prepared
[1:09:00] Sarah's body for the king of G to put
[1:09:02] his seed in
[1:09:04] Sarah he wants to take Sarah for
[1:09:07] wife but God stops
[1:09:10] him I'm doing a work I'm changing this
[1:09:13] people not for Satan to come and SW his
[1:09:15] seed into you
[1:09:17] amen God is building you up in faith for
[1:09:20] this hour God is building you up and
[1:09:22] changing you right now amen making you
[1:09:24] produce his life but it's not for Satan
[1:09:26] to come and have his way with you so God
[1:09:28] stops the
[1:09:32] king amen and God wants to destroy the
[1:09:35] entire nation because of
[1:09:37] this but you know ABC goes to say Lord I
[1:09:40] didn't even know it I did this with a
[1:09:41] clear conscience Lord amen the Lord
[1:09:43] tells him you didn't do this with your
[1:09:45] clear conscience I stopped you from
[1:09:47] doing
[1:09:48] this amen that's in verse 6 in 20 verse
[1:09:52] 6 amen the Lord tells him I kept you
[1:09:54] from sinning against me but you restore
[1:09:57] the man's wife back to
[1:09:59] him this church will be restored back to
[1:10:02] a headship this church has been restored
[1:10:05] back to a headship If any man wants to
[1:10:07] mishandle this bride after the Angel's
[1:10:10] message amen God will stop it
[1:10:15] amen amen God has no time amen for this
[1:10:18] bride who has been
[1:10:20] preparing to be manhandled m
[1:10:25] so God stops the king amen and then what
[1:10:30] happens the Lord tells him you go to
[1:10:34] Abraham and he tells him here that
[1:10:37] Abraham is my Prophet it's the first
[1:10:39] time that God calls Abraham his Prophet
[1:10:42] amen

[1:10:48] going and read verse chapter 20 let's
[1:10:50] read the last verse here now you'll be
[1:10:52] thinking hey if Abraham is a prophet can
[1:10:54] he work in signs and wonders and
[1:10:55] miracles and healings let's read there
[1:10:58] amen so you see here the Lord what he
[1:11:00] did here he closed the womb of the of
[1:11:02] the woman
[1:11:04] amen the entire so now what must they do
[1:11:07] verse
