be able to move in that family and they'll be able to surrender amen that's what's required it's a surrender amen so let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 13 going to read amen a bit praise the Lord I'm going to speak this morning on the greatest and most powerful force in Heaven and Earth amen the greatest and most powerful force in Heaven and Earth amen CU that force that was in heaven came down to earth it says here in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity have not love I am becoming I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy Revelation 10:11 and understand all Mysteries Revelation 10:7 and all knowledge and though I have all Faith Mark 11:23 that I can remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing am amen you know what that word nothing means you become unknown I'm talking about the spiritual Kingdom of Jesus Christ you are not known in that Kingdom didn't the ones that come to Jesus say I cast out devils in your name I prophesied in your name Jesus said I never knew you so you become unknown in the Kingdom realm when you don't operate all of these gifts by the driving force which is love so we don't want to be unknown in the kingdom of God we want to be known am Hallelujah and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor that's your Char charitable deeds and though I give my body to be burned that's become a martyr and have not charity it profited me nothing it doesn't add to any bit of my salvation nothing I can do amen charity suffered long is kind charity envieth not charity wanted not itself he's not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope all things endureth all things charity love never faileth but where there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall seize whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things so when I'm adopted I'm going to put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am also known and now abided faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity amen one more portion of scripture in John 13:35 amen John 13:35 says by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another amen let's just pray father we thank you Lord for your precious word we know you are your word Lord in written form oh God you are no different from your word your word is pure your word brings light your word brings illumination oh God your word gives love oh God out of this Bible is Flowing forth the love of Jesus Christ oh God and how we thank you for the Father's Love projected to us oh God we give you glory we give you praise even this morning oh God and we exalt your name oh God Lord above our own thoughts above our own ideas we exalt Your Name Lord Jesus and I pray Lord we'll put aside our own emotions our own Lord selfish nature even now oh God and I pray even as we focus our hearts on your word Lord that Lord your word will find an Abiding Place in our hearts Lord Jesus I pray Lord the word will penetrate our souls oh God and Lord the gene of God will be quickened oh God to Lord add another part oh God lord to our perfection even this morning Lord Jesus I'm praying Lord for deliverance I'm praying for breakthrough I'm praying for miracles I'm praying for healing oh God even as your word is being ministered oh God pray the needs of the people who be met oh God lord we preach the word L God not in letter only but Lord in power and in demonstration oh God so even as the word is being preached I pray Lord the ministering spirits will go across the audience and meet them at the point of need I ask this Blessings Now in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen the Lord bless you may be seated amen we also want to welcome our brother Gabriel amen let's give our brother Gabriel a hand amen praise the Lord amen he's been fellowshipping there with Pastor Denzel amen I believe he's staying in school side at the moment or he's back with his mom so he told me he'll be fellowshipping here amen so we want to welcome you amen and pray amen that the Lord will be able to minister to you and speak to your heart this morning amen hallelujah amen turn to your neighbor and ask him are you ready you ready amen because once we take off there's no stopping amen we're not going to stop for anybody amen so buckle up your seat belts amen we're about to lift off take you into a higher Dimension even this morning amen praise the Lord so we want to say that there is a driving force behind the supernatural amen something that connects the natural to the supernatural to operate the supernatural there must be something Supernatural meaning that we what we are speaking about is not a natural element to produce natural results if we operate in what we are going to speak about this morning we are going to reap Supernatural results so if it's a Supernatural is not from the earth it's a supernatural force and when the supernatural Force collides with the Earth and and and and and connects with a man that's operating in [Music] faith then the man of the earth no longer operates in the natural sphere the natural realm is operating in a supernatural realm amen the Bible says in Romans chapter 8:14 that Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God Amen can I see the hands of Sons and Daughters of God Sons and Daughters of God are LED by the spirit of God what is that Spirit it is the Holy Ghost so we are being led by the Holy Ghost we are being governed by the Holy Ghost and the highest dimension of the Holy Ghost is what we are striving for in this time in this season amen we have been building from from a fith dimension a dimension of the Holy Ghost but we have been building an adding to our faith we've been adding virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness amen and and moving on now to charity which is love the highest Dimension now when we reach this stage or this level of our walk we are no longer operating in the realm of the five senses of the flesh or by natural laws now how many of you know that seven is God's number amen God doesn't stop at six amen amen seven is God's number so I'm asking you if we operate by five senses and the six sens is Faith what is the seven sense because you can't stop God at the six sense there's a sense and that not force behind the supernatural something that is producing faith in the hearts of the children of God in this hour amen remember what we are saying now we have all the seals we have all the Mysteries we have all of these things but they got to be a supernatural Force Amen to operate all of these Mysteries that we know praise the Lord so there is a seven sense that we want to attain and unlock to the believer amen praise the Lord now we in that season of aai 60 where sons and daughters have Arisen we have awaken from sleep we have heard the bridegroom's call at midnight going out to meet him amen we our light is shining and the glory of the Lord is risen upon us amen we are operating under Psalm 24 where we are ascending the hill of the Lord with Clean Hands and a pure heart amen put up Zechariah 4:7 there you'll see amen that the Capstone of Love is coming down with shoutings of Grace Grace yes Hallelujah now we know that in the Old Testament it was God above us in the New Testament amen it was God with us but God Amen now God wants to be in US yes amen God is not satisfied being up above us God is not satisfied being with us God wants to be in us that's why he sent the Holy Ghost amen he's descending like a dove amen God does not want amen you Amen to leave him outside of your internal beings God doesn't want the Holy Ghost on your flesh God doesn't want the holy ghost in your spirit but God wants the Holy Ghost to Quicken that Jean seed in your soul amen if it's only Quicken In the Flesh and spirit will be plain church that's the realm that God the prophet of God says that you can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost 24/7 and still go to hell how in the Realms of the Flesh and the Realms of the spirit but when the Holy Ghost quickens that c Gene that representation that came from God Amen you are no longer a son and daughter of the earth then you are no longer a son and daughter of your father and mother but you're a son and daughter of the Living God praise the Lord amen now there are two powerful forces on the Earth today both working for the soul of men the Earth amen is the Lords and the fullness thereof we know that's in scripture the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof and although it belongs to him he has put the Earth under the control of man Genesis amen 1 let them have dominion amen God has given the Earth Amen to man to have dominion praise the Lord hallelujah he gave man dominion over the Earth so God won't violate his own word God won't do anything on the earth unless he gets amen a man to cooperate with his plan praise the Lord because man on the Earth has the legal Authority praise the Lord God is always working with man he walked with Enoch he walked with Noah he walked with Abraham he walked with Moses he walked with Joshua he walked with the seven judges of Israel he worked with the Kings he worked with the prophets he worked with Paul irenius columus Martin amen Martin Luther Wesley he worked with William brandham and in this day he's working with sons and daughters of God the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ God is always working with men amen praise the Lord amen and this bride has a peculiar quality she possesses something that none of the others possessed what she possesses is title deed back in a hand again Revelation 10 brought down the title deed back to the Bride of Jesus Christ on the earth something that the others never have so what Adam lost the bride is not got what a special class of people we are amen I think we ought to give the Lord a good anim of praise for that amen that the Lord has given us back title deed praise the Lord amen amen now the prophet of God is going to tell us some secret now we we we know that the prophet of God was accused by and and not just accused but he was told by the angel of God you explain the gift too much you gave away too much because of his compassion and his heart for the people amen but he's going to give us Secrets amen praise the Lord in that in that quote there now it says but let tell you a little secret the most powerful force in the world isn't speaking with tongues or interpreting tongues or being honored by God to be a minister to be an evangelist or to be a prophet the most powerful weapon that I've ever found in my life is love amen I I want to make a statement that I think some that that maybe majority of us have not been operating out of this Force we've trying to be operate with faith can we get honest people we've been trying to operate with faith not realizing the secret praise the Lord remember there faith hope and charity but the greatest is what the prophet is saying the secret hallelujah amen the most powerful weapon most powerful force on the earth I found in my life is love now he says there's filo love there's there's types of love this F of love which is the Greek word comes from Friendship like you have for your wife there's a difference it's it'll make a mother for that baby run into a blazing fire a life means nothing that's filal what will agape love do The Godly love now you know the prophet of God I'm going to go through the story very quickly the prophet of God is talking about these two girls who are coming home from college and they were riding the train and the mother was waiting there at the train station to greet her daughter so when the the mother saw the daughter coming from the train she was so excited and she say my darling how are you and these two girls amen before they got up there looking at each other and the one friend told this girl who's that ugly looking woman there and she was so embarrassed of her mother amen because the mother was like burned on her face had scars on her face amen and there was a conductor standing and listening to this conversation and she told her friend I don't know who that woman is hallelujah and the conductor stopped her and she said aren't you ashamed of yourself yes we know the story of your mother when you were a child you were trapped in a burning building and your mother was a beautiful young woman but the love in her heart for you she didn't want to leave you in that burning building the firefighters tried to stop her and tell her you can't go into the house but the love of the mother ran into a burning building to save her daughter and says now you stand here and you embarrassed and ashamed of your mother now if the love of a mother will make her run into a burning building the love of a s a father God Amen sent down his son to the Earth because his sons and daughters were lost if I can say it this way hell was on the earth and God sent his son into hell on the earth to rescue his sons and daughters amen yes Lord thank you praise the Lord John 3:16 God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever should believe on him should not perish but have everlasting life amen praise the Lord the prophet of God says we must love divinely love one another then you don't see your brother's mistake what's the first thing we see when we see somebody taken up in a fault we tell somebody we want to talk about it he says but you must love one another then you don't see your brother's so what I'm saying if you've always been seeing your brother's mistakes you will not not operating in love because he says love don't make you see your brother's mistake amen amen why am I reading it wrong he says then you don't see your brother's mistake if he does make a mistake you never you look over the top of it and you love him anyhow praise the Lord that's it love those that love you then does not the sinner do the same thing but love those who doesn't love you amen amen praise the Lord that's what the spirit of God is in you cuz he loved you when you were his enemy and he loved you and that Spirits in you it'll make you love your enemy as you do your friend he says whether your neighbor treats you right or not you love him anyhow that's right whether he agrees with you or not you love him anyhow that's the way you got to do it that's the hidden life that's the consecrated life that's the life that veils of the worlds and you're shut off from the things of the world you only live in Christ you see what I mean church amen so if we want to learn how to operate in the super anointing that the prophet talks about amen how do we get this agape love God knows there's nothing we can do on our own to generate this kind of a love we can't manufacture this kind of a love so he sent something to equip us with this kind of a love and it's the one thing that people don't want it's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost puts the love of God in our hearts Galatians 5:22 says that the fruit of the spirit is love amen praise the Lord so we have human love fully of love this love is found in all humans be it Christian or non-christians you find good people who love amen when you look at them you can admire them the way they love for Humanity The Love For Animals the love for nature amen they have a natural love but the love we're talking about supersedes this kind of a love yes amen amen we are talking about the essence of God God is love so how do we get the kind of love we know that Divine love is an attribute of the Holy Ghost we can Love Like Jesus loved when we get the Holy Ghost we can heal like Jesus healed when we get the Holy Ghost we can deliver like Jesus delivered when we get the Holy Ghost because the same spirit that was in Jesus is in the body of Christ amen no wonder the book of Acts could operate like like that they were filled with the Holy Ghost they were no different to Jesus thank they operated with the same power with the same anointing amen amen so much so the religious world was rocked amen they didn't know how to handle them so they had to kill them like they killed Jesus it's the only way they could stop it but the move of God is Unstoppable amen you kill this body of Flesh the Holy Ghost will raise up another son and daughter of God Amen to equip the church amen praise the Lord so amen I also am saying that this elements and this Dimension can remain untapped we can come to church we can enjoy the mysteries of God but there are dimensions of the Holy Ghost that we can leave untapped the prophet of God would talk about untapped resources if you want to search it up search up untapped resources there are resources available to the body of Christ but they are not touched people don't want to delve into those Realms people don't have faith enough to move up into those Realms why they are satisfied with just certain portions of the word but the body of Jesus Christ The Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ as the full opening of the word and she operates in all dimensions of the Holy Ghost amen thank you Lord praise the Lord so we don't want to leave things untapped we don't want to have untapped resources amen if we choose not to utilize all that the father has unlocked to us in this adoption season when you come to adoption there's an expectation for you to handle the father's business that is why he adopts you he gives you the robe he gives you the ring he gives you the Seal of authority that all that you fire is fired and all that you hire is hired whatever you bind on Earth is bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth is loosed in heaven father has a responsibility for Sons and Daughters of God and Sons and Daughters of God have got to step up to this responsibility father doesn't bring us to adoption for us to to wander and live an endless life and not be involved in this Kingdom realm praise the Lord so in the season of adoption when the adoption season is here it takes the ability amen it takes the ability of Sons and Daughters of God Amen we've got to take responsibility and start to exercise our rights and our responsibilities in our father's Kingdom and like we were teaching Amen on the on the Wednesday your identity unlocks your Authority if you don't know who you are you can never operate in your Authority so that's why God came to take away Amnesia with the opening of the the word to reveal our true identity so that we can operate in our Authority amen praise the Lord amen so we cannot live our lives using human fil your love that won't work amen love in the kingdom of God that is amen we know that he fighting amen the kingdom of Satan I'm saying that again that love in the kingdom of God is fighting the kingdom of Satan not works not our own good Deeds love is what the Conquering force is praise the Lord so we must tap into Divine laws in this season praise the lord we must tap into Divine principles if we want to see Divine results if we want to experience a supernatural we can't remain Earthbound In the Flesh you know what the definition is of insanity is tell us brother amen we doing the same things over and over again expecting a different result but we're not getting a different result so the prophet of God says if you want you got to tap into untapped resources if you want a different result amen we've got to work with spiritual laws to encounter the supernatural prophet of God now goes back amen we're going back to to the quote now and love is the most powerful force that there is in the world and if you notice a devil is always hate so if we have hate in our hearts that's of the devil we need to get rid of it amen we can't hate anybody yes amen amen hate is of the devil and when people hate someone remember it is a terrible devil to despise or dislike you you mustn't do that tell your neighbor you mustn't do that no hate praise the Lord and you never cast a devil out by a wrong attitude so we're learning something else now attitude PS a plays an important role in operating the Supernatural and in Deliverance Ministry because you can't cast out a demon with a wrong attitude right what he says it takes what to do that Faith what is he saying it takes love to do that love that moved a mighty God God who love the world that he gave his only begotten son he says love is a great keynote thing we leave out it's something that's Eternal so it's from another realm it's from that seven Dimension amen it's it's the most powerful force that stops anything there is is love so I'm saying whatever situation you're going through love can be that foret stops IT praise the Lord now remember it takes our attitude we can choose to respond to that situation out of the human element or we can allow this great love Spirit to overtake us and then from that Dimension now we operate I am not going to allow that negativity to affect me yes or your actions now to change my entire atmosphere you see when when we start to operate like this we live in a world unto ourselves we live in a world that nobody knew about I'm quoting now perfect Faith Jesus lived in a world that nobody knew he was so in control of his emotions so in control amen because why St John 5:19 the son can do nothing but what he sees the father do that doth the son likewise amen the prophet says love God love God's love is the most powerful thing that there is in the world it conquers anything love conquers backbiting love conquers jealousy love conquers Petty differences love conquers our differences in Doctrine love conquers all things we had one Prophet with one message but different interpretations of that message has caused divisions amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ and the most powerful force was left out to solve that problem had we used love we could have settled our differences Hallelujah you won't be playing with the elephants here or you won't be playing with the elephant's trunk whoever gave that analogy must have been an ant have you ever went to Wildlife and you never knew what you were looking at and you saw the elephant how many of you went on a wildlife Drive come on now how many of you that elephant was so big you never knew what you were looking at you see how foolish we are in our analogies you always know what you're looking at so how come that analogy is oh I am playing with the ear I'm playing with the tail I'm playing with the nose with the trunk amen you can see the picture clearly now you know what you're looking at stop playing with a trunk praise the Lord now I want to the prophet here is breaking this down I want to read it slowly love is the most powerful thing that there is in the world it conquers Anything Is Love by this you shall conquer by Divine love loving one another number one loving the cause of God Number Two Loving Christ number three loving suffering Humanity number four he says that's how you conquer so you got to have a love for God you got to have love for one another amen you got to have a love for the cause of God you got to love suffering human it how else are we going to sigh and cry for the Abominations in the city if we don't love them you know you can't cry and sigh because of of frustration you can't sign and cry for the Abominations done in the city because you are frustrated with the evils that are going on no you've got to operate by this powerful force because you love you are sighing and you are crying love for Humanity that they are going to perish no amens on that amen hallelujah he says that's how you conquer yes Matthew 5:44 to 46 here what the Lord Jesus says but I say unto you love your enemies this is our Lord Jesus Christ teaching us how to operate like Adam love your enemies bless them that curse you who they're calling your names they cursing you so now you can't say you're lucky I'm not that old man hey now you can't say love where's my bush knife you can't say let Bush knifes for Bob your eyes what you got to do now how many of us have practically done this you've blessed someone who was swearing at you and cursing you but that's what Jesus is saying he's saying love your enemies bless them that curse you now I must stop there and tell you don't love the devil some of you will think hey the pastor gave me license now I can love the devil you must not love the devil bless them that curse you now I'm speaking these things so we can start to apply it practically so the next time as soon as you leave this door somebody comes to curse you and revile against you and say all manner of things against you you're going to bless them if you don't know how to bless them this is how you bless them God bless you yes do good to them that do good to you do good to them that give you gifts now Jesus is saying people that hate you you must do good to them which means you're going to have to go out of your way to do good to them which means that that cake you wanted to buy for your sister because you love your sister you must now buy the cake for that one who hates you but I thought we want to be like Jesus amen to be like Jesus all I can hear is the fan no amens praise the Lord what is he saying do good how many of us have done good to people who hate us amen but I'm talking about a practical gospel now if you want to operate in this love Dimension you start to do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you which means you know now they're using you but you're going to pray for them while they using you while they using you you're going to be praying for them and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven you see what he's saying for you to become an adopted son of God and reflect his character and nature you have to do these things for he maketh the San to rise on the evil and on the good and send it rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same tell your neighbor I just love that what Jesus said tell him I'm going to practice that some of you are not saying it because you're not going to come on I'm going to practice this now I'm going to love them that hate me I'm going to do good to them that hate me I'm going to bless them that curs me yes amen now Jesus won't say something if he himself won't manifest it if you look at Luke 23:34 there Jesus on the cross beaten bruised nailed others these words then Jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do so if a baton bruised uh nailed Jesus on the cross can still forgive people how about us amen yes amen the Propet of God again the mightiest Force there is on the earth is love there's nothing that will break down love Hallelujah there is nothing that will break down love so marriages can't break down if it's built on love am there is nothing that can break down love so friendships can't be broken down because of love so homes can't be torn apart because nothing can break down love amen hallelujah no matter what it is see the prophet is saying no matter what it is nothing can break down if you're operating by love yes amen relationships can't be broken sir if you're operating by love amen which means you can't say from this day ends Let It Be written let it be known from this day ends let the name of this person be stricken from every book I'm quoting Moses now if you ever saw Ten Commandments Pharaoh let the name of Moses be stricken from every book so we can't be writing people off is what I am saying amen yes you can't be telling them from this day on I got no more sister from this day forward I'm an orphan Love Will Conquer everything amen you see these are the mental battles people face nobody loves me you keep saying that nobody will love you because you're confessing that Hallelujah nothing good ever happens to me well you live by your confession that's right Jesus said you have no not because you ask not it works in the other way as well what you're asking that's how you're living praise the Lord amen amen nothing can break down love no matter what it is but until love anchors in your heart you're still out of God that's right you have you've got to have love the Bible says God is love the love is the strongest force if you want to be a real outstanding person in the church I if you you want to be an outstanding person in the church wherever whereever Church you go to just fall in love with God with all your heart and when you do that you will fall in love with every member of your church and every member of everybody else's church with your all your heart see not only fall in love with your church the prophet is said saying fall in love with everyone else's members too I know other people love our members praise the Lord thank Lord you can't Bluff that now there's something about it that people know if there's anything I can contribute to the success of my meeting Earthly speaking is to know that people have a conscience that I truly love people now watch this is going to help the ministry now people must be able to see that you love them that you care for them that you're concerned about them otherwise we shouldn't be preaching we don't have that love for them the love is trying to bring them up to a level so that they can operate as Sons and Daughters of God Amen he says I just love people and they know that and you can't fool them on that here in another quote blind BTO ma he says you know why I can help you it's because you love me and you believe me I'm trying to bring Clarity to the angel speaking to the prophet if you get the people to believe you but the driving force behind the believing was what love his love for the people and the people's love for so can you see that the angel telling the prophet if you get the people to believe you there was a driving force behind that the prophet is giving it away here you know why I can help you is because you love me and you believe me see if you didn't believe me no matter what kind of works God would do by me you still wouldn't get any benefit do you know that that's my success with the Lord the people love me and I love them praise the Lord and that's where the success comes from love will do it he says I've been a great lover of Wildlife and I've noticed in animal life if you love animals if you love them you can do anything with them you want to and if you don't love them they know it if you're afraid of them like a biting dog if somebody said the dog will bite and if you afraid of him you're going to get a bit you're going to get bit now you're not going to fool him you might say I'm not afraid of him that better come from somewhere beside your lips cuz he knows better if you're not afraid of him it's different divine love is the most powerful forces it's the greatest force in the world and when Divine love has been projected and comes to its end then Sovereign Grace will take its place watch now there's a there's a there's a process happening here he says when Divine love is being projected he says Sovereign Grace now will come in on the scene and what will it do it will project Sovereign Grace will take its place he says give me a consecrated life that's dead rose again in Jesus Christ who lives in the Shak of Glory with the love of God around them that's the person I believe is going to be there put me beneath the veil under the blood of the Lord take all your gifts you have in the scripture the devil can impersonate every one of them oh yes right but he can't impersonate love amen so love when anyone loves you you know that can't be of of the devil when you're operating in Divine love you know that can't be of the devil because the devil will never impersonate love yes amen it's too pure amen it's the seven sense it's something he knows nothing about amen yes yes is that the secret beneath the seal that he knows nothing about yes and it don't matter that he hears me even saying it now because he can't impersonate love yes amen thank you Lord yes praise the Lord he can't impersonate love cuz love is genuine the devil can't love that's one thing he can't do and when you are to a place that you love one another and all the world is dead if you love God he says how many love him with real Divine Love Now how do you do that here's one witness because you have L one for another so he says the first sign is you love one another then you're starting to operate in Divine love now that's right we know we have passed from Death unto life when we love our Brethren he says love conquers it's just the most conquering Force there is because it's of God Amen we got to go quickly now amen because we are going to close praise the Lord he says I looked back at so here the prophet is talking about that bull now and he says I looked back at the fence it was too far to run no tree to get to it and there I was standing there and here he come he says something happened he's trying to show you now something came over him something happened I wish that would happen all the time right he just don't do it but when I see a tremendous sick case and something happens it's not man it's when God can get a hold of man it's when it's consecrated so man operating out of divine love is a different kind of a man amen amen that's why the prophet could walk into a hospital room and people will be discharged he's operating from a different realm and and I see the church tapping into those things praise the Lord watch on the platform when the Visions happen when evil spirits moving up watch takes place it's what brother Bram is given the secret but nobody wants it it's what surrender hey we're not reading this together what's happening here it's what it's a surrender it's a surrender to the Holy Spirit he comes in and takes over so when you are saying Supernatural taking place you know that man of God is Anointed by the Holy Ghost the devil can't cast out Devils Kingdom of Satan is not divided against itself when you are seeing people being healed delivered restored set free amen that's the power of the Holy Ghost operating through Sons and Daughters of God now why am I telling you this we've got to start to recognize the power of God back in the church amen amen we've got to start to confidence in one another we've got to start to have love one for another to understand that this man this son of daughter of God is operating by the Holy Ghost this is a holy ghost fill son and daughter of God I'm not dealing with a natural person so I can't treat them with content I can't treat them from a natural emotion praise the Lord amen he says he comes in and takes over watch how he controls it just watch how it takes place it's God it's not man am and if we only live in that God let us live there amen amen thank you Lord and as that bull standing 20 yards from me Rose and here you come great long ons this is the end and instead of hating that bull it seemed strange I loved him amen I loved him I wish I could explain it but let me tell you something brother you'll never come in contact with a greater force in this life than love amen yes sir I do not try to conquer Demons by kicking him hello I do not try to conquer Demons by kicking them I love God oh I hope we getting these Keys amen we can only present keys to the church it's up to you to take keys to unlock thank you Lord thank you yes what he does I love God Amen see love is what God is God is love love moves God so God so Lov the world love is what conquers Devils amen love is what conquers sicknesses love is what conquers Affliction love is what conquers your lack he says I was no more afraid of that bull then I would be of my brother sitting there with the Bible on his lap that's it he says people today is afraid what are you afraid of even death itself don't scare a Christian yes amenallah amen the blood of Jesus Took the power of sin away amen saying that again the blood of Jesus Took the power that sin had over your away so sin becomes powerless before you amen amen the blood of Jesus and the sacrifice of the the Lamb on the cross even took the power that death had over us death has no power over us but death becomes a doorway that releases us into our new body come on I need you to say Amen to that amen death is no power over us therefore we Are Not Afraid over death amen people are afraid what are you afraid of even death itself don't scare a Christian he says the very thoughts of people he scared the doctor told me I just can't get well your father told you you'll never amount to nothing your teacher said you're good for nothing amen what are you scared of there is an atonement laying for you Yonder amen I've done so much sin what are you scared of there's an atonement waiting for you amen I don't want to hear anybody telling me that they are sinner if you've been born again and filled with the Holy Ghost the blood of Jesus Christ is taking care of your sin yes you can't strengthen sin again by glorifying it right right you need to start to confess I'm a sinless spotless wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we need to see ourselves the way God sees us amen it says then there's someone who loves you don't be scared the constant words of Jesus fear not he that was dead and is alive again alive forever more fear not get that atmosphere around you where you are not afraid now he says this takes an atmosphere get the atmosphere he says You must come with that kind of an attitude have the real thing first it will produce the rest of it if we have the real thing first it'll produce the rest of of it thank you Lord I'm going to dramatize this but the quote is there you can put it up amen the prophet of God is mowing his lawn amen and he was covered with Hornets he was there he took his shirt off and he was mowing the lawn he says he he hit the Hornet's Nest and the Hornets were all over his body right he says I was covered all over with hits don't never hate love so when you are covered with negative of words you are covered amen oppression you are covered with depression and people are coming against you you are covered with it don't ever ate love love is what conquers instead of hating those Hornets I loved the little fellows that sounds juvenile but it's true amen and I said little creatures of God I'm sorry I Disturbed you this is your home I know the sisters don't want to talk to the Cor approaches like that now I am sorry I Disturbed you this is your home but I'm a servant of God and praying for sick children and many are waiting I haven't time to play with you run on up to your nest right quick in Jesus name and leave me alone I won't bother you no more and God my eternal judge knows that they formed a circle and went straight back to their nest amen love Hallelujah atmosphere the atmosphere there's something about it now do you realize being a son and daughter of God that you're a minor Creator do you know that you can create the atmosphere that you live in do you realize that the atmosphere that you dwell in you influence somebody else what makes people act the way they do is because what makes the drunks like to be with drunks as my mother used to say in old proverb and I think it's sou too birds of a feather flock together because they have things in common so that's why we love gathering with children of God we have things in common amen God moves in nature love conquers everything and when love is projected Grace comes in to help it am now watch it's going to bring another element when we start to pro project the Divine love Grace is going to come in then it's real conquering love he says when Divine love led by the Holy Ghost is projected think of it the love of God and the grace of God brought an airplane out of the Skies talking about Ana now and set it on the ground held it there because of an ignorant colored woman prayer in faith you all know that story a son was dying with this veneral disease she prayed and she said Lord I'm your shite woman where is your Elijah God honored the faith of that woman he caused a storm that plane had to be grounded because the prophet was on the plane and while he was there posting letters the holy spirit amen because there was a delay now in the flight until it got again and he was going to post a letter and the Holy Spirit told him go down this way and he was directing him and he came right in front of this gate of this woman and the woman said good morning person he says it was love that caught you see what what what what is the prophet saying here the love of God and the grace of God brought a plane out of the Skies set it on the ground held it there because an ignorant colored woman's prayer in faith than you Lord amen amen you see and her love for a little boy if it'll do that for that what will it do to a born again group of people who sitting together like we are here Love Will Conquer anything don't practice so much of whether your gifts or not but practice that one real gift of love then you'd be better love conquers all thing love the Lord with all your heart all your soul all your mind with all your strength and faith will accompany that love right he's talking about now the man that was going to come and crush crush him on the stage there and hit him he said and he made a great big threat and before I could say anything the Holy Spirit began to speak and instead of hating the man I loved him and the love of God was projected to him and he rolled around his big eyes like that fell on my feet in the floor love conquered amen let's skip the next one and go to the one where he says God gave the holy spirit amen he says brother God gave the Holy Spirit God's love to control the church amen the Holy Spirit not smart educated but love gift goes in the church but he don't control the church love controls the church he quotes John 3:16 his love constrained him to do it right I'm driving a point here now because this is what I want to get to when a love is constrained then Sovereign Grace projects its object may I say that that again when Divine love is projected Grace produces its object am yes indeed when you love God so much Sovereign Grace will project you the baptism of the Holy Ghost to make you live love and be a real Christian so I'm saying when when Divine love is projected over the sick Sovereign Grace will produce healing now let's understand it really now if you want to see the Supernatural in another way when we are praying for the sick he says Divine love must be projected so that Sovereign Grace will produce healing is everybody understanding the quote what about when Divine love is projected over those that are bound those that are captive Sovereign Grace will produce Deliverance chains will be broken amen how about when when Divine love is projected over the broken hearted Grace will project the bomb to heal that broken heartall what about when when Divine love is projected over a disagreement and argument broken relationships Grace will produce reconciliation amen Grace will produce forgiveness amen what we talking about the Divine now can we see the key element here is divine love what about when Divine love is projected over your lack when Divine love is projected over amen your shortcomings amen maybe Divine love is projected over your finances Sovereign Grace will project will produce abundance come on now somebody's not getting this I said when when when Divine love is projected over your lack over your shortcomings over your finances or maybe the lack of finances Sovereign Grace will produce Gyra Sovereign Grace will produce abundance because that's how the kingdom is a kingdom of life is an abundant life is a fruitful life amen gyro will step in and produce the Overflow in that time of lack yes amen praise the Lord want to drive this point one more time to show you the prophet is not playing when he's teaching this he says I don't know why but something happened always when a healing takes place or anything there something happens I'm trying to show this Prophet was not operating by faith alone he was operating out of love which produces Faith a love comes in and it just takes everything else out the way you see when they say now what a mighty prophet of God this was he was operating in faith the bride says yes yes but there was a power behind it there was a force behind it and this is what Ben him won't know about this is what not wasin bolt what's this other guy's name Uber Angel you want talk about this key Uber Angel these men who study the prophet's life and Ministry you'll hear them talk about his Faith but the bride is talking about the substance that produced that Faith hallelujah amen yes thank you amen he says now look we know he was the mightiest Prophet we know he's operating in Realms of healing that was unseen to this world even now they are baffled by it yeah what he saying I'm going to read it again he says I don't know why but something always when a healing takes place or anything there's something happens a love comes in and it just takes everything else out the way and I tell you Brethren you can have all the theology you have but give me love every time you can have all the seals you want seals standers V trumpet but give me love amen a I tell you we got to fight we've got the most powerful weapon the devil makes fun of it and says there's no such a thing you see why he says there's no such a thing he can't impersonate it right but pick up tonight and receive the Holy Ghost and defeat every devil of sin drunkenness whatever it is we got him on the run to be conquered you see right now the devil hates what I'm teaching you I'm teaching you the Conquering Force yes Lord thank you the devil maybe even rejoicing when we trying to build your faith but now we teaching you the driving force Bey the faith amen amen and brother this is God's word which is sharper than a two-edged sword it's the greatest power that is ever put in the hands of man and God's expecting I'm closing now right God is expecting Adam's race is anyone here part of Adam's race to put sin sickness and all kinds of devil to the fighting walls that's right we've got the most powerful weapon there is Arnold F vinkle ra left them sticks and stones but God left us his word and his Spirit let's stand for Christ let's stand for the word let's pull the sword out of the sheep and fight amen he says this is my last quote now Brethren we've draw little Circles of laws and different things and we've still never come to the real kernel oh this mystery this mystery this mystery we never came to the colonel it's Jesus Christ the love of God hallelujah didn't he say what was him seals about didn't he say it was Christ it was revealing Christ it's Jesus Christ the love of God that God wants us to see what a Pity love is the greatest most powerful weapon that this world has ever seen or know of it's a Dying For Love yes the church is perishing for love the real love of God Waters of Grace to flow one to another when confidence is restored when Justice is restored between us the love of God that's shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit God's love to us so with that I'm going to close and say this is the secret behind coming back to all that Adam lost faith operating through love yes you must speak to mountains but there's a driving force behind your faith it's the greatest of three and now remember what we've been saying all this time not it's not three it's one the essence of love Faith open love is the essence of love it's all one so you are a power Pat Supernatural Force thank you that The Fifth Dimension can't deal with Satan and his armies can't deal with you you become an invincible Army you see all this time people thought they're going to be an invincible Army by the knowledge of the word wow amen yes I'm going to say this again in in a very short statement the opening of the word came to take away our Amnesia so that we can recognize we are Sons and Daughters of God and what we lost right then the book was brought back to Sons and Daughters of God to now make us start to operate like how Adam was operating and how do we know how ad Adam was operating because the Bible is silent about those things the Bible don't tell you how Adam was operating it's the prophet who told us how Adam operated but how do we know how Adam operated when we look at the last Adam yes when we see how Jesus Christ was operating we know that's exactly how Adam operated let's stand together give God praise amen the driving force behind the Church of the Living amen Divine love coming to the church even now amen I say God is amen I say God is releasing his AAP love upon his bride even now yes he wants to unlock the driving force behind your faith amen glory be to his name amen we're going to sing and worship Him Praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen amen Amen Let the Praises of God ring out amen start to say thank you Jesus start to say praise the Lord oh he's worthy to be praised oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory be to his name amen amen amen amen oh what a lovely father we have amen praise the name of Jesus praise the name of Jesus amen amen let's sing I just want to speak the name of Jesus how many of you want to speak his name amen praise the Lord
