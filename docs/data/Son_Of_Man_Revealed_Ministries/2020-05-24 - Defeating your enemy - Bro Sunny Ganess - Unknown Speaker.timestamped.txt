[27:22] you could listen at the comfort of your
[27:24] home and I pray you just give us give
[27:28] the Holy Ghost your undivided attention
[27:30] and let God speak to you this morning
[27:33] sometimes we become too lethargic
[27:36] sometimes we become too complacent and
[27:39] the time has come when we look around
[27:41] the world we can find that the coming of
[27:44] the Lord is so soon all these things are
[27:46] pointed that pointing out to one thing
[27:48] is the return of the Lord the Bible says
[27:51] when you see begin to see these things
[27:52] begin to happen say lift up your head
[27:54] for your Redemption
[27:55] draw nigh and this morning we realize
[27:58] how close we are to that coming but only
[28:00] thing that we have this morning is the
[28:02] Word of God the Word of God is
[28:05] established in your heart you know that
[28:07] you have a conquering you have a
[28:09] conquering power and this morning
[28:11] conquering power is only in the Word of
[28:13] God because the Bible says the Word of
[28:14] God is just the two-edged sword and it
[28:17] says it cuts both ways it cuts the
[28:19] preach and it cuts the people so this
[28:21] morning I want you to know one of these
[28:23] being said now is being said not only to
[28:25] you out there but it is also to the
[28:27] preacher this morning and now I just
[28:29] pray this morning that God will give you
[28:31] the grace that you will continue
[28:33] continue to serve him better every day
[28:35] even in these times of trials and the
[28:37] tribulations that we have I want to tell
[28:39] you this morning the only thing that we
[28:41] have and the greatest the greatest armor
[28:44] that we have this morning is prayer this
[28:46] morning and I pray that God will bless
[28:48] you we go straight into the word because
[28:50] of time constraint I'm not in
[28:53] international peace I just feel so
[28:54] nervous preaching in this through this
[28:58] medium of of service I just feel so
[29:04] inadequate but I just pray that the Lord
[29:07] will make a way lead us through this day
[29:09] and I pray that the Lord will give you
[29:11] grace while you listen we're going to
[29:14] turn to God's precious word this morning
[29:15] and I thank God you know sometimes God
[29:17] work in such a mysterious way and pastor
[29:19] Ronnie preached and that's that
[29:20] scripture that I'm going to read this
[29:22] morning and you know when the prayer
[29:24] well thought I was so so glad in my
[29:28] heart to know that the Holy Ghost is in
[29:30] our presence we've got a chance to look
[29:32] God's precious word second Thessalonians
[29:36] chapter 2
[29:43] and we're gonna turn to Romans 8 2nd
[29:48] Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 1 now I
[29:59] beseech you brethren by the coming of
[30:01] our Lord Jesus Christ and by our
[30:04] gathering together unto him that ye be
[30:08] not soon shaken in the mind or be
[30:12] troubled later
[30:15] the spirit nor by word nor by letter as
[30:19] from us as that the day of Christ is at
[30:23] hand let no man deceive you by any means
[30:27] for that
[30:29] Dasia shall not come she'll not come
[30:32] except there be they become a falling
[30:35] away first and that man of sin be
[30:38] revealed the son of perdition we can
[30:42] find this morning that this falling away
[30:46] is prevalent in our society in our our
[30:51] churches we find people come people go
[30:54] and some people have been here for
[30:57] thirty years some people have been here
[30:58] for 40 years but without a revelation
[31:01] you cannot serve God without a
[31:04] revelation of this message you are
[31:06] wasting your time and you better not
[31:08] waste more time you better go because
[31:12] God doesn't want this you can be very it
[31:16] can be a very very disappointed person
[31:18] when the rapture take place you can be a
[31:20] very disappointed person so if you don't
[31:24] have a revelation of this message don't
[31:26] waste your time in this message because
[31:28] this message is calling out a bride a
[31:30] bride without spot and without wrinkle
[31:33] this morning as we continue we will see
[31:36] that what God has in plan for you who
[31:41] opposed it and absorbed himself above
[31:43] all that is called God isn't that
[31:47] happening today or that is worshipped so
[31:51] that so that he has God sitteth in a
[31:54] temple in the temple of God showing
[31:57] himself that he is gone who else can do
[32:00] that today we find the people I don't
[32:03] know whether they have already met the
[32:05] ministers of all denominations the big
[32:08] boys of the of the churches they all
[32:11] have gathered and they've all have gone
[32:13] to meet the Pope I don't know if they've
[32:15] done it already or they still going to
[32:16] do it but this the Prophet said we might
[32:19] be thankful this morning that we had
[32:21] somebody come on on our way somebody
[32:25] came and met us on our way and showed us
[32:28] where this is all about and what it is
[32:30] all about what is going to happen and we
[32:32] are so glad this morning that we will
[32:34] not be deceived praise the Lord
[32:36] amen you happy that's why praise the
[32:40] Lord
[32:43] remember me not that when I was yet with
[32:47] you I told you these things and now you
[32:51] know that we told it that he might be
[32:56] revealed in the hinnies time for the
[33:00] mystery of iniquity that already work
[33:03] only he who now letteth will let until
[33:08] he and he be taken out of the way and
[33:14] then shall that wicked be revealed whom
[33:19] the Lord shall consume with the spirit
[33:23] of his mouth and shall destroy with the
[33:27] brightness of his coming even him whose
[33:30] coming is after the working of Satan
[33:32] with all power and signs and lying
[33:36] wonders and with all deceivableness of
[33:40] all unrighteousness in death in them
[33:44] that perish because they received not
[33:47] the love of the truth that they might be
[33:50] saved what is the love of the truth we
[33:53] consign find all these things are taking
[33:56] place in our in the presence of us those
[33:59] of you those people that are reading
[34:01] this message know these things are
[34:03] taking place
[34:04] and if you are not reading the messages
[34:07] you are not going to find out the truth
[34:09] and yeah it says that you will it says
[34:13] clearly that they have not received the
[34:17] truth and because they did not receive
[34:19] the truth that is why they are in that
[34:21] condition praise the Lord
[34:25] shall we go to Romans 8 Romans 8:35
[34:39] praise the Lord who shall separate us
[34:44] from the love of Christ shall
[34:47] tribulation or distress or persecution
[34:50] or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
[34:56] as it is written for thy sake we are
[35:01] killed all the day long how we literally
[35:05] kill we are not literally killed but in
[35:09] our spirits we are killed all day long
[35:13] because we cannot see what is taking
[35:16] place our eyes cannot behold what takes
[35:18] place in our daily life sometimes we
[35:21] have to pass these things and pretend
[35:25] that we do not see them foot
[35:32] [Music]
[35:35] we are accounted as sheep for the
[35:38] slaughter nay in all these things we are
[35:43] more than conquerors through him that
[35:46] loved us for I am persuaded that neither
[35:50] death neither death nor life nor angels
[35:55] no no principalities nor powers for
[35:59] things that present not not things
[36:02] present nor things to come nor height
[36:05] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[36:08] be able to separate us from the love of
[36:12] God which is in Jesus Christ may be
[36:16] seated
[36:18] praise the Lord glory to God glory to
[36:22] God this morning my subject I would like
[36:28] to treat this morning as a subject is
[36:32] defeating your enemy now we find this
[36:39] enemy was defeated in heaven he was
[36:43] defeated in heaven because he had a name
[36:48] which was called Lucifer and he thought
[36:52] he was brighter than everybody else
[36:54] he thought he was more brighter he was
[36:57] more better he was more eloquent he was
[37:01] more the best man of the place and he
[37:07] could be able to rule because when he
[37:10] saw God what God has done
[37:13] he thought he was even greater than God
[37:16] but this morning I want to tell you this
[37:20] very same thing is taking place in our
[37:23] homes because somebody in the home wants
[37:28] to feel the better person somebody in
[37:32] the home want to criticize somebody else
[37:35] this is taking place and our work please
[37:38] somebody at work wants to feel a better
[37:41] person
[37:42] that spirit never died it never dies it
[37:45] is still
[37:45] and then you find this even in the
[37:49] school some person want to feel better
[37:52] than the other person he's greater than
[37:55] you he's better than you
[37:57] this is also taking place in the
[38:00] churches in the chat you'll find the one
[38:03] preacher thinks he is better than the
[38:05] other preacher the other preacher thinks
[38:07] he's greater than the other one the
[38:09] other one thinks he is he's more Aloka
[38:11] than the other one my brother my sister
[38:13] I might not be located
[38:15] I might not put up the words in the
[38:18] right places I might not say anything in
[38:21] the corner the consistency that you
[38:23] wanted but I know one thing that God has
[38:27] called me to preach this gospel to the
[38:31] time they're in a generation to preach
[38:33] the gospel in this message to know to
[38:36] people to know that we are playing on
[38:38] the other side and my only purpose that
[38:41] I'm preaching this gospel that I don't
[38:43] want to miss you I don't want to miss
[38:45] you because I want to see you on the
[38:47] other side while we sing the songs of
[38:50] Zion on the other side we know we can
[38:52] rejoice we can rejoice together
[38:55] sometimes people feel that they got a
[38:58] better ministry than the pastor and I
[39:01] want to tell you you cannot have a
[39:02] better ministry than the pasta no matter
[39:04] who you are no matter what you are no
[39:07] matter what grade you went to school or
[39:09] me no matter what what education you
[39:11] have you cannot be better than the
[39:13] pastor because the pastor was was was
[39:16] ordained to be a pastor he was called to
[39:19] be somebody was called to be somebody to
[39:22] live on because he has he has the the
[39:26] abilities of a shepherd you cannot be
[39:29] better than the teacher because the
[39:32] teacher was ordained to be a teacher and
[39:34] he would teach the flock you can be look
[39:37] you cannot be better than the Evangelist
[39:39] because he was called to bring in the
[39:42] flock and that's his ministry so what
[39:45] people want to do you see the spirit
[39:47] never died the greater the greater you
[39:50] want to be
[39:51] yourself but it is time that we can
[39:54] humble ourself and because of the same
[39:57] reason he was kicked down from heaven he
[40:02] was sent down from heaven for the same
[40:03] reason because he wanted to be greater
[40:06] than the one that that created him God
[40:10] created him but he wanted to be greater
[40:12] than God he wanted to show that he can
[40:15] do things better than God he was trying
[40:18] to get the people together you know this
[40:20] is also in the church today where you
[40:21] get people trying to try to come
[40:24] together trying to be a clique get
[40:27] together like cliques and try to form
[40:30] something against the church this is
[40:34] happening the spirit never died
[40:36] let spirit is there all the time it's
[40:38] come down from there it's right ya know
[40:40] and we find this morning that when he
[40:46] was sent down he never stopped he never
[40:50] stopped doing what he did so he brought
[40:52] two-thirds of his angels down and when
[40:55] he came down he was a very successful
[40:57] one he was defeated in heaven and when
[41:03] he came down it became a successful one
[41:06] he was in a position such as to seduce
[41:10] the first bride
[41:12] he said used the first bride he was
[41:15] successful then he was also successful
[41:18] in bringing in they saw the meek spirit
[41:21] into the church and you might say how
[41:25] could you talk like this
[41:26] bring in the sodomy condition in the
[41:28] church when you look at the churches
[41:30] today Sodom is inside the church
[41:32] ministers failed to realize that they
[41:34] could make it mess in the church
[41:36] ministers fail to realize they got
[41:38] nakedness in the front leading the
[41:40] people pastors have failed to recognize
[41:43] this son he was successful in putting
[41:47] shot him into the church he was very
[41:50] successful in seducing the second bride
[41:55] he was successful he seduced the second
[41:59] bride at neisha when they took on the
[42:04] Teletubbies ten
[42:05] Trinity spirit when they took on when
[42:08] the church took on the the spirit of the
[42:12] of the Roman Catholic Church he was
[42:16] successful in that and that's when we
[42:18] got Christmas we got Easter we got all
[42:20] these things all these other things we
[42:22] got and we have a tertiary the doctrine
[42:24] but the problem of God says but the
[42:27] problem of God says that this bride
[42:30] would not fail this bride will never be
[42:33] said used this bride will give is ready
[42:36] now to go over on the other side and
[42:39] this bride will never be defeated this
[42:41] bride will defeat the enemy this morning
[42:44] amen praise the Lord you happy praise
[42:46] God this morning amen
[42:48] and when he was right there in the
[42:50] Garden of Eden but you see God in all
[42:54] his glory God in all his power God in
[42:57] all his love what he did he did not
[43:01] leave he did not leave them as they were
[43:05] although they were seduced although they
[43:08] were defeated but God came along and
[43:12] when God came along what he did he gave
[43:16] them a promise and he gave them a great
[43:19] promise he said octave I'm not going to
[43:23] go through the whole thing after the
[43:25] kiss and he said the woman see you shall
[43:31] bruise the head of the setter
[43:33] hallelujah that was a great promise a
[43:36] great promise that he gave the church
[43:38] today and he knew that was when God's
[43:41] God gave a promise that this was meant
[43:43] to take place some day or the other
[43:45] where we will come back well it will
[43:49] come back to to Eden and this morning we
[43:54] find it he was still successful all
[43:56] along because he got hold of cake and
[44:02] when he got hold of Cain what happened
[44:06] King was so angry he was so despondent
[44:12] because he brought the sacrifice Abel
[44:16] brought the sacrifice and that is why
[44:18] this morning
[44:19] you cannot serve God without revelation
[44:22] you cannot serve God without the
[44:24] revelation in this message
[44:26] you wished in your time now Cain brought
[44:28] the sacrifice and Abel the sacrifice
[44:32] Abel must have been telling Kane listen
[44:35] yet this is what happened in the Garden
[44:36] of Eden this is who your father is and
[44:39] he was wrong
[44:41] Cain was a rock and you know what God
[44:46] did not leave God did not leave the God
[44:49] took some time God took some time and he
[44:54] came to King and he came to kill the
[44:58] Tholian King you will do better if you
[45:03] only do what your brother done but you
[45:08] see sometimes stubbornness sometimes
[45:12] elegance get hold of us and because
[45:15] arrogance gets all of us we want to do
[45:18] our own things we don't want to be in
[45:20] subjection to what God wants us to do
[45:22] and we move on from there and be fine
[45:25] this morning then what happened there
[45:28] was Cain slew his brother and even went
[45:31] on you see he didn't want to listen
[45:34] although God took the time to come and
[45:36] speak to him but he didn't want to
[45:37] listen you see sometimes when God is
[45:40] speaking to us we don't want to listen
[45:42] when God speak to us we need to heed the
[45:46] call of God we need to listen to God's
[45:48] Word and this is what happened he didn't
[45:50] listen and he went his way and you see
[45:53] this is it and then he even had it had a
[45:57] daughter see sometimes you know we
[45:58] question God we should never be
[46:00] questioning God this morning we should
[46:03] just accept what God says we should just
[46:05] accept God's what God gives us this
[46:09] morning we want too much and one more
[46:12] than what built what we can swallow this
[46:14] morning but God gives it to us in
[46:16] measures and we need to know the
[46:18] measures he gives us and therefore I say
[46:20] to you this morning it never stopped
[46:22] there he has a success yeah is the
[46:24] success of Satan when we find this
[46:29] morning Satan is also defeat
[46:32] along the way he has his success and
[46:37] after now he still got a success because
[46:40] he's placed the churches in such a
[46:41] condition that if somebody walks into
[46:45] the church he would know that his is not
[46:48] in the church if some really religious
[46:50] person some person that has a revelation
[46:51] works into a church you'll know that
[46:53] he's not in the church anymore and
[46:55] that's what that's how successful he's
[46:56] up to this point and we find this
[46:59] morning we find one of our our fathers
[47:04] of the faith Abraham Abraham father of
[47:08] the faith really a great man in the
[47:11] Bible we can really stories and we know
[47:15] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[47:18] God and that's what the Bible says that
[47:19] we can see it there and we find this
[47:22] morning Abraham when he went out when he
[47:28] was called out to be separated and you
[47:34] know although in God called the
[47:36] separation he needed two totally
[47:38] separate they don't want anything
[47:40] niggling around you and many times and
[47:43] God called the separation we have people
[47:45] we have things niggling around us but
[47:47] God doesn't want the niggles so I'm sure
[47:51] this morning Abram was such a bad you
[47:54] know like we have our favorites
[47:56] sometimes we have a nephew sometime we
[47:59] have a nice sometimes a grandchild
[48:01] sometimes a brother or a sister that's
[48:05] our favorites we have favorites we
[48:07] cannot deny that we cannot deny that any
[48:10] mother will tell you that she has a
[48:12] favorite any father will tell you that
[48:16] he has a favorite a my life
[48:20] Oh staying quiet let's say this morning
[48:24] Abram when he looked at his nephew he
[48:26] say this boy yeah amen hey this boy is
[48:31] my boy
[48:32] I'm not leaving him I'm taking him along
[48:36] it's come a lot let's go now not get up
[48:40] he says okay I'm going with my uncle and
[48:42] he gets on the grain the movie and then
[48:46] come they come to a place and to the
[48:50] plains of Mamre and when they come to
[48:53] mama knee they decided to camp and the
[48:56] plains of Mamre well why they decided to
[48:59] camp in the plains of Mamre it was good
[49:04] it was good
[49:06] Abram was happy because he heeded the
[49:08] call of God he needed to separate and
[49:11] now he's right there the plains of Mamre
[49:13] is standing there and I think maybe one
[49:16] night Abram came outside and then he
[49:19] stood out there and he began to look out
[49:21] there and he looked maybe looked at the
[49:24] lights and and the rest of the things
[49:26] out there you know that the glitter and
[49:29] the rest of the things of Sodom but when
[49:33] Abraham looked at that it meant nothing
[49:36] to Abram because he knew the things of
[49:39] this world will perish
[49:40] hey brain was looking at the heavenlies
[49:43] he never looked at the Stars he may be
[49:46] turned around and look at the desert he
[49:49] may be turned around and look at the
[49:50] fields he may be turned around and look
[49:52] at the world and when you look at these
[49:56] lights and this blind man the rest of
[49:58] the things and you know you know
[49:59] sometime when you're at home and when
[50:02] these boys starting to play music and
[50:04] stuff like that you can hear it buzzing
[50:06] you can be going to bed but you can hear
[50:09] this music buzzing it's coming from
[50:11] maybe one of the townships or maybe
[50:13] coming from one of the squatter camp or
[50:15] maybe coming from your neighbor's house
[50:16] this music is buzzing and I'm sure now
[50:19] while they look from memory they're
[50:21] looking out there and they're looking at
[50:22] the buzzing the music buzzing the lights
[50:25] glittering everything is taking place
[50:27] there Sodom is is a city on its own if I
[50:34] must've just looked at it it said ah
[50:35] this is not for me this is not for me
[50:39] you know I want to tell you something
[50:40] this morning you know the number of
[50:42] times I went past Sevilla the number of
[50:44] times I went past Suncoast when you see
[50:48] those lights and you see all those
[50:50] things they really really I want to tell
[50:53] you the encouraging
[50:54] you can be encouraged to go there many
[50:57] times people tell me well you won't ever
[50:58] be
[50:59] good music but I'm scared I want to tell
[51:03] you I'm scared they say you know in the
[51:05] samaya sometime my wife also said you
[51:07] know what I'm gonna have a meal you know
[51:09] you're going to go to that but me you're
[51:10] not gonna do anything else there but I'm
[51:12] scared you know why if somebody sees me
[51:15] coming out from there they're not going
[51:17] to tell me the day manova will tell the
[51:19] people I saw swear the sunny that's why
[51:21] I'm coming out from sabaha huh they look
[51:27] good after say he came he went and had
[51:29] in me room you see that is what we must
[51:34] know where we are we must know our
[51:36] position we must know where we are
[51:38] placed we must know where we go to
[51:40] they're not going to say are they going
[51:43] to tell the people maybe it's not in bad
[51:44] intentions many of us sometimes don't
[51:48] have bad intention sometime the people
[51:50] out in the world don't have bad
[51:51] intentions also so let's say I saw
[51:55] brother sunny in sabaha now the picture
[52:04] what is doing in Survivor is it
[52:07] immediate talk what is being in psychos
[52:10] it's immediate thought what you're doing
[52:13] there they're not saying you went for a
[52:15] meal they're not saying you went to to
[52:17] buy something because the shops there
[52:19] all they know you went to Sevilla so
[52:24] that's what I'm saying this morning we
[52:25] need to know where our feets are also we
[52:28] need to be safe as preachers of the
[52:31] gospel you need to know where you are
[52:33] you need to know your position God has
[52:36] placed you in your position so this was
[52:40] Abram the Royal seed of God unless it's
[52:43] pasture and message believer a message
[52:46] prophet Alleluia
[52:48] when he came out nothing could change
[52:50] his mind
[52:51] yeah isn't Raman el denominational
[52:55] believer he comes out lot comes out and
[52:57] when he looks he looks out there he
[53:00] looks at that place there immediately is
[53:02] hard to start talking and when he looked
[53:06] there he sees a hold it man hey this is
[53:09] something beautiful lovely hear the
[53:12] music
[53:13] lovely we can dance to this music lovely
[53:16] everything is good that's what he looked
[53:18] at for him a nominal denominational
[53:22] believer and this is where I want to say
[53:26] you the prosperity gospel stats the
[53:30] prosperity gospel starts because not in
[53:33] his mind you can make that's where I can
[53:35] make the money
[53:36] that's where can make my living that's
[53:39] where I can do everything because that
[53:41] was his destination when he looked out
[53:43] there yes you say okay you know what how
[53:47] can you how can you immediately put this
[53:49] on yes today you find everywhere you go
[53:53] to church anyway I can challenge you
[53:55] this morning you go to church it's only
[53:56] money
[53:57] you're going to church it's money you're
[54:00] going to church its nakedness you go to
[54:02] church everything that is in trouble and
[54:05] that is why Jesus said like in the days
[54:08] of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[54:10] the Son of Man because it is there it is
[54:12] right in the church leave the world out
[54:14] the world is another place it's in the
[54:17] church this is a nominal nominal
[54:20] denomination of believer now he sees he
[54:23] sees the attraction there there is an
[54:25] exception yes and he watches it and you
[54:32] see the devil is coming the devil is so
[54:37] cunning he knows now lot and his uncle
[54:41] Abram I'm a very good relationship and
[54:46] I'm gonna fight now when he saw you see
[54:49] the devil sees what you have what your
[54:51] design is that's what the devil is
[54:54] looking at it here their desire now when
[54:57] he saw watch the design then he says no
[54:59] I don't go to loved now go to his
[55:01] headsman now it goes through his
[55:04] headsman and then he puts the strike he
[55:08] puts the strife and that is what I'm
[55:10] saying this morning it puts your strife
[55:12] between the headsman and then now this
[55:15] is exactly what happens in the church
[55:17] maybe the deacon is a good brother
[55:19] maybe the the trustees are good but then
[55:22] the youth the devil uses somebody from
[55:24] the congregate
[55:26] somebody to use that is a high tight
[55:29] spin unite tight there
[55:31] so he uses him to come in and try to
[55:34] disrupt everything in the church so this
[55:37] morning you find he was not not looked
[55:41] at this thing he said hey you know what
[55:43] this is going to be mine so there comes
[55:47] the devil puts a strife between the
[55:50] headsman and you know Abram being a son
[55:55] of God even as being a prophet of God
[55:59] even knew hey this is not for me and
[56:03] then one day he came out he says hey
[56:06] before you know it this happens sometime
[56:08] at home it happens at home and when the
[56:13] strife at home you know between the
[56:15] mother and the daughter the son decides
[56:18] they gotta go
[56:19] the thousand go sometime between two
[56:22] brothers this safe one brother decides
[56:27] they let me go you see it happens the
[56:31] devil puts a psyche in danger and when
[56:33] the devil puts a stripe there now and
[56:35] you know it makes it so bad every muscle
[56:38] came out it so these guys might be
[56:40] fighting for the grazing land and
[56:42] fighting and fighting and he said hey
[56:44] you don't want hey this is no good
[56:47] we can't live fighting and that is the
[56:50] real reality believers kind of fighting
[56:53] you know so what he did it came out call
[56:58] him rot come here my son choose this day
[57:02] which way you want to go you have the
[57:05] east
[57:06] you have the west you have them not you
[57:09] have this out choose this day which way
[57:12] you want to go nicely this is a believer
[57:16] I believe I wouldn't want anything for
[57:18] himself a believer will always want to
[57:21] give the first prevalence when you come
[57:23] to a point this money when you come to a
[57:26] point when you want everything for
[57:28] yourself remember where you offer so
[57:32] yeah is he giving the choice and gave
[57:37] the choice to him
[57:38] and I can tell you this morning not much
[57:41] that said you know what I saw last night
[57:43] what I saw last night cannot change my
[57:47] mind cannot change my heart it's a
[57:51] diagram this is my lord I think green he
[57:56] was a nominal nominal denominational
[57:59] believer you went out there you know for
[58:02] you this morning to go out somewhere
[58:04] with us nakedness for you to go out
[58:06] somewhere with is ratalie for you to go
[58:09] out somewhere with this pattern where
[58:11] for you to go somewhere with these chaos
[58:14] you cannot stand it as a believer you
[58:18] cannot stand and if you can stand that
[58:20] then there is something wrong with your
[58:22] experience something wrong with your
[58:25] experience if you can stand those things
[58:27] you know sometimes your cars going past
[58:29] oh you know I think you know what
[58:32] whether these people are deaf you know
[58:35] you you you you can't stand that anymore
[58:37] and today you hear the songs that's been
[58:40] played the guy would be dancing to
[58:43] somebody's wedding his mother you know
[58:47] that he's dancing to somebody that is
[58:49] wearing his mother's letting his father
[58:51] selling his sister's wedding everybody
[58:52] is dancing to that see where the devil
[58:55] got everything he got everything is
[58:58] successful in everything that he's doing
[59:00] because he's not attacking the people
[59:02] out there those people he's not worried
[59:04] about he's attacking the people in the
[59:05] church and this is my message today the
[59:08] devil is attacking the people in the
[59:10] church and the church has to have the
[59:12] power to defeat me hallelujah praise the
[59:16] name of Jesus and yeah not decided to
[59:20] pack up and go it must have been said in
[59:25] his heart because that was his choice to
[59:31] bring in him so sometime when people
[59:34] leave when people leave home
[59:36] your son leaves home you are sad in your
[59:40] heart to see your son leave home
[59:41] you're sad in your heart to see your
[59:43] daughter Nemo at the able that must have
[59:45] been in the same situation but said it
[59:47] is hard to see his nephew go but he had
[59:50] to let him go because God is
[59:54] they're not long from there we're not
[59:56] going to go through the whole team now
[59:57] because there's so much I don't know I
[59:59] don't have a time my battery is gone and
[1:00:02] my watch but I'm just using it then what
[1:00:06] happened not long after that they got a
[1:00:09] message Abraham gets a message it says
[1:00:14] your nephew now your nephew is
[1:00:17] recaptured and this nephew is captured
[1:00:22] they're taking his wife taking his
[1:00:24] children taking everything taking his
[1:00:28] position and their brother even set it
[1:00:31] up now you see this is what it is
[1:00:34] strength should not bring hatred between
[1:00:38] the brother and anything any strength
[1:00:42] should not stop the president from
[1:00:45] continuing and this is what the devil
[1:00:48] has done Abram see he had the love of
[1:00:51] God he had the Spirit of Christ they
[1:00:53] gathered these things up when he
[1:00:56] gathered all these things and he said go
[1:00:57] I gather these men I think it was a
[1:00:59] hundred three hundred I wouldn't know
[1:01:02] the figure now finish read that and he
[1:01:05] gathered all his men three men and he
[1:01:07] went after those kings why because that
[1:01:11] was his brother that was his brother
[1:01:15] when you see your brother down and out
[1:01:17] when you see your brother finished when
[1:01:22] you have specie your brother defeated it
[1:01:24] is your duty my brother it is your duty
[1:01:27] to go after him
[1:01:28] it is not duty to chase and to get him
[1:01:32] to beam and come and make him stand it's
[1:01:34] fallen situation he must stand and this
[1:01:37] morning I want to tell you if you do
[1:01:40] what Jesus did Jesus left the thousands
[1:01:43] and he went after the one and a preacher
[1:01:46] say I don't need up anything
[1:01:48] I don't need up anything if anybody want
[1:01:51] to leave can leave if anybody want to go
[1:01:53] can go I don't need anything I said well
[1:01:57] it depends where you where where you've
[1:02:00] got your spirit from you see now if
[1:02:03] Jesus
[1:02:05] this is how this is what if we preaching
[1:02:07] the gospel of Jesus Christ this is what
[1:02:08] we have to do it now if I'm centered up
[1:02:11] any width it finished and he had at God
[1:02:17] with him there's no two-way about that
[1:02:19] he went and slaughtered the kings and
[1:02:22] his father's the kings brought
[1:02:24] everything I attended back to not and on
[1:02:27] his way back from the story of the king
[1:02:32] he met Melchizedek hallelujah on his way
[1:02:37] from the slaughter of the kings he met
[1:02:40] his Melchizedek hallelujah and when he
[1:02:44] met Melchizedek it was a greatest moment
[1:02:47] of his life this morning you can have
[1:02:51] Malka dick in your life but provided you
[1:02:54] squatted the kings in your life because
[1:02:56] you had many kings in your life if you
[1:02:58] can slaughter them you can beat
[1:02:59] Melchizedek but if you can't start it
[1:03:01] you can't meet Melchizedek yeah it was
[1:03:04] when you went along Cain and you can
[1:03:07] meet them your your your kings that
[1:03:10] align within you man this hatred lying
[1:03:17] backbiting all those things are sitting
[1:03:21] on you kill those kings and meet
[1:03:25] Melchizedek this morning you will never
[1:03:28] go wrong and as long as you do that you
[1:03:30] see the the separation the separation
[1:03:34] did not stop the Brotherhood from saving
[1:03:39] his brother from a defeat this morning
[1:03:41] and this is where Satan this is where
[1:03:43] the enemy was defeated the enemy was
[1:03:48] defeated and Abraham defeated the enemy
[1:03:50] because he had no guy looking hallelujah
[1:03:53] praise the Lord Amen how much more time
[1:03:56] do I have
[1:03:59] there was a time when we find the whole
[1:04:05] Jewish nation the entire Jewish race was
[1:04:10] going to be annihilated
[1:04:14] and God has made a promise that this was
[1:04:20] his people but everything was set for
[1:04:25] them to be elevated we find this morning
[1:04:29] we look at the Jewish race and when they
[1:04:37] were under captivity
[1:04:38] it was Mordechai but Mordechai looked at
[1:04:43] this and you can read it in the book of
[1:04:47] Esther I think it's a fun telling fourth
[1:04:50] chapter you'll find what happened wanna
[1:04:54] cry when he heard that Helen was going
[1:04:57] to destroy the entire Jewish nation what
[1:05:03] did you do
[1:05:04] eat Ghana you see this is where we have
[1:05:07] to learn prayer we need to get down and
[1:05:11] play in this time of distress
[1:05:14] we need to pray in this time of distress
[1:05:17] we need to go down on our knees and this
[1:05:19] morning we find the entire nation the
[1:05:22] entire world is under knees in the past
[1:05:25] there was just a few people going down
[1:05:27] in the knees on a Sunday morning
[1:05:29] but a few people bring down on the knees
[1:05:31] on a Wednesday night a few people
[1:05:32] pulling down on their knees during that
[1:05:34] during the course of the week but now we
[1:05:36] could find the entire world in the
[1:05:41] streets everywhere crying out crying out
[1:05:46] where are you God what was there all the
[1:05:48] time
[1:05:48] he was there all the time he never
[1:05:51] changed his position he never changed
[1:05:53] this place he was there all the time and
[1:05:56] this morning it behooves us this morning
[1:06:00] to know the time that we are living in
[1:06:03] and yet was Mordecai put on sackcloth
[1:06:07] and ashes although there was a degree
[1:06:08] that nobody should wear secular
[1:06:10] philosophy but the goddess sacra the
[1:06:12] nauseous
[1:06:13] he didn't care anything he went down and
[1:06:15] he they started to pray and he started
[1:06:18] to pray and I tell you what happened
[1:06:21] then they call for Esther
[1:06:24] Esther came and they all got together
[1:06:28] they started playing and Esther went on
[1:06:29] a fast also and they were known a fast
[1:06:32] and playing sometimes we think like you
[1:06:34] know fasting and claim fasting and
[1:06:36] praying is nothing but I want to tell
[1:06:38] you fasting and praying is dynamic it's
[1:06:41] something that we should be doing we
[1:06:43] should not have any excuse for that
[1:06:45] and here was then playing and and what
[1:06:48] happened
[1:06:49] you know she went and and she even said
[1:06:53] you know what what happened to the king
[1:06:54] doesn't accept me but yeah was it
[1:06:58] because of the fasting and the player
[1:07:00] the fasting and the plan the king had to
[1:07:05] accept and as it came out with a scepter
[1:07:09] he gave an a scepter and she received it
[1:07:12] and this morning and when that meeting
[1:07:15] went on they had to go to a banquet
[1:07:18] molokai and the rest of them they had to
[1:07:22] go in the timberlands they all went to a
[1:07:24] banquet and at the banquet there was two
[1:07:26] banquet set and they have to discuss and
[1:07:29] I'll tell you one thing the enemy can be
[1:07:33] defeated through player your enemy can
[1:07:36] be defeated through fasting your enemy
[1:07:39] can't be defeated because you take on
[1:07:41] the name of Jesus Christ nothing can
[1:07:44] stop it your enemy is defeated he can be
[1:07:47] successful outside the message but in
[1:07:50] the message is unsuccessful he's a
[1:07:52] nothing in the message this morning a
[1:07:54] man and yet was Mordecai playing any
[1:07:58] one-handed he had a gallows made for
[1:08:03] Mordecai he prepared especially for
[1:08:06] Mordecai and what happens after
[1:08:10] everything finished after everything was
[1:08:14] finished the very same gal that the
[1:08:21] enemy prepared for Mordecai had to be
[1:08:27] hanged
[1:08:28] at the same girls the enemy was defeated
[1:08:34] hallelujah the enemy was defeated ready
[1:08:39] because there was somebody who took up
[1:08:42] the stand and the Jewish race was saved
[1:08:46] and the enemy was defeated hallelujah
[1:08:50] praise Oh glory to God this morning
[1:08:55] the enemy was also defeated and camel
[1:09:00] there was a one common and the enemy was
[1:09:04] defeated day you find this morning
[1:09:07] Elijah Elisha had to come and he found
[1:09:13] these prophets of Baal all prophesizing
[1:09:17] and the same thing we have this morning
[1:09:20] the prophets of Baal prophesy one God
[1:09:23] prophesied we say the rain is going to
[1:09:25] come and kill this coronavirus one guy
[1:09:28] is prophesied many people will die
[1:09:30] who doesn't know many people will die
[1:09:32] one of us know many people are going to
[1:09:34] die you don't have to prophesied that
[1:09:36] and some people are listening to it and
[1:09:38] they're getting so excited because it's
[1:09:40] a prophesized many people are going to
[1:09:42] die many people are going to get sick
[1:09:44] who don't know that that's all in the
[1:09:45] news is that a prophecy that's not a
[1:09:49] prophecy but prophecy comes it will tell
[1:09:52] you something that is not happening
[1:09:53] before it happens and they couldn't tell
[1:09:57] before it happened only when is
[1:09:58] happening now he said if people are
[1:09:59] gonna die all of us know that people
[1:10:02] gonna die you get an uneducated man in
[1:10:04] the road you tell you the people gonna
[1:10:05] die so what do you want a prophecy for
[1:10:07] that so here was the improper saying the
[1:10:10] same people this one the same proper top
[1:10:13] valve are still in existence the spirits
[1:10:16] never died let spirits oh yeah
[1:10:18] so we have to be careful this morning
[1:10:21] and there was a showdown showdown had to
[1:10:25] come and Elijah had to be elected
[1:10:31] answers he had to replace the word he
[1:10:35] had to take the word and place it in the
[1:10:37] right place he had to put the altar in
[1:10:40] his position
[1:10:41] and then he said to them come on let's
[1:10:47] have this showdown and what happened
[1:10:50] there Elijah because he had the presence
[1:10:54] of God he had the presence of God a
[1:10:56] demon and he defeated the enemy all the
[1:11:01] prophets had to die because he Leiter
[1:11:03] was a successful one because he had the
[1:11:07] presence of God
[1:11:08] enemy was defeated once more right there
[1:11:11] at Carmel this morning we find the enemy
[1:11:20] had another showdown
[1:11:23] the enemy has another shoulder the enemy
[1:11:27] came to Calvary we find this morning he
[1:11:37] was defeated at Calvary once more we
[1:11:42] find that Jesus was offered everything
[1:11:49] is he Satan the devil he doesn't play
[1:11:54] games because he knows every tactic
[1:11:59] because he is coming from the presence
[1:12:03] of God and he knows everything he knows
[1:12:07] how to act he knows what to do you see
[1:12:13] and over the ages the word was lost then
[1:12:23] what was misinterpreted misplaced and
[1:12:31] people just continued the people that
[1:12:35] were looking for Jesus couldn't find him
[1:12:38] because they were in another dimension
[1:12:43] they were looking at things differently
[1:12:45] they were looking at the scriptures
[1:12:47] differently so they couldn't find their
[1:12:51] Messiah
[1:12:53] and it came to pass that God allowed his
[1:13:02] son because that was the only way that
[1:13:06] our redemption could take place and was
[1:13:11] the only way that we could go to Calvary
[1:13:14] that's the only way that we could go
[1:13:16] back to the Garden of Eden so what
[1:13:20] happened right over there they took him
[1:13:25] they whipped him they spat on him they
[1:13:31] did everything that they could do the
[1:13:37] death of the Cross is one of the most
[1:13:41] cruel deaths because when you're hanging
[1:13:45] on the cross your body gives in when
[1:13:49] you're hanging on the cross the whole
[1:13:51] body collapses and so this is what
[1:13:56] happened when he went there and when
[1:14:00] they placed him on that cross he said
[1:14:03] he'll isleye lama sabachthani which
[1:14:06] means my God my God why those and then
[1:14:11] he said it was finished right there the
[1:14:17] enemy was defeated right at the cross of
[1:14:20] Calvary but in the defeat this morning
[1:14:23] there was two people on the other either
[1:14:26] side in that defeat one had to call
[1:14:31] ahead one had to go to paradise because
[1:14:36] that one recognized and yet a revelation
[1:14:39] although he never studied the Bible
[1:14:41] although he never study the message he
[1:14:43] uh no he never studied anything but he
[1:14:45] had a revelation of who he was on the
[1:14:48] cross and when he turn on the side he
[1:14:52] looked at the other guy he said save
[1:14:54] yourself but they brought to a prisoners
[1:14:58] but the woman had the revelation but one
[1:15:01] didn't
[1:15:02] so we are back to the idiom equally
[1:15:05] condition this money and we find this
[1:15:08] morning that right there
[1:15:11] Jesus went right down he went right down
[1:15:14] to hell he took the keys of death and
[1:15:18] hell and the grave and he came out and I
[1:15:23] could imagine this morning
[1:15:24] Ezekiel standing there and while he's
[1:15:27] mocking they said maybe I can just have
[1:15:28] a look who is that
[1:15:29] he says I can see that one that one was
[1:15:32] the wheel within the wheel hallelujah he
[1:15:34] says I can't look at I recognized him
[1:15:36] praise the Lord and Daniel was standing
[1:15:39] there and says yes that's the one
[1:15:41] I see you not on a mountain he is the
[1:15:43] one that was there in the lion's den
[1:15:45] change like Meshach and Abednego came up
[1:15:47] there and then when they came in to look
[1:15:49] they said yes this is the one he was the
[1:15:51] fourth man in the fire glory to God this
[1:15:53] morning hallelujah yeah enemy is
[1:15:56] defeated and the enemy can take it
[1:15:58] defeated in your life on to this morning
[1:16:00] praise our Lord this morning and that's
[1:16:03] what Calvary was Calvin he was taking us
[1:16:06] back that same shepherd was bruised at
[1:16:09] Calvary we go back to the in any
[1:16:12] condition this morning how they knew
[1:16:14] there was a showdown there was among
[1:16:16] common defeat there was a Calvary
[1:16:20] defeated among Carmel defeat and a
[1:16:25] Calvary defeat now they were there is
[1:16:28] amongst sunset defeat hallelujah when
[1:16:32] the word was invaded the word came out
[1:16:35] hallelujah we not have the written word
[1:16:38] and the spoken word we have the entire
[1:16:40] word revealed to us we know where we are
[1:16:42] we know who we are we know where we come
[1:16:45] from we know where we're going through
[1:16:46] this morning we know this morning we can
[1:16:49] cherish the prophet we can change the
[1:16:51] prophets message this morning knowing
[1:16:53] that he is the only one that came to
[1:16:55] take us to tune to prepare this bride to
[1:16:58] go on on the other side this bride
[1:17:01] hallelujah this bride has never failed
[1:17:03] although there was time that that we
[1:17:06] have our child we have our temptation we
[1:17:09] have everything that is going with us
[1:17:11] and this morning but but the enemy
[1:17:14] is defeated because the book is open the
[1:17:18] book is open the full word is revealed
[1:17:22] we have nothing to worry about all we
[1:17:25] need this morning is to stay with the
[1:17:27] word stay in line stay in line with this
[1:17:30] word of God and as long as we can stay
[1:17:32] in line with this word of God it says
[1:17:34] the world has come and now that the
[1:17:36] bride has made herself ready to enter
[1:17:39] into the other dimension this morning we
[1:17:41] are going to move on to the next
[1:17:42] dimension and that's not going to be
[1:17:43] very long as we see these things
[1:17:45] happening around us
[1:17:46] the Bible says lift up your heads for
[1:17:48] your Redemption draweth nigh hallelujah
[1:17:51] praise the Lord this morning amen
[1:17:54] we have the three times the enemy has
[1:17:58] been defeated
[1:17:59] you know God it's so thoughtful about
[1:18:04] his people this morning God is so
[1:18:07] thoughtful about his people God never
[1:18:10] wanted one to perish he never wanted one
[1:18:13] to perish he never wanted anyone to
[1:18:16] perish you know I love the story of the
[1:18:19] rich young ruler every time when I read
[1:18:23] that story I preached many many sermons
[1:18:26] on the rich young ruler and I loved it
[1:18:29] so much because God took time to come
[1:18:34] and talk to me God took some time to
[1:18:38] come and talk to me he was afforded the
[1:18:42] opportunity of his life many a time you
[1:18:47] say you know what if I was a little
[1:18:48] ruler I should just go and do that but
[1:18:51] this morning you are in the same
[1:18:52] situation this morning you are just like
[1:18:54] the rich son you are standing right
[1:18:56] there as a rich young ruler and you
[1:18:58] sitting at your home this month you are
[1:18:59] just like the rich young ruler a God
[1:19:03] took time and this morning God is taking
[1:19:06] time through my voice to speak to you
[1:19:09] this morning and as he spoke to him you
[1:19:14] know he was such a good man it must have
[1:19:17] been a little con man he must have had
[1:19:20] everything in his life and because he
[1:19:22] had everything in his life whatever
[1:19:26] he came to God he met God face to face
[1:19:30] none of us will ever have that
[1:19:32] opportunity this morning and many people
[1:19:35] in these days never had the opportunity
[1:19:37] to meet God face to face why I say made
[1:19:41] God many people who say that this is a
[1:19:43] son of God a second person of the
[1:19:45] Trinity no he was God because there is
[1:19:48] none rule and a revelation and he knew
[1:19:50] it was God because when he came to him
[1:19:53] and asked him good master what must I do
[1:19:55] that I may inherit eternal life
[1:19:57] hallelujah
[1:19:59] and he said why callest thou me good
[1:20:03] because there's nobody else that is good
[1:20:05] it says only God is good topic of God is
[1:20:10] good see he recognized it and when he
[1:20:13] recognized it he saw this was God I
[1:20:19] wonder was it apply it was a very simple
[1:20:22] tip line because God saw straight
[1:20:25] through his heart
[1:20:27] what was his problem what was his
[1:20:31] problem and his problem was what he had
[1:20:37] many things that he had he had nice cars
[1:20:41] and a nice house big bank balanced many
[1:20:47] servants many of everything and today if
[1:20:52] you are sitting there he's speaking to
[1:20:55] you right now so he went away a defeated
[1:21:02] man because he couldn't do that and all
[1:21:08] he done was returned to his normal work
[1:21:14] and you see this is what it needs some
[1:21:17] time on you arrogant this is what it is
[1:21:19] when you are stabbing some time this is
[1:21:22] what it is he went out not thinking what
[1:21:26] was asked of him to do when he went out
[1:21:29] he said I would build bigger plans you
[1:21:35] see this is making a mockery of God well
[1:21:37] many people this morning
[1:21:39] make a mockery out of this message I
[1:21:41] want to tell you this morning you can
[1:21:43] make a mockery out of this message this
[1:21:45] message is real this message is real
[1:21:49] it's come from the tone of God it's an
[1:21:52] unbending big advance I will pack the
[1:21:56] bands up I will make more money I will
[1:22:00] beat this and I will be dead but the
[1:22:02] same night you say he couldn't defeat
[1:22:06] his enemy the only reason he couldn't
[1:22:08] defeat his enemy was because he had too
[1:22:11] much so when he went out and the same
[1:22:19] one night the angel of the Lord came
[1:22:22] down and said thou fool thou fool your
[1:22:31] life is required tonight nobody can make
[1:22:36] that decision people are scared scared
[1:22:40] to get today Corona Corona everywhere
[1:22:44] you go is Corona I want to tell it in
[1:22:47] this morning if God is not finished with
[1:22:50] you
[1:22:51] there's nothing can touch you he will
[1:22:55] take you whether its Corona with a
[1:22:58] accident whatever it is he will take you
[1:23:01] when he's finished so you should not be
[1:23:04] worried as a believer when your time is
[1:23:07] up you will go and call him down fool
[1:23:10] fool and what the Bible says about a
[1:23:14] fool this morning the Bible says a fool
[1:23:17] has said in his heart that there is no
[1:23:20] God
[1:23:20] and yet he met God so he didn't believe
[1:23:24] it was God
[1:23:25] so that is why he said in his heart so
[1:23:27] he couldn't defeat his enemy because of
[1:23:30] his position and this morning we look at
[1:23:33] the color at the opposite side we look
[1:23:37] at Zacchaeus hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:23:41] Zacchaeus was trying to find out who
[1:23:44] this man is
[1:23:45] Zacchaeus was trying to find out you
[1:23:47] know sometimes a key has become the
[1:23:48] school lesson for people but I'll tell
[1:23:50] you this is more than a Sunday School
[1:23:51] lesson this is something for that to
[1:23:53] think about what really happened in
[1:23:55] Zacchaeus is like you know we've used to
[1:23:57] sing this song Zacchaeus climbing up the
[1:23:59] tree you know but I want to tell you
[1:24:01] this is more than that if you have a
[1:24:02] revelation and yet what Zacchaeus up
[1:24:05] there it's time to get a glimpse of
[1:24:09] Jesus Christ and when he was trying to
[1:24:12] get a glimpse of Jesus Christ Jesus came
[1:24:15] right there seemed like this morning as
[1:24:18] we were as the pastor was playing he was
[1:24:21] playing the scripture that you have
[1:24:22] really hallelujah
[1:24:25] so if your heart desire if you have a
[1:24:28] desire in your heart to see God you're
[1:24:30] gonna see God and here was suckiest and
[1:24:35] Jesus came and stood right underneath
[1:24:38] and when he stood right under there he
[1:24:41] called him down he said Zacchaeus come
[1:24:42] down I'm coming to your house but there
[1:24:46] was a great great what he called despair
[1:24:51] among the people this man yet this man
[1:24:55] dead Scaletta evil man he wants to go to
[1:25:00] his house that's who God came for he
[1:25:04] came for the tax collector it came for
[1:25:07] the evil he came for those that couldn't
[1:25:09] reach out to him he didn't come for
[1:25:11] those that can reach out to you came for
[1:25:13] those that cannot be taught me so you
[1:25:15] see the Dalek contrast this morning
[1:25:17] between the rich young ruler and
[1:25:19] Zacchaeus Zacchaeus accepted life and
[1:25:22] been and the devil and the enemy in his
[1:25:26] life was defeated he said Lord I will
[1:25:28] give four times more than when I took I
[1:25:31] will give more than what I do if
[1:25:34] somebody if somebody even comes with a
[1:25:36] false accusation is that I give them -
[1:25:39] because he regarded the things of the
[1:25:42] world as nothing and this morning you
[1:25:46] can regard the things of this world
[1:25:48] that's nothing and this morning our
[1:25:52] saves that you can go and and do many
[1:25:59] things in your life because everybody is
[1:26:02] looking for a good life you cannot find
[1:26:05] anybody that is not looking for a good
[1:26:07] life but let your good life be channeled
[1:26:11] and be and be in line with the Word of
[1:26:14] God
[1:26:14] your good life with all the money that
[1:26:17] you want with every good thing that you
[1:26:20] want because God gives good things and
[1:26:22] because God gives good things he doesn't
[1:26:24] want you to neglect serving and what is
[1:26:28] happening today because we get so much
[1:26:30] we neglect serving God we don't even go
[1:26:33] to a wedding today night service now I
[1:26:35] think my wedding today night service is
[1:26:36] going to be full we don't even want to
[1:26:39] come to a Sunday morning service because
[1:26:41] you want to check the time I want to
[1:26:43] tell you the time is at hand that time
[1:26:46] is at hand I'm closing we find the
[1:26:51] prodigal son the prodigal son we know
[1:26:57] the story very well because I don't want
[1:26:59] to I don't want to go too much in depth
[1:27:02] with each I just want to give you the
[1:27:03] overview of the prodigal son
[1:27:04] now the prodigal son he had a good
[1:27:08] father he could have a good house he had
[1:27:12] everything but he wanted his inheritance
[1:27:16] he wanted dad you know what death I am
[1:27:21] tired of this life then only church only
[1:27:26] prayer meeting only fasting only playing
[1:27:30] I am tired of this life then I'm sick
[1:27:34] now I need to go out and find what is
[1:27:38] out there I need to go there you see the
[1:27:41] devil comes in there yes the enemy comes
[1:27:43] in there and against control of you and
[1:27:46] I fight I love this boy and he said son
[1:27:50] because he loved him he didn't want to
[1:27:53] to disappoint him you know when you love
[1:27:57] somebody you don't want to disappoint
[1:27:59] that somebody nobody wants to do that as
[1:28:03] much today
[1:28:04] all of us would never did Manny mi night
[1:28:07] pastor Ronnie
[1:28:09] if you love somebody you don't want to
[1:28:11] disappoint that somebody he loved his
[1:28:12] son too much so he said I'm okay son
[1:28:17] Tico's even out there he saw said aiya
[1:28:24] he saw Suncoast he saw well Coast he saw
[1:28:29] all the coasts
[1:28:30] he had a ball of a time drank himself
[1:28:34] sick he danced himself sick he played
[1:28:37] everything sick and then eventually when
[1:28:40] he looked down even sold his last pair
[1:28:43] of shoes see what the devil can do to
[1:28:45] you this morning yeah that's what the
[1:28:47] devil can do to you your enemy can do
[1:28:49] this to you when you look down you look
[1:28:52] down at his feet and he said I don't
[1:28:54] even had a shoe and you know in the in
[1:28:57] the old days in the Old Testament days
[1:28:59] only slaves didn't wish so he became a
[1:29:03] slave to his enemy and then he went out
[1:29:06] looking for a job but he had so much see
[1:29:09] this is what happened and he went out
[1:29:12] after waiting waiting not going on and
[1:29:14] the only job that he could find wasn't a
[1:29:17] pigpen that was awesome you go there and
[1:29:23] when he started to do he went in there
[1:29:27] to take the job because he was desperate
[1:29:31] he's enemy put him in such a situation
[1:29:34] that he was desperate so he went there
[1:29:37] and he started to mind no swine mmm and
[1:29:42] then in the same process he started to
[1:29:45] eat people food
[1:29:47] sadly the husk and you know buddies
[1:29:50] picked food this morning I don't have to
[1:29:52] tell you and then one day while sitting
[1:29:58] down there he came back to his mind as I
[1:30:03] and a daughter will come back to them
[1:30:07] and that is why the Bible says clean up
[1:30:11] your child in the ways of the Lord so
[1:30:14] when they grow up they will not depart
[1:30:16] from the faith so here was an enemy now
[1:30:20] defeating this boy
[1:30:23] girl thank his feet and he must have
[1:30:27] said in my father's house there are so
[1:30:33] many servants we have so much up for

[1:31:00] father's love blood is his boy whom he

[1:38:13] I just want to encourage you we are
[1:38:20] living in the last days this is not
[1:38:24] something to try to put fear in your

[1:42:42] for bringing the word we are living in a
[1:42:45] time where we have to get closer to God
[1:42:48] we have to become desperate hey man we
[1:42:51] have to let off everything else we have
[1:42:55] to surrender ourselves totally to God
[1:42:56] and become consecrated unto Him just
[1:42:59] like in our desperation when when there

[1:43:20] Abraham began to take on the
[1:43:23] intercessory role and he began to in the
[1:43:25] seat to God to intercede on behalf of
[1:43:28] these people and we are in that
