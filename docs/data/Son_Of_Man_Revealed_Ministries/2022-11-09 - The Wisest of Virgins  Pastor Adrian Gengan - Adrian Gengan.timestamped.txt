[1:32] Now in the name of our Lord and Savior
[1:34] Jesus Christ
[1:35] Thanksgiving amen amen I greet you all
[1:39] in the precious name of our Lord and
[1:40] Savior Jesus Christ amen amen
[1:43] amen
[1:45] good to see every one of you back in the
[1:46] house of the Lord amen to worship Him
[1:49] amen we'll speak this evening just take
[1:51] a little parable of the Lord the way he
[1:54] took the parable of the ten virgins and
[1:56] we'll speak on the wisest of virgins
[1:58] amen
[2:00] so let's go to Matthew 25
[2:03] so you know Matthew 24 is where they're
[2:06] asking Jesus
[2:07] When shall the sign of the coming be and
[2:10] the end of all things
[2:11] and Jesus is describing the
[2:14] circumstances that will be upon the
[2:16] Earth and then this 25 is a continuation
[2:20] and he's saying then shall the Kingdom
[2:22] of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins
[2:25] which took their lamps and went forward
[2:27] to meet the bridegroom
[2:30] amen they went for to meet the
[2:33] bridegroom so what were they doing they
[2:35] were looking forward to the coming of
[2:36] the Lord
[2:38] so we know we have a rich heritage
[2:43] of the faith that's been passed down to
[2:45] us so from Paul's Day from the disciples
[2:48] day because Jesus gave them a promise I
[2:50] will come again so they were looking for
[2:52] the bridegroom from their first age
[2:55] Jesus never told them that it was going
[2:57] to take two thousand years of church
[2:59] history all of them were looking for
[3:01] that bridegroom now remember when the
[3:04] prophet is preaching about the ten
[3:06] virgins he tell you the cloth is laid
[3:08] across all seven Church ages
[3:11] and the pattern is cut out because the
[3:14] five y's and the five foolish are coming
[3:16] right through seven Church ages okay so
[3:19] you just wanted to get that down there
[3:20] in that verse so they're going forward
[3:22] to meet the bridegroom and five of them
[3:24] were wise and five were foolish
[3:27] they that were foolish took their lamps
[3:29] and took no oil with them so we know the
[3:32] oil is a type of the Holy Spirit but the
[3:35] wise took oil in their vessels with
[3:38] their lamps
[3:39] so not only did they have oil in the
[3:41] lamp they had a special vessel on their
[3:44] side that they kept extra oil in
[3:47] so they had a double portion of oil
[3:51] but the wise took oil in the vessels
[3:53] with a lamp while the bridegroom carried
[3:56] so there's the 2000 years of church
[3:58] history now they all slumbered and slept
[4:02] so here we come now to the Pentecostal
[4:05] age
[4:06] right Lou that passed Wesley had passed
[4:09] the Pentecostals that had a niche
[4:10] initial outpouring
[4:13] but they slumbered and slept and settled
[4:15] for denominationalism and at midnight
[4:18] there was a cry made
[4:19] behold the bridegroom cometh going out
[4:23] to meet him
[4:24] now we know what Ministry that is right
[4:26] amen then all 10 all those virgins arose
[4:29] and trimmed their lamps because he
[4:32] initiated the greatest healing Revival
[4:36] and out of that Revival you see all the
[4:38] other evangelists go out into the field
[4:40] like Oral Roberts TL has born and all of
[4:43] these Mighty Men A.A Allen
[4:46] so he started an initial healing Revival
[4:49] there
[4:52] all the one all the versions arose and
[4:54] trimmed their lamps
[4:56] so they're making preparation if you're
[4:58] trimming your lamp you're making
[4:59] preparation And The Fool is said unto
[5:01] the wise give us of your oil for our
[5:03] lamps are gone out and the wise answered
[5:06] saying not so lest they be not enough
[5:08] for us and you but go we rather to them
[5:11] that sell and buy for yourselves so note
[5:14] that there's not a shortage of oil
[5:16] oil is freely available but they need to
[5:19] go to the right source to get it
[5:23] amen
[5:24] and while they went to buy the
[5:27] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[5:29] went in with him to the marriage and the
[5:31] door was shut amen
[5:35] that sounds as final as Genesis 7. yes
[5:41] put up Genesis 7 16. amen let's just
[5:44] cross reference this
[5:47] the door was shut you know what this is
[5:50] amen Genesis 7 16. when Noah goes into
[5:54] the Earth they went in went in male and
[5:56] female of All Flesh as God had commanded
[5:59] him and the Lord shut him in
[6:03] so what similar event now they were
[6:06] trying when the rains are coming they
[6:07] are trying to gain entry into the ark
[6:09] they can't
[6:10] because God shut him in let's continue
[6:12] reading the bridegroom shuts the door
[6:15] and afterward all came also the other
[6:17] virgin saying Lord Lord open to us hmm
[6:21] and he answered and said verily I say
[6:24] unto you I know you're not watch
[6:26] therefore for you know neither the day
[6:28] nor the hour wherein the son of man
[6:31] cometh pay attention to them
[6:34] he is talking about a specific Ministry
[6:36] because we know he comes as
[6:40] son of man amen Son of God
[6:43] son of David
[6:45] so in the current time when he is
[6:47] speaking he's speaking in the office of
[6:49] Son of Man
[6:50] a prophet
[6:52] he's going to go away and it's going to
[6:54] become the age of Son of God the Holy
[6:57] Spirit
[6:58] but in between Son of God and Son of
[7:01] David he comes back as son of man amen
[7:04] so notice that he's saying you know not
[7:06] the day nor the hour away and the son of
[7:09] man cometh
[7:11] okay you may be seated God bless you
[7:13] amen
[7:16] so what are we noticing here they are
[7:18] called
[7:22] amen when were they called
[7:26] amen they were called under a specific
[7:29] Ministry when I'm saying they were
[7:31] called we were called
[7:33] the wisest of virgins were called Amen
[7:36] to Revelation 19 and 9 says
[7:39] right blessed are they which are called
[7:41] unto the married supper of the Lamb
[7:44] and he's saying unto me these are the
[7:47] true sayings of God
[7:51] okay
[7:52] we find here
[7:56] that as civilization has traveled with
[7:59] the Sun from east to the West so as Sin
[8:02] traveled with civilization
[8:06] every thought of man is continually evil
[8:08] it's just like the days of Noah
[8:12] amen till it grieved God that he even
[8:14] made man
[8:17] he said I will destroy man from the face
[8:19] of the Earth
[8:21] and the prophet says we've come back to
[8:23] that time again
[8:25] if we know what the condition of the
[8:28] world and what it's going through right
[8:29] now
[8:31] the people that run the world the world
[8:33] leaders
[8:35] know that it's time for the end
[8:40] why are they pushing this great agenda
[8:42] you know right now top 27 is taking
[8:45] place
[8:46] it's climate talks they're kicked off in
[8:49] Egypt and it's going on for 12 days
[8:52] world leaders climate scientists
[8:55] negotiators activists will take part in
[8:59] this great Gathering to talk about the
[9:01] planet's future
[9:05] amen when we have a confidence that the
[9:08] the safety of the plan of the earth is
[9:11] not in the hands of man
[9:14] Peter describes us when the Lord will
[9:16] destroy the Earth or burn it up
[9:19] and renovate the Earth
[9:21] amen
[9:22] they are trying to save what they have
[9:25] already destroyed
[9:27] right amen
[9:29] amen let's just read this brother Caleb
[9:31] while we're there let's go to Revelation
[9:33] 8 11 and 18 and show you in scripture
[9:36] what is currently happening
[9:39] amen
[9:41] it says here Revelation 8 11 and 18 and
[9:44] the nations were angry for thy wrathis
[9:47] come
[9:48] and the time of the Dead that they
[9:50] should be judged okay let's just take
[9:52] the two things
[9:54] are the Nations angry
[9:58] is his wrath come Revelation 10 is a
[10:01] time of
[10:02] investigating judgment right because
[10:05] amateur tribulation has set in
[10:09] making way for the Great Tribulation so
[10:12] his wrath is come
[10:13] and the time of the Dead isn't about the
[10:16] time for the dead in Christ to rise amen
[10:19] that they should be judged that they
[10:21] should be now watch learn from the
[10:23] scripture is so packed if you ever want
[10:25] to know if they reward they ended out
[10:27] here it is that they should give reward
[10:30] unto their zip for servants and the
[10:32] prophets amen you remember the prophet's
[10:35] Vision dream
[10:37] he was given rewards amen yes it
[10:39] confirmed in Scripture
[10:41] reward given to the servants
[10:44] the prophets and to the Saints amen so
[10:48] there is a time of Rewards right and
[10:51] also to them that fear thy name
[10:54] small and great and here's judgment and
[10:57] is destroying them which destroy
[11:01] the Earth
[11:03] so in that little sentence there the
[11:05] Bible is telling us that there'll come a
[11:07] time upon the Earth where man in the
[11:10] pursuit of Technology
[11:12] logical advancement
[11:15] would end up destroying themselves amen
[11:18] there's a reason there's an energy
[11:20] crisis right now is because they are
[11:23] trying to get off cold
[11:26] they can continue like that but they are
[11:29] saying that type of generating that type
[11:31] of energy is destroying the planet
[11:35] so they want clean energy
[11:38] that is why they don't want this fuel
[11:40] they want clean energy and they're going
[11:42] into fracking and fossil fuels and all
[11:45] of these things
[11:46] amen they don't want the old way of
[11:48] doing things
[11:50] because they are saying that is the
[11:52] cause of why the Earth is being
[11:55] destroyed they're talking about climate
[11:57] change they're talking about the ice
[12:00] caps melting they're talking about
[12:01] increasing temperatures rising sea
[12:03] levels
[12:05] but they don't know
[12:08] they are thinking is their doings they
[12:12] don't know it's the wrath of God being
[12:13] poured out upon the Earth
[12:16] because they don't believe in the vials
[12:18] they don't believe in their trumpets
[12:21] amen
[12:24] so man it is futility is trying to save
[12:27] himself so the Bible is telling us
[12:29] there's a group of people that are
[12:31] destroying the Earth
[12:33] and God is going to destroy them
[12:35] why why would God be angry with man that
[12:39] is destroying the Earth because
[12:41] God made man as the guardian over the
[12:45] Earth
[12:46] he made him Steward over the Earth yes
[12:48] because when God made man in Genesis 1
[12:51] man was in his Spirit form in Ethiopian
[12:54] body and in this form he could not till
[12:57] the ground
[12:59] so in Genesis 2 verse 5 the Bible tells
[13:03] us there was not a man to till the
[13:06] ground and in verse 7 it says the Lord
[13:09] God formed man of the Dust of the ground
[13:11] and breathed into his nostrils the
[13:14] breath of life and Man became a living
[13:17] soul
[13:19] and the Lord God planted a garden
[13:21] Eastwood in Eden and there he put the
[13:24] man whom he formed
[13:26] right so man would become the guardian
[13:29] of the earth his role was supposed to be
[13:32] a caretaker of the Earth
[13:34] and subdue and Rule and control
[13:37] everything on the Earth
[13:38] Earth was man's domain and heaven was
[13:41] God's domain
[13:43] amen so we find this cop 27
[13:46] now there's a very strange thing
[13:48] happening and it's going to happen on
[13:50] Sunday
[13:53] in compliance with the message of Pope
[13:56] Francis
[13:57] the world leaders are gathering at Mount
[13:59] Sinai
[14:01] what is Mount Sinai that received the
[14:04] Ten Commandments
[14:07] so here's what they're doing world
[14:09] leaders are going to be gathering on
[14:11] Mount Sinai to put forward prophetic
[14:14] interreligious call to action 10
[14:18] Universal Commandments
[14:23] now
[14:25] yeah
[14:26] we preachers over the years Pastor
[14:28] Ronnie labeled over the years and you
[14:30] know the pro you read the seals and all
[14:31] of these things we don't need to go back
[14:34] and now
[14:36] let's say instill again how the end of
[14:40] time is going to be and what the pope is
[14:42] going to do we know what he's going to
[14:44] do we can spend the next hour or so just
[14:47] trying to show you all those quotes but
[14:49] you already know these things right and
[14:51] now he's going to form a one world
[14:53] religion
[14:54] and unite all religions
[14:58] do you know he's already done it that's
[15:00] right in September
[15:02] they met for the final time
[15:05] and the final document
[15:08] if you read that document
[15:11] you'll be amazed that they have already
[15:14] set into motion the laws
[15:18] that will be implemented
[15:21] he's saying that no one religion
[15:24] should prosely light and declare that
[15:26] there is the only true way
[15:28] now pay attention because the beginning
[15:31] of the Gentile dispensation is the same
[15:33] as the ending
[15:35] amen when was the law passed
[15:38] Daniel must not pray
[15:40] while he's still at religious freedom
[15:44] he could still pray
[15:46] so laws right now are being passed
[15:50] while we still have our liberties
[15:53] and while we are worshiping
[15:56] behind closed doors
[15:58] they are signing yes
[16:00] and you see there head of the Anglican
[16:03] Church head of the Muslim faith hello
[16:05] Buddhist Faith all religion everything
[16:08] the prophet laid out in the seals is
[16:10] coming past what forward
[16:14] we are at the end of time when he said
[16:17] that this great economical move that's
[16:19] being formed now will be set up that
[16:21] image is already been set up now amen we
[16:24] have signed the final document
[16:26] the laws that the persecution will be
[16:30] set upon the people have already been
[16:32] detailed and they've already readied out
[16:35] and you read and you watch how they're
[16:37] commanding World governments and telling
[16:39] them fall in line with this do this do
[16:41] this implement this
[16:44] and then the spirit tell us that they
[16:46] cannot unite the world through politics
[16:48] so they will do it through religion amen
[16:51] amen so right now on Sunday we are going
[16:55] what are they doing they are playing God
[17:00] because they know God took Moses up to
[17:03] Mount Sinai
[17:04] and he gave him the Ten Commandments not
[17:06] for the whole world not for all the
[17:09] religions but for the chosen people of
[17:11] God Amen to follow this those Ten
[17:14] Commandments amen
[17:16] now they have formed a one-word religion
[17:19] the First Act is to go to Mount Sinai
[17:22] and they are calling it Ten Commandments
[17:26] or ten Universal principles for climate
[17:29] Justice
[17:31] they are trying to recreate the Ten
[17:33] Commandments that Moses received from
[17:35] God from this very same Mountain
[17:38] thousands of years ago
[17:43] but we had another Prophet go up to
[17:46] mount Sunset and he received a word that
[17:49] revealed all of their schemes and what
[17:51] they're going to do yes amen amen we
[17:55] have received Supernatural instruction
[17:58] from another prophet
[18:01] amen hallelujah so we are at the end of
[18:04] times Church
[18:07] right now and
[18:10] that was the that signing that they had
[18:13] funny enough was their seventh Congress
[18:18] amen if numbers mean anything to you
[18:21] that was their seventh Congress
[18:24] so we're living at the end of the
[18:26] seventh Church age
[18:27] leadership Church age and at the seventh
[18:30] Congress they signed the final document
[18:35] please go and watch that if you can
[18:38] so we know that the Lord Jesus Christ
[18:40] comes three times
[18:42] he comes to redeem his bride
[18:44] watch now
[18:46] the pattern of Jesus Christ is always
[18:48] the first time he comes he comes to
[18:50] rescue people he comes to redeem man
[18:55] amen didn't he do that in the Garden of
[18:57] Eden
[18:59] the first time he comes he comes rushing
[19:02] into the garden
[19:03] to redeem Fallen Adam and Eve
[19:08] amen
[19:09] but the next time so there's a time of
[19:12] redemption under the time of
[19:14] intercession
[19:17] amen
[19:19] one time no Noah could open their
[19:22] meetings and preach
[19:25] let this floods coming this rain coming
[19:27] I'm building an eye getting to the Ark
[19:29] of Safety
[19:30] amen there is a time for that Ministry
[19:33] but when the doors are shut
[19:37] you can't do anything yes
[19:40] there's a time when Abraham can go down
[19:43] and rescue lot physically do it
[19:46] but there's a Time
[19:48] when you can't go down and rescue a lot
[19:51] the second time
[19:53] so the second time is a time of
[19:55] intercession
[19:57] I'm trying to show you that the bride
[19:59] has moved
[20:02] from when Jesus was in the midst of
[20:04] seven golden candlesticks
[20:06] because in Revelation 2 he's in the
[20:09] midst of
[20:10] seven golden candlesticks he's in the
[20:13] midst of the church ages right right
[20:16] where is he now he's moved from that
[20:20] intercessory role because we find in
[20:23] Revelation 5 he's coming out
[20:26] of that intercessory role
[20:29] everybody agreed brother Branham says in
[20:31] the breach message he is coming out of
[20:33] the sanctuary in Revelation 5 to take
[20:35] the book
[20:36] Amen to do the claiming work to the
[20:39] names that were found in the book
[20:42] right in Revelation 5 he does that
[20:44] Revelation 6 he breaks the symbols of
[20:47] those seals Revelation 10 he comes down
[20:51] with that open book
[20:56] I said all of that to tie it up
[20:59] to behold the bridegroom cometh amen and
[21:03] show you that when the bridegroom is
[21:05] coming
[21:07] all seven Church ages oh sorry all seven
[21:10] Church age Messengers would have sounded
[21:12] their message yes
[21:14] so let's go through there amen so he
[21:17] comes the first time to redeem his bride
[21:18] second time to catch away his bride and
[21:21] the third time he comes with her as king
[21:23] and queen
[21:25] now we find here that the oil we know
[21:27] it's it's typing the time when they had
[21:30] limbs
[21:32] right
[21:34] I'm detailing it because some of the
[21:36] young people may not understand what
[21:38] we're talking about
[21:40] they used to carry a lamp
[21:42] you have to put oil in the lamp you're
[21:44] gonna put a wick
[21:47] okay
[21:48] so the oil was necessary to keep the
[21:52] flame of that light burning
[21:55] when the oil ran out the light went out
[21:59] amen
[22:03] so we find amen now there's so much that
[22:05] we can tie it with amen but we find the
[22:08] Wise carried oil with them and the
[22:11] foolish only had oil in their limbs
[22:14] they bought the rose at Midnight Cry and
[22:16] went out to meet the bridegroom so
[22:19] picture the scene it's midnight
[22:22] right
[22:23] it's doctors all around
[22:27] there's no light anywhere
[22:30] but in the midst of this gross Darkness
[22:33] are you tying it now with as I am
[22:36] that gross doctor shall cover the Earth
[22:38] amen cover the people
[22:40] but arise Shine for thy light has come
[22:44] amen
[22:45] Amen in the evening time it shall be
[22:48] lights at Zachariah yes amen amen
[22:52] so we find picture the same midnight
[22:56] latest seeing blackness
[22:59] complete blackout that went the Lord
[23:02] threw it up in the heavens he could only
[23:04] show six phases of the moon because the
[23:06] servant was completely blacked out
[23:09] Prophet says when I drew it on the board
[23:11] I added a little light
[23:14] but when the Lord threw it up in the
[23:16] heavens complete blackout
[23:20] so that's the scene we are in now
[23:22] amen and complete darkness and the only
[23:27] way they can navigate through the
[23:28] darkness is to rely on the lamps that
[23:31] they have
[23:36] now spiritually the only way we can
[23:40] navigate through this labels here and
[23:42] darkness is through the word that we
[23:43] have
[23:45] because Thy word is a
[23:48] lamp to my feet and then light to my
[23:51] path
[23:53] amen so the only way they can navigate
[23:56] through this Darkness is to rely on the
[23:59] lamp then you know your your lamp is
[24:01] your most important survival tool in
[24:03] that hour
[24:07] amen
[24:10] look they're making their journey to
[24:12] meet the bridegroom
[24:14] now along the way in the midst of gross
[24:16] darkness in the journey
[24:20] the foolish virgins run out of oil
[24:23] if I could break it down so that all of
[24:26] us understand
[24:27] it's like load shedding
[24:31] that's what this is modern day load
[24:33] shedding
[24:35] for the five foolish
[24:38] you know when you are sitting at home
[24:41] and the lights go out but your neighbor
[24:43] got a generator
[24:45] and you look at his house and you see it
[24:46] all litter
[24:49] or maybe you got solo energy
[24:53] that's how the foolish were looking at
[24:56] the wise
[24:57] because now in the midst of gross
[24:59] Darkness pitch Darkness
[25:02] I'm trying to explain it in the next one
[25:05] but I hope you're catching the spiritual
[25:06] amen because that's what's happening in
[25:09] the church world right now
[25:10] everywhere light is in Ocean
[25:13] but under this Darkness
[25:18] I remember the time
[25:20] when
[25:21] maybe 20 years ago brother Joshua
[25:24] Remember the Time
[25:26] when the Pastors in the denominational
[25:28] world were getting frantic they said
[25:30] we're losing
[25:31] our youth
[25:33] to the world
[25:35] so they started to change the music in
[25:38] the church and just about that time Kirk
[25:41] Franklin came up with that song Stomp
[25:43] and it sounded so much like the club
[25:45] songs
[25:47] and every Church started to play it
[25:49] you remember when stomp was going crazy
[25:53] every church and I was working at Cleves
[25:56] music at that time and people used to
[25:58] come and ask us
[26:00] they wanted to upgrade their sound
[26:02] systems put some subwoofers get the base
[26:05] going
[26:07] they asked us for lighting they were
[26:09] looking for lighting stage lighting
[26:10] starting to put disco lights into the
[26:13] church and they would I should have some
[26:15] conversations with these pastors and
[26:17] they should tell me we need to attract
[26:19] our youth
[26:25] these modern day Elvises
[26:28] that's what they've done they sold out
[26:30] the gospel
[26:32] and the youth are even worse off
[26:34] condition now
[26:36] amen they have no morals no standards
[26:40] and they don't have God
[26:43] amen
[26:44] so you see what started in that fruit
[26:47] it's only in seed form sounded like an
[26:50] idea for the for that Pastor to retain
[26:53] his members but look at it now when the
[26:55] tree is fully grown
[26:58] amen
[27:00] complete darkness all around amen so the
[27:03] foolish run out of oil so with no light
[27:06] to guide them
[27:07] through the darkness they turn to the
[27:10] wise and they asked the wise
[27:12] for some of their oil
[27:15] now what is the oil producing
[27:19] light what is light revelation
[27:22] the holy ghost that we have is giving us
[27:24] Revelation in this hour to navigate
[27:26] through every storm of life
[27:29] no matter what they throw at us we can
[27:31] navigate through it
[27:33] because of Revelation
[27:35] amen revelation of the word
[27:38] amen there's nothing that the pope can
[27:41] throw at us at the World Council of
[27:42] churches can throw at us the
[27:44] denominational work you throw at us that
[27:46] this bride will be confounded this bride
[27:48] has been well prepared for this hour
[27:51] amen we are preparing for a final
[27:53] Victory yes
[27:55] Hallelujah
[27:57] amen but when the when they come to us
[28:01] the wise the wise refuse
[28:06] because they need all the oil they can
[28:09] because they still got still some time
[28:11] journey ahead to get to the bridegroom
[28:13] follow my thought now amen
[28:17] amen
[28:20] foreign
[28:23] to be compassionate
[28:25] and charitable at that time
[28:29] amen yes
[28:32] so the wise continue on their journey
[28:34] and you'll find a separation time comes
[28:39] a separation between the wise and the
[28:42] foolish
[28:43] they go these Separate Ways
[28:45] amen
[28:47] Hallelujah
[28:49] so we find amen
[28:52] because they refused initially to take
[28:54] oil in their vessels they ran out of oil
[28:57] they refused the prophets instructions
[29:00] initially
[29:01] amen for the Caleb get up genome
[29:04] National Rivers there see if you can
[29:06] find the quote in amen Feast of the
[29:08] trumpets
[29:09] you find it in paragraph 243 there amen
[29:12] so we find here
[29:14] the oil that was needed to get to the
[29:16] bridegroom and we are still on our
[29:18] journey
[29:19] to the bridegroom not so
[29:22] so we need all the oil we cannot get
[29:26] all the reserve that we have we need to
[29:29] make sure that we are filled
[29:32] and I I want to put it this way make
[29:34] sure that we are not having load
[29:36] shedding in our lives
[29:44] we are having our own load shedding
[29:47] amen sometimes three days gone and load
[29:51] shedding no lights no word is being read
[29:54] no word is being heard
[29:56] we are having personal load sharing
[30:00] because our generators are down for
[30:03] maintenance
[30:06] amen
[30:08] so as a admonishment to the church watch
[30:11] that we are not having spiritual load
[30:13] shedding amen
[30:15] amen and sometimes you know what we
[30:18] can't get caught up in that situation
[30:20] but awaken yourself quickly and run back
[30:24] amen and check your oil check your lab
[30:27] trim it you need light in this hour to
[30:30] navigate otherwise you'll get swept up
[30:32] with this later Shield spirit amen amen
[30:35] hmm amen and believe me the devil is
[30:38] life
[30:39] the devil is coming
[30:41] he knows how to pray on your weaknesses
[30:44] amen so guard yourself amen amen he
[30:48] prayed up all the time
[30:49] amen because the David Good Devil goeth
[30:52] around like a roaring lion she
[30:54] ikh he may devour
[30:57] don't become food for the devil
[30:59] and don't say oh I got overtaken by a
[31:02] lion the Bible says he's like a roaring
[31:04] lion
[31:06] because when you're sitting there on the
[31:07] floor and you're thinking one line is
[31:09] going to eat you and Auntie's looking at
[31:10] you there
[31:12] because he's like a roaring lion
[31:14] now this ant is going to nibble at you
[31:16] slowly
[31:17] and feed on you
[31:21] you want to be eating up a mouse
[31:25] amen
[31:26] Hallelujah
[31:29] so we find amen yeah let's read this
[31:31] here the holy spirit because we are
[31:33] saying they ran out of oil and I'm
[31:35] putting this quote in to show you how
[31:37] they ran out of oil the Holy Spirit has
[31:40] been doubt Bound by these denominational
[31:42] Rivers
[31:43] for almost 2 000 years but is to be
[31:47] loose in the evening time
[31:49] by the evening time messenger so when we
[31:53] say the evening time messenger loses the
[31:55] Holy Spirit
[31:57] amen we are using this quote
[32:00] the evening time messenger loses the
[32:03] evening time message amen which releases
[32:05] an evening time anointing
[32:09] and gives us an evening time Revelation
[32:11] to light up our path
[32:14] arise and shine for thy life has come
[32:16] amen amen what light are we talking
[32:19] about amen we are talking about the
[32:22] light of the opening of the word amen
[32:25] hallelujah amen the light that came
[32:28] shining for amen under that servant
[32:31] Steel
[32:33] amen hallelujah
[32:36] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[32:38] only
[32:40] only Juliet knew when Romeo was coming
[32:46] amen
[32:48] Hallelujah
[32:49] because it was an Eden encrypted message
[32:52] amen amen going out to meet him
[32:57] Hallelujah there had to be a specific
[32:59] time now we find amen there is no Amen
[33:02] to the wise and the foolish have come to
[33:04] a separation
[33:07] I I don't
[33:08] I don't message Richard will say uh
[33:10] foolish virgins are the message
[33:13] didn't we just read now
[33:15] the foolish left the wise
[33:18] and said go find some of your own
[33:21] based on that scripture you don't
[33:24] hear
[33:26] anybody agree
[33:28] based on that scripture it doesn't
[33:30] dovetail
[33:31] with an idea that foolish virgins are in
[33:34] the message
[33:41] amen
[33:44] the Bible says they went to find oil
[33:48] so they left the wise they went to find
[33:52] their own oil
[33:53] right if you want to find out who's
[33:55] selling oil go read revelation
[33:58] there's a group that's crying out come
[34:00] by without money come by without price
[34:05] amen isn't that group crying out in
[34:07] Revelation
[34:08] so they go and trying to find that
[34:10] revelation
[34:12] Hallelujah now if you understand what
[34:16] they are asked to
[34:17] they are asked to go back
[34:20] and receive justification sanctification
[34:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[34:26] because they cannot just receive oil the
[34:28] Holy Ghost without the other two stages
[34:31] they must go through all three walks of
[34:34] Grace
[34:35] so it's taking them some time
[34:39] before they arrive back
[34:42] when they come back they find the door
[34:44] to the marriage is already closed
[34:48] now we know in that time
[34:50] something happened
[34:53] amen
[34:54] there was a prophet messenger who came
[34:56] in that time
[35:01] Hallelujah
[35:03] and he introduced us to our Isaac
[35:08] amen
[35:09] and the wedding ceremony has been
[35:12] performed
[35:16] and he has taken this bride to be his
[35:19] wife
[35:21] and they went into the marriage
[35:26] amen
[35:28] not the married sapna the Bible says
[35:31] they went into the marriage
[35:33] and the door was shut
[35:35] amen so the prophet says while the five
[35:38] virgins went into the marriage the five
[35:41] that remained outside were left
[35:43] to the Great Tribulation
[35:46] this is what will happen to all who are
[35:48] not going to go up in the rapture
[35:50] that is what will come upon the eyelids
[35:53] and our daughters
[35:54] amen
[35:56] Hallelujah
[36:03] so we find that word virgin amen that
[36:05] word virgin is Keen a chaste woman
[36:08] that's what we are amen clean from every
[36:11] denominational idea
[36:13] amen hallelujah we are clothed with the
[36:16] garments of the word of God the wise
[36:18] virgin is not deceived
[36:20] now there's been a change in the
[36:22] ministry like I told you because now
[36:24] she's no longer walking in the Starlight
[36:29] because when the bridegroom cometh who
[36:32] is he
[36:33] the s-o-n light
[36:37] because when he comes what the Bible
[36:39] says he took it into the marriage
[36:42] so she is now in the presence of the
[36:44] great satellite amen amen hallelujah and
[36:48] that's right in line amen with what the
[36:51] prophet is preaching he takes us from an
[36:53] Easter seal to it is the rising of the
[36:56] Sun
[36:58] watch now
[37:00] so there's been a change in the light
[37:02] that the bride has been walking in
[37:05] one stage we walked under
[37:09] light
[37:10] but now we are walking under sunlight
[37:14] and that is why we are walking amen
[37:17] under Luke 17 30 lives
[37:21] remember what Jesus said now
[37:24] today
[37:25] he said let's put it up Matthew 25 verse
[37:28] 13. he says watch therefore for you know
[37:32] neither the day nor the hour wearing the
[37:35] son of man cometh
[37:38] what is Son of Man
[37:40] God in a prophet
[37:44] God in a prophetic office
[37:47] brother Branham was a son of man
[37:49] revealing the son of man
[37:52] amen
[37:54] Hallelujah
[37:55] who was given the king's sword
[38:00] amen so understand that that is now so
[38:03] he's telling you you know not not the
[38:06] hour wearing Luke 17 will be fulfilled
[38:09] is that what he's saying let's read Luke
[38:12] 17.
[38:14] Luke 17 26 as it was in the days of Noah
[38:18] so shall it be in the days of the son of
[38:21] man
[38:22] this son of man again
[38:24] they didn't eat drink they married wives
[38:27] they were given in marriage until the
[38:29] day Noah entered the Earth the flood
[38:31] came and destroyed them all likewise
[38:34] also as it was in the days of lot they
[38:36] did eat they drank they bought they sold
[38:39] they planted and build it but in the
[38:41] same day that lot went out of Sodom it
[38:44] rained fire and Brookstone from heaven
[38:46] and destroyed them all
[38:52] even thus shall it be in the day when
[38:54] the son of man is revealed now watch if
[38:57] you pay close attention to Luke 17
[39:00] is describing the end of the foolish
[39:03] version
[39:05] but there's a hidden mystery about the
[39:07] wise virgin in there
[39:11] amen because Noah found Grace in the
[39:14] eyes of the Lord
[39:16] and he was spared him and his family
[39:20] so even as in the days of lot there's a
[39:24] hidden Mystery because Abraham and Sarah
[39:27] are having a body change at that time
[39:32] [Music]
[39:34] amen amen
[39:36] you can actually time when Abraham and
[39:39] Sarah had that body changed
[39:44] because before that first born Falls
[39:48] this bride will have a body change
[39:51] so before fire and brimstone Came Upon
[39:54] Sodom that day
[39:56] just before that Sarah and Abraham had a
[40:00] body change
[40:05] amen
[40:07] so he tells you that Luke 17 30 even
[40:10] that shall it be in the day when the son
[40:12] of man is revealed
[40:15] amen
[40:18] so there was a time amen when
[40:22] they came a separation at this end time
[40:25] we find it happened at the seventh watch
[40:27] we find also Noah is called into the Ark
[40:31] in the seventh chapter
[40:34] all typing the end time
[40:37] Noah is called into the app and taken
[40:39] into a new world in that seventh chapter
[40:42] right
[40:45] so yeah
[40:46] we find amen another time of chaos
[40:49] another time of Blackness and darkness
[40:52] and Gloom came over the disciples
[40:54] because Jesus was crucified
[40:57] the church was thrown into chaos
[41:00] the disciples are in hiding
[41:03] and you're very early in the morning the
[41:05] first day of the week they come to the
[41:07] simple cup at the rising of the Sun
[41:15] but everything was going to change from
[41:17] that point on
[41:21] because this was the beginning of the
[41:24] Eighth Day
[41:27] Sunday is the first day of the week
[41:29] but it's also termed as the Eighth Day
[41:34] amen this was the beginning of the
[41:36] Eighth Day and The Eighth Day represents
[41:39] what age the bright age
[41:42] amen
[41:46] we're going back to the beginning amen
[41:49] beginning for the bright age amen before
[41:52] the falling away took place and the
[41:54] start of the seven Church ages amen
[41:56] where only the candle light would shine
[41:59] amen
[42:01] but right now when they're standing in
[42:04] the presence of their
[42:05] Risen Sun
[42:08] amen now I want you to know that the
[42:11] rising of the sun and the angel
[42:13] descending at that morning to take away
[42:17] the stone was not to release Jesus from
[42:20] the tomb
[42:21] Jesus wasn't risen and trapped in that
[42:23] tomb
[42:26] and calling for the angels to take me
[42:28] out of this tomb
[42:29] remember Jesus is in a glorified body he
[42:33] can pass through walls yes but it's a
[42:36] type for the end time
[42:38] revelation 10. when the mighty Angel
[42:41] descends
[42:44] amen
[42:46] the rising of the Sun in this age amen
[42:48] because we are not in the candle light
[42:50] of the church ages anymore we are living
[42:52] in the bright age when the sun is risen
[42:55] after seven long nights of church ages
[43:00] when the sun comes up you don't need
[43:02] Candlelight anymore
[43:05] amen so the two women at the dawn of the
[43:08] Eighth Day at the rising of the Sun
[43:10] and there's a great earthquake and a
[43:12] descending angel that breaks the seal
[43:15] and rolls back to Stone to reveal to
[43:18] them Christ the Risen Sun
[43:22] now the prophet says there was a dual
[43:24] Sunrise the sun and the son right amen
[43:27] so he says when this Angel roll back a
[43:30] stone that held the Revelation that
[43:32] Jesus was risen now Mary the two Marys
[43:35] didn't know that Jesus was risen
[43:38] the stone was rolled away to bring to
[43:41] them the Revelation that Jesus is not
[43:43] dead but he's alive
[43:45] [Music]
[43:46] was to expose the Risen Christ
[43:49] amen and we said he was in a glorified
[43:52] body he could walk towards did not need
[43:54] the angel to roll away the stone but the
[43:57] mighty Angel who descended and told open
[43:59] the seal is to reveal to us that there
[44:02] is now a living what was the seals to do
[44:07] to reveal this end time seal was taken
[44:10] away to reveal that there is a living
[44:12] resurrected bride that just as how the
[44:16] head Rose about two thousand years ago
[44:18] now the body has risen
[44:21] amen amen doesn't he come to empower the
[44:26] body would the title deed
[44:29] so when he takes away the seal
[44:31] is revealing to there's John the Risen
[44:34] body
[44:36] take back the title deed to the Earth
[44:40] amen so he's revealing the living
[44:43] resurrected bride that amen hallelujah
[44:46] so at the rising of the sun she bursts
[44:49] forth into life amen so in order for us
[44:52] to come out of a denominational tomb
[44:54] amen and walk amen
[44:57] that we were once walking in Candlelight
[44:59] but we had to come out of the
[45:01] denominational tomb amen so the angel
[45:03] must break the seal on your life and
[45:05] reveal who you are who you are amen that
[45:08] you are Eternal as God is eternal
[45:10] revealed to you that your name is in the
[45:13] book what is he doing he's taking away
[45:15] the seal
[45:16] of your life
[45:18] and revealing to you your Eternal
[45:21] attributes
[45:23] thank you
[45:25] the word of this age is revealed to you
[45:27] by the Angel's message
[45:30] amen so only those that has a seal upon
[45:34] their lives
[45:36] and that seal must be broken
[45:38] tell you
[45:40] who your mother and father is
[45:43] amen and he said I'm not the son of
[45:45] Charles and Ella Branham
[45:48] amen
[45:50] now notices
[45:52] this event at the rising of the Sun
[45:55] was a mighty Revelation to the woman at
[45:57] that time
[45:58] and notice how it came
[46:00] when the Easter seal was broken
[46:04] now here it is in type again because we
[46:07] told you it's a son of man revealing the
[46:09] son of man
[46:10] but the Brennan preaches the Easter sea
[46:12] in 1965.
[46:15] right on the 10th of April 1965.
[46:25] then so that's in Phoenix Arizona
[46:29] then he goes back to the east
[46:32] he goes back to Jeffersonville
[46:35] and eight days later just like the story
[46:39] is preaching it is the rising of the Sun
[46:45] if you caught that it's a Time
[46:49] of the son of man being revealed amen
[46:53] 10th of April 1965 he preaches the
[46:56] Easter seal eight days later he preaches
[47:00] it is the rising of the Sun
[47:05] and in that very same message it starts
[47:08] out by telling you
[47:10] you need to turn that picture to the
[47:13] right
[47:14] first time
[47:17] I don't understand
[47:20] why so many churches still have the
[47:22] picture the other way
[47:26] because the law told the prophet you're
[47:28] looking at the picture the wrong way
[47:31] so why do you want to have the picture
[47:33] the wrong way
[47:36] some say we want to stick with the
[47:38] original the way science took it why you
[47:40] want to look at it the way science took
[47:41] it
[47:42] when the Lord is telling the prophet so
[47:45] honey you're looking at the picture the
[47:47] wrong way turn it to the right
[47:49] [Music]
[47:52] amen
[47:53] so let's tell it the right way amen
[47:56] because when you turn it the other way
[47:58] you don't see Christ
[48:01] amen
[48:02] so from that point we see there was a
[48:06] turning point now in the ministry as
[48:08] well
[48:09] because
[48:11] eight months later so moving from eight
[48:14] days it is the rising of the sun eight
[48:17] months later brother Branham is taken
[48:19] off the scene and there's a change in
[48:22] the ministry
[48:25] because Revelation 10 7 is taken off the
[48:28] scene
[48:29] and it's a time now
[48:32] for thou must prophesy again amen yes
[48:35] amen
[48:37] Hallelujah
[48:42] foreign
[48:44] [Music]
[48:50] [Music]
[48:52] so we know as we're ending now we're
[48:55] going to prepare
[48:56] keep our lamps trimmed and burning we're
[48:59] telling you all of this to tell you this
[49:01] amen let's get this in the message amen
[49:03] it says type of this that church will
[49:07] stand true in the fight
[49:11] it says don't make no difference what
[49:13] they say
[49:14] that church will stand true in the fight
[49:16] she has already proved it back Yonder
[49:19] and she'll do it again in the face of
[49:21] everything
[49:22] it's the word of God and let all
[49:25] economical movements and anything else
[49:27] be gone she is going to be there without
[49:29] spot or wrinkle that's right she'll
[49:32] stand there
[49:33] talking about now the wise virgin amen
[49:37] you can see this is Christ The Mystery
[49:39] of God revealed he's preaching this
[49:41] in 416 he says and they're going to
[49:44] bring a persecution on pretty soon
[49:48] you got it
[49:52] why why are we ending with this amen
[49:55] remember the prophet says there must be
[49:57] a squeeze
[50:00] and if you go and read that document
[50:01] that they finally sign it'll show you
[50:04] how that we cannot even preach that
[50:07] Jesus is the only way
[50:10] even the pope is saying he doesn't even
[50:13] refer to God anymore he refers to God as
[50:15] Creator creator of all and he says God
[50:19] creators are all equal
[50:22] amen
[50:25] right now he's really speaking like a
[50:27] dragon
[50:28] with subtleity though
[50:30] so he says here and they're going to
[50:32] bring a persecution on pretty soon and
[50:35] shut up all the churches you see that
[50:38] and churches like this who is not a
[50:40] denomination they'll use them for he
[50:43] stores anything
[50:44] [Music]
[50:47] and he says here and if any man goes and
[50:50] offer prayer for anybody else that don't
[50:52] belong to the economical movement will
[50:55] be shot on the spot
[50:57] it's all ready we got that
[51:03] [Music]
[51:05] a bitter religious persecution
[51:09] we're nearing that time
[51:11] he says you remember church that we're
[51:13] living in the best day that you'll ever
[51:16] will live in right now until Jesus come
[51:22] you got this
[51:24] say living in the best day that you ever
[51:26] will live in
[51:30] he says you remember Church you're
[51:32] living in the best day that you ever
[51:34] will live in right now until Jesus come
[51:37] it shall rapidly get better and better
[51:44] [Music]
[51:47] what does he say
[51:48] he will rapidly get worse and worse
[51:51] now
[51:52] isn't that exactly what's happening
[51:55] we can hardly keep up with how was Ben
[51:57] is getting
[51:59] rapidly it's getting worse and worse
[52:02] the world is crying out
[52:05] in fact right now they elected little
[52:07] boys whistling through the graveyard
[52:10] you watch after this U.S election
[52:11] midterm they've been
[52:13] trying to keep our faces and appearances
[52:15] try to keep the economy a bit stable
[52:18] let this midterm finish
[52:21] you'll see the true effects of it
[52:25] amen
[52:27] he says we're coming into a religious
[52:29] persecution with the same things they
[52:31] did in Pagan Rome many years ago for it
[52:34] does save the Lord
[52:38] [Music]
[52:41] amen
[52:45] [Music]
[52:50] yeah again I want to say this
[52:52] because some people still have questions
[52:54] what is the mark of the beast in
[52:55] question and answers
[52:57] paragraph 26 question and answers you'll
[53:00] see that in 1959
[53:02] he says the mark of the beast is on
[53:05] today
[53:06] and the Seal of God is the Holy Spirit
[53:10] now hear this very clearly because
[53:12] people have always questioned what is
[53:15] the mark of the beast
[53:19] right
[53:21] so he's telling you the mark of the
[53:22] beast is on today the Seal of God is the
[53:26] Holy Spirit
[53:26] [Music]
[53:28] to reject it that means to reject the
[53:30] Holy Ghost to reject it is the mark of
[53:33] the beast
[53:37] right so you can be sitting in church
[53:41] reject the Holy Ghost and you can be
[53:43] receiving the mark of the beast right
[53:45] here
[53:49] but you're waiting for them to come to
[53:51] the church
[53:52] you're waiting therefore to come put a
[53:54] tattoo you're waiting for him to come
[53:56] with a permanent Mark and write on your
[53:57] head
[53:59] but he says yes it sure to reject it
[54:03] is the mark of the beast
[54:06] amen
[54:12] just continue reading there amen
[54:17] he says ever who sees the holy ghost
[54:20] that you're supposed to receive it and
[54:22] don't do it
[54:24] that's the same with the wise and
[54:25] foolish now
[54:27] he didn't do it right automatically you
[54:30] take the mark of the beast now you see
[54:32] the hidden story that's not being told
[54:33] in that's terrible
[54:37] when they ran out of oil they didn't
[54:39] have the Holy Ghost when they went away
[54:41] they received the mark of the beast
[54:43] that's why when they came back because
[54:46] they were mocked already Christ couldn't
[54:48] open up the door
[54:50] it was sealed
[54:52] right
[54:55] he says you're supposed to receive it
[54:57] you didn't automatically you take the
[54:59] mark of the beast because there's only
[55:01] two classes to exist all that didn't
[55:04] have the Seal of God had the mark of the
[55:06] beast so to receive the Seal of God is
[55:09] to receive the Holy Ghost to reject it
[55:11] is to have the mark of the beast there's
[55:13] the whole thing that's exactly right
[55:18] thank you
[55:28] foreign
[55:31] [Music]
[55:41] let's just take this last quote amen I
[55:45] will close with this
[55:52] it's handwriting on the wall 1956.
[55:56] the handwriting on the wall 1956 amen
[55:58] paragraph
[56:00] 89 he says I want you to notice the
[56:04] beginning of the Gentiles when God dealt
[56:07] with them they got OT in their heart and
[56:09] forced every man to worship the image of
[56:11] a holy man
[56:13] and the Gentile age was issued in with
[56:15] that it will go out in the same way
[56:19] a boycott of the mark of the beast that
[56:22] will force people to worship images and
[56:25] to do the thing that they've been taught
[56:26] that was contrary to the word of God
[56:29] and brother it'll be so slick and Sly
[56:31] until it will deceive the very elective
[56:34] possible
[56:36] so you better purpose in your heart
[56:38] tonight to be filled with God's holy
[56:40] spirit
[56:42] that you'll be able to discern the right
[56:45] and wrong
[56:46] when the proclamation is issued amen
[56:50] amen
[56:51] now I ask you what Proclamation is that
[56:58] I think we have just witnessed it
[57:01] because they've already written it down
[57:06] they're going back now to Mount Sinai on
[57:08] Sunday
[57:09] to create their own Ten Commandments
[57:14] you don't believe me
[57:17] you're good on Google
[57:20] [Music]
[57:21] amen Sunday they're going to do it
[57:24] while you are gathered here on Sunday
[57:26] they're gonna have a religious
[57:28] experience on Mount Sinai
[57:31] and they're going to create their Ten
[57:32] Commandments
[57:35] and don't think because Who's involved
[57:38] with cop 27 the United Nations
[57:41] and all the world religious leaders that
[57:43] have come from the summit of the Pope
[57:47] they're saying it's time the time for
[57:49] talking is over
[57:52] right the pope has already got 10
[57:55] climate Commandments you can read that
[57:58] he's already got it out
[58:04] so the Pope that man of sin you can see
[58:07] how he's working
[58:10] amen
[58:11] and he is working through satility
[58:16] how many of you can go and Unite
[58:19] you ever tried talking to a Muslim man
[58:21] and trying to have fellowship with him
[58:24] how did this guy get it right
[58:27] he got the biggest Imam in the Muslim
[58:30] world
[58:31] to sign a document that they all worship
[58:34] one God
[58:36] he's got Jewish people he's got Hindus
[58:39] he's got Buddhist
[58:41] he's got the anglicans he's got the
[58:43] Pentecostal he's got everyone there
[58:45] how did he do it
[58:49] amen
[58:51] because he's anointed to do it
[58:54] the same way you are anointed for your
[58:56] part
[58:57] he's anointed for his part
[59:00] I tell you go here tomorrow and try and
[59:02] get this priest from this Temple this
[59:04] Imam from this mosque
[59:06] and see what they won't come join me too
[59:10] because you are not anointed for that
[59:15] amen but where
[59:18] the caucuses amen you can gather Eagles
[59:21] together amen they'll come Eagles will
[59:25] come because of the word amen so even as
[59:28] we are preparing for this time amen
[59:30] the sun light is here
[59:35] Luke 17 30 is here the son of man is
[59:38] being revealed now once he was revealed
[59:41] through a son of man now he's being
[59:43] revealed to a many member body

[59:49] the earth to light up the word for your
[59:50] age

[1:00:39] amen and then from Monday to Saturday
[1:00:42] it's a blackout
[1:00:46] let's examine Our Lives because the only
[1:00:49] person who can fix it is you the prophet
[1:00:52] says to reject the Holy Ghost when the
[1:00:54] Holy Ghost is speaking to you right now
[1:00:55] is to receive the mark of the beast
