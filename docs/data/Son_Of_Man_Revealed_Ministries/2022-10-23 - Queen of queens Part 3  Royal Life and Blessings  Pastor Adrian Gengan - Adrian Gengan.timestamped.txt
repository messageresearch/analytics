[2:31] day fast approaching
[2:32] you know if we look around things are
[2:34] happening so rapidly
[2:36] you can hardly keep up with the news if
[2:38] you are reading it Through The Eyes of
[2:40] the message because this is exciting you
[2:42] and that's exciting and it's falling
[2:44] into place and the seals are coming
[2:46] alive

[2:49] telling

[2:54] and we look forward to that time amen
[2:56] when the Lord will call us away amen
[2:59] Hallelujah you're just going to move the

[3:03] Amen to accommodate our brother uh
[3:05] subation was going away for three days
[3:07] of training he didn't want to miss the
[3:09] communion service so amen
[3:12] let's just move it to the next week
[3:14] Wednesday amen so this morning amen will
[3:17] speak on queen of queens or three
[3:21] will speak on Royal life and blessings
[3:24] amen
[3:25] Royal life and blessings let's turn to
[3:28] our scripture
[3:30] Galatians chapter 3 and verse 6.
[3:34] somebody told me the other day I've
[3:36] never ever heard a title of queen of
[3:38] Queens
[3:39] I said yes you'll never hear of it
[3:41] because you got to be in it to know who
[3:44] you are amen
[3:47] [Music]
[3:50] Galatians chapter 3 and verse 6 reads
[3:52] even as Abraham believed God and it was
[3:56] a counter to him for righteousness
[3:59] knowing therefore that they which are
[4:02] Faith the same are the children of
[4:04] Abraham
[4:05] and the scripture foreseeing that God
[4:08] would justify the Eden through faith
[4:11] isn't that us God Justified us through
[4:15] faith preached before the gospel unto
[4:18] Abraham saying indeed shall All Nations
[4:21] be blessed
[4:24] what an inheritance amen and when he
[4:27] said thou must prophesy again he's again
[4:29] telling the people that it through us
[4:32] the nations of the world will be blessed
[4:34] once again
[4:37] so then they would be be afraid are
[4:41] blessed with faithful Abraham
[4:44] so all Abraham's blessings are ours
[4:47] through the Royal Seed of Abraham amen
[4:51] now let's turn to Ephesians 1 and verse
[4:53] 3. remember our topic is the Royal life
[4:55] and blessings
[4:57] amen so Ephesians 1 and 3 says
[5:01] blessed be the God and father of our
[5:03] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[5:06] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[5:10] places in Christ
[5:14] we have all spiritual blessings and we
[5:18] are not just here on the Earth we are
[5:20] seated together with him in Heavenly
[5:22] places
[5:24] amen may the Lord have blessings to the
[5:26] reading of his word you may be seated
[5:29] now just about a quarter of the prophet
[5:31] regarding the message of the hour that
[5:34] we have received now the message is
[5:36] really a sacred trust to you and I
[5:39] and we have got to watch how we handle
[5:41] the message
[5:42] our attitude to the message
[5:45] amen this is really gold given to us
[5:49] if gold is the most precious metal
[5:52] it's it seems uh bad to compare to
[5:55] something material like that but just to
[5:57] give it value
[5:59] this ought to be more than life to us
[6:02] and listen what the prophet says now he
[6:04] said God demands respects
[6:07] God sends his message you listen to it
[6:10] and you reverence it
[6:14] don't care if they call it a bunch of
[6:16] Holy Rollers or whatever they call it
[6:18] let the world do what they want but you
[6:22] give respects
[6:24] amen now we find the more that that we
[6:28] read the message
[6:30] now why why were you encouraging you to
[6:32] read the message I know that you are all
[6:34] listening to the tapes I know that you
[6:36] are reading the messages that when the
[6:38] messages are coming forth week after
[6:40] week
[6:41] you begin to enjoy the messages more
[6:43] amen you'll know exactly where the
[6:45] ministry is preaching out of and you
[6:48] begin to amend the word amen now our
[6:51] lives mustn't be dry
[6:53] we must enrich ourselves with the word
[6:55] of God when we enrich ourselves with the
[6:58] word of God we find ourselves being
[6:59] washed By the Waters of the world we
[7:02] find ourselves being changed we'll find
[7:05] ourselves becoming more anointed
[7:08] we find ourselves being amen delivered
[7:11] of demon spirit because the preaching of
[7:13] the word cast out demon spirits
[7:17] we'll find ourselves being built up by
[7:19] faith because Faith cometh by the
[7:21] hearing of the word the word of God Amen
[7:25] we find that we are the anointed voice
[7:28] for the age
[7:29] we we want the original anointing the
[7:32] original anointing 48 came by the
[7:35] seventh angel and because we received
[7:38] this message amen hallelujah we are now
[7:41] a continuation of that same anointing
[7:44] that same anointing of that flying eagle
[7:46] that's flying through the land
[7:49] amen and what do we have with us we are
[7:53] carrying the blood of Jesus Christ and
[7:55] we are sprinkling the blood of Jesus
[7:57] Christ all across the Earth saying to us
[8:01] whoever will let him come and drink
[8:03] freely
[8:04] amen we are the anointed one for the age
[8:07] and what a prophet messenger we have
[8:10] I tell you you can take all the gifted
[8:13] men of the Earth but what a anointed
[8:15] Prophet messenger we had what a humble
[8:18] anointed messenger of God who stayed
[8:21] faithful to the call of God
[8:23] amen and whose message we are still
[8:26] benefiting from amen this morning amen I
[8:29] believe we are to give you reverence to
[8:31] the message of the hour I believe we
[8:34] ought to appreciate the message of the
[8:35] hour
[8:36] amen this is the Royal life we have been
[8:39] called unto amen amen amen hallelujah
[8:42] and you know people in the world are so
[8:44] unaware that God sent this message
[8:47] so unaware that he sent it by the mighty
[8:49] angel of Revelation 10. to the seventh
[8:53] angel now the prophet said that this
[8:56] messenger of Revelation 10 is on Earth
[8:58] at the time of the coming of the mighty
[9:01] angel
[9:02] yeah yes amen
[9:04] and yeah he was standing on the earth
[9:07] when this Mighty angel came down from
[9:10] heaven
[9:11] and if I had to equate it to something
[9:13] it's like the captain of the horse who
[9:16] ascended amen who descended for to set
[9:19] the battle in the rain when Joshua Was
[9:22] preparing to take over that City
[9:26] now this bride is preparing to take all
[9:29] the New Jerusalem and the mighty Angel
[9:32] has come down to set the battle in the
[9:35] rain
[9:36] amen and and we find amen the seventh
[9:40] angel that this message came to reveal
[9:43] the mystery of God
[9:45] and when that initial mystery of God was
[9:48] revealed when we knew who God is
[9:52] every other Revelation broke through
[9:54] amen
[9:56] you cannot know of God Amen if we don't
[9:59] know our God we cannot understand him we
[10:01] cannot understand his ways but because
[10:03] we understand who God is
[10:06] and that's a blessed Revelation given to
[10:09] us amen I tell you there's nobody else
[10:13] upon the face of the Earth who's living
[10:15] a royal life who knows their God
[10:18] people are confused they don't know God
[10:21] amen the denominational world is
[10:24] believing in the Trinity of Gods
[10:26] even the Oneness do not have a true
[10:28] revelation of the godhead
[10:31] the Jehovah's Witnesses do not have a
[10:34] true revelation
[10:36] amen the Hindu man the Muslim man the
[10:39] Buddha amen take all the religions of
[10:42] the world
[10:43] nobody is living a royal life who has
[10:46] the knowledge of the one true Living God
[10:48] Amen
[10:49] pride is living a royal life amen
[10:52] because like Daniel said of people who
[10:56] knows that God shall do great exploits
[11:00] I asked you to consider that again
[11:02] you are the only people on the face of
[11:04] the Earth who understand the revelation
[11:07] of God
[11:10] and that is no light thing
[11:13] that's a revelation given to us
[11:16] amen and to you it is given to
[11:19] understand the mysteries of the Kingdom
[11:21] amen amen the disciples had that
[11:25] revelation
[11:26] they knew who this was
[11:28] yes amen let's go to John chapter 14.
[11:31] it's not you in the notes amen let's go
[11:34] to John chapter 14. I just want to go
[11:36] there quick while the spirit brings us
[11:37] to mind amen hallelujah
[11:40] while you're turning their amen so we
[11:42] have been privileged to have this most
[11:44] glorious message
[11:46] a message straight from the portals of
[11:48] Heaven brought down to the Earth by God
[11:51] almighty
[11:54] what a wonderful opportunity we have
[11:56] church
[11:57] to be United with Christ
[11:59] amen now this is now Jesus talking to
[12:03] the disciples right
[12:05] he says you believe in God believe also
[12:07] in me
[12:08] in my father's house are many mansions
[12:10] if it were not so I would have told you
[12:12] I go to prepare a place for you now you
[12:15] know Jesus is talking about bodies there
[12:16] right we're not talking about this I
[12:18] just want to get to a place let's move
[12:19] to the next verse next
[12:23] let's go down I'll tell you when to
[12:24] start
[12:26] okay let's go back one
[12:29] Jesus said to them I am the way the
[12:32] truth
[12:33] and the life no man covered unto the
[12:35] father but by me now watch the plain
[12:38] language right if you had known me you
[12:41] should have known my father also
[12:43] and from nsworth you know him and have
[12:46] seen him amen
[12:49] I don't know how much more plainer that
[12:51] can be yeah
[12:52] now I tell you millions of people are
[12:55] reading this verse and it is veiled to
[12:58] them
[13:00] look at that he's saying from Edgewood
[13:03] you have known him and you have seen him
[13:08] that's why I say what a glorious
[13:10] Revelation to know our God
[13:12] amen now
[13:15] the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:17] which is US each and every one is footly
[13:19] framed in the body of Jesus Christ or to
[13:22] be living and I believe that we are
[13:24] living a rich Royal life
[13:28] amen if we have been fortified by the
[13:31] word of God
[13:33] our life ought to be full of goodness
[13:36] full of the richness of God
[13:38] like a land overflowing with milk and
[13:41] honey
[13:43] people should be eating from the fatness
[13:45] of the land
[13:47] thinking from the fatness of the land
[13:51] amen that's what I tell you do not
[13:53] quench the spirit yes amen amen amen let
[13:57] your life overflow with the spirit
[13:59] because people are hungering and
[14:00] bursting out there but you can live a
[14:03] life so full of the spirit of God that
[14:06] you can be a blessing to others don't
[14:09] matter if they are saved or not but you
[14:11] can be a blessing yes because that's who
[14:14] this royal family is amen a life of
[14:18] service a life of blessing yes
[14:20] now what kind of a life is this it's a
[14:23] life of Faith but we know that faith is
[14:26] a revelation
[14:27] so it's a life of Revelation and the
[14:30] fullness of Revelation like we just said
[14:32] only came at the end time because in the
[14:36] evening time it shall be light amen amen
[14:39] this is not a partial light
[14:43] amen but the full strength of the
[14:46] sunlight the son light is shining in its
[14:49] brilliance
[14:52] now some of you do not feel that way
[14:54] this morning but I'm preaching you into
[14:56] a condition
[14:58] I am preaching you into an atmosphere
[15:00] this morning
[15:01] amen the Brilliance of the sunlight is
[15:05] shining in our lives amen amen and this
[15:08] is the hour that Jesus Christ was
[15:11] waiting for
[15:12] the culmination of all things that Jesus
[15:15] had in his mind
[15:18] amen he paid the price for our
[15:20] Redemption on Calvary and he opened up
[15:22] the way for us to come back to our
[15:25] original position and our Authority
[15:28] now we are we are to be a people who are
[15:30] called by his name and he called us and
[15:33] he said I'll baptize you into my name
[15:35] he said I'll baptize you into my body
[15:37] you people who know me I'm gonna tell
[15:40] you now be baptized in the name of the
[15:43] father and of the son and of the Holy
[15:45] Ghost
[15:46] and then we go and believe that like
[15:49] Peter on the day of Pentecost and we are
[15:52] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:54] Christ amen
[15:55] so he's baptizing us into the body of
[15:58] Christ amen there is no other formula
[16:00] for baptism
[16:02] you must if you want to be in the body
[16:04] of Christ you must come by this formula
[16:07] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[16:10] Jesus Christ
[16:11] for the remission of your sins
[16:14] so what if I was baptized in titles then
[16:17] you have no remission of your sins
[16:21] strong statement I'll say it again if
[16:24] you were baptized in titles you have no
[16:26] remission of your sins
[16:29] and it says and you shall receive the
[16:32] gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[16:34] not initial evidence
[16:38] that's what they have settled for but
[16:41] you shall receive the gifts of the Holy
[16:44] Ghost amen
[16:46] and when the Holy Ghost has come upon
[16:48] you you shall be endured with power come
[16:51] on high
[16:53] am many many men amen and a people that
[16:58] have been called by his name baptized in
[17:01] his name amen now we are all Royal
[17:03] members of the family of Christ
[17:07] listen to what he says
[17:10] you must find yourself a good church
[17:13] a place
[17:15] a church of your choice
[17:17] and there be a royal member of the
[17:21] family of Christ until death sets you
[17:24] free
[17:27] hello
[17:29] isn't that what we are doing
[17:32] now let me read it again some people
[17:34] when they read they read like this
[17:36] you must find yourself
[17:40] a church hop around
[17:45] skip around
[17:47] find a church that suits your itching
[17:50] year
[17:53] hey
[17:54] and there be a Troublesome person in the
[17:57] family of Christ until death sets them
[18:00] free
[18:04] [Music]
[18:06] because really death will set them free
[18:09] from your Troublesome ways but let's
[18:11] read it again you must find yourself in
[18:13] good church
[18:14] a place of your choice how many fear by
[18:17] force did I ever cut the password only
[18:20] ever come to you put a gun to your head
[18:21] and say you need to stay here
[18:24] in church of your choice
[18:26] and there be a royal member of the
[18:30] family of Christ until death sets you
[18:33] free
[18:35] now we know that we are a different
[18:36] people
[18:38] now if you know that being called to
[18:40] Royal life
[18:42] requires you to carry yourself in a
[18:44] certain way yes amen amen you can't
[18:47] dress anyhow
[18:49] you can't carry yourself anyhow
[18:52] that makes sense why dressing was a big
[18:55] part of the message
[18:56] [Music]
[18:57] because you're a royal Queen Hallelujah
[19:00] that's right
[19:02] clothed right Royal apparel
[19:06] you won't find Cape Middleton
[19:08] or
[19:10] the what's this queen concert
[19:14] Camilla dressed anyhow
[19:19] they have the best fashion designers
[19:23] so do we
[19:25] have best fashion designers Hallelujah
[19:29] wait till you get to heaven
[19:32] the prophet says he saw the women
[19:35] diamonds flowing in the Wind
[19:38] you know that perfect picture you always
[19:40] wanted girls wear your dress is just
[19:42] flowing in the wind and flowing
[19:45] the prophet saw you that way
[19:48] hey you know that one where the fan is
[19:50] blowing and the hair is going like that
[19:55] it's your perfect moments
[19:57] [Music]
[19:59] and you won't have bad photographers
[20:01] there you won't be scrolling the
[20:03] photographer that you took a bad picture
[20:05] of me because there'll be no more bad
[20:07] pictures
[20:08] you'll be in the Brilliance of your
[20:10] youth you know some people when they
[20:12] take a picture it's only on this side
[20:13] this is my good sign
[20:18] but then all sides will be good
[20:21] amen you're going back to Brilliance of
[20:23] Youth amen so when you're called to a
[20:26] royal life you are called to a higher
[20:28] order now when you are called to a royal
[20:31] life it means that everything that you
[20:34] have need of will be taken care of
[20:39] the household of the royal King and live
[20:42] a life of squalor and a life of poverty
[20:45] amen now I'm not preaching Prosperity
[20:47] this morning
[20:49] right
[20:51] but yes I am
[20:53] I am telling you that in the king's
[20:56] Palace
[20:57] every need of you should be taking care
[21:00] of you I'm talking about your spiritual
[21:02] prosperity
[21:05] we cannot sulk in the house
[21:07] you know how sometimes the children are
[21:09] when they're angry with you now
[21:12] the KFC is lying there and the Nando's
[21:14] is lying there
[21:16] but because they're angry with you now
[21:17] you're telling them to come eat he said
[21:19] no
[21:20] I'm not hungry but they're starving
[21:25] they're just waiting for you
[21:28] to change the atmosphere a little
[21:30] once the atmosphere changes a little
[21:33] and you watch how the thing is gone
[21:35] before you can see Jack Robinson
[21:38] if you think that Houdini Can Do Magic
[21:42] put food in front of a hungry
[21:46] amen
[21:49] so we are we are peculiar people
[21:52] the Bible says that we are a royal
[21:54] priesthood
[21:56] now what is a priesthood a priesthood
[21:59] offers spiritual sacrifice unto the Lord
[22:02] everybody agreed
[22:04] offering spiritual sacrifices unto the
[22:07] Lord
[22:08] so now you are a royal priesthood a holy
[22:12] nation
[22:13] and the prophet will tell us that our
[22:15] hearts are to Peter's one and what is
[22:19] flowing through the veins if our heart
[22:22] is beating us one what is the heart the
[22:24] heart is a blood pump

[30:25] to have his wife take on his name
[30:29] yes now here in the message
[30:34] the second coming of Christ
[30:37] is it that message or the Philadelphia
[30:39] Church age
[30:40] The Profit now let's just break this
[30:42] down let's read it in its entirety we'll
[30:44] understand it we'll enjoy it too what's
[30:46] the name of God
[30:49] Jesus
[30:52] he said in Heaven and Earth all is named
[30:55] Jesus
[30:57] now you're going to
[30:59] a scripture and the name of the city of
[31:02] my God which is New Jerusalem
[31:05] which comes down out of Heaven from my
[31:07] God
[31:08] I'll put oh if you see it's all the same
[31:11] name you should have caught it
[31:13] and put on him the name of the city of
[31:17] my God
[31:18] the city he goes ahead and say which is
[31:21] New Jerusalem
[31:24] right
[31:27] he says the New Jerusalem I'll put on
[31:29] him the New Jerusalem now the Bride of
[31:32] the church is New Jerusalem how many
[31:36] knows that the church itself is the New
[31:39] Jerusalem you believe that he says let's
[31:42] prove it Revelation 21 I think it is
[31:45] that's they're what I want let's look
[31:49] back here we can show you the Bible says
[31:51] prove all things
[31:53] and he says I saw a new heavens and a
[31:56] new Earth for the first heaven and first
[31:59] Earth was passed away and there was no
[32:01] more sea
[32:03] and I John saw the holy city the New
[32:06] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[32:09] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[32:13] her husband
[32:16] now men quickly go back to the day you
[32:19] got married and then you saw your
[32:21] beautiful wife coming dressed
[32:23] he says she this new city coming down
[32:26] from heaven is prepared the same way
[32:30] you remember guys
[32:31] your best man had to
[32:35] get your eyes back from the floor
[32:36] because your eyes fell down and put it
[32:38] back
[32:40] you remember guys how you were crying
[32:42] when you're crying
[32:43] my wife says I was crying
[32:49] hey when you see
[32:51] this beautiful bride approaching you
[32:55] amen
[32:58] some of you forgot how to be romantic
[33:01] you don't know what I'm talking about
[33:03] amen
[33:06] so he says here where was I
[33:10] okay and prepared as a bride a dawn for
[33:12] husband he says the new church is the
[33:15] Gentile church is the bride the Bride is
[33:18] a gentile and the Gentile has his name
[33:21] amen he took people out of the Gentile
[33:25] for his name's sake amen you believe
[33:28] that if you don't believe he says turn
[33:30] to acts 15 verse 14. and then he's going
[33:33] to read there right
[33:35] he's going to read now men and Brethren
[33:37] arcanon to me Simeon had declared out
[33:40] God at the first did visit the Gentiles
[33:43] to take out of them a people for his
[33:46] name
[33:49] how if you're following me amen
[33:51] brother Branham asked the question what
[33:53] is the name of God
[33:55] right and he said he's reading now
[33:57] Revelation where he says I'll put my
[33:59] name in that City yes right my name in
[34:02] that City so he's breaking that down now
[34:05] so then he took export acts 15 and he's
[34:07] showing you that he's taking a people
[34:09] for his name
[34:10] right
[34:12] and he says I will write upon in the
[34:14] name of my God and the name of the city
[34:17] of my God
[34:18] so he says all that names it's not
[34:20] different names of God he says which is
[34:23] all the same Jesus Jesus Jesus
[34:27] and this is where now we're going to
[34:30] clarify what the prophet is saying
[34:31] because some people don't believe that
[34:32] we are married to Jesus and he says and
[34:35] the bride married to Jesus makes it Mrs
[34:38] Jesus
[34:39] amen
[34:41] amen right
[34:46] there's some mighty fine woman in the
[34:48] building tonight mighty fine but there's
[34:50] one of them that's mine she's got my
[34:53] name I hope you got that she's wearing
[34:56] my name so will his bride
[35:01] so he just baffles the mind that they
[35:04] wouldn't want his name
[35:08] he says now in a message second coming
[35:10] of Christ just to in the mouth of two of
[35:12] three Witnesses let every word be
[35:13] established to show he's just not an
[35:15] isolated quote he says we are not only
[35:18] engaged but we are married
[35:21] the church is married to Christ
[35:23] we are the wife of Christ who are Barren
[35:26] and unfruitful
[35:30] he says we are the wife of Christ
[35:32] bringing fourth children
[35:36] he says that when the woman Church
[35:39] is married to Christ they are no longer
[35:42] two they are one Christ in you his life
[35:45] has been brought into you then you
[35:47] become the bride
[35:50] so you see taking his name is one part
[35:56] but then he comes into a union with you
[35:58] to put his seed word in you
[36:01] and then you bring forth that same word
[36:04] Christ is not just only the written word
[36:10] otherwise why would the bible say that
[36:13] the little killer
[36:16] if you have been following closely the
[36:18] message of the hour you'll know that
[36:20] Christ is always the manifested word
[36:25] he is a prison God
[36:28] amen that's why it's important for you
[36:32] to catch the revelation of the hour see
[36:34] who you are in the world then you become
[36:37] the manifested word
[36:39] other than that we'll be like the
[36:41] lutherans the methodists the Baptists
[36:44] the anglicans just reading from the book
[36:50] but when we say we are married to Christ
[36:52] the word what we are really saying is
[36:55] that we are the manifested word Christ
[36:58] is now manifested through us
[37:00] don't just we're not just talking about
[37:02] a Bible from Genesis to revelation
[37:06] we are talking about a god who's living
[37:08] in the people
[37:10] in fact every day you are writing
[37:12] another book
[37:14] another chapter
[37:16] another page
[37:18] amen now he goes on here in The
[37:21] Invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[37:23] he says if you are married to Christ
[37:25] Christ is the word of God that's what we
[37:29] just tried to explain right
[37:31] let's go to Galatians 3 12. amen I'd
[37:34] like to read the Bible as well amen for
[37:37] young people
[37:40] let's just see in our Galatians chapter
[37:42] 12 3 and verse 12.
[37:53] you know if you add somebody who was
[37:55] living the life
[37:58] of a queen
[38:00] what's the first question you were
[38:02] probably ask him is what's it like
[38:04] living
[38:06] in the palace
[38:08] living under Royal household
[38:13] but now you are the person that people
[38:15] can ask the question to
[38:16] because you are living in this Royal
[38:18] life
[38:21] and remember the purpose of the
[38:23] preaching this morning is that if you
[38:25] are not living in this condition in this
[38:27] level
[38:28] under Royal conditions we invite you to
[38:30] come in and stand here
[38:32] Amen to come up a little higher now
[38:35] let's read verse 12.
[38:37] so now he's talking about the law and
[38:40] how we cannot be perfected by the law
[38:42] what is the law of the Ten Commandments
[38:46] right men in its Fallen nature could
[38:49] never keep the Ten Commandments
[38:50] therefore God
[38:52] instituted the sacrifice
[38:55] if man in his own human ability could
[38:57] keep the Ten Commandments there would be
[38:59] no need for the sacrifice
[39:03] but because man was failing to keep the
[39:05] law there needed to be an atonement made
[39:09] you know
[39:10] right
[39:11] so he says the law is not a faith
[39:14] because the law can never produce faith
[39:18] how can you afraid in your flesh when
[39:20] you know your flesh will fail the law
[39:23] he says the law is not a faith but the
[39:26] man that Drew them shall live in them
[39:29] if you want to keep the law you've got
[39:31] to live by the law
[39:33] and you'll also die by the law
[39:35] right that's what he's trying to express
[39:37] then he says but Christ has redeemed us
[39:39] from the curse of the Lord
[39:43] whoa
[39:47] you mean God gave Moses the Ten
[39:49] Commandments
[39:50] and and that the Jews consider the
[39:52] sacred texts and now this who is this
[39:57] Apostle calling him cursed
[40:02] remember he's laying the foundation
[40:05] he's saying the curse of the law
[40:10] being made a curse for us
[40:13] for it is written cursed is everyone
[40:16] that hangs on a tree
[40:18] so he became a curse for us
[40:21] that now what this is what we are
[40:22] getting to remember we are talking about
[40:24] the Royal life and blessings
[40:26] so we are saying all that the blessings
[40:28] of Abraham listen to what he says why
[40:31] did he do this that The Blessing of
[40:33] Abraham might come unto the Gentiles to
[40:36] Jesus Christ
[40:41] that we might receive the promise of the
[40:45] spirit through faith
[40:48] so we have the blessings of Abraham
[40:51] in fact I want you to consider this
[40:53] point
[40:55] if the Jews
[40:57] who have rejected Christ
[41:00] are prospering and thriving
[41:05] under the law
[41:09] they have not accepted Jesus right
[41:12] so they are still under the law
[41:15] if the Jews are excelling
[41:18] to such a level
[41:20] under the law
[41:21] how much more spiritual Jews amen under
[41:24] grace
[41:26] the Jews I really bless people you don't
[41:30] know how much of wealth the Jews have
[41:32] actually go and search it out you'll see
[41:35] the Jews are a prosperous Nation not
[41:38] only are they blessed the land is
[41:39] blessed
[41:42] to look at the technology coming out of
[41:44] Israel
[41:46] they are prospering in a desert Land
[41:49] look at the water how they are able to
[41:51] produce water their vegetation and
[41:54] farming you heard of the kaboots
[41:57] amen they have crops that are growing in
[42:01] that once was a desolate place
[42:06] but that's what he's trying to express
[42:08] here
[42:09] and tell us
[42:11] that if they receive this under a
[42:13] natural law
[42:15] how much more glorious should we be
[42:17] living in Christ
[42:19] we should be living a royal life of
[42:21] blessing
[42:23] do not live under god-given privileges
[42:27] speak the word and go forth
[42:29] amen I tell you the authority and the
[42:32] power lies in the power of your tongue
[42:34] amen amen amen and too many times we are
[42:37] just professing negativity but I want
[42:40] you to have a positive confession I want
[42:43] you to go forth in faith and over every
[42:45] situation proclaim the name of the Lord
[42:48] over every circumstance proclaim the
[42:51] name of the Lord amen if you see a dry
[42:54] and a a man a deserted place I want you
[42:58] to speak the name of the Lord over that
[43:00] if Fitness is a drive and deserted place
[43:03] in your life I want you to speak the
[43:05] name of the Lord over that
[43:09] why he says because we have received the
[43:12] promise of the spirit through faith
[43:16] now watch what he says no greater
[43:18] blessing than the spirit which is God in
[43:22] you
[43:22] is that in the Bible
[43:24] hello he's saying there can be no
[43:27] greater blessing
[43:30] oh how grateful we are to have the holy
[43:32] spirit amen no greater blessing
[43:37] amen then the spirit of God which is in
[43:39] US
[43:40] amen hallelujah
[43:43] amen we have the source of all blessings
[43:46] we are not satisfied with blessings
[43:48] alone
[43:49] amen we can say without a shadow of
[43:52] doubt that we have The Giver of the
[43:55] blessings amen amen now he says here for
[43:58] you are the children of God by faith in
[44:00] Christ Jesus for as many
[44:03] of you has been baptized into Christ
[44:05] have put on Christ watches breaking it
[44:08] down now we've just been through it but
[44:10] here it is in the Bible he's showing you
[44:12] how you've come through the stages you
[44:14] were baptized into Christ have put on
[44:16] Christ he says therefore there is no Jew
[44:19] no Greek no Bundle free male or female
[44:23] for you are all one in Christ Jesus
[44:27] now he reiterates this if you be Christ
[44:30] then you are Abraham's seed and heirs
[44:34] according to the promise
[44:38] amen
[44:40] let's just leave that for them
[44:42] we go to I'll turn our Focus now to
[44:45] Isaiah chapter 6 and verse 2.
[44:48] we know amen this will speak quite a lot
[44:50] to know pastoran he should take this
[44:51] quite a bit
[44:53] amen
[44:55] Hosea 6 and 2 he says after two days he
[44:59] will he revive us
[45:02] in the third you will raise us up
[45:06] and we shall live in his sight
[45:11] so there is coming a promised Revival
[45:16] amen you'll find the propheties breaking
[45:19] into this down
[45:21] in recognizing your day and its message
[45:23] I don't have the poacher you can go and
[45:26] read it way is breaking the scripture
[45:28] down
[45:29] and he's showing you that after
[45:32] two days
[45:34] right you know each day times a thousand
[45:37] years after two thousand years there is
[45:39] coming a promised Revival
[45:42] now this revival
[45:46] it's a resurrection
[45:48] it says in the third day so remember
[45:51] after two days is the third day everyone
[45:54] agreed after two days you'll revive us
[45:58] in the third day he raised us up
[46:02] and we shall live in his sight
[46:04] so then he's breaking down showing you
[46:06] how six trumpets have sounded driven him
[46:10] to the Homeland
[46:11] waiting for that seven trumpet
[46:13] okay and then he tells you the bride
[46:16] must be taken out of the way now so that
[46:18] Moses and Elijah can speak to them right
[46:22] now we want to go to verse 3 as well
[46:24] then he says then shall we know if we
[46:27] follow on to know the Lord he is going
[46:29] forth prepared as the morning oh what a
[46:33] glorious thing
[46:35] two scriptures come to mind
[46:38] there's joy in the morning
[46:41] right what comes in the morning
[46:43] Joy
[46:44] also his mercies and you every morning
[46:48] so he is coming as the morning
[46:51] he is coming with joy
[46:53] he is coming with Mercy
[46:54] [Music]
[46:56] and he shall come
[46:58] unto us as the rain
[47:01] oh Hallelujah
[47:04] if you are not Farmers you don't know
[47:06] the value of brain
[47:08] amen but he is coming to us as the rain
[47:11] now there are two types of rain
[47:14] there is the latter rain and the former
[47:16] rain
[47:17] unto the Earth
[47:19] now the former reign
[47:22] you would know is the one that comes at
[47:24] springtime
[47:27] what is that to water the seed
[47:31] everybody following the first ring is to
[47:35] water the sea
[47:37] but then there is coming a lettering
[47:40] what is rain the province is teaching
[47:43] rain
[47:44] now you know when the prophet was coming
[47:46] with this teaching Reign why they went
[47:49] to him and said brother Graham you have
[47:51] such an anointed gift of healing why are
[47:54] you confusing the people and teaching
[47:58] but he was coming with a letter in
[48:02] the teaching ring
[48:04] amen so he says he is going for prepared
[48:08] as the morning and he shall come unto us
[48:10] as the rain
[48:12] as the latter and the former Reign unto
[48:14] the Earth and I want to tell you that
[48:16] this bride has had both Reigns amen
[48:19] therefore she is living a prosperous
[48:21] life and she is bringing forth the fruit
[48:23] of Christ is because she has had the
[48:26] teaching Reign she has had both the
[48:28] former and the lettering
[48:30] amen and two days has passed and we are
[48:33] living in the third day amen and we are
[48:36] bound to be resurrected in the third day
[48:39] because that's what the scripture says
[48:41] amen how many of you are looking forward
[48:43] to the resurrection and the changing of
[48:45] the body amen when we shall be caught up
[48:48] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[48:52] let's go to Esther chapter 5 and verse
[48:54] 1.
[48:58] talking about the life of a royal Queen
[49:00] amen
[49:01] it says here it came to pass on what day
[49:04] why did I read Hosea to get to this
[49:07] amen you should know I don't read things
[49:09] without going to something
[49:10] when was he going to revive us bring us
[49:13] back to life what day
[49:16] hello
[49:17] everybody said third day when is Esther
[49:21] coming now it came to pass on what day
[49:24] the third day that Esther put on a royal
[49:27] apparel
[49:29] and stood in the inner Court of the king
[49:32] not in the outer Court
[49:34] this is the age of the inner Court
[49:37] Hallelujah
[49:38] now I tell you people will read right
[49:40] over those things but the spirit of God
[49:42] is here this morning to I like those
[49:45] things amen
[49:48] I'm telling you that because I only said
[49:49] that right now
[49:51] amen put on a royal apparel and stood in
[49:54] the inner Court of the King's house over
[49:56] against the King's house and the King
[49:58] set on his Royal Throne I like how they
[50:01] use the word Royal for everything here
[50:03] because that's how you must live your
[50:05] life
[50:07] you don't just say Amen
[50:09] you give a royal amen
[50:11] you don't just say hallelujah you give a
[50:13] royal Hallelujah
[50:15] can I hear it this morning
[50:17] amen
[50:22] you know
[50:23] many other women can call your husband
[50:27] but when you call him
[50:31] sweetest note in serif song
[50:39] there's no one can see his name like you
[50:42] now his name is not him
[50:49] no one because he knows when you say hey
[50:51] he's in trouble
[50:53] right
[50:55] but listen now he says here Royal Throne
[50:58] Royal house over against the Gate of the
[51:02] house
[51:05] and it was so when the king saw Esther
[51:07] the queen standing in the court
[51:11] did she obtain fever in his sight
[51:16] and the King held out to Esther the
[51:19] golden scepter
[51:21] that was
[51:23] in his hand
[51:26] what was in this one that was standing
[51:29] in the midst of seven golden
[51:30] candlesticks
[51:32] what was his hand
[51:36] hello
[51:39] students of the word
[51:42] what was the one standing in the midst
[51:45] of seven golden candlesticks what was in
[51:47] his hand
[51:48] Seven Stars
[51:50] which people on the face of the Earth
[51:53] have a revelation of those Seven Stars
[51:55] amen where can you find that revelation
[51:59] only in the message of the hour
[52:02] so did he stretch forth his
[52:05] hand over you
[52:07] and give you
[52:09] Seven Stars
[52:11] reveal all their names
[52:14] Esther Junior and touched the top of the
[52:17] septum
[52:19] then said the king unto her
[52:21] now I want you now before I read this I
[52:24] want you to know he is not informing of
[52:27] a privileges but he is reminding us
[52:32] when he is asking at this now
[52:35] he is not
[52:37] that now you are able to ask and do this
[52:39] he is reminding her of her position in
[52:42] the Kingdom
[52:44] let's read what will come Queen Esther
[52:48] you see how it refers to you
[52:51] amen
[52:53] what will down Queen Esther
[52:57] yes
[52:58] what is thy request
[53:02] name
[53:05] you see if you ask anything in my name
[53:07] amen it shall be given
[53:11] didn't the real king of King say that
[53:15] it shall be given given thee to half the
[53:19] kingdom
[53:21] half of it is mine
[53:25] he is reminding her of a position in the
[53:27] Kingdom
[53:28] what will thou Esther
[53:31] what is your request
[53:33] it shall be given thee to half the
[53:36] kingdom
[53:38] of the Kingdom
[53:40] that's where we're going to stop there
[53:41] in that story because
[53:44] we've got to go to Ephesians 1 and verse
[53:46] 13. we have a lot of scriptures to cover
[53:47] this morning Ephesians 1 verse 3 sorry
[53:50] Ephesians 1 and 3 says now let's look at
[53:53] some of our blessings blessed be the God
[53:55] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[53:58] had blessed us with all spiritual
[54:01] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[54:05] in verse 10 he says now I want you to
[54:08] know that the dispensation of the
[54:10] fullness of time if we have time some
[54:11] other time we'll show you the quotes
[54:13] that is the seventh seal
[54:15] the fullness of time
[54:18] right so remember the fullness of time
[54:19] is the seventh seal I can remember I can
[54:23] jog your memory quickly remember he says
[54:24] it's the end of all things end of the
[54:26] struggling world end of nature he says
[54:29] it's even the ushering in of the
[54:30] Millennium so he says it's the fullness
[54:33] of time so this he says if we read it
[54:36] another way that under the seventh seal
[54:39] he might gather together in one all
[54:42] things in Christ
[54:43] does he gather everything under the
[54:45] seventh seal
[54:46] both which are in heaven which on Earth
[54:49] even in him is that us
[54:52] come read now with understanding where
[54:55] is the bride
[54:56] in that day you shall know as I am in
[54:58] the Father the father in me I knew you
[55:00] in
[55:01] me
[55:02] even in him
[55:04] in whom also we have obtained an
[55:08] inheritance there's a point on again we
[55:11] have an inheritance you ask what's the
[55:13] inheritance let's get to The Inheritance
[55:14] verse 13. you were sealed with that Holy
[55:17] Spirit of promise
[55:18] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[55:22] now it's not the fullness of our
[55:23] inheritance it's the down payment of our
[55:25] inheritance
[55:28] right
[55:30] we have an Earnest of our inheritance
[55:33] until the Redemption of the purchased
[55:35] position
[55:37] which he wrote In Christ when he raised
[55:40] him up from the dead and set him at his
[55:43] own right hand in Heavenly places now
[55:45] the reason we're going into this I want
[55:47] you again to recognize half of it is
[55:49] yours far above principalities
[55:55] so principality should you shouldn't
[55:57] have a problem with principalities and
[55:58] Powers
[55:59] he raised him above principalities
[56:02] so you can conquer principalities right
[56:05] power half of it is yours might Dominion
[56:10] every name that is named not only in
[56:14] this world but also in that which is to
[56:17] come amen
[56:19] and he had put all things under his feet
[56:23] if it's under his feet it's under your
[56:26] feet
[56:27] and gave him to be held over all things
[56:31] to the church which is his body the
[56:34] fullness of him that fill it all in all
[56:40] digest that ponder that the fullness of
[56:44] him
[56:45] is you
[56:47] that fill it all in all
[56:50] now Paul is really giving meat there but
[56:51] we don't have time to dwell on that
[56:53] Ephesians 2 and verse 4.
[56:55] talking about now more of our
[56:57] inheritance more of our blessings
[57:00] God who is rich in Mercy
[57:03] for his great love wherever he loved us
[57:05] even when we were dead in sins
[57:09] had quickened us together with Christ
[57:12] and it raised us up together to sit
[57:14] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[57:19] I pray that the spirit just quickened
[57:21] that to you now because we just read how
[57:23] Jesus was raised into Heavenly places
[57:25] and now Paul is telling us that we sit
[57:28] together in Heavenly places showing that
[57:30] you are co-ab you are queen right
[57:34] that that time you were without Christ
[57:37] being aliens from the Commonwealth of
[57:39] Israel strangers from the Covenant or
[57:41] promise having no hope and without God
[57:45] in the world
[57:46] but now in Christ Jesus you were
[57:49] sometimes were far off a maid nigh by
[57:52] the blood of Christ
[57:54] oh church I don't have time to really
[57:57] dwell on this but I want you to go and
[57:59] you know sometimes when you got to soak
[58:01] something
[58:01] you know when you have to soak your rice
[58:04] or marinate your meat because you want
[58:07] it to become tender read that scripture
[58:09] again because the blood wasn't only for
[58:11] salvation
[58:13] listen to what he's saying there
[58:16] now in Christ you were sometimes far off
[58:18] I made nigh by the blood of Jesus
[58:22] you are brought into the Royal household
[58:24] by the blood of Jesus you are living a
[58:27] royal life because of the blood of Jesus
[58:29] you have the blessings of healing
[58:31] Deliverance salvation because of the
[58:34] blood of Jesus
[58:36] see he says here for he is our peace who
[58:39] had made both one and had broken down
[58:42] the middle wall of petition
[58:44] let's bring this to a close now
[58:46] for two thousand years of church history
[58:52] God has been building his bride for such
[58:54] a time as this
[59:00] time this
[59:01] is the season
[59:02] this is the hour that all creation
[59:05] all seven Church ages I've been waiting
[59:08] for
[59:10] in a play in a flim in a drama
[59:13] everyone is waiting for the climax
[59:17] the tension is being built up during the
[59:19] previous scenes and everyone is waiting
[59:22] to see how it's all gonna end
[59:24] especially in a thriller
[59:26] you don't know how it's going to end
[59:29] now the fate of the world ends in a
[59:31] balance
[59:32] the shift a play for power Satan's about
[59:36] to make his greatest move
[59:39] for the control of the world
[59:42] in the greatest battle ever fought
[59:46] so we are now living in the climax of
[59:48] things and in the climax is when all
[59:51] things will be revealed
[59:57] what they proved there for seven Church
[59:59] ages
[1:00:01] the prophecies they tied some loose ends
[1:00:04] but they also missed some loose ends
[1:00:08] and and through the colors are some
[1:00:11] loose ends that he said the just shall
[1:00:12] live by faith and he tied there
[1:00:16] amen and was recorded another loose end
[1:00:20] and he said sanctification by the blood
[1:00:22] of Jesus
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:25] this is a spirit are pouring caught
[1:00:27] another loose him
[1:00:29] and they receive the outpouring of the
[1:00:31] Holy Spirit but they never stayed to
[1:00:33] receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:38] amen
[1:00:39] but what was the Holy Ghost doing it was
[1:00:42] walking through the scenes bringing us
[1:00:44] to the climax
[1:00:46] I want you to know the Azusa Street
[1:00:48] outpouring was not the climax
[1:00:52] under the first pool it wasn't the
[1:00:54] climax it was the scene being built up
[1:00:58] if I could type those pulls it's like
[1:01:00] Hosea 6 said after two days I will
[1:01:03] revive you and I will raise you up again
[1:01:05] after two calls
[1:01:08] the Revival came
[1:01:10] under the third pool amen amen
[1:01:14] Hallelujah the climax came on the
[1:01:18] sounding of the seventh Angel's message
[1:01:20] the mighty Angel crying with a loud
[1:01:23] voice and the sounding of seven Thunders
[1:01:26] amen now I want you to not grow weary
[1:01:29] with the climax
[1:01:31] don't grow weary with the climax we are
[1:01:34] almost at the End Amen amen we should be
[1:01:37] sledding at the climax
[1:01:39] amen because all things are ready now in
[1:01:43] fact the voice is about to ready to be
[1:01:45] cried with the angels lifting up his
[1:01:48] hand to heaven to say that time shall be
[1:01:51] no more
[1:01:52] amen you remember the time the prophet
[1:01:55] was going to watch that show and he says
[1:01:57] the voice came on of a sudden and he
[1:01:59] said Let the Fire Fall
[1:02:02] the fire is about to fall over this
[1:02:05] Legacy and church age and all is
[1:02:07] ungodliness amen everything is falling
[1:02:11] into place all that was prophesied about
[1:02:14] this bride has come to pass I want you
[1:02:17] to know that everything that brother

[1:04:29] restoration message Elijah the prophet
[1:04:32] was sent to us like a Malachi 4 verse 5
[1:04:35] and 6 promised amen he came before The

[1:11:10] to eat peanuts
[1:11:12] that's flashing red light you know that
[1:11:16] the bride is waiting with the faith in
[1:11:18] our hearts to change the physical atoms
[1:11:20] in our body
[1:11:23] she's going to defy gravity

[1:11:33] move past that sixth Dimension right
[1:11:36] into the seven Dimension to be seated

[1:11:41] David said will we leap over walls
[1:11:46] will we change dimensions listen to what
[1:11:48] the prophet says now
[1:11:53] don't fear John
[1:11:56] dear little flock all that I am you are
[1:12:00] heir to
[1:12:02] all my power is yours
[1:12:06] my omnipotence is yours as I stand in
[1:12:09] your midst
[1:12:11] I want you to hear the voice of that
[1:12:13] Mighty Angel right now
[1:12:15] and put it present tense
[1:12:17] you are here to my power is yours my
[1:12:20] omnipotence is yours as I stand in your
[1:12:22] midst I have not come to bring fear and
[1:12:26] failure but love and courage and ability
[1:12:31] all power is given unto me and it's
[1:12:34] yours to use
[1:12:36] you speak the word and I will perform it
[1:12:39] that is my Covenant it can never failure
[1:12:54] I'm letting that settle me
[1:12:58] somebody needs that this morning
[1:13:02] listen to what he's telling you
[1:13:04] living a life a royal life
[1:13:08] and partaking of his Royal blessings
[1:13:11] this is his word to you this morning
[1:13:13] all that I am you are here to all my
[1:13:16] power is yours my omnipotence is yours
[1:13:19] as I stand in your midst I have not come
[1:13:21] to bring fear and failure but love and

[1:13:30] yours to use
[1:13:34] you speak the word and I will perform it
[1:13:37] that is my Covenant it can never fail
[1:13:42] Ure we're going to close with two
[1:13:43] portions of scripture
[1:13:47] let's turn to it in Revelation chapter
[1:13:48] 19.
[1:13:50] the reason why I want to end with this
[1:13:52] is we read in the Bible how God promised
[1:13:55] blessings to Abraham
[1:13:58] we read how he promised blessings to
[1:14:00] Jacob Isaac
[1:14:02] we read many places
[1:14:05] and sometimes we we sit and we think wow
[1:14:08] God personally made a promise to him
[1:14:12] can you imagine God almighty
[1:14:16] physically coming down and making a
[1:14:17] promise to those people
[1:14:19] and keeping that promise
[1:14:22] so is there a portion in the world
[1:14:26] that's not claimed
[1:14:28] but it's directed to the bride but just
[1:14:31] like how we picked up Revelation 10 8 to
[1:14:34] 11 and said that's ours somebody needs
[1:14:37] to go and take this promise and
[1:14:40] recognized where a blessing lies
[1:14:43] everyone following my thoughts
[1:14:45] I'm saying there's portions of
[1:14:47] scriptures two portions right now
[1:14:50] that only you as the bride living in
[1:14:52] this Royal life and blessings
[1:14:55] can go and pick up let's read it
[1:14:58] Revelation chapter 19
[1:15:02] and verse six let's start from there I
[1:15:04] heard as you were the voice of a great
[1:15:06] multitude the voice of many waters you
[1:15:08] know that's a fightful Ministry voice of
[1:15:10] Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for
[1:15:13] the Lord God omnipotent brainer
[1:15:15] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:15:18] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:15:20] Lamb is come and his wife had made
[1:15:22] herself ready
[1:15:24] amen and to her was granted to be a raid
[1:15:27] in fine living when was Esther done
[1:15:31] third day
[1:15:33] clean and white
[1:15:35] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:15:37] of the Saints now watch
[1:15:40] the the one that is speaking to that is
[1:15:43] making these statements is now turning
[1:15:45] his attention to John the same one in
[1:15:47] Revelation 10 verse 8 where we say we
[1:15:49] are
[1:15:50] everyone following me amen he's now
[1:15:52] speaking a word directly to the bride
[1:15:56] and he's going to bless you
[1:15:59] he's going to give a blessing
[1:16:02] bless
[1:16:04] are they
[1:16:06] which are called
[1:16:08] unto the married supper of the Lamb amen
[1:16:12] amen
[1:16:14] there's a blessing
[1:16:17] now in Revelation
[1:16:19] to them that are called
[1:16:21] did you even call you behold the private
[1:16:25] group coming amen going out to meet him
[1:16:28] who cried that out
[1:16:30] William Branham
[1:16:33] so he's telling I want you to know that
[1:16:35] William Branham speaking here now
[1:16:38] let's follow it
[1:16:40] because if you go and read further down
[1:16:42] John wants to now bow before the same
[1:16:44] show
[1:16:46] right and he says don't do it John yes
[1:16:49] but watch I want you to catch this alone
[1:16:52] if you catch nothing else you are
[1:16:54] blessed because you are called to the
[1:16:56] marriage of the Lamb amen
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:16:59] and he said unto me these are the true
[1:17:02] Sins Of God what is that
[1:17:05] that's another way of saying thus save
[1:17:08] the Lord
[1:17:13] bless that they were called to the
[1:17:14] merits of the Lamb thus saith the Lord
[1:17:17] [Music]
[1:17:20] let's turn to revelation 22 verse 6.
[1:17:23] Another Blessing
[1:17:25] so there's a people that are called to
[1:17:28] the married couple of the Lamb
[1:17:31] then here's another blessing he said
[1:17:34] unto me these are the faithful and true
[1:17:36] and the Lord God of the holy prophet
[1:17:39] sent his Angel to show unto his servants
[1:17:41] of things which must shortly be done
[1:17:43] behold now this is the Lord Jesus
[1:17:45] speaking behold I come quickly
[1:17:49] and what is now attaching and blessing
[1:17:51] again
[1:17:52] blessed are is he that keepeth the sins
[1:17:56] of the prophecy of this book
[1:18:02] foreign
[1:18:07] let's break that down
[1:18:09] you are blessed with your call to the
[1:18:11] married supper and you are blessed if
[1:18:13] you keep the prophecy of this book yes
[1:18:15] there's only one people on the Earth
[1:18:18] that's called to the marriage that's you
[1:18:21] yes and there's only one people in the
[1:18:23] entire Earth that's keeping the prophecy
[1:18:26] of this book amen so you have a double
[1:18:28] portion listen yeah a double portion
[1:18:30] anointing give God praise
[1:18:33] yeah
[1:18:34] so
[1:18:37] he's saying to keep the sayings of the
[1:18:39] prophecy of this book then one must be
[1:18:41] able to understand the prophecy of this
[1:18:43] book right if you have to keep the
[1:18:45] prophecy of the book you must understand
[1:18:47] the prophecy of the book
[1:18:49] now in order to understand it I'm
[1:18:51] closing now the prophet says you have to
[1:18:53] get into the spirit of the composer to
[1:18:55] understand the prophecy
[1:18:57] so one must what have what prophetic
[1:18:59] insight
[1:19:01] and one must have the spirit of Prophecy
[1:19:03] which is the testimony of Jesus I'm
[1:19:05] going to close with this quote it's
[1:19:07] going to take the operation of the Holy
[1:19:09] Spirit
[1:19:09] that means this book can't be revealed
[1:19:12] to anyone but a special class of people
[1:19:17] amen you know in school when they told
[1:19:18] you must go to special class
[1:19:22] now you are in special class
[1:19:26] that time it was a bad thing now it's a
[1:19:29] good thing
[1:19:30] anyone ask me where you may say I go to
[1:19:32] special class
[1:19:36] it's for a special class of people
[1:19:38] I need to take one or prophetic Insight
[1:19:41] it will require the ability to hear from
[1:19:45] God
[1:19:47] so only you have the year to hear what
[1:19:49] the spirit is saying to the church this
[1:19:51] morning amen so the life of a Believer
[1:19:55] is really a royal life

[1:20:03] lamb and you are keeping the sayings of
