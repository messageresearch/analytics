[3:30] earth to match God's word amen according
[3:34] to God's pattern amen so we praise the
[3:37] Lord for that amen so I pray amen that
[3:39] you'll be blessed this morning as well
[3:41] we speak this morning amen I want to
[3:42] speak a bit on uh the opening up of
[3:45] spiritual Frontiers we started this on
[3:48] wedes day and if you were not here on
[3:50] wedness day amen I'm not sure if the
[3:52] message has been loaded yet but if you
[3:55] haven't you should listen to that amen
[3:58] we were speaking on the opening of of
[4:00] spiritual Frontiers and we took J's
[4:02] prayer and now we ask the Lord to
[4:04] enlarge his territory amen so this
[4:07] morning we want to speak on the opening
[4:08] up of spiritual Frontiers and look how
[4:11] the seven seal Frontier opened up to us
[4:13] to connect us with the real
[4:15] us amen this is the frontier that's been
[4:18] opened up to us and now because that
[4:21] Revelation is so strong the gates of
[4:23] hell can't stand against this Revelation
[4:26] I can make you believe something about
[4:27] somebody else and Satan won't be
[4:29] bothered yes that's right but when the
[4:31] frontier is opened up to you and I'll
[4:33] make you realize who you are Satan is
[4:36] powerless because sons and daughters are
[4:38] rising up in their position hallelujah
[4:40] amen praise the Lord amen so we'll turn
[4:42] to our Bible amen this morning let's
[4:44] turn to Revelation amen before we go to
[4:48] Revelation let's turn to Genesis 1
[4:50] praise the Lord get to the beginning
[4:58] there Genesis chapter 1 you should know
[5:00] this thing off our heart now amen praise
[5:03] the Lord and God said let us make man in
[5:05] our image after our
[5:09] likeness and let them have dominion over
[5:11] the fish of the sea and over the foul of
[5:14] the air and over the cattle and over all
[5:17] the Earth and over every creeping thing
[5:19] that creepeth upon the Earth so God
[5:21] created man in his own image in the
[5:24] image of God created he him male and
[5:26] female created he them then we'll go to
[5:29] Genesis ch
[5:31] 3 amen so that's a man that God created
[5:34] to have dominion Genesis chapter 2 we
[5:37] know God puts that man in a flesh body
[5:39] and he puts him in a garden to work and
[5:41] then he gives him a wife Genesis chter 3
[5:44] now the serpent comes in and he deceives
[5:47] the woman
[5:51] amen so we want to read maybe the end
[5:53] portion of Genesis 3 and see
[5:58] here from maybe verse vers uh
[6:01] 21 unto Adam also and his wife did the
[6:04] Lord make coats of skin and
[6:06] clothing now why I'm reading that watch
[6:09] it's all to do with a covering first one
[6:11] was Spirit man second in chapter two he
[6:14] puts him in a flesh body three now
[6:16] instead of him going into a perfect body
[6:18] he's now got a body of skin a clothing a
[6:21] covering of skin animal
[6:24] skin so he says let us make coats of
[6:26] skin and clothe them and the Lord God
[6:29] said behold a man is become as one of us
[6:32] to know good and evil and now lest he
[6:35] put forth his hand and take also of the
[6:38] tree of life and eat and live forever we
[6:40] know brother Brandon tells us that tree
[6:42] of life is Jesus Christ amen can you say
[6:44] Amen to that amen so you see if man had
[6:48] eaten in that condition he would have
[6:49] had eternal life in a fallen condition
[6:52] but now watch he's going to do something
[6:55] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[6:56] from the Garden of Eden to till the
[6:58] ground from whence he was taken so he
[7:00] drove out the man and he placed at the
[7:03] east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and
[7:05] a flaming sword which turned every way
[7:08] to keep the way of the tree of life amen
[7:12] so there now we know his title deed is
[7:13] taken away then we go to Revelation
[7:15] chapter 5 amen you can be seated we'll
[7:18] read it as we continue I don't want to
[7:19] keep you standing praise the
[7:27] Lord Revelation 5 now this is the title
[7:30] deed inheritance that got taken away
[7:32] from Adam now we are thrown into the
[7:36] scene where where this book comes back
[7:38] into view amen and we see
[7:43] here that a strong Angel is proclaiming
[7:46] from verse two who is worthy to open the
[7:48] book and loose the seals and no man in
[7:51] Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the
[7:53] Earth was able to open the book neither
[7:55] to look there on now we know brother
[7:57] Bram tells us this book is a titled
[7:59] Deeds of man's inheritance just pay
[8:01] attention to that amen and I wept much
[8:03] because no man was found worthy to open
[8:05] the book to read the book neither to
[8:07] look there on what a book this must be
[8:10] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[8:12] not behold the lon of the tribe of Judah
[8:14] the root of David that prevailed to open
[8:16] the book and loose the seals thereof and
[8:19] I beheld and low in the midst of the
[8:21] throne and in the midst of the four
[8:23] beasts in the midst of the elders stood
[8:25] a lamb as it had been slain having seven
[8:28] arms and seven eyes which are the seven
[8:30] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[8:33] Earth and he came and took the book out
[8:35] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[8:38] the throne and when he had taken the
[8:40] book The Four beasts and the four and 20
[8:42] Elders fell down before the lamb having
[8:45] every one of them Ops and golden vials
[8:47] full of odors which are the praise of
[8:49] the
[8:50] Saints and they sung a new song saying
[8:52] thou worthy to take the book and open
[8:54] the seals thereof for thou was slain and
[8:57] has redeemed us to God by the blood out
[8:59] of every Kindred tongue people and
[9:03] nation and has made us unto our God
[9:06] priest Kings and Priests and we shall
[9:08] reign on the earth amen praise the Lord
[9:11] so the Lord had blessings to the reading
[9:13] of his word
[9:15] amen so is everybody relaxed I don't
[9:18] want you to be tense in his presence
[9:21] amen we are living in a very late hour a
[9:23] very serious hour amen you'll find as
[9:26] the word of God is being preached people
[9:30] taking offense to the word of God people
[9:33] don't want us to preach the true
[9:35] revelation of the word yes people want
[9:37] us to compromise with the word amen but
[9:40] our goal as a five-fold Ministry is to
[9:43] preach a word that will change your
[9:45] bodies amen amen
[9:48] hallelujah amen so our word is like we
[9:51] were speaking on on wedness day maybe
[9:54] just to overlap into today's service we
[9:57] were talking about when NE is saying
[10:00] enlarge my territory enlarge my
[10:03] border have a concern for our own lives
[10:06] Hallelujah don't just be satisfied with
[10:08] the status quo Hallelujah with what we
[10:11] have right now yes amen no matter how I
[10:14] we get into the spiritual Realms there's
[10:16] Al always greater Realms that we can go
[10:18] to amen so always ask the Lord enlarge
[10:21] my territory amen amen if you got faith
[10:24] say Lord enlarge my faith maybe you got
[10:27] a bit of Revelation say Lord enlarge my
[10:29] Revelation enlarge my position in the
[10:32] body of
[10:33] Christ amen so we've got to enlarge our
[10:36] image which is the image of God Amen
[10:39] which is a character and a good moral
[10:40] character take it from that now to the
[10:43] character of
[10:44] Christ enlarge me from Human Nature to
[10:47] Divine Nature amen enlarge me from the
[10:50] image of Adam to the image of Jesus
[10:52] Christ amen amen then we find as we are
[10:55] building ourselves now we've got to
[10:57] enlarge ourselves yes we've got to grow
[11:00] up in Christ amen amen like Peter
[11:03] describing enlarge your border from
[11:05] Faith to Virtue from virtue to knowledge
[11:07] from knowledge to Temperance from
[11:09] Temperance to patience from patience to
[11:11] Godliness from godliness to brotherly
[11:14] kindness and from go brotherly kindness
[11:16] to charity we've got to enlarge
[11:18] ourselves in this area amen you've got
[11:22] to enlarge yourself from this ibrd
[11:24] Fallen body to a redeemed body to a
[11:26] glorified body amen so how do we do that
[11:30] how do I
[11:31] connect amen that's the job of a fold
[11:35] Ministry and my job is your pastor as a
[11:37] minister he take you from the realm of
[11:39] the five senses yes is to pull you into
[11:43] the realm of the six sense thank you
[11:45] amen pull you out of the five senses
[11:47] pull you into the realm of perfect faith
[11:49] that is Heavenly
[11:51] places Amen to tell you more about
[11:54] yourself more than what you know you say
[11:57] oh but brother you don't know you don't
[11:58] spend time with me I know more about you
[12:01] than you know about yourself because I'm
[12:03] tapping into spiritual laws I'm tapping
[12:06] into amen discernment and I'm tapping
[12:08] into the spirit of God Amen thank you
[12:10] Lord yes Lord in fact brother brandom
[12:13] says you only need five minutes to spend
[12:15] with somebody that's right to tell what
[12:17] kind of character they are what kind of
[12:19] nature they are amen what kind of spirit
[12:21] they
[12:22] are amen so you can't fool a a fivefold
[12:26] minister Hallelujah because he's got the
[12:28] spirit of discernment amen amen
[12:31] hallelujah praise the Lord so we go
[12:34] beyond the realm of science science
[12:36] specializes in the realm of the flesh
[12:39] amen but there's more to you than the
[12:40] human body amen we have a spirit we have
[12:44] a soul and inside of that soul is a
[12:47] predestinated seed Gene of God can

[13:08] its meaning people read Revelation 8
[13:11] verse1 they don't know the meaning I'm
[13:14] going to say it now they don't know that
[13:16] the prophet of God says that the silence
[13:18] in Revelation 81 the setting of it is
[13:20] found in Revelation 10 amen but nobody

[17:38] amen now we walking in perfect Faith
[17:40] amen we are sons who are coming into
[17:42] adoption the guide the teacher the
[17:44] spirit of Truth is here for our adoption
[17:47] ceremony now don't be like Peter at
[17:49] Jesus adoption ceremony he did not know
[17:52] how to cope with the supernatural amen
[17:55] he wanted to make three Tabernacles amen
[17:57] one for thee one for Moses one for
[18:00] Elijah we can't be confused about the
[18:03] supernatural amen you called to fight
[18:06] amen you are called to overcome you are
[18:09] called to advance the kingdom amen so
[18:11] when Adam when when Adam's Body now when
[18:14] he fell it became a hybrid
[18:18] body
[18:20] amen and brother brandom says that God
[18:23] hates hybrid religion he hates anything
[18:26] that can't reproduce itself amen
[18:30] hallelujah God could no longer live in
[18:32] that
[18:34] body because that body could not express
[18:38] deity somebody say Amen the flesh body
[18:41] brother Bram goes on to say that his
[18:43] channels of Faith got clogged yes he
[18:46] became unconscious of the fact of who he
[18:48] was because it was a hybrid
[18:51] body Now by The Sweat of his brow he had
[18:54] to go to work yes amen yes and time the
[18:59] pressure has he got more children the
[19:01] pressure came
[19:03] on and his channels of Faith got
[19:06] clogged
[19:08] hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen so
[19:11] we see here that the flesh body was
[19:14] corrupted So Adam lost the title deed
[19:17] the title deed to man's inheritance and
[19:19] his original Spirit left him the guy
[19:22] left him the spirit of Truth left him
[19:25] amen amen he lost the title deed to
[19:28] eternal life
[19:29] somebody say eternal life eternal life
[19:31] fellowship with God fellowship with God
[19:34] and power over the earth power over the
[19:36] Earth those are the three things that
[19:37] Adam lost but I'm going to jump ahead
[19:39] and tell you because of what Jesus
[19:41] Christ done amen he came to redeem man
[19:43] back to eternal life so if you believe
[19:46] on him like John 3:16 Says you shall
[19:48] have eternal life amen he came to
[19:50] restore Fellowship back with man through
[19:52] the shed Blood on the cross amen and
[19:55] power over the Earth is coming now to
[19:58] sons and Daughters of God who are being
[20:00] manifested according to Romans 8 amen
[20:03] now that the mysteries of the seventh
[20:04] seal are open they now can go and take
[20:07] possession of that scripture and become
[20:09] the manifested Sons and Daughters of God
[20:12] amen amen now we were saying that we
[20:14] know the seven seal scroll in Revelation
[20:17] 5 is the title deed to men's
[20:20] inheritance amen but in Revelation 5 we
[20:23] find it
[20:24] sealed how how did it get sealed
[20:29] amen we know Adam lost it but how did it
[20:31] get sealed so when man fell and was
[20:34] driven from the Garden of Eden God
[20:36] placed a seal over the title
[20:40] deed amen you want to put it up again
[20:42] you can read it Genesis
[20:44] 3:22 amen amen you are seeing how the
[20:47] book is being
[20:49] sealed now because it's there in a
[20:52] picture form don't misunderstand what
[20:55] God is
[20:56] doing he's Sealing the book when he's
[21:00] putting an
[21:02] angel you go to the maybe 24 when he's
[21:06] putting an angel to guide the way back
[21:08] he's sealing the book amen amen he's
[21:12] sealing the book to man's inheritance
[21:14] and who is he putting there he's putting
[21:16] an angel I'd say he's putting a mighty
[21:19] Angel Hallelujah I'd say one that can
[21:21] handle the Flaming sword amen he's
[21:25] putting an angel to seal that book amen
[21:27] hallelujah so is it anyone in Revelation
[21:29] 5 there's a strong Angel saying who is
[21:33] worthy to take this book and I'm seal
[21:37] the book amen praise the Lord amen amen
[21:40] so I man was separated by the seals can
[21:43] we say
[21:45] that yes the way back to the Tree of
[21:48] Life Angel was there the way from John
[21:52] going and taking the book what Was
[21:54] separating him the
[21:57] seals the seals was stopping John from
[22:00] taking back the book amen everybody
[22:03] agree amen so therefore we can say this
[22:07] that there can be no uniting without the
[22:09] breaking of the Seven Seals I'm trying
[22:11] to show you the importance of the Seven
[22:13] Seals this morning amen people wondering
[22:15] why the seals I'm here to declare the
[22:17] Seven Seals are for the sons of God the
[22:20] Seven Seals that come to unlock your
[22:22] amen your original position
[22:25] hallelujah amen don't let the Seven
[22:27] Seals be mysterious to you the Seven
[22:29] Seals are for Sons and Daughters of God
[22:32] thank
[22:33] amen so we have to see like brother Bram
[22:37] was say in that second seal Lord let
[22:39] them see their name beneath the
[22:41] seal so we have to see beneath the Seven
[22:44] Seals to see what we are uniting with
[22:48] because you can't take what you can't
[22:51] see the bride is not
[22:53] blind the bride is not like leans come
[22:56] on say Amen the bride is not blind amen
[23:01] our eyes of understanding has been
[23:02] opened to us unto us it is given to know
[23:05] the mysteries of the Kingdom amen amen
[23:07] so the gift of the Ephesian 4 minister
[23:10] is to raise you up so you can see
[23:12] beneath the seal oh yes you can see
[23:14] beyond the seal amen the message is
[23:16] about you Beyond Time amen hallelujah
[23:19] that is why the message of the hour
[23:21] reveals to you when you are in the back
[23:22] part of God's mind Before Time began and
[23:25] he also is taking into the future realm
[23:27] to show you out of time that you are
[23:29] Eternal being somebody say amen amen yes
[23:33] Lord amen amen
[23:35] hallelujah praise the Lord so we stand
[23:38] here this morning the Seven Seals have
[23:40] been broken by Christ through the
[23:41] prophetic gift and the fivefold ministry
[23:44] he here to release your inheritance that
[23:46] was locked under the seventh seal amen
[23:49] and your inheritance is the Holy Ghost
[23:51] yes if you don't get anything else in
[23:53] life get the Holy Ghost it's all you'll
[23:55] need in this life it's all you'll need
[23:57] out of this life
[23:59] hallelujah amen now where do we carry
[24:02] God's glory if if the flesh flesh realm
[24:05] is not redeemed yet where do we carry
[24:07] his
[24:09] glory God's glory we carry it with us in
[24:12] our spirit
[24:14] realm amen now we know the soul is the
[24:16] nature of the
[24:18] spirit
[24:21] Hallelujah so if you got a filthy Spirit
[24:24] we know the nature of your
[24:26] soul but if you've got a Godly spirit
[24:28] Spirit we know the nature of your soul
[24:30] amen amen praise the Lord so we carry
[24:34] the glory of God in our spirit realm
[24:37] when God gives Spirit Glory the glory of
[24:40] the spirit is seen in a
[24:43] body except that spirit is reflected in
[24:46] a body you can't see the glory of God
[24:49] yes right yes yes sir so I'm going to
[24:53] say the amount of Glory that you carry
[24:56] in the in your spirit determines your
[24:59] rank in the spirit amen people don't
[25:02] like to hear this but there's Rank and
[25:04] file in the kingdom of God they even put
[25:07] brother brandom elevated him and he
[25:10] asked but why did you put me here he
[25:12] says on Earth you are a prophet you
[25:14] given a special reward that's right amen
[25:17] hallelujah amen amen you don't like to
[25:19] hear it but it's true am therefore you
[25:21] can't recognize Authority in the kingdom
[25:23] of God that's right Amen in fact the
[25:24] Demonic World recognizes Authority more
[25:26] than some Christians do help us
[25:29] Lord hallelujah so the more your body is
[25:33] glorified the more ranking you have the
[25:36] more Glory you carry in your spirit
[25:38] thank you Lord you see some men so
[25:40] anointed so gifted they can walk up to a
[25:44] case Hallelujah they carry the glory of
[25:46] God one word and a demon leaves that
[25:49] body yes Lord
[25:51] amen amen amen carrying the glory of the
[25:55] spirit am amen that can take the word
[25:59] and go into the depths of the word and
[26:01] bring out Revelation am Amen to slay the
[26:04] enemy amen yes Lord that's rank in the
[26:06] spirit realm oh thank you a normal ly M
[26:09] don't have that same
[26:10] gifting
[26:12] Hallelujah and the prophet of God says
[26:15] not everyone carries the same anointing
[26:18] right Hallelujah but that's why we need
[26:19] the body together that's why we need the
[26:22] entire body functioning together but
[26:24] each one is operating under the
[26:25] different gifting each one is operating
[26:27] under different
[26:31] anointing amen before I go on I want to
[26:34] tell you something about this the this
[26:36] Chinese ticket the prophet of God tells
[26:38] us that in the old days before they had
[26:41] numbering system and the modern systems
[26:43] of
[26:45] today the Chinese came and set up their
[26:47] laundromats there and because they
[26:50] didn't want to confuse the laundry they
[26:52] would take a piece of paper and they
[26:54] would tear the piece of paper they would
[26:56] give you one off and they will keep one
[26:58] off they'll keep it with the clothing so
[27:01] when you come to redeem your clothing
[27:04] that two P pieces of got to match
[27:06] Hallelujah the tear has got to
[27:09] match that's how they knew it was your
[27:12] laundry right so there are two
[27:14] pieces hallelujah amen so pay attention
[27:18] to that I'll hit the lights highlight on
[27:20] that later amen praise the
[27:21] Lord so we want to see what ranking We
[27:24] Carry in the spirit
[27:27] realm hey amen amen and this is where
[27:30] amen we are to really
[27:32] labor amen because there can be no
[27:35] ranking in the spirit realm without a
[27:37] consecrated life without a spiritful
[27:40] life oh you say oh no don't worry
[27:43] brother as soon as I finish school I'll
[27:45] find time you are

[27:49] school if I can only leave College if I
[27:51] can only leave work I'll find more time
[27:53] you are lying
[27:59] amen amen or if you don't like that word
[28:01] you're speaking a
[28:04] mistruth praise the
[28:07] Lord because you will make the
[28:11] time if it was important to you
[28:14] yes
[28:15] amen oh no brother you know school work
[28:18] keeps me down and I can't get to do this
[28:20] you know my uh studies are getting me
[28:22] down I don't have much time you know my
[28:24] work is so busy
[28:26] no sons of of
[28:29] God who are operating in the spirit of
[28:32] God will
[28:35] sacrifice brother Brandon was also
[28:38] working he was a game warden he was
[28:41] collecting this electricity things
[28:43] connecting and cutting of people's
[28:45] electricity but how did what level did
[28:47] it
[28:49] operate hello Amen in fact Paul is
[28:52] telling Timothy to stir up the gift
[28:55] don't turn it down Hallelujah he said
[28:57] hey stir up the gift yes what's wrong
[28:59] with
[28:59] [Music]
[29:01] you am
[29:03] amen no but we we are so we are better
[29:06] than we're more
[29:07] anointed amen but in fact in reality if
[29:12] we are to put a measuring on your spirit
[29:14] realm and the glory you carry that thing
[29:16] won't even glow you know y they'll say
[29:19] next
[29:20] please next
[29:24] please now you can't fake this
[29:27] Hallelujah
[29:28] either lights up or not we are not
[29:32] talking natural things here amen natural
[29:34] things you can fake spiritual things you
[29:36] can't
[29:39] fake hallelujah amen therefore when
[29:42] somebody is sick somebody needs help
[29:44] somebody in trouble you better connect
[29:46] with a man of God
[29:48] amen amen you better connect with a man
[29:51] of God a man who's walking in the spirit
[29:53] who's not walking after the flesh don't
[29:56] care what the report is but is looking
[29:58] to the Unseen
[30:00] hallelujah what am I trying to tell you
[30:02] you better be finding a man who is
[30:04] connected with the angel of God
[30:11] Amen now you get some people in not
[30:14] might be saying you know get caral in
[30:15] the service oh BR you saying you
[30:16] connected with the angel of God well
[30:18] show me your connection with the angel
[30:19] of God hallelujah then we can have this
[30:23] conversation show me your connection
[30:25] with the angel of God
[30:30] you see why the denominational world is
[30:32] successful they're able to tap into the
[30:34] anointing of the man of
[30:37] God the prophet of God says you either
[30:39] believe your pastor or you don't believe
[30:41] him he says if you don't have faith in
[30:43] him he says you rather go find somebody
[30:44] else you can have confidence
[30:46] in amen praise the Lord amen so we are
[30:49] looking now to see that Lord we want to
[30:53] ascend the glory realm yes who can
[30:56] Ascend the hill of the Lord he that has
[30:58] Clean Hands and a pure heart amen so I'm
[31:00] going to ask you in a very basic way not
[31:02] to amen condemn you but to do spiritual
[31:05] Diagnostics very quickly how much time
[31:07] do you spend in prayer how much time do
[31:09] you read your Bible how much time do you
[31:11] fast how much time do you spend in his
[31:12] presence how much your longone time you
[31:16] got that will determine your right in
[31:18] the
[31:19] spirit
[31:20] amen no actually I meant to do that but
[31:24] there was a 2-hour Netflix
[31:26] movie satisfying the flesh I meant to do
[31:30] that but something else you you may be
[31:31] saying oh but why why must I do this yes
[31:36] you are not a natural being on the
[31:38] earth you and I are supernatural beings
[31:41] on the earth am
[31:45] hallelujah
[31:47] amen amen thank you Lord I ask you right
[31:51] now to just switch up the gear because
[31:55] right now when we're talking about
[31:57] levels in the spirit DM I can see his
[31:59] people and I'm not talking seeing you
[32:01] with my eyes I'm not looking at all of
[32:02] you I'm Looking Through The Eyes of the
[32:04] spirit right now and I can see some just
[32:07] sinking low they feel like they can't
[32:09] come up to this
[32:11] realm but you know what that is it's a
[32:14] spirit hanging over you listen to what I
[32:16] said it's not a spirit that possess you
[32:19] right it's a spirit hanging over you
[32:21] that telling you you can't reach this
[32:26] realm amen
[32:28] amen praise the
[32:30] Lord so we want to see how our spirit
[32:33] stands in God by the glory which this
[32:35] body
[32:36] carries God did not give us amen did not
[32:39] just give us a Celestial body God gave
[32:41] you a body that he himself dwells in God
[32:44] sent a prophet to reveal that body to us
[32:46] now you young people and those of you
[32:47] that never read it you all go and read
[32:50] the rejected King it's the first time
[32:52] the prophet is relating now why why
[32:54] would this be interesting to you let me
[32:55] tell you
[32:56] why science is probing for life outside
[33:00] of Earth that's right and they have not
[33:02] found
[33:04] it here is a
[33:07] documented
[33:08] reality the first time that a man left
[33:13] the Earth and went to another dimension
[33:17] amen and came back to tell us about it
[33:21] other mens have left this Dimension and
[33:22] went there like Enoch
[33:24] Elijah the first one that came back to
[33:28] give us an accurate account so you read
[33:30] the rejected King it's the first time he
[33:33] describes it then he further on he'll go
[33:35] and he'll preach beyond the curtain of
[33:37] time if you want to read about a man's
[33:40] experience of seeing the Unseen
[33:44] World amen how many will commit you'll
[33:47] commit to reading it commit commit amen
[33:49] no amen we'll commit raise your hands
[33:53] amen you know where to find it amen amen
[33:57] amen Google it the rejected King William
[34:00] brandham uh beyond the curtain of time
[34:04] William brandham you'll find it I know
[34:06] you like to
[34:09] search so for the next week stop
[34:12] searching for profiles and
[34:16] online search the message of the hour
[34:19] read about this other realm this world
[34:21] you know you'll be one of the few people
[34:23] that actually know about that
[34:25] world cuz the others reject
[34:28] Hallelujah so God gave adam a body that
[34:31] didn't carry much glory amen what you
[34:34] have now is ibr I'm talking about after
[34:36] the fall you have a body now that
[34:37] depletes in glory you'll find as we grow
[34:40] older the beauty of young men is in
[34:42] their youth the Bible
[34:44] says amen but as you get old Your Glory
[34:48] depletes we live now in a body whose
[34:51] Glory di diminishes every day every day
[34:55] the glory of this flesh is depart
[34:58] but yet in our spirit we are renewed
[35:00] daily the Bible
[35:02] says amen we were once I'm saying we
[35:06] once a handsome young
[35:09] man now watch as you get old Your Glory
[35:12] depletes so we live in a body that's
[35:15] going old the outward man
[35:17] perishes at a certain age you can't even
[35:20] sustain healing
[35:21] anymore you know
[35:24] that yeah your body your organs just
[35:27] shut down what is that Ecclesiastes 3
[35:29] every everything there's a time and
[35:30] season a time to be born a time to die
[35:33] so yes we can pray for you you can be
[35:35] healed but once we come to that
[35:37] point where it's your time we can't pray
[35:41] that
[35:41] away to everything there's a season the
[35:45] prophet of God says if you're here if
[35:48] you alive you are here to fulfill God's
[35:49] purpose when your purpose is finished
[35:51] God will take you away amen so remember
[35:55] that so one day don't come now and
[35:56] you're dying breath and say you failed
[35:59] no it's your time to
[36:01] go you know when we're praying for you
[36:04] don't say ah Pastor see now I'm going no
[36:07] it's your time to go don't worry don't
[36:09] be scared to go there's a body waiting
[36:12] for you you won't float around like a
[36:14] ghost you can enter a more glorious
[36:18] body praise the
[36:20] Lord
[36:25] amen so what we are saying is this seven
[36:27] seal opened up this realm to us and if
[36:30] we if we must have continuity if we must
[36:33] have eternal life then the word of God
[36:34] must provide a body because no matter
[36:37] how sincere you are in your spirit and
[36:39] in your soul that attribute inside of
[36:42] your soul can't find expression in this
[36:44] ibrid body you what I'm saying that's
[36:47] right the C Gene of God within you can
[36:50] only find certain amount of expression
[36:53] through this body that's why it's
[36:55] longing for another body so we can have
[36:57] it full expression amen because in this
[37:00] body even though now you're filled with
[37:01] the glory of God even though now you're
[37:03] filled with the Holy Ghost you can't
[37:04] walk through a
[37:06] wall hello you need a glorified body for
[37:11] the attribute to have full expression
[37:13] yes amen So Adam had the Book of Life in
[37:15] his hand and God told Adam to
[37:18] multiply and replenish the Earth but the
[37:21] Bible says Adam was
[37:24] naked and he was not yet glorified
[37:27] because because he bypassed his theop
[37:30] body
[37:31] yes Adam had to grow in the likeness of
[37:34] God to a place of glorification the seed
[37:36] jeene the Son of God because brother
[37:38] Bram says Adam was a seed Son of God and
[37:41] any seed is not in its mature form
[37:44] meaning that Adam being a seed Son of
[37:46] God had to grow up
[37:48] Hallelujah even Jesus he says was a seed
[37:51] Son of God but Jesus grew in stature in
[37:54] the sight of God and Men the Bible says
[37:57] praise the Lord amen so the book of life
[38:00] was not supposed to come through a flesh
[38:02] body we ordained to come from a Theon
[38:05] body that is what we were ordained to do
[38:08] but but now you came your your seed Gene
[38:11] came through a flesh
[38:12] body it was not meant to be like that
[38:15] Adam could not bring the names in the
[38:17] book by the spoken word except to be be
[38:19] clothed with a glorified
[38:22] body amen so we find the sons of God in
[38:25] the book which to come by Spoken Word so
[38:28] you would have been a glorified son yes
[38:30] but what happened is had the been no
[38:33] fall God wouldn't have been able to
[38:35] express his attributes but God wanted
[38:38] the fall because it's more glorious when
[38:40] you come to glory after the fall amen
[38:42] when God can take you and redeem you and
[38:45] and make you a son and daughter of God
[38:47] it is more glorious to God
[38:50] Amen think of it the other way brother
[38:52] Bram says he won't push you through a
[38:54] pipe and take you to the other side and
[38:55] say Well done my son you made it so it
[38:58] is more glorious to God to make you to
[39:02] redeem you after the fall praise the
[39:05] Lord now we know that Eve couldn't wait
[39:06] for the promise there was an official
[39:08] season that was coming upon them where
[39:10] Adam could have had the spoken word and
[39:12] he could have called the names in the
[39:14] book Adam had the mind of Christ so he
[39:16] could have called the names in the book
[39:18] but Eve his bride couldn't wait for Adam
[39:21] to grow up into that realm
[39:24] amen So Adam went to Redeemer and he
[39:27] fell and when he fell he was clothed
[39:30] with different skins now he came with
[39:32] animal
[39:33] skins so we know that our first
[39:35] revelation of what kind of body was what
[39:37] kind of body Adam had we know we've been
[39:39] through that he could speak he could
[39:41] speak the first body that he
[39:44] had amen now you and I even though like
[39:47] we were saying wedes day we are Body
[39:50] Spirit and soul right so we have a a
[39:53] flesh body a redeemed body we have a
[39:55] theop body and we have a glorified body
[39:59] praise the Lord not three different
[40:00] bodies but three dimensions of the same
[40:03] body am thank you Lord praise the Lord
[40:08] amen now you are sitting
[40:12] here but there's another version of
[40:16] you
[40:18] yes yes sir yes every one of you sitting
[40:22] here there's another version of you yes
[40:26] amen praise the Lord amen another body
[40:29] that you have not yet seen because it's
[40:32] hidden under the seventh
[40:33] seal
[40:35] amen
[40:38] hallelujah praise the Lord put Matthew
[40:41] 18:10 there brother Bram broke the seal
[40:44] so you can have a view and see the rest
[40:46] of your Dimensions amen so you are a
[40:49] dimensional being yes oh yes you are
[40:51] sitting here in a flesh body amen but
[40:53] there's another part of you in that
[40:55] sixth dimension
[40:59] here they coming
[41:00] to for the children and our Lord is
[41:03] telling them take heed that you despise
[41:05] not one of these little ones for I say
[41:07] unto you that in heaven their Angels oh
[41:11] yes now if you go and search that out in
[41:12] the message the prophet is saying they
[41:15] Celestial body they theop body do always
[41:19] behold the face of My Father which is in
[41:22] heaven so yeah were the children
[41:23] literally on Earth but Jesus is saying
[41:26] that they Angels do always behold the
[41:28] face of my

[41:33] body amen hallelujah amen I thought that
[41:38] would excite you

[41:42] says if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[41:44] dissolved we already have one waiting
[41:46] yes right amen so you're sitting here

[41:51] another dimension another body that you
[41:53] have not seen But brother Brandon broke
[41:55] the seal so you can view the rest of
[41:57] your dimensions and when you live those
[41:59] Dimensions you really know that you are
[42:01] just like Abraham his body
[42:07] changed God did not give Abraham another
[42:10] body right oh yes
[42:13] Hallelujah he had the same body but he
[42:16] changed back to a young man amen that
[42:18] means Abraham connected to the other
[42:20] dimension of his body that was always
[42:23] there that means Enoch connected with
[42:25] another dimension of his body body that
[42:27] was always there am Hallelujah am amen
[42:32] that means brother Brandon when he's
[42:34] transitioning and he's leaving the body
[42:36] he said I was here in the stopy body but
[42:39] I looked back and I saw the other part
[42:42] the other dimension of me I saw myself
[42:45] lying on the bed yes hello yes there is
[42:48] another dimension of you Amen brother
[42:51] brandom says that you are connected with
[42:53] your theophany when you hear the message
[42:55] of the hour you are hearing from
[42:57] theophany yes that's why we sing that
[42:59] song Can't You Hear Your theophany
[43:01] calling you amen you see while I'm
[43:03] preaching now there's a gene of God
[43:06] either telling you I have representation
[43:08] in what you are

[43:12] that we shall be changed amen tell
[43:14] somebody we shall be changed tell your
[43:16] neighbor we shall be changed we shall be

[43:50] God the genealogy of God brother Brandon
[43:54] was calling your names he was calling
[43:56] the names in the book Amen to show you
[43:59] where you came from lord your journey on
[44:02] Earth and where you're going
[44:04] to amen the part that we see is just a
[44:07] small part we got 7080 years and we
[44:11] Rejoice around that but there's eternity
[44:14] that awaits
[44:15] Us Praise the Lord there's a larger part
[44:18] held in eternity right now a theop
[44:22] body in fact if your theop body was here
[44:25] right now all doubt all Fe all reasoning
[44:28] you'll be back in your original
[44:29] condition
[44:30] again thank you Lord until you connect
[44:34] with that body you can't be changed yes
[44:37] changing is not bringing something new
[44:40] changing means you're becoming something
[44:42] else right amen hallelujah you are now
[44:45] baptized with your original Spirit can I
[44:47] see those that are baptized with the
[44:48] Holy Spirit but the Holy Ghost is taking
[44:51] you back to your original condition your
[44:53] Original Seed your original word your
[44:56] original to be conditioned amen amen
[45:00] original like your
[45:02] father you're becoming like your
[45:05] father now very quickly in Revelation
[45:08] chapter 5 John brother Grom says was
[45:11] raised up to see another
[45:14] John yes and we showed you in the
[45:17] scripture how those Elders John was one
[45:19] of those Elders yes right the John was
[45:22] raised up and John saw another version
[45:25] of himself yes amen
[45:29] you saying where you getting this from
[45:30] Seven seal Frontiers have been opened
[45:33] up Frontiers have been opened up to us
[45:36] you may be thinking what are you doing
[45:37] right now I am obliterating Satan's
[45:40] kingdom by positioning you into see has
[45:43] you were know amen I am bringing
[45:45] Revelation to you because there's no
[45:47] prevailing power is the power of
[45:49] Revelation yes
[45:51] yes praise the Lord amen what am I doing
[45:55] I'm giving you muscles to flex
[45:57] so when Satan comes to you can tell him
[45:58] do you know who I am I don't only have
[46:01] representation on the Earth right now I
[46:03] have representation in heaven in fact
[46:05] Satan you are kicked out of
[46:07] heaven amen
[46:10] GL thank you Lord so John is raised up
[46:13] to see another version of
[46:16] John brother Bram is raised up to see
[46:18] another version of himself
[46:22] Hallelujah but the John the same John
[46:26] that's
[46:27] looking there's a dividing
[46:30] line what is that dividing line the
[46:34] seals the seals are dividing him from
[46:36] John yes amen amen that's right so
[46:40] before 63 you were divided from knowing
[46:44] who you really are oh yes Lord amen
[46:47] praise the Lord separated by the seals
[46:50] but just beyond the seals he saw the
[46:52] other part of John am he wants to
[46:55] connect with John but but he can't
[46:58] because there's no one worthy to break
[46:59] the
[47:01] seals now notice he didn't call that
[47:05] part by another
[47:07] name he didn't call that Joseph he
[47:11] didn't call that part Moses but he said
[47:15] John saw John
[47:18] am amen same John but in two
[47:23] Dimensions maybe you thinking this is
[47:25] two outet this sounds like Star Wars yes
[47:28] Amen in fact you know they they uh copy
[47:33] these things in the movies yeah what
[47:34] they call it multi-dimensional galaxies
[47:37] that's right Two Worlds or whatever yeah
[47:41] different galaxies or in the same same
[47:44] person in different I I can't remember
[47:46] the name now amen so John is trapped in
[47:49] time and he can't get over to the other
[47:52] John because the real John the Holy
[47:54] Ghost John the theophany John is
[47:57] separated by the seals amen so the lamb
[48:00] has to break the seals and the breaking
[48:02] of the seals amen you know brother
[48:04] brandom says there's a breach between
[48:06] the church ages and the Seven Seals yes
[48:09] yes that's
[48:11] right now you can stand on the bridge in
[48:14] fact the Seven Seals creates a
[48:16] bridge come on the Seven Seals creates a
[48:20] bridge so you can connect with the other
[48:22] part of you amen your theophonic part
[48:25] your original part amen praise the Lord
[48:27] tell somebody I am
[48:29] original amen amen amen hallelujah
[48:34] brother like original parts amen praise
[48:37] the lord we don't like hybrid Parts some
[48:40] people like fake Parts some people like
[48:43] pirate Parts you can't put a pirate part
[48:46] in the body of
[48:47] Christ
[48:49] amen
[48:50] amen now you know when a when a hbd mule
[48:53] dies that mule cannot breed itself to
[48:55] its original breed
[48:57] it's original pedigree amen so your
[49:00] breed is the is your pure state in the
[49:03] word of God yes your breed amen
[49:06] hallelujah amen can reproduce itself
[49:09] amen
[49:11] Faith than
[49:13] you so how do I get back the answer is
[49:17] in the seals it's over there I can see
[49:19] it but how do you bring it back John is
[49:22] crying how do I bring it back how do I
[49:26] connect with to
[49:28] John how do you bring it back because
[49:30] sin had separated me God Made A Way and
[49:34] he saw himself but he couldn't bring
[49:36] himself back he saw himself and he says
[49:39] oh mama that's me thank
[49:42] amen praise the Lord you see John
[49:46] recognizing himself he's like that eagle
[49:49] and he says mama that's
[49:51] me I'm driving a point here now to close
[49:54] so how do I bring it back how do I
[49:56] connect with that body so that I can
[49:58] reign as a king and priest on the earth
[50:00] come back to my original
[50:02] image amen man can't get to the other
[50:05] side but the theophany body could not
[50:07] come here as well God had to make a way
[50:09] through the cross and through the
[50:10] opening of The Seven Seals so the Seven
[50:13] Seals now becomes the bridge that for
[50:15] over 60 years the seals are open and
[50:18] there is a passage way thank you I'm
[50:20] telling you we are moving thank you Lord
[50:22] I'm telling you that the church has not
[50:23] been stagnant I'm telling you that we
[50:25] have been on the passage
[50:27] the Seven Seals have been leading us to
[50:29] our Eternal Body yes amen because the
[50:32] other part of you amen was hidden away
[50:34] from you but God took you through the
[50:36] prophetic eye the eye of William Brandon
[50:38] and he raised you to a level to see
[50:41] another spiritual froner open up a
[50:43] dimensional door so you can see past the
[50:46] curtain of time and see the real you yes
[50:48] Lord amen how names were hidden under
[50:51] the seventh seal we were separated but
[50:53] in 1963 God gave brother Bram the
[50:56] authority uity to reveal those seals
[50:58] amen the one that the lamb revealed in
[51:01] simple form is now given the authority
[51:04] to reveal it in Revelation form to
[51:06] reveal the other part of you what am I
[51:09] saying amen there is one part of the
[51:11] Chinese ticket here but the other part
[51:13] of the Chinese ticket is on the other
[51:15] side and when you can put those two
[51:17] together you shall get a glorified body
[51:20] somebody give God praise amen amen yes
[51:25] Lord thank you one part of the Chinese
[51:27] ticket is here where's the other part I
[51:30] want to go back to the other part why

[52:14] unsealed amen hallelujah the seals are
[52:17] broken meaning there's no more
[52:19] separation meaning that if this was 1963
[52:23] we are here now in 2024 maybe you're
[52:25] thinking that we are just in the same
[52:27] position as brother Bram left we are not
