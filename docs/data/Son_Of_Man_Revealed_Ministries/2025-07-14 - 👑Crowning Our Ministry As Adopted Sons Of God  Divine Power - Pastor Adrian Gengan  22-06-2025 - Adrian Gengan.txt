TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. Everyone in the mighty powerful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Rachel brothers and sisters say you're welcome into the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Everybody feeling good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Romesh is not sure. He's in Johannesburg. He left on Friday and he'll be coming back on witness day. Amen. He's going to spend some time with his children. So we pray that the Lord will bless him. Amen. And give him a good time there. Amen. Was your neighbor well? &gt;&gt; Amen. Ask Turn to them and ask them where were you on Wednesday? What did they tell you? Tell them I expect to see you here on Wednesday. Amen. We need to hold one another accountable. Praise the Lord. Everyone feeling good? Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles even as we go into our scripture this morning and our our message this morning. We've been speaking on crowning our ministry as adopted sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you remember, we took divine nature. We took divine character. This morning, we look at divine power. &gt;&gt; G. Amen. Because nature comes from the seed gene that God placed within us. &gt;&gt; And once we allow the Holy Spirit to germinate that seed gene to life, the nature of God comes on display. &gt;&gt; And out of the nature comes character. &gt;&gt; I will uh review some of the character this morning just to background a bit to show you that character you can't pray for character. &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift. It can't be given to you. Character is developed through your daily experiences. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says character is a victory. &gt;&gt; Now he says when we have divine character then the power that's locked up within us by the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; can now be utilized and your foot to rule &gt;&gt; rule with that power &gt;&gt; in God's kingdom. Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles. We'll go to second Peter chapter uh one. Praise the Lord. Let's read from verse three. According as his divine power, now divine is not a natural power, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; According as his divine power hath given unto us all things. Hey, somebody reading with me. &gt;&gt; His divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I've got to believe I've already received all things that I desire. Amen. &gt;&gt; His divine power has released it to me through the knowledge of him that had called us unto glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue. Amen. I'm not going to read all of that. You know that I was focusing on the divine power and the divine nature. We'll go to 2 Timothy chapter 1. Praise the Lord. 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 says, "For God had not given us the spirit of fear." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is imparting of himself. But God does not have fear within him. &gt;&gt; So he's not given us the spirit of fear, &gt;&gt; but of power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Which means power is a spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we reading correctly? &gt;&gt; He's not given us a spirit of fear, but he's given us a spirit of power &gt;&gt; and of love. Love is a spirit &gt;&gt; and a sound mind. To be in sound mind is a spirit. And I'm telling you that that is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To have the Holy Spirit is to have power. &gt;&gt; Is to have love and is to have a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word. We pray Lord that you the author will take the word and break it into our hearts now. Bless the hearer of the word. We commit the service into your hands. We pray Lord the needs of the people be met as your word is preached. We ask your blessings in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May be seated. How many of you know what overtime is? What extra time is. Amen. I believe we're in extra time. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're in the closing stages of the Gentile dispensation. &gt;&gt; What that means more plainly is that God is fixing to end his work with the Gentiles &gt;&gt; and he's planning to go back to the Jews &gt;&gt; under a Moses and Elijah ministry. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So under Moses and Elijah ministry, &gt;&gt; there is no more repentance for the Gentiles. They will have to go through the tribulation. &gt;&gt; And I want you to also tell you there will be no repentance once the rapture is taking place or once you are dead. &gt;&gt; You can't repent in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If if our lives need to be made right, it needs to be made right now. Yes. &gt;&gt; If we are fooling around or messing around with the word, it needs to be made right now before &gt;&gt; the Lord closes the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you read Matthew 25, when he closed the door, they come banging on the door. &gt;&gt; And the door is not open. There's no more grace. &gt;&gt; There's no more favor being poured out. &gt;&gt; Right now, while his grace and favor is being poured out, &gt;&gt; we are to get into the hack of safety. &gt;&gt; And let me ask you this. If Jesus was to come tomorrow, what changes in your life would you have to make? If Jesus was coming tomorrow between 6:00 and 9, what changes would you have to make? What repenting would you have to do? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if and if there are things there that are there that we need to sort out, I say let's sort it out this morning. &gt;&gt; I say let's not leave it for another day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because no man know the hour or the day that Jesus will come back. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So like I say, we are over time. &gt;&gt; We're in extra time, which means the clock is ticking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The clock is winding down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we are looking at divine nature, out of divine nature is coming a divine character. And out of divine character is coming a divine power. And out of divine power, you shall see the glory of God in sons and daughters of of God. Again, &gt;&gt; standing like Adam stood for the glory of God within him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we know that the prerequisite for power is character. &gt;&gt; In order for charact for power to be used correctly, Holy Ghost power, the prerequisite is character. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God has been working to mold our character. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God has been working and molding and shaping our character. God has been training us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we mustn't despise the the training of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brley is saying here where wherefore if the power which is in the church as received by divine appointment it is due season. &gt;&gt; So there's a power coming into the church in due season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you as well that there was no other age &gt;&gt; where the church has come to marriage &gt;&gt; or no other age where the church came to adoption. Hallelujah. I'm going to say it again. &gt;&gt; The Ephesian church age was not adopted. &gt;&gt; Smy church age change, Titeria church age change, all seven church ages were not adopted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be adopted is to come back into Adam condition which means you have eternal life and you shall never die. I know where your mind is going. Your mind's going to Paul. Surely Paul was adopted. But did Paul die? Yes. &gt;&gt; I say there's coming a people who shall receive adoption, full adoption, where they shall not see death. &gt;&gt; There shall be like Enoch walked. &gt;&gt; Where he shall take a translation. &gt;&gt; So no other church age could come into marriage except in this end time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because the bride the bride had to be called out. &gt;&gt; The bride had to be elected. The bride had to be chosen. But up until then, the groom was not here on the earth. &gt;&gt; So, how could the marriage have taken place? &gt;&gt; The groom was not here in the Ephesian church age. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you read the church, seven church ages in Revelation chapter 2, you'll see all the time he's saying, "Lest I come. Lest I come, lest I come." It's only in the seven church age, the bridegroom comes down and he's standing at the door and he's knocking. And when that door is asking to be opened, he's asking for a door of marriage to be opened. &gt;&gt; But they refuse to open the door to him. &gt;&gt; So he's going to call out a people out of the age and pull them into the headstone. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to understand we are not living in the seven church age. We are right up there in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Leosia is trapped in that seven church age. The prophet messenger was sent to the Leadyian church age. He's a messenger to the Leosian church age. But the seventh angel was sent to the headstone people. &gt;&gt; You can't be formed into the headstone and be so alike like Jesus where the stone you can't tell the difference between the bride and the groom where the headstone. This is the headstone ministry. Which means we needed Elijah the prophet in this age and we needed a seventh angel to reveal the mystery of God. And when the mystery of God is being revealed, that's the door of marriage being opened to an end time people. &gt;&gt; The door of marriage because God wants to reveal himself. That's why the mystery of God is revealed. &gt;&gt; And you would know that when God is revealing the mystery, he is not revealing the mystery of the groom alone. &gt;&gt; Because man was made in the image of God, male and female created in them. So you can't only have a male version of God yet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's come back in this time and season so that the masculine and feminine spirit can be united together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to read this here to just background what we were saying. I reckon the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in another brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Where's the glory in us? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Unless we suffer with him, we cannot reign with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know them that overcome that seven church age. He says, if you overcome this age, I'll make you rule and reign with me on my throne. &gt;&gt; But he says, unless we suffer with him, we cannot reign with him. &gt;&gt; You have to suffer to reign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Character is a victory. &gt;&gt; Not a gift. &gt;&gt; I say again, you can't come to the front and say, "Pastor, please pray for good character. &gt;&gt; Character is not imparted. &gt;&gt; Character is is not given. &gt;&gt; Character is shaped and molded. &gt;&gt; A man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic." &gt;&gt; Look at what's happening. If you can type up there. Amen. Maybe you type it up. Real false prophet. &gt;&gt; Who's got a phone here? Brother Caleb, you got your phone on you. I want you to Google what's a sports name. Real name now, not Leo, right? You you find that quote now. Let's finish reading this quote. It says, "But power with character is fit to rule. So God has been molding and shaping our character. But our rulership doesn't start &gt;&gt; when we leave here. &gt;&gt; Our rulership must start now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now are we the sons and daughters of God? &gt;&gt; Now are we taking back? &gt;&gt; Now are we having dominion? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Surprised to see brother Nathaniel here. God bless you. Did you welcome brother Nathaniel? Amen. Let's welcome him. Praise the Lord. That's going to show his son. Amen. Praise the Lord. Did we find it? Real false prophet. Did you find it? Okay, let's go here and see. This is just an observation, people. Observation. Hear what the prophet of God is saying. He says, "The ages come in with false prophets and they will go out with false prophets." Now, of course, there's going to be a real false prophet &gt;&gt; with the Caleb. What's his name? So what's his initials? &gt;&gt; RPL. &gt;&gt; Is that a coincidence? &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb, say his name out loud again. &gt;&gt; Robert Francis. &gt;&gt; Post. &gt;&gt; Robert Francis. &gt;&gt; Preost. &gt;&gt; But the prophet is saying there will come a real false prophet. And this guy's initials is RFP. &gt;&gt; I say it's not a coincidence. &gt;&gt; He's a real provost. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So observe that. And he says since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and he sat down in his father's throne, then we have to overcome to sit with him. And the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes. Or what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Here he says, "Think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that will try you. Is it strange that God wants to develop our Christlike character that comes through suffering?" No, sir. And we all have trials. We all have to be tried and chasing the sun. Not one goes out through that. But through that, the church that is not suffering and is not being tried as God. It isn't of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a power that's been released to the church. &gt;&gt; Sometimes things can be released to us and we are not conscious of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. or we are not sufficiently impressed with what we have and we are looking for something else. &gt;&gt; Right now we are in the cycle of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The headstone has come down with a shout. &gt;&gt; When you see that cloud picture, that is not an ordinary picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was Christ on Sunset Mountain. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This was Christ on Sunset Mountain. This was the headstone coming to unite with the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not here to preach just ABCs. I'm here to preach algebra as well. &gt;&gt; Me, I'm a very qualified teacher. I can preach ABCs and I can preach algebra. &gt;&gt; I'm not like your teachers at school where they're only teaching Africans. They can't teach you another subject. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the message of the hour that came when the mighty angel came down was to give us rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can preach all kinds of faith, but that's not what's going to translate us in this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The kind of faith that's needed now is perfect faith. &gt;&gt; And perfect faith can only be preached by the revelation of the word. So we've got to understand the deeper things as well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can show you Adam. Do you know that Adam could speak to nature? &gt;&gt; Pull up Matthew 17:20. Then &gt;&gt; how many of you know Ma uh Adam could speak to nature? &gt;&gt; Adam could speak to the winds. &gt;&gt; Adam could speak to the ways. How many of you would say, "What faith is that?" Somebody tell me, "What kind of faith is that?" &gt;&gt; What kind of faith is that? &gt;&gt; Amen. How about if I told you that wasn't perfect faith? That that was a measure of faith. Because if you put up Matthew 17:20 there, I'll show you by what authority Adam was operating by because he was growing to the mature state of the word. He was coming up to be like Melzdc. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam was moving mountains. &gt;&gt; Let's read. If you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, "Remove from here ends to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible to you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What kind of faith did Adam have? &gt;&gt; Hey, are we reading Bible yet? What kind of faith did Adam have? &gt;&gt; With just mustard seed faith, he was moving mountains. He was speaking to winds. &gt;&gt; He was speaking to nature. &gt;&gt; He was controlling the animals with mustard seed faith. &gt;&gt; But he had to have the faith of Melzdc. And he was growing up into the stage. &gt;&gt; But Eve couldn't wait for him to receive perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Because while he possessed the power to speak to mountains, while he possessed the power to speak to winds and to speak to waves, he didn't have the power of creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; He didn't. He was still growing up into the image of Melazedc where he could go to him. You shall have a son &gt;&gt; and his name shall be called Abel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was still developing the creative power. &gt;&gt; But he was a son of God because remember go read Genesis 1:27 again. In the image of God created he them. God left out the the likeness. Genesis 1:26, he says, "I'll create them in my image and likeness." &gt;&gt; When he finally creates them, he says, "In the image of God created in them." Likeness is missing. So, which means Adam had to grow from faith. &gt;&gt; Mustard seed faith &gt;&gt; to virtue, to knowledge, to temperance, to patience, to godliness, to brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But while he was coming up into the likeness of God to stand there in the image because remember Mazdc is the perfect state of the word &gt;&gt; and Adam was a spoken seed word &gt;&gt; son of God. &gt;&gt; So he was coming up to maturity. Is is everybody understanding this? &gt;&gt; Amen. I just proved it to you by scripture Matthew 17:20 that being able to speak to mountains speak to wind where nothing shall be impossible to you. You only need mustard seed faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But to have creative power &gt;&gt; to be able to speak spirits into existence &gt;&gt; requires mazes kind of faith. &gt;&gt; And that is what we are after right now. &gt;&gt; We are not wanting wishy-washy kind of faith here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you how many of you mothers here that cook, you seen what a mustard seed is? I was actually going to bring some mustard seeds &gt;&gt; and give you one mustard seed because Jesus said if you have the faith of a mustard seed, not 10 mustard seeds, right? &gt;&gt; And I was going to give it to you and make you hold it in your hand and ask you at the end of the service if you still have it because I guarantee you that thing would have been lost. &gt;&gt; It's hard to hold on to mustard seed faith. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring it next week for you. Show me your mustard seed at the end of the service or see if you fumbled it. &gt;&gt; So mustard seed faith won't sustain us in this time and season. &gt;&gt; Come on, we need to read perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Jesus lived in a word unto himself. &gt;&gt; Jesus was able to speak. Amen. Because he had the Amen. the fullness of the Godhead living within him. &gt;&gt; Now you and I don't possess the fullness of the Godhead individually. We have a portion of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you can say testify to that? &gt;&gt; We've seen the closest we've seen to the fullness of the God and in a man was in the seventh angel was in Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; He was a son of man revealing this son of man. [Music] &gt;&gt; But after he left, the Holy Ghost was sent out in portions. Yes. &gt;&gt; So which means if I want the Holy Ghost to be more powerful, &gt;&gt; I need to connect with the Holy Ghost in you. &gt;&gt; Because just one of us can put a thousand to flight. &gt;&gt; But two of us can send a legion fleeing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says if two or more agree upon any touching anything, &gt;&gt; it shall be given. So I've got to connect with another member of the body and another member of the body and another member of the body. And as we are connecting, the Holy Ghost power is getting stronger. Divine power is getting stronger. That's why this body is fully framed and we cannot do without one another. &gt;&gt; That's why we can't project ourselves as the man of this person. Amen. We've got to realize we need one another and we cannot operate independently. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you know what we are carrying within us now? I was telling you that we are carrying the power of the shout. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has come with a shout. He does all three things as descending. &gt;&gt; So he's here now in the power of the shout. &gt;&gt; The power of the shout is to call you out of denominations. The power of the shout is to call you out of religions. The power of the shout is to call you out of man-made religions and to pull you into heavenly places where Jesus Christ is sitting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same power that was in Jesus is the same power that's in you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen now. We are carrying the power of the shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the shout to us? It's a message going forth to gather the living saints. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are gathering the living saints. When we are prophesying and calling somebody into the into the truth, the revealed truth of this day, we are using the power of the shout. &gt;&gt; I say that we know how to operate the power of the shout. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was teaching me, not me, was teaching at Wright how to use the power of the shout. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to know how to access the power of the shout. &gt;&gt; There are certain powers that you need to know how to harness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to know how to use it. You need to know how to control it. But the shout is the message. Amen. Is the living bread of life. And bread must be given to people who are starving. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is called the living bread of life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you can give bread to the hungry. &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you, I'm going give you a couple examples, maybe just three. You can use the power of the shout to go after your lost fallen brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The power of the shout is what made Abraham go and rescue Lot. &gt;&gt; He was carrying a message. &gt;&gt; He was carrying a message of blessing. He was carrying a message of you shall have a son. &gt;&gt; He was carrying a message of I'll make you a great nation. He was carrying this message. But this message that he was carrying had a power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when time came that he needed to access this power, he told his trained servants, let's go after lot. &gt;&gt; Which means that we are carrying the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's a power in the message of the hour that we can unlock to go after our lost fallen brothers. Amen. You can also go maybe your your family member right now is not here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Somebody get this and somebody access doors that are opening right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mother went to Mary who was trapped in a house of mourning. &gt;&gt; Her brother had died. She's there trapped with denominational people in there in a house of mourning &gt;&gt; backslidden. But Martha uses the power of the shout &gt;&gt; to go to Mary and say, "The master has come and call it for thee." She pulls her out of that situation. She pulls her out of the house of morning. I say even now, you've got to be able to use the power that's laying in the message of the hour to pull your loved ones out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The problem is we have too many conservative message believers. We need some radical message believers. Amen. Who are not ashamed to take God at his word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, try the power one time. I say even right now while you are sitting there, call your loved ones name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pull them out. There's a power right now. What I'm speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? The message is a living word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a living word, which means when living word is released by the lips of faith, it's got to bring it back. The word can't return void. Call your loved ones now. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just showed you how Abraham brought back Lot. &gt;&gt; I showed you how Martha brought back Mary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Using the power of the shout. And where did she bring her? She brought her to the voice of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. She brought her to show her that he had now moved past the shout. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And the voice of the resurrection was on the scene getting ready to call out sleeping Lazarus. &gt;&gt; So you've got to go with a message of urgency. &gt;&gt; Your message is urgent. Hey, you're going to miss the shout. You're not going to make the rapture. &gt;&gt; So Martha goes to call Mary and says, "Come out." &gt;&gt; What's the matter with you? Why you going back to denomination? Why you backsliding in the house of mourning? Come where Jesus is. Amen. &gt;&gt; She made it in the nick of time to where Jesus was ready there for the power of the show. But it was transitioning now to the voice of the resurrection. And Jesus says to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. I speak a word over you, your loved one, though they are dead in denomination, though they are dead in their sins right now. By the power of the spoken word, I call him. I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And if he live, he shall never die. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Auntie Wright was talking to the prophet. &gt;&gt; And she was the first one to hear the testimony of the squirrels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But a testimony is not to puff up somebody. &gt;&gt; If you're ever going to use a testimony, is there to encourage the next person &gt;&gt; to tell them such as I have received, give I unto you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The power, the words of a son of God in this time and seasons, I give it to you. &gt;&gt; And the prophet was sitting there telling her about this hunting experience and how he was hunting and there was no squirrels. &gt;&gt; And the Lord told him, "Didn't you come here to hunt?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Yes, Lord, but there's no squirrels." He says, "Well, why don't you speak the squirrel into existence?" &gt;&gt; Creative power is laying in sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're saying it's not so. How did Elijah speak a word over this woman that her oil and a meal didn't run dry? &gt;&gt; Hey, we are not ordinary people. &gt;&gt; We are packed with power, &gt;&gt; divine power, not man-made power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak to your situation. Speak to your finances. Speak to your bad dry covered. Speak to barren homes. Amen. You are carrying the power of the shout. Amen. And open the door this morning. Open the door this morning. In fact, if you don't want to open the door this morning, the Holy Spirit is here to break down every door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Because time and season has come where you've got to know the power that we are carrying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We can't be living mediocre lives. We were not called to live mediocre lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, at right, the children are not saved right there when she agreed with what the prophet says. The prophet says God spoke out of her heart. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; He says ask what you will. He says I thought about it. You can also think about it right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see all of you didn't realize you were agreeing with the word all this time that I've been preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same atmosphere ate was under. &gt;&gt; She was agreeing with the prophet's word. &gt;&gt; All of youall have been agreeing with my word. &gt;&gt; Amen. under the same atmosphere and the same conditions. &gt;&gt; You can speak and call your loved one. &gt;&gt; They were not saved. She says, "I desire." There was a sister in a wheelchair. &gt;&gt; But she says, "Oh, Edith is old now. Even if she comes out of a wheelchair, there's not much benefit in her being healed out of that wheelchair right now. Even though it seemed like the humane thing to do, uh, you're a poor woman, auntie. Why don't you speak and ask for a suitcase of money? In this in this age that we live in, most people will be tempted to do that. &gt;&gt; As I was sharing with you a few weeks ago, there is one thing that you can take with you from this life to the next. You can't take money, you can't take cars, &gt;&gt; you can't take houses, &gt;&gt; but you can do what did &gt;&gt; she took her children from this life &gt;&gt; to the next life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; She said, "I desire the salvation of my two boys." &gt;&gt; So teach them from a young age about Jesus. &gt;&gt; Tell them about why Jesus came to die for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right now, that message is being lost in the world. &gt;&gt; Materialism has crept up. &gt;&gt; Modernism has crept up. Amen. The technology has crept up. People have no time for an oldfashioned gospel &gt;&gt; of how we are lost in sin without Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can pull your loved ones out of their condition. &gt;&gt; I'm expecting a testimony out of that right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The words that I speak, they are spirit &gt;&gt; and they are life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You I know some of you asking why are you using that words in the first spirit in the first person. I say again the words that I speak &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they are life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we know there are many we're talking about divine power. Divine power is not of the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think there's a saying I don't know if it's Shakespeare or which spear it is. Somebody spear said to air is human to love is divine. &gt;&gt; You heard that? &gt;&gt; To love is divine. &gt;&gt; I think it was Nelson Mandela. It says no man is born hating another person. &gt;&gt; People are taught to hate. &gt;&gt; Because you're born with love. &gt;&gt; That's a gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we have within us locked up in this power now that we are talking about divine power is the power of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know that sometimes medicine don't work but love can work. &gt;&gt; Amen. Care can work. &gt;&gt; Compassion can work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody's not healing. Go and shower them with love. &gt;&gt; Shower them with good things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you know that you hold within you? I'm talking about divine power now, but I don't I don't have time to detail everything, but I'm going to speak it as it's coming. To forgive is a power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; To forgive one another of their trespasses against you &gt;&gt; is a power that you are releasing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your now when we have this divine character. Now remember the prophet is saying that our character has been molded and he says there was never a people that has been molded like this end time bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Praise the Lord. Now I'm saying that once we develop this character, it becomes the seat from which we rule and reign the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So which means our character becomes our power. &gt;&gt; The character training was not for no reason. &gt;&gt; The reason he molded us into the character of Jesus, maybe you need to put up Galatians chapter 5:22 there. The character of Jesus is because that was going to become the seat of our power &gt;&gt; with this godlike character. We are going to rule situations. We are going to speak to atmospheres. We are going to speak to problems. You can't walk into a room and leave it and walk into a problem and leave that room in the with the same problem or worse problem. &gt;&gt; You become the solution to the problem. You become the one that changes the atmosphere &gt;&gt; because you have developed a character and a wisdom that comes from God. &gt;&gt; You walk into an hostile situation. When you leave that place, peace is prevailing. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is the character, the fruit of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love. We said love is a power. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Joy. Some people don't know what joy is. They only know joy on December 25th. Joy to the world, the Lord has come. Amen. Every other day they're a miserable rich. They love that song Amazing Grace that save the rich like me. &gt;&gt; But I've got joy like a river. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Joy like a river. Yes. &gt;&gt; Joy like a river in my soul. &gt;&gt; Peace. &gt;&gt; Some people can never live peaceibly with all men. &gt;&gt; They grew up with such anger, such hatred. Nobody can tell me one word. &gt;&gt; I am a disturb of peace. Amen. They become a disturber of peace. Longsuffering. Longsuffering. Can you longsuffer with your brother? The disciples said, "Ah, this person's here. How long must I forgive you?" Seven times. Jesus says, "Unfortunately or fortunately, you're in the kingdom of heaven and yet we walk by multiplication." &gt;&gt; So, you got to forgive him 70 * 7. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people have calculated now they say, "Hey, you got one more chance." &gt;&gt; Amen. But have longsuffering. I'm showing you the character development. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gentleness. Gentleness. The nature of a dove. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gentle. Goodness. Goodness. I I say that we need to express more of this goodness. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you can't if you can't say you you can't say, "Lord, I can't see where I can express my goodness." Well, open your eyes. &gt;&gt; Look to the left. Look to the right. &gt;&gt; You can express your goodness to the ones that's a part of your own body. &gt;&gt; Faith. All of this, remember, is a power now. Love is a power. Joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness. This is a power. Amen. &gt;&gt; Goodness, faith. It becomes a seed from which you rule. Faith is a power. Amen. Let's go on. Meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law. Amen. I just want to detail the character development that we have been going through. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I want to read this. It might be a bit lengthy, but I want to try and get through it as soon as possible. Amen. Now, I want you to lay this down here and I want you to see it. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. He says his bride, this is now, Amen. his bride will have to be the same kind of character, &gt;&gt; right? Your character is God's character. That's the kind of character you are because you are the character of your father, &gt;&gt; right? Are we in that? You still looking for it? Amen. Praise the Lord. It was. Amen. Yeah. So, you got it. Praise the Lord. So, your character is your father. Now, listen to what character you have. How many of you ready for it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's get to the next one there. 33. He's talking about God and how he gave his life, right? He says the life watch the life is took for the blood. The life itself is took the life is took for the blood. The blood was applied and the life could not come on the believer for the life of an animal. &gt;&gt; So animal life cannot remit sin forever. &gt;&gt; It was a temporary sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? But now watch what he says. But instead of a human being, Jesus was not a human being is what the prophet is trying to say. &gt;&gt; Watch what he was. He was it was a super &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Super &gt;&gt; human being. &gt;&gt; Jesus was a super &gt;&gt; super human being. &gt;&gt; See, and that makes the human being now not only a human being. So he's saying that life has come upon us. &gt;&gt; If you are super super super &gt;&gt; what does it make you and I that's what the prophet is saying it does. Now we are not only a human being but he's a son and daughter of God of the super super super life that was in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Comes back upon you and changes you from a sinner and things of the world a church member denominational goer to a born again Christian filled with the spirit. The life of God just flowing from you. &gt;&gt; That's the power flowing from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many times you said super? Amen. You are a super super super life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's get to the next one. He says, "And may the Holy Spirit in all of his divine power in his shakana glory come rolling down through the eternities into our heart, Lord, find his dwelling place for these last days." The Holy Spirit was not meant to float around like a ghost. The Holy Spirit was meant to tabernacle bodies. &gt;&gt; So I say even now, Amen. You give eviction orders to every demon power. You give eviction orders to every satanic force of the enemy. Amen. You give eviction orders to every power that has been illegally holding you bound. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's looking for a dwelling place in these last days. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and call us to the service as messengers. Now watch now most of us would think that when the Holy Ghost is coming like he's saying the Holy Ghost filling us how is it going to be manifested? Watch what he says. He says maybe not for the pulpit. Somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But at the filling station &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is going to be oper in operation now in the filling station. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Nathaniel and brother Shman when you are now servicing the pool the Holy Ghost is going to be there &gt;&gt; at the wash tub shall be modernized while you switching the washing machine on &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is there &gt;&gt; but I thought it'll be high level power usage no in your daily life &gt;&gt; at the police station washed up wherever it might be to testify to the milkman Amen. &gt;&gt; To the paper boy &gt;&gt; or whatever it might be. &gt;&gt; Now I know we're not used to accustomed to this kind of teaching &gt;&gt; because we only want high levels of the Holy Ghost outpouring of power at a prayer line maybe. &gt;&gt; But he's saying take it to your daily activities. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The power of the Holy Ghost. What are we talking about? The super super super life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants to manifest you now. The filling station. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the milkman. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Whatever it might be, make us testimonies and living stones filled with the shakina glory. The Holy Spirit himself fill our hearts and lives, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this is what I want you to get to. The true church of Jesus Christ, the bride, is likened to pure gold. How many of you like gold? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you don't like gold. I'll make you smile. I'll show it on your teeth there. Amen. Praise the Lord. You really like gold. Amen. People like to put gold on their tooth because when they smile, they want you to sparkle. Amen. &gt;&gt; They value gold so much that they put it in their mouth. Praise the Lord. They're thinking now if I die maybe that gold will slip into heaven. You know that in heaven the pavement is gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they're going to ask you why you brought the pavement and came. &gt;&gt; The true church of Jesus Christ, the bride, is likened to pure gold, &gt;&gt; not ordinary gold. Now, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Pure gold. Her righteousness is his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody needs to hear this. &gt;&gt; People are thinking they are not righteous, which is nullifying the work of the cross. &gt;&gt; Your righteousness is God's righteousness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Her attributes are his own glorious attributes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Her identity is found in him. &gt;&gt; What he is, she is to reflect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What he has, she is to manifest. &gt;&gt; There is no fault in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to go home and Google this and not Google it. Go look in your message church message search where the prophet says, "Shut your mouth. Because if I say it now, you're going to think I'm being rude. Jen, &gt;&gt; you need to tell every voice that is telling you that you're unrighteous. &gt;&gt; Every voice that is telling you there's fault in you. &gt;&gt; Every voice that's telling you, Amen. speaking against you, you need to tell it, "Shut your mouth." &gt;&gt; Silence every voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There is no fault in her. She's all glorious within and without &gt;&gt; from beginning to ending. She is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect. In fact, in her summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of God. How can one fathom it? How can one understand it? Though we cannot do that, we accept it by faith for God had spoken it. &gt;&gt; But not only is the candlestick of gold, it is beaten gold and crafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints. You see, your blueprint meant that you needed to be beaten. I don't know if you know what a blueprint is. If you got a blueprint for this building a church here, you'll see it's got to be built according to this design and spec dimensions. Right? So, he's saying the blueprint for our lives was to be molded and shaped. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; According to her blueprints which were spirit given outside of her Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of Jesus Christ. Surely she's filling up the sufferings that Christ has left behind. Her goods are deso despoise. Her life is in jeopardy. She's accounted as sheep for the slaughter. She's killed all of the day long. She suffers much. But in all is ret in all it retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer. Worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; and as gold is malible whereas brass will break with a beating. This gold of God will bear a suffering for the Lord. Not bowed, not broken, not destroyed, but formed as a thing of beauty and a joy forever by the trials and testings of this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, where where does this leave us? We are here right now. Amen. If you go and read Genesis 1 verse 20 from to where God is telling Adam to multiply and replenish the earth, there is one species that was not reproduced &gt;&gt; from the original creation. One species was not reproduced &gt;&gt; and that's the God man species. &gt;&gt; Adam's life was not reproduced the way it was supposed to be reproduced. &gt;&gt; So which means the God man was not reproduced on the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Malachi 4:5 and 6 come to turn our hearts back to our origins. &gt;&gt; Amen. come to reveal to us our pedigree and our gene seed to tell us we are going back to our riches and Jesus Christ is now going to have a bride and reproduce the God man again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to Matthew 28 verse 18. Hallelujah. Jesus is saying and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given. Now, how many of you know what the word all means? &gt;&gt; All power is given unto me. &gt;&gt; You mean all power in heaven? Yes. &gt;&gt; All power on the earth. Yes. &gt;&gt; Is where? In Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying is given to me. Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, because all power is given unto me, we all just quote Matthew 28:19, but it's following verse 18. He says, "Now, because all power in heaven is given unto me, all power in earth is given unto me, I'm releasing this power to you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now he goes to 28:19. Go with this power &gt;&gt; and teach all nations &gt;&gt; baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. There is no such thing as a trinity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice what he's saying. The name of the father &gt;&gt; and of the son and of the holy ghost. When you get baptized, the pastor or the priest shouldn't come there and say whatever they say in the name of the father, in the name of the son, in the name of the holy ghost. If I you are sensible people, he's saying in the name. So what is the name? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible is saying baptize in the name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that the prophet came to reveal to us the name is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If you were baptized in the father, son, and holy ghost, you are not baptized in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were baptized in titles. &gt;&gt; Is father a title? If I ask you what's your father's name, you can't tell me your father's name is father &gt;&gt; unless he's really name father in the book &gt;&gt; his name the name of the son you can't tell me if I ask you what's the name of your son even though at home you call him son that's not his name &gt;&gt; he's got a name &gt;&gt; and the name of the Holy Ghost Yeah. Jesus said, "I came in my father's name." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I'll send another one in my name." So the father, son, and holy ghost all have the same name. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I know when you get to heaven, some of you going to play hiding game. You're going to come ready or not? Here I come. You can look for the father. &gt;&gt; You can look for the son. &gt;&gt; You look for holy ghost separately. &gt;&gt; Amen. The entire fullness of the godhead and you'll see it in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he's releasing a power and I'm saying this power is not given to you by man. Holy Ghost power is not given to you by man. This divine power we are talking about is not given to you by man. It's not given by governments. It's not given amen to operate in the earthly kingdom. But this is far more superior. The highest power that is in heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, we need a power to wrestle against demon powers. &gt;&gt; It says in Ephesians 6:12, we wrestle not against flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; Yes. but against principalities, powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. So what we need is spiritual power is needed to confront these spiritual realms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you are reading that? We are not fighting fleshly battles here. We are fighting spiritual battles. &gt;&gt; They sometimes manifest in the flesh. You'll find this brother picking on you. You'll find this brother saying things that is not the brother. That is a demon power that has possessed that person to come against you. And as long as you fight in the flesh and blood, you are not going to win the battle. You need to go into spiritual realms and start to bind that spirit. Amen. Whatsoever you bind on earth is bound in heaven. Whatsoever you loose on earth is loosed in heaven. We've got to realize the power that's laying within us. &gt;&gt; But all we want to do is roll up our sleeves and act. We've got to go spiritual when people are going carnal. When people are going fleshly, we've got to go spiritually. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. realms unseen to the human eye but realms that exist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are realms that are unseen to the human eye. Sometimes you see a person demon possessed, you can't see that realm but yet you can see that demon manifesting in them. That realm exists. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you read there in in Revelation chapter Amen chapter what's it six he says hell followed this rider on the horse. So, which means hell is let loose upon the earth right now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. This is the time, Amen, where people are lusting for power. Look at what's happening there in the in the Middle East. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They want atomic power. Israel and America says, "No, we don't want them to have atomic power." I wonder why we in this season now there's a fight for power, atomic power. While we are talking about divine power, I want to let you know that divine power is more powerful than atomic power. &gt;&gt; What you seen happen in in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, that atomic bomb, you seen devastation in May. How many of you have seen that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They say they're still living off some of the effects of that atomic power. &gt;&gt; Amen. And right now, they have so advanced in nuclear abilities. But I tell you, the power that you possess, &gt;&gt; Amen. You can even stop an atomic bomb. &gt;&gt; Hey, come on. &gt;&gt; How can you have super super super super life &gt;&gt; and a bomb be more powerful than you? &gt;&gt; You are more powerful than the atomic bomb. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we find every nation is lusting now. Amen. trying to show themselves superior with superior power. Some are flexing with military power. Amen. Some are flexing with economic power. Look at China, the economic power. Look at India, the economic power. &gt;&gt; America knows they are no match for these two powers. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; America is unsure of the military power of Russia. Unsure of the military power of Iran. Amen. And and and people are flexing the religious power. All kinds of power. Amen. People are flexing the political power. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and nation, Amen. flexing also demonic power. &gt;&gt; Passing all kinds of laws in the land. Gay marriages, homosexuals. &gt;&gt; These are not normal things. &gt;&gt; A male and a male can't produce a baby. &gt;&gt; A female and a female can't reproduce a baby. It's only a male and a female. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we find in the midst of all the flexing of power, military, political, religious, demonic power, economic power, a people have been transformed by the renewing of their minds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A people who are a new creation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A people for which all creation has been groaning for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the earth has been groaning, waiting for you. &gt;&gt; Yes. for this time and season because you carry within you a power. &gt;&gt; But God has been developing our character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this power is about to be unleashed upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The God man species is being reproduced on the earth right now. &gt;&gt; Even through the preaching of the word, God is taking out. Amen. All doubt. God is taking all fear and the fate is being swn into the hearts of the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. People want to see all kinds of manifestations. People want bubble gum prophecies. &gt;&gt; Somebody out there. Somebody out there. Somebody out there. &gt;&gt; I want you to know we've had a prophet that didn't use the word somebody. &gt;&gt; Now we're slipping into denominational styles. &gt;&gt; And people in the audience so gullible is screaming amen. I thought we supposed to be word solid &gt;&gt; when a prophecy is coming forth. You stay in what road? Your name is Joshua? Direct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Precise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Telling them what's wrong with them. Yes. &gt;&gt; Telling them ex exactly which doctor you you went to see a certain doctor &gt;&gt; or I see another tall man praying for you. &gt;&gt; You were you were standing there in the prayer line of Oral Roberts. People are impersonating &gt;&gt; the impersonation &gt;&gt; of giftings. &gt;&gt; Jesus said don't judge them &gt;&gt; by their judge them by their fruits. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's bring this to a close now. The divine character of God, the divine power of God, the divine glory of God. Amen. This is the man that God has created in his image and likeness. Amen. And these people are being reproduced on the earth now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, some of you are sitting here with a problem. You're sitting here with a situation and you're thinking, "How is this going to help me?" I'm telling you if you can rise up to your true potential as a son of God &gt;&gt; there's nothing can stand before you &gt;&gt; nothing will be impossible to you &gt;&gt; say bro I need five rand why are you telling me about being a son of god the son of god if you stand up in your true potential five rand will be nothing &gt;&gt; you'll get 100 rand &gt;&gt; you'll be able to operate in your potential &gt;&gt; hey when called I don't know maybe you need to reread your bible Yes. &gt;&gt; When God calls Abraham, he says, "I'm going to bless you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your seed after you will be blessed. &gt;&gt; Some of you saying, "My seed after me, I don't know what's going to happen to them." &gt;&gt; But the Bible is saying your seed after you is going to be blessed. &gt;&gt; It says a wise man leaves an inheritance for his children's children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what? It's not too late. Yes. &gt;&gt; It don't matter your age. Right now, you can turn your situation around. &gt;&gt; How? Get into and tap into the divine power of God. &gt;&gt; Hear what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Re look at your life and see maybe situations he was building your character and you refuse character training. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Romans 8:37 says, "In all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I persuade us neither death, the power of death can't touch me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. No life, no angels, principalities, no powers, things present, or things to come, height, depth, no other creature shall be able to separate me from the power of the love of God. &gt;&gt; Which is Christ Jesus our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Divine revelation is a power. Now listen to this. Divine revelation is a power released to you. &gt;&gt; You have a revelation of this message. That's a power released to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen again. Divine revelation is a power that's released to you. You are thinking you're just an ordinary person. But I believe this message and I believe such a powerful prophet that's a divine power released to you. &gt;&gt; Revelation is a power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we don't realize it &gt;&gt; that we can speak a word to somebody and it can break shackles off of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can break Amen. strongholds. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

What she stands for. She can do the greater works. She will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; If they get a true revelation of the true spirits in the framework of the Christian church, he's able to discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit. Satan will be powerless before her. Let me tell you something. The gates of hell cannot prevail against you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Satan hates revelation, but we love it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With true revelation in our lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail against us, but we will prevail over them. He takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we fail to get it. Amen. Didn't Jesus say, "Amen." When he was asking Peter, &gt;&gt; who do men say that I am? &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou art the Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; What did Jesus tell him? &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood can't give you this kind of revelation. &gt;&gt; He says, "But my father in heaven, he has revealed it to you." &gt;&gt; So in other words, he was telling him a power was released to you, Peter. &gt;&gt; The power of revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says with this power of revelation, Satan and his army, these 200 million demons that are let loose upon the earth, they cannot prevail against your power. They cannot prevail against your revelation. You can say, Satan, it is written. &gt;&gt; It is written over my family. It is written over my life. I break generational curses even now. Amen. Things that my father carried, things that my grandfather carried. I break that curse and that cycle in my life. You're going through situations. You're going through problems. You can't understand why you're in a holding pattern because the word of God declares unto the fourth generation will I bring this curse upon you. But you have the power of the blood. You have the power of the Holy Ghost to break every generational curse even now. [Applause] &gt;&gt; How many of you know what your grandfather did? You don't know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that thing is plaguing you. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do you think the first thing the doctor asked you was there a history of this in your family? &gt;&gt; They are trying to connect you with generational diseases with generational curses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're like a humble lamb say yes. My father was a diabetic. You know what you're doing? Opening up doors &gt;&gt; for spirits to come through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you realize who you are in this time and season, &gt;&gt; you don't have to lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because your father &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; is not your earthly father. My father is God. So you tell the doctor, "My father has never had cancer. My father has never had heart disease. My father has never had sugar diabetes. My father has never had high blood pressure." &gt;&gt; My father is God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right there.

He says, watch, I'm talking about now they're trying to bring about powers to unite. Amen. We're talking about divine power, right? But I'm paralleling now with these earthly powers, demonic powers. He says the council was held. They elected the headbishop. By doing this, they united church and stayed together. What is it? Two powers coming together. &gt;&gt; Then he dropped his bow. He got off his white horse. He got off his red horse. For he can kill anybody that don't agree with him. &gt;&gt; There is your seal. Same fellow. Watch him ride on into eternity yonder with it. See unites both his powers together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you say, &gt;&gt; "What has it got to do with anything?" Don't you know he's an impersonator? &gt;&gt; Don't you know Satan is a copycat? &gt;&gt; If he is uniting powers together, &gt;&gt; what do you think the church of the living God has been doing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's been four powers, amen, around the throne. &gt;&gt; The power of the lion, &gt;&gt; the power of the hawks, &gt;&gt; the power of the man, and the power of the flying eagle. &gt;&gt; Amen. As Satan was hopping horses, these powers were uniting and moving on from the lion to the ox, from the ox to the man, and from the man right now into the age of that flying eagle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uniting the power of the revealed word for the power of the spoken word. I come on somebody hear what I just said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All of us are rejoicing under the power of the revealed word. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to take it and translate it from the revealed word to the spoken word &gt;&gt; because the spoken word is the original seed. We all can rejoice with the revealed word. But we need to translate the revealed word to the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is uniting both the mechanics and the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The power of the mechanics and the power of the dynamics to create an unstoppable power in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For too long, we've had just the mechanics. The mechanics, the mechanics, but God wants to unite the mechanics with the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Re your revelation is the power that makes you invincible.

You can't inherit revelation. &gt;&gt; Your father can't give you revelation. &gt;&gt; Your mother can't give you revelation. You can't give it to your children. Amen. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood can't give you revelation, Jesus said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And neither can you manufacture revelation. &gt;&gt; You can't manufacture revelation to defeat the enemy. You yourself have got to have a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And also, it's not a group revelation. &gt;&gt; It's an individual revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

What's the slingshot? &gt;&gt; Amen. David picked up the stone. He picked up the word. A lot of us are picking up the word. &gt;&gt; But we don't know what to do with the stone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The enemy is watching you pick up the stone. &gt;&gt; You picked up the stone. You got the word. You got the word. You got the word. But you don't know what to do with the word. &gt;&gt; But the prophet says the bride has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; So what did he do? David picks up the stone. We are picking up the word. Amen. And we are putting it in the mouth of our slingshot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The slingshot is our mouth. &gt;&gt; The mouth of faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You go to a sick baby.
