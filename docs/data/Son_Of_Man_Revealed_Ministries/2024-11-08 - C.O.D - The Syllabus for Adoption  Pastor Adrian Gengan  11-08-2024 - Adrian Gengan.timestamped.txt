[4:41] hallelujah I greet you all in the
[4:42] precious
[4:44] name the matchless name yes amen the
[4:47] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[4:50] amen it's the name above every other
[4:52] name amen hallelujah maybe we think
[4:55] something about the Gen name or the Mami
[4:58] name or the p name or
[5:00] something but there's no name that can
[5:03] compare with that name yes Lord and
[5:05] Jesus said you take that name with you
[5:08] and you cast out demons in that name
[5:10] amen you speak in my name you ask in my
[5:12] name amen hallelujah so we are just
[5:15] thankful that we can obey the word of
[5:17] God and we understand the Revelation
[5:19] behind that amen it is just not Hing
[5:23] that name but there's got to be a life
[5:25] behind that name that makes the demons
[5:27] tremble amen hallelujah amen amen so
[5:31] once again we greet you all in the
[5:32] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[5:33] Jesus Christ suddenly a privilege to be
[5:35] gathered together in the house of the
[5:37] Lord amen I have a confession to make
[5:39] that I love the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[5:42] and I love his people amen hallelujah
[5:45] how many of you feel that way amen just
[5:47] become so drunk in the spirit you know
[5:49] they even try to boil but you can't boil
[5:51] the bride in oil because she thrives by
[5:53] oil amen they tried to boil John in oil
[5:57] but oil didn't work amen amen so this
[6:00] bride is just like John and when he went
[6:02] back in and he wrote those three last
[6:04] Epistles you can see he was the Apostle
[6:06] of love amen John being the type of the
[6:09] Bride that received all the Revelation
[6:11] became the Apostle of love the bride
[6:14] that's growing up now in seven in the
[6:16] Statue of a perfect man the Capstone of
[6:18] love coming down she becomes the bride
[6:20] the wife of love amen hallelujah a cap
[6:23] is love she can't help but express love
[6:25] amen hallelujah when the dead in Christ
[6:28] rise they shall the void themselves
[6:31] that's our hope that's our faith nobody
[6:34] can feel the void of Pastor Ronnie going
[6:36] away but who F that
[6:38] void when the scripture comes to pass
[6:42] because he hasn't gone away we're not
[6:44] done away with him he's just in another
[6:46] place but he will come and take his
[6:48] place and I was sharing with them that
[6:50] not one of them that die in Christ shall
[6:53] miss the Rapture because the Bible says
[6:55] the dead in Christ shall First Rise then
[6:57] we which shall alive and remain our body
[6:59] shall be changed and we shall be changed
[7:01] in the moment in the twinkling of an
[7:03] eye so the saints that are going on
[7:06] shall not miss the Rapture in fact all
[7:08] seven Church ages shall not miss the
[7:10] Rapture they are going to be there but
[7:12] that's the value of the message that we
[7:14] know these things amen hallelujah so
[7:17] this morning amen we want to turn to the
[7:18] word of God if we can stand for the word
[7:20] of God Amen also continue to pray for
[7:23] brother Moses amen our dear brother amen
[7:27] the Lord will touch him he's in a
[7:28] hospital admitted in hospital at the
[7:30] moment but we pray amen that God maybe
[7:32] can even use a sence to diagnose a case
[7:34] and tell us what's wrong so we know what
[7:36] areas to Target amen hallelujah because
[7:39] I'm not one who doesn't believe the
[7:41] Prophet The Prophet says God works
[7:43] through medicine God heals through
[7:44] medicine God heals through music God
[7:47] heals through his word amen amen God
[7:50] heals through his preaching so there's
[7:52] many ways that God heals and however his
[7:54] Sovereign hand chooses to work amen we
[7:57] are willing to obey that so this morning
[8:00] I want to speak on the syllabus for
[8:02] adoption and
[8:03] Redemption am amen the syllabus for
[8:07] adoption and Redemption and if you're
[8:10] asking what is that
[8:12] syllabus Galatians 4 says we are placed
[8:15] under tutors yes so a tutor must have a
[8:18] syllabus oh yes Hallelujah you know we
[8:21] jumped ahead of the story and we said
[8:23] the sun will go under tutorship but
[8:25] tonight today we want to focus on what
[8:27] the syllabus is yesen
[8:30] amen praise the Lord so the syllabus for
[8:32] adoption and Redemption is c o
[8:37] d
[8:38] hallelujah hallelujah so things may get
[8:41] hot and heavy but we in battle yes
[8:44] Hallelujah let's turn to 1 Timothy CH 3
[8:47] and ver1 15 praise the Lord remember we
[8:50] wrestle not against flesh and blood yes
[8:52] but against principalities and Powers
[8:55] rulers of Darkness spiritual wickedness
[8:57] in our places so 1 Timothy 3 15 but if I
[9:00] T long thou mayest know how thou
[9:04] oughtest to behave thyself in the house
[9:07] of God Amen which is the Church of the
[9:10] Living God the pillar and ground of the
[9:16] truth where is who is the pillar of and
[9:19] ground of Truth the Church of the Living
[9:22] God so truth must be coming out of us
[9:25] yes amen so he's saying we ought to know
[9:27] how to behave ourselves in the house of
[9:30] God for 2 Timothy 3 and: 16 you can open
[9:33] your bibl amen hallelujah open your
[9:37] Bibles is like music sheets amen and if
[9:41] you don't know that's one of the uh
[9:43] parts of conduct order and Doctrine is
[9:45] for you to carry your Bible to church
[9:47] and when the word of God is read you
[9:49] read it from your Bible amen so 2
[9:51] Timothy 3 and: 16 says all scripture is
[9:55] given by inspiration of God and is
[9:58] profitable for do
[10:00] so we we we read the first one is
[10:02] behavior which was your conduct second
[10:04] now it's profitable for Doctrine for
[10:06] reproof for correction for instruction
[10:09] in righteousness that the man of God may
[10:12] be perfect amen thly furnished unto all
[10:16] good works am so the word of God is
[10:18] going to thoroughly furnish you maybe in
[10:22] your house you don't have the money to
[10:23] furnish your house but the spiritual
[10:25] House of God God is going to thoroughly
[10:28] furnish your house
[10:30] thank you Lord you are not going to have
[10:31] a lounge with no furniture amen you know
[10:34] you are three part your body spirit and
[10:36] soul God is going to fill all of
[10:39] that so 1 Timothy 5:1 17 read let the
[10:44] elders that rule well be counted worthy
[10:46] of double honor especially they will
[10:48] labor in word and Doctrine amen one more
[10:53] scripture St John 1 and verse 12 praise
[10:56] the Lord amen
[10:59] but as many as received him have we
[11:02] received
[11:03] him to them gave you power to become the
[11:07] sons of God even to them that believe on
[11:11] his name amen so he has given us power
[11:15] to become the sons of God you may be
[11:17] seated the Lord at blessings to the
[11:18] reading of his
[11:20] word
[11:21] amen so while you seated I want to read
[11:25] Ephesians chapter
[11:26] 4 amen so we are all striving for
[11:31] Perfection yes amen amen we are all
[11:34] striving to reach that final
[11:38] Perfection where we shall take a
[11:40] changing of the body but we are growing
[11:42] up Amen in the things of Christ amen
[11:45] hallelujah
[11:47] amen and he gave here is God's now God's
[11:51] way of perfecting the church so if I can
[11:54] say it another way the church will not
[11:56] come to Perfection unless this scripture
[11:58] IS F fulfilled now watch it's a very
[12:01] important part of the word because we
[12:03] are talking about conduct order and
[12:06] Doctrine and in God's order he won't
[12:09] work disorderly amen he'll work via his
[12:12] own order so this is the order he gave
[12:15] for the church to be edified now he gave
[12:17] some Apostles some prophets some
[12:20] evangelists and some pastors and
[12:23] teachers now why would he give that
[12:25] here's the answer for the perfecting of
[12:28] the Saints amen
[12:31] amen so you can't say that you can do
[12:35] away with a fivefold Ministry and reach
[12:38] Perfection God won't violate his own
[12:40] word yes amen hallelujah for the work of
[12:43] the ministry amen they must be involved
[12:46] in Ministry you know the prophet defined
[12:49] each office gift there yes amen you can
[12:52] go and read it each offers gift their
[12:54] role what they're supposed to do he
[12:56] defined it for the edifying of the Body
[12:59] of Christ now this is where I feel
[13:02] greater effort needs to be put in in the
[13:04] next verse till we all come in the unity
[13:07] of the faith amen not divide the body of
[13:10] Christ not bring a Doctrine in that will
[13:13] divide the body of Christ amen I'm a
[13:15] firm believer and I don't believe in the
[13:18] analogy of this one thing that we are
[13:20] looking at an elephant and somebody's
[13:22] looking at the leg and somebody's
[13:24] looking at the tail and but we all are
[13:26] looking at the same thing but yet with
[13:29] the same mouth we are saying we have the
[13:31] opening of the word the full word
[13:34] reveal so we had one Prophet one Prophet
[13:38] messenger how come we have different
[13:40] interpretations of that one
[13:42] message yeah now how many of you will
[13:45] agree with me that the full word was
[13:47] revealed to us in this hour amen so God
[13:49] doesn't want you to look at an elephant
[13:51] leg or look at the elephant tail or look
[13:54] at the elephant here he wants you to be
[13:57] in an eagle anointing
[13:59] where you have a full view of the word
[14:02] you must see the full elephant for those
[14:04] of you like the elephant
[14:08] analogy and the pyramid when you look at
[14:11] it from the top you can see all sides of
[14:13] the pyramid yes hallelujah amen so I'm
[14:16] not of that theory brother you know okay
[14:18] you see that way and I see it this way I
[14:20] want to see it God's way I want to see
[14:22] it through the eyes of the Prophet one
[14:25] of us is lying yes Hallelujah
[14:29] of us is dis sorting
[14:31] truth amen now come on we got to call a
[14:34] spade a spade we are in the kingdom of
[14:36] God and we are fighting demon
[14:38] Spirits amen hallelujah amen so we can't
[14:43] be having one message and different
[14:45] interpretations of that message right so
[14:47] now we must come in unity of the faith
[14:49] so any ministry that's dividing is not
[14:51] working with the five-fold ministry and
[14:54] the knowledge of the Son of God and
[14:56] watch going to bring us unto a perfect
[14:59] man amen unto the measure of the stature
[15:03] of the fullness of Christ that we end
[15:05] forth be no more children tossed to and
[15:08] fro carried about with every wind of
[15:10] Doctrine by the Slate of men and canning
[15:13] craftiness whereby they lay in weight to
[15:16] deceive
[15:18] wow amen but speaking the truth in love
[15:23] may grow up oh I love to grow up amen
[15:26] hallelujah May grow up into to him in
[15:29] all things which is the head even Christ
[15:33] amen hallelujah praise the
[15:37] Lord so in Galatians chapter 4 like we
[15:40] were saying you're placed under a tutor
[15:44] now the prophet of God teaches us that
[15:46] you don't become a son when you are born
[15:49] again you always were a son and only a
[15:52] son with the seed Gene with him can be
[15:55] reborn Hallelujah so not everyone can
[15:59] come to this message of the hour this
[16:01] message is for sons of God Amen those
[16:04] that were locked up in the back part of
[16:06] God's mind from before the foundation of
[16:08] the world those who placed a seed Gene
[16:10] within your soul all of you are gathered
[16:13] here today because God called you to the
[16:14] message of the hour there's a seed Gene
[16:17] within you and God has predestinated
[16:19] that se Gene amen so if you are sitting
[16:22] here today don't be discouraged you can
[16:24] only respond to the word and the word is
[16:26] not Grievous to you because there's a SE
[16:29] within your
[16:31] soul now Satan will come and play mind
[16:34] battles but you've got to take the word
[16:35] to the mind to the Battleground amen
[16:38] you've got to defeat Satan by the word
[16:40] and say Satan it is written he gave me
[16:42] power to become a Son of God
[16:44] hallelujah amen so all through our
[16:47] natural life you know that we were
[16:49] following somebody we were led by
[16:51] somebody somebody led us through our
[16:53] childhood somebody led us through our
[16:55] teenage years through our adult life
[16:58] amen these were stages in our growth and
[17:01] your teacher your parents that you were
[17:03] under amen taught you according to the
[17:06] your growth they didn't teach you
[17:08] algebra when you were a little baby but
[17:11] according to the stages of your growth
[17:13] they taught you
[17:15] things amen and as you were growing the
[17:18] teaching increased the instruction got
[17:21] greater and your understanding grew amen
[17:24] now the teacher won't give you more than
[17:27] you can grasp in natural and in the
[17:30] spiritual amen I want you to know that
[17:34] father knows you by name yes Father
[17:37] Knows you individually amen father knows
[17:40] which area of development you need in
[17:42] your
[17:43] life hallelujah
[17:46] amen and if the teacher can see you
[17:49] cannot grasp certain Concepts he slows
[17:52] down the teaching until you
[17:54] understand now what we were saying is I
[17:58] want you to understand something and
[18:00] this blessed my heart when I when I was
[18:02] was reading it when Jesus was baptized
[18:05] at the Jordan River we know that was the
[18:09] Holy Spirit coming into him now we know
[18:12] there's two works the Holy Spirit does
[18:14] two Works he's coming for a birth and
[18:17] for an adoption amen so Matthew chapter
[18:20] 3 he's there at the Jordan River and the
[18:23] Holy Spirit descends like a dove yes
[18:26] okay so catch this now there's a
[18:28] specific work now that he's going to do
[18:30] in his three and a half years of
[18:32] ministry yes okay he's the God man yes
[18:36] he's basically Adam reproduced yes but
[18:39] he's not born of a woman he comes to
[18:41] show us the kind of man Adam was what we
[18:44] fell from yes amen so listen to this now
[18:47] Jesus goes in Matthew chapter 17 up on a
[18:52] mountain for what brother brandham calls
[18:54] his adoption
[18:56] ceremony hallelujah amen amen now watch
[18:59] the timing of it is what I'm trying to
[19:01] tell you because as was he so is
[19:04] she the process that he goes through she
[19:07] will go through but I ask you was it
[19:10] before his body
[19:15] change
[19:16] Hallelujah it was before Jesus died
[19:20] buried and rose again that he was taken
[19:23] on a great adoption ceremony and he'll
[19:25] set you before Angels come on don't look
[19:27] for things in the future God is doing
[19:30] now God is going to do it
[19:34] now
[19:35] amen his adoption ceremony was before he
[19:41] entered
[19:43] Hallelujah so you and I are coming now
[19:46] in our great adoption
[19:48] ceremony
[19:50] Hallelujah specific time and season now
[19:53] remember the church has progressed we've
[19:55] had the prophetic word hallelujah we
[19:58] we've had the prophetic anointing we've
[20:00] had the prophetic gift come to take the
[20:02] word and open it up unto us but there's
[20:05] been a progression we've been under the
[20:06] tutor we've been under the guide amen
[20:09] hallelujah all of these things we've
[20:11] been hearing through the years amen have
[20:13] been building Upon Our Most Holy Faith
[20:15] Hallelujah now now is not the time to
[20:17] have a crisis of Faith now is not the
[20:19] time to backslide now is not the time to
[20:22] go and do the things of the world
[20:23] because you're thinking since Brandon
[20:25] fell asleep all things continue as they
[20:29] amen nothing is
[20:31] progressing don't let Satan deceive you
[20:34] in this hour and you know what you lay
[20:36] with a dog will get its
[20:38] fleas watch the company you keeping
[20:43] Hallelujah either they are going to
[20:45] influence you or you are going to
[20:47] influence them amen
[20:50] hallelujah
[20:52] amen now anybody that rejects the
[20:55] message of the
[20:57] hour that's equal to blasphemy because
[21:00] his message is the Holy
[21:02] Ghost
[21:04] yes
[21:06] Hallelujah this message is the message
[21:09] of
[21:12] redemption even the Bible says when
[21:14] you're going into a place and they don't
[21:16] receive your word that's your feet
[21:19] Hallelujah he says judgment is coming
[21:21] upon that
[21:23] town so I'm telling you what the company
[21:26] you keep watch the people you love and
[21:30] don't go and marry an unbeliever because
[21:33] you want Satan to be your
[21:38] father-in-law she is going to make her
[21:42] life like what she's used to
[21:47] H so you young men That's not married
[21:50] yet don't ever the prophet says don't
[21:52] ever marry an
[21:55] unbeliever hello
[21:58] all you see married people here you all
[22:00] talk to one another don't ever look
[22:02] don't ever marry an
[22:06] unbeliever hallelujah
[22:08] amen and from our experiences these ones
[22:12] that grow up in denominations are even
[22:14] worse because they are
[22:17] religious and they will tell you they'll
[22:19] give you to understand they are
[22:20] Christians now you're going to go there
[22:22] and tell them ah but why are you wearing
[22:25] pants they've been wearing pants since
[22:27] they were born yeah unless they a c Gene
[22:30] of
[22:32] God that God delivers them from there
[22:35] and brings them out of there amen but
[22:37] you don't go and test it don't go say
[22:40] I'm bringing them in they're going to
[22:42] take you out the deadly snipers here
[22:45] they'll take you out amen praise the
[22:49] [Music]
[22:52] Lord so what's The Company You
[22:56] Keep amen
[23:00] so God is going to put us through trials
[23:02] and testing right not
[23:05] Temptations the trial and the test is to
[23:07] prove you that you're a Son of God
[23:10] you're a daughter of God Amen anyone
[23:13] that is studying goes through a testing
[23:16] time you study for 3 years you go and
[23:19] you put through a test that test is not
[23:22] the university wanting to fail you they
[23:25] want to see if you have become what you
[23:26] have learned
[23:28] yes
[23:30] amen that you being a Son of God can
[23:32] handle the test with patience with
[23:34] Temperance you can handle it with faith
[23:36] you can handle it with knowledge and you
[23:38] you know it's intended design is for you
[23:40] to pass and move on to the next
[23:42] dimension of the Holy
[23:44] Ghost so you have to be put through a
[23:47] test and exam to prove to the tutor that
[23:49] you understood the teaching so he says
[23:52] count it all
[23:54] joy when fiery Trials come upon you amen
[23:58] amen amen when you put through a test
[23:59] count it all
[24:01] joy because the one amen that put you
[24:05] put you through the test he says he's
[24:06] more than able to deliver you amen amen
[24:09] that's the word of God so they want to
[24:12] see if the knowledge locked up inside of
[24:14] you when you write the exams and pass
[24:16] amen is to prove that you are now become
[24:18] what you have studied the books and
[24:21] knowledge contained in the book is now
[24:22] on two feet so we can't have people
[24:25] sitting for 20 years studying the
[24:27] syllabus
[24:30] and failing the
[24:33] syllabus you see the Dynamics have to
[24:36] come upon something amen the Dynamics
[24:40] don't come upon
[24:41] nothing the Dy the the Dynamics come
[24:44] upon the mechanics which is the word of
[24:46] God that is sown in our hearts can
[24:48] somebody say Amen the Holy Ghost is not
[24:51] coming there on empty where there's no
[24:53] word the Holy Ghost feeds on the word
[24:56] the prophet says he feeds on the word
[24:58] Hallelujah now when the Holy Ghost you
[25:00] can't come into the service raise your
[25:02] hand and say welcome Holy Spirit welcome
[25:05] welcome Holy Spirit he's coming to feed
[25:08] and now he comes to your house and he
[25:10] sees your cupboard empty there's no
[25:12] word amen amen born again on a Sunday
[25:16] gone again on a Monday born again on a
[25:19] Wednesday gone again on a Thursday
[25:23] Hallelujah now remember it's very
[25:26] important to follow the instruction from
[25:30] the spirit of Truth amen because Saul
[25:33] lost the kingdom he lost his anointing
[25:36] because of Disobedience and the
[25:38] scripture says it is better to obey
[25:41] obedience is better than
[25:44] sacrifice so you don't want to lose your
[25:47] blessing in the Kingdom because you are
[25:49] affected by the veil that it is coming
[25:51] out
[25:52] of the prophet of God said if you can't
[25:55] if you don't even if you don't love your
[25:57] pastor he said you respect his office
[26:00] yes you respect that
[26:03] office amen because that is God's Veil
[26:07] praise the Lord so in the kingdom of God
[26:10] we've been placed under a tutor a guide
[26:12] the spirit of Truth and he has a
[26:14] syllabus which is the word of God amen
[26:17] amen now God has only one way to reveal
[26:19] the syllabus and the Hidden
[26:22] Mysteries and that is through his
[26:24] Prophet surely the Lord God will do
[26:26] nothing but he Reveals His sec secret to
[26:28] his servant the prophets am
[26:31] amen and he interprets the word we know
[26:34] how he interprets the word by letting it
[26:35] come to pass amen hallelujah so when a
[26:39] son is born into a home now we are not
[26:41] used to
[26:42] this we are not used to this Eastern
[26:45] tradition that when a son is born into a
[26:47] home he's placed under
[26:51] tutors right but in the Eastern
[26:54] tradition that the Bible is talking
[26:55] about here he is placed under tutors
[26:59] the father's business must continue and
[27:02] he the prophet of God dramatizes it and
[27:03] he says he don't have time to teach the
[27:06] son he's got to attend to his business
[27:09] so while the son is growing up he's
[27:11] putting you under tutors amen
[27:15] okay so we have been placed now in not
[27:19] in a home but in a kingdom when we are
[27:22] born again we are born into the kingdom
[27:25] and we are placed under tutorship of the
[27:27] Holy Spirit
[27:28] some of you say you're speaking very
[27:30] simple very plain I like to speak simple
[27:32] and plain that a child can understand me
[27:35] amen when you are put into the kingdom
[27:37] of God you placed under the tutorship of
[27:40] the holy spirit amen so we have we are
[27:44] now on a spiritual journey a growth now
[27:47] like we saying we cannot be backsliding
[27:49] now with the things of the world in the
[27:51] time of the Rapture the cycle of the
[27:53] Rapture has already begun which is the
[27:55] shout which started amen
[27:58] now the voice of the Archangel amen is
[28:01] fixing to change to the voice of the
[28:03] resurrection and call the sleeping
[28:04] Saints
[28:07] amen yes
[28:09] amen now we know that the Bible truths
[28:11] were lost through seven Church
[28:14] ages the full word the full strength of
[28:18] the word through deception amen the
[28:20] writer went out
[28:22] riding and the truth were taken out from
[28:24] the people and they began to take Creeds
[28:27] and dogmas and man's ideas about the
[28:30] word and what the word says just to give
[28:33] you an example the true baptism of
[28:35] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:37] Christ was taken away and replaced with
[28:39] the titles Father Son and Holy Ghost but
[28:42] in the Bible you'll find that all the
[28:44] disciples baptized in the name of the
[28:46] Lord Jesus Christ can you say amen
[28:48] amen now what is that
[28:52] Doctrine amen praise the
[28:56] Lord so we find the church went into
[28:58] apostasy which means that they abandoned
[29:01] the word of God for Creeds dogmas and
[29:03] men's ideas but Jesus said that man must
[29:07] live by bread and by the word of
[29:11] God some of you are shocked Jesus said
[29:13] don't live by bread alone which means
[29:16] you can live by
[29:17] bread man must live by bread and the
[29:20] word of
[29:22] God every word that proceeds from the
[29:25] mouth of God praise the Lord
[29:30] so it is through the tutor that the sun
[29:32] will be
[29:34] positioned when the training is coming
[29:37] to an end it is through the tutor the
[29:40] report that the tutor is going to give
[29:42] that the son will be positioned
[29:44] amen depending on how well he is
[29:47] following the tutor's instruction
[29:49] learning and how well he is
[29:52] growing now the basis of the syllabus we
[29:55] know we have ABCs we start our syllabus
[29:58] with ABCs always believe Christ
[30:02] amen amen any man who come to God must
[30:05] first believe that he is a reward of
[30:07] them that diligently seek him without
[30:09] faith it's impossible to please God so
[30:12] we we must believe Christ yes
[30:17] amen so why is conduct order and
[30:19] Doctrine such a big part of the
[30:22] message why does brother brandham labor
[30:24] extensively on this aspect in his
[30:27] sermons while he's preaching Doctrine
[30:29] he'll go into conduct you'll go into
[30:32] order because it is the tutor presenting
[30:35] the syllabus
[30:37] amen
[30:39] amen why why did the the Ministries even
[30:43] our amen our ministers that have gone on
[30:46] why did the labor in conduct order and
[30:49] Doctrine it's to position the
[30:52] church amen to stabilize the church yes
[30:56] amen praise the Lord and I am saying we
[31:00] must never ever forget the conduct the
[31:02] order and the doctrine amen
[31:06] amen amen praise the Lord people think
[31:10] that certain parts of the message we can
[31:12] do away with no we've got to eat the
[31:15] whole book amen we've got to eat the
[31:17] entire word some parts may be bitter but
[31:20] eat
[31:23] it amen follow the instruction
[31:28] so why do the pastors labor with this
[31:30] amen we know it's a syllabus if you
[31:34] fail you will not be position for
[31:36] adoption now remember brother Bram says
[31:40] a son who fails the test remains a son
[31:44] meaning that he's in the Kingdom he
[31:45] hasn't lost his salvation he says but he
[31:48] is without Authority in the Kingdom he's
[31:51] living beneath these
[31:53] privileges amen I don't want to be like
[31:55] that I want to live in the full blessing
[31:58] of the Holy Ghost I want to be like
[32:00] Joshua and Caleb when they walked in the
[32:03] land amen they said this is our
[32:05] inheritance we are more than able the
[32:07] others just want you to remain Sons amen
[32:11] praise the Lord amen so if you fail the
[32:14] syllabus you will not be positioned for
[32:16] adoption the tutor is going to give an
[32:18] honest report you can't go bribe the
[32:20] Holy Ghost now amen the Holy Ghost is a
[32:22] spirit of Truth he can't help but speak
[32:25] the
[32:25] truth amen he's going to give a report
[32:29] to the father how was your conduct how
[32:32] was your order and how was your Doctrine
[32:35] oh
[32:36] yes this is the teaching of the father's
[32:38] Kingdom and how it operates when we say
[32:41] the tutor has to give a good honest
[32:43] report the holy spirit is a spirit of
[32:45] Truth and we know he's going to give a
[32:47] report based on conduct order and
[32:49] Doctrine now conduct is the manner in
[32:51] which a person
[32:55] behaves right a man in which the person
[33:01] behaves is he
[33:05] rebellious does he click his
[33:08] tongue attitude is also very important
[33:10] to conduct what's the attitude towards
[33:13] coming to church
[33:15] Hallelujah all right that's why I was
[33:17] speaking to the church last week what is
[33:20] our attitude when we are coming to
[33:21] church you remember I said why it's so
[33:23] important this is forming part of the
[33:25] report of the tutor hallelujah amen can
[33:28] you follow Church order and Doctrine can
[33:31] you follow what he says about those
[33:34] things going to reminds you some of
[33:36] those things the prophet says a
[33:39] Christian can't wait for the church
[33:40] doors to be open the preparation starts
[33:43] even the night before the week before
[33:45] because they are praying for the service
[33:47] they are praying Lord speak to me speak
[33:50] to me amen speak to
[33:53] me now some of you may be thinking why
[33:55] are you going to this I want you to be
[33:57] position for power amen but you can't
[34:00] bypass this and expect the power of God
[34:03] you can't expect to come into full
[34:05] Authority full sense of authority be
[34:07] able to speak things if you neglect
[34:10] these things this is in fact the
[34:13] discipline that when you don't want to
[34:14] read your Bible you disciplined enough
[34:16] to read it yes
[34:19] amen you know you you know you find time
[34:22] to read the Bible you make
[34:25] time you know you find time to pray
[34:28] you make time
[34:30] yes you know you you hear many people
[34:33] they say I haven't seen you in so many
[34:35] years and you tell them I'm so busy I
[34:37] don't got time but you know if something
[34:38] is important to you you will make the
[34:41] time if this means all the world to you
[34:44] you will make the time you will
[34:46] sacrifice sleep you will sacrifice late
[34:49] hours of the night early parts of the
[34:51] morning and you will make time for the
[34:54] word of God I tell you not you can never
[34:57] lose if you invest your time in the
[34:59] things of God and the word of God you'll
[35:01] be the biggest winner you'll be the most
[35:03] blessed person hallelujah amen you'll be
[35:07] the most rich person rich in love rich
[35:10] in faith rich in kindness rich in good
[35:12] things amen people will love to be
[35:15] around you because you're so full of the
[35:17] word of
[35:20] godall Amen praise the Lord so you may
[35:22] be thinking why you preaching this thing
[35:24] now I don't want Church order conduct or
[35:26] doctrine I'm trying to position the
[35:29] church and show you the importance of
[35:31] conduct order and
[35:35] Doctrine because it's a syllabus for
[35:39] adoption amen praise the Lord so now if
[35:43] I take that word and I say conduct
[35:46] there's another meaning for it the
[35:48] manner in which an
[35:49] organization is managed now I'm going to
[35:51] change the word this is a literal
[35:53] meaning I'm going to say the manner in
[35:55] which the kingdom of God is is managed
[36:00] amen hallelujah yes Lord how many if you
[36:03] know that the kingdom of God cannot
[36:06] operate without you and
[36:09] I if every single man and woman on the
[36:13] earth rejected the gospel the kingdom of
[36:17] God cannot operate right now because
[36:20] Jesus said the kingdom of God is within
[36:22] man amen he's within you the Holy Spirit
[36:26] was not sent to flow to run as a ghost
[36:28] upon the Earth but it was sent to
[36:30] Tabernacle men amen the prophet says we
[36:33] can make the Holy Ghost powerless when
[36:35] we don't allow him to come and have the
[36:37] full Authority in our
[36:40] lives that is why demon powers want to
[36:43] attach themselves to your body
[36:46] and possess you because they also
[36:50] realize they need a body you see there
[36:52] are some things which are spiritual
[36:54] which maybe were not taught or are not
[36:56] taught to the church that that there's a
[36:58] spiritual Kingdom and a spiritual side
[37:00] that
[37:01] operating
[37:03] yes all we see is the five senses and
[37:06] what we can connect with these five
[37:08] senses but right now going through this
[37:11] room amen these pictures voices not only
[37:15] that right now they are angels of God
[37:17] right here right now they are spirits of
[37:19] the enemy right here amen
[37:23] hallelujah so the manner in which you
[37:26] conduct yourself in the kingdom of God
[37:28] is
[37:29] important amen maybe you don't you don't
[37:32] uh you don't want to hear certain things
[37:34] but because you have respect for the
[37:36] kingdom of God you say yes Lord I
[37:37] believe that even when you don't
[37:39] understand it you say yes Lord I believe
[37:41] it amen that's how you're engaging
[37:44] spiritual warfare now because in the
[37:46] kingdom of God this is the spiritual
[37:48] warfare how it's being managed now let's
[37:50] go to our first quot there and show you
[37:52] I want to show you the conduct part
[37:56] quickly he says if I told you the spirit
[37:59] of Christ was in me I must act like
[38:01] Jesus talking about your conduct you
[38:03] must act like Jesus your character and
[38:06] conduct must be molded like
[38:08] that and the Holy Spirit molds that
[38:11] conduct when he comes into you when
[38:13] you're really born again of the spirit
[38:15] of
[38:16] God how many of you want to be more like
[38:19] Jesus more and more and more and more of
[38:22] Jesus Amen less and less of
[38:26] me so what is it how we act conduct how
[38:30] we behave and the Holy Spirit is working
[38:32] on our
[38:34] character amen how's our attendance
[38:37] how's our you know that's part of
[38:38] conduct am you go to school they have a
[38:41] code of conduct what time does a school
[38:44] start you come late they put your name
[38:47] there the monitor loves to take your
[38:48] name down and then they put you in
[38:50] something called
[38:53] detention so we're going to start
[38:56] detention how many feel you like
[38:58] detention amen praise the
[39:01] Lord part of
[39:05] conduct hair
[39:08] covering how are
[39:10] you some of you looking so
[39:12] sad you know you go to school they
[39:15] dictate how you come your hair what you
[39:17] can have and what you can't have you'll
[39:20] allow them to tell you what to do but
[39:22] the house of God must not tell you what
[39:23] to do
[39:25] amen you go into a uh some banks in some
[39:28] places they tell you no helmets
[39:30] allowed they tell you no phones allowed
[39:33] switch your phones off there yes sir yes
[39:35] so three bags full you can copy
[39:37] everything you come in the house you

[39:44] follow the law of the
[39:46] land curfew by 8 all running service at
[39:50] 7even nobody wants to
[39:52] come what is the matter we place more
[39:55] value in the Kingdom of man than the the
[39:57] kingdom of
[40:00] God I tell you seated here is the king
[40:03] is the Sons and Daughters of God who
[40:05] have the authority and the power to
[40:08] operate the kingdom of God in your
[40:10] life but it's our attitude towards
[40:13] things and how we are taking the things
[40:15] of God that are making us live beneath
[40:17] our privileges that's what the prophet
[40:18] of God says our attitude to things our
[40:21] attitude to come into church on time our
[40:23] attitude that's what I was telling you

[42:12] clothed and not only the women are
[42:14] wearing tight clothing men wearing tight
[42:18] clothing so tight you know why gays are
[42:21] designing these clothes so now if gays
[42:24] want to admire other men they make
[42:25] clothing that fits so tight for other
[42:27] men so they get an opportunity to look
[42:28] at these men and Christian men are
[42:31] Fallen prey to this you seen the cified
[42:35] people walk on the streets with shorts
[42:36] pink shorts they're wearing now they

[43:47] things in under
[43:51] conduct so when we come to order of the
[43:53] church in the Kingdom how it functions
[43:56] it functions on spiritual laws God's
[43:58] kingdom is not run up as it amen we
[44:02] don't run our business app as it neither
[44:04] should his kingdom be run up as it God
[44:06] has set order in his church God has set
[44:09] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[44:12] pastors that's God's order in the church
[44:15] God's dress wear that's his Veil and
[44:17] that Veil ought to be respected let's go
[44:19] to the next p brother amen listen to
[44:21] what he's saying God fortified his army
[44:25] with what himself in the form of
[44:27] prophets Hallelujah
[44:30] Apostles teachers pastors what did he do
[44:34] what was God doing listen did you ever
[44:36] think what that officers of the church
[44:38] is it's God's dress inside dress an
[44:42] apostle a prophet a Seer fore before
[44:45] Satan ever gets to it done told it what
[44:48] is it God dressed up in his
[44:51] church amen these officers is God's
[44:54] dress wear when you see those officers
[44:57] pastors teachers evangelists what is it
[44:59] that's God's dress
[45:01] wear God's presence God's
[45:05] spirit working through man and everybody
[45:08] said
[45:09] amen and if that office denies any of
[45:12] this word then it's not God's dressing
[45:15] right working through man and if that
[45:18] office denies okay I'm reading that
[45:20] that's wolf in sheep's clothing now I
[45:23] don't want you you know sheep can also
[45:25] deceive themselves do you know how sheep
[45:28] deceive themselves they pull the wool
[45:30] over their
[45:33] eyes don't deceive
[45:35] yourself you see when it comes to these
[45:38] things and having respects for God's
[45:39] offices we ought to keep that thing it
[45:42] seems that this is lacking in the ranks
[45:44] of the messy church amen but you've got
[45:47] to be able to keep this now he says and
[45:49] if that office denies any of his word
[45:51] then it's not God's dressing that's wolf
[45:53] and sheep's clothing watch that fellow
[45:55] beware of him but when he just takes the
[45:58] word and says remember that's God cuz
[46:00] he's speaking in his
[46:02] word you see and if he says oh oh oh oh
[46:05] my get going sheep get going so if the
[46:08] pastor says get going sheep you ought to
[46:10] get going that's what he's telling
[46:13] you so the doctrine of the church we
[46:15] know Doctrine positionally places the
[46:17] believer positionally amen yeah he says
[46:22] in the spoken word is the Original Seed
[46:24] when the anointed messenger arrives of
[46:27] course he will plant the seed of the
[46:29] entire Bible plant from the serpent to
[46:32] the messenger in the former
[46:34] Reign so he's going to plant the entire
[46:38] seed who the anointed messenger what am
[46:42] i showing you he's going to sww the
[46:44] entire doctrine of the Bible from
[46:46] serpent seed which is from Genesis all
[46:49] the way to Revelation amen the prophet
[46:52] of the age gave us the doctrine
[46:57] L we forget the doctrine of serpent seed
[47:01] the doctrine of baptism in Jesus name
[47:03] the God had revealed Christ The Mystery
[47:05] of God
[47:07] revealed the truth about marriage and
[47:10] divorce who is is mesic amen invisible
[47:14] Union future home what is this doctrines
[47:18] in the Bible amen revelations in the
[47:20] Bible contained in the
[47:22] word hallelujah amen praise the Lord now
[47:26] who is the one that is receiving this
[47:28] word it his only sons who have a gene
[47:31] everybody else hates this message of the
[47:33] hour everybody else can't stand the
[47:35] message of the hour few weeks ago last
[47:38] month when we were doing that Outreach
[47:39] work yeah this man walks past he looks
[47:41] at the speaker and he goes he says
[47:44] that's William brandham so they even
[47:46] know the
[47:47] name I said yes that's William brandham
[47:50] and then he said okay and he walked away
[47:53] so they are not ignorant they even know
[47:56] he's
[47:57] voice imagine that this voice is
[47:59] thundering in the plaza and this man
[48:02] turns and he says he recognizes the
[48:04] voice but I tell you him recognizing it
[48:08] and you recognizing it are two different
[48:09] things when he can recognize it to being
[48:12] William branam you recognize it to being
[48:14] Malachi 4:5 and 6 you recognize it to be
[48:17] Revelation 10:7 you put a scriptural
[48:20] identification to that
[48:24] voice amen praise the Lord so it's only
[48:28] sons of God that can accept this voice
[48:31] Sons because you remember that chicken
[48:33] story in that eagle in the B you're an
[48:36] eagle you're an eagle from birth you
[48:39] wasn't a chicken running there that
[48:40] became an eagle that wasn't a power of
[48:43] transformation there you wasn't a
[48:45] chicken that became an eagle you were
[48:46] always an eagle to begin with you were
[48:49] just in the wrong place
[48:51] yeah your rebirth put a DE to the old
[48:54] nature to bring quickening power upon
[48:56] the SE of God within you then you can
[48:58] truly say If any man be in Christ he is
[49:01] a new creature all things have passed
[49:03] away behold all things have become
[49:06] new now what is this the message of the
[49:09] hour is the land of adoption you can't
[49:11] be adopted any other place you can't be
[49:15] adopted in Pentecost neither can you be
[49:18] adopted in any other denominational
[49:20] Church the message of the hour is the
[49:22] land of adoption amen amen this is where
[49:25] you get your conduct this is where you
[49:27] get your order this is where you get
[49:29] your Doctrine the syllabus for
[49:32] adoption the prophet says you'll never
[49:34] get it until you hide away with God into
[49:37] that land of adoption we've been through
[49:40] this before what is the land of adoption
[49:42] it is right in the shako glory it's not
[49:44] out there in the first Court neither is
[49:46] it out there in the second court amen
[49:49] the second Court requires amen through
[49:51] work those candlesticks require work
[49:53] they carbonized they still need to be
[49:55] cleaned and relit again
[49:59] in fact those seven candlesticks are in
[50:01] that second
[50:03] court with the seven
[50:05] Messengers but when you get behind the
[50:08] holiest of holies amen there's no
[50:10] candlesticks there there's only the Shak
[50:13] glory of God there's only a priest who
[50:16] is commissioned amen for that job
[50:19] there's only a priest who lives his life
[50:21] in service for the king Hallelujah he
[50:23] shut in from the rest of the world a
[50:25] hidden life with God
[50:27] nobody sees his secret life it's him and
[50:30] God
[50:31] alone praise the Lord that is the land
[50:35] of
[50:36] adoption praise the Lord so the prophet
[50:38] is saying you got to get into the land
[50:40] of adoption God is designed that if any
[50:43] man who will be adopted must first be
[50:45] found in the land where adoption is
[50:47] possible you know who you are you know
[50:49] you're a Son of God you know your
[50:51] identity you know amen who we are first
[50:55] and you know in whose family we
[51:00] belong now you can never enjoy your
[51:03] inheritance amen if you are not
[51:05] connected with the word yes if you are
[51:08] not connected now in this hour with the
[51:10] word you are not going to live in the
[51:12] land of your inheritance amen you're
[51:15] going to be living in the glare of
[51:17] another age a glare of another time or
[51:20] somebody's going to position and say
[51:21] look what we are going to be looking
[51:23] into the future but failing to see what
[51:25] you are now amen yes I say like the
[51:28] Bible now are we the sons of God now are
[51:31] we positioned amen yes Lord a son born
[51:34] into a family is no better than a
[51:36] servant unless he's adopted that is why
[51:39] the boy there laying the pig pen he knew
[51:42] he wasn't a doctor he said even the
[51:44] servants in My Father's House are eating
[51:46] better than me I want to go and I'd
[51:48] rather be a
[51:50] servant he knew he was co- equal with
[51:52] the servants in terms of inheritance he
[51:55] was no better than a servant
[51:58] Hallelujah so before we can come into
[52:01] our inheritance and enjoy our
[52:03] inheritance we must undergo undergo a
[52:06] process of growth amen a level of
[52:08] conduct a level of maturity God's not
[52:10] going to place power into hands of
[52:12] people who can't operate this
[52:14] power you must manage finances you must
[52:17] manage his time you must manage things
[52:19] of how is he ever going to have
[52:20] confidence in
[52:25] you the the preparation takes place in
[52:27] the land of adoption I know I know we're
[52:30] not getting many amens
[52:32] today amen if I say Amen speak your car
[52:36] speak your house speak this everyone's
[52:38] jumping and shouting but what I am doing
[52:41] is doing the hard work of teaching you
[52:44] how to become into your position am so
[52:48] maybe you don't want to say Amen now
[52:49] you're missing out on a blessing yes
[52:51] this is the hard part where you need to
[52:53] say Amen even when it goes against the
[52:55] flesh yes amen amen this is the part
[52:57] where you ought to be
[53:01] rejoicing because I I'm going to say
[53:04] this again you did not stray into the
[53:06] [Music]
[53:07] message you're not a stray cat in the
[53:10] message you're a thoroughbred pedigree
[53:12] of God yes the aine of God God in fact
[53:16] designed you for being the message of
[53:18] the hour God called you to the message
[53:19] of the hour this is what you are called
[53:22] for your greatest achievement in life is
[53:24] to be a son and daughter of God amen
[53:27] positionally placed amen hallelujah the
[53:29] message of the hour places us on the
[53:31] grounds of adoption amen the prophet
[53:34] told us amen the prophet is told go back
[53:37] to East and reveal the Seven Seals what
[53:40] is that those Revelations that are
[53:42] contained in the Seven Seals amen who
[53:45] brought down the syllabus yes Lord the
[53:47] syllabus for adoption amen the final
[53:51] syllabus the final word of God
[53:54] Amen when nothing else else could
[53:56] satisfy us yeah amen amen God sent a
[54:00] word not of the earth not touched by
[54:02] man's Creeds by man's ideas amen God
[54:05] sent a
[54:07] word praise the Lord the prophet is told
[54:10] go back and open those seals because
[54:12] those Revelations that are contained in
[54:14] there are necessary to build a man into
[54:16] the full stature Amen to build a man and
[54:19] make him in the likeness of God Amen the
[54:22] adoption material was sent down to the
[54:24] Earth thank you Lord yes amen all those
[54:28] seals must be loosed the prophet of God
[54:30] here in the next message brother amen as
[54:32] I was with Moses see what he says we are
[54:34] looking for the Joshua of this
[54:37] day which is the Holy
[54:39] Spirit to lead us into the
[54:42] land Hallelujah but watch the next verse
[54:45] now if you're looking for him he has to
[54:48] speak through somebody yes
[54:51] hallelujah praise the
[54:53] Lord ah
[54:57] he has to speak to somebody because he's
[55:01] a and a spirit requires a body to speak
[55:06] through I've told you what he's told me
[55:09] now you believe it and be healed amen
[55:13] amen you know if a childlike Faith
[55:15] receives
[55:16] that nothing shall be able to stand
[55:18] before you you have such confidence in
[55:21] the one who
[55:24] spoke you know we Marvel Jesus even
[55:27] marveled at the centurion's faith but if
[55:30] you think about
[55:31] it this man had faith in Jesus Christ
[55:35] but he himself didn't possess the power
[55:37] to
[55:41] speak
[55:42] Hallelujah so I'm saying you are greater
[55:44] than the
[55:45] Centurion you're a Son of God Amen he
[55:49] required Jesus to speak Jesus Is Telling
[55:52] You Greater Works than these shall he do
[55:55] for I go unto my father
[55:58] well nobody believes that amen praise
[56:01] the
[56:02] Lord there's no record of the woman who
[56:06] was caught in the act of adultery that
[56:08] she became a Believer there's no record
[56:11] of it there's no record of people who
[56:13] came and asked to be healed that they
[56:15] became
[56:16] Believers so I'm saying you are called
[56:18] for a higher purpose you are called for
[56:20] higher authority oh yes Lord so watch
[56:24] people are people are taking this p
[56:26] misquoting it when the prophet is saying
[56:28] we are looking for the Joshua of this
[56:30] day which is the Holy Spirit to lead us
[56:32] into the land he has to speak through
[56:35] somebody because he's a spirit he is
[56:38] meaning
[56:39] himself this is not meaning Joseph
[56:43] brandom hello yes don't misinterpret the
[56:47] word just like how he spoke in quoted
[56:49] forms about him being Elijah the prophet
[56:52] and how he spoke in quoted forms about
[56:54] him being revelation 10:7 he's speaking
[56:56] here and saying the spirit of Truth is
[56:58] coming in me
[57:00] amen and he will lead you and guide you
[57:02] into all truth
[57:05] amen it's okay to listen to Joseph
[57:08] Branham because Joseph brandham don't
[57:10] have a message of his own he's telling
[57:12] you to listen to this
[57:14] voice you
[57:18] see so he got no message of his own he's
[57:21] got no prophecy of his own he's only
[57:23] telling you to listen to this voice
[57:27] but this is amen the prophet of the age
[57:30] yes
[57:33] Hallelujah so if he is our tutor under
[57:35] the Holy Ghost we must know the
[57:36] curriculum we must understand the
[57:38] syllabus and the syllabus must be
[57:40] perfected in us we can't just be going
[57:43] around quoting stuff the syllabus
[57:44] becomes perfected in us I am the word
[57:47] made flesh today and now check yourself
[57:51] in the mirror of the word and be sure
[57:55] that your work is
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] true amen check yourself in the mirror
[58:03] of God's word seven angels came down to
[58:05] give him the perfect syllabus for
[58:07] adoption
[58:09] yes but now if it's a syllabus for
[58:11] adoption some people are not studying
[58:13] the
[58:14] syllabus yes so what's going to have
[58:16] exam time come now Jesus only took 3 and
[58:19] a half years from the Jordan to the
[58:22] Cross yes some of our seven years 10
[58:26] years 15 years don't know the syllabus
[58:31] us amen praise the
[58:35] Lord so he sent the Seven Seals not just
[58:39] one thing he sent the entire Bible from
[58:42] Genesis to Revelation he sent the
[58:43] revelation of it that is why amen the
[58:46] prophet said after the preaching of the
[58:47] seal my Bible became a new book
[58:51] Hallelujah he sent the perfect
[58:54] interpretation amen a Capstone
[58:58] Revelation came to the church to give us
[59:00] a perfect understanding amen praise the
[59:04] Lord
[59:07] amen so the ability to speak to a
[59:10] mountain came with a condition
[59:14] yes you must be positioned before he can
[59:17] give you the
[59:18] authority praise the Lord and this is
[59:20] where people are going to fail because
[59:22] remember what brother Bram says if they
[59:23] fail they remain a son we don't want to
[59:26] just remain a son we want to become a
[59:28] redeemed son and daughter of God so
[59:31] power we were saying power without
[59:32] character power with character is foot
[59:34] to rule power without character Satan
[59:36] will use
[59:38] you amen so you must come into the land
[59:40] of adoption the land where the perfect
[59:43] curriculum the perfect syllabus is given
[59:45] you don't just have one word amen you
[59:47] don't have the word alone now that's
[59:49] where some people are also failing
[59:50] they've only got the word no Spirit we
[59:53] want both word and spirit we want both
[59:56] Dynamics and
[1:00:00] mechanics amen and this syllabus I want
[1:00:02] you to know there is no other
[1:00:04] Edition there is no this 2015 Edition
[1:00:08] and now 20 24 Edition the word is the
[1:00:11] same yesterday today and forever it'll
[1:00:13] defeat Satan on any ground any time and
[1:00:17] any place amen the word of God will
[1:00:19] never grow old amen the word of God is
[1:00:21] eternal
[1:00:23] life praise the Lord
[1:00:27] amen amen praise the
[1:00:29] Lord now compromising never ever amen
[1:00:33] compromising has never ever worked we
[1:00:35] can't be compromises in the message
[1:00:38] hallelujah
[1:00:40] amen men in the house I'm going to speak
[1:00:42] to
[1:00:43] you men who are the head of your family
[1:00:45] you are the priest of your
[1:00:48] home God is going to hold you
[1:00:50] accountable as to how you run your
[1:00:53] home so which means you are respons
[1:00:55] responsible for the way your wife
[1:00:57] dresses you are responsible for the way
[1:00:59] your children dress you are responsible
[1:01:01] for bringing them to church come on
[1:01:04] somebody say Amen you're the priest of
[1:01:06] the home so if anybody's going to be
[1:01:09] accountable you are going to be
[1:01:10] accountable the prophet God says we got
[1:01:12] too many sissified men allow the woman
[1:01:14] to run around with shorts and wear all
[1:01:16] kinds of clothing
[1:01:21] sissies God called us into the greatest
[1:01:24] message it can't be now that we are so
[1:01:26] modern that we' forgotten the principles
[1:01:28] of the message amen hallelujah I tell
[1:01:32] you again you want to spend time with
[1:01:33] unbelievers we going to burn in
[1:01:35] hell you don't want to spend time with
[1:01:37] the people of
[1:01:39] God Amen and you know who's going to be
[1:01:43] have the biggest shame you're going to
[1:01:44] hide your head you're going to want to
[1:01:45] go under the ground yourself that
[1:01:48] day the Judgment they're going to look
[1:01:51] at
[1:01:52] you we bride together now my chops are
[1:01:56] being
[1:01:58] bried hey you never told
[1:02:03] me you be an influence to the unbeliever
[1:02:07] yes amen don't let them influence you
[1:02:10] yes
[1:02:13] amen amen men ought to be preached in
[1:02:16] the home leading the home teaching the
[1:02:20] home amen praise the
[1:02:22] Lord because the Bible says the woman is
[1:02:25] a weaker vessel they'll do whatever you
[1:02:28] allow them to do can I get the sisters
[1:02:30] to say
[1:02:34] amen I was expecting you don't say amen
[1:02:36] I was expecting you to say no brother
[1:02:38] even if he allows me to do that I'm
[1:02:39] going to stay with the word but I
[1:02:42] appreciate your honesty because that's
[1:02:43] what women are
[1:02:46] right I guarantee you now very few women
[1:02:49] if the husband leave the message now and
[1:02:50] say that message is false they'll stay
[1:02:56] they're going to say where he leads me I
[1:02:58] will
[1:03:01] follow amen let's bring this to a close
[1:03:03] now amen so what was this the attack on
[1:03:05] the cloud that you seen recently was the
[1:03:08] attack on the message of adoption you
[1:03:10] know why Satan don't want you to be
[1:03:11] adopted Satan's kingdom is finished when
[1:03:13] you are adopted Satan hates this message
[1:03:16] that's why the attack on the cloud he
[1:03:18] doesn't want you to believe this is the
[1:03:19] message of adoption that came
[1:03:22] down L Hallelujah but there's a people
[1:03:25] who took the word amen who said hey this
[1:03:28] is not a rain cloud this is formed by
[1:03:30] seven angels you can say what you
[1:03:33] want Hallelujah these same unbelievers
[1:03:36] would have been there back in the day of
[1:03:38] Moses there when the pull of fire was
[1:03:40] over them over the Red
[1:03:42] Sea they had a pull of cloud and they
[1:03:44] had a pull of fire hanging over them
[1:03:47] they would have said uh we can't find
[1:03:48] the newspaper articles to record this
[1:03:51] the Press didn't take the picture bunch
[1:03:53] of unbelievers same Spirits you know
[1:03:55] Spirits didn't die JIS and jamus didn't
[1:03:58] the spirit that was in them didn't die
[1:04:00] the spirit that was in dayon and Kora
[1:04:02] didn't die Spirits don't die these
[1:04:04] Spirits are here within the framework of
[1:04:05] the message of the hour and we've got to

[1:06:30] hallelujah amen how can we Testify the
[1:06:33] life that I live is no longer the life I
[1:06:35] live now when we're still doing the

[1:06:38] God took us away from our abots when we
[1:06:40] still doing some of us in fact grew up
[1:06:41] very strict in the message and as we got
[1:06:44] older we started to let down the bars we

[1:07:17] now what was the report that the tutor
[1:07:20] gave the father it was now the prophet
[1:07:23] says it was how he conducts himself
[1:07:27] how he follows the
[1:07:29] orders and the teaching you see why c d
[1:07:33] brother the brandom details that he says
[1:07:35] he gives a report whether he's able to
[1:07:37] handle the father's business I want you
[1:07:38] to know the father's business is the
[1:07:40] kingdom of
[1:07:42] Goden yes thank you if God taught us his
[1:07:45] conduct if God taught us his order if
[1:07:48] God taught us his doctrine that is the
[1:07:50] entire syllabus of the
[1:07:53] message amen praise the Lord let's just
[1:07:56] bring it to a close now and we'll read
[1:07:58] here amen let's go to adoption part
[1:08:02] three paragraph 74 now God took you into
[1:08:05] the body of Christ now what does he do
[1:08:08] after you proved yourself Sanctified
[1:08:10] yourself with good behavior conduct
[1:08:12] obedience to the spirit no matter what
[1:08:14] the world says he says I'm going to rub
[1:08:17] this wheale hard I didn't mean to be
[1:08:19] rude please
[1:08:21] don't see I don't want to be what
[1:08:24] wearies me is to take people and preach
[1:08:27] to them this godsend truth and they'll
[1:08:30] turn right back around and just keep on
[1:08:33] doing the same thing and say they got
[1:08:35] the Holy
[1:08:37] Ghost right we know that's deception now
[1:08:39] that's the gates of
[1:08:41] hell that just nearly ruins you see
[1:08:44] what's the matter they come right back
[1:08:46] to the same thing just like the children
[1:08:47] of Israel they wanted a king So this
[1:08:50] King could rule over them and make them
[1:08:52] act like the amorites and the amalekites
[1:08:54] and the Phil times don't do you know
[1:08:57] ladies you see he go straight into the
[1:08:59] conduct now the order do you know ladies
[1:09:01] that it's wrong to wear slacks do you
[1:09:03] know that do you know it's wrong to cut
[1:09:05] locks off your hair do you know it's
[1:09:07] wrong mister for you to continue to
[1:09:09] smoke and act the way you do do you know
[1:09:11] it's wrong for you not for you not to be
[1:09:13] the husband of your house your wife got
[1:09:16] get a little temper spell and kick you
[1:09:18] out the door and say yes bless your
[1:09:21] heart hone I'll come right back do you
[1:09:23] know how can you be a tender at the
[1:09:26] house of God when you can't control your
[1:09:28] own house amen that's exactly right do
[1:09:32] you know sister that your husband is not
[1:09:34] only your husband but he's your ruler
[1:09:36] God said so because that the husband was
[1:09:38] not deceived the woman was deceived and
[1:09:40] your preachers will continue to make
[1:09:42] women pastors and preachers in your
[1:09:44] churches knowing that the word of God
[1:09:46] condemns you you'll continually use that
[1:09:48] name father Son and Holy Ghost to
[1:09:50] baptize when there's not one spec of
[1:09:52] scripture for it in the Bible I want an
[1:09:55] bishop or somebody else to show me where
[1:09:57] anybody in the Bible was ever baptized
[1:09:59] in the name of father son Holy Ghost I
[1:10:01] want somebody to show me anywhere beside
[1:10:04] the name of the
[1:10:06] Jesus right
[1:10:08] Hallelujah so how close are we keeping
[1:10:11] the
[1:10:12] word have we looked into our conduct
[1:10:14] have we looked into our order have we
[1:10:16] looked into our Doctrine because
[1:10:18] remember our life must match the word
[1:10:20] last final quotes now see and then the
[1:10:22] father after he had given the tutors the
[1:10:24] rights to raise his son the tutor had to
[1:10:26] bring word to the father how the son was
[1:10:30] progressing right now he was heir of all
[1:10:34] things but yet he didn't come into legal
[1:10:36] possession until there was a ceremony
[1:10:39] and he had fully done that which was
[1:10:42] right and was worthy now many people is
[1:10:45] in the Earth today and I say this with
[1:10:46] all respect many setting right here who
[1:10:50] absolutely living under your privilege
[1:10:51] as Sons and Daughters of God I won't say
[1:10:54] you'll be lost
[1:10:56] because when God Saves and then he never
[1:10:58] loses them is what he's trying to say
[1:11:00] right I'm not trying to preach Doctrine
[1:11:03] I'm only saying if God now if you not
[1:11:05] mentally walked up but if God Saves you
[1:11:08] knowing he's going to lose you defeats
[1:11:10] his purpose he doesn't do that when he
[1:11:13] saved you you're saved he that heareth
[1:11:15] my words believeth on him that sent me
[1:11:17] at everlasting life right so he says
[1:11:19] you're still a son and daughter but
[1:11:21] you're living under your privilege and
[1:11:23] your conduct
[1:11:26] each day as the Holy Spirit brings it
[1:11:28] before the father gives away the things
[1:11:31] that you
[1:11:33] do amen so how is he giving a report
[1:11:36] daily
[1:11:38] yes amen and you're still a son and
[1:11:41] daughter but you'll never be brought to
[1:11:43] the place where you should
[1:11:46] be now that's a dangerous part right we
[1:11:48] don't want to be like that great gifts
[1:11:51] that are in the church are so
[1:11:53] misused yes
[1:11:56] and can I say are also
[1:11:58] unused great gifts that are in the
[1:12:00] church can be
[1:12:02] unused no reverence to it just a bunch
[1:12:04] of carryon until it brings a disgrace to
[1:12:06] the public how that the Holy Spirit
[1:12:09] would like to govern that bring it down
[1:12:11] the tutor brought the message to the
[1:12:13] father and said the child is progressing
[1:12:15] right or wrong then if it came no matter
[1:12:18] what the outside people had to say about
[1:12:20] this child what the servants and the
[1:12:22] farm man had to say he tried to work
[1:12:25] work every way to please the father and
[1:12:27] no matter what the world has to say
[1:12:28] about you work to please God Amen do
[1:12:31] everything you can to build the kingdom
[1:12:33] of God Amen don't never separate it
[1:12:36] build it together amen hallelujah amen
[1:12:39] final quote now in hear he him then when
[1:12:43] the sun had become to the place of
[1:12:46] accountability say 21 we call it today
[1:12:49] then if the tutor brought word to the
[1:12:51] father and told him everything was fine
[1:12:53] this boy was a gallant man that he was
[1:12:56] zealous of the father's Kingdom and he
[1:12:59] done all he could to improve and EMB
[1:13:01] better the kingdom then this boy what we
[1:13:03] call the placing of a child the father
[1:13:06] take him to a public place set him
[1:13:09] before the public his same son that was
[1:13:11] born into the home years ago all the
[1:13:13] time his son this is what I want to get
[1:13:15] to but his character and his conduct had
[1:13:19] brought him to another
[1:13:22] office how many if you want to get to
[1:13:24] another office
[1:13:25] amen hallelujah I hope you see it the
[1:13:29] character of the Pentecostal Baptist
[1:13:31] Presbyterian Church our character should
[1:13:33] have us up into a place where we can be
[1:13:36] in an office to meet the crisis of this
[1:13:38] hour hello amen the world is in a
[1:13:42] crisis but cood our conduct and our
[1:13:45] order and Doctrine is going to help us
[1:13:48] to meet the crisis of the hour
[1:13:53] hallu see just to reiterate that his
[1:13:57] character and his conduct had brought
[1:13:59] him into another
[1:14:00] office I hope you see spiritually that's
[1:14:03] where we are amen amen bringing us to
[1:14:06] another office to meet the crisis of
[1:14:08] this hour that we in what a shame we are
[1:14:11] but will God answer in the time of
[1:14:12] Crisis watch how God will answer in the
[1:14:14] time of Crisis brothers and sisters he
[1:14:17] will not only answer but he will make
[1:14:20] manifest in the time of Crisis amen how
[1:14:23] is God going to manifest now amen you
