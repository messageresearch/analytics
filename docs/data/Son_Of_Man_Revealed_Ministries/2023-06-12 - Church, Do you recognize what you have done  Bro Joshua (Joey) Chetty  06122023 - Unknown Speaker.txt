therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye believe when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them amen amen let's also turn to Matthew 21 verse 21 Jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if they have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the victory but also if y shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing they shall receive amen amen let's pray father God how we thank you for this day you g to us how we love

speak to me Father God I don't want any of my own thoughts God I want your thoughts to me Father God oh Father God bless Serv pray that those are coming expecting God get what they needed God name of Jesus Christ thank you amen amen amen so I am a bit no it's been like four years since I lasted uh and uh I want to say that when I got the call I was very nervous because I I think I kind of knew what he was ask me for so uh like I I don't have anything long to preach tonight but I want us to Rejoice tonight amen hallelujah and um just after the call I've noticed that devil has been coming my way from last night now uh my old leg Wasing all of a sudden only happening I woke up I had upset stomach and uh today in the room right now there's lots of that updating and it was like wow okay the devil wants to get finished tonight so we finishing tonight amen so we look in the scripture and when you say in Mark 11:23 and he says shall not doubt in his heart amen I feel like the Saints need to really take that much more seriously amen because the prophet he emphasizes every time that we shouldn't have any doubt in our hearts amen before any prayer you say don't doubt but what is doubt okay so a general definition is that is a feeling of uncertainty okay or lack of conviction okay conviction now it is the quality of showing that one is firmly convinced of one of what One Believes or says amen so doubt is such a big problem because it's it's stopping you from having what you want and we need to cancel it out we need to cancel this demon of Doubt so tonight we are tackling this demon of doubt and you're going out there what want amen if you look at what prophet says it says and now this demon of doubt that would hang over the people that would cause him to doubt Satan you have lost the battle for years you've kept Humanity shut in doubt but God in his Mercy has sent us the light and you are a deceiver and you exposed and you have no deer light amen thank you Lord God how how you love God so much you take get rid of doubts you want to be in one Accord amen get rid of the doubts in amen thank you Jesus and we also know that doubt it started all the way in the garden of Ed and doubt is a sin as and we as a bre of Christ must tackle this any any of Doubt don't let it get to you okay amen uh if you look in the Bible also you get Zechariah he had doubt and what did God do to him he shut his mouth amen so what to say he also shut his mouth because he also had a lack of faith why to say that God can to you right now amen we should be fearful amen and we also look at what lack of conviction into our lives so what does it mean it means that people do not have a any true determination to do something to succeed right and another meaning is that a person has lost or not found meaning in what they're doing meaning they don't even know their purpose who they are and what they are and what they are capable of doing but we as the bride of Christ should know who we are what we capable of doing amen we should be strongly convicted by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah am don't go out there living your life doing whatever you want without having this conviction in your Liv amen uh it's very you have to get conviction left so if you go ahead and not pray not read your Bible not stick to the word not keep Godly thoughts in your head nothing positive amen you have lack of conviction and that's stopping you from getting what you want it's causing doubt in your heart amen amen amen let the Holy Spirit bring conviction into your life let it fix you right now amen right now in your seats ask the Holy Ghost to fix you right now get straight get you back in line amen and remember that once you already prayed for it and believe that you received it now this is when you get rid of your doubts this is when you get convicted in your heart amen amen whatever situation you have whether it's Financial whether it's a healing problem whether it's any any sort of problem any small problem remember this with this whole scripture now and it's already yours Hallelujah challenge yourself okay God loves a challenge right and how much more the bread of Christ for love for challenge as well you want to be just like him so challenge yourself amen amen uh have some determination within you amen without any doubt amen amen wonder and if you look at story of the Shad woman you'll see how determined she was yes so if you look at the message of the blind bimus the prophet dramatizes about how um his mother used to tell him how B mother used to tell him about the stories about Elijah the prophet and how bimus caught the the revelation of prophet you know he believed Prophet amen he held on to that amen and if you look at bamus he was physically blind now Prophet says that to be spiritually blind is far more worse than physically blind yes amen but amen when the word came to us when the world was revealed to us our eyes opened am we caught that Revelation yes amen and there's a small sa about spiritual blindness so the prophet says and people are so spiritually blind today though though the Lord God come down in the midst of them and do anything and the things he promised they still can't see it amen they are spiritually blind yes don't know God don't know his great power amen and now if you look back into the story of the shin woman where Elisha told gazi to go to her with a staff right right um but if you look at the woman she didn't want the stuff she didn't she didn't have Fai in that stuff it was in the prophet am said I will not leave you I'm determined to stay with you and hold on till I find out why God took my baby amen she knew if she ever got to him that God would reveal it to him why Took My Baby amen so whatever questions you have within your situation whatever thing is holding you whatever things got you questioning about what's happening hold on we spoke about having Ro Faith about holding on right and now why don't you have that same type for determination to hold on and ask God to beg God what's what's happening amen because the prophet says I like that determination too she was determined to hold on unto it yes when something's wrong and you can't understand take a hold of God and hold onto him so something answers just don't be well I prayed last night and I haven't heard yet so I guess he doesn't answer no more but the prophet says hold on to him just keep holding on and I will not leave you be like Jacob westle all day and night as he do with the angel I'll not leave you amen yes amen and the the church shouldn't forget that we have a six sense you shouldn't be forget forgetful about that and it sometimes we have the faith but we unconscious about it Prophet speaks about that amen it's like it's like you know you have eyes that can see but you chose to close your eyes and walk yes amen and says your fate is unconscious don't press now or jump you jump away from it it's right with you just relax yourself just believe now and have faith amen and be reverent just have faith just believe sometimes your faith is unconscious you have it and you don't know it amen I want you tonight to tap in to that six sense I want you to forget physical senses I want you to use a spiritual man and tap in to that six s tonight amen when you going out here you use the six sense you speak what you want Remember by faith you are saved and by faith you can Channel anything you want you want healing you can get it into Faith amen amen hallelujah am amen Prophet says now Faith is not healing Faith produces healing amen amen so you can't uh now you can have faith for healing and I believe many of you many of you have faith for healing right amen amen amen it amen amen but you can't receive healing until you purchase healing by the faith that you have amen amen faith is really simple that people compicated so much because of our physical body and our kindal minds that yes the prophet says how simple Fai is like for instance you can't move out of your seats if you're able to come if you're able to come sit down you can move out of your seat if you don't believe it but you know that you can move out of your seat right and just like you canot put your hat on um not if you don't believe it you can put your hat on but you know you can put your hat on your head right yes now yesterday I read the I read the testimony of on the group chat uh I like f have you ready amen it it inspired me for today's message and how she believed that she knew that if she asks it she'll get it she didn't have any doubts and that child like fate was so inspiring that I just had to tell you today um about that and how simple it is you know to have childlike Fai and you'll get what you want you got healed amen yes amen amen and then um maybe this is quite simple for you all uh small case I mean um so like my exams are uh testing and ethic for me that so two weeks ago I wrot this one paper and I learned a lot of it and but when I went to examp I blanked out blank out so told myself you know what just come down have War water then look back at the PA but then I was looking nothing wasn't speaking to me so right there I said to myself God take over give me the answers to this question amen God help me out through this and God gave me just enough information to write on the paper two weeks later I had my result and he just managed to make me pass and you have no idea how I was reing I was lening the car of my friends and I was rejoicing I was so happy like amen God really saw through me again in my life it meant a lot to me and also remember that it happened to me when I was in grade seven that year I got baptized uh I gave my heart to L so well it I was small that time but I remember asking God in that paper to help me get and instantly it revealed to me what what I have amen and it's it meant so lot so much to me it's I carried on to my life that in the simple things like that God can help you through amen that's why you can start small like remember small thank amen thank you and faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil amen amen faith is the victory faith in what not faith in a church not faith in a GED not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise that's the victory what is it it's the victory amen so you may say my arm is crippled my back is paining or I feel sick but faith is the victory yes it overcomes the world amen amen but before you can have faith there has to be a battle amen and if there's no battles there's no Victory amen so we ought to be thankful for the battles and the tri and it's God God giving us the opportunity to have victories God wants you to have claim your own Victory by going to your own battles amen he wants you to use your faith amen the faith that he gave to you to use amen amen praise the Lord and he said don't take don't take make it make you a little better now the battle came along somebody saying something bad about you sickness come upon you maybe God give you the give you those light afflictions that he might heal you and show you his savior to you let you see what he means by it he loves you amen amen amen and we look at how to have faith amen now in order to have faith faith has to be a basis amen so you you can't you just can't let Faith be loose and wild amen faith has to vest itself not upon the shifting Sands of man's reasoning faith is based on the solid block God's word amen Faith rest right in God's word amen amen amen this came to me now I forgot to mention so as I was coming to yeah I was thinking of probably a title was exaltation and looking at how the Y went for us I was thinking of calling it church do you recognize what you have done amen do you recognize how many demons you have slain this year how many demons are scared of you right now amen sure amen how many demons are be scared tonight too amen I want us rejoicing tonight amen amen I want us filled with the spirit tonight thank you amen so okay so Prophet says that faith is really beginning to operate out among people has this been happening to us this year amen you keep that up you going to see something happen you just remember that you you're getting kind of so used to you watch you're watching now you see what's taking place you begin to believe him it's an 80% different tonight than what it has been any night it'll go to moving among you if you only have Fai that's all you ask for I have faith in God Amen and Faith knows no defeat faith is perfect BRS things when there's no things to be brought amen Faith creates Faith takes doubt away amen takes negative and makes positive amen thank you Lord faith is not mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolutely fundamental result that happens in a person's heart amen When Faith is appropriate then it is appropriated then it is something in the person's heart but it can't be based on well go touch a tree and you get well or TR to the post it's got to have a foundation amen and also uh this scripture was a blessing to me on Sunday and I know that it was mentioned beginning year or I think it was just before the year started where B mentioned to uh write down the vision amen and um I like to read the scripture in fact remember uh the Lord word the Lord's word never fails right it's Eternal and this words still lives which is why you still see the power of the scripture amen remember what God say what the Lord say that say the Lord amen and so habac 2 verse 2 um and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readed it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it car wait for it because it will surely come yes amen it will not tell amen amen thank you it will come amen no matter what he said he will come remember God has an inheritance for you it was given to you before you even knew it amen he thought about you before the foundation of the world Amen he knew it was going to be yours yes amen thank you Lord but what are you doing are you cling it amen amen yes our bodies are groing and we have an inhabitance and we are children now head of the Kingdom Kings and priest unto God offering spiritual sacrifices and while we graning veil in his this Tabernacle of humiliation we have the earnest of our perfect of a perfect complete Redemption back while amen back like we was in the beginning when God created Adam in the Garden of Eden amen we have a full Taste of GL The Vine by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the refreshment coming from the presence of God Amen to water the church to make it grow in Grace amen and when we sick we have Redemption the blessing the attribute of attributes of the death of Christ Divine Healing as a false sign to us that someday this model will take on immortality amen yes amen don't you want immortality yes amen don't you want a body change amen you can have it right now amen amen but we need some Christians that are not jellish but with a back bone and he say I don't need to fuss with people but stand for your god-given light that Christ died for you amen not pushed around we don't have to be no s we got an inheritance amen and our inheritance belongs to us it's our privilege to have anything that you inherited to accepting Jesus Christ and dying to yourself amen and Satan Satan said well I'll I'll tell you what I'm going to do well when Satan may try to push you down may may try to cause thoughts cause doubts but you ahe the amen Satan can't stand you because you have so much power and authority amen he couldn't stand that we was given dominion over the Earth amen hallelujah that's why he chose to come down and pervert it amen he thought he won but he already lost amen say you tell him I know my position in class amen and you just might as well get away I ain't listening to you anymore and got an inheritance amen well Satan may say now I'm going to take you prematurely I'm going to do this and you say no you're not we got a title to the property of ours that's right and we got an an attorney setting in glory amen when BL sacrifice of his own life not only that but we got an FBI agents amen the holy spirit amen uh God's Great detective just leave the blood and serve the W of him watch the Holy Ghost put him out amen yes there you are whosoever will let him come amen amen amen all the scriptures may sound very familiar to y am I I was looking reading and taking and remembering everything that's toward the amen but this word is still special in us hallelujah still this word still has power amen thank you amen and we also we also need to work on our spiritual diets and what we're feeding on Amen we should desire more and more of the word amen you know just like how leprosy is caused from the wrong diet amen just like that sin causes the wrong spiritual diet amen feed it's you need to feed that spiritual man within you don't deprive it don't deprive it from the blessings amen don't make it a sick man don't drive yourself into sin okay this spiritual man groans within you it's groaning for its inheritance amen it desires more and more from God desires to be filled with the Holy Ghost so keep yourself in fail keep feeding on the word leave these natural things behind amen quit feeding on all these Natural Things amen quit it leave separate yourself from the world Amen notice now Jesus invested with all the powers of God but when he met Satan he never used any of his powers he only referred to the word amen he did he said it is written man should not live by very alone but by every word that proceeded out of the of God then how how can you say you can stay at home and be just just a good Christian as you would be at church you can't do it amen you have to read the word the Holy Spirit feeds on the word amen Bible is God's spiritual diet for his church and the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to you and places it in the heart and with Thanksgiving you want it and every Divine promise will promise just exactly what God said he would do it's got to amen it's the word and it's life amen amen and if you ever feel that along your life there a lot of testing and trial times remember these angels are there to come remember that the angels that will give you Faith the angels that will move you along amen God has a host of angels all up and down the ladder amen look at Exodus 23: 23 for my angel shall go before thee amen and bring thee in bring theee in unto the amorites and the hites and the parasites and the Canaanites and the hites and the jeites and I will cut them off amen and through those tough times you you get to also say I can do all things to Christ amen believe in him amen feel blessed amen amen amen how many of you love the Lord am thank you Jesus amen amen so the prophet also says you're pushing it way off out to the Millennium somewhere all the blessings are in the Millennium why it's right now we won't need the healing in the Millennium amen we have it now so take it amen clim it use it we won't be Son of God but now you are sons of God Amen you a head you are joint head for Jesus and everything that Jesus died for at Calvary is your position amen amen but Satan don't like that because if the people would only realize and just be willing to take on God's word you it would be unlimited amen his power is unlimited and that's what Satan is so scared about he's scared about his blad coming in full power and amen we are at that stage amen amen believe that we are at that stage yes amen and John 14 verse 12- 14 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I shall do that I do shall he do also and works that he shall do because I go unto my father amen and whatsoever yes ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son amen if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it amen if you love me keep my Comm Commandments amen do you love you amen you should be rejoicing right now said it amen he said that also if you love him you'll keep his word amen need claim all the promises that's why it's really important to keep on reading the Bible it there you know there's like over like 7,000 promises in the Bible right so why cry why came promises he said he will never leave you not forsake you Hebrews 135 he said that he's always with us he will never forget us he chose us amen he watches our lives and keeps us from harm strengthens us and helps us meets all our needs amen and Peter said on the day of pen because these promises is to you and your children and them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen and when they met when they met acts 238 God honored the check went to the queen Clearing House and yet it come back they begin to speak in tongues and prophesy magnify God Amen and God when a Believer signs his name as a Believer and passes through God's Pentecostal Clearing House with the baptism of the Holy Ghost God will pay off every promise and everything else amen his bank is good amen this is God's economy amen amen promises are real amen everything signs in Jesus name amen can't sign no other way won't work he don't he don't know no titles amen he only knows the name amen believe that amen thankes just his name is the only thing that's needed so ask the father anything in my name amen amen amen yes amen and we also out to have the mind of Christ within us amen the bride needs to have him within us so we have to reflect him through our land so Romans 8 Romans chapter 8 verse6 for to be kindly minded is dead but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the caral mind is enity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in spirit amen if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of this and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin yes amen but the spirit is life because of righteousness amen but the spirit of him that rais up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that rais up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen you got to die to every thought of the flesh amen you got to die to every thought of the flesh so that you can receive the mind of Christ and walk hence forth not of your own but of his mind amen the mind of Christ in you that's the only way you can stay alive am amen amen and the God God hates the human mind he doesn't like the way the human mind works okay the same thing so the prophet says the same things will blind the eyes of the carnal man because it can't understand things of God it's against God it's the enemy of God yes human mind is the enemy to God you got to get out of your own human mind and be born a new by the holy spirit amen and get the mind of God within you then you can believe those things then it becomes a reality amen amen and Philippians 2:5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus amen so what happens when the mind of Christ comes within you when Christ comes into the heart then he comes into the mouth then he comes into the eyes he comes into the Mind amen he comes into into the mouth it makes you talk different you don't like you don't talk like you used to amen Christ got into your mouth amen done grow now from your heart uh your love your love you have for him so you can B down but that's a great thing amen and then the next thing you know it grows into your eyes the next thing you know you find out the old as things that you used to look at you'll turn away from it am and the first thing you know still turn your head but you're thinking but after a while it grows into your mind you don't even think about it so you're just a full grown creature now you're a full brand new creature that has no no tast that doesn't want any Taste of his world have the mind of Christ within you amen and that's such a gor thing and such a beautiful thing to have amen and when the bride has the mind of Christ you'll notice the harmony of the father and the son yes Jesus Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 59 this harmony is now to exist between the Grom and his bre amen he he showed her his Word of Life she received it she never doubted amen therefore nothing can harmer amen not even debt amen for if the seed be planted the water will rise will raise it up again amen here is a secret of this the word is in the Bri as it was in Mary uh the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word amen performs the command of the word in his name amen and she has thus say the Lord amen then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass amen amen amen amen you heard I think was two weeks you heard the message about character with power SP will amen now your mind makes your character amen so then when we let his character being in us then we can we have become Sons by having the mind of Christ amen for his character your mind makes your character Amen Let The Mind Paul said of Christ this mind that was in Christ be in you amen it molds the character of the Son of God Amen and if you want angels to appear to you you need to keep your mind on God sh the world out hallu keep thinking of him amen keep talking about him amen keep rejoicing keep having you have to s that battle in your mind amen and there is this surrender ourselves I've often thought about why we deprived ourselves how we rob God of his plan by not surrending our lives completely to him yes amen everything that we have how that we have disallowed his program how we Ling it and have made him to wait and wait trying to find somebody that he work to trying to find a man somewh that he could put confidence in some man that will surrender everything amen but we will be that person amen we will surrender ourselves amen so he can work through us we can't we can't deive ourselves like this amen our blessings right amen thank you Lord amen you need to surrender your life to make him use you amen him come in you amen let him make you new again amen you will see the full power being manifested when you when you surrender yourself to God Amen God wants to fully surrender Church am so so you can walk through amen walk through God wants his surrendered blood so how many of youall want to be surrendered this evening Hallelujah don't leave this buring without being surrendered Amen Let quotes Prophet also says if the church will hold the name of Jesus esteem it and honor it and quit using it in slang and so forth and use it in the power and rence it will conquer every enemy that God God Amen and in my name they shall cast our devil Amen in my name they shall lay hands on the sick all things in his name amen and what we need today amen is a good oldfashioned St Paul and the prophet always emphasizes it and we need to take action on that we need to bring that amen why not tonight amen amen bring back to the church again signs wonders and miracles time for everything but the right thing amen amen oh thank you Lord love him thank okay so has this thought on the eagle um so you know that we already should be at a stage where we already out of the chicken amen we already up in the air flying amen amen but now you now this Eagle amen needs to keep on feeding amen so every day it's feeding feeding and feeding and feeding it's feeding bigger Meats every day he learning new gaining more knowledge gain more fa amen but it's only got the mechanics it needs the Dynamics so we need to also fulfill scripture to go out and prophesy to those amen yes so what he does is the eagle goes out and Scouts it looks and he he looks back to the
