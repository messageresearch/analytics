[2:54] Revelation and uh I love how Paul always
[2:59] talks about
[3:00] preaching Christ H not not preaching
[3:04] about Christ but preaching Christ that
[3:07] the gospel that we preach is Christ amen
[3:10] and because this message of the hour
[3:12] reveals Christ and when Christ is
[3:16] revealed we are revealed it tells us who
[3:19] we are and we know that that is the key
[3:24] for the Rapture amen that when the bride
[3:26] knows who she is the rapture takes
[3:29] Hallelujah and that's exactly what is
[3:31] unfolding in us that is what's unfolding
[3:33] with all the ministration of the word
[3:37] revealing Christ revealing you so that
[3:40] soon and very soon we may be with him
[3:43] may his Blessing rest upon you may bless

[4:25] our Bibles
[4:27] to the book of 2 Chronicles reading from
[4:30] chapter
[4:32] [Music]
[4:34] 7 I'm going to speak on a few things
[4:37] that was already spoken by past Adan and
[4:39] myself during the course of the year
[4:41] just to bring to you in remembrance and
[4:43] to put things in context amen uh I
[4:46] believe that the Lord is
[4:47] always taking us back to certain things
[4:51] to establish us amen
[4:57] amen and then from there we look at
[5:00] where the Lord is working right now amen
[5:03] cuz I believe the gospel is Progressive
[5:05] amen yes amen the gospel is oh we also
[5:08] have another brother visiting us God

[5:15] this
[5:16] morning I don't know if there's any
[5:17] other visitors I pray that the Lord will
[5:19] bless each one of you amen so you find
[5:21] that the the the gospel is there to take
[5:24] us somewhere amen amen because the
[5:27] gospel is not there to give us religion
[5:30] we not just here as a form of religion
[5:32] to come week after week and here a
[5:34] sermon this gospel is taking us on a
[5:37] journey amen Redemption is a complete
[5:40] work amen Redemption must take us back
[5:43] to the original condition that we was in
[5:46] the condition that man fell from In the
[5:49] Garden of Eden amen amen so it didn't
[5:51] just stop at Calvary amen it was
[5:54] progressing amen yes so it goes beyond
[5:58] what people think religion uh this this
[6:00] walk this Christian walk is about it's
[6:03] about taking us back to our rightful
[6:06] condition am you take us back to what
[6:08] was lost amen and it couldn't be done in
[6:10] any other age but it had to be done in
[6:12] the adoption age it had to be done in
[6:15] the time when the when the church was
[6:18] ready to come amen the body of Christ
[6:20] could come right now ready for the
[6:22] edstone amen you have to be in this age
[6:25] when The Headstone came down to connect
[6:27] with the body am now we have the mind of
[6:30] Christ and when we have the mind of
[6:32] Christ now we are seated here in
[6:34] Heavenly places in Christ
[6:37] Jesus amen the book of Chronicles
[6:39] chapter
[6:44] 7 now when Solomon had made an end of
[6:48] praying the fire came down from
[6:53] heaven amen and consumed the burnt
[6:57] offering and the sacrifices
[7:00] and the glory of the Lord filled the
[7:03] house
[7:05] amen and the priest could not enter into
[7:09] the house because the glory of the Lord
[7:12] had filled the house amen
[7:16] amen we also turn now to the book of egi
[7:20] chapter 2
[7:30] book of ha chapter
[7:45] 2 in the seventh month in the 1 and
[7:49] 120th day of the month came the word of
[7:53] the Lord by the prophet AGI is saying
[8:03] speak now to zerubabel the son of chel
[8:06] governor of
[8:09] Judah and to Joshua the son of josc the
[8:14] high priest now we find that
[8:18] uh
[8:20] zerubabel would have been the king of
[8:22] Judah had they been in in their Kingdom
[8:25] but yeah they are in captivity yeah
[8:28] under the Persian rule so he is the
[8:31] governor and we find
[8:33] that Joshua being the high priest he's
[8:37] coming from the levitical priesthood
[8:40] lineage because you cannot be a priest
[8:42] uh unless you come from the litical
[8:45] lineage you cannot be a king unless you
[8:49] come from it's Ed it's edit right you
[8:52] have to come from the line of Judah amen
[8:54] so to Joshua the son of remember all
[8:57] this is happening now around about 500
[8:59] some BC the high
[9:03] priest now we know so said if they
[9:06] wasn't under that persan Dominion he
[9:07] would have been
[9:09] King and what Joshua means Jehovah
[9:11] savior amen amen
[9:14] amen and to the residue of the people
[9:17] saying who is left among you that saw
[9:22] this house in a first
[9:26] Glory so there was a house in his first
[9:28] Glory
[9:30] and that's what the one we read now in 2
[9:31] Chronicles 7 the the house that Solomon
[9:35] buils when the sh Glory came down
[9:39] amen when Solomon we know that when
[9:42] Solomon built the temple it was the type
[9:45] of the
[9:46] Bride amen because when you think about
[9:49] the temple do not think of a physical
[9:51] building let's come up a little higher
[9:54] this morning amen am the word has come
[9:56] to open our eyes of understanding amen
[9:59] when we look at it when you think about
[10:00] a temple we think about a physical
[10:02] building but we are the temple of God am
[10:05] and the temple is St being
[10:07] gind and when Solomon went to the temple
[10:09] he's typing Christ but greater than
[10:12] Solomon is here
[10:15] amen
[10:17] amen and how do you see it now is it not
[10:20] in your eyes in comparison of it as
[10:24] nothing amen so when you look at the
[10:27] bride when you look at your brother and
[10:29] sister
[10:29] you have to see them through the
[10:32] blood you have to see them
[10:34] faultless you have to see them as Christ
[10:36] sees
[10:38] them yet now be strong oh zerel say the
[10:41] Lord and be strong oh Joshua son of jedc
[10:46] the high priest and be strong all ye
[10:49] people of the land say the Lord and work
[10:52] for I am with you say the Lord of hosts
[10:57] am amen so you all go all of the fults
[11:00] and everything there God shows the AI
[11:04] the prophet he said I am still with you
[11:06] amen you see God keeps his own Covenant
[11:09] amen because this covenant not you or I
[11:13] do amen it's what he
[11:16] promised and God swore by an O to
[11:19] confirm this Covenant Hallelujah you can
[11:22] deny him but he don't deny you thank you
[11:24] Lord Peter denied him but he didn't deny
[11:27] Peter to give him the baptism of the
[11:29] Holy Ghost amen you may be seated sorry
[11:32] for
[11:35] that and verse 5 says according to the
[11:39] word that I covenanted with you when you
[11:42] came out of
[11:44] Egypt so my spirit remained among you
[11:48] amen fear ye not now that I'm thinking
[11:52] that I'm reading this and this is
[11:54] referring to the time when it was under
[11:56] Persian rule we know the the ancient
[11:58] Persian ire is now Iran and and and
[12:01] while we were sleeping last night
[12:03] Iran attacked Israel they send drones
[12:06] out there to
[12:10] Israel so fear ye not for thus say the
[12:14] Lord of host yet once it is a little
[12:18] while and I will shake the heavens oh

[12:25] the dry
[12:26] lands and I will shake all na Nations am

[12:59] is the time where Israel is now back in
[13:02] the
[13:04] Homeland amen so all the focus is there

[13:32] message was stood up for her from every
[13:34] nation from every tribe and every
[13:36] Kindred God has been dealing with her
[13:39] and we find that the church World left
[13:41] Christ they put him out of the church
[13:43] the minute they put him out of the
[13:44] church he started working with his bride
[13:46] amen and then when he started working

[14:05] Holy
[14:06] Ghost amen

[14:13] little while and I will shake the
[14:15] heavens and the earth and the Sea and

[14:40] Not Just in any house yes God doesn't
[14:44] just go and put his glory

[15:27] H was already gone but he was talking
[15:29] about the glory that was in the first
[15:31] house but now there was another house

[15:38] years because now it's the end of the 70
[15:41] years and now the decree is given for to

[15:50] find in the Book of Solomon that sh of
[15:53] Glory comes down but this house that's
[15:56] going to be ready now is not going to be
[15:58] the glory of God coming down as it was

[33:31] your position that's where you'll
[33:32] receive your blessings amen
[33:36] amen so we find that in the book of
[33:41] uh when during the Daniel's time when
[33:44] the the 70 years was about to run
[33:47] out and Daniel began to pray and when
[33:50] did he pray he prayed at the evening
[33:53] time amen at the ending of the 70 years
[33:57] of captivity
[33:58] but who came down Gabriel came
[34:03] down but it wasn't it didn't just come
[34:06] down he was stopped by the Prince of
[34:09] Persia yes
[34:13] right but Michael come comes on the
[34:16] scene amen and makes a way for Gabriel
[34:19] to come Amen to explain to Daniel all
[34:23] these things amen
[34:25] right he came down to bring Revelation
[34:29] that was
[34:30] previously not revealed nobody knew
[34:33] these things but he comes and reveals it
[34:35] to
[34:36] Daniel Amen and this Revelation that
[34:40] he's giving to Daniel now is going to
[34:42] start the process amen of changing the
[34:45] dwelling place amen from captivity oh
[34:49] yes Lord to go back and rebuild
[34:54] Jerusalem amen amen that was going to
[34:57] the process by the angel coming down to
[35:01] Daniel and giving him this
[35:07] Revelation amen and we find that the
[35:10] same thing happened in this day when the
[35:12] when the prophet was
[35:13] there and he knew that he preached all
[35:17] these things and he tied up all the
[35:18] Loose
[35:19] Ends but he said of waiting for a
[35:22] message I I preach what Paul preached
[35:26] but now I'm waiting for a message
[35:28] amen and the Lord showed him the vision
[35:32] that this is what's going to happen and
[35:34] in the dream or Vision you had and you
[35:37] were those people were coming to the the
[35:39] municipality was coming to do some
[35:40] construction there at the
[35:42] roadside and he said when you see that
[35:44] sign it's time to go west remember when
[35:48] he was younger he said you'll always be
[35:49] successful in the
[35:51] west amen but the Lord was referring to
[35:53] this amen the greatest the capping of
[35:56] his ministry amen yes amen
[35:59] amen and we find that he goes in the
[36:04] west and we and remember he preaching
[36:07] 962 Serv is this the sign of the end yes
[36:10] the recorded message telling you yes
[36:13] what's going to unfold
[36:16] amen prior to it
[36:18] happening and yet the critics want to
[36:21] deny what happened but is recorded amen
[36:25] exactly what's going to happen amen and
[36:27] he's taking the scripture the exact
[36:30] scripture
[36:32] amen and then it happens because God
[36:36] interprets his word by making it come to
[36:38] pass yes amen amen amen and a scriptural
[36:42] Prophet must go back a prophet a script
[36:44] must go back to the word amen being a
[36:46] scriptural prophet he must go back to
[36:48] the word he must take it from the
[36:50] scripture amen he doesn't go by feelings
[36:53] and emotions must bring it back to the
[36:55] word amen line upon line precept upon
[36:58] precept here a little there a little
[37:02] amen amen and then he brings it back to
[37:04] the word and shows that now it's coming
[37:07] to the at the end of the seventh Church
[37:09] age coming to the end of the seventh
[37:11] Church age now the church was put
[37:14] out but now this is time now for God to

[39:05] word this is
[39:06] you when you saw Esther there that is

[41:32] taught through generations
[41:36] yes to believe that there was a great
[41:39] Supernatural God put quote number
[41:43] two it was easy for the Jews who had
[41:46] been taught through generation to
[41:48] believe they were a great Supernatural
[41:51] God but to think that God had come down
[41:55] and was manifesting himself s to the
[41:57] person of his son Jesus Christ God
[42:01] tabernacled in a body of Flesh that was
[42:04] a little too much for them to
[42:06] understand but he said now as you
[42:09] believed in God believe also in me amen
[42:13] for in my father's house are many
[42:17] mansions and I go to prepare a place for
[42:20] you Jesus life was fixing to end here on
[42:23] Earth he had shown the people and proed
[42:26] to them that he was Jehovah manifested
[42:29] in flesh by the great signs and wonders
[42:33] and the reference of the Bible that he
[42:34] had referred to to himself and he proved
[42:37] that he was God
[42:38] manifested now he said when you see my
[42:41] life ending it's ending for a purpose
[42:45] and I'm going away to prepare a place
[42:47] for you that where I am there you may be
[42:49] also G Jesus therefore is telling his
[42:52] disciples that his life is not ended in
[42:55] depths and we know at his Ascension is
[43:00] that the angel of God said to the
[43:01] disciple when you see him you shall be

[43:06] prepared a better body for us amen that
[43:09] we going to have a glorified body amen
[43:12] and you can't have a glorified body if
[43:15] you first didn't receive the Passover

[43:27] the Holy Ghost amen and when you got the
[43:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you
