[3:55] services
[3:57] amen also at this time
[4:00] it's like to say happy and blessed
[4:03] birthday to Josephine is God is 15 years
[4:06] ago God has blessed us with his bundle
[4:08] of joy in our home and we thank God for
[4:13] I know when Joshua was born it was like
[4:16] justification when Caleb was born it was
[4:18] like
[4:19] sanctification when Josephine was born
[4:21] it was like the baptism of the Holy
[4:23] Ghost amen because when Joshua was born
[4:26] I just had an experience I wanted to
[4:28] know this God I had a contact with this
[4:31] God that we heard about in the Bible and
[4:34] I wanted us to find this God but we were
[4:37] still stuck in the
[4:39] denomination amen and I started to get
[4:42] get the me all of the message and as
[4:44] Caleb was born we already come in the
[4:46] message and then we got
[4:48] baptized and We Know by the time
[4:51] Josephine was born we said now we are
[4:52] ready to cross over
[4:55] jordanah amen so we thank God for the
[4:57] blessings that he's given us amen
[5:01] amen if you love the
[5:03] Lord and you're thankful to God for the
[5:05] things that he's doing and the way world
[5:09] is progressing amen now these things
[5:12] can't come from man because as men we
[5:14] have our own thoughts and our own ideas
[5:17] but it's
[5:18] limited but when we receive from the
[5:20] inexhaustible Fountain of Life his
[5:24] mercies are renewed every day amen and
[5:27] we find that his word comes fresh to was
[5:30] fresh
[5:31] manner every day
[5:33] amen and we thank God for the 54
[5:35] Ministry and we appreciate the five4
[5:38] ministry because without the five4
[5:41] ministry we won't have we won't be
[5:43] receiving because they have the source
[5:45] of
[5:46] communication amen we believe that the
[5:48] angel of God is here and he's speak
[5:50] which is the Holy Ghost and he's using
[5:53] the 54
[5:54] Ministry for the perfecting of the
[5:56] Saints amen and the five4 ministry has
[5:59] to to bring edification to bring the
[6:01] church into Perfection amen amen and to
[6:04] bring you into the knowledge of Christ
[6:07] and so we appreciate that we appreciate
[6:09] the things that God is doing if if we
[6:11] just say we want to sit at home and
[6:14] we've got the message we'll read our
[6:16] Bibles but we not we don't have not
[6:19] everybody has that gift God has given
[6:22] these gifts in the church for a
[6:23] reason you can be reading your Bible and
[6:27] reading the scripture over and over but
[6:29] there's things there that you will not
[6:31] see because you haven't received that
[6:34] communication but God has anointed men
[6:38] in his hour I mean if God wanted he
[6:41] could have came and spoken directly to
[6:43] somebody but God uses men and that is
[6:47] law amen and God can't change that law
[6:51] now God anoints men and he drops his
[6:54] word down in that man and that man can't
[6:56] speak anything but but the word that God
[6:59] is putting his
[7:00] mouth amen and then when you are
[7:02] connected with
[7:04] that then there must be a change taking
[7:06] place in you you see
[7:09] because if we look at at the veil at the
[7:13] gifts God given us and we look at it
[7:16] carnally then we only enjoy the
[7:18] blessings of God but we got to look at
[7:21] it we got to be
[7:22] sensitized yes to the Unseen World we
[7:26] got to look Beyond the Veil and see what
[7:28] God is using using in the hour when he's
[7:30] using it amen and when we look Beyond
[7:33] the Veil and recognize God is speaking
[7:35] to
[7:36] us and then you can receive of God and
[7:40] then that can transform and change your
[7:43] lives and that can word can do something
[7:46] for
[7:47] you amen remember like Elijah and Elijah
[7:50] said Lord open the boy's eyes because he
[7:53] was looking through the five senses
[7:55] because we all are Tre here in the three
[7:57] dimensional World which is light matter
[7:59] and
[8:00] time but we've got to come to the six s
[8:03] which is through
[8:04] faith we got to look at the Unseen amen
[8:08] amen amen so you've got your Bibles
[8:10] today let's let's open to the book of 2
[8:13] Kings chapter 1 the book of 2 Kings
[8:17] chapter
[8:19] 1 so we are glad to be found in the
[8:21] presence of God and we can if you look
[8:24] around the world what God is doing
[8:25] amongst the bride
[8:31] it's a glorious time
[8:34] amen and we can see the events around
[8:36] the world what's happening because we
[8:38] know between the second W and the third
[8:40] W something is taking place amen God is
[8:44] dealing with his Gentile
[8:47] bride and
[8:49] also at the closing of the time of him
[8:52] dealing with the Gentile dispensation
[8:54] there must be a Passover a crossover to
[8:56] deal with the Jews amen
[9:00] but this is where we are now amen in our
[9:02] part of the
[9:03] prophecy 2 Kings chapter
[9:07] 1 let's read from second king chapter 1
[9:28] [Music]
[9:47] okay 2 Kings chapter 2 reading for
[9:49] verses 1 to
[9:50] 11 2 Kings chapter
[9:57] 2 and it came to pass when the the Lord
[9:59] would take up
[10:01] Elijah into Heaven by a
[10:05] whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha
[10:09] from gilgal you see it came to pass that
[10:13] the Lord would take up
[10:15] Elijah now Elijah decides to go to
[10:18] heaven the Lord would take him up
[10:22] amen and Elijah said unto Elisha terer I
[10:26] pray thee for the Lord had sent me to
[10:29] ble so see God is sending
[10:33] him to this to a location
[10:37] amen and elishah said unto him as the
[10:41] Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I
[10:45] will not leave thee so they went down to
[10:50] ble and the sons of the Prophet where at
[10:53] ble came forth to elishah and said unto
[10:55] him knowest thou that the Lord will take
[10:58] away thy master
[11:00] from thy head
[11:02] today and he said yeah I know it hold ye
[11:05] your peace and Elijah said unto him said
[11:09] unto him Elisha tell I praise thee for
[11:13] the Lord had sent me to Jericho so the
[11:15] Lord had took him to a certain position
[11:19] and now he's done his the whatever he
[11:22] had to do there now he's taking him to
[11:24] another position he's moving his
[11:26] position now to
[11:28] Jericho and and he said as the Lord
[11:30] liveth and as I so liveth I will not
[11:33] leave
[11:34] thee so they came to
[11:37] Jericho and the sons of the prophets
[11:39] that were at Jericho came to Elijah and
[11:42] said unto him knowest thou that the Lord
[11:46] will take away thy master from thy head
[11:49] today and he answered yeah I know it all
[11:52] e your
[11:53] peace and Elijah said unto him Terry I
[11:56] pray thee year for the Lord had sent me
[11:59] to Jordan and and he said as the Lord
[12:03] liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not
[12:07] leave thee and they went
[12:14] on and 50 men of the sons of the Prophet
[12:17] went and stood to view a far off and
[12:20] they too stood by
[12:23] Jordan and Elijah took his mantle and
[12:25] wrapped it together and smoke the waters
[12:27] and they were divided either and tither
[12:30] so that they too went over on dry ground
[12:34] and it came to pass when they were gone
[12:36] over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask
[12:40] what I shall do for thee now remember
[12:44] this Supernatural things that are taking
[12:46] place here you're getting the the Jordan
[12:48] being open they're walking on dry ground
[12:50] and so forth but these things are
[12:52] happening in this Dimension but soon
[12:55] you're going to see another dimension is
[12:56] going to open up amen
[13:08] and it came to pass when they were gone
[13:09] over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask
[13:12] what I shall do for thee before I be
[13:14] taken away from thee and elishah said I
[13:16] pray thee let a double portion of thy
[13:18] Spirit be upon me and he said thou has
[13:22] as the heart thing never the L if thou
[13:24] see me when I am taken from thee it
[13:26] shall be unto thee it shall be so unto
[13:29] thee thee but if not it shall not be so
[13:32] and it came to pass as they still went
[13:34] on and talked that behold they appeared
[13:36] a chariot of fire and ERS of fire see so
[13:41] now remember as I said there were Jordan
[13:43] was parted happing the dimension but now
[13:46] another dimension is opened up amen and
[13:48] now now they're seeing this now that
[13:51] they appeared a charot of Fire coming
[13:55] from another dimension to this Dimension
[13:57] amen and horses of fire and parted them
[14:00] both asunder and Elijah went up by a
[14:04] whirlwind into
[14:05] heaven amen so this Dimension is open up
[14:10] now that Elisha even can see this amen
[14:12] that he's watching Elijah going up into
[14:14] a whirlwind amen so now when we thinking
[14:17] about growing up we're not talking about
[14:20] has we were learned when we were little
[14:22] little children that heaven is somewhere
[14:24] up in the sky we're talking about
[14:26] another dimension the prophet of God
[14:28] taught us that this is a another
[14:30] parallel Dimension
[14:32] amen amen you may be
[14:36] seated open also to the Book of
[14:39] Genesis 5 reading from verse 21 to
[14:45] 24 and Enoch lived 65
[14:50] years and begat
[14:53] metella and Enoch walked with God after
[14:56] he begat metella 300 years
[15:00] and begat sons and
[15:02] daughters and all of the days of Enoch
[15:04] with
[15:05] 36 and5 years and Enoch walked with God
[15:11] and he was not for God took
[15:15] him so we find
[15:18] that Enoch had to walk with God before
[15:22] God takes him amen the Bible not say
[15:25] speak about anything about Enoch dying
[15:27] or Enoch being buried doesn't tell you
[15:29] when he doesn't tell you which year all
[15:31] it says that Enoch walked with God and
[15:35] God took him he doesn't say what year it
[15:38] was or how many years he just says and
[15:40] Enoch walked with God so there was a
[15:43] time where Enoch had to have a speci
[15:45] specific walk he's not talking about a
[15:47] natural walk he not walking down the
[15:49] highway and he's walking with God he's
[15:51] talking about a specific
[15:53] walk in other words there to come a time
[15:56] where Enoch walk changed
[15:59] because Enoch was receiving
[16:00] communication From Another
[16:03] Dimension amen he was receiving
[16:05] communication of how he had to build
[16:08] this
[16:10] pyramid amen and how it had to be
[16:12] structured in the center of the
[16:17] earth he had to receive communication
[16:19] from from extraterrestrial
[16:22] beings from the supernatural amen amen
[16:26] and that is why even now scientist
[16:29] cannot fathom and cannot understand how
[16:31] this pyramid was
[16:33] built they cannot understand it with
[16:37] signs there was times when they thought
[16:39] it was a tomb but now they real they
[16:42] thought it was a tomb of one of the
[16:43] Pharaohs but now they realize that this
[16:46] place is empty because why it was made
[16:49] in such a way where Enoch had to climb
[16:52] up that seven step amen amen and Enoch
[16:55] was taken up amen yes amen
[16:59] he was translated from there he had to
[17:01] be changed from Mortal to immortality
[17:04] Hallelujah and therefore you couldn't
[17:06] find Enoch's body
[17:11] anyway so we speaking this morning on
[17:14] moving into position for
[17:17] translation and for the subtitle the
[17:20] bride walking in armony with the
[17:24] bridegroom amen we need to move in into
[17:29] position for
[17:32] translation amen we are put here on the
[17:35] earth for a purpose we are put to live
[17:38] out in this season to make a
[17:41] Rapture amen and this Rapture is a
[17:44] secret catching away if the good man of
[17:47] the house know what hour the thief
[17:50] cometh amen yes that scripture is for us
[17:56] it's not for the Rapture is a secret
[17:58] it's not for everybody
[18:01] amen that is why no one else can preach
[18:03] this Rapture message because they
[18:05] haven't received the
[18:07] message amen that come in this hour the
[18:11] message that come to give us the
[18:12] rapturing
[18:15] faith this message was designed to give
[18:18] you rapturing Faith this message was
[18:21] designed to change the Mortal to immort
[18:25] Immortal and this couldn't be done under
[18:27] the church ages
[18:29] we we crossed over from the seven Church
[18:31] age the lean Church into the bright age
[18:35] amen We've Come to an eternal age we
[18:38] can't be stuck this message couldn't be
[18:40] given to you in the church
[18:42] age if this was given to you in the
[18:44] church age you wouldn't receive the new
[18:46] birth because there wasn't atmosphere
[18:49] for the new birth in the lyan age but
[18:52] you had to come in the bright age and
[18:54] receive this new birth hallah hallelujah
[18:58] amen the atmosphere wasn't right there
[19:01] amen you had to come under the right
[19:03] atmosphere there had to be a cleaning up
[19:05] that's why you find the first group of
[19:07] ministers that received this message and
[19:09] you do a cleaning up because why when we
[19:12] came out of Egypt all the Deeds of Egypt
[19:15] all the ideas of Egypt which was let us
[19:17] here now all the things that will be
[19:19] taken away from
[19:20] us and that's why we have to come under
[19:22] the church order and
[19:25] Doctrine you see that is why Israel was
[19:28] different from Every Other Nation Israel
[19:30] wasn't a lawless
[19:32] Nation God given them a law God
[19:35] positioned them in tribes in drank and
[19:38] in file because God worked in order with
[19:41] Israel and he's given them the different
[19:43] laws and so forth that is why they
[19:45] became a peculiar nation and that is why
[19:48] out of the church age he comes now and
[19:51] he restores all things and he brings
[19:53] Church order and Doctrine that's why we
[19:56] don't come aitly into the house of God
[19:59] God's got a government amen he's got an
[20:02] Administration and he got things in
[20:04] order that is why you go to a
[20:06] denomination chur you find people
[20:08] talking people walking up and down
[20:10] people dressed up anyhow and they got no
[20:12] respect for the things of God because
[20:14] why this Bride is a peculiar
[20:17] people and he's got in rank and file
[20:21] amen he's got different
[20:24] Ministries he's got H in his church
[20:31] amen so we thought we were just in this
[20:35] world and we were just here but we
[20:38] didn't
[20:39] realize we might have been in our
[20:41] denominations we might be in the world
[20:44] system but within us we was designed in
[20:48] such a way that the gene of God was in
[20:51] US
[20:52] amen that God was going to give us a
[20:55] communication at a certain time and
[20:57] season in our life
[21:00] amen and how he was communicating with
[21:02] us when this word came our
[21:04] way amen it began now to trigger that
[21:07] signal you know it's like you know you
[21:11] get the special forces in the military
[21:14] if they have to go do a military
[21:16] operation in a certain country right
[21:19] they'll be dropped off at a certain
[21:21] place but for the extraction after the
[21:26] mission in order for them to be
[21:28] extracted from that country because they
[21:30] went there under a covert operation they
[21:32] went they undetected they did a mission
[21:36] they did a
[21:37] operation and at the end of the
[21:40] mission there's a certain points that
[21:43] they have to go to be
[21:46] extracted and they have to make that
[21:48] point their extraction can only take
[21:51] place at that point and they have to
[21:54] fight their way sometime they're going
[21:56] to go they remember they are Behind
[21:58] Enemy
[21:59] lines and the ground the the fights are
[22:03] the the the terrain is treacherous
[22:07] treacherous difficult to rain but they
[22:10] have to make their way to the extraction
[22:14] point if they don't meet the extraction
[22:16] point there won't be a pickup for them
[22:19] they can't be taken away back to their
[22:21] Homeland amen and we were put on the
[22:24] earth
[22:26] yeah Amen in the mid of Satan's
[22:30] Eden amen taking 6,000 years to Bull his
[22:33] Eden and he thought he got them he got
[22:36] the church ages he thought he he got
[22:38] them when he got him a ni Rome but God
[22:40] had a group of people there and then God
[22:43] put where they said that J shall live by
[22:45] faith then he sealed up a bunch of
[22:46] people then he had wle with
[22:48] sanctification then he had the
[22:49] Pentecostal age and then he thought he
[22:51] got the people naked and blind and
[22:53] miserable in his latest seean age when
[22:55] the Holy Ghost comes down when the word
[22:57] comes down and Christ was put out of the
[23:00] church but there was a bunch of people
[23:03] amen that was put here in the midst of
[23:05] Satan Eden covertly
[23:07] amen God has stor up for the season that
[23:11] we've got a mission on this Earth amen
[23:13] and our mission is to manifest Christ
[23:16] Our mission is to be one with him our
[23:19] mission is to be so much like him that
[23:21] we manifest his life upon the Earth our
[23:25] mission is to become Amen to take the
[23:27] title de book and to recognize that our
[23:29] inheritance has come back Amen to come
[23:32] as Sons and Daughters of God upon the
[23:34] Earth our mission is to come back to the
[23:36] God man amen to be amate Gods upon the
[23:39] Earth our mission is to have dominion
[23:41] over the Earth over sickness over every
[23:45] disease over every circumstance over
[23:47] every every onslaught of the enemy our
[23:50] mission is to express God on the
[23:54] earth amen but when our mission is over
[23:58] they must must come a point where we
[23:59] come to the extraction Point amen and
[24:02] how do we come with the extraction point
[24:04] we are now walking with God when we come
[24:07] and walk in harmony amen like how Jesus
[24:11] walked in harmony with the Father the
[24:13] bride must walk in harmony with him amen
[24:15] hallelujah amen the bride and the
[24:17] bridegroom must be in harmony amen when
[24:20] we in harmony we walk now like Enoch
[24:23] walked amen we walking into translation
[24:26] in this hour amen we are moving into
[24:29] translation we are moving to position
[24:31] and how do we move into position it's
[24:33] the holy ghost that positionally places
[24:35] us and now is the Holy Ghost
[24:37] positionally placing us through the
[24:39] preaching of the word amen he's placing
[24:42] us in our land of
[24:45] inheritance amen he's placing us into
[24:48] what we supposed to be in this
[24:51] hour amen there must be a Harmony
[24:54] between the bride and the bridegroom
[24:57] father May they be one even as we are
[25:02] one and this is that hour
[25:05] amen so you see we could never run away
[25:10] from God he designed Us in such a way he
[25:14] could in such a way that he had
[25:17] this Gene within us anytime any way he
[25:21] can contact us
[25:23] amen you can find yourself maybe going
[25:26] in the world going in a back condition
[25:28] but there'll come a time you can be in a
[25:31] bar you can be in the bar room you can
[25:34] be in the dance hall you can be amongst
[25:37] the world you can be alone in your
[25:39] bathroom but when he wants to contact
[25:41] you he will contact you because he not
[25:44] contacting the body he's contacting the
[25:47] soul amen God is not interested in the
[25:50] Heartwood God is interested in that part
[25:52] of him inside the Gene and he wants to
[25:54] conduct the gene amen
[25:58] and then you and and you didn't
[26:01] realize that you had this contact in you
[26:03] because you thought you just yeah living
[26:05] in this world but he sent the seven
[26:07] Thunders to come and awaken you to come
[26:10] and give you a true identity to come
[26:12] give you the revelation of who you
[26:15] originally were that you always wear a
[26:19] part of him that you come from
[26:22] eternity that you are Eternal being
[26:25] trapped in a temporary time zone
[26:28] amen why you didn't just know that when
[26:31] you were born because you're coming man
[26:33] the first birth you bypassed your
[26:35] theophany you bypass your word body amen
[26:40] amen and then you come under the old
[26:42] ademic
[26:45] nature but you are always where a part
[26:47] of him you come from eternity
[26:54] amen you
[26:56] know God cannot be complete without
[26:59] you God is only complete with you amen
[27:03] because you are the feminist part of God
[27:06] Amen that is why he's the head you are
[27:09] the body the body is the feminist part
[27:10] of God the bride is the feminist part of
[27:13] Christ which is part of his charact
[27:15] which is part of his attributes yes amen
[27:19] and that's why none of you can be lost
[27:21] when you get the revelation of that and
[27:24] you're connected with that then you
[27:26] realize that you can't be lost because
[27:28] he can't be complete without you amen
[27:32] but what happens is Satan tries to
[27:34] disconnect us from these Revelations and
[27:38] now he disconnected us when we don't
[27:40] stay with the
[27:41] word when we don't stay with the word
[27:44] we're not receiving the word in this
[27:46] hour and we are
[27:48] disconnected amen because God connects
[27:51] you through his
[27:52] word and his word must be a word of
[27:56] Revelation because revelation comes
[27:58] fresh and it stimulates you amen that is
[28:03] why in this hour we have received a good
[28:06] reports just like Joshua and Caleb when
[28:08] he went into the land they brought for
[28:10] the grapes and evidence what is that
[28:12] discipling the stimulation of Revelation
[28:15] oh we received a good report the
[28:17] evidence that this land is full of
[28:19] Revelation
[28:23] am
[28:26] amen so we from the time we come we've
[28:30] always been receiving this word amen
[28:33] we've receiving connection with God
[28:35] there was
[28:36] a we thought we can go anyhow but the
[28:40] guide is there to guide us the guide is
[28:44] there to show us the
[28:46] way that this is how you need to walk in
[28:49] the hour of
[28:51] translation this is how you need to be
[28:54] positioned for the translation and the
[28:57] guide that to move us into
[28:59] position amen and how is the holy ghost
[29:02] moving us into position through the
[29:04] preaching of the
[29:05] word amen is moving us into position for
[29:09] translation because there's nothing left
[29:11] for us on the Earth right now that is
[29:14] why we are in between the translation
[29:16] period and the time of
[29:19] manifesting as Sons and Daughters of God
[29:23] so this is the hour where Sons and
[29:25] Daughters of God are being manifested on
[29:26] the earth this is is the hour right now
[29:29] where we are to have dominion on the
[29:31] earth because after this hour is the
[29:34] resurrection and the translation am
[29:38] because first there must be a
[29:39] resurrection and then there will be a
[29:41] translation
[29:43] amen so before the resurrection takes
[29:47] place we are living in the hour where it
[29:49] must be in harmony between the bride and
[29:51] the bride Grom there must be a bride
[29:54] that will carry out the Mandate of a
[29:57] husband am
[29:59] amen we must carry out his mandate he
[30:01] said Greater Works than these they shall
[30:04] do the word must see the impact of the
[30:08] Gospel amen the the world must see these
[30:11] people have been with
[30:13] Jesus the people must say Jesus is with
[30:15] this
[30:17] people they must see say this the Jesus
[30:20] of the Bible the things that we heard of
[30:22] the Bible we can see it now being
[30:24] manifested among these people they might
[30:27] not understand understand the things you
[30:28] are saying they might not believe the
[30:31] things you are saying but they must be
[30:33] able to see the life amen that this
[30:36] gospel is producing a different life
[30:39] that you are not living like the people
[30:40] of the world Amen we are live we are
[30:44] being influenced From Another Dimension
[30:46] we are being influenced from another
[30:47] kingdom we are receiving communication
[30:50] for translation in this hour from
[30:52] another
[30:54] kingdom and that is why when the people
[30:56] are fting when the people are in
[30:58] depression you recognize those are demon
[31:01] spirits and you recognize when the
[31:03] people are in the world and the people
[31:04] are being influenced by sin you
[31:05] recognize his enticing Spirits their
[31:08] Spirit of Oppression the spirit of
[31:10] depression that is why people just speak
[31:13] negative things and people will just be
[31:16] sad but you have a hope you are working
[31:19] in perfection in this hour amen you are
[31:23] walking with a peace oh that surpasses
[31:26] all understanding because you know the
[31:27] the end
[31:28] results you know that you come from
[31:30] another world you know that you're going
[31:33] away from this misery from this world
[31:35] that is decaying and you're going to
[31:37] come back to a renovated
[31:41] Earth
[31:47] amen this is the
[31:51] hour you want to come to the stature of
[31:54] a perfect
[31:56] man and then only coming because the
[31:59] five4 mon is preaching to you not
[32:01] preaching any other word the word that's
[32:03] coming this
[32:05] day amen amen the word that come now to
[32:09] make you
[32:10] perfect to what to be in the image and
[32:14] likeness of
[32:17] God
[32:20] Amen that your brother and sister out
[32:22] there will come and say my dear brother
[32:27] God is with you
[32:33] I know that God be with you I have need
[32:36] of this and you're going to say my
[32:38] brother the things you have need of you
[32:40] have I give it to you in the name of
[32:43] Jesus
[32:44] Christ
[32:45] amen they going to recognize God is with
[32:48] you they going to recognize your
[32:51] communication because why when you are a
[32:54] spiritual person your communication is
[32:56] not like everybody else
[32:59] when you are I tell you it's it's easy
[33:01] to see a person that's full of the Holy
[33:02] Ghost and not the one that's not full of
[33:05] the Holy Ghost is negative about
[33:06] everything in life a person that's not
[33:09] full of the Holy Ghost is
[33:11] fearful a person that's not full of the
[33:13] Holy
[33:14] Ghost and doesn't have confidence in
[33:17] himself they they lack
[33:21] self-confidence they always feel that
[33:23] that they
[33:25] inferior but when you have the Holy
[33:28] Ghost you have confidence because you
[33:31] know who you
[33:32] are you know what the word says about
[33:35] you you know that you are a super Church
[33:39] you know that you are a super race you
[33:41] know that you are an invincible
[33:43] Army you know in the hour when hell is
[33:46] Unleashed upon the Earth Heaven has come
[33:49] down to unite with you
[33:51] amen you know that you are seated in
[33:54] Heavenly places amen that is why you
[33:57] don't talk L language you talk Heavenly
[34:00] language
[34:02] amen and this is hour where you have
[34:05] discernment amen you are able to discern
[34:08] the spirits around you you can't be
[34:11] walking in into position for translation
[34:14] and not discern the
[34:16] spirits L because the biggest demon the
[34:19] biggest
[34:20] demons are where not in the person
[34:23] that's oppressed like when Jesus was
[34:25] casting out that Legion from that man
[34:28] and it went into the pigs not that
[34:31] Spirits the biggest Spirit are your
[34:33] religious
[34:35] Spirits the biggest demons are the
[34:38] religious
[34:40] demons that's the hardest demon to deal
[34:44] with didn't the prophet of God say that
[34:46] when he's speaking demonology the arest
[34:49] demons to deal with are those religious
[34:51] Spirits that's keeping people from the
[34:53] true word of
[34:55] God that's keeping the people from the
[34:57] TR in the hour yes keeping people
[35:00] denominated around a certain Doctrine
[35:02] that's right that don't want them to
[35:04] walk with the guide in the hour because
[35:06] the guide is getting you ready for
[35:10] translation the guide is getting you
[35:12] ready to leave the
[35:13] Earth well they want to be
[35:16] Earthbound they want to build the
[35:18] kingdoms on the earth on temporal things
[35:22] you know when the prophet's Ministry was
[35:24] different from other Ministries at the
[35:26] time yes you you know when when all
[35:30] Roberts was
[35:32] preaching and the prophet was preaching
[35:34] he said I didn't I don't have the faith
[35:35] like AO Roberts it doesn't mean he got
[35:38] little Fai what he meant was UT Robert
[35:41] you tell the people touch the television
[35:43] or touch the
[35:44] radio and receive your
[35:46] healing the prophet of God w't do that
[35:49] because he W take signs to mix with god
[35:52] with is Supernatural amen he based his
[35:55] faith on the word of godah amen he own
[35:58] you signs amen and mixes mix the mix
[36:02] Faith with
[36:03] signs he takes faith and mix it with the
[36:06] word
[36:09] amen so we find this bride as well her
[36:12] faith is
[36:13] mixed with the word of God and nothing
[36:16] else you won't compromise with the word
[36:18] of God
[36:19] Amen even if there comes a time where
[36:22] she have to give up everything she won't
[36:25] compromise with this word
[36:27] she would lose everything else but stay
[36:30] with his
[36:35] word so you find that you walking around
[36:39] this hour with discernment recognizing
[36:40] their Spirits when you're talking to
[36:43] human
[36:44] beings you recognize that you are
[36:46] different from all the other human
[36:48] beings you're not the same like them
[36:51] amen you can't be the same like
[36:54] them because
[36:56] why your your life is different to
[36:59] them you come with two Natures in one
[37:02] body amen the rest of the people didn't
[37:05] come like
[37:06] that you come with a gene of God that
[37:09] you can be quickened when the Holy Ghost
[37:11] was revealed is released Amen on the day
[37:15] when the Holy Ghost was released to you
[37:17] you had the gene of
[37:18] God they don't have that that is why you
[37:22] find that only those that die sleep in
[37:26] the faith
[37:28] in their faith they receive the message
[37:30] of the hour they go to a young body on
[37:32] the other side they only have a theop
[37:35] body the other people go as Souls under
[37:38] the altar if they were saved but without
[37:40] the Holy
[37:42] Ghost only those and they own be in the
[37:45] same young body they will go to whatever
[37:47] they was in because right now on the
[37:51] other side only those with the theop is
[37:55] in the sixth dimension
[37:57] only those that died believing this
[37:59] message amen those that died in the
[38:02] faith the rest of the Saints rest of the
[38:04] Dead raised up after a thousand years so
[38:07] down the altar
[38:10] amen but on the resurrection it's only
[38:13] that die those that died in the faith
[38:16] amen will come up in the resurrection
[38:18] with young bodies again because why they
[38:21] had a theop there their theop will come
[38:23] pick up this Earthly body become a
[38:25] glorified body and that's the hour We're
[38:28] living right
[38:30] now so when people don't have are not
[38:33] connected with his word is because they
[38:35] don't have contact up there yes you have
[38:38] to have a contact from that Dimension
[38:40] amen something that you bypassed amen
[38:44] you have to hear from your from another
[38:47] source you have to have a connection
[38:50] amen so we find in the people are so
[38:53] disconnected because Satan is bringing
[38:56] things that will disconnect you yes
[39:00] amen it's like when you got
[39:03] good uh internet a good
[39:07] Wi-Fi and then suddenly something
[39:09] disrupts the connection it affects
[39:11] everything yes yes so Satan wants to
[39:14] disrupt the connection yes that God is
[39:17] given his hour
[39:22] amen and how does he do that he brings
[39:24] doubt
[39:30] he bring the cares of his
[39:33] life you know
[39:35] when when when Pharaoh wanted to keep
[39:39] the children of Israel from worshiping
[39:41] God what did he
[39:44] do he made the task
[39:46] Masters give them more
[39:49] work amen he made it harder for them to
[39:51] make those the the the clay and the the
[39:56] he took away the straw from them
[39:58] amen and he made life difficult for them
[40:01] that they'll toil all day they'll toil
[40:04] till they go home and just enough to
[40:06] sleep yes they don't have time to do
[40:09] anything they don't have time to even
[40:11] think about
[40:12] God but what he didn't realize that that
[40:15] will make them to cry out to
[40:18] God and when they began to cry to God
[40:21] the Bible says God remembered the
[40:23] Covenants
[40:27] that's what happen when a child of God
[40:29] cries out to him you w forget who he
[40:32] promised to you amen and we have an
[40:34] unconditional
[40:39] covenants so we find that Satan is
[40:41] trying to keep the people busy he tring
[40:44] to keep you busy with the cares of life
[40:47] he tring to keep you busy with all
[40:48] Earthly things with temporal things that
[40:52] you don't have time to worship God you
[40:54] don't have time for the things of God
[40:56] not that you don't want to have the
[40:59] time but you got to recognize that and
[41:02] is Unleashed on the
[41:04] earth and the devil has
[41:07] advanced the devil is not going to come
[41:09] like how he come those many years ago
[41:11] and just possess the people possess the
[41:13] people no now he coming
[41:15] interception he's going to make you come
[41:18] and be influenced by the things around
[41:21] you he going to make you be influenced
[41:23] with the Ral
[41:24] strength he's going to make you be
[41:27] influenced With the Jones it's going to
[41:29] make you be influenced in your workplace
[41:32] to achieve for better a better career a
[41:35] better position and when you take higher
[41:37] position there's more responsibility and
[41:39] when there's more responsibility taking
[41:41] up more of your time and when more of
[41:43] your time is taken up then you have
[41:45] lesser time for God you have lesser time
[41:48] for the things of God but remember this
[41:50] is not living 10 years ago or 20 years
[41:53] ago this is the hour where you are
[41:56] moving to position position for
[41:58] translation this is the hour where it's
[42:00] at your doorstep right now amen this is
[42:04] the hour where this must be such an
[42:05] Harmony between the bride and the
[42:09] bridegroom and this is the hour where
[42:11] the 54 is crying out to keep you
[42:13] connected amen amen because the devil
[42:16] wants to keep you disconnected but the
[42:18] Holy Ghost wants to keep you
[42:21] connected
[42:23] amen so we want to stay connected amen
[42:33] we can see the darkness on the land
[42:36] amen we can see
[42:41] sin being
[42:43] glorified yes amen the things of God are
[42:47] not exalted anymore sin is being
[42:49] glorified yes you'll find
[42:53] that in the the best most prestigious
[42:56] universe verities around the world such
[42:58] as harvest Harvard and so
[43:01] forth sin is being
[43:05] glorified that's right in the most
[43:08] prestigious universities yes
[43:11] amen
[43:13] and there's a say there's a saying that
[43:15] going in
[43:16] universities that you don't have to
[43:19] understand certain things but you just
[43:22] need to have solidarity with certain
[43:24] things
[43:27] without even understanding that's
[43:30] ignorance so you can just be ignorant
[43:32] and just have solidarity with something
[43:34] that's wrong would that something that's
[43:36] against God with something that's
[43:38] ungodly with something that's going
[43:40] against everything that God is showing
[43:41] in the
[43:44] word we are not of the world we are in
[43:47] this world but not of this world we got
[43:50] to be in harmony with the bridegroom We
[43:53] Are From Another World our intelligence
[43:56] is from another world
[43:58] we don't take the intelligence of this
[44:00] civilization because this civilization
[44:03] is being influenced with demon
[44:05] powers this is Satan's evil
[44:09] age and he works through the education
[44:13] system that is why we never knew that we
[44:15] were small we just thought that to get a
[44:17] good job you must work you must study
[44:19] and you get a good job all of us
[44:21] teaching you to be a
[44:23] slave they wanted you to be a slave
[44:25] because they're teaching you to get a
[44:26] better education for a better career and
[44:29] you become a professional when you
[44:30] become a professional you're actually a
[44:32] slave because all you're going to do is
[44:33] work work
[44:35] work that why the Jew the Jews were
[44:37] thought different the Jews said no we
[44:40] must have our own
[44:41] businesses we take a bus we can't work
[44:43] for and be a slave all we work for a
[44:45] certain time but then we become our own
[44:48] Master their mentality was different
[44:51] because they were taught differently and
[44:53] that's why they became so successful
[44:54] around the world but we were taught to
[44:57] be
[44:57] Slaves by our education system which is
[45:01] orchestrated by Satan
[45:04] amen and you find that the most
[45:06] intelligent people on the Earth or
[45:09] so-called intelligent people are the
[45:11] most ignorant people on the Earth amen
[45:13] because they can't understand simple
[45:16] things I me you're getting the most
[45:18] intelligent mind who can't believe
[45:21] there's a God who believes that you Evol
[45:23] from an ape and you call him the most
[45:25] intelligent mind
[45:28] that's how they
[45:31] think so you
[45:34] see without the Holy Ghost you're not on
[45:36] a gravitational
[45:37] level you cannot walk in hour of
[45:40] translation without the guide without
[45:42] having the Holy Ghost in This Hour
[45:45] because without the Holy Ghost you know
[45:48] I mean I'm sure many of you remember the
[45:50] days when you didn't have the Holy
[45:52] Ghost I remember the days when I wasn't
[45:55] born again
[45:57] I never had the baptism of the Holy
[45:58] Ghost the most miserable times of your
[46:00] life because without the Holy Ghost your
[46:02] life is terrible you you have fear you
[46:06] have anxiety you have depression you
[46:09] have
[46:12] doubt but with the Holy Ghost your life
[46:14] is so
[46:15] peaceful you're not stress you do not
[46:18] walk in
[46:19] fear amen you walk in
[46:24] confidence because the Holy Ghost keeps
[46:26] you on a gravitation
[46:28] level so do you realize that in this
[46:31] hour outside of the message of the hour
[46:34] that people have come no one else has
[46:36] the Holy
[46:37] Ghost the only other people that will
[46:39] receive the Holy Ghost is when you leave
[46:41] the Earth the gospel goes to the Jews
[46:44] it's the 144,000 Jews that will receive
[46:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost nobody
[46:50] else will receive the Holy
[46:52] Ghost and right now you're the only
[46:55] bunch of people on the Earth that's
[46:57] working with the Holy Ghost
[46:59] amen there was a time the Bible said the
[47:03] GI for on the just and the
[47:05] unjust amen the workings of the of the
[47:08] Holy Ghost was among the
[47:10] Pentecostals but now the sh the life has
[47:13] completely left it because it must come
[47:15] back to the
[47:16] grain amen there's no life there anymore
[47:19] and they substituted it now for what for
[47:22] entertainment just to keep the people in
[47:25] by entertainment
[47:29] amen because why like Elijah when is
[47:32] walking to battle he saw the sons of the
[47:33] Prophet all those small prophets after
[47:35] the great prophet and what happened they
[47:38] all had their own interpretation yes
[47:41] there were a lot of them there in
[47:43] ble but Elijah was typing us at that
[47:46] time the translate those are going to be
[47:48] translated because remember there's
[47:50] going to be us there going to be some of
[47:52] us who won't see death in the
[47:54] hour there's going to be a group of
[47:57] people that will not see de amen there
[48:00] will be a group of people who's ready
[48:02] now amen who's moving to position for
[48:04] translation in this hour they are going
[48:07] to change Dimensions amen amen and those
[48:10] that
[48:11] slept we shall not prevent them which to
[48:13] sleep because they're going to come
[48:16] here amen the sixth Dimension must empty
[48:18] them out because we're not going to have
[48:20] to dimensional CH without them amen
[48:23] we're going to go as one body amen amen
[48:26] we're going to go into the change
[48:28] Dimensions
[48:31] amen I'm telling you something brothers
[48:33] and sisters do not wait to start
[48:35] receiving faith when you see the
[48:37] resurrection taking place faith is
[48:39] coming now to the preaching of the word
[48:42] you are receiving communication From
[48:44] Another Dimension through the words amen
[48:48] and you're not going to be receiving it
[48:49] staying on your own staying at home
[48:51] you're going to receive it through the
[48:53] 54 Ministry you're going to receive it
[48:55] to the in the present hour with the gift
[48:57] that God has given to the church amen
[48:59] that's how you're receiving
[49:00] communication to give you faith for the
[49:02] change in this hour Hallelujah and that
[49:05] is why when you find when they coming
[49:07] when the resurrection takes place it is
[49:09] typed in the Bible in Jesus time when
[49:12] you come and say Jesus went and appeared
[49:14] disappeared and many and they went the
[49:17] the Believers that rose from the dead
[49:18] after the
[49:20] resurrection they went to Jerusalem to
[49:23] the
[49:24] Believers and what is Jerusalem type
[49:26] tying us amen we are typing Jerusalem
[49:30] the city amen the bride of Christ they
[49:33] won't appear to the other relatives who
[49:37] are not in the word they will not appear
[49:40] to the relatives who are not in the
[49:43] message who are not baptized with the
[49:45] Holy Ghost they only appear to the
[49:49] bride so the resurrection is for when
[49:51] the resurrection takes place those
[49:53] Believers that are gone beyond the cut
[49:56] of of time when the sixth Dimension
[49:58] empty is out they will come and appear
[50:01] only to
[50:03] Believers and when Believers are telling
[50:05] other people they're not going to
[50:06] believe you you not you won't have time
[50:08] to tell other people that's a very
[50:10] serious
[50:11] hour because you are going to
[50:12] glorification in that
[50:14] hour you are no time for mixing up with
[50:17] other social Affairs at that
[50:19] time it's a very serious
[50:22] hour and God works in
[50:25] order amen
[50:27] so when they come in here we are getting
[50:29] ready to go with them we got our social
[50:33] life is over on the earth at that time
[50:36] we're not interested in those
[50:40] things because when we are living the
[50:43] Earth gospel must go back to the Jews
[50:45] Moses and Elijah must come down Satan
[50:48] must come incarnated into the
[50:50] pope you see the hour we're living in
[50:57] that's why we find it even in the Old
[50:59] Testament when they Rose the Bible says
[51:02] they appeared to many in the city in
[51:04] Jerusalem
[51:06] yes Jerusalem is typing the
[51:10] brides amen they never go to people out
[51:13] out of Jerusalem they never go to people
[51:16] out of the
[51:17] city that is why there has to be a
[51:20] meeting
[51:21] point and where we are meeting in the
[51:23] homeland of the Holy
[51:25] Ghost we come in the in the message of
[51:28] the hour we we are meeting in the word
[51:31] amen
[51:33] amen because we all attracted to this
[51:36] one
[51:37] word which is the bridegroom hallelujah
[51:40] amen and there must be such a sweet
[51:43] harmony between the bride and the
[51:46] bridegroom amen she doesn't argue with
[51:49] his words she doesn't fight with the
[51:52] word what did Israel do when they were
[51:55] taken out of Egypt
[51:58] they wasn't they were a few miles away
[52:01] to go into the
[52:03] Homeland but by the grumbling by the
[52:06] moanings by the groaning it took them 40
[52:09] Years Around The
[52:11] Wilderness and there's been a time where
[52:13] there was a groanings and grumblings and
[52:17] doctrinal
[52:18] disputes but now is a time not to have
[52:21] church politics or message politics now
[52:24] is the time to come into harmony now is
[52:27] the time to come into Oneness with him
[52:29] now is the time to recognize your
[52:31] position and your Authority now is the
[52:33] time to recognize the title deed has
[52:35] come down amen that everything that Adam
[52:38] lost you gain
[52:40] amen yes you come by the first births
[52:44] just like
[52:46] Adam you your first birth was under the
[52:49] first Adam the nature the laws of sin
[52:52] and everything is
[52:55] there but in Jesus Christ
[52:58] come amen and made a way for you through
[53:01] the new births you are delivered from
[53:04] every sin of the first Birth by the new
[53:07] birth your old birth is crept away you
[53:10] just crept in his
[53:12] body but your nature Has
[53:15] Changed by the new birth you are a new
[53:19] species you are a new
[53:21] civilization you're not influenced
[53:23] anymore by scientific civilization you
[53:26] are inuenced by fi civilization
[53:28] hallelujah amen you are a new birth amen
[53:31] and your new birth done away with the
[53:34] own nature if be done away with all
[53:36] nature all the sin all the attributes
[53:39] that brings the curse you are done
[53:42] that's done away with amen that is why
[53:45] every Redemptive blessing Belongs to
[53:50] You amen you know science is trying to
[53:54] now modify the gene for example
[53:57] if you have a family of diabetes they
[53:59] can modify the gene so they don't affect
[54:01] you you have a family with erit line of
[54:05] uh maybe art problems and they can
[54:08] modify the genes they don't affect you
[54:11] trying to scien is trying to do that but
[54:13] yours is already been modified by having
[54:16] the new
[54:17] birs that genetic lines can't affect you
[54:20] what your ancestors did can't affect you
[54:23] those curses are not upon you yes you
[54:26] all came under the curse because of what
[54:28] happened in the E because of your mother
[54:30] Eve in the Garden of Eden but under the
[54:33] new birth under Jesus Christ The Curse
[54:35] is
[54:39] gone

[54:46] Lamb's wife that is walking this hour
[54:48] nothing can move her amen nothing can
[54:50] take off call that's why he cried out he
[54:53] said stay in line stay in line
[54:58] amen she has to stay in line with the
[55:00] word she has to be connected to the
[55:03] guide because the guide is guiding her
[55:05] through that is why the children of
[55:07] Israel when were leaving they had to
[55:09] have the guide although Moses was there
[55:12] taking wasn't Moses said I will send my
[55:15] angel before you amen they had to have
[55:17] the guide to take them because they was
[55:19] going into place where they never been
[55:22] before those were going on a journey
[55:25] they wasn't going before and that is why
[55:26] the guide is leading us to this journey
[55:28] that we haven't been before amen that is
[55:32] why the the word is being opened up to
[55:34] us now in his hour it's not us that's
[55:37] bringing his word it's the guy that's
[55:38] bringing his
[55:42] words

[56:27] we are Eternal
[56:29] beings you are receiving communication
[56:31] that you are a god

[56:40] close Union that's what the GU is doing

[56:53] us is our friends out there
[56:58] is our family is our work is how much we
[57:03] can achieve if that's the world that
[57:04] exist to us then there's something wrong
[57:07] with our walk in this hour and that's
[57:09] not the walk that's moving into
[57:11] translation in his
[57:12] hour amen if that's the world that
[57:15] exists to you that only what I'm how
[57:18] much money I'm going to make

[57:24] latest stories I'm going to tell what
[57:26] happened over the weekend if that's the
[57:28] only world that exists to you then
[57:31] there's something wrong about your walk

[57:33] hour that is not the Enoch
[57:36] walk that's not the walk that will move
[57:38] you in
[57:39] Translation because there must be
[57:41] another world that exists to you that
[57:43] while you are seated here you can see
[57:46] the other
[57:47] worlds amen I'm not talking about

[58:21] out this PID City from within you amen
[58:25] each one one of us must push out the
[58:27] pyramid from within
[58:28] us amen we must come to the stature of a
[58:33] perfect
[58:39] man so you find Elijah when he's walking
[58:42] now he knows that he must be taken up
[58:45] and God is Mo speaking to him
[58:46] communicating with him telling him what
[58:49] position he must be then from there he
[58:52] receives more communication you need to
[58:53] leave here and move to another position
[58:56] then from that position he receives more
[58:59] information you need to move to another
[59:01] position that's what we're doing right
[59:03] now week after week as the word is
[59:06] preached to us you are in this position
[59:08] right you have now moved you have now

[59:32] where the eagle saw higher than the
[59:34] other birds around you amen
[59:38] am and as you moving into position you
[59:42] find that your spiritual growth you have
[59:44] a better understanding of the word you

[59:57] unto us the Holy Ghost is shining light
[1:00:00] unto his word amen showing

[1:00:06] this Eternal City amen we are that City
[1:00:10] the bride makes up the
[1:00:12] city am
[1:00:27] read this
[1:00:29] quotes open to the message
[1:00:38] uh uh a guide paragraph
[1:00:45] 49 when Israel left Egypt for the
[1:00:48] promised land in Exodus
[1:00:50] 13:21 God know that they had never
[1:00:54] traveled that way before
[1:00:56] it was only 40 miles but yet they needed
[1:01:00] something to go with him they lose their
[1:01:03] way so he God send them a
[1:01:07] guide Exodus
[1:01:09] 1321 something like this I I send my
[1:01:12] angel before you the pullow of fire to
[1:01:14] keep you in the way to guide them to his
[1:01:16] promised land and the children of Israel
[1:01:18] followed that guide the pull of Fire by
[1:01:22] Night A Cloud by day when it stopped
[1:01:25] they stopped when he journeyed they
[1:01:28] journeyed and when he got them close to
[1:01:31] the
[1:01:31] land and they wasn't foot to go over he
[1:01:35] led them back into the Wilderness again
[1:01:37] he wouldn't go with them that's what it
[1:01:40] is the church today no doubt but what
[1:01:44] the longsuffering of God today like it
[1:01:46] was in the days of Noah the church would
[1:01:50] done been gone if it had just corrected
[1:01:53] and set in order
[1:01:56] but he has to lead us around and around
[1:01:58] and around little did Israel know when
[1:02:02] they were shouting on seeing dead
[1:02:04] soldiers of Egypt the drowned
[1:02:08] ERS Pharaoh's chariots turned up upside
[1:02:13] down they got their Victory Moses in the
[1:02:16] spirit singing in the spirit Miriam
[1:02:19] dancing in the spirit and the daughters
[1:02:22] of Israel running up and down the bank
[1:02:23] shouting and dancing they only a few
[1:02:27] days from milk and
[1:02:29] honey little do they know it was 40
[1:02:31] years because they begin to Grumble
[1:02:34] against God and the guide amen now the
[1:02:38] guide speaks to the fivefold
[1:02:41] ministry the Holy Ghost speaks through
[1:02:43] the word I mean the word comes which is
[1:02:46] the Holy Ghost comes through the five4
[1:02:50] ministry so it is grumbling and moaning
[1:02:53] how you expect to see this things but
[1:02:55] but when there's a Harmony you begin to
[1:02:58] realize it's just a parallel
[1:03:00] Dimension it's just another dimension
[1:03:03] and you've been changing from the inside
[1:03:05] out yes there's a change taking place
[1:03:08] you're pushing out your pyramid from the
[1:03:10] from this Earth you're pushing out a
[1:03:13] pyramid that you're going to be ready
[1:03:15] now and you take that step like seven
[1:03:17] step like Enoch and he was translated
[1:03:20] you taken
[1:03:21] away amen so right
[1:03:24] now you when you come in such a Harmony
[1:03:26] you begin to see this is just here I'm
[1:03:30] so connected that is why you find
[1:03:32] sometimes you feeling the presence of
[1:03:34] God just taken away because why you're
[1:03:37] bumping into the dimension amen you're
[1:03:40] bumping into
[1:03:41] Angels amen and you feel good in the
[1:03:44] presence of God sometime even while
[1:03:46] you're worshiping you feel good because
[1:03:47] you're bumping into Angels amen
[1:03:56] paragraph
[1:03:58] 56 God told them that he would send them
[1:04:02] a guide he would lead them in the way
[1:04:05] and as long as they followed that P of
[1:04:07] fire they was all right he led them up
[1:04:11] to the promised land gate and that was
[1:04:14] as far as he would go he was to go then
[1:04:17] Joshua that great warrior remember the
[1:04:20] day that he told them sanctify yourself
[1:04:23] the third day God going to open up
[1:04:26] Jordan here and we're going across now
[1:04:31] watch what he said in the scripture he
[1:04:34] said stay close behind the
[1:04:37] HK for you not passed this way
[1:04:41] before amen the ark is the
[1:04:46] word so what was the
[1:04:49] ark
[1:04:53] amen the word don't travel your
[1:04:57] denominational Roots now stay right
[1:05:00] behind the
[1:05:01] words so if you want to have this body
[1:05:04] this translation work you've got to stay
[1:05:07] behind the words
[1:05:10] amen don't travel your denominational
[1:05:13] Roots now stay right behind the word cuz
[1:05:17] you hav passed this way before you see
[1:05:20] that is why when you're walking in this
[1:05:22] translation walk in this hour you're not
[1:05:24] coming to your denomination ways of what
[1:05:26] you thought the Rapture is
[1:05:29] about they thought that the Rapture is
[1:05:32] about God is coming and everyone seeing
[1:05:35] him in the sky no this is a secret
[1:05:37] catching away it's not for everybody and
[1:05:41] it's not as you think Heaven is up in
[1:05:43] the sky it's a dimension it took a
[1:05:45] prophet to go beyond the curtain of time
[1:05:47] come to give us back that report amen
[1:05:50] one who went and testified of the
[1:05:54] land you have to come this way amen not
[1:05:59] the way you were thought or not the way
[1:06:02] it was put in pictures and all the
[1:06:03] things that you're growing up in in your
[1:06:07] you know the artist impression of it and
[1:06:08] things like of heaven and so forth
[1:06:12] Heaven is not like that amen it's
[1:06:14] another dimension yes but it's a real ex
[1:06:19] Dimension Prophet said it's not people
[1:06:22] playing hops in the
[1:06:23] cloud it's not just we have real bodies
[1:06:26] there amen it's a real
[1:06:31] place he
[1:06:36] said stay behind the word cuz you
[1:06:38] haven't passed this way before and
[1:06:39] brother if there ever was a time that
[1:06:42] the Christian ought to examine itself
[1:06:44] it's right
[1:06:45] now so you see they don't realize that
[1:06:49] the Rapture cycle already started with a
[1:06:51] shout a short a voice there must be a
[1:06:54] resurrection and then the Trump of God
[1:06:57] then the then the
[1:06:59] Quicken and those that are raised from
[1:07:01] the dead and us who are alive and remain
[1:07:03] will be changed and transformed we will
[1:07:06] go with them amen they don't realize the
[1:07:08] process of the Rapture because it's a
[1:07:11] secret am it's not a public show amen
[1:07:15] the seven seal wasn't a public show yes
[1:07:17] the seven seal got to do it is coming
[1:07:19] but it's a secret amen it's only
[1:07:22] revealed to us amen
[1:07:24] [Music]

[1:09:31] births and now we' come in the promised

[1:10:04] as being restored to Adam amen this a
[1:10:08] bride Adam
[1:10:11] amen back to Dominion again back to
[1:10:14] sunship again
[1:10:18] amen second Peter 1 1:2 says knowing
[1:10:24] this first that no Prophecy of the
[1:10:26] scripture is of any private
[1:10:28] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[1:10:31] in Old Time by the will of man but only
[1:10:36] men of God spake as they were moved by
[1:10:40] the holy ghost that is still the same
[1:10:42] today amen men of God are moved when
[1:10:46] they are moved I mean speak when they
[1:10:48] are moved by the Holy Ghost we don't
[1:10:51] want theology amen we don't want
[1:10:53] man-made teachings but we want to be
[1:10:55] moved we want to speak as we are moved
[1:10:58] by the Holy
[1:11:01] Ghost
[1:11:05] Amen in the message how can I overcome
[1:11:07] he says we see this age that we're
[1:11:10] living in is one of the grandest of all
[1:11:12] ages of all ages the L here in church
[1:11:15] age is the grandest of all the church
[1:11:16] ages because it's the ending of time and
[1:11:19] the blending of
[1:11:21] Eternity amen that's why he taking us
[1:11:23] out of the church into the bright age
[1:11:26] amen because from the L and church age
[1:11:28] we come out yes and we go into the
[1:11:32] bright which is blending of
[1:11:35] Eternity it's the ending of time and the
[1:11:38] blending of Eternity and then it's the
[1:11:40] greatest sinful
[1:11:43] age it's more sin in this age that's
[1:11:46] ever been because this is the hour when
[1:11:49] the fourth of Rider is riding and then
[1:11:52] the N is following him
[1:11:59] and the powers of Satan is many times
[1:12:01] harder to fight against that it was in
[1:12:04] any
[1:12:05] age yeah back there in early ages a
[1:12:09] Christian could for his profession of
[1:12:11] being a church of belonging to Christ
[1:12:13] could be beheaded for it he could be
[1:12:15] killed and put out of his misery and go
[1:12:17] to God quickly but now the enemy has
[1:12:21] coming in the name of the
[1:12:23] church and it's so
[1:12:26] deceiving this is the great age of
[1:12:30] deception when Christ said so the true
[1:12:33] spirits will be so close in the last
[1:12:35] days till it will receive the very
[1:12:37] elected if it were possible remember
[1:12:41] Christ spoke of an elected people for
[1:12:42] the last day it would receive the very
[1:12:45] elected if it were possible so close the
[1:12:48] people so live people can live a clean
[1:12:51] holy life people can believe this
[1:12:54] message
[1:12:55] in terms of when I say believe the
[1:12:57] message I mean come in the uh the
[1:13:01] message and have the church order and
[1:13:04] Doctrine in other words they can live
[1:13:06] clean
[1:13:07] lives they can live holy
[1:13:10] lives they can dress
[1:13:13] ight and they can go to a messy church
[1:13:16] but not be
[1:13:18] connected not be connected with the
[1:13:21] guide and if you're not connected with
[1:13:22] the guide how are you going to be
[1:13:24] translated in to people can be in
[1:13:27] serving in the message for so many years
[1:13:29] but the message is not in them the
[1:13:31] message is the Holy Ghost the messenger
[1:13:34] of the hate is the Holy Ghost amen they
[1:13:38] haven't become one with the word there's
[1:13:40] no Harmony between them and Christ you
[1:13:43] talk to them all they know of the
[1:13:45] message is a long ha and a long dress
[1:13:47] and going to a certain church but they
[1:13:49] don't know nothing about how the word is
[1:13:51] changing how the word is now progressing
[1:13:54] amen the word is becoming more clearer
[1:13:57] and now the word is transforming you
[1:13:58] amen and getting you ready for
[1:14:03] translation amen they can live above
[1:14:05] that and still not with
[1:14:07] it amen didn't didn't the Bible say
[1:14:10] there be foolish virgins as well those
[1:14:13] that didn't receive the Holy Ghost they
[1:14:16] didn't want they didn't want to be
[1:14:17] stimulated by Revelation amen they
[1:14:19] didn't have they was happy with the Des
[1:14:21] the wine they had they didn't want new
[1:14:23] wine they want more wine to to fill
[1:14:27] bottles up with
[1:14:29] wine the Holy Ghost in Noah's time time
[1:14:32] of today Jesus referred to it and said
[1:14:34] as it was in Noah's time so shall it be
[1:14:37] in the coming of the son of man in
[1:14:38] Noah's time so shall it be in the coming
[1:14:40] of the son of man notice they were they
[1:14:43] were all that anti anti-an World perhaps
[1:14:46] of millions of people they were eight
[1:14:48] Overcomers eight people overcome that
[1:14:51] was real genuine Overcomers there was
[1:14:54] Noah
[1:14:55] three sons and and their wives no one
[1:14:58] and his wife eight overcome they entered
[1:15:01] the Ark at the appropriate time how did
[1:15:03] they do it they listen to the word of
[1:15:06] God they were caught outside the door
[1:15:08] they sorry they wasn't caught outside
[1:15:11] the door they were caught inside the
[1:15:12] door oh my beloved friends don't let
[1:15:16] that door shut Jesus said as it was in
[1:15:19] the days in that day so shall it be in
[1:15:21] the coming of the son of man so shall it
[1:15:23] be in the coming of the son man now
[1:15:26] there's somebody is going to get caught
[1:15:28] outside that door many of them might
[1:15:31] have had good intentions and someday if
[1:15:34] such things happen we'll go in with
[1:15:37] brother Noah cuz he's a fine fellow but
[1:15:40] you see it caught just 8 in five now
[1:15:43] think hard now if you are laying around
[1:15:46] getting dirty get in hurry quick cuz the
[1:15:49] door might close at any
[1:15:51] time and there's always been an ark in
[1:15:53] God's economy
[1:15:55] there was an ark in the days of Noah for
[1:15:57] the saving of his people there was an
[1:15:59] ark in the days of the law Ark of
[1:16:00] testimony in the days of the law they
[1:16:02] followed the ark and there is a third
[1:16:05] dispensation now like Noah's time lot's
[1:16:08] time and now this time there is an ark
[1:16:11] now and that Ark is not a denomination
[1:16:13] neither it is it a good works that you
[1:16:17] do it is by one Spirit Romans 8:1 we all
[1:16:21] baptized into one body in the domain of
[1:16:24] the the kingdom there's one spiritual
[1:16:27] baptism no matter how good how bad
[1:16:30] whatever you in the Kingdom buy a holy
[1:16:33] ghost baptism that's the only way you
[1:16:35] overcome it's all that is under the shed
[1:16:38] blood is Overcomers because you cannot
[1:16:40] overcome yourself it's he that overcome

[1:17:26] while we are yet live and remain we
[1:17:27] shall be changed
[1:17:29] amen but right now we are moving into
[1:17:32] position for translation through the
[1:17:33] preaching of the
[1:17:34] word amen it's the holy ghost that is
[1:17:38] moving us into position for
[1:17:41] translation and putting us in
