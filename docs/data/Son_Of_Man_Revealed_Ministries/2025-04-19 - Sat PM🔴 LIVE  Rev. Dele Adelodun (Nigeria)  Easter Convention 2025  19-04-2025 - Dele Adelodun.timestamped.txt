[43:10] of prayer. Thank you, Jesus. Gracious

[43:29] us. Hallelujah. They will never forsake
[43:32] us. They will go with us all the days of
[43:35] our lives. We thank you for what Messi
[43:38] did and we thank you for what your mercy
[43:41] is still doing.
[43:43] We thank you for the blessings
[43:46] that we have received from you
[43:49] because we know you are an inexhaustible
[43:52] fountain.
[43:53] We have come for more again tonight.
[43:56] Amen. I pray for a yielding
[43:59] on my part and on the part of your
[44:01] audience. And Lord, you will give grace
[44:05] to the auction to the preacher and grace
[44:08] to the hearer.
[44:10] Please come out from the pages of your
[44:12] holy word and reveal thyself to us
[44:16] individually.
[44:18] Help us to see what you have done for
[44:20] us. And may you raise our faith to such
[44:23] a level. Hallelujah. until we shall
[44:25] claim our inheritances.
[44:27] Be our help. One more time we pray.
[44:30] Bless the labors of your servants.
[44:33] Bless, oh God, the dedication of your
[44:36] people. All the sacrifices that they
[44:39] have made, oh God. To make these
[44:42] meetings, oh possible under your grace.
[44:46] Lord, may they never lose their reward.
[44:49] One more time, may you move through the
[44:51] audience of your people. May you stop at
[44:54] the post of each personal. Please
[44:57] discern their needs and grant to them
[45:00] the substance of their requests. Grant
[45:03] their desires. Almighty God, visit them
[45:07] like never before.
[45:10] Glory to the lives of your children. We
[45:13] are asking for other places where
[45:15] believers are gathered both in the
[45:18] country here and in other parts of the
[45:21] world that your presence will abide with
[45:24] your people. May the God of Easter bring
[45:27] a quickening to everything that the
[45:30] winters of life had frozen. Oh God, that
[45:34] Lord your sunrise will to them and give
[45:38] us life. Do it Lord. Let it be a season
[45:42] like never before. A season that we
[45:45] shall have that testimony from that
[45:47] time. Grant it to your people. You know
[45:49] their needs. I don't know. But Lord, I
[45:52] pray that you will give me such a
[45:54] yielding that through my vessel, you
[45:56] will speak to the needs of your people,
[45:59] and you will bless them there, Father.
[46:01] If there be souls that are still on
[46:03] their way, may you guide their paths.
[46:06] Amen. Amen. those that are in their
[46:08] houses, may you give them a quickening.
[46:11] Prepare the art of those that are here.
[46:14] At the end of all things, we will we
[46:16] give you glory in the name of the Lord
[46:19] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[46:24] Amen.
[46:25] [Applause]
[46:29] The Lord bless you, saints.
[46:32] The Lord bless you. Amen. That sounds
[46:35] better. Hallelujah. The Lord bless you.
[46:39] Amen. Hallelujah. Yeah. Saying God bless
[46:43] you must not get common.
[46:45] Amen. Not to elicit our Amen.
[46:48] Hallelujah. Amen. When we say it, we
[46:50] mean it from our heart.
[46:53] When you amen it, the blessings of God
[46:55] will be yours.
[46:57] You know, there was one of the new
[46:59] year's messages. The prophet said, I
[47:01] wouldn't say happy new year. Yeah. He
[47:04] said I mean not that he's against it is
[47:07] but I will say God bless you. He said
[47:10] because if God bless you the happiness
[47:13] of the new year and every other thing is
[47:16] inside that bless you. So that statement
[47:20] holds holds a lot for us. Amen. And may
[47:23] God bless you richly. Amen. Amen. All
[47:27] right. Not to keep you standing, I will
[47:31] humbly request that we read our Bible.
[47:33] Amen.
[47:35] We are still in our subject when the
[47:38] Lord said it is finished.
[47:41] Amen. I hope we can maybe we can run
[47:45] that up tonight and see. No, we'll still
[47:48] be in it in a way. All right, let's just
[47:51] leave there. All right. John
[47:53] chapter 19. Yes.
[48:00] For tonight, we're going to read those
[48:02] other accounts a little because we were
[48:05] going to the third aspect of when the
[48:08] Lord said, "It is finished." We have
[48:10] looked at the the veil of the temple.
[48:13] Amen. And then we looked at it very
[48:16] well. We also looked a bit into the
[48:19] lampstanding. Yes. To make redemption
[48:22] claims. Amen. So we want to see the
[48:24] graves of the saints being open tonight.
[48:28] Amen. So John chapter 19 verse
[48:39] [Music]
[48:43] 3030 And when Jesus therefore had
[48:47] received the vinegar,
[48:49] he said, "It is finished." and he bowed
[48:53] his head and gave up the ghost.
[48:56] Amen. Amen. Matthew chapter
[49:04] 27. Matthew
[49:15] 27. The account of Matthew 27 and Mark
[49:18] 15 are the same. So let's take it from
[49:21] Matthew 27:E1
[49:23] 15. Jesus when he had cried with a loud
[49:27] voice yielded up the ghost. And behold
[49:32] the veil of the temple was rent into him
[49:35] from the top to the bottom. And the
[49:39] earth did quake and the rocks rent and
[49:43] the graves were opened. And many bodies
[49:46] of the saints which left arose. and came
[49:50] out of the graves after his
[49:53] resurrection and went into the holy city
[49:56] and appeared unto many. Amen. May the
[50:00] Lord add his blessings to the reading of
[50:03] his holy word.
[50:05] God bless you. You may please be seated.
[50:08] [Music]
[50:19] Once again, I would like to appreciate
[50:22] uh the servants of God uh who are host
[50:26] in this meetings and uh and all the
[50:30] other servants of God who are also
[50:33] supported. I pray that the Lord bless
[50:35] you, bless your ministries and uh with
[50:39] the kind of response we have received
[50:41] from the saints, it shows you have done
[50:44] a very mighty work. So it makes it easy
[50:47] to preach to your congregation. I pray
[50:50] that the Lord will continue to enrich
[50:52] your ministries in the name of Jesus
[50:55] Christ. I also appreciate all the saints
[50:58] who have been coming to the meetings. I
[51:01] know it takes a lot of sacrifice for you
[51:04] to do all that you are doing and I pray
[51:07] that the Lord will richly reward your
[51:10] sacrifice and your effort in the name of
[51:13] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. So
[51:16] tonight we are still on when the Lord
[51:20] said it is finished. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[51:25] But we want to look at the third
[51:28] aspect. I told us at the beginning of
[51:31] the study yesterday morning that when
[51:34] the Lord said it is finished uh three
[51:38] things happened. Amen. Amen. And uh the
[51:43] gospels gave us account of two of those
[51:47] three things and also the revelation of
[51:51] the loud voice. Amen. But if you go
[51:55] further in the book of Revelation, it
[51:59] gave us the account of the third thing.
[52:02] The third thing that happened took place
[52:04] in heaven. Then one took place on the
[52:07] earth and the other took place beneath
[52:10] the earth.
[52:11] So the uh the that voice when the Lord
[52:16] when it is finished Yes. actually
[52:19] affected several dimensions and uh it
[52:22] meant different things to different
[52:25] people.
[52:26] Amen. And uh it took care of the past.
[52:31] It took care of the present and it has
[52:34] also taken care of the future.
[52:37] So the bride is permanently secure.
[52:41] We have nothing to be afraid of. We on
[52:44] the Lord's side.
[52:46] So we want to look a bit into the past
[52:49] that was taken care of. Amen. This
[52:52] evening. Amen. Now along the study I
[52:55] told us that all the saints who died
[52:59] before Christ came couldn't go into the
[53:02] presence of God. Yes. Because they lived
[53:05] under the blood of bulls and goats
[53:10] which cannot do a work of remittance.
[53:13] Amen. But the blood only did a job of
[53:17] covering.
[53:19] But when you cover something is still
[53:21] there. You cover what is existing.
[53:26] But the the real the real payment will
[53:29] be something to take it away.
[53:32] Because really it must not be there and
[53:35] what we are talking about here is the
[53:38] sins of the people. Okay. And the
[53:41] prophet of the Lord told us that sin
[53:43] must be judged. Then for sin to be
[53:46] judged, it must be placed on the person.
[53:49] Amen. Amen. And that was why it was
[53:52] necessary for the perfect land. Yes. To
[53:56] come and pay that penalty. Amen. And
[53:59] then we told us that he did not only
[54:02] pay, he became our sin so that we can
[54:06] become his righteousness. Hallelujah.
[54:08] That was why our sin was judged in his
[54:11] body and by his payment he broke the
[54:14] chemical compound of sin and sent it
[54:17] back to where it came from.
[54:20] To send it back to where it come from,
[54:22] we shall see this evening. The prophet
[54:24] said there must be a barrier.
[54:27] Hallelujah. And he took that back to
[54:30] Romans chapter 6. That when we accept
[54:34] the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. Amen. We go
[54:37] for water baptism. Amen. Which Jesus our
[54:40] Lord told us that water baptism brings
[54:43] remission. Amen. Why it's able to bring
[54:46] remission is because it it water baptism
[54:49] involves burial. Amen. That is why Paul
[54:52] said as we are buried in the likeness of
[54:55] his death.
[54:57] Are you following? The burial in the
[55:00] likeness of his death means the taking
[55:02] away of our sins. Amen. Amen. So as we
[55:06] are buried in the likeness of his death,
[55:09] so when we are raised from the water, we
[55:13] are raised in the likeness of his
[55:14] resurrection.
[55:16] So that process also speak of death,
[55:19] burial and resurrection.
[55:21] Amen. We must be ready to die to
[55:23] ourselves. We must be ready to die to
[55:26] sin. None of us can deliver ourselves
[55:29] from sin or any other. That is why God
[55:33] does not want you to live a life of
[55:34] struggle. He has not asked any man to
[55:37] fight to overcome sin. If somebody tells
[55:41] you that they've misplaced the gospel,
[55:44] what God needs from you is the readiness
[55:46] in your heart. If thou will, are you
[55:50] willing tonight? If this is the
[55:52] readiness in your heart, he will take it
[55:54] off from there. Because the power to
[55:57] overcome sin belongs to God alone. So he
[56:01] That's why the prophet said, "Don't
[56:03] struggle to be a Christian."
[56:06] And I have another quotation where he
[56:08] said, "Don't struggle to quit anything."
[56:11] He said, "I'm struggling to quit my
[56:13] smoking. I'm struggling to quit my dirty
[56:16] life. As long as you are struggling, you
[56:18] will never overcome. That battle is
[56:21] beyond you. Don't struggle to do it." He
[56:24] said what you need to do is to accept
[56:28] what he has done that it is meant for me
[56:32] and believe it. He said then as you
[56:36] believe more of God enters and as God
[56:40] enters it gives quick notice. It's a
[56:44] gradual experience or it is a sure
[56:47] experience.
[56:48] But you will definitely celebrate. He
[56:51] would definitely testify. That is why my
[56:54] brother, my sister, no matter how bad
[56:57] you feel you are. Don't stop coming to
[57:00] church.
[57:03] You will never get any better outside of
[57:07] the church. Come to church in good
[57:10] times. Come to church in bad times. If
[57:14] you are rising and falling, come to
[57:16] church. The church is God's clinic. is
[57:20] not meant only for the healthy. He's
[57:22] meant for the sick.
[57:29] Hallelujah.
[57:30] Amen. Those who are healthy will find
[57:33] edification.
[57:35] Those who are sick will find healing.
[57:38] They will find deliverance. They will
[57:40] find breakthrough. I tell you that woman
[57:43] at the well whose name we don't know,
[57:45] the Saman woman was always in church.
[57:49] despite a poor condition. You say, "How
[57:52] do you know?" When Isaiah came our way
[57:56] and did the display of the Messiah, did
[57:59] you hear what she said? She said, "They
[58:02] told us that when Messiah come, this is
[58:06] what he shall do." They told us, who
[58:10] told her? She was coming to church,
[58:14] faith cometh by hearing, hearing the
[58:17] word of God. And she believed what they
[58:19] told her. And she was always in church
[58:23] despite her condition. And one day,
[58:27] hallelujah.
[58:29] She had an encounter
[58:32] with the God of the church.
[58:37] Hallelujah.
[58:39] You know, you know that man that they
[58:41] pulled Bethesda for 37 years or so or
[58:45] was it 41? You know the number of years.
[58:50] 38 years. Thank you. He was always
[58:52] there. He never left the place. And for
[58:56] 38 years he failed. He said, "Anytime I
[59:00] want to get into the water, another
[59:02] person gets in before me." But he kept
[59:06] faith.
[59:08] If it doesn't happen today, it's going
[59:11] to happen tomorrow.
[59:14] And one day the angel who trles the
[59:18] water came in person seeing his
[59:22] dedication and he said brother will thou
[59:26] be made whole.
[59:28] You will have that one day encounter and
[59:31] it will be like it never before.
[59:33] Congressman Hobshaw was going to church
[59:37] for 60 something years. He never failed.
[59:41] His faith kept rising. Hallelujah. Every
[59:45] day, every week, every month, every year
[59:51] and devotion for 60 something years.
[59:55] Hallelujah. Can I tell you his day came
[59:59] and your day will come.
[1:00:03] Church is good for sick people.
[1:00:06] Sin sick, disease sick, sickness sick.
[1:00:11] So come to church.
[1:00:14] You are better of inside than outside.
[1:00:19] [Applause]
[1:00:25] God bless you.
[1:00:28] God bless you.
[1:00:32] All right. You love him tonight.
[1:00:35] [Applause]
[1:00:37] Okay.
[1:00:38] So if I keep going this way,
[1:00:43] the Lord will help us.
[1:00:48] All right. I want to focus on tonight.
[1:00:51] But I think it's part of it also. So
[1:00:54] don't struggle to quit anything. Just
[1:00:57] only believe. The Lord will take care of
[1:00:59] you. When when when when you are ready,
[1:01:04] God is ready. He said a broken and a
[1:01:07] contrite spirit the Lord will not
[1:01:10] despise. That is all he needs from you.
[1:01:13] Many a time we don't get it because we
[1:01:16] are not contrite enough. Amen. Some of
[1:01:19] us come at the spore of the moment. Oh
[1:01:23] my friend is coming to the altar. I must
[1:01:26] do something about it. No. God must
[1:01:28] touch you individually.
[1:01:31] It must be personal experience.
[1:01:35] Some of us come still with a regret of
[1:01:38] the wages of iniquity that we are going
[1:01:41] to be separated from. So I won't enjoy
[1:01:45] this again. So I won't enjoy this again.
[1:01:48] As long as you come with such regret,
[1:01:50] you won't encounter God.
[1:01:53] Your mouth and your heart must be in
[1:01:55] agreement.
[1:01:56] Not beyond your mouth. God sees your
[1:01:58] heart. So no matter what you claim, he
[1:02:01] sees who you are.
[1:02:03] But if your heart and your mouth get
[1:02:05] together, a broken and a contrite
[1:02:08] spirit, God will not dispatch.
[1:02:12] God becomes obligated when you truly
[1:02:16] repented and take his name in water
[1:02:19] baptism. He becomes obligated to fill
[1:02:22] you with the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:28] You love him this evening. Praise God.
[1:02:31] Amen. So there must be a barrier. Amen.
[1:02:36] And uh but let me start like
[1:02:41] this. The Bible told us he said when he
[1:02:44] said it is
[1:02:46] finished, one of the
[1:02:49] effects was the dimension
[1:02:52] below which was the quickening of the
[1:02:56] graves.
[1:02:58] Amen. Amen. But I want to quickly say
[1:03:01] this, brethren,
[1:03:03] the graves that were quipped and opened
[1:03:08] were just of those
[1:03:12] who died.
[1:03:14] In the hope of the coming Christ
[1:03:18] [Music]
[1:03:20] wonderful.
[1:03:22] It wasn't the grave of everybody.
[1:03:25] That's right. How meticulous could God
[1:03:28] bring be
[1:03:30] to distinctively
[1:03:32] Hallelujah pick up the graves
[1:03:36] that are meant for resurrection
[1:03:40] think about that a little
[1:03:44] that same just God is still here tonight
[1:03:49] friends we may come as a family even as
[1:03:54] a group to the house of the Lord
[1:03:56] But our dealing with God or God's
[1:03:59] dealing with us is individual.
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:05] This is why your attention must not be
[1:04:07] on anyone
[1:04:09] but on Christ.
[1:04:11] [Applause]
[1:04:14] Friendship and association is handed
[1:04:16] outside. When we come here, you must
[1:04:19] know what you come for.
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:22] And don't be busy with no other person.
[1:04:25] Because perhaps you don't know what they
[1:04:27] came for.
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:32] Amen.
[1:04:34] Because even to the grave, Yes. God
[1:04:38] marked the grave of those who were
[1:04:41] waiting,
[1:04:42] who died, who lived, who did everything
[1:04:48] in the hope of the coming Christ.
[1:04:52] So I want to say this first. Yes. That
[1:04:55] it wasn't every grave that quipped
[1:04:59] and open.
[1:05:00] Some remain dead cold starting, winter
[1:05:04] and permanent.
[1:05:06] They will come up sometime but not dead.
[1:05:12] Amen. Pick every statement because we're
[1:05:17] going to take God out of history. We're
[1:05:20] going to bring into present tense. Amen.
[1:05:23] If the Bible is only a book of history,
[1:05:26] we are wasting our time here.
[1:05:29] But we shall see how this is going to
[1:05:30] play itself back in this last days.
[1:05:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:37] Whose graves were this.
[1:05:40] Now these people
[1:05:44] themselves they knew where resurrection
[1:05:48] and rapture will take place. Yes. Amen.
[1:05:52] Let me say this church, resurrection and
[1:05:55] rapture has always had its location.
[1:05:57] Amen.
[1:06:00] Amen. Amen. Yes. The one I'm talking
[1:06:04] about and we divide them very soon. But
[1:06:07] the one I'm talking about has its
[1:06:10] location. It wouldn't take place
[1:06:12] everywhere.
[1:06:15] Some of these saints lived in Egypt.
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:23] They lived the best of their years
[1:06:26] in Egypt. Somebody like Joseph
[1:06:29] lived all his adult years in Egypt.
[1:06:34] He became so successful in Egypt.
[1:06:38] But he remained not an Egyptian.
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:46] Hallelujah.
[1:06:49] It must have been a disservice to the
[1:06:51] citizenship
[1:06:53] of Egypt when Joseph told his brethren,
[1:06:57] I know that the Lord will surely visit
[1:06:59] you as he promised.
[1:07:03] Because the promise he gave to Abraham
[1:07:05] by covenant in Genesis 15 became a
[1:07:08] generational heritage. Amen. Yes. It was
[1:07:12] passed on generation to generation.
[1:07:15] Amen. that they will indeed so join in
[1:07:18] the land that is not here. But the Lord
[1:07:20] will bring them out with a mighty hand
[1:07:22] to the land he has given to them for a
[1:07:25] possession. That land he held a lot both
[1:07:29] for those who were living and those who
[1:07:31] were dead. Amen.
[1:07:36] That was why Joseph said, "I know the
[1:07:38] Lord will surely visit you in that
[1:07:41] visitation. No matter how busy preient
[1:07:44] or how urgent your journey is, make sure
[1:07:47] you don't leave my bones here.
[1:07:51] Hallelujah. So for many numbers of
[1:07:54] years, the bones of Joseph was never
[1:07:57] buried. Yeah. And the prophet said it
[1:08:00] became a symbol of hope,
[1:08:03] a symbol of the promised visitation, to
[1:08:06] every Israelites that no matter what
[1:08:09] they are going through in the hands of
[1:08:11] the tax masters when they look at the
[1:08:14] bones of Joseph Monday,
[1:08:19] there will be a visitation.
[1:08:24] Oh, what a blessed hope we have.
[1:08:27] Hallelujah. Do you know it was so
[1:08:29] important to Jacob? Yes. Until he made
[1:08:32] his sons to swear to him.
[1:08:36] Serious business you think. And I tell
[1:08:39] you serious business.
[1:08:41] He told them he said, "I'm going the way
[1:08:44] of all her." Yes. And I shall soon be
[1:08:46] gathered to my people. Yes. But make
[1:08:49] sure you don't bury my body.
[1:08:54] Excuse me. Come swear to me that you
[1:08:56] won't do it. Joseph must have said papa
[1:08:58] I believe what I will do. Let's make it
[1:09:02] a
[1:09:04] to understood the seriousness.
[1:09:08] You know why those folks had great
[1:09:11] revelation
[1:09:13] of what of where resurrection and
[1:09:17] rapture
[1:09:19] will take place.
[1:09:22] Amen. Hallelujah. Let me tell you
[1:09:24] resurrection and rapture also as it
[1:09:28] location today. Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] [Applause]
[1:09:33] Okay. To help you, let me divide it for
[1:09:35] you. There are two resurrections coming.
[1:09:39] And I want you to know the one I'm
[1:09:40] saying for very for clarity.
[1:09:43] I will put it like this. There's going
[1:09:45] to be a better resurrection. Amen. I'm
[1:09:48] using the language of the scripture.
[1:09:50] Yes. And there's a resurrection. Maybe
[1:09:52] we can call good for some, bad for some.
[1:09:56] When the Bible spoke in Hebrews 11, he
[1:09:59] called a resurrection a better one.
[1:10:04] To me as if I'm speaking straight. Now
[1:10:08] the better resurrection is the one I'm
[1:10:10] talking about. Amen. Usually in English
[1:10:12] language, you start from good, better,
[1:10:15] best. But in spiritual language, God
[1:10:18] always start from the best. Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] So is best better good
[1:10:24] or since we are comparing between just
[1:10:26] two things here by the use of the word
[1:10:28] better this better one will come first
[1:10:32] and the good or the bad depending on the
[1:10:34] side people are will come later
[1:10:39] this better one I'm talking about is
[1:10:41] going to be the first resurrection but I
[1:10:44] want to say tonight it's going to have
[1:10:46] its location
[1:10:50] Amen. The universality of the
[1:10:53] resurrection and rapture in the first
[1:10:56] has to speak with you know certain
[1:10:59] people. Amen. Amen. Who are scattered
[1:11:03] all over the earth.
[1:11:05] That is the only universality.
[1:11:08] But this rapture, this resurrection and
[1:11:10] rapture is not going to happen to
[1:11:12] everybody.
[1:11:15] It's only the same people who shared the
[1:11:18] same thing. who lives in the same place,
[1:11:23] who eats the same food
[1:11:28] wherever they are, even if they are
[1:11:30] buried in the sea, it's only those ones
[1:11:34] that will come up
[1:11:39] because rapture, the first one,
[1:11:42] resurrection and rapture at location. As
[1:11:46] a matter of fact, the second one has no
[1:11:48] rapture. Yes, that's right. Amen.
[1:11:53] The second resurrection has no rapture.
[1:11:56] The first one is the one that has
[1:11:58] rapture.
[1:12:00] Glory.
[1:12:02] Hallelujah. Wonderful. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:07] Amen. And this
[1:12:09] resurrection is called better because it
[1:12:13] has some benefits
[1:12:15] that the other one does not have.
[1:12:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This
[1:12:21] resurrection I'm talking about as
[1:12:23] rapture. Amen. That's one. As wedding
[1:12:26] supper. Two. As the millennium. Three.
[1:12:32] Gives you the privilege of sitting as a
[1:12:34] judge. Yes. In the white throne
[1:12:37] judgment.
[1:12:39] And when eternity rolls in, you have
[1:12:41] eternal residency inside the first city.
[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:12:49] Whoever does not make it in that
[1:12:51] resurrection
[1:12:53] or that body change or that rapture will
[1:12:57] miss all those five benefits.
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:03] That is the word, brother.
[1:13:06] So when the Bible call it a better
[1:13:08] resurrection in Hebrews 11, the Bible
[1:13:10] knew what he was talking about.
[1:13:14] Hallelujah. Brother Abraham said, "I'm a
[1:13:16] daily riser." He said, "So I will come
[1:13:18] up in the flesh."
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:23] God bless my people. See what they wrote
[1:13:25] there. Women received their dead breast
[1:13:27] to life again and others were tortured.
[1:13:30] not accepting deliverance that they
[1:13:33] might obtain what better a better.
[1:13:37] So if there's a better resurrection that
[1:13:39] means the scripture is comparing between
[1:13:41] two resurrections.
[1:13:44] Are you catching it? Hallelujah. Praise
[1:13:46] the Lord. Amen.
[1:13:49] Hallelujah.
[1:13:51] Amen. For you to be in that better
[1:13:54] resurrection
[1:13:56] and if you are alive in that body change
[1:14:00] experience, you've got to be located
[1:14:04] [Applause]
[1:14:05] somewhere
[1:14:07] because the Bible type
[1:14:10] shows that rapture, resurrection never
[1:14:14] took place anywhere else. Amen. other
[1:14:17] than in the promised land. Yes, that's
[1:14:20] right. Glory to God. It was completely
[1:14:23] localized.
[1:14:25] That was why Israel and Abraham and all
[1:14:28] the rest refused to be buried elsewhere.
[1:14:32] Tell me where resurrection was going to
[1:14:34] take place.
[1:14:37] Hallelujah. Amen. And friends, refuse to
[1:14:40] live elsewhere.
[1:14:42] refuse to be buried elsewhere because in
[1:14:45] these last days
[1:14:48] resurrection and rapture is also going
[1:14:51] to be localized.
[1:14:54] I say it with all sense of
[1:14:56] responsibility.
[1:14:58] Hallelujah.
[1:15:00] Amen. If you miss the location, you go
[1:15:02] nowhere.
[1:15:07] In first Thessalonians chapter 4, Amen.
[1:15:12] The Bible says the Lord will descend.
[1:15:16] That's right. Giving three things.
[1:15:20] Shout.
[1:15:22] Voice.
[1:15:23] Trumpet. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Voice
[1:15:27] is connected to resurrection. Yes. Of
[1:15:30] the sleeping saints. Is that right?
[1:15:32] Amen. But the shout prepares the living.
[1:15:36] [Applause]
[1:15:37] That's right. So if while you are
[1:15:40] leaving you miss the shout, how would
[1:15:43] you get the voice?
[1:15:48] Are you seeing the location?
[1:15:52] Because the shout is what give you an
[1:15:56] evidence, a vindication that you have
[1:15:58] been chosen as a bride. And it is the
[1:16:01] shout that gosp to put you in marriage.
[1:16:06] I said marriage.
[1:16:08] I give marriage.
[1:16:11] The marriage takes place here.
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:17] They shall put you in marriage to your
[1:16:21] bridegroom
[1:16:22] so that both of you will change status
[1:16:25] from bride to wife and from bridegroom
[1:16:28] to husband.
[1:16:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This is where we
[1:16:33] can rejoice
[1:16:35] as the spiritual intercourse
[1:16:38] that is given unto you is pleasurable to
[1:16:42] you. Anytime you come to the house of
[1:16:44] the Lord, what are you receiving? Seeds
[1:16:47] of your husband.
[1:16:50] In order to bring forth.
[1:16:52] [Applause]
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:55] [Applause]
[1:16:57] Hallelujah.
[1:16:59] How can you miss that? and you leave and
[1:17:03] expect to come up. It's not possible.
[1:17:09] [Applause]
[1:17:15] You love him.
[1:17:17] You got to be wife to him here.
[1:17:21] This is why Revelations 10 8 to 11 says
[1:17:25] you must prophesy. Do you know what that
[1:17:28] means? Amen. The testimony of Jesus
[1:17:31] Christ is a spirit of prophecy. You must
[1:17:35] give an evidence. You must produce
[1:17:37] Christ on two feet.
[1:17:41] Life of his life, power of his power,
[1:17:44] work of his word, of his. She
[1:17:54] is the same scripture that applies for
[1:17:57] him. Yeah. Is now applied to you.
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:05] [Applause]
[1:18:08] I wish we could talk. Okay, maybe
[1:18:09] tomorrow will come into your own
[1:18:11] personal instant. Amen. Because you must
[1:18:14] see what this message has done for you.
[1:18:18] It is what was waved over you to give
[1:18:21] you your own resurrection
[1:18:24] that will give you your own body change.
[1:18:29] [Applause]
[1:18:30] Hallelujah.
[1:18:33] So you can't miss the shout
[1:18:36] and get the voice. Hallelujah. And if
[1:18:38] you miss the voice, you can't be
[1:18:41] gathered by the trumpet.
[1:18:44] For your solar page,
[1:18:50] you know, for for Enoch, all the Bible
[1:18:53] told was Enoch walked with God. Amen.
[1:18:58] Hallelujah.
[1:19:00] Amen. So there must be a walk with God.
[1:19:04] Before you will not be seen.
[1:19:09] It's a daily continuous walk with God.
[1:19:13] Until one day you will step onto the
[1:19:15] king's highway and gravitation will lose
[1:19:18] hope.
[1:19:20] Then we shall disprove science that says
[1:19:24] whatever goes on must come down. We will
[1:19:27] answer is no. If we go up, we will only
[1:19:31] come down when we are ready.
[1:19:36] Because gravitation
[1:19:38] will lose hold
[1:19:41] on certain people. Yes sir. But you must
[1:19:44] be found on the right ground. Amen.
[1:19:47] Amen. Amen. That's right. You see why
[1:19:50] you must come out of loud this year.
[1:19:53] Are you seeing the blending? Yes. Lesia
[1:19:56] holds nothing for you. Blind, wretched,
[1:20:00] miserable, naked
[1:20:02] and
[1:20:04] as long as you leave him there. No
[1:20:06] rapture.
[1:20:07] Pentecostals are in love this year.
[1:20:12] The church world is in love this year.
[1:20:15] But something called us out of now.
[1:20:19] The message of the home, the reveal
[1:20:22] work, the temple. The opening of the
[1:20:26] seals put us into a junction that
[1:20:31] condition no longer help us and we have
[1:20:34] come out
[1:20:37] [Applause]
[1:20:40] into the age of the bride where all
[1:20:43] things are possible. We have holiness is
[1:20:46] not a place. It's a way of laughing
[1:20:50] because the message we hear the season
[1:20:53] of holy decency
[1:21:00] the secret place of the most high.
[1:21:04] How do you expect to leave Egypt if you
[1:21:07] were not in ghost?
[1:21:10] Come on church. Show me your time.
[1:21:13] Hallelujah. You didn't believe in go.
[1:21:16] You didn't believe go message
[1:21:20] goian has it message. Go was different
[1:21:23] from Egypt.
[1:21:25] Go ask the pillar of fire.
[1:21:28] Amen. They don't dispute the pillar of
[1:21:30] fire in
[1:21:32] they don't doubt the pillar of cloud in
[1:21:34] G. Yeah, as the blood of the atonement,
[1:21:38] the Passover lamb, caution at the
[1:21:41] messenger, and by that question at the
[1:21:44] work, for the hour, Egypt had none of
[1:21:48] it. You stay in Egypt, you die. You live
[1:21:52] in motion, you are delivered.
[1:21:56] We have come to portion of this house.
[1:21:59] Amen.
[1:22:01] In the evening time, it shall be light.
[1:22:03] Yes, there was darkness in Egypt, but
[1:22:06] there was light in God. The conditions
[1:22:09] were not the same at the hour of Exodus.
[1:22:13] We are nearing another living. Another
[1:22:16] going home and the conditions can no
[1:22:19] longer be the same.
[1:22:21] Amen. The church must die.
[1:22:27] You know why
[1:22:28] they said they will die? The church is
[1:22:31] dead. Yes.
[1:22:36] The absence of life gives death. They
[1:22:39] push out Christ. Laia rejected Christ.
[1:22:43] Christ was standing outside.
[1:22:46] Isn't that what the scripture said? He
[1:22:48] was standing outside. Life was outside.
[1:22:52] Light was outside.
[1:22:54] Uh-huh. And from his body language and
[1:22:57] his expression, he wasn't willing to
[1:22:59] come in.
[1:23:02] He said, "Behold, I stand."
[1:23:05] Amen. He wasn't willing to come in to
[1:23:07] bring revival and dispensational
[1:23:10] salvation again. But he began to call to
[1:23:14] individuals.
[1:23:15] [Applause]
[1:23:17] Hallelujah. So you were once locked in
[1:23:20] that prison house. Amen. But the word of
[1:23:23] the Lord came to you to call you out of
[1:23:27] the prison house of death.
[1:23:30] Amen. When he called you out, he brought
[1:23:33] into an economy where the council of God
[1:23:37] is ruling.
[1:23:40] That is the age of the bride. This is
[1:23:42] the economy where we are. Amen.
[1:23:47] That is why our life is transformed.
[1:23:51] We enjoyed only one thing here.
[1:23:52] spiritual food
[1:23:55] in season which gives us access to
[1:23:58] everything we have need of even when the
[1:24:01] doctors have failed we can still get our
[1:24:04] healing
[1:24:06] amen everything we need that we ever
[1:24:08] need is right in here
[1:24:12] [Applause]
[1:24:14] glory to God so these folks who were
[1:24:18] looking up to it Amen Amen.
[1:24:22] They live so well in that hope. If you
[1:24:25] read, if you read Hebrews 11, it says
[1:24:28] something tells them that there's a city
[1:24:32] somewhere
[1:24:34] who's builder,
[1:24:36] and maker
[1:24:38] is God.
[1:24:41] Simple scripture.
[1:24:43] And because that thing was registered in
[1:24:46] their hearts, they professed to be what?
[1:24:50] Piggy and strangers.
[1:24:54] A lot of them were wealthy, but they
[1:24:57] never lived by their wealth. Amen. They
[1:25:01] lived by the hope of the coming Christ.
[1:25:04] What they heard and what they do not
[1:25:07] have never bothered them. Amen. Because
[1:25:10] they've received a bear of great prize.
[1:25:15] Yes, sir. Glory to pilgrims don't dig
[1:25:19] deep
[1:25:21] in the land of their pilgrimage. Yes.
[1:25:24] That was why they were living in tents.
[1:25:27] Something that is easily removable. Yes.
[1:25:30] Because when they move, they move.
[1:25:33] Glory. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. They
[1:25:37] evidently proved Yes. that their comfort
[1:25:40] did not reside here. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:44] And they were so happy to tell anybody
[1:25:46] the hope that is in them. Yes. I'm a
[1:25:50] pilgrim and a stranger.
[1:25:53] Wandering through this world of sin. On
[1:25:55] my way.
[1:25:59] Friends, let's live like that.
[1:26:02] Even if you drive the best car, live
[1:26:04] like that.
[1:26:05] If you live in the best house, live like
[1:26:07] that.
[1:26:09] Your life is not established upon your
[1:26:12] wealth is established upon the sure
[1:26:15] foundation
[1:26:16] of eternal life.
[1:26:20] That is why said what can separate us
[1:26:23] from the love of God from riches to
[1:26:27] want. They said no in all these things
[1:26:31] we are more than conquerors.
[1:26:34] Let that be your experience friends.
[1:26:37] Amen.
[1:26:39] When things are getting so fine with
[1:26:40] you, don't abandon God.
[1:26:43] Before you got the job, we were praying
[1:26:45] for you. If the job now takes you away
[1:26:48] from service
[1:26:50] and is making a mess out of our lives,
[1:26:53] the church has the power to lose and to
[1:26:55] buy because we love your soul. We pray
[1:26:59] against the church.
[1:27:02] [Applause]
[1:27:07] Because for belly, belly for food will
[1:27:10] have an end one day. But there is
[1:27:13] something deep down in a man.
[1:27:16] Amen. And that is where the resides the
[1:27:20] place of eternal life. Amen. You love
[1:27:23] him tonight.
[1:27:25] So these folks were looking forward.
[1:27:29] It never happened in their day. That was
[1:27:33] why they died in the hope. Yes. Of the
[1:27:37] coming Christ. And I tell you, Christ
[1:27:40] never disappointed them. And he will
[1:27:43] never disappoint us. Our Lord is coming
[1:27:46] back to this earth again.
[1:27:49] [Music]
[1:27:50] Amen. Satan will be bound a thousand
[1:27:53] years and we shall have no temper there
[1:27:57] when our Lord will come back.
[1:28:01] Tell your son our Lord is coming back.
[1:28:07] Don't let anybody
[1:28:09] take away the hope of the coming crash.
[1:28:13] These folks died. Yeah, they never saw
[1:28:17] it happen. But they died in that hope
[1:28:21] and Christ never disappointed.
[1:28:24] Christ came
[1:28:26] and he will come again.
[1:28:30] He's a short one of promise. Hallelujah.
[1:28:34] There stood in Jerusalem. Yeah. And they
[1:28:37] were ging and two angels came back and
[1:28:40] said, "Ye men of Jerusalem and Judea,
[1:28:43] why standing gazing?
[1:28:45] Why are you looking hopeless and
[1:28:47] helpless? This same Jesus
[1:28:51] that is ascending.
[1:28:53] One more time we descend.
[1:28:56] I believe you with all my heart. Our
[1:28:59] Lord will come back to
[1:29:05] him.
[1:29:07] And he has started coming.
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:13] Glory. He has started
[1:29:16] the climax of his coming will be his
[1:29:18] physical appearance
[1:29:20] even touch the ground. Amen. But it's
[1:29:24] going to magnetate. It's going to
[1:29:25] magnetize
[1:29:27] those with whom we share similar
[1:29:29] material. It's going to happen one of
[1:29:31] these things. It is the hope that we are
[1:29:34] not ashamed. The hope that which we
[1:29:37] comfort one another.
[1:29:39] [Applause]
[1:29:41] Amen.
[1:29:43] So this brethren died in that hope and
[1:29:48] it looked like everything gone uh you
[1:29:51] know went quiet. That's right. It looks
[1:29:55] like everything became hopeless. Do you
[1:29:58] know even when Christ came because of
[1:30:00] his burial
[1:30:02] Yes. the disciples became discomforted
[1:30:06] themselves.
[1:30:09] Hallelujah.
[1:30:11] Oh, the Bible is a true account.
[1:30:17] Peter decided to go back to fishes.
[1:30:22] The ones who went back to fishing were
[1:30:24] confused on the road to Emma.
[1:30:26] And you can see the way when Jesus, you
[1:30:29] know, filled himself and appeared to
[1:30:30] them. You can see the way they reported
[1:30:32] the resurrection story with a sense of
[1:30:35] detachment.
[1:30:37] That's right. Yeah. Because they were
[1:30:39] not sure.
[1:30:44] They said and to make to compound the
[1:30:46] problem,
[1:30:48] certain women of our company
[1:30:52] said they saw him.
[1:30:55] They couldn't hold up. They couldn't
[1:30:57] take ownership.
[1:30:59] That's right.
[1:31:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. You can see how
[1:31:04] it feels. Everything went quiet. Yes.
[1:31:09] And it was happening years upon years.
[1:31:12] Then we saw Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[1:31:16] Amen. He came according to the
[1:31:19] scriptures.
[1:31:21] He did signs and wonders. He did
[1:31:24] everything to create faith in the
[1:31:26] people. To let them know that he was the
[1:31:29] one promised
[1:31:31] from the book of Genesis.
[1:31:34] He even told them to search the
[1:31:36] scriptures. Yes. In them they think they
[1:31:39] have eternal life. This is the thing
[1:31:41] that testify of me.
[1:31:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:46] They were struggling to believe him.
[1:31:50] Some have to wait till he died before
[1:31:52] they can even say, "Oh, indeed this is
[1:31:56] the son of God."
[1:31:58] Upon all those outstanding miracles,
[1:32:01] so if God makes you a believer, you
[1:32:03] should be thankful. Yeah,
[1:32:05] you should be grateful.
[1:32:07] It's election.
[1:32:09] It's predestination,
[1:32:11] not by power, not by night. It is the
[1:32:16] grace of God.
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:21] That's right. The potter who has chosen
[1:32:24] to make you vessels of honor, not
[1:32:26] vessels of rot fitted for destruction.
[1:32:30] The vessels of rot cannot quary him.
[1:32:32] Amen. And the vessels of honor cannot
[1:32:35] appreciate him enough
[1:32:40] friends. He came
[1:32:42] as the scripture said of him and they
[1:32:46] went to the cross. We've gone through
[1:32:47] that already. He went into Gethsemane
[1:32:51] where you know the the the faith of the
[1:32:54] people of the past, the people in the
[1:32:57] present and those of the future, you and
[1:33:00] I, rested upon his decision.
[1:33:04] When he said, "Not my will, let their
[1:33:07] will be done." A few hours later, he was
[1:33:11] moved from the labor room of Gethsemane
[1:33:13] to the delivery room of of Calvary.
[1:33:17] Amen. Amen. And having completed the
[1:33:20] process of delivery
[1:33:22] and the process of dealing with sin once
[1:33:25] and for all. Not only with sin with the
[1:33:28] attribute of sin, death. Because it was
[1:33:31] sin that brought death. So when sin is
[1:33:35] killed, death is guilt.
[1:33:38] The prophet said the way to kill a
[1:33:40] vicious animal for you that are
[1:33:43] he said is not to him for the leg. your
[1:33:46] head. You know why? He has a chance of
[1:33:50] recovery.
[1:33:51] And if the animal recover recovers, you
[1:33:55] are in trouble.
[1:33:57] He said in order to paralyze its body,
[1:34:01] it's a h for the head. Amen. When you
[1:34:05] blow up the head, the entire body dies.
[1:34:11] So Christ a for the real thing. Amen. He
[1:34:15] dealt with sin. Yes. So the sin and all
[1:34:18] his attributes
[1:34:20] can be destroyed.
[1:34:22] When Apostle Paul caught the revelation
[1:34:24] of that dealing, he said, "Oh, oh gave
[1:34:28] way thy power. Oh death, where is thy
[1:34:32] st. Thanks be to God.
[1:34:36] Who gave us power?
[1:34:38] by Calvary.
[1:34:40] Everything you need and you will ever
[1:34:43] need was offered to you by Calvary.
[1:34:47] When he said it is finished,
[1:34:50] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:34:53] Hallelujah.
[1:34:56] When they pronounce that word,
[1:34:58] I'm focusing on this tonight. Among many
[1:35:01] things that we said happened that we've
[1:35:03] shown, there was a great earthquake.
[1:35:06] Amen. Yes. And the earthquake affected
[1:35:11] certain graves. Amen.
[1:35:14] Because the graves of the believers
[1:35:17] who died in the hope of the coming
[1:35:19] Christ was marked by Christ.
[1:35:24] Is still marked till tonight.
[1:35:26] Hallelujah.
[1:35:30] G. So all those m grapes went and they
[1:35:34] were opened. Amen. They were opened on
[1:35:38] Friday.
[1:35:40] That's what the Bible said.
[1:35:42] The occupants came out. It was symbolic.
[1:35:47] Amen. Because the real occupants were
[1:35:50] actually no longer there.
[1:35:54] That is why it was marked. Yes. This was
[1:35:57] where we put him. And on that spot, you
[1:36:00] will come again. Hallelujah.
[1:36:03] Amen. The occupants who were placed in
[1:36:06] those places
[1:36:08] came up. What you actually put there,
[1:36:11] listen to me,
[1:36:14] was the body in which they live. Yes.
[1:36:18] You cannot put a believer
[1:36:21] in the grave.
[1:36:24] Amen. Did you catch that?
[1:36:27] Wow.
[1:36:29] Because it is when the believer vacates
[1:36:32] that body Amen.
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:35] That is why it says dust thou art to
[1:36:39] dust you return wasn't spoken of the
[1:36:42] soul. Yes. Amen. You will never hear the
[1:36:45] Bible say the body that sinnth shall
[1:36:47] die.
[1:36:49] It is the soul.
[1:36:52] Because that is your real you.
[1:36:56] [Applause]
[1:36:59] Amen. Amen. If you are a seed of God,
[1:37:02] that your real you can never be
[1:37:04] dissolved.
[1:37:06] It can never die.
[1:37:10] It's eternal.
[1:37:13] Hallelujah. If God help us to bring a
[1:37:16] personal Easter tomorrow, you will see
[1:37:19] your real you there.
[1:37:22] It's undiable.
[1:37:27] Amen. All right. The moment he vacates
[1:37:31] this body, it stepped into another. Yes.
[1:37:36] And live consciously.
[1:37:39] Do you hear me? All the saints who are
[1:37:42] gone, they are alive tonight.
[1:37:47] Hallelujah. And they live consciously
[1:37:54] by the scripture. They live consciously.
[1:37:58] By the message they live consciously.
[1:38:02] Hallelujah.
[1:38:04] Jesus said the rich man died and Lazarus
[1:38:07] died also. Amen.
[1:38:10] You use the word death language of the
[1:38:12] earth. But he said when both of them
[1:38:15] died, they woke up somewhere.
[1:38:18] And in the place where they woke up at,
[1:38:20] they were conscious. Simple explanation
[1:38:23] of Christ. Amen. The rich man was
[1:38:26] conscious of his suffering,
[1:38:29] of his poverty,
[1:38:31] Amen. in another dimension.
[1:38:35] Until he was begging for water. And
[1:38:37] Lazarus was conscious of his pleasure.
[1:38:40] Hallelujah. Not of my soul in the bosom
[1:38:44] of Abraham.
[1:38:48] Hallelujah.
[1:38:49] We were gracious to have a first time
[1:38:51] account from the prophet who went beyond
[1:38:53] the curtain of time.
[1:38:55] [Applause]
[1:38:57] He went into the region of the lost.
[1:39:00] Amen. And he went beyond the curtain of
[1:39:03] time.
[1:39:05] When his own wife passed,
[1:39:08] he wanted her so bad to come.
[1:39:13] But can you imagine as much as the
[1:39:16] prophet wanted sister to come back, God,
[1:39:19] you know, she was so caught, he was so
[1:39:21] caught up in sorrow that God did
[1:39:23] something unusual. That's right. He
[1:39:25] actually brought Hope back into the
[1:39:27] room. Yes. Amen. To have a conversation.
[1:39:31] Yes. With her husband.
[1:39:33] And in that conversation, hope wasn't
[1:39:36] ready to come back
[1:39:39] as much as he loved
[1:39:42] when he was already feeling the fortest
[1:39:44] of that place. He was rather trying to,
[1:39:47] you know, before she passed, he was ra,
[1:39:49] she was rather trying to get her husband
[1:39:51] to agree to
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:55] reignite. Hallelujah. This is a
[1:39:58] dimension like no other. And when she
[1:40:01] went into that realm being brought back
[1:40:04] to give comfort to her husband, she
[1:40:06] doesn't want to come. She told Bill, he
[1:40:10] said, "You preached about these things,
[1:40:12] but you have never entered into it.
[1:40:19] that stuck with bills for a long time. I
[1:40:23] preach it and never enter. He couldn't
[1:40:26] he couldn't put it together while the
[1:40:28] woman is so much loved would not want to
[1:40:31] come back to him.
[1:40:34] But years will tell
[1:40:37] several years later being matured, old
[1:40:42] and a solid Christian. Yes, he was
[1:40:45] thinking about the heavenlies.
[1:40:47] And God said, "Would you like to see
[1:40:49] beyond the mountain of time?"
[1:40:53] I said, "You have my faith."
[1:40:56] And he was placing his hands like this
[1:40:58] on the bed.
[1:41:00] And God said, "Okay, if you want it, get
[1:41:03] it." And sister was by the side.
[1:41:08] The sister and Mary after the first wife
[1:41:12] was by her side. And uh it said this
[1:41:16] experience was most remarkable.
[1:41:19] And he said why? Because in all the
[1:41:22] multitude of visions that he has ever
[1:41:24] had, yes, there was never a time he ever
[1:41:27] went out of his body.
[1:41:30] But this time around, he went out.
[1:41:34] He saw his body on the bed and he saw
[1:41:38] himself moving
[1:41:40] into another dimension. I don't know how
[1:41:43] to describe the body on the bed then
[1:41:47] maybe dead still or whatever it is but
[1:41:50] I'm glad the God asked to keep sister
[1:41:53] med asleep. Yes.
[1:41:57] Because if she woke up at that time and
[1:41:59] was tapping the husband, there would
[1:42:01] have been a commotion.
[1:42:04] Amen. And and the prophet went beyond
[1:42:08] the cotton of time. In a place where
[1:42:11] there was no there is no yesterday,
[1:42:13] there is no tomorrow. In a place where
[1:42:16] there is no old age, no sickness, he saw
[1:42:20] everybody. Even the people that he
[1:42:22] brought to the Lord at the age 80
[1:42:24] someday then they saw them in the bloom
[1:42:26] of youth 18 year old. Indeed life at
[1:42:31] best is actually very brief.
[1:42:37] He saw them as 3:16.
[1:42:40] Amen. There was no clans of sensations.
[1:42:44] Everybody was just one and the same
[1:42:46] because they in another body. Everybody
[1:42:49] embracing each other. Welcome our
[1:42:52] precious brother. Welcome our precious
[1:42:54] brother. He was having the greatest time
[1:42:57] of his life and he couldn't explain it.
[1:43:02] And as that was going on. Amen. And you
[1:43:06] know the one who was guiding him was
[1:43:08] showing him. He said, "Look at that lady
[1:43:11] that you were married just ago. She was
[1:43:14] 91 years old when you led her to the
[1:43:15] Lord.
[1:43:19] And he said to think that this was what
[1:43:21] I was afraid of.
[1:43:25] Amen. And he said, "Okay, I've enjoyed
[1:43:28] the company of this wonderful people."
[1:43:30] Amen. This is my convert to the Lord. He
[1:43:33] said, "I want to see Jesus."
[1:43:36] And they told him, "Jesus is just a
[1:43:38] little bit high." You were in the 60s
[1:43:41] and the sevens, just a little bit
[1:43:44] higher.
[1:43:46] And exactly these folks are waiting for
[1:43:48] you to present them to Christ.
[1:43:53] Amen.
[1:43:54] He said really there's going to be a
[1:43:57] presentation time whether you like it or
[1:43:59] not. And I hope you like it.
[1:44:01] If you don't like it, there's no
[1:44:03] guarantee. I hope you like it. You will
[1:44:05] kill behind the prophet.
[1:44:09] [Applause]
[1:44:11] If you are
[1:44:12] counted, if you are counted as the jewel
[1:44:15] of Christ for this age, you will lie
[1:44:18] behind the prophet.
[1:44:20] Some are going to lie behind Paul. Some
[1:44:24] will do behind Peter, but you will land
[1:44:27] behind William.
[1:44:29] [Applause]
[1:44:33] [Music]
[1:44:35] Amen. Amen. And he said when the people
[1:44:38] uh of Peter have to go through the same
[1:44:41] say yes sir. When those of Paul have to
[1:44:44] go through the same say yes sir. Then he
[1:44:47] said there hallelujah in a theopernal
[1:44:50] body.
[1:44:52] In the body in which you know all things
[1:44:55] in the body in which you can never be
[1:44:56] deceived. Yeah. Because if any truth of
[1:44:59] the word strike an to you on earth, the
[1:45:03] prophet said is because you heard from
[1:45:05] your
[1:45:08] Did you catch that? So that's your
[1:45:10] guarantee
[1:45:12] protection from deception
[1:45:14] in that body in which you know all
[1:45:18] things.
[1:45:19] Hallelujah.
[1:45:21] He said, "If that is so, if the people
[1:45:24] of Peter make it, mine will make it."
[1:45:28] If the people of Paul make it, mine will
[1:45:31] make it. Because I preach what Peter
[1:45:34] preach.
[1:45:36] I preach what Paul preach. Not many
[1:45:39] preachers can say that. And all those
[1:45:42] believers in their view of body said on
[1:45:46] this we are resting.
[1:45:49] Let me tell you church heaven accepted
[1:45:52] this message.
[1:45:55] So it's too late for somebody attacking
[1:45:58] the rest.
[1:45:59] Too late. Too late for a time waster.
[1:46:04] You are the one of those girls who stood
[1:46:07] to quench the light of the fire of of
[1:46:10] the Statute of Liberty. You're going to
[1:46:13] beat your brains hard.
[1:46:19] The more you attack, the more the
[1:46:20] message is advancing.
[1:46:23] For everyone that is going to apostasy,
[1:46:25] God is bringing many.
[1:46:28] Baptism goes on every day because all
[1:46:31] sons of God who are dead to eternal life
[1:46:35] will come home.
[1:46:37] Every time this is the problem of God,
[1:46:40] God will see to his problem. Brother
[1:46:44] said as for opposition I don't I don't I
[1:46:47] don't deal with it. I don't even give it
[1:46:50] you know I don't glorify it with
[1:46:52] attention. He said because you know why
[1:46:55] God takes care of He's been taking care
[1:46:58] of it. He will continue to take care of
[1:47:01] it all the time. Hallelujah.
[1:47:05] Don't stress yourself. Just keep your
[1:47:08] own focus.
[1:47:09] You have nothing to reply to anybody.
[1:47:12] Let me tell you, it's ongoing time
[1:47:16] and everyone
[1:47:19] will find their way back to their
[1:47:21] origin. I don't know if it happens here.
[1:47:24] If you go to a rural area where you
[1:47:27] allow even your animals to grace freely,
[1:47:31] when the heing shadows begin to fall,
[1:47:33] what do they do? They start finding
[1:47:35] their way back to their owners house.
[1:47:38] None of them will go to a place where
[1:47:42] they never came out from in the morning.
[1:47:45] Everybody will know their houses. We
[1:47:48] have gone to the healing time and
[1:47:51] everybody will go to where they
[1:47:53] originated from.
[1:47:56] [Applause]
[1:47:57] Do you know why there be all kind around
[1:47:59] the message? Mind my language. Around
[1:48:02] not in.
[1:48:04] Do you know why there be all kind?
[1:48:06] Because this is the only light left.
[1:48:09] Yes.
[1:48:12] And every seed, whether good or bad,
[1:48:16] must interact with light in order to
[1:48:20] manufacture their food through the
[1:48:22] process of photosynthetics.
[1:48:25] Is that what they told us? So the grass
[1:48:28] needs sunlight.
[1:48:29] The mess need sunlight.
[1:48:32] The desirable plants need sunlight. The
[1:48:35] poisonous plants need sunlight. Yes. But
[1:48:38] when light strikes upon them, it's not
[1:48:41] going to change the seeds that they have
[1:48:44] from one to another, is only going to
[1:48:47] transform. They are only one seed from
[1:48:51] infancy to maturity.
[1:48:55] That is why every seed
[1:48:58] whether false or genuine needs the
[1:49:01] message of their heart.
[1:49:08] Let me tell you, Judas's scariot needed
[1:49:12] Jesus as much as Peter needed him
[1:49:16] because the dynamics of the true church
[1:49:20] and the false church is in the hand of
[1:49:22] only one man.
[1:49:27] So there's no problem in the message of
[1:49:29] the hour. There could be a lot of noise
[1:49:31] around the message, but inside the
[1:49:34] message is a certain sound.
[1:49:38] Do you hear me?
[1:49:42] The seal of God stand sure. The Lord
[1:49:45] knows those who are his.
[1:49:48] Let noise makers be making noise. Let
[1:49:52] attackers be attacked. They are only
[1:49:54] feeling the cup of their fathers. There
[1:49:57] are those who must be coral. There are
[1:49:59] those who must be. There are those who
[1:50:02] must be. And there are those who must be
[1:50:04] joyful. There are those who must be.
[1:50:08] Hallelujah.
[1:50:10] Every seed must turn to this message. So
[1:50:15] if you see amen, you must preach a
[1:50:17] message for 40 years and is now
[1:50:20] attacking the message. There is nothing
[1:50:22] out of place. It's just number.
[1:50:26] Every seed must come to roost.
[1:50:30] [Applause]
[1:50:33] You know Judas's scariot couldn't go to
[1:50:36] work
[1:50:37] until Jesus inspired him.
[1:50:41] He said who will betray? Who will do
[1:50:43] this? Who will do that? He said what?
[1:50:45] Wait, wait. Then he took his sword and
[1:50:48] gave him to do that. And by the time he
[1:50:50] took it, Jesus was the one who gave him.
[1:50:54] Underline that. By the time he took it,
[1:50:58] It gave him a search. It gave him an
[1:51:00] anointing. Gave him an inspiration. And
[1:51:03] Jesus sealed it. He said that which
[1:51:06] dwell.
[1:51:09] So the dynamics of the first church is
[1:51:11] in the hands of Jesus. The dynamics of
[1:51:14] the true church is in the hand of Jesus.
[1:51:17] [Applause]
[1:51:20] And the message of the hour is the Lord
[1:51:23] Jesus Christ.
[1:51:25] Ah, you got it now. So the benefit of
[1:51:30] the false brethren and the true brethren
[1:51:33] is in this message. All of them must
[1:51:36] interact with the message to manifest
[1:51:39] the character of the seed that is
[1:51:42] inside. That is God's power of
[1:51:45] transformation.
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:52:02] friends. The clock is ticking right.
[1:52:05] It's a pity people find themselves in
[1:52:07] that condition.
[1:52:09] But we are helpless, aren't we? Brother
[1:52:12] says, "Somebody must go that way." You
[1:52:14] know the prophet in the message of David
[1:52:16] of God, he said at times we need to say
[1:52:19] things. And we do it intentionally.
[1:52:23] So you got to pick forth in this message
[1:52:26] because that's what is needed to take
[1:52:28] care of you.
[1:52:29] It's intentionally done. Brother Brown
[1:52:32] said to pin down the crowd. He says some
[1:52:35] will hear it and ponder. Some will move
[1:52:38] out. And be a valley of decision in a
[1:52:41] compound whether to come back or to go
[1:52:44] away and some will stay alive and say
[1:52:46] Lord have mercy upon me. One statement,
[1:52:50] several reactions. You are reacting by
[1:52:53] the seed that you are.
[1:53:03] [Applause]
[1:53:05] and accepted his message.
[1:53:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That was you,
[1:53:12] brother. Hallelujah.
[1:53:15] Amen. Amen. So he said, I preach what
[1:53:18] preach I preach. I preach what Paul
[1:53:21] preach. And the believer said on this we
[1:53:23] are resting. Are you resting on it? Are
[1:53:27] you resting on it? He said if you stay
[1:53:30] by these things, I will meet you in the
[1:53:33] morning.
[1:53:34] is so certain there will be another
[1:53:37] victory
[1:53:46] after all that he's just feeling so good
[1:53:49] he couldn't explain it he said all he
[1:53:52] felt is wrong that was what defined
[1:53:54] perfect love to brother he understood it
[1:53:57] by experience
[1:54:00] then his guides told him excuse me sir
[1:54:04] It's time to go back.
[1:54:06] Brother said, "Go where?"
[1:54:11] You mean that we have to leave where I
[1:54:12] am?
[1:54:14] Uhhuh.
[1:54:16] I was waiting.
[1:54:18] Paul,
[1:54:20] Rebecca,
[1:54:22] Sarah, Joseph,
[1:54:25] tabernacle, the prophet was planning to
[1:54:28] leave
[1:54:29] and stay where he
[1:54:31] is. Those are love ones who have gone.
[1:54:35] If we could have an opportunity to speak
[1:54:37] to them and say come back, I tell you
[1:54:40] they're going to disappoint us.
[1:54:44] They they are feeling for you much more
[1:54:47] than you are feeling for them.
[1:54:52] Brother Brown did not want to come back.
[1:54:55] Ah say your time is you going to come
[1:54:57] back. Amen. So he came back with
[1:55:00] sadness.
[1:55:02] That was when he understood.
[1:55:05] What sister hope said, you only preached
[1:55:09] it. You've not experienced it.
[1:55:12] Hallelujah.
[1:55:14] Amen. So if we sorrow for the saints who
[1:55:16] are gone, is the sorrow of a momentary
[1:55:19] pattern.
[1:55:21] We didn't lose them.
[1:55:23] We're going to see them again.
[1:55:27] They die because they died in the hope
[1:55:31] of the coming grass.
[1:55:36] Listen,
[1:55:39] when the grave quake,
[1:55:43] the graves were opened. Amen. Amen.
[1:55:46] Amen. And when the graves were open,
[1:55:49] preparatory for what? Resurrection.
[1:55:52] Right. Yes. Jesus was buried.
[1:55:57] He had to be buried for them to come
[1:56:00] out.
[1:56:02] Ah, that is why the didn't come out on
[1:56:05] Good Friday. Amen.
[1:56:09] You didn't catch that. This is it. He
[1:56:12] has paid the price.
[1:56:15] I told you yesterday that he was both
[1:56:19] our lamp and our scapegoat. Yes. Amen.
[1:56:25] When a lamb or a goat is killed relative
[1:56:28] to sin. Yes. The blood of the
[1:56:33] dead, a goat or lamb is blessed upon
[1:56:38] another. Amen. Amen. is made and they
[1:56:42] will release that goat and he will run
[1:56:45] off far away into the wilderness
[1:56:49] which is a symbol of the death and the
[1:56:53] burial of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:56:58] the burial was necessary
[1:57:00] to take your sins
[1:57:03] having met the requirement to remit them
[1:57:07] he's going to take them far way into the
[1:57:11] se of God's forgetfulness. Hallelujah.
[1:57:15] It's not I told you yesterday, it's not
[1:57:17] just going to create a bridge over the
[1:57:20] is going to preach it. He's going to
[1:57:22] close it completely. Amen. He's going to
[1:57:25] justify those people. Amen. Who it
[1:57:28] couldn't enter into the holiest of the
[1:57:30] holies, whose faith was not perfected,
[1:57:35] whose experience stood at the middle C.
[1:57:39] Yes. It became their perfection. The
[1:57:42] real high priest. Did you catch that? So
[1:57:46] before they could come out, there must
[1:57:48] be a barrier.
[1:57:50] The sins must be taken far away into the
[1:57:54] sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:57:56] There were the sins who were taken far
[1:57:58] away.
[1:58:02] They were completely cleansed and
[1:58:03] separated
[1:58:05] right there. There was no more sin.
[1:58:08] We can apply the scripture of Romans 8
[1:58:11] to them now that now there is therefore
[1:58:14] now no condemnation
[1:58:16] [Applause]
[1:58:19] they receive their perfect justification
[1:58:24] by the burial of Christ
[1:58:27] after he took it away he became
[1:58:30] qualified
[1:58:32] to go and get the key
[1:58:35] hallelujah
[1:58:37] all This was happening on a day like
[1:58:39] this. He died on Friday. And he was
[1:58:43] buried, right? And they took it far
[1:58:46] away. On a day like this was his
[1:58:49] atonement. Amen. It was in the grave.
[1:58:52] But I tell you, it was only the body
[1:58:54] that was there. Yes.
[1:58:58] The Bible said his soul, yes, having met
[1:59:01] the penalty for sin and take blocks sin
[1:59:04] away from mankind, he became qualified
[1:59:08] to be the captain of the salvation of
[1:59:12] the past, the present and the future.
[1:59:18] Hallelujah. And he will address them one
[1:59:21] after the other. Amen. Amen. So you know
[1:59:25] what it did? It came into the fifth
[1:59:28] dimension.
[1:59:31] The fifth dimension has three layers.
[1:59:34] The first layer spirit of unjust men.
[1:59:39] Amen. When people die, their spirits
[1:59:42] don't die. Yes. You understand? Amen.
[1:59:46] That is why I said if you say somebody's
[1:59:49] an arm robber and you have given him a
[1:59:52] capital punishment,
[1:59:54] you are killing him. Yes. Maybe hanging
[1:59:57] or shooting him. You are only killing
[2:00:00] the victim of armed robber.
[2:00:04] You cannot kill an arm robber. Amen.
[2:00:13] Some of you don't get it.
[2:00:16] That arm robber is a spirit.
[2:00:20] It's a demon.
[2:00:21] [Music]
[2:00:23] Hallelujah. His victim is the body was
[2:00:26] using to express
[2:00:29] manifest. Amen.
[2:00:32] That is why back home in the days of
[2:00:35] capital punishment that don't exist
[2:00:36] anymore. When we very small boys when
[2:00:40] they have sentence some real robbers to
[2:00:43] death, they will take them to the
[2:00:45] Atlantic Ocean beach. You have your
[2:00:47] beach here, right? What's the name of
[2:00:49] that ocean? Indian Ocean. Indian Ocean.
[2:00:52] All right. They will take them to the
[2:00:53] Atlantic Ocean and man stakes and in
[2:00:57] their thoughts they are saying everybody
[2:00:59] should come and watch how not to end so
[2:01:02] that if you are stealing you must
[2:01:04] quickly change your mind. So they will
[2:01:08] pump rifle right in the presence of all.
[2:01:12] But guess what? As they were doing that
[2:01:15] somebody shouting my phone,
[2:01:17] my money. Who took it?
[2:01:25] right there. So what did we actually
[2:01:28] kill? Who did we kill?
[2:01:31] As that spirit was leaving that body, he
[2:01:34] jumped on another person and he started
[2:01:36] operation right there and there
[2:01:42] to show to the government you are
[2:01:44] wasting your time. You have only killed
[2:01:47] your citizen. You can't kill me. That's
[2:01:49] right. Amen.
[2:01:51] Amen. Yes. Are you catching that?
[2:01:56] So those spirits,
[2:01:58] they are the first layers in the fifth
[2:02:01] dimension.
[2:02:02] So today, that is why we pray with
[2:02:04] knowledge. Yes. You hear people say
[2:02:08] Satan die.
[2:02:11] Demons die. Die by fire. Not wasting
[2:02:14] your time.
[2:02:16] Some of you enjoy prayer like this.
[2:02:20] That's right.
[2:02:26] Amen.
[2:02:28] You can kill no demon. Now even demons
[2:02:31] know that their torment is in the
[2:02:32] future.
[2:02:34] You remember the men of Gary. They ask
[2:02:37] Jesus, why have you come to torment us
[2:02:38] before our time? We know we shall be
[2:02:41] tormented. But please wait till then.
[2:02:45] I didn't come to torment you. come to
[2:02:47] cast you out. So what the power we have
[2:02:50] is to do what? Cast. He said these
[2:02:53] things shall follow those that believe.
[2:02:55] In my name they shall do what?
[2:02:59] Amen.
[2:03:01] Hallelujah.
[2:03:04] So the Lord pierced through their realm.
[2:03:07] Amen. Amen.
[2:03:10] He pierced through the realm of demons.
[2:03:12] Then they went to the abboard of Satan.
[2:03:15] Yes. And I like this one
[2:03:19] the way the prophet dramatized it. Yes.
[2:03:22] He said when Jesus got to where Satan
[2:03:25] was, Satan was doing a thanksgiving.
[2:03:30] Amen. He said at last you are here. I
[2:03:35] thought I got you when I killed Isaiah.
[2:03:40] Amen. You will see the lesson I learned.
[2:03:43] God taught me from that. I thought I got
[2:03:45] you when I killed Jeremiah. When I
[2:03:48] killed this one, when I did this one, I
[2:03:49] thought I got you. But you are now here.
[2:03:53] Then I sat there one day was showing me
[2:03:55] something. He said, "Why did Satan
[2:03:58] mistook the identity of these
[2:04:01] personalities for Jesus?"
[2:04:04] It means even under the Old Testament
[2:04:06] dispensation,
[2:04:08] they live so well
[2:04:11] like Christ
[2:04:14] until the devil took them for grass.
[2:04:19] Hallelujah.
[2:04:21] So for me it's a great compliment.
[2:04:23] [Applause]
[2:04:25] If they could live so well like that,
[2:04:28] how much more hot we
[2:04:32] After we receive the power, hallelujah,
[2:04:36] the very life of him, not as an
[2:04:39] inspiration, but as a baptism, as a
[2:04:43] possession, hallelujah, our life will be
[2:04:45] greater.
[2:04:47] [Applause]
[2:04:51] Jesus said, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, keep
[2:04:53] quiet. Maybe if you have the time,
[2:04:57] you will give your testimony. But you
[2:05:00] see I am pressed for time because 72
[2:05:03] hours must not happen here. Everything I
[2:05:07] need to do must happen within 72 hours.
[2:05:12] Yes. And you are part of the deals.
[2:05:14] You're part of the project I need to fix
[2:05:18] after you. I have more things and I must
[2:05:21] do it in that range. So I don't have
[2:05:23] time for your testimony.
[2:05:26] [Music]
[2:05:28] The only reason I come here is to get
[2:05:30] the key.
[2:05:32] Hand me over. The keys of hell, the keys
[2:05:37] of death, the keys of grave. Hand it to
[2:05:41] me. See my blood up here. It's been
[2:05:44] accepted. You have no right to hold it
[2:05:48] any longer. Satan cannot keep agreement.
[2:05:52] So if you are going to get it, you got
[2:05:53] to get it by force.
[2:05:57] You've got to stand. You've got to be
[2:06:00] determined.
[2:06:02] You've got to be persistent.
[2:06:04] Hallelujah.
[2:06:06] And the prophet said Jesus gave him a
[2:06:09] deadly kick.
[2:06:12] Before he could recover,
[2:06:15] the king was gone.
[2:06:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:06:21] And Jesus left his realm. Hallelujah. He
[2:06:24] came to where those unrepentant people
[2:06:27] were.
[2:06:28] He said, "Look, the Bible said since the
[2:06:31] days of the long suffering of Noah, do
[2:06:34] you remember that souls that are in
[2:06:36] prison now,
[2:06:39] he came to them and said, I was the one
[2:06:41] that was preached to you that you
[2:06:44] rejected. I was the ark that Noah
[2:06:47] preached. Oh, we are ready to believe
[2:06:49] you. It's too late and it's going to be
[2:06:52] too late one of these days.
[2:06:55] If you are too sophisticated to accept
[2:06:57] it now, it's going to be too late for
[2:06:59] you one of these days. I give you that
[2:07:03] guarantee. If your class is too high to
[2:07:06] join the Holy Ghost band who says amen,
[2:07:09] who dress right, who live right, who
[2:07:12] don't cheat, who don't steal, who don't
[2:07:15] commit adultery, who don't live by
[2:07:17] fornication, who don't steal money,
[2:07:22] if that class is too simple for you, one
[2:07:25] of these days, you are going to come to
[2:07:28] your losses.
[2:07:30] You know what? Yes. The spirit of the
[2:07:33] Lord will be withdrawn shortly.
[2:07:38] And you and I are still here.
[2:07:41] [Music]
[2:07:42] And when that spirit of the Lord is
[2:07:44] withdrawn, he that is holy
[2:07:48] will be holy still. He that is filled
[2:07:52] will be filled this time.
[2:07:56] That's right. And the church will remain
[2:07:58] here for a while.
[2:08:01] Preaching to who? The eternal Lord.
[2:08:07] If we say nothing, our presence becomes
[2:08:10] the sermon
[2:08:12] to the eternal Lord. Because in that
[2:08:15] hour, nobody will be able to cross from
[2:08:18] one side to the other. It is over. Let
[2:08:22] me tell you the silent ark was the final
[2:08:25] message. Yes.
[2:08:28] Noah preached for 120 years. Yes. And
[2:08:31] the sermon brought in animals and ate
[2:08:34] souls. And the Lord shut the door for
[2:08:38] rain didn't fall immediately.
[2:08:41] A close silent hour became the final
[2:08:45] testimony to the eternal Lord is going
[2:08:49] to happen one of these days as it was in
[2:08:52] the days of Noah. As it was in the days
[2:08:55] of God, so shall it be.
[2:08:58] [Applause]
[2:09:03] While you can fix it, fix it now.
[2:09:07] Even if you have been aosted to the
[2:09:09] truth and God hasn't accounted as having
[2:09:13] blasphe, you can still fix it now.
[2:09:18] This is the time you and I have.
[2:09:21] Amen. We don't know what can happen
[2:09:22] tomorrow.
[2:09:27] He had to show to give a witness,
[2:09:30] brethren, that Noah was right and they
[2:09:34] were wrong. Isaiah was right. They were
[2:09:38] wrong. Jeremiah was right. They were
[2:09:41] wrong. Daniel was right. They were
[2:09:44] wrong. Hallelujah. After he finished
[2:09:47] with them, he changed dimensions. Amen.
[2:09:51] And they came to the paradise that then
[2:09:53] was because as I told you last night,
[2:09:57] even though those people died in the
[2:09:59] hope of the Lord, yet they were locked
[2:10:01] under the key Yes. of the devil, Satan,
[2:10:05] the author of death, them bound. Yes.
[2:10:09] Christ having broken the power of death
[2:10:12] by condemning and dealing with sin. Is
[2:10:15] God the authority to unlock death
[2:10:17] prisoners? Hallelujah. Then I can see
[2:10:20] him come to where Abraham was loved.
[2:10:25] [Music]
[2:10:25] [Applause]
[2:10:27] Who is that?
[2:10:30] I am the one who said I will visit you
[2:10:32] according to the time of life. I am
[2:10:36] here.
[2:10:40] Come see. Heaven is called you will
[2:10:45] return. I call you a pig. We are
[2:10:48] strangers. He is here.
[2:10:51] God told Abraham, "Come out quickly.
[2:10:53] Quickly. I have a job 72 hours." We
[2:10:57] shall have enough time to tell it.
[2:10:59] Just came out.
[2:11:05] Who is that? The wind in the middle of
[2:11:09] the wind.
[2:11:12] Lost.
[2:11:17] So did Jeremiah. So did Ezekiel. So did
[2:11:20] all of them. They all came out. And on
[2:11:24] the 10th day, hallelujah. They all
[2:11:27] resurrected with Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:11:32] This hope maketh not ashamed.
[2:11:35] Christ promises. He fulfilled his
[2:11:38] promise. The Bible said he rose with
[2:11:41] thousand times thousands. Yes, sir. Both
[2:11:43] the ones whose name you know and the
[2:11:45] ones whose names you don't know, they
[2:11:48] all resurrected.
[2:11:50] And they were appearing in Jerusalem
[2:11:53] looking, oh, this thing has changed over
[2:11:56] time.
[2:11:57] Can you can you do you remember that
[2:11:59] place we used to wonderful
[2:12:03] and they were just going like that? And
[2:12:05] they were around for like 40 days while
[2:12:08] Jesus was finishing up in his
[2:12:11] postresurrection ministry
[2:12:14] with the saints with the living saints.
[2:12:20] The resurrected saints were having a
[2:12:21] good time and the prophet said anytime
[2:12:24] somebody spot any of them they change
[2:12:27] places. Hallelujah.
[2:12:30] That is going to happen one more time.
[2:12:32] Amen.
[2:12:34] This is the good news I offer you.
[2:12:37] This is the good news I offer you. This
[2:12:40] shout message.
[2:12:42] This thought pool, this revealed word,
[2:12:44] the opening of the word is going to work
[2:12:46] upon the atoms of your body. Hallelujah.
[2:12:50] Until your life will come to a climax.
[2:12:53] And it will provoke resurrection.
[2:12:57] Did you hear me? Hallelujah. Amen. They
[2:13:00] are waiting on you and I. Yes.
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:03] [Applause]
[2:13:05] We are the one holding them down.
[2:13:09] When we come to that clearance and we
[2:13:12] are ready for the fullness of our
[2:13:13] adoption, which is your body change. Oh
[2:13:17] yes. Now the fullness of adoption.
[2:13:21] Our lives provoke resurrection.
[2:13:24] They will hear him loud and clear and
[2:13:27] come out of their graves. Amen.
[2:13:31] Their resurrection
[2:13:33] will produce our body change.
[2:13:36] Hallelujah. That is what the scripture
[2:13:38] said. He said we shall not prevent. The
[2:13:42] prophet said we shall not have a first
[2:13:44] advantage.
[2:13:46] Our life will provoke them coming up for
[2:13:48] it is their coming up that will break
[2:13:50] our own body change. And we shall be
[2:13:53] seen one and another.
[2:13:56] How long that is going to be? I don't
[2:13:58] know. But do you know what the prophet
[2:14:00] said? He said God will not wait for us
[2:14:02] to get to heaven before we know those
[2:14:05] who make it. He said we shall get right
[2:14:09] there.
[2:14:12] So one of these you see pastor
[2:14:16] just said thank God I made
[2:14:19] it. Francis and all those who have
[2:14:23] come up Joseph the rest of I don't know
[2:14:26] all their names but all the saints you
[2:14:28] have done just come up and say thank you
[2:14:31] Jesus
[2:14:33] because you won't see them if you are
[2:14:35] not connected with him
[2:14:38] that is why I said restoration and
[2:14:40] rapture has a location
[2:14:44] and the location is the message of the
[2:14:46] hour
[2:14:48] that is our own
[2:14:50] Outside of this message, no rapture.
[2:15:00] It is a hope that make no
[2:15:03] after about 40 days. I don't know how
[2:15:05] long is going to last between the
[2:15:08] resurrected and the living saints. I
[2:15:09] don't know how long it's going to last.
[2:15:11] Amen. So don't quote me and say brother
[2:15:13] did say 40 days. I don't know if it's
[2:15:16] going to be 40 or less. But I'm giving
[2:15:18] you a time in the scripture
[2:15:20] that was 40 days. Amen. And the prophet
[2:15:23] said we won't wait to get to heaven to
[2:15:25] know who made it. Said we go to see them
[2:15:28] right here. Get acquainted, shake hands,
[2:15:31] have good fellowship.
[2:15:34] That is our gathering together. That is
[2:15:36] a trumpet happening. And the climax of
[2:15:39] the trumpet is to do what? Take us for
[2:15:41] that sorrow.
[2:15:44] And so shall we ever be.
[2:15:47] with the Lord. Hallelujah. No more
[2:15:49] partying from that moment. Wedding
[2:15:52] supper together. Millennium together. We
[2:15:56] become wife. That is why we can be the
[2:15:58] wedding reception. We become wife. That
[2:16:01] is why we can spend millennial time with
[2:16:03] him.
[2:16:05] Who are the people who go to honeymoon
[2:16:07] together?
[2:16:08] Huh? You carry three or four people
[2:16:12] to my sister said, "No way. Only two.
[2:16:18] Hallelujah.
[2:16:19] For the church on earth will be the
[2:16:22] redeemed. Satan will be bound a thousand
[2:16:25] years and we will have no
[2:16:30] after that. King Jesus and his queen.
[2:16:33] She became queen because she's married.
[2:16:36] Hallelujah. They going to sit and judge
[2:16:39] the earth. The brother said the judgment
[2:16:41] is your own testimony. Amen. When
[2:16:43] somebody comes up and give excuse why he
[2:16:46] couldn't leave a body life in that door
[2:16:48] and that is so simp God will just look
[2:16:52] around and say queen
[2:16:58] come on heaven say something I live
[2:17:02] right in
[2:17:04] and to the glory of God I did this
[2:17:08] that's the judgment praise it's your
[2:17:12] against there.
[2:17:15] Hallelujah.
[2:17:18] And after that comes the punching of the
[2:17:21] earth, lake of fire that renovates the
[2:17:25] earth and prepare it for eternal living.
[2:17:28] Amen. The fire, the prophet said, is not
[2:17:33] just going to be all natural fire. Yes.
[2:17:36] Supernatural atomic. Yes. Will create a
[2:17:39] volcanic eruption. Yes. Around the
[2:17:41] center spread of the earth. Amen. And
[2:17:43] the period mountain will be pushed out.
[2:17:46] Yes. Right around Palestinian Canaan
[2:17:48] territory. But the city that John saw
[2:17:51] coming down to rest upon a physical
[2:17:55] city. Physical city.
[2:18:01] Friends. Only the bride who became wise.
[2:18:04] Yes. Only those message believers
[2:18:07] will live inside that city. the outest
[2:18:11] of every age.
[2:18:13] Those who will attach eternal life at
[2:18:15] the white throne judgment are going to
[2:18:18] populate around the city. Form nations
[2:18:21] and we put kings over them. Hallelujah.
[2:18:24] Hallelujah.
[2:18:26] And once in a cycle their kings will
[2:18:28] come. Yes. To pay tribute to King Jesus
[2:18:32] and his queen. Amen. And when they are
[2:18:35] leaving, we shall tell them proclaim me
[2:18:37] from the tree of life as a sovereign to
[2:18:40] show to the people that once upon a time
[2:18:43] we have wars, chaos and commotions,
[2:18:46] sanctions and so forth. But in this
[2:18:48] economy, none of it's eternal peace,
[2:18:52] joy, and blessings of the almighty God.
[2:18:56] What a wonderful time that will be
[2:18:58] friends. That is the Easter that Christ
[2:19:01] has given you and her. When Christ
[2:19:04] finished his post resurrection ministry,
[2:19:07] he was ready to leave. Amen. It was
[2:19:11] Jesus many s but thousands of saints
[2:19:14] like
[2:19:16] were flying with him to glory. And King
[2:19:19] David pictured them when they got to the
[2:19:22] porters of glory. Amen. They were the
[2:19:24] ones singing lift up ye gates
[2:19:29] and open for the king of glory. for God
[2:19:33] is and the potters of heaven said, "Who
[2:19:37] is this king of glory? Those who have
[2:19:40] tasted his power, those who have
[2:19:42] experienced his redemption, they were
[2:19:45] the one that answered back, not even
[2:19:47] Jesus." They said, "The Lord mighty in
[2:19:51] battle. He is the king of glory." One of
[2:19:55] these there will be another amage mar up
[2:19:59] to glory one more time. and we shall
