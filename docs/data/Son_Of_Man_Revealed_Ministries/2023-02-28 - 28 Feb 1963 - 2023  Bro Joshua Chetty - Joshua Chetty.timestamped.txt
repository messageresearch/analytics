[0:00] damn psycho amen when was this picture
[0:03] taken on the 28th of February
[0:07] a what magazine packed it up Life
[0:10] Magazine amen you think all these things
[0:12] are coincidence
[0:14] and this was the seven seal amen
[0:18] go and type search seven seal on your
[0:21] search and see how many time it appears
[0:23] there 63 times
[0:25] is it coincidence in 1963
[0:28] hey
[0:31] so all these things was happening but
[0:33] the seven angel had to be on the scene
[0:36] God could have revealed it in fourth
[0:38] time Paul was seeing all these Mysteries
[0:40] you are seeing all these great things
[0:42] but it wasn't lawful for him to speak at
[0:44] that time
[0:46] and everything Paul spoke was in mystery
[0:48] form
[0:49] but now it's coming things are going to
[0:51] be revealed plainly
[0:52] but is it for the whole world
[0:56] in the lives
[0:59] you say like Romeo come and take away
[1:01] Juliet
[1:03] amen since he's talking about his
[1:05] mysterious coming amen
[1:08] the cycle of his coming the process of
[1:11] his coming how he's gonna come and the
[1:13] process inuchi will come is a mystery
[1:16] secrets
[1:17] without a public show yes amen amen this
[1:20] thing is revealed to a special class of
[1:22] people
[1:24] a people that will come into an
[1:25] invisible Union amen
[1:30] before we go there let's read the
[1:31] scripture
[1:32] we read Exodus 23 20.
[1:36] I want you to understand the
[1:38] significance of all these things that
[1:39] you see how the Lord was leading out the
[1:41] spirit is leading he took us to all this
[1:43] process of all these teachings
[1:46] thank you
[1:50] but in Revelation 10 1 let's look at
[1:52] Luke
[1:53] The Book of Luke chapter 21
[1:56] verse 27-28
[2:00] 27 says
[2:02] and then shall they see the son of man
[2:04] coming in a cloud
[2:06] with power and great
[2:09] Glory
[2:11] 28 says and when these things begin to
[2:15] come to pass
[2:16] then look up and lift up your heads for
[2:20] your Redemption draw it lie amen now
[2:25] these things took place
[2:27] let's see what Peter is saying you know
[2:31] in second Peter chapter three
[2:37] [Music]
[2:47] second Peter chapter 3 saying the second
[2:49] Apostle beloved I now write unto you in
[2:52] both which I stir up your pure Minds by
[2:55] way of remembrance
[2:57] that Jay may be mindful of the word
[2:59] which was spoken before by the only
[3:01] Prophets and of the Commandment of us
[3:04] the Apostle of the law of the Lord and
[3:06] savior
[3:07] knowing this first that there shall come
[3:11] in the last days coffers
[3:14] working after their own
[3:18] and saying where is the promise of his
[3:21] coming
[3:23] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[3:25] things continue as they wake up the
[3:28] beginning of the creation for this day
[3:32] willingly are ignorant of their by the
[3:35] word of God the heavens way of old and
[3:37] the Earth standing out of the water and
[3:39] in the water
[3:40] whereby the world that was there that
[3:44] then was being overflowed water perished
[3:48] but the heavens and the Earth which are
[3:50] now by the same word are kept in store
[3:52] reserved unto fire against the day of
[3:56] judgment and Petition of ungodly men
[4:00] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[4:04] thing that one day is what the Lord is
[4:06] in Thousand Years and a thousand years
[4:09] at one day amen amen
[4:12] now
[4:13] if you look at nine you say the Lord is
[4:15] not slack concerning his promise as some
[4:19] men conflictness in some some people
[4:22] got impatient
[4:24] and they're asking where is the promise
[4:25] of his coming
[4:27] but the reason why they're impatient
[4:29] because it wasn't revealed to them
[4:32] the mystery of and the process of his
[4:35] coming was not revealed to them
[4:37] and they have been coming to a union
[4:39] with him yes you see
[4:41] Christ is not going to marry someone he
[4:43] doesn't know he doesn't have a
[4:45] relationship with it amen he must know
[4:48] you you understand you must come into a
[4:50] union with him you must come into a
[4:53] relationship with him amen and if you if
[4:56] you come to a relationship within you
[4:57] you begin to understand his nature
[5:02] in his presence
[5:06] nature you understand the thing that he
[5:08] loves and you want to commune with him
[5:11] yeah we spoke on the series on prayer
[5:14] the prayer is not the easiest thing to
[5:17] do but when you love him and you want to
[5:19] talk to him you want to communicate with
[5:22] him amen you want to spend time in his
[5:26] presence amen amen whether it's reading
[5:28] his word whether it's fellowshiping
[5:30] around his word whether he's listening
[5:31] to a sermon you'll want to spend time in
[5:34] his presence thank you
[5:38] but it says
[5:40] so these people are impatient that's why
[5:42] you find people love sort of slandering
[5:44] the message
[5:47] picking in false and everything
[5:49] because why are they trying to
[5:51] understand this they want to satisfy
[5:53] their own lust In the Flesh when I run
[5:55] away from this word and go and satisfy
[5:58] the fleshly lust
[6:00] but the Lord is not slack amen
[6:02] concerning his promise and some men
[6:05] count slackness and I don't think the
[6:07] Lord is wrecked you can see the way the
[6:09] Lord is working yes the Lord is working
[6:11] with individual he's shaping and he's
[6:13] mowing individuals amen amen so that he
[6:16] came rightly fit into the body amen if
[6:19] they can be positionally placed into
[6:21] what he's called them for and when they
[6:23] are placed into the place that they they
[6:25] have been called then they can be used
[6:27] in the body amen amen that's why he's
[6:30] Communists I want to give us skill and
[6:32] understanding
[6:34] there was the age where you can say the
[6:36] people who don't know where they were
[6:38] going but in this age the mind of Christ
[6:40] has come down amen amen Airship has come
[6:43] down to lead the body yes amen
[6:48] but his long-suffering to us towards us
[6:51] not willing that any should perish but
[6:55] that all should come to repentance amen
[6:57] now
[6:58] you might look at the scripture and say
[7:01] why is this long suffering maybe there's
[7:03] more to come in what if it's not people
[7:07] from the outside but these people are
[7:08] already inside
[7:10] God wants us to truly repent amen God
[7:13] wants us to come to the knowledge of the
[7:15] church to come to receive the baptism of
[7:18] the Holy Ghost to walk into your
[7:20] inheritance amen like we read the book
[7:23] of Joshua chapter 18 how long will you
[7:25] be slacked to receive your inheritance
[7:28] concerning your inheritance
[7:33] so maybe long-suffing that we all come
[7:35] into our rightful positions amen
[7:39] not willing that any should perish but
[7:42] that all should come to repentance
[7:45] but the day of the Lord will come and
[7:48] the nights in the which the heaven shall
[7:50] pass away with a great noise any element
[7:52] shall melt with further needs he heard
[7:55] also when your works there are therein
[7:57] shall be burnt up
[7:58] seeing there that all you think shall be
[8:00] dissolved what manner of persons
[8:03] or J to be in all since coming back to
[8:07] the individual law it's all only
[8:09] conversation and godliness amen looking
[8:12] for listing unto the coming of the day
[8:14] of God die if this process hasn't been
[8:17] revealed to you
[8:18] because he said when you see these
[8:20] things look up your Redemption draw it
[8:22] nice so if you haven't seen this thing
[8:23] how would you be looking for the coming
[8:25] of the Lord
[8:27] I'm talking about the time when you come
[8:29] and take us away amen wearing the
[8:31] heavens
[8:33] Heavens resolved and the element shall
[8:35] melt
[8:38] with promise look for new events
[8:40] wearing Duality righteousness yes amen
[8:45] amen
[8:47] so you find that
[8:52] people are still looking at this mystery
[8:54] people and even in this day
[8:57] they still want to just leave out to say
[8:58] no just okay it's an event we believe
[9:00] the events
[9:02] but if you can't see that event in the
[9:03] scripture
[9:05] amen if you can't take what the property
[9:08] is saying and your property win and take
[9:10] it back to scripture
[9:11] then you can't recognize what's
[9:13] happening then you say no okay the
[9:15] prophet because the prophet said if we
[9:17] believe it
[9:18] but you've got to recognize who is here
[9:20] amongst us amen
[9:22] who came and United with us yes it was a
[9:25] mighty God unveiled before us amen
[9:29] a mighty God come to awaken us
[9:32] seven Thunders come to awaken us
[9:36] he comes to give us rapturing Faith he
[9:38] comes he come to show us our true
[9:40] identification
[9:45] thank you
[9:48] [Music]
[9:50] let's look at a few things that the
[9:51] properties saying about this event amen
[10:01] you know we spoke about that you read
[10:03] the scripture about long-suffering
[10:06] the church age in Ephesus was from 53 to
[10:09] 170 from 80 53 to 80 170.
[10:14] which equals 117 years
[10:18] for 1906 to 2023
[10:23] he's actually 117 years
[10:28] so it's the same amount of years that
[10:30] was the shortest age
[10:35] so is this Tower the Lord is molding out
[10:37] the champion amen
[10:39] getting us ready to depart yes
[10:41] taking away everything that will keep us
[10:43] outbound amen taking out taking away
[10:46] everything from the flesh that is
[10:48] keeping us away from his presence
[10:50] because he wants you want us to separate
[10:52] from the tunnel nature if you want to
[10:55] experience God the presence of God in
[10:58] your life you're going to be separated
[10:59] from the heart of nature
[11:03] and that's what happened in this hour
[11:04] people didn't understand the peering of
[11:07] the Lord
[11:08] which are the mighty Angel clothed in
[11:10] the cloud
[11:12] amen
[11:13] and people didn't understand that they
[11:16] just saw this cloud
[11:19] now it was just some phenomenal cloud
[11:22] how could why would it be don't you
[11:25] think it'd be coincidental where the
[11:26] Lord will say the proprietary to the
[11:28] rights you'll speak to him now when you
[11:30] turn it to the right you can see it
[11:31] clearly amen
[11:34] thank you
[11:36] and it's very Prophet before that a year
[11:39] before that a few months before that
[11:41] he's telling you exactly what Vision he
[11:43] had
[11:44] and what what's the case taking he's
[11:46] taking revelation 10-1
[11:48] amen amen
[11:51] he's taking that scripture because he's
[11:52] a scriptural prophet he must take you
[11:55] back to the scripture
[11:56] [Music]
[12:00] and he's and he's pointing this out in
[12:02] scripture he's not just showing you an
[12:03] event that happened
[12:05] he's taking you to scripture yes and the
[12:07] scripture and this prophet had the same
[12:10] color of fire that followed him
[12:12] must have a cloud because he had part of
[12:15] Moses Ministry amen amen he had to pull
[12:18] off fire which is God appearing in the
[12:20] pillar of fire god might also be in a
[12:21] cloud
[12:23] that's how he revealed himself amen so
[12:26] the child appeared is not something new
[12:28] it's something that was there
[12:30] it also came to the children of Israel
[12:32] amen right yes
[12:37] and he comes to reveal to us all these
[12:39] machines that are locked up in the Book
[12:40] of Daniel in the Book of Revelation
[12:42] which was there in simple form
[12:45] amen
[12:46] he comes to make this thing flame to us
[12:48] amen
[12:51] that's why it says in the days of the
[12:53] voice of the seven danger when it shall
[12:55] begin to sound the mystery will be
[12:57] finish
[13:07] the prophet says one day standing there
[13:10] picking the cockle bird off or Little
[13:13] Bull headers off my legs like it was
[13:17] that there's seven angels broke through
[13:19] from the sky and shook the place
[13:22] amen
[13:24] they come from eternity amen
[13:27] so rocks weighing 50
[13:29] pounds rolled down the hillside
[13:33] they stood Seven Angels standing there
[13:35] commissioned me go back to bring these
[13:39] Messengers messages
[13:41] and said one by one they would meet and
[13:44] tell what happened
[13:48] and it did exactly that way
[13:52] and when they ascended up an eye like
[13:54] that went 30 miles high there and in the
[13:57] same day they took the picture of it
[13:59] science did it and went around the world
[14:02] it's a paradox
[14:03] but it was an absolute he tied me Taija
[14:07] into Jesus Christ winding my life into
[14:09] him I know it seems strange it always
[14:12] because what was that
[14:15] but he was waiting all his life for a
[14:17] message amen amen and what was the
[14:21] message was Christ amen this is what is
[14:24] record you can see Christ in every book
[14:26] of the Bible you see Christ throughout
[14:28] the Bible he is the principal team of
[14:30] the Bible amen he is the mystery of
[14:33] God's revealed amen
[14:36] in a message absolutely sing that
[14:38] in a message try to do God's service
[14:41] without being the will of God
[14:43] he says
[14:45] their Mysteries will be revealed in the
[14:47] last days when the seven angels message
[14:51] not when he stands out doing this but
[14:54] when he begins to sound is
[14:56] message
[14:59] not the years in preparation now not the
[15:01] first two pools
[15:03] but when he begins to
[15:05] sound is message
[15:09] these Mysteries then will be revealed
[15:12] and here they are not knowing them and
[15:15] you people are a witness of deaths
[15:17] and then in that great Observatory
[15:21] so that the world will be without they
[15:23] still wondering what happened
[15:27] in Tucson then big observatories took
[15:29] the picture of it up there still
[15:31] wondering what happened
[15:39] ask people to bring in all the evidence
[15:42] all the pictures and he began to study
[15:44] it and he still couldn't understand it
[15:47] when he was approached about it carry
[15:50] green and so forth
[15:52] he told them you're like full of
[15:53] superstition
[15:55] and you know what happened to him he
[15:57] ended up committing suicide
[16:03] they still put it in the paper does
[16:04] anybody know anything about what how it
[16:07] could have happened
[16:09] there is no fog up there there's no air
[16:11] there's no moisture 30 miles up in the
[16:13] air
[16:14] it shall be signed in the heaven above
[16:17] amen when God is doing something you
[16:19] must show his signs in the heaven above
[16:21] first
[16:23] and when these things take place see now
[16:26] when he showed the signs what happened
[16:27] is that when the science earthquakes in
[16:28] diverse places you know what happened
[16:30] after this
[16:33] the next incident
[16:35] judgment struck the West Coast
[16:39] and he didn't stop from there we had an
[16:41] Earthquakes for an Earthquakes we had
[16:43] pestilences we're having all this
[16:45] amateur tribulations upon the Earth
[16:51] then shall appear the sign in the heaven
[16:53] the son of man amen that day Luke the
[16:56] son of man would reveal himself again
[16:58] and the world looked like Thunderman
[17:00] tomorrow oh my
[17:02] now let's go back to Sodom and gomorro
[17:04] what happened there before the
[17:06] destruction of Sodom and gomorro he
[17:08] appears to Abraham amen amen
[17:13] gives them a name change amen
[17:16] amen and reveal discern The Secret of
[17:19] Sarah's Hearts all right
[17:23] but before he leaves Abraham and he and
[17:26] remember because
[17:28] after that they can have a body change
[17:30] but before he leaves Abraham is gonna
[17:33] reveal to April his judgment now upon
[17:36] Saddam and tomorrow
[17:39] amen but before even he's gonna
[17:42] pronounce judgment but he's also going
[17:44] to go sin he's investigating angels amen
[17:47] and that's why we got all these
[17:48] unidentified flying objects
[17:51] they don't realize what it is they're
[17:53] investigating angels to come in and why
[17:55] so much now in the day when he's like
[17:57] Sodom again
[17:59] it goes to come and investigate the
[18:01] condition that's here
[18:04] and he's telling Abraham what he's going
[18:06] to do
[18:07] there's a spirit of Christ steps in
[18:08] Abraham
[18:10] what he does is he is convinced now
[18:13] there's going to be a destruction
[18:15] because Abraham know who this is because
[18:17] he's seeing Three Angels but he's saying
[18:19] my Lord
[18:21] amen
[18:26] we see there were seven angels that
[18:28] formed the top but we know we say my
[18:30] Lord
[18:31] amen we know it's a mighty Angel amen
[18:38] the seven spirits of God from his throne
[18:40] come up and make up the mighty angel of
[18:42] God Amen
[18:46] we find that Abraham is saying my Lord
[18:49] and then he tells Ibraham this is what
[18:52] I'm going to do to sort of in tomorrow
[18:54] and Abraham immediately starts to plead
[18:58] watch now
[19:01] this is the spirit of Christ because
[19:03] he's pleading now
[19:04] he wants his family to save
[19:06] and he's asking Lord a 50-day will you
[19:08] say no then he's barking
[19:12] Abraham is bargaining with God
[19:16] not that same
[19:18] the same experience
[19:22] really believing that the destruction
[19:24] coming upon the Earth
[19:25] [Music]
[19:30] and if the world is in a certain
[19:32] condition he's going to destroy the
[19:34] Earth even as Peter said the elements of
[19:36] the Earth is going to burn up
[19:38] with fire
[19:41] I'm your father but our family is to be
[19:44] saved our loved wants to be saved how
[19:47] many of us can see the day approaching
[19:48] amen so he's bugged me with God
[19:51] but Abraham is nowhere near the
[19:53] destruction
[19:57] whether the destruction is taking place
[20:00] but he goes there
[20:02] and then the Angels going to Solomon you
[20:04] learn the story from there
[20:05] [Music]
[20:07] but what happened after that is a body
[20:09] change amen amen
[20:13] right in the time
[20:15] of judgment the pronunciation of
[20:16] judgment
[20:17] when he goes when the Angels go down
[20:19] there there's a body chain foreign
[20:27] that day they took
[20:29] all across Southern United States and
[20:31] Mexico a day and now in Life Magazine
[20:33] still I must speak to them but he
[20:36] declares it in the heaven before he does
[20:37] it on Earth he always does that he shows
[20:41] his signs in the heavens persons
[20:50] another code he says return home for
[20:53] thus say the Lord
[20:55] this is what the Lord was saying
[20:59] the seven mystery that's been hid in the
[21:02] Bible all these years
[21:03] his denominations and everything God is
[21:06] going to open your seven Mysteries to us
[21:08] in the seventh seals
[21:11] there was that Circle coming up from the
[21:13] earth like a Mist forming when he did
[21:16] it went Plum up into the mountain being
[21:18] a circle on Westward from the way it
[21:21] come sign is founded after a while 30
[21:24] miles die and 25 miles across it really
[21:27] amazing smile just exactly in the circle
[21:29] of the pyramid
[21:31] and the other day standing there turned
[21:34] the picture to the right
[21:36] here's it now
[21:38] he turned the picture to the right and
[21:40] there is Jesus
[21:42] as he was in the seven Church ages amen
[21:45] the white big one showing Supreme deity
[21:48] is Alpha and Omega is the first and the
[21:51] last
[21:52] now how many of you all took the picture
[21:54] and showed it to your friend your family
[21:59] or anybody with a message wasn't the
[22:01] real friend said can you see Christ
[22:04] was they really taken by that
[22:07] it's not for everybody you can show them
[22:10] you're showing them a picture right
[22:11] using the image there yeah
[22:16] today is just a picture
[22:17] [Music]
[22:19] to you is a reality amen not just
[22:22] because of a picture amen because he
[22:25] wasn't even there when the prophet was
[22:26] there he wasn't there when the picture
[22:27] was taken how come you believe it
[22:31] because you are having a relationship

[32:25] with a bride amen
[32:29] their Christ will be formed in this many

[32:41] that's where the scripture said be not
[32:44] conform any longer to the pattern of
[32:46] this world
[32:48] of this world
[32:50] but be transformed by the renewing of
[32:53] your mind because now the mind of Christ
[32:56] has come down and show you another world
[32:59] all you brought of good was this world
[33:01] all your life you learned about things
[33:04] in this world yes you learn about how to
[33:06] survive in this world
[33:08] right
[33:09] but what you didn't realize
[33:11] that while he was living in a scientific
[33:13] world it was influenced by Satan
[33:17] it was influenced by demon power
[33:20] amen From Another World this Dimension
[33:23] was being influenced
[33:25] but just like that he comes from another
[33:27] world
[33:28] Amen to give us skill and understanding
[33:30] he comes from another world with seven
[33:33] Thunders to awaken us
[33:35] out of that spiritual Amnesia where we
[33:38] didn't realize that we really come from
[33:40] God
[33:41] we didn't realize that we are
[33:43] supernatural beings trapped in a flesh
[33:46] body
[33:47] we didn't realize that we bypassed our
[33:49] theophany
[33:50] but now when we come to this full
[33:52] realization amen when we come to the
[33:54] spiritual realization it brings us into
[33:57] such a faith amen that one of these days
[34:00] amen from this natural we're gonna go

[34:16] amen amen you might be looking like a
[34:18] person like every other human being in
[34:20] this flesh body but you are tapping into
[34:22] the supernatural because why this was a
[34:25] supernatural message there was a
[34:27] supernatural event that took place in
[34:30] 1963.
[34:32] it wasn't just
[34:34] a scientific thing that the way science

[34:39] to do with the atmosphere or anything it
[34:42] was a supernatural event

[35:54] my angel before thee to keep me in the
[35:56] way and to bring thee in the place which
[35:59] I have prepared

[36:03] taking us on his Exodus journey and he's
[36:06] taking us to the place that he's
[36:07] prepared for us
[36:10] he said Beware of him that that means
[36:14] you need to be sensitive
[36:16] amen be sensitive to when he's speaking
[36:19] to you
[36:20] sensitive in the way he's working amen
[36:22] and obey his voice

[36:30] here amen provoke him nuts
[36:33] the Bible said believe not the holy
[36:35] spirit of God whereby he has sealed
[36:38] until the day off Redemption amen
[36:41] how are we provoking how are we
[36:43] provoking
[36:45] God did not give us a filthy Spirit by
[36:47] the Holy Spirit
[36:49] things that he will take away his flight
[36:51] provoking nuts
[36:53] you know the things that the Holy Spirit
[36:55] wouldn't entertain
[36:57] the things that you wouldn't the places
[36:59] that you wouldn't want to be around the
[37:01] atmosphere that you wouldn't want to be
[37:02] around provoke him not
[37:05] out of the children of Israel provoke
[37:07] him there was murmuring you heard the
[37:10] message the other day they will keep
[37:11] murmuring
[37:15] don't go like complaining grounding and
[37:17] be grateful for what he has done for us
[37:20] amen thank the Lord for what he's done
[37:22] for US
[37:23] 60 years now and from where he's taking
[37:26] this message
[37:27] sorry the progression in this message
[37:30] you can see the progression now in a
[37:32] message for this past 60 years
[37:36] nothing is stagnant in the world Amen
[37:38] this message never denominates
[37:41] but it was a continuous work of the Holy
[37:44] Ghost amen
[37:47] and as each he generally as each age or
[37:51] each year past God revealed what was
[37:54] what was needed for that hour
[37:59] and as it's progressing more God will
[38:02] reveal more and more amen
[38:06] [Music]
[38:07] amen even though the worker for marriage
[38:09] would be stagnated by now yes one is a
[38:12] progression amen
[38:16] he said Beware of female obey his voice
[38:19] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[38:22] your transgression my name is in him
[38:27] amen
[38:29] so he said so give us clear
[38:31] understanding but I love this party
[38:33] everybody says for my angel shall go
[38:36] before thee and bring thee unto the
[38:38] amorites and the hitchhikes and the
[38:39] parasites and the Canaanites and their
[38:41] invites and the Jeopardy said I will cut
[38:43] them off
[38:44] amen nothing is going to stand before if
[38:47] you are just obeying his voice and the
[38:49] angel of God is going before you nothing
[38:51] is going to stand before you and your
[38:52] inhabitants amen amen of everything that
[38:56] will enter your inhabitants
[38:58] imagine you're walking along this
[39:00] journey amen how are you walking along
[39:02] your land of inevitance and you obeying
[39:05] his voice and you are sensitive to his
[39:07] leading then nothing is going to stand
[39:09] in your way amen
[39:11] amen
[39:12] that's why he's anointed us for this
[39:14] hour in every age he's given an
[39:15] anointing that's why there was 68
[39:18] million could be mattered that's why
[39:19] Louis aged he could say the Justice
[39:22] Angel could believe in sanctification
[39:24] and you come in the age of anointed to
[39:26] Fly Above All This demon power there's
[39:29] 200 million demons looking around amen
[39:33] you can sew above because you're
[39:35] anointed amen for the hour
[39:40] amen so what was that mystery
[39:44] amen the mystery was Christ and his
[39:48] bride amen the mystery was for a union
[39:51] between Christ and his bride because the
[39:54] head has come to tough tail with the
[39:57] body amen The Headstone has come down to
[40:01] cap the body to be the perfect pyramid
[40:03] amen
[40:07] something that wasn't done in any other
[40:09] age but it's coming this day so this is
[40:12] the age where there is no excuse
[40:15] there is no excuse about understanding
[40:17] the word of God because this is the age
[40:20] where the mind of Christ has
[40:22] include his age to be ignorant of this
[40:25] thing in Wesley's age it was ignorant of
[40:27] these things

[40:45] and reveal all his mystery truths
[40:48] but yet the people are still scorning at
[40:49] it
[40:51] amen
[41:04] says
[41:19] he said now this message of Malachi for
[41:22] and Revelation 10 7 is going you know
[41:24] the coach he's going to do two things
[41:27] one according to Malachi 4 he will turn
[41:30] the heart of the children to the fathers
[41:32] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[41:35] seven thunders in Revelation 10. which
[41:37] are the revelations contained in the
[41:39] Seven Seals
[41:41] it will be these divinely revealed
[41:44] Mysteries
[41:45] trips and literally turned the heart of
[41:47] the children to the Pentecostal father
[41:49] amen now
[41:52] those that are not identifying the cloud
[41:54] with revelation 10.
[41:57] and just looking at okay maybe it was a
[41:59] supernatural event and uh William
[42:01] Brenner
[42:03] and did that identify in the description
[42:04] how are these Mysteries
[42:07] if they miss the one that come in this
[42:09] hour
[42:12] amen
[42:13] because one appeared to the prophet in
[42:15] this hour he said the one I've been
[42:17] waiting for all my life amen I've been
[42:19] waiting for the message the notable one
[42:21] amen
[42:22] I've been waiting for this all my life
[42:24] because he's waiting for the gift all
[42:25] his life
[42:28] you're waiting for Christ to come make
[42:31] himself alone
[42:35] he knew that this
[42:39] wasn't ordinary amen he wasn't an
[42:41] ordinary event that's why he said this
[42:42] was the most it was the most
[42:44] Supernatural event in his life apart
[42:46] from all the Medicals and everything
[42:48] that took place
[42:50] this wasn't an ordinary event
[42:55] but now you the ones that are rejecting
[42:59] or they can't see that but the scripture
[43:01] how are these mystery truths gonna be
[43:04] revealed to them
[43:06] amen
[43:08] he said realizing that our time is
[43:10] limited here especially for those
[43:12] friends who are listening in my
[43:13] telephone I would like to call your
[43:14] attention this morning a picture that
[43:16] some time ago was taken about the camera
[43:18] of the vision that I had here at the
[43:21] Tabernacle of living Indiana to Arizona
[43:23] where I was to meet in the form of a
[43:26] permanent seven angels not knowing what
[43:28] would happen later when I got there
[43:31] thinking it was the end of my life that
[43:33] no one could stand the blast and I'm
[43:35] sure all of you are acquainted with the
[43:37] story
[43:38] and then in Sabino Canyon one morning
[43:40] like this one in prayer there has been a
[43:43] sword placed in my head and said this is
[43:46] the word and the sword of the word
[43:48] later the angel appeared as was
[43:50] prophesied
[43:51] you know the story we said teaching
[43:53] sword yes yes amen yes
[43:56] which was going to be the worst
[43:58] later the Angels appeared as was
[44:00] prophesied and at the same time a great
[44:03] cluster of light left where I was
[44:05] standing and moved 30 miles high in the
[44:07] air around the surface like wings of the
[44:09] angels and drawed into the skies a shape
[44:12] of a pyramids in the same constellation
[44:15] of angels that appeared
[44:17] time took the picture all the way from
[44:19] Mexico when it moved from northern
[44:20] Arizona where the holy spirit said I was
[44:23] standing will be standing 40 miles
[44:25] Northeast of Tucson and he went into the
[44:27] air and a Life magazine in fact the
[44:29] teacher in you must take something away
[44:31] in the spears whether where there could
[44:33] be no moisture where there could be no
[44:35] evaporation or anything 30 miles high
[44:37] and 27 miles across and coming up from
[44:41] where those angels were
[44:43] now they asked to know
[44:46] now they asked to know signs to one of
[44:48] them in Tucson wants to know any
[44:50] significance but I didn't tell them
[44:55] you all know knew it it's all performed
[44:57] but it wasn't for them it was for you
[44:59] amen amen you see it wasn't for
[45:03] everybody
[45:04] [Music]
[45:09] the Rapture is not a public show
[45:13] the Rapture is not for the whole world
[45:14] to know
[45:17] it's a secret
[45:19] this is for Christ and his bride
[45:21] this is a secret catching away
[45:24] this was an invisible Union
[45:26] it wasn't for the whole world the world
[45:28] is thinking
[45:29] things are still the same so the father
[45:31] fell asleep offers that began to rise up
[45:33] while there was coughing there was a
[45:37] union taking place
[45:40] [Music]
[45:43] your name
[45:49] I knew you not
[45:53] there was no Union
[45:56] what is the evidence of the Union there
[45:59] must be Christ reproduced again
[46:02] you cannot hide
[46:04] a mother that is that expecting a child
[46:06] cannot hide at a certain season right
[46:10] there comes the time when she cannot
[46:11] hide the pregnancy amen
[46:14] oh there was a time when you started to
[46:16] rejoice and you started to see those
[46:18] things you started to Bubble Up amen
[46:21] he started to Glow amen
[46:23] but Christ must be reproduced again amen
[46:28] amen because why let's see that was in
[46:31] there amen and now when it comes to food
[46:33] bearing time we had to bring forth a
[46:35] fruit of his kind
[46:38] the denomination plus they Siege they
[46:40] had they saw us with the Branham went
[46:43] and he was a plunder too amen and he saw
[46:45] his seed in his time but in a time when
[46:48] it came for food bearing time amen
[46:50] whatever seed was there the fruits are
[46:53] showing now you can't hide fruits
[46:57] all these years
[46:59] but it was X there was an exit out of
[47:01] the message
[47:02] Because by the fruit you shall know that
[47:04] amen amen
[47:07] because they had to be gathered up and
[47:09] we have to be together
[47:12] now
[47:15] he said
[47:17] he didn't tell them it wasn't for you it
[47:19] was for you so you see for a special
[47:21] class of people
[47:23] and so there he spoke to me and said
[47:25] seven of seals will be opened the seven
[47:28] Mysteries seven four mystery of the
[47:30] Bible have been closed up since the
[47:32] foundation of the world will be revealed
[47:34] and yet a humble little group compared
[47:36] with all the world we've enjoyed is
[47:37] blessing the hearing this mystery manage
[47:40] divorce certain seed in all these
[47:41] different questions has been completely
[47:43] revealed to us
[47:45] not by man but by God himself yet opened
[47:49] those seven mysteries of what the church
[47:50] was how it was in Christ in the
[47:53] beginning and how it will be reveal in
[47:55] the last days and now as this went up we
[47:57] have the picture outside on the plot but
[47:59] then I have the picture laying fears in
[48:01] jail if you notice that live magazine
[48:02] had it but I wonder if my audience
[48:04] visible here has ever really looked at
[48:06] the picture
[48:07] see in the way it should be
[48:11] you remember I was preaching when the
[48:13] vision came upon the subject of the Book
[48:15] of Revelation when the old judges
[48:17] where we see in Jesus in Revelation when
[48:20] we started out
[48:21] to the Seven Seas of the church it is
[48:23] rather just prior to the opening of the
[48:25] seventh seal Christ was telling would
[48:27] hear like the world now you know what
[48:29] he's talking about today
[48:30] spoke about him coming as the judge you
[48:33] know to the whole English judges he came
[48:35] as Supreme deity
[48:37] what he's trying to say there now
[48:39] to us it's revealed right and to those
[48:42] that is not revealed and though to those
[48:44] that rejected it
[48:46] and and what is dangerous in this our
[48:48] people have blasphemed
[48:50] they made a mockery of it
[48:53] they made a mockery of Israel
[48:57] today now he is also there as a judge
[48:59] together

[55:08] had and whatever skill god-given skill
[55:11] God has given them each one used a skill
[55:14] and became successful in their skill and
[55:17] they became fruitful in that land that

[55:24] nations around him

[56:46] because of the significance of the day
[56:48] today to add a special
[56:50] but I don't believe anything has been
[56:52] stagnant amen I believe it's a

[57:12] late from 1906 to 2023 we have reached
[57:15] 117 years
[57:20] so and if you look at the way the Lord
[57:23] has been dealing with us
[57:25] trying to shape us trying to mold us try
[57:28] to
[57:29] get us remember
[57:32] for Samson to have been infected in what
[57:35] God called him to do he had to have a
[57:37] Nazarite vowel
[57:38] right
[57:40] every time the angel of the Lord
[57:41] appeared to the prophet or his brother
[57:43] will come

[57:51] its presence amongst us and we want him
[57:53] to use us
[57:55] we need to consecrate our life together
[57:57] amen
[57:59] now a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[58:03] because of all that he knew of God got
[58:06] the knowledge that he had the theology
[58:09] that he had took it out of him
[58:12] until he could go into there
[58:13] to the desert
[58:15] in the back part of the desert in Arabia
[58:17] and God could reveal himself to him
[58:20] amen God had to take out the knowledge
[58:23] that Moses had for 40 years yes Amen in
[58:28] Egypt
[58:29] God took it out
[58:32] God has to take out all this worldly
[58:34] thinking all his legacy and knowledge
[58:37] that we have because with all let us
[58:40] here can show us through its sides he
[58:42] can never understand God the great
[58:44] excited us after now he can't understand
[58:46] the strong
[58:48] but we have to Humble ourselves
[58:51] come and by faith we believe yet we
[58:54] wasn't there yet we never witnessed it
[58:57] with our eyes
[58:58] what makes us believe it
[59:00] it is a gift of God Amen Revelation is
[59:03] the gift of God
[59:05] God has personally made it known to us
[59:07] amen and we appreciate him for that we
[59:10] can give up like the world we could have
[59:12] been confused like the world
[59:15] we could have been not understanding
[59:17] what is all these things but he's come
[59:19] to revealing to us

[1:02:43] Amen brother Joshua thank you for the
[1:02:45] blood of the Lord amen amen hallelujah
[1:02:48] amen that's a revelation to us
[1:02:51] amen hidden from the wise and The
[1:02:54] Prudent of the world
[1:02:57] and if you know the prophet of God tells
[1:02:59] us
[1:03:01] that even though Revelation chapter 8 is
[1:03:05] silence
[1:03:06] under that seventh seal
[1:03:09] this is a direct quote now he says the
[1:03:11] setting of it is found in Revelation 10.
[1:03:15] amen
[1:03:17] he says the setting of that seven seal
[1:03:19] is found in Revelation 10.
[1:03:22] amen hallelujah so we know amen that
[1:03:25] even as we begin to read this and
[1:03:27] understand all of these things
[1:03:29] we are caught up in that mystery of that
[1:03:32] sincere
[1:03:34] that is why you can show somebody
[1:03:37] pictures
[1:03:41] they won't understand this
[1:03:45] if you notice the prophet says if you
[1:03:47] look at the picture the way it should be
[1:03:50] I mean if you read that quote but the
[1:03:52] Joshua just read it now he says if you
[1:03:54] look at the picture the way it should be
[1:03:57] I look at many churches and they slept
[1:04:00] the picture this way
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:02] yet the Lord told the prophet and it is
[1:04:05] the rising of the sun he preaches and he
[1:04:06] says turn it to the right amen
[1:04:09] amen so they're not even looking at the
[1:04:11] cloud the right way they want to look at
[1:04:13] it the way science took it yeah
[1:04:15] but you look at it the way science took
[1:04:17] it you can't see nothing
[1:04:19] but when you look at it the right way
[1:04:21] amen amen you see Christ now if you
[1:04:25] notice something there in Revelation
[1:04:26] chapter 10 he says another Mighty angel
[1:04:30] came down from heaven
[1:04:33] he's coming for a purpose amen he's
[1:04:36] coming with a purpose
[1:04:38] amen
[1:04:40] hallelujah amen amen so he's coming from
[1:04:43] heaven
[1:04:45] he is crossing Dimensions amen
[1:04:49] hallelujah is not coming in a spacecraft
[1:04:54] but he's traveling through Dimensions
[1:04:55] the prophecy is faster than you can
[1:04:58] blink your eyes there the Angels were
[1:04:59] there
[1:05:02] amen hallelujah and you know the Angel
[1:05:05] The Voice not I don't want to preach
[1:05:08] here now but I want to tell you this
[1:05:11] Heaven and Earth were connected amen if
[1:05:14] you read Revelation 10
[1:05:15] because there's a voice from Heaven
[1:05:17] speaking to John first he tells him
[1:05:19] don't write
[1:05:21] and then it's fixed him again and he
[1:05:23] tells him go and take the book from the
[1:05:24] end of the Angel and eat the book now in
[1:05:27] order to eat you must be hungry
[1:05:29] in order to eat you must have an
[1:05:31] appetite
[1:05:32] amen otherwise somebody's going to be
[1:05:34] Force feeding you
[1:05:37] so the instruction is given to John and
