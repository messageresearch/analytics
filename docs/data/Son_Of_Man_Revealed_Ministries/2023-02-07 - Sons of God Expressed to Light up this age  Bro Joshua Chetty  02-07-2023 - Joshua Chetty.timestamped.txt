[19:07] the seven Church angels He showed that
[19:09] this was the age that was completely
[19:10] blackened out amen amen but by faith he

[19:15] he knew that he's preaching a message
[19:19] for a special kind of people amen amen
[19:22] amen amen a message that will attract a
[19:25] special kind of people yes and these

[19:38] because remember God is the father of
[19:41] Lights amen so we are sons of God that
[19:44] we must Express lights yes amen and no
[19:48] and the only people on the Earth right
[19:50] now to express light is you and I amen
[19:53] because you're walking in the midst of
[19:55] Darkness
[19:56] amen so if you are not expressing lights
[19:59] then you are part of Darkness yes but if

[20:45] and wherever we're walking we're walking
[20:48] with the word in US embedding us amen

[20:58] God with us but we are walking an hour
[21:01] with God in us
[21:03] God in us we have to express the image

[21:09] in us we are expressing light amen
[21:14] and John 14 12 says verily verily I say
[21:18] unto you he that believeth on me the
[21:21] works that I do shall he do also and
[21:24] Greater Works than these shall he do
[21:27] amen
[21:29] because I go unto my father and
[21:32] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[21:36] will I do that the father may be
[21:38] glorified in the son and if he shall ask
[21:42] anything in my name I will do it
[21:46] if you ain't love me keep my
[21:48] Commandments
[21:51] and I will pray the father and he shall
[21:53] give you another comforter amen that he
[21:56] may be with you forever
[21:58] even the spirit of truths whom the world
[22:01] cannot receive because it said him not
[22:04] neither knoweth him but they know him
[22:07] for he dwelleth would you and shall be
[22:10] in you amen hallelujah thank you I will
[22:13] not leave you comfortable
[22:15] I will come to you
[22:17] yet a little while and the world see at
[22:19] me no more but ye see me because I live
[22:23] ye shall live also at that day you shall
[22:26] know that I am in my father and Yea in
[22:29] me and I in you amen amen this is our
[22:33] way is coming to Union with us amen
[22:36] this is a sweet Union where now we
[22:39] understand what Jesus was talking about
[22:40] he said the eye and the Father the
[22:43] father and me and I in you amen so you
[22:46] know this Union through this Union we
[22:48] know that Christ come and dwell in US
[22:50] amen he's the one that is leading us
[22:52] he's the one that's guiding us amen amen
[22:55] that's why in John Jensen it says the
[22:57] thief cometh not but for to steal yes
[23:00] and to kill yeah and to destroy but I am
[23:03] come that they might have life and they
[23:06] might have it more abundantly amen so
[23:09] we're speaking about Son of God Express
[23:11] to light up this age and for the
[23:13] subtitle we're speaking about equipped
[23:15] to lead a super Abundant Life amen you
[23:19] know what that now more abundance amen
[23:22] something that's more abundant is super
[23:24] abundance amen so we have been equipped
[23:26] to leave the super Abundant Life I don't
[23:29] believe that Christ wants us to be a
[23:32] living a life that is defeated amen amen
[23:36] well aware
[23:37] that the enemy what the enemy tactics
[23:39] are he's well aware that enemy will come
[23:41] and steal amen he's well aware that the
[23:44] enemy will come and destroy yes you will
[23:46] come and kill thank you but he has come
[23:48] to equipas amen thank you he's come to
[23:51] guide us through this age amen amen
[23:53] that's why he said Greater Works than
[23:56] these they shall do yeah because now he
[23:59] knew that they were coming our way he's
[24:01] going to dwell in a many-membered body
[24:02] yes amen
[24:05] he knew that he had to come and dwell in
[24:06] the midst of a people amen and express
[24:09] himself amen
[24:11] and he says Greater Works than these
[24:13] they shall do because he's dwelling in
[24:15] us he's doing the works through us he's
[24:17] continuing the work there must be you
[24:20] see Christ's Adam stops his work
[24:23] when he left he poured out the Holy
[24:25] Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost gave birth
[24:28] to the church and in every age God has
[24:31] called up the people he's been a
[24:32] continuity amen until now we've come and
[24:36] we're reaching the climax now amen where
[24:38] is fulfilling all that he said he will
[24:40] do
[24:41] Darkness
[24:44] become our now when the world is in a
[24:47] certain condition amen
[24:50] that's right maybe 10 10 years ago 20
[24:52] years ago you wouldn't you would you
[24:54] would say no it's just people talking
[24:56] like that but now it's what I'm talking
[24:58] about is sudden condition where Sodom is
[25:02] around you yes amen 100
[25:05] amen that even now
[25:08] people who do not have this word
[25:11] know there's something wrong yeah know
[25:14] that there's something wrong with
[25:15] mankind yes because we are living in
[25:19] such a
[25:20] an age where sin is become so legalized
[25:24] yeah
[25:25] yeah amen because they crossed the
[25:26] dividing line and when you cross the
[25:29] dividing line you will sin and continue
[25:31] to sin and have no remorse for sin yeah

[51:36] that by two immutable things
[51:39] it was impossible for God to lie yes God

[52:30] we might have a strong consolation we

[52:41] Soul

[53:47] Prince and King in paragraph 74. he says
[53:50] what a marvelous promise
[53:53] the two immutable things that God cannot
[53:56] lie and be God now if God was made a
[53:59] promise in his Bible here we believe the
[54:01] Bible to be
[54:02] the infallible word of God
[54:05] and if God has made a promise in this
[54:07] Bible we have this consolation and know
[54:11] that it's impossible for God to lie amen
[54:13] therefore when we see he promised it in
[54:15] the Bible we believe it yes

[54:53] there because when you receive his word
[54:55] when you receive that reasoning
[54:58] and you exceed that means you are
[54:59] receiving a seed right amen when you
[55:01] receive that seed it becomes manifest
[55:04] but cancel it amen resist the devil yeah
[55:07] and he shall flee amen say Satan it is

[1:02:56] Galatians 3 16 says and not to Ibraham
[1:03:00] and his Seed where the promise is made
[1:03:02] he said not into seeds as of many but as
[1:03:05] of one and to die seed which is Christ
[1:03:07] and this I say that the Covenant that
[1:03:10] was confirmed before God before a God in
[1:03:12] Christ the law which was 430 years after
[1:03:15] cannot listen now that it should make
[1:03:18] the promise of none effect but if the
[1:03:21] instance inheritance be of the law it is
[1:03:24] no more promise but God gave it to
[1:03:28] Abraham by promising amen amen how did
[1:03:32] he give it by a promise
[1:03:36] but to Christ and we come from the sea
[1:03:39] royal Seed of Abraham which is to Christ
[1:03:41] amen amen and all blessings are of
[1:03:44] Promise amen amen because
[1:03:47] this is what he gave to everyone by
[1:03:49] promise because by faith
[1:03:51] Abraham believed God Amen it's a fake
[1:03:53] seed amen
[1:03:57] so you see if you trace your technology
[1:03:59] it's a fake genealogy goes all the way
[1:04:01] to God Amen not the fate of men but the
[1:04:04] faith of God yes it's a faith genology
[1:04:07] it goes all the way
[1:04:09] because your life comes from God
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:16] so we're walking we're talking about
[1:04:17] speaking now and living abundantly not
[1:04:19] living a gloomy life Proverbs 3 9 says
[1:04:22] honor the Lord would I substance
[1:04:25] would all with the first fruits of then
[1:04:27] increase so shall thy bond be filled
[1:04:30] with plenty and thy pressure shall be
[1:04:32] burst over with new wine my son despise
[1:04:36] not the chastening of the Lord neither
[1:04:38] be wary of his correction for whom the
[1:04:40] Lord loverly corrected even as Father
[1:04:43] the Son in whom the son in whom he
[1:04:45] delighted so God is giving you a
[1:04:47] scripture now you see in scripture God
[1:04:49] is telling you how you can be blessed
[1:04:51] now how you can live in this Abundant
[1:04:53] Life now

[1:05:16] things that you desire all the things

[1:07:04] about why the Jews are so blessed
[1:07:06] people always wondered why their Jews
[1:07:08] was blessed with money
[1:07:10] well the first thing about the Jew
[1:07:13] the first thing when he goes into
[1:07:15] business he doesn't rely upon himself
[1:07:18] imagine under the blood of Woolen gold
[1:07:22] the Christ is now not even have turned
[1:07:25] away from them and come to the Gentiles

[1:07:33] they believe that when they go into
[1:07:35] anything into any dealing God is with
[1:07:38] them so in other words they put in their

[1:09:14] there's something wrong about your work

[1:09:58] of maybe a family member or people that
[1:10:01] you know that are not saved
[1:10:03] how do you feel
[1:10:06] yeah when you know especially when you
[1:10:08] know a person that definitely wasn't in

[1:10:33] he would sow it sparingly he'll reap
[1:10:36] also sparingly yes
[1:10:37] that's that's that's the principles of
[1:10:40] God that can't change God can't change
[1:10:42] his law
[1:10:44] it cannot change his law amen and he
[1:10:47] would sow it beautiful bountifully shall
[1:10:49] reap also bountifully
[1:10:52] every man according as the purpose in
[1:10:54] his heart so let him give not grudgingly
[1:10:57] or of necessity for God loves a cheerful
[1:11:00] Giver amen amen so when you're giving
[1:11:03] even given to your own household person
[1:11:05] help your own first amen you got
[1:11:08] something God has rescued something and
[1:11:10] a believer of need of it help your
[1:11:11] people first amen amen amen help the
[1:11:14] author of The Faith first
[1:11:16] yeah
[1:11:19] and when you give you see what it says
[1:11:21] here not drudgingly so if you're doing
[1:11:24] something for a believer
[1:11:25] doing something for the things of God
[1:11:27] don't do it grudgingly or necessity
[1:11:30] for God love it and cheerful yes so when

[1:11:55] goodness Faith meekness Temperance again
[1:11:58] such day is no law
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:03] and the famous portion of scripture
[1:12:04] which is a must Malachi 3 10.
[1:12:08] because don't even ask anybody to pray
[1:12:10] for your blessings if you don't follow
[1:12:12] the scripture
[1:12:14] bring ye all the tides into the straws
[1:12:19] that there may be made in my notes
[1:12:23] and prove now see God is asking to prove
[1:12:25] yeah
[1:12:26] in the Bible say Do not Test the Lord
[1:12:28] your God
[1:12:30] but yeah he's saying prove now prove me
[1:12:33] now your word saved the Lord of vote
[1:12:36] if I will not open you the windows of
[1:12:39] Heaven
[1:12:41] and pour you out a blessing
[1:12:44] that there shall not be room enough to
[1:12:47] receive it
[1:12:50] even room to receive it
[1:12:53] and I will rebuke the Devourer for your
[1:12:55] sakes so you see that same scripture
[1:12:58] John 10 10. the enemy that's coming to
[1:13:01] steal that's coming to destroy
[1:13:04] the Devourer amen amen he said I will

[1:13:38] because you are going to be that light
[1:13:40] amen yes you're gonna light up this
[1:13:43] nation
[1:13:44] you're gonna light up the place that you
[1:13:46] are
[1:13:48] and you're going to be the delightsome
[1:13:49] land
[1:13:50] amen this is your land amen be in the
[1:13:53] land the land of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:13:55] we're dwelling in the land how's your
[1:13:57] land how's your body amen
[1:14:01] say the Lord of hosts
[1:14:06] I don't have much more of this clothing
[1:14:09] you're trusting God for healing amen he
[1:14:12] says in the message
[1:14:15] confirmation and evidence
[1:14:17] in a mission in the message confirmation
[1:14:20] and evidence
[1:14:21] paragraph 37.
[1:14:25] confirmation and evidence
[1:14:28] Telegraph 37.
[1:14:30] now in Hebrews we taught again that D
[1:14:35] fate equals 11 faith is the substance of
[1:14:38] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[1:14:40] Not Seen it's a substance
[1:14:43] now it isn't a hope
[1:14:45] most people come with hope a hope is
[1:14:48] going to be done I hope you know I hope
[1:14:50] I'm going to be healed yeah
[1:14:52] hope I'll have money in my bank account
[1:14:55] that's a hope
[1:14:57] there's a difference with open faith
[1:14:58] faith is something solid tangible
[1:15:02] right he says
[1:15:05] now it isn't a hope most people come
[1:15:07] with hope but faith is the substance it
[1:15:10] isn't something that you're hoping for
[1:15:12] when faith has taken a hole you have a
[1:15:15] substance not just him but you've got a
[1:15:17] whole of something you know it nothing
[1:15:19] shakes you from it amen it's yours
[1:15:22] you're positive
[1:15:23] you have it in your hand you got it it's
[1:15:26] your possession amen amen like the
[1:15:29] brother was healed the blind man he was
[1:15:31] healed and he took it it wasn't seen
[1:15:34] no one could see it naturally in the
[1:15:36] physical in a Physical Realm they
[1:15:38] couldn't see it but he took all of it
[1:15:40] amen it was his possession amen he
[1:15:43] possessed it amen and he began to be
[1:15:45] positive he began to confess it and
[1:15:47] confess it until one day while sitting
[1:15:50] in the Bible room everything sight began
[1:15:52] to come amen
[1:15:53] it became it became manifested amen
[1:15:58] for instance see what it says here if I
[1:16:00] was starving
[1:16:02] was dying of starvation
[1:16:04] and a loaf of bread would save my life
[1:16:08] and the purchase of a loaf of bread is
[1:16:10] 25 cents
[1:16:11] and someone gave me the 25 cents
[1:16:15] now just as much as I can see and I know
[1:16:17] that I hold at 25 cents which is the
[1:16:20] buying power of the loaf of bread
[1:16:22] I can be just as happy with the 25 cents
[1:16:26] I could be with the loaf of bread for
[1:16:29] already have the purchasing power that
[1:16:31] buys the loaf of bread so you already
[1:16:34] got it
[1:16:35] you got that purchasing power but now
[1:16:38] when you want it you go and apply to use
[1:16:40] it amen
[1:16:42] so that's what faith is saying if you
[1:16:44] believe that in my faith it's already
[1:16:45] given is that substance amen
[1:16:50] so that's why
[1:16:51] so that's the way fit is Faith is
[1:16:54] something you have
[1:16:55] you got it and when you receive faith
[1:16:58] that God is then God is going to give
[1:17:00] you this yet your healing might not be
[1:17:03] there
[1:17:04] but yet Something Is Anchored within you
[1:17:06] tells you that it's going to be all
[1:17:08] right
[1:17:09] then you can be just as happy as you
[1:17:11] were
[1:17:12] you see
[1:17:13] you you might be having the signal the
[1:17:15] certain thing that you trust in God for
[1:17:16] any healing
[1:17:18] but if you anchor your faith on his word
[1:17:19] and say it's done amen and you take God
[1:17:21] at his word it's there
[1:17:24] so you know you don't continue being
[1:17:25] said about that condition now amen you
[1:17:27] don't be negative in other words don't
[1:17:28] be negative about the condition
[1:17:31] confess the positive
[1:17:33] saying I am healed amen it's done amen
[1:17:36] it's finished I have it by faith it's
[1:17:38] angered it's done and as you keep
[1:17:40] confessing now according to your
[1:17:42] confession it's gonna manifest he's
[1:17:44] going to manifest in this realm it's
[1:17:46] done already in the Supernatural Realm
[1:17:48] but in this realm it will manifest in
[1:17:51] the time that is supposed to manifest
[1:17:53] but it will con if you continue in your
[1:17:56] confession
[1:17:58] so he says
[1:18:00] you continue being just as happy sitting
[1:18:02] in a wheelchair as you wear out there
[1:18:04] jumping on the street up and down
[1:18:06] nobody putting it right in a wheelchair
[1:18:08] but in a wheelchair now
[1:18:10] but he's saying they must continue being
[1:18:12] happy
[1:18:14] shouting and running around praising God
[1:18:16] because you already got the evidence
[1:18:18] amen amen amen amen amen
[1:18:23] see it is a name it and imagine it isn't
[1:18:27] an imagination it's a substance
[1:18:32] when you get yourself you get a signal
[1:18:34] in your bank account on your phone
[1:18:36] saying you got so much in your bank
[1:18:38] account right
[1:18:39] you don't have to evidence
[1:18:41] right you haven't put the money in your
[1:18:43] hand isn't it
[1:18:44] but you've got the evidence there right
[1:18:46] you believe it amen you believe it
[1:18:48] because you can see it right right
[1:18:50] that's your phone account but that's
[1:18:52] another that's through the fourth
[1:18:53] dimension you're receiving it
[1:18:55] right in your phone account is coming
[1:18:56] through there the money is floating in
[1:18:58] the fourth dimension but now when you go
[1:19:01] to the ATM now you want to draw that
[1:19:02] physical money
[1:19:04] then you go and do it because you had
[1:19:05] faith enough to believe that the money
[1:19:07] is there right amen you draw it just
[1:19:09] like that God has given it his word it's
[1:19:11] done there that's right yes so angry
[1:19:13] your faith day it's done you said two
[1:19:16] immutable things God cannot lie yeah
[1:19:17] amen so it's done it's in his word
[1:19:20] that's right so if we can't lie if you
[1:19:22] can believe the bank account why can't
[1:19:23] you believe
[1:19:24] God's word yes sir amen so take him by
[1:19:28] his word if you believe is what he's
[1:19:30] there take it and apply it
[1:19:32] taking and apply to your knee today yes
[1:19:34] whatever your need may be take his word
[1:19:37] and apply there amen amen then you
[1:19:39] become positive about it you start
[1:19:40] confessing it amen yes then go and
[1:19:42] justify about it amen maybe it's not
[1:19:45] materializing as yet but there will be
[1:19:47] an hour it's going to materialize amen
[1:19:50] but the devil will come to steal to
[1:19:52] destroy he doesn't want you to have that
[1:19:54] Abundant Life but God wants you to live
[1:19:56] more abundantly amen amen he wants you
[1:19:59] to walk in this super Abundant Life amen
[1:20:01] yes sir
[1:20:04] Hallelujah because why you are the
[1:20:06] people put on the earth to light up this
[1:20:08] age you are not here by chance when God
[1:20:11] predestinated someone is not by chance
[1:20:12] God if we prepared a place for you and
[1:20:15] play a time that you'll come here a time
[1:20:17] and season that you are pre-planned to
[1:20:19] be here amen amen amen he was
[1:20:22] pre-planned that you'll come in his age
[1:20:23] so he given you the word to equip you
[1:20:26] for this age amen amen
[1:20:28] he said you have that you you
[1:20:32] hope that you will you kind of have an
[1:20:35] imaginary faith and that you feel that
[1:20:38] you have appropriated that but when
[1:20:40] actually you got a whole of Faith it's a
[1:20:43] substance
[1:20:44] it says something real then you hold it
[1:20:47] then what brings it amen
[1:20:51] take your mind last two quotes
[1:20:55] in the message my redeemer liveth
[1:21:00] he saw God was with him
[1:21:03] sorry paragraph I think it's from 118.
[1:21:08] he saw God was with him wherever he did
[1:21:10] nobody was a prince of prosperity
[1:21:13] speaking about Joseph the world
[1:21:14] prospered everywhere Joseph was there
[1:21:17] was a prosperity for he was the prince
[1:21:20] of prosperity
[1:21:21] and even for sharing Christ wherever
[1:21:24] Christ is there is prosperity amen and
[1:21:28] when Christ returns to the Earth all the
[1:21:31] curse of the earth will be taken away
[1:21:33] some of these days the old desert child
[1:21:36] Blossom as a rose and the rough places
[1:21:38] will be made smooth amen and shall bring
[1:21:41] forth in the abundance for he is the
[1:21:44] prince of prosperity wherever he is amen

[1:22:01] must Prosper amen
[1:22:03] your spiritual work must Prosper your
[1:22:06] walking defeat must Prosper amen amen

[1:22:12] in the message six-fold purpose of
[1:22:14] Gabriel's visit to Daniel you say it's
[1:22:16] in paragraph 69 he was the type of the
[1:22:18] son of prosperity everything Joseph done
[1:22:21] prospered and when Jesus returned in the
[1:22:23] Millennium that's the reason the desert
[1:22:25] will Blossom as he rose everything he
[1:22:27] does will prosper he is the son of
[1:22:29] prosperity wherever you put Joseph it
[1:22:32] was blessed wherever Jesus is it's
[1:22:34] blessed so get him in your heart and be
[1:22:37] blessed amen amen you want to be blessed
