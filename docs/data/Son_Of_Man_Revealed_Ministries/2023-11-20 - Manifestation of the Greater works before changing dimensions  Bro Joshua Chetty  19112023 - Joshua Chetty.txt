it but sovereignly by his grace amen amen by his election by his for choosing God has predestinated us to receive this glorious truth because we were always part of him amen we come from him and we go

right so we' got him preaching for us on Mother's Day and the combin meeting so we pray that the Lord will have blessing upon meeting amen amen are you excited this morning amen yes are you excited to be children of God in this hour amen amen where you're looking all around you and people are confused um people right now you know we we man is gone so insane right now and the only thing the prophet said that can keep the people saying he the Holy Ghost oh yes he keeps you on a gravitational level amen only the Holy Ghost can keep you like that and outside the holy ghost man is lost is living in fear amen but the Bible says perfect love casted away all fear amen amen the Bible say he did not give us a spirit of fear but a power and of a sound mind amen and only the people in the message of the hour the people that received this can walk and have a sound mind in this day every other person is being influenced with every ISM with every with every man-made system with every ideology of mankind but when when you receive the mind of Christ the mind is closed to the things of the world and the things from this Cosmos the world order amen your mind is closed to the world order when you hear things from the world order you can you are you are seeing things with your spiritual eyes and Through The Eyes of God's word you can see what is happening around you but if you did not receive the mind of Christ in this day you too will be we we as well would have been given away to every ideology and every system of man so this is purely the grace of God Amen I me let's stand to our feet as we get to the word I believe that God has preserved a people amen for a day and hour as such as this amen amen the Book of Judges let's turn to the Book of Judges we'll read from the Book of Judges from chapter 13 just for a context we'll start with Judges 13 reading from 1 to 5 and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of Zora of the family of the danites whose name was menoa you know what the symbol of the denit was it was a symbol of the eagle and his wife was Barren and be not and I believe nothing is done by chance I believe she was Barren for a reason because there was a certain time in season only that you would bring forth cuz God works with times and Seasons amen and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren and beareth not but thou shall conceive and bear a son amen now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the end of the Philistines amen amen we go back now to the Judges chapter 16 reading from verse 23 amen you know the we all know the story of Samson right we know the history here but now we see this part is coming now to the end of his lifespan on Earth or he's coming now to his Point of Departure judge 16:23 then the Lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Deon their God and to Rejoice for they said our God had delivered Samson our enemy into our hand and when the people saw him they praised their God for they said our God had delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us us you see because when Samson was under the an operating under the anointing of God it was destruction to the Philistines amen amen no Philistine could stand in his way when he was operating under the anointing and they had to send a seducing Spirit to come and make him to penalize his fi to take away what God has given him as a Nazarite vow and then take the anointing away from him and when the people saw him they praised that God but he said our God had delivered into our hand our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us and it came to pass when the hearts were merry that they said call for Samson that he may make us spot and they call for Samson out of the prison want to make a mockery out of him and he made them spot and they set him between and they set him between the pillars now the pillars are things that holds the building pillars that holds the ideologies pillars are things that are holding the man-made systems together but thank God we received the P of fire in this day amen amen that same P of fire that separated that came as a column separated the children of Israel and and the Egyptians amen and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that I may feel the pills whereupon the house stand it you see they are building on something that will fall down but our our house is built upon ANS that you cannot be made over here in this land amen that I may lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and all the Lords of the Philistines were there and they were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women so these were all the rulers and all the great people in the philis from the Philistines and they were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women and that be that beheld while Samson made spot and Samson called unto the Lord and said oh Lord God remember me amen now Samson is having a prayer meeting he realized that the anointing had left him and he realized what paralyzed his faith being by giving into the seducing Spirit of theila and realized that paralyzed his faith that he couldn't operate under the anointing any longer and remember this is a time where Samson eyes were taken out amen this is a time when there's no prophet in the land Samson was a judge there was no prophets at that time but yeah remember he was the seven judge of Israel but now we're talking about the time when his eyes is taken out what his eyes is typing the Sea of the age the prophet of the age is of the scene amen Samson's eyes are taken out he said Remember Me watch him now he's coming now prayerfully amen and strengthen me I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be at once avenge of the Philistines of my for my two eyes and Samson took all of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was born up so watch is praying now he's is's building his feet muscles now amen amen and Samson took all of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was born up of the one with is right and of the other with is left amen and Samson said let me die with the Philistines Samson is willing now to die to himself to sacrifice his life amen because he know this is the hour of the Greater Works and to do the Greater Works from all his ministry he has to sacrifice and die to self amen he has to sacrifice his life yes amen because when he was selfish and given into the desires of the flesh it paralyzed his faith and he lost the anointing yes and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell down fell upon the Lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his dead were more than which they slew in his life life amen you may be SE we turn quickly to the Book of Joel 2:23 Joel 2:23 beig glad then your children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the letter rain in the first month and the flo shall be full of Wheat and the fet shall overflow with wine and oil now if I want to bring it back to the now you know you know what the first month is typing in the in the time of Israel was typing the sand right and so so you'll know what happened here Amen in this assembly what God will started doing here in this year amen amen we find and the floow shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil amen and I will restore to you the years that the Locust had eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the pmer worm my great Army which are sent among you and yet they shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that dwelt wonderously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel if you look at that word that I am amen amen amen when Moses asked the Lord what he said I am amen and what did Jesus said to the Pharisees before Moses was I am before Abraham was I am and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed amen and it shall come to pass now let's look at that word ashamed the only time you'll ever be ashamed of this gospel is when you received the Holy Ghost amen there was a time where Peter was ashamed to admit that he was with Jesus and there was a time were yet to deny Jesus not once not twice but twice but when the Holy Ghost come down this same Peter now with bolus began to Proclaim this very Jesus that he denied amen so when you receive the Holy Ghost you will not be ashamed to be associated with Jesus and way Jesus now is amongst his people is in his word in the message of the hour amen which is now being manifested in a people because there's a people that's been eating this word and they now receive this word and become a manifestation of this word so where is Jesus in a people hallelujah yes amen so out of the if you don't have the Holy Ghost you will be ashamed to say I'm associated with the message of the hour but if you got the Holy Ghost you will not be ashamed to associated with everything that goes with the message if you're a sister that's having your hair and you're not ashamed because people are picking on your ear you're not ashamed of the type of dressing you wear you're not ashamed because you don't wear lipstick and makeup and you don't wear all the jewelry that they wear you're not ashamed to be associated with the things of God you not that you be ashamed to say I cannot be with you because I'm going to church amen thank you Lord You're not ashamed to say I cannot partake with the things of this world I cannot be associated with you going to nightclubs I cannot be associated with you worldly music I cannot be associated with your gossip I cannot be associated with you while you're drinking because I am a child of God thank you Lord and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prop your old men shall dream dreams and young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the anmat in those days will have pour out my spirit amen we want to speak on this morning the manifestation of the Greater Works just before changing Dimensions amen because that Samson did the Greater Works in the Judgment hour so shall we do the Greater Works in this hour amen just before notice this now just before Samson changed dimensions in other words before because he's going to die right before his death after his death he's going to change Dimensions he going to go to paradise so just before changing Dimensions he produced the Greater Works amen amen amen and just before this bride amen will become the final voice in this final hour just before she changed Dimensions amen from the terrestrial amen from the Earthly to the Heavenly from the terrestrial to the celestial from the Earthly to the Heavenly before she change Dimensions amen from this corruption to incorruption from mortality to immortality she's going to produce the Greater Works amen so you can see when this Greater Works is happening before the changing of dimension amen John 17:23 Jesus says and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them amen that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me amen so who it is it is Christ in you yes doing the Greater Works amen amen we can do nothing of ourselves it is Christ in US yes but it comes with a sacrifice amen because maybe there was a time when we received this word and the anointing was so strong but there was a time where we may have slipped up there was a time when we went into the world Amen because was caught up with the things of the world Amen and maybe we were caught up with the spirit of the age we become complacent you might say but I'm not sinning I'm not doing the wrong things but I'm talking about being carried away with the age carried away with your career carried away with your work carried away with all kind of things by the things of God spend anything you spend more time with becomes your idol yes amen and maybe we was carried away with that but God has called us in this year amen to come once again to a consecration yes Lord because as long as Samson was under that Nazarite vow he had that anointing he could operate under the anointing amen but when he allowed Thea to cut those Seven Locks from his hair amen which was the Covenant that he had amen he couldn't operate under the anointing and he couldn't couldn't fulfill his commission but now when he realized that his hairs grew again amen the locks grew again then he remembered his Covenant amen amen yes and he when he once he's brought back to the word is bringing back to remembrance amen what the Covenant is about it is not I will it's not a covenant about us he I will Covenant am he said I will present myself a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle without blemish amen thank you Lord and you bring you brought to remembrance the Covenant amen you come back to the word and the word is now what is doing it's increasing your fake muscles amen and your fake muscles began to grow and when your muscles began to grow you realize now you are facing the worst enemy because this is the age where Al is Unleashed upon the Earth this is the hour where 200 million demons are on the earth yes trying to make fun of the things of God yeah trying to say that days of Miracle has passed days of Miracles have stopped with the prophets but this is the hour where you will not be ashamed to be associated with the things of God if you are walking in the Supernatural and experiencing the supernatural you'll not be ashamed to speak of the supernatural amen amen you'll not be ashamed to speak of the things that God is doing amongst you yes amen amen now when Samson was there he put his hands upon those posts he stood in between them and the Philistines were celebrating they're having such a big time because that's what these demons are doing they're saying we got this people now we've got them into the word they believe they got the message of the hour don't they don't know that they have to produce the Greater Works we stop them from doing that that's what that's what the demons are thinking now these demons have been thinking all these years we've got them to believe that they are settled in the message and then we receive a whole lot of message and message and message but not knowing how to operate the message amen amen imagine you studying to be a doctor and you just studying all the theory but you're not doing the Practical part of it amen they don't do any good right you all know how to take your hands and use your hands with those instruments amen amen but the Bible said the sign shall follow them that believe amen we are a commissioned people yes Lord amen amen oh yes Lord and we are Jesus said Greater Works than these ye shall do now if there's a oness between Jesus said father I pray that they be one even as we are one if there is a Oneness between us and Christ then it must be the same Works yes because it's not us doing the works it's Christ in us and Christ has to do the same thing all the time because is the same yesterday today and forever amen oh yes thank you Lord so these people were making a mockery out of Samson because they know they took his eyes away but what they didn't realize when the prophet was off the scene and the eyes was taken away it was the hour for the Greater Works God preserved him when the message was being preached when the prophet was here under the anointing and those demons couldn't take it there's a time when the prophet had to be taken off the scene because the demons could analy but there was a people being preserved that's why the message was stor up he was preaching to a Pentecostal bunch of denominations it wasn't for them they wouldn't be able to digest it but there was an hour coming where there was a people that was going to receive this word amen and it was going to take the five for Ministry that was going to shed light on the same word that was Tau up amen amen so Satan thought he's got he's got them because now there's no Prophet on the scene there's no works on the scene there's no manifestation of Jesus Christ on the scene and while that is happening you got all the quits going around and nothing is happening amongst the bride but Satan was happy but he didn't realize that nothing is out of season with God God is in control of all things in you at an appointed time an appointed season he's going to have a people that will receive this word not only will they receive this word they will Manifest this word and know how to operate this word because he said I'll run ride this Trail again amen I'll ride this Trail again the Covenant remains yes it takes the Holy Ghost who still comes back Amen to bring the same word to lights and here the Philistines were making fun of Samson and his 200 million demons upon the Earth were going on a rampage but there's a people are that are rising up amen that began to pray amen that come back to get consecrated to God that come back to the altar amen that come back with consecrated lives amen yes Lord realizing that they must produce those virtues to come to the stature of a perfect man realizing to do that they're now entitled to receive amen what was there contained in your seven tunders because it will be those S those Mis divinely revealed truths that will literally turn turn our heart back to the faith of the fathers amen and if the our faith is turned back to the father then it must produce the same Works yes amen that's right must produce another book of Acts amen Satan thought he had everything under his control but there coming an hour and the hour is now where the demons must be dealt with decisively amen amen yes this is a time of War amen this is a time of spiritual warfare am amen and Samson he began to put his hands upon those posts and while all the demons are celebrating the Philistines were celebrating he begin to think God is still God amen amen yes the prophet is not yet Hallelujah the same God that was with our prophets amen God remains God yes Lord his ways remain the same yes Lord cancer was defeated in the days of the Prophet cancer will be defeated in this day and cancer has been defeated in the now oh thank you Lord and you might think hey but he healed one brother of cancer he healed another brother of cancer maybe we ask too much of God no we receive from the inexhaustible Fountain of Life he can never run out the blessings of God the Redemptive blessing can never run out yesterday you said God you had a financial need he blessed you today you're frightened to go because you have another need God will still bless you amen and if he blessed you yesterday he's obligated to bless you today amen oh wonderful Lord amen don't you love our God He Still Remains God yes amen amen yes Lord manmade systems come and go that's right teachings come and go but God is still God Amen and God knows how to choose his people in the time and season he always has a preparing ground he takes you to a road of preparation thank you Lord he takes you to a journey in your life and he's preparing you amen you might wonder why you had to go the wrong way at certain times but what you didn't realize God used it for his purpose oh thank you Jesus thank you amen God was molding you he was shaping you he was refining you for the work that you're going to do oh thank you Lord amen thank you Lord so the Philistine Tau that they defeated Samson but they didn't know that they all was going to die but the same man that they thought they defeated because God Covenant cannot change amen amen Love You Lord so here Samson now the prophet says you begin to think God is still God I know he is I've tried him I put him to the test I know He Still Remains God it's me that's wrong I'm the one that sins yes you see God is still God yeah you want to enjoy the benefits of your Redemption blessings then realize where you have faulted yes cuz God never changed amen God never take away any of his blessings yes oh thank you His blessings remain the same we got to come back come back to the altar come back confess our wrongs come back and die to self amen you must be willing to die to the flesh the more you come out of the way then you can allow Christ to come and have his way amen amen amen let go of your self will and let God's will be accomplished in your life he said I'm the one that sin they didn't notice the tears running out of them blinded sockets dripping off his chin they didn't notice his lips moving Lord have done wrong let me die with the Philistines amen we want to die to the things of the flesh yes we want to die to the pest house amen we want to die to the thing that hindering us amen he wanted God's word manifested before that Jezebel more than he wanted his own life so we come to that point today we are saying Lord this Jezebel system around the world that's controlling this world we want your word to be manifested before that Jezebel amen more than we worry about our self righteous our selfish flesh we want God's will to be done amen amen oh if the desire could come to the church again he wasn't praying for a new order a new denomination but the word of God might be known again amen yes the promise that he once had might come back to him again he was aware of what would happen if his prayer was answered but he was ready and in dead Earnest oh if the church could only get like that hallelujah amen oh if the church could only realize that the same God that was working in such a mighty way with his Prophet that that same pillow of fire is here today that same pillow of fire is here amongst us the same angel of God is coming and breaking his word week after week amongst us amen if you only could realize that and get out of the way and separate from your from your flesh man yes die to self that God will come and abod in you amen then you can have the overcoming power because he has given us the anointing in this day of the flying eagle and Samson come from the tribe of Dan and they symbol was the eagle amen he said notice little Samson also as I spoke of last night he was very perseverant himself he said as long as he could feel those Seven Locks hanging down his back the Philistines mean nothing to him no matter if he had nothing but a job bone of a mule in his hand or whatever he had the Philistines of the gates of Gaza they me nothing to him as long as he could feel those Seven Locks that was the Covenant he said as long as the Christian as long as the Christian can feel that Covenant all things are possible to him that believeth amen when you can feel that Covenant faith in you that you are God's child and an heir of every one of his promised blessings and don't care what comes up you're more than a match for it amen he might bring you an ailment and every scientific reasoning behind it every doctor every physician every specialist you are saying I'm telling you but this is it this is all we can do in this condition it doesn't matter you go back to the Covenant you go back to your promise you anchor your faith upon the promise of God yes Lord God can turn the situation around yes amen amen you know when when it was Joshua was going to be born and the doctors the the gynecologist said we have to my wife has to have a SE Cesar and we didn't want that but she said the it's a risk and you have to have that but you know that God changed the situation around that when she went into labor that doctor wasn't around another doctor came and said right now there's nothing wrong with the child is and nothing wrong with you to have natural birth everything is right for you to have natural birth God can turned the situation around amen when Caleb was born he couldn't he couldn't uh sip on to the to the milk and then we prayed the minute we said amen you could hear the noise praise the Lord praise the Lord when Josephine was born she was born to the condition that needed an operation and I didn't want to pray for her I said Lord you give me at that time I said Lord give me something and I just opened my Bible and the lord gave me the word immediately I prayed and immediately it was right she came righten amen praise the Lord now that's the supernatural God that we serve he never did once he twice Thrice to show that he's the same yesterday today and forever so we seen the supernatural yeah here's my wife here a testimony the other day we were shopping you believe we we were living in a supernatural hour yes that's right we were shopping and she was going on you know normally we buy you buy groceries when you get paid right you buy your groceries when you get paid that's when on your payday and when you go to the shop you buy your normal things your bread milk your errands for the house but she was going to town buying all the things that she wants and I'm I know I only waiting for Payday for money and I got money I got money to get by but when you buy big things you need payday and she's shopping and she's going to town and we she comes with a trolley full of stuff at the till and I'm at the till and I'm about I said wait a minute I didn't I wasn't even thinking but sometimes you know we live in this Dimension but sometimes as a minister your your mind is already not you might be in a shopping mall but you're not there that's how my mind is sometimes you should be talking to me and I don't concentrate because sometimes like I'm in another place and then but but sometime God allows things to happen amen and we CU he create you know Pastor ad said God create allows he make create this opportunities for us he presents this opportunities amen so she's coming with a full trolley full of stuff at the cashier and I said but I don't have that money and I never got paid yet and something I don't know what may be look at my phone as I looked at my phone so it apparently that while she was putting the things in the trolley around about that time money came into my account amen amen more than enough for what you're shopping amen praise the Lord so this is the supernatural God that we serve and that morning Pastor Adrian put a quote he spoke about the brother and the Skeptics who talking to him about the God that he serves and he spoke about the wall you know and he said when when I get to the wall God Will Make Me amen amen so when we got to the t god Fai me Hallelujah this is the same God that you serve the same yesterday today and forever so don't tell me yes about not walking this is we've been seeing the supernatural been living in the Supernatural I know the supernatural God who come through more than once in our life there's too many innumerable times you could write a book on testimony you can write books on it amen amen because this is the god that we serve amen so don't look at your own bank balance yes that's right he is Jehovah our provider yes he is our father own Thousand Years who can give you Surplus money before payday but your father amen amen amen so he says as long as the Christian can feel that Covenant all things are possible to him that believe it when you can feel that Covenant faith in you you are God's child and an heir of every one of his promised blessings don't care what comes up oh yes Lord you're more than a match for it as long as you can feel and know that you believe it you follow me amen don't listen to the doctor's report right amen don't look don't worry about that bull doesn't matter what comes up as long as you can as Samson felt that he was all right as long as in your heart that you just not worked up you're just not emotional but in your heart that you know that you're going to get it you know when Faith settles in there amen amen Faith settles in that Soul amen you know that you have confessed your sin you know that you pass from Death To Life yes you're sacrificing yourself amen because you pass from Death to life look at it you're sacrificing yourself to have life amen you're sacrificing the temporary to have life yet people don't want to sacrifice the temporary the thing that will go back to the dust of the Earth people not willing to sacrifice something that's temporal for eternal life you get what I'm saying amen sacrifice the temporary because you are promised life amen because you're not from temporary you from eternal life amen amen you always was part of God yes you're an eternal being you cannot just start to be an eternal being you always was an eternal being and in the thoughts of God Amen manifested at appointed time in season amen but in your heart you know what you're going to get it you know that you have confessed your sin you know that you passed from the to life you know that you're a child of God and an heir of these things that there is nothing going to keep you from having it nothing no demon in h is going to keep you when it settled in there no demon no ISM no negativity is going to keep it from you amen if you believe it if it settle in your heart amen no skeptic is going to keep it from you amen then you are perseverant the book of Philippians 2: 5-7 says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus amen obeying in the form of God taught it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself on no reputation and took him and took him the form of a servant of made in the likeness of men amen so Jesus didn't think it robbery to be equal with God now we are part of God Amen if we part of him then we come like him and he came like a servant in the form of a servant and what does the servant do it serves yes and yeah in our case we serve God's people amen amen we live for others yes and that is why he said by the by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples when ye have loved one for another amen the world cannot have love the world don't know what love is the world tried to build you know the prophet was speaking about people building friendships by associations because you do this for me I'll do that for you a quit proo they call it you scratch my back I scratch your back it doesn't work l in the kingdom of God yeah you are able to love the unlovable amen you're able to forgive those that can't forgive you yes amen you're able to hate you love your enemies the ones that hate you because you are seeing things that they can't see amen you are seeing that they tormented by Spirit you not if you are delivered you a child of God you're born again you baptized with the Holy Ghost that same person that can't forgive you you are seeing that that person is bound by Spirit that's why they got unforgiveness but you are set free you pray for them amen
