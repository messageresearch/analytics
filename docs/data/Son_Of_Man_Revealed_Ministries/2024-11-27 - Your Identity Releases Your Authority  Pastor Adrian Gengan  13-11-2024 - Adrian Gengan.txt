song Amen and you know the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord amen praise the Lord so let's turn to our Bibles amen even as we go to the word for amen little it's our witness ton that pray meeting amen amen so we can get together and pray there's some needs amen that we need to take to the Lord let's turn to Jude 1:3 amen everybody feeling good in the house of the Lord amen in fact my opening remarks I'm going to get to it now now is about trust vers Faith amen amen and I like how the spirit Works to bring these things out and the song Can Be Sung that way amen so J 1:3 it says beloved when I gave you all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exalt you that you should earnestly contend for the faith amen which was once delivered unto the same amen for were there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lishness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ amen the Lord have blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated thank you amen praise the Lord so like I was saying amen there's some there's a difference between faith and trust and the example I was going to use was they were they were celebrating this one man who could ride a bike and they had so much of faith in this man that he could pass through a one side of the mountain to the other side of the mountain and he could ride on a narrow Plank and everyone applauded it and every time he would do it it' become more dangerous look more dangerous and everyone had faith in this man to say you can do it but then he sto one time and he said get on the bike and nobody would get on the bike so they have faith in the man but they didn't trust the man amen so we can't take control of situations in our life by having faith in Jesus but we want to take control of the situation because we don't trust Jesus to handle the situation amen so we've got to take it to another level and Trust Jesus completely amen praise the Lord now Hallelujah maybe I'll just title it Authority versus your identity or our true identity amen our Authority is released in our identity maybe that's what I want to say our true Authority is released in our identity amen so it's identity first then Authority released yes now we are Sons and Daughters of God that puts us in a special class of people and it gives us a special Authority because our father is King of the Earth he's not only King of the earth he's King of the heavens and the Earth amen so we find in Ephesians chapter 1 the prophet is teaching us at Ephesians parallels Joshua and in the very first chapter Ephesians chapter 1:3 you'll see the Apostle Paul trying to establish our identity first yes and the authority to take Satan's kingdom down comes in chapter 6 later so Authority is our identity is released here blessed be the god God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen we go through to verse amen continue reading to verse 5 there according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world what is he showing us now our identity our Origins our beginning that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love there's your charity there that we should be amen holy Without Blame before him in faith we should be holy Without Blame before him in hope love but in love amen we know 1 Corinthians 13:13 now remains faith hope and charity and the greatest of this is love this is the verse we want to get toight in verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so God's true purpose for us on the earth predestined means showing us the end of our destiny destination amen what we are going to end up we are ending up as adopted Sons and Daughters of God so collectively we are all the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ but individually we are Sons and Daughters of the most high God so God is releasing to us our identity first and with that is going to come the authority amen the the the book of Juda is telling us men have crept in unawares because people have now losing their identity right that is called identity crisis amen when somebody doesn't know their identity now we find this is a pattern there's something powerful about knowing who we are as Sons and Daughters of God because it reconnects us back with God's original purpose and design and his Plan of Redemption amen we know that sin came in and it uh amen it opened up the way now for God to release his attributes but when we see what God is made us in Christ now in the end time the prophet tells us that perfect faith is knowing who we are thank you Lord that releases of Faith to the individual when we know who we are amen so we can type this very quickly in the first Exodus the angel of the Lord comes to Moses in the burning bush establishing his identity as the deliverer of the children of Israel he gives him his identity first yes amen then he reveals to him his purpose and now he's going to him and then he sends him out with the authority amen amen we are going to find this pattern in all three Exodus praise the Lord amen and after after the how I'm going to say this after the prophet messenger comes there's always Joshua follows it amen amen wonderful there's always someone going into the land taking back what the messenger came to pave the way for amen Moses did it he led them to a certain point but God now comes in Joshua chapter 1 and he reveals Joshua's identity as you are going to be the one that's going to cross over into the promised land so there's always a followup Ministry to the prophet messenger yes amen amen we find this also in the second Exodus the voice of the Jordan of forun crying Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world but was that revealing Jesus true identity in part the true identity comes when the voice speaks from Heaven this is my beloved Son hallelujah amen revealing Jesus identity amen so when his identity is revealed it releases Authority within him because now he goes he's full of the Holy Ghost and he goes to be tested in the desert and he releases his authority and his authority is based on the word and he says it is written there can be no greater Authority than to base it on the word so you can see the pattern there again identity of Jesus revealed first then his authority is Unleashed amen amen praise the Lord then what follows Jesus ministry is the Greater Works and these shall he do yes on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost comes a type of Joshua Ministry and a people go into the land of the Holy Ghost people come back into the position you are seeing that the Peter and John man they standing at the gate beautiful able to command a man sced from birth amen and amen command him that his body be healed yes hallelujah hallelujah thank you amen praise the Lord you know that was Sunday's message Peter and John amen type of every True Believer faith and love amen sandwich in between is all other Seven Virtues but you're seeing the foundation and you're seeing the Capstone together amen that's a powerful man that's a man going in the Rapture that's a man walking in Authority that can go to a person and say stop looking around look on us deity is in me now Look on us there's some there's a bonus comes upon the believer when you recognize who you are you're a Son of God Satan can't mess with you amen you need to give him legal notice and kick him out of our Lives you have no legal Authority in my life you have no legal Authority in my family I'm a Son of God Amen so the Holy Ghost we know gives rest amen so there's a people who come to their rest after Jesus the son of man Ministry wonderful then we find now in the Third Exodus the angel of the Lord comes to brother Bram in a cave and he reveals to him his strange and misunderstood life what is he doing he's going to reveal his identity to him yes sir praise the Lord it gives him his identity and his purpose of what he is to do to take a message to the nations of the world and he's going to have two signs that's right Hallelujah amen one amen the sign in the hand the second amen he's going to be able to discern the secrets of the heart and then he tells him if you get the people to believe you are release such an authority upon your life that not even cancel will be able to stand in your way amen you know that's not out of scripture because even Peter's Shadow was healing people every essence about you because you're a Son of God ought to be full of authority full of power amen amen your presence in the work place at school at amen at University wherever you're going amen at home carries an anointing even your Shadow amen now remember you've got to believe that about yourself when you realize your identity it releases your Authority don't tell me that Peter had a crisis of his identity yes if he had a crisis of identity his shadow wouldn't have healed an ant but the Bible says they laid people in the streets perhaps that Peter Shadow would pass over them and the anointing that would be there would heal them I tell you your anointing doesn't leave you when you leave this earth they took a dead man once the soldiers somebody died amen and they threw them in the cave of Elisha amen that man came back to life amen hallelujah hallelujah amen oh we talk about a Superman you're a super son and daughter of God you carry an anointing when brother Brandon is talking about a super church and a super race he knows what he is talking about every f your being carries an anointing carries an authority can you imagine even you gone into the sixth Dimension your remains that remains here on the Earth all go back to the Earth all 16 elements but it still carries an anointing thank you Lord because you don't lose your anointing you don't lose your position you remember Samuel you are still a prophet yes sir amen so when God positions you he really positions you God doesn't give you a position today to demote you tomorrow but God is looking for increase in our lives God is looking for us to enlarge our borders in our territories that's why God honored JB's Faith he looked at this man with vision and he said I like this man he's not satisfied with the land that Joshua allocated to him and he's praying to me to enlarge my borders amen God likes a man with visions that expands amen that just we some a big God he said asking for big things amen amen Lord if you can just give me this little bit no he says asking for big things don't limit yourself amen ask him for big things because when he gives he gives exceeding abundantly above all that we can never ask for thing amen when when God gives he says he gives pressed down shaken together and running over God is not limited in his giving amen we may be limited in our giving when it comes to our offerings when it comes to our tide when it comes to our charity and giving to other people we may be thinking uh second thoughts about what we're going to do but God doesn't give that way right have you ever been in a position where money is not immaterial maybe you've experienced some form of it right at one stage you were struggling you couldn't even afford to buy bread but maybe God has blessed you in life now you can walk into a shop and you can buy 10 loaves of bread amen yeah so that's how we are in God's Kingdom right we have untapped resources and we have an unlimited potential but we we go and we shop sparingly yes do you know that sometimes you can have a mindset that because you grow up a certain way that even when money is released to you you can't spend it right that's right amen because your your purchasing power is based on an old mentality but now that the the the mighty Angel has come down he's released a new buying potential to us amen he says that all that the Father in Heaven has is given to you that title de means it's your Authority he's releasing an authority to the church amen so when brother brandham comes now is a messenger of the age revealing his identity what he's going to do he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers that's the first part of his ministry amen and he's going to also amen reveal the Mysteries the mystery of God you know that's Revelation 10:7 yes Hallelujah but following him now we showed you how every Ministry there had a followup there was a Joshua to a Moses there was the disciples to Jesus amen and there's got to be a people to follow brother bram's message amen a people who now possess the Holy Ghost amen a people will not just now remember what we said the fullness comes to you you've got to have the full Authority the full power amen if you are lacking that you need say Lord increase it Lord Jesus I want to operate in the Overflow amen I don't want to operate sparingly as I'm drinking it's going down down down there's got to be an overflow because that's how the Bride of the end time operates the wise virgin was not taking from The Vessel the oil in the lamp didn't run dry amen there was an overflow a continual flow of the spirit of God that she didn't even touch the Overflow as yet that's the level of anointing we want to operate in hallelujah amen hallelujah that's the level we ought to be increasing right now say Lord help me to ascend the realm of the heavenlies Lord Jesus help me to push the boundaries Lord Jesus I'm not satisfied in my all to be condition I want to move forward oh God Amen if we can have some Joshua here today amen if we can have some calebs here positioning amen and moving with Joshua the Holy Ghost amen we can advance kingdom of God hallelujah sir so what we are saying there's got to be a people filled with the Holy Ghost to follow the ministry of brother Brandon who connects with the same Angel that's right amen hallelujah it's an all-encompassing Cloud that was over the angel Mighty Angel he was clothed with a cloud have you ever seen a cloud in the heavens it clothes the evens right takes an expense so if you going to take the book from the angel you must come in contact with that cloud yes sir you've got to go into the vicinity of the cloud you've got to enter the cloud amen we've got to realize what we are we are in association with the Angelic world is what I'm trying to tell you amen the Angelic world Amen is here to connect with your faith because all of redemption plan is now locked up in you the fullness of what's going to happen at the end time is locked up in you God has positioned Us in this time and purpose to finish the race and now there's a cloud of many witnesses as we got the Baton and we are running the race with patience they are cheering us on saying you are just there at the Finish Line keep pushing forward keep moving forward you know why they cheering us on us finishing the race means that they come out of the graves amen so they are cheering for us finish the race finish the race so we can come back to the Earth amen amen amen praise the Lord Lord so we must have faith and trust in Jesus amen there's a difference between now contending for the faith and resting in faith but both are important we got to know when to rest and when to contend praise the Lord amen so we know to condemn means to strive for contest amen against difficulties amen the word means there to be strenuous or make a labored effort it means to fight to wrestle to content for the faith amen amen I say we content for the faith amen that was once deliver to brandom demon powers have been trying to strip the message down demon powers have come against an attack in the message do you know the message of the hour is the kingdom of God that's why the strongest attack is coming against the message of the hour and Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence and the violence take it by force amen amen hallelujah verse four is telling us false teachers have crept into the Christian Community crept into message churches perverting the grace of God denying The Authority that Jesus put into the church people are now want to say no The Authority only resu with the gr when he says we have become the final voice to the final age amen you know what it is weak faith not enough Faith they don't they in identity crisis they don't know who they are when you reject the cloud you're rejecting your identity praise the Lord because the prophet says that was our Lord up there Hallelujah to reject the Lord up there to reject your identity is to reject your genes your genealogy praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen so when Jesus is saying the kingdom you can put it up Matthew 11:12 if somebody's writing it down amen the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence amen amen and the violence take it by force some of us need to operate like that Satan is coming all out in in an onslaught against us all the fiery DTS of Hell appointed against us amen Onslaught Onslaught after Onslaught coming against us but we've got to fight back you know you get some children in school where the bully just bullies them and they take every punch they get until it comes a time amen when they say enough is enough today I'm going to put up my fist and I'm going to push back I'm going to fight back and when he push back against a bully he's not expecting that amen and he runs away amen the prophet of God says when you finally see the devil and you see what a little puny fellow he was and you wonder how this fellow deceived the nations of the earth sir praise the Lord so I I want to say this that the violent Onslaught on the enemy the violence of your faith amen is to establish your Authority in Christ amen when you are going against the enemy what are you exercising you Authority yes it's to exercise your Authority so when God is asking you to contend for the faith and exercise the violence of your faith against the enemy and unleash wrath upon the enemy because your faith causes wrath and Devastation upon the Satan's kingdom do you know them demons go running they go into a scramble they don't know how to operate when you operate in faith hallah amen demons are powerful when you operate by fear yes but when a man and a daughter of God Rises up in faith Satan Kingdom go into a panic and they scatter yes they couldn't stand the presence of Jesus and they even wanted to go into pigs I tell you if you can only see the the spiritual world when you walk by when you are coming by because you are carrying the light of God in this age and you see how demons start to scatter you see how people start to stutter you see how people start to scramble they don't want you in their presence because you carry an anointing and an authority of God Amen Hallelujah maybe you've experienced it more in the religious realm because you know how this religious demons they operate they don't want you to speak about the word of God most especially the religious Christian demons that's right no but our pastor see this way according to the tradition of our church we've always seen it this way amen but we want God's way to be our way that's the only way we want amen so God when he's telling us take it by force exercise violence upon the enemy he is releasing to us our Authority and revealing to us our Authority amen so some promises we have to fight for and some promises he wants us to be still and let us let it know amen let us know that he is God Amen praise the Lord some promises he wants us to be still and receive it by faith Hallelujah he's wanting when he's that when he's telling us be still and know that I am God that's a time he's now wanting us to know our identity because this is not of your own works this is by Grace there were certain works that Abraham could do but him having a child he couldn't do that was beyond him am God had to release that Grace to him for the changing of the body so what am I saying there are some things we can do in the Christian faith to advance the kingdom M but the body change we can't do because the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God Amen praise the Lord hallelujah so there are some things we are receiving by faith there are something we're advancing by faith amen praise the Lord amen remember I'm saying it again because I want you to understand this even the young people when you advancing the kingdom of God and tearing down Satan's kingdom you you are releasing your Authority when you are still and know that he is God he's revealing your identity you are my son you just rest I'm going to do this for you you go into the IE will Covenant praise the Lord so until we discover who we are and come into the place of rest of our identity nothing will be released to us we just showed you through three Exodus your identity first then the authority if there's no Authority released in your life first check your identity do you really know who you are in Christ amen so faith can be operated as a principle because faith is a law or faith can be operated by relationship amen when you have relationship with your father amen that's right amen we can't Advance the kingdom of God applying just Concepts and theories yes amen we can replace that with a walk with Christ amen yes a relationship with Jesus Christ that is what God wants us to do to rest in him to to let go of our burdens and let him carry them some some burdens in life are too much for us some we can't handle and some that's why Jesus says cast all your cares upon me for he carth for you amen Jesus says take my yoke my yoke is easy and my burden is light yes I ask you stop trying release now release that burden release that arake release that pressure release that circumstance amen release that worry I know some people oh you know you can't operate sometimes we think we got faith but in that heart you know there's worry there you know there's doubt there you know there's fear there now you're trying to operate in faith and that's an hindrance to Faith and you can't see the miracle advancing because as long as you got that that worry there as long as you got that depression there as long as you got the thought in your heart there Faith can't operate am so you've got to leave it there Hallelujah leave it there take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there the Lord if you trust and never doubt he will surely bring you out take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there let's sing it leave it there leave it there take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there if we trust and never doubt he will surely bring you out take your bir to the Lord and leave it there now when we rest that is showing that we trust Jesus Hallelujah to rest without worry is showing that we trust Jesus yes amen rest equals peace when we are resting we're showing we Shalom rest means that we are quietening our racing thoughts and our worries and our concerns and turning them over to God amen amen Jesus said in John 10:10 now what watch when Jesus gives I was telling you John 10:10 I came that you may have life what kind of Life Jesus and have it abundantly amen he come to give us life look what the thief comes to do steal kill destroy I have come that they may have life and they may have it more abundantly amen amen thank you we can give Jesus the more we give the more he lavishes his love on us well he brought me to his banqueting table His Banner Over Me Is Love he brought me to his banquetting table His Banner Over Me Is Love Hallelujah we can't out give Jesus the more we give the more He blesses us the more we give the more He blesses us amen hallelujah amen amen thank you Lord not only did Jesus promise to save us from our sins and save us he says we can't be effective if we are carrying guilt he came to release us from guilt also you can't live life with the guilt of the past that's right you know what something about the blood of Jesus when he cleanses he makes you as white as snow it says say you've never done it in the first place your past is Forgiven your past is erased amen Jesus doesn't remember it anymore all is asking confess it am release it to me amen you know his strength is made perfect in our weakness so whatever that weak area in your life is God can strengthen it amen amen thank you Lord thank you Lord so knowing that we are forgiven also releases to us our identity you remember the man now I'm closing now the man that was there on the plantation what one weapon did he have he had his identity amen the prophet says that this man knew who he was and even though he was an African slave on the plantation eating the same food as the others sleeping in the same place as the others no unfit given the same work as the others you remember they asked him is he the headed of the others he said no does he eat different no does he sleep do no but what released that authority to him his identity and he carried himself differently I don't care who puts pressure on you when you know who you are you carry yourself out differently it can be your mother your father your brothers your sisters whoever it is your own children you will carry yourself as a son and daughter of a king in spite of the pressure amen thank you 1 Peter 5 amen we're bringing this to a close now he says humble yourselves now that's a good thing to do humble yourselves verse 6 1 pet 5:6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you amen now watch he gives a warning be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walth about seeking whom he may devour remember we just read there now John 10:10 enemy comes to kill steal and destroy there's he walking around now there is one who is the lion of the tribe of Judah amen and this one is as a roaring lion right amen so he's like a mouse in a lion suit amen he says now you must resist whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who had called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ after you have suffered a wife make you perfect establish strengthen settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen amen Matthew 11:28 I'm just giving you the scriptures we already preached it now but I want to give you the scriptures come unto me verse 28 come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I this is I will Covenant now I will amen give you thank you Lord amen praise the Lord praise the lord we just going to leave it there because I want us to get into a time of prayer so the thought of tonight's message was when we know our identity it releases to us our Authority that is why you'll find week after week the ministry coming ministering Brothers coming trying to position you and show you your scripture Revelation 10 revealing your ident identity who you are you know what a powerful people we are he says if the church only realizes who she is that's right she'll be an invincible Army amen there's a sickness though it's called demena that you can know your identity one day and the next day you forgot now we don't want Dementia in the bride amen say Lord take away all spiritual amnesia amen all of this let's Stand Together Church of God Amen brothers and sisters we're going to pray together right come on give him praise give him praise amen he's released to us our identity amen so we can have the authority in the church amen every Exodus there was a followup Ministry thank you Lord Joshua followed Moses the apostles followed Jesus and we follow BR amen what an anointing amen and how if you know Jesus said that it's going to be greater yes Hallelujah Joshua positioning the people in the land was greater than Moses bringing them out yes amen Jesus told the disciples Greater Works and these shall you do the prophet of God says wait until he says watch it then I believe we are positioning ourselves for that right now as a Church of the Living God we are going to take back everything the enemy is even dead to think about yes he's there to think about destroying your family he's there to think about taking your he is's there to think about taking your your job amen your sustenance he's there to attack your family you know when God restores you restore Sevenfold So I'm saying all the enemy has eaten in your life the pal canor cater and Locust everything that he has eaten I declare to you if you can surrender to God and cast your cares upon him he'll restore to you press down shaken together coming over running over lord somebody receive it amen amen you may have left one thing God's going to open up seven more doors amen praise the Lord the Lord says in the Book of Revelation when I open a door no man can shut the Bible says promotion belong to the Lord amen amen so God's going to release something in the Sons and Daughters of God right now who can receive it and walk in obedience amen I don't believe that your encounter your coming here tonight was by chance amen amen because God wants to reveal that you are his son amen and because you to our sons he has sent the spirit of his son which is the Holy Ghost two sons yes what is he telling you he sent you the guide he sent you the teacher because he wants to EMP power his son oh what hey my father I love him so much amen I
