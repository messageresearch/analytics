[8:21] people amen for a day and hour as such
[8:25] as this
[8:27] amen amen
[8:31] the Book of Judges let's turn to the
[8:33] Book of Judges we'll read from the Book
[8:36] of Judges from chapter
[8:43] 13 just for a context we'll start with
[8:46] Judges 13 reading from 1 to
[8:55] 5 and the children of Israel did Evil
[8:59] again in the sight of the
[9:02] Lord and the Lord delivered them into
[9:05] the hand of the Philistines 40
[9:10] years and there was a certain man of
[9:13] Zora of the family of the
[9:16] danites whose name was menoa you know
[9:20] what the symbol of the denit was it was
[9:22] a symbol of the
[9:25] eagle and his wife was Barren and be not
[9:29] and I believe nothing is done by chance
[9:32] I believe she was Barren for a reason
[9:35] because there was a certain time in
[9:37] season
[9:38] only that you would bring forth cuz God
[9:41] works with times and Seasons
[9:43] amen and the angel of the Lord appeared
[9:47] unto the woman and said unto her behold
[9:51] now Thou Art Barren and beareth not but
[9:55] thou shall conceive and bear a son amen
[9:59] now therefore beware I pray thee and
[10:02] drink not wine nor strong drink and eat
[10:06] not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt
[10:09] conceive and bear a son and no razor
[10:13] shall come on his head for the child
[10:15] shall be a Nazarite unto God from the
[10:18] womb and he shall begin to deliver
[10:22] Israel out of the end of the
[10:24] Philistines amen amen we go back now to
[10:29] the Judges chapter
[10:31] 16 reading from verse
[10:37] 23
[10:40] amen you know the we all know the story
[10:42] of Samson right we know the history here
[10:45] but now we see this part is coming
[10:48] now to the end of his lifespan on Earth
[10:53] or he's coming now to his Point of
[10:57] Departure judge 16:23 then the Lords of
[11:01] the Philistines gathered them together
[11:03] for to offer a great sacrifice unto Deon
[11:07] their God and to Rejoice for they said
[11:10] our God had delivered Samson our enemy
[11:13] into our
[11:14] hand and when the people saw him they
[11:18] praised their God for they said our God
[11:21] had delivered into our hands our enemy
[11:24] and the destroyer of our country which
[11:27] slew many of us us you see because when
[11:31] Samson was under the an operating under
[11:34] the anointing of God it was destruction
[11:38] to the Philistines amen amen no
[11:41] Philistine could stand in his way when
[11:43] he was operating under the
[11:46] anointing and they had to send a
[11:48] seducing
[11:49] Spirit to come and make him to penalize
[11:53] his fi to take away what God has given
[11:56] him as a Nazarite vow
[11:59] and then take the anointing away from
[12:02] him and when the people saw him they
[12:06] praised that God but he said our God had
[12:07] delivered into our hand our enemy and
[12:09] the destroyer of our country which slew
[12:12] many of us and it came to pass when the
[12:15] hearts were merry that they said call
[12:17] for Samson that he may make us spot and
[12:21] they call for Samson out of the prison
[12:24] want to make a mockery out of him and he
[12:26] made them spot and they set him
[12:29] between and they set him between the
[12:34] pillars now the pillars are things that
[12:37] holds the
[12:39] building pillars that holds the
[12:42] ideologies pillars are things that are
[12:45] holding the man-made systems together
[12:48] but thank God we received the P of fire
[12:51] in this day amen amen that same P of
[12:54] fire that separated that came as a
[12:56] column separated the children of Israel
[12:58] and and the
[13:00] Egyptians
[13:04] amen and Samson said unto the lad that
[13:07] held him by the hand suffer me that I
[13:11] may feel the pills whereupon the house
[13:14] stand it you see they are building on
[13:17] something that will fall down but our
[13:19] our house is built upon ANS that you
[13:22] cannot be made over here in this land
[13:25] amen that I may lean upon them
[13:29] now the house was full of men and women
[13:32] and all the Lords of the Philistines
[13:35] were there and they were upon the roof
[13:38] about 3,000 men and women so these were
[13:41] all the
[13:42] rulers and all the great people in the
[13:44] philis from the Philistines and they
[13:46] were upon the roof about 3,000 men and
[13:49] women and that be that beheld while
[13:53] Samson made spot and Samson called unto
[13:57] the Lord
[13:59] and said oh Lord
[14:02] God remember me
[14:05] amen now Samson is having a prayer
[14:08] meeting he realized that the anointing
[14:11] had left him and he realized what
[14:13] paralyzed his faith being by giving into
[14:17] the seducing Spirit of
[14:19] theila and realized that paralyzed his
[14:22] faith that he couldn't operate under the
[14:24] anointing any longer and remember this
[14:26] is a time where Samson eyes were taken
[14:30] out amen this is a time when there's no
[14:33] prophet in the
[14:34] land Samson was a judge there was no
[14:37] prophets at that time but yeah remember
[14:40] he was the seven judge of
[14:42] Israel but now we're talking about the
[14:44] time when his eyes is taken out what his
[14:47] eyes is typing the Sea of the age the
[14:49] prophet of the age is of the scene amen
[14:52] Samson's eyes are taken
[14:55] out he said Remember Me watch him now
[15:00] he's coming now prayerfully
[15:02] amen and strengthen me I pray thee only
[15:07] this once oh God that I may be at once
[15:13] avenge of the Philistines of my for my
[15:16] two
[15:18] eyes and Samson took all of the two
[15:22] middle pillars upon which the house
[15:26] stood and on which it was born up so
[15:32] watch is praying now he's is's building
[15:35] his feet muscles now amen
[15:38] amen
[15:40] and Samson took all of the two middle
[15:43] pillars upon which the house stood and
[15:46] on which it was born up of the one with
[15:50] is right and of the other with is
[15:54] left
[15:55] amen and Samson said
[16:00] let me die with the
[16:04] Philistines Samson is willing now to die
[16:08] to himself to sacrifice his life amen
[16:13] because he know this is the hour of the
[16:15] Greater
[16:17] Works and to do the Greater Works from
[16:20] all his
[16:21] ministry he has to sacrifice and die to
[16:24] self
[16:26] amen he has to sacrifice his life yes
[16:31] amen because when he was selfish and
[16:34] given into the desires of the flesh it
[16:37] paralyzed his faith and he lost the
[16:39] anointing
[16:42] yes and he bowed himself with all his
[16:46] might and the house fell down fell upon
[16:49] the Lords and upon all the people that
[16:51] were therein so the dead which he slew
[16:54] at his dead were more than which they
[16:57] slew in his life life amen you may be
[17:06] SE we turn quickly to the Book of Joel
[17:17] 2:23 Joel

[17:24] Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God
[17:28] for he had given you the former rain

[17:53] month is typing in the in the time of
[17:55] Israel was typing the sand right and so
[17:58] so you'll know what happened here Amen
[18:00] in this assembly what God will started
[18:02] doing here in this year amen
[18:08] amen we find and the floow shall be full
[18:12] of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[18:15] wine and
[18:16] oil amen and I will restore to you the
[18:20] years that the Locust had eaten the
[18:22] canker worm and the caterpillar and the
[18:24] pmer worm my great Army which are sent
[18:27] among you and yet they shall eat in
[18:29] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[18:32] name of the Lord your God that dwelt
[18:36] wonderously with you and my people shall
[18:38] never be ashamed and ye shall know that
[18:42] I am in the midst of Israel if you look
[18:45] at that word that I am amen amen amen
[18:51] when Moses asked the Lord what he said I
[18:53] am
[18:57] amen and what did Jesus said to the
[18:59] Pharisees before Moses was I am before
[19:03] Abraham was I
[19:05] am and ye shall know that I am in the
[19:08] midst of Israel and that I am the Lord
[19:12] your God and none else and my people
[19:16] shall never be ashamed
[19:20] amen and it shall come to pass now let's
[19:23] look at that word ashamed the only time
[19:25] you'll ever be ashamed of this gospel is
[19:27] when you received the Holy Ghost amen
[19:30] there was a time where Peter was ashamed
[19:32] to admit that he was with Jesus and
[19:35] there was a time were yet to deny Jesus
[19:38] not once not twice but
[19:40] twice but when the Holy Ghost come
[19:43] down this same Peter now with bolus
[19:46] began to Proclaim this very Jesus that
[19:49] he
[19:50] denied amen so when you receive the Holy
[19:53] Ghost you will not be ashamed to be
[19:55] associated with Jesus and way Jesus now
[19:59] is amongst his people is in his word in
[20:02] the message of the hour amen which is
[20:05] now being manifested in a people because
[20:08] there's a people that's been eating this
[20:09] word and they now receive this word and
[20:12] become a manifestation of this word so
[20:15] where is Jesus in a people
[20:18] hallelujah yes amen so out of the if you
[20:22] don't have the Holy Ghost you will be
[20:24] ashamed to say I'm associated with the
[20:27] message of the hour but if you got the
[20:28] Holy Ghost you will not be ashamed to
[20:31] associated with everything that goes
[20:33] with the message if you're a sister
[20:35] that's having your hair and you're not
[20:37] ashamed because people are picking on
[20:39] your ear you're not ashamed of the type
[20:41] of dressing you wear you're not ashamed
[20:43] because you don't wear lipstick and
[20:44] makeup and you don't wear all the
[20:46] jewelry that they wear you're not
[20:48] ashamed to be associated with the things
[20:50] of
[20:51] God you not that you be ashamed to say I
[20:54] cannot be with you because I'm going to
[20:56] church amen thank you Lord You're not
[20:59] ashamed to say I cannot partake with the
[21:01] things of this world I cannot be
[21:03] associated with you going to nightclubs
[21:05] I cannot be associated with you worldly
[21:07] music I cannot be associated with your
[21:09] gossip I cannot be associated with you
[21:11] while you're drinking because I am a
[21:14] child of
[21:16] God thank you
[21:18] Lord and it shall come to pass afterward
[21:22] that I will pour out my spirit upon All
[21:25] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[21:27] shall prop
[21:28] your old men shall dream dreams and
[21:31] young men shall see visions and also
[21:34] upon the servants and upon the anmat in
[21:36] those days will have pour out my
[21:40] spirit amen we want to speak on this
[21:42] morning the manifestation of the Greater
[21:45] Works just before changing Dimensions
[21:49] amen because that Samson did the Greater
[21:52] Works in the Judgment
[21:54] hour so shall we do the Greater Works in
[21:57] this hour amen just before notice this
[22:02] now just before Samson changed
[22:06] dimensions in other words before because
[22:08] he's going to die right before his death
[22:12] after his death he's going to change
[22:13] Dimensions he going to go to paradise so
[22:15] just before changing Dimensions he
[22:17] produced the Greater Works amen amen
[22:20] amen and just before this bride amen
[22:23] will become the final voice in this
[22:25] final hour just before she changed
[22:28] Dimensions amen from the terrestrial
[22:32] amen from the Earthly to the Heavenly
[22:35] from the terrestrial to the celestial
[22:38] from the Earthly to the Heavenly before
[22:39] she change Dimensions amen from this
[22:43] corruption to incorruption from
[22:45] mortality to immortality she's going to
[22:47] produce the Greater
[22:51] Works amen so you can see when this
[22:53] Greater Works is happening before the
[22:56] changing of dimension
[23:00] amen John 17:23 Jesus says and the glory
[23:04] which thou gavest me I have given them
[23:08] amen that they may be one even as we are
[23:13] one i in
[23:15] them and thou in me that they may be
[23:19] made perfect in one that the world may
[23:23] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[23:26] them as thou has loved
[23:28] me amen so who it is it is Christ in you
[23:32] yes doing the Greater Works amen amen we
[23:36] can do nothing of ourselves it is Christ
[23:39] in US yes but it comes with a
[23:42] sacrifice amen because maybe there was a
[23:46] time when we received this word and the
[23:49] anointing was so strong but there was a
[23:50] time where we may have slipped up there
[23:53] was a time when we went into the
[23:55] world Amen because was caught up with
[23:58] the things of the
[24:00] world
[24:02] Amen and maybe we were caught up with
[24:04] the spirit of the age we become
[24:06] complacent you might say but I'm not
[24:08] sinning I'm not doing the wrong things
[24:09] but I'm talking about being carried away
[24:11] with the age carried away with your
[24:14] career carried away with your work
[24:16] carried away with all kind of things by
[24:18] the things of God spend anything you
[24:21] spend more time with becomes your idol
[24:24] yes amen and maybe we was carried away
[24:26] with that but God has called us in this
[24:28] year amen to come once again to a
[24:31] consecration yes Lord because as long as
[24:34] Samson was under that Nazarite vow he
[24:37] had that anointing he could operate
[24:39] under the anointing
[24:41] amen but when he allowed
[24:44] Thea to cut those Seven Locks from his
[24:48] hair amen which was the Covenant that he
[24:52] had amen he couldn't operate under the
[24:56] anointing
[24:58] and he couldn't couldn't fulfill his
[25:00] commission but now when he realized that
[25:04] his hairs grew again amen the locks grew
[25:07] again then he remembered his Covenant
[25:09] amen amen yes and he when he once he's
[25:12] brought back to the
[25:14] word is bringing back to remembrance

[25:21] he I will Covenant am he said I will

[25:32] blemish amen thank you
[25:38] Lord and you bring you brought to
[25:40] remembrance the Covenant amen you come
[25:43] back to the word and the word is
[25:47] now what is doing it's increasing your
[25:50] fake muscles amen and your fake muscles
[25:53] began to grow and when your muscles
[25:55] began to grow you realize now you are
[25:57] facing the worst enemy because this is
[26:00] the age where Al is Unleashed upon the
[26:02] Earth this is the hour where 200 million
[26:05] demons are on the
[26:07] earth yes trying to make fun of the
[26:10] things of
[26:11] God yeah trying to say that days of
[26:14] Miracle has
[26:16] passed days of Miracles have stopped
[26:18] with the
[26:24] prophets but this is the hour
[26:28] where you will not be ashamed to be
[26:31] associated with the things of God if you
[26:35] are walking in the Supernatural and
[26:37] experiencing the supernatural you'll not
[26:40] be ashamed to speak of the supernatural
[26:43] amen amen you'll not be ashamed to speak
[26:46] of the things that God is doing amongst
[26:48] you yes
[26:50] amen
[26:56] amen
[27:03] now when Samson was there he put his
[27:05] hands upon those posts he stood in
[27:08] between
[27:11] them and the Philistines were
[27:13] celebrating they're having such a big
[27:16] time because that's what these demons
[27:18] are doing they're saying we got this
[27:20] people now we've got them into the
[27:23] word they believe they got the message
[27:25] of the
[27:26] hour don't they don't know that they
[27:29] have to produce the Greater Works we
[27:31] stop them from doing that that's what
[27:34] that's what the demons are thinking
[27:37] now these demons have been thinking all
[27:40] these years we've got them to believe
[27:42] that they are settled in the
[27:44] message and then we receive a whole lot
[27:46] of message and message and
[27:52] message but not knowing how to operate
[27:54] the
[27:55] message amen amen
[28:01] imagine you studying to be a doctor and
[28:03] you just studying all the theory but
[28:05] you're not doing the Practical part of
[28:07] it amen they don't do any good right you
[28:10] all know how to take your hands and use
[28:11] your hands with those
[28:13] instruments amen amen but the Bible said
[28:16] the sign shall follow them that believe
[28:18] amen we are a commissioned people yes
[28:21] Lord amen
[28:23] amen oh yes Lord and we are Jesus said
[28:28] Greater Works than these ye shall
[28:32] do now if there's a oness between Jesus
[28:35] said father I pray that they be one even
[28:37] as we are one if there is a Oneness
[28:40] between us and Christ then it must be
[28:42] the same Works yes because it's not us
[28:45] doing the works it's Christ in us and
[28:48] Christ has to do the same thing all the
[28:50] time because is the same yesterday today
[28:53] and forever amen oh yes thank you Lord
[28:58] so these people were making a mockery
[29:00] out of Samson because they know they
[29:03] took his eyes
[29:06] away but what they didn't realize when
[29:09] the prophet was off the scene and the
[29:11] eyes was taken away it was the hour for
[29:13] the Greater
[29:14] Works God preserved him when the message
[29:18] was being preached when the prophet was
[29:20] here under the anointing and those
[29:22] demons couldn't take it there's a time
[29:24] when the prophet had to be taken off the
[29:26] scene because the demons could
[29:30] analy but there was a people being
[29:34] preserved that's why the message was
[29:36] stor up he was preaching to a
[29:38] Pentecostal bunch of denominations it
[29:40] wasn't for them they wouldn't be able to
[29:44] digest it but there was an hour coming
[29:46] where there was a people that was going
[29:48] to receive this word amen and it was
[29:51] going to take the five for Ministry that
[29:53] was going to shed light on the same word
[29:55] that was Tau up amen
[29:58] amen so Satan thought he's got he's got
[30:03] them because now there's no Prophet on
[30:05] the
[30:06] scene there's no works on the scene
[30:10] there's no manifestation of Jesus Christ
[30:12] on the scene and while that is happening
[30:14] you got all the quits going
[30:19] around and nothing is happening amongst
[30:22] the bride but Satan was
[30:24] happy but he didn't realize
[30:28] that nothing is out of season with
[30:30] God God is in control of all things in
[30:35] you at an appointed time an appointed
[30:38] season he's going to have a people that
[30:41] will receive this word not only will
[30:44] they receive this word they will
[30:47] Manifest this word and know how to
[30:49] operate this word because he said I'll
[30:52] run ride this Trail
[30:54] again amen I'll ride this Trail again
[30:58] the Covenant remains yes it takes the
[31:01] Holy Ghost who still comes back Amen to
[31:04] bring the same word to
[31:09] lights and
[31:11] here the Philistines were making fun of
[31:14] Samson and his 200 million demons upon
[31:17] the Earth were going on a
[31:20] rampage but there's a people are that
[31:22] are rising up amen that began to pray
[31:27] amen that come back to get consecrated
[31:30] to God that come back to the altar amen
[31:34] that come back with consecrated lives
[31:37] amen yes Lord realizing that they must
[31:39] produce those virtues to come to the
[31:42] stature of a perfect man realizing to do
[31:45] that they're now entitled to receive
[31:47] amen what was there contained in your
[31:49] seven tunders because it will be those S
[31:53] those Mis divinely revealed truths that
[31:56] will literally turn turn our heart back
[31:58] to the faith of the
[32:00] fathers amen and if the our faith is
[32:04] turned back to the father then it must
[32:06] produce the same Works yes amen that's
[32:09] right must produce another book of Acts
[32:14] amen Satan thought he had everything
[32:16] under his
[32:18] control but there coming an hour and the
[32:21] hour is
[32:23] now where the
[32:25] demons must be dealt with decisively
[32:28] amen amen yes this is a time of War amen
[32:32] this is a time of spiritual warfare am
[32:36] amen and Samson he began to put his
[32:39] hands upon those
[32:41] posts and while all the demons are
[32:43] celebrating the Philistines were
[32:46] celebrating he begin to think God is
