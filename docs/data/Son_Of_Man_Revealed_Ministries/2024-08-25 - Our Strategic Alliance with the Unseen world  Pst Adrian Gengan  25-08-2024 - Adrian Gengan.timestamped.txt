[19:57] how many of you can see the spirit of
[19:59] God moving amen with Mighty signs
[20:01] Miracles and wonders amen and how is
[20:04] that coming out through the revelation
[20:05] of the word we are using the word amen
[20:08] as our basis because there's no
[20:10] prophetic gift on the earth now so we
[20:12] can't go to a prophet for visions and
[20:15] and all of those things amen but the
[20:17] word is the absolute the prophet teaches
[20:19] us that gifts are secondary things but
[20:22] the Bible is the principal theme amen
[20:24] the Bible is the absolute if we can
[20:26] apply the word by faith we must see the
[20:28] same results amen so we are thankful
[20:31] amen hallelujah for what the Lord is
[20:32] doing in our lives amen and all of his
[20:35] movings amongst the Church of God Amen
[20:38] praise the Lord amen you appreciate the
[20:40] song I enjoy that song Adore amen
[20:42] hallelujah thank you at Le I know I'm
[20:45] next in line who she
[20:47] adors praise the Lord but that was sung
[20:49] beautifully this morning we pray the
[20:51] Lord will continue to bless us to car
[20:53] amen hallelujah let's turn to our Bibles
[20:55] this morning praise the Lord
[20:59] we're continuing with our thought we
[21:01] were dealing with
[21:03] adoption amen amen we were dealing with
[21:06] so many aspects of adoption showing you
[21:08] how even in the message of the hour you
[21:10] can remain a son and not go on to
[21:13] adoption amen and adoption requires
[21:16] certain things to be in place and we
[21:18] showed you how you need to be put under
[21:20] a guide under a teacher that's what the
[21:23] Hebrews did amen they put the son under
[21:25] a tutor and a guide and we know the
[21:27] guide that was sent to us was the great
[21:29] holy spirit amen amen
[21:32] hallelujah and we showed you that this
[21:34] every teacher must have a syllabus and
[21:37] that syllabus was conduct order and the
[21:39] doctrine that the prophet reestablished
[21:42] in the church C because that's when he's
[21:45] coming to give an account to the father
[21:47] now he must base you on something so the
[21:50] conduct order and Doctrine is what he's
[21:52] going to give a report to the father
[21:54] about amen hallelujah and we were
[21:56] showing you heart that when a son is now
[21:58] position placed he now possesses all the
[22:00] authority of the father so that he can
[22:03] go out now oh yes and enlarge his
[22:06] territory amen therefore the spirit took
[22:08] us into this realm now once you come
[22:10] into adoption you've got to open up
[22:13] spiritual Frontiers amen for the kingdom
[22:15] of God we must Advance the kingdom of
[22:17] God at this time so this morning I'll
[22:19] speak on the opening of of spiritual
[22:21] Frontiers and our strategic alliance
[22:24] with the Unseen World amen every Army
[22:27] that goes out into battle must form
[22:28] strategic
[22:30] alliances and we are formed an alliance
[22:32] with the Unseen World amen so I want you
[22:35] to know that the Unseen World is more
[22:37] real yes amen than what we contact with
[22:41] these five senses
[22:43] hallelujah amen and how do we connect
[22:45] with that Unseen World Faith connects us
[22:48] to that unseen spiritual realm the
[22:50] Heavenly places the high dimensions of
[22:53] the Holy Ghost amen so we'll turn to 1
[22:57] Chronicles chap 4 this is where we
[22:59] initially got our inspiration from I
[23:01] just want to read that as a
[23:04] backing 1 Chronicles chapter 4 and we'll
[23:07] read from verse
[23:09] 9 now what we are reading is jabz and
[23:11] jabz is coming from the tribe of
[23:15] Judah
[23:18] Hallelujah jabz was a son of Judah a
[23:22] descendant of Judah
[23:28] and Jaz was more honorable than his
[23:34] Brethren and his mother called him is
[23:37] nam jabz now pay attention to that
[23:39] because what we are taught is that the
[23:42] Hebrew mothers in giving child birth
[23:44] they would call the name of the
[23:46] son everybody remember the prophet
[23:48] teaching us there they would call the
[23:50] name of the son in child birth and
[23:52] according to how the mother called a
[23:54] name when Joshua was placing them in the
[23:56] land he placed them in the right right
[23:58] place amen so each one was going to get
[24:01] a portion of the
[24:03] inheritance hallelujah
[24:05] amen and his mother called his name jabz
[24:08] saying because I bear him with sorrow
[24:11] and jabz called on the god of Israel
[24:14] saying oh that thou wouldest bless me
[24:17] indeed and enlarge my Coast yes that's
[24:20] my border my territory and that thine
[24:23] hand might be with me and thou wouldest
[24:26] Keep Me From Evil amen
[24:28] that it may not grieve me and God
[24:31] granted him that which he
[24:35] requested amen amen our heavenly father
[24:38] amen we'll get back to that now I want
[24:40] to go to 2 Kings chapter 6 verse1 15
[24:44] amen our strategic alliance with the
[24:47] Unseen
[24:50] World 2 Kings chapter 6 and verse1
[24:54] 15 and when the servant of the man of
[24:57] God was risen early
[24:59] and gone
[25:00] forth behold an
[25:02] host Compass the city both with horses
[25:06] and
[25:07] chariots yes physical horses and
[25:10] chariots now when do they come in the
[25:13] night time Satan will always try and
[25:15] work in
[25:16] darkness to take you
[25:19] unawares so when they awoke early in the
[25:21] morning they see the city surrounded
[25:23] with chariots horses and chariots and
[25:27] his servant said unto him this is now
[25:29] talking to Elisha alas my master how
[25:33] shall we
[25:35] do and he answered fear not for they
[25:39] that be with us are more than they that
[25:41] be with them amen amen but physically if
[25:45] you're looking with the five senses you
[25:47] can't see this all you see you are
[25:51] surrounded and Elisha prayed and said
[25:54] Lord I pray thee open his eyes
[25:58] that he may see I want him to see what I
[26:01] am seeing amen but we thank God we've
[26:04] had a the amen the fourth Elijah year
[26:06] that took us into that spiritual realm
[26:08] so that we can see what he saw the
[26:11] opening up of spiritual Frontiers for us
[26:13] amen and the Lord opened the eyes of the
[26:16] young man and he saw and behold the
[26:18] mountain was full of horses and Chariots
[26:21] of Fire round about Elisha amen thank
[26:25] you Lord and when they came down to him
[26:27] Elisha prayed unto the Lord and said
[26:30] Smite these people I pray thee with
[26:32] blindness and he smoke them with
[26:34] blindness according to the word of
[26:36] Elisha amen hallelujah one more uh maybe
[26:40] just few more portions we're going to
[26:42] read here I just want to get to it
[26:43] Genesis 32 And1 you can be seated amen
[26:45] we'll continue to read
[26:48] Hallelujah Genesis 32
[26:50] And1 Jacob is on his way now to find him
[26:54] his mother told him and his father told
[26:55] him to go and take a wife from his own
[26:57] people so Jacob is on his way but I want
[27:00] you to notice something this is before
[27:02] he meets the angel on the ladder before
[27:05] he wrestles with the angel his first
[27:07] encounter Genesis 32 And1 and Jacob went
[27:11] on his way and the angels of God met him
[27:15] amen and when Jacob saw them he said
[27:18] this is God's host amen amen this is Who
[27:21] David was talking about am amen you
[27:24] defile the armies of the Living God yes
[27:27] he wasn't concentrating on the the the
[27:29] Philistines that were shaking in their
[27:32] boots but gol was defying the armies of
[27:35] the Living God this is the house that
[27:38] he's talking about Jacob met this Host
[27:41] this is God's host amen Joshua 5:13 I'm
[27:46] laying the scriptures down you can make
[27:48] note of it and ponder it I'm trying to
[27:50] show you there's an Unseen
[27:52] [Music]
[27:53] World amen hallelujah and we are not
[27:57] going to amen be able to fight the
[27:59] battles on our own yes in the flesh
[28:03] there's got to be a strategic Alliance
[28:06] to connect with the Unseen World amen
[28:09] and I'm happy to announce that the
[28:10] message of the hour came to connect us
[28:12] with the Unseen
[28:15] World Joshua 5:3 and it came to pass
[28:20] when Joshua was by Jericho that he
[28:22] lifted up his eyes and looked and behold
[28:24] there stood a man over against him with
[28:27] a sword dra drawn in his hand and Joshua
[28:30] went unto him and said unto him at thou
[28:33] for us or for our
[28:36] adversaries and he said nay but as the
[28:38] captain of the host of the Lord am I now
[28:41] come amen so the host said Jacob M has a
[28:46] captain and it's the Lord himself amen
[28:49] amen he's the captain of the host and
[28:52] Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and
[28:54] did worship and he said unto him what
[28:56] sayth my Lord unto his son servant and
[28:58] the captain of the Lord's old said unto
[29:00] Joshua loose thy
[29:03] shoe from off thy foot for the place
[29:06] where on thou stand us is Holy and
[29:08] Joshua did so amen now Joshua would have
[29:11] known that Moses had the same encounter
[29:13] the same Angel of the Lord that was in
[29:15] the burning
[29:16] bush one more portion of scripture here
[29:19] in Acts chapter
[29:21] 27 coming to the New
[29:24] Testament Paul is now on a ship the ship
[29:28] he's heading to be
[29:30] Shipwrecked there's a storm on the
[29:33] sea and I want you to notice that Paul
[29:36] spoke to them and told them amen that
[29:40] they shouldn't have loosed from a
[29:42] certain city but they didn't listen to
[29:43] him so he gave them a prophetic word and
[29:46] they didn't
[29:48] listen and notice this part but after
[29:50] long absence abstinence Paul stood in
[29:53] the midst of them so Paul went into a
[29:56] time of consecration amen he abstained
[30:00] himself stood in forth in the midst of
[30:03] them and said s you should have arken
[30:05] unto me and not have lose from creit and
[30:08] to have gained this arm and loss and now
[30:11] I exal you to be of good cheer for there
[30:14] shall be no loss of any man's life among
[30:16] you but of the
[30:18] ship why for they stood by me this night
[30:21] the angel of God Amen who I am and whom
[30:25] I
[30:26] serve saying fear not Paul thou must be
[30:30] brought before Caesar and lo God had
[30:32] given thee all them that sail with thee
[30:35] wherefore s be of good cheer for I
[30:38] believe God that it shall be even as it
[30:40] was told me amen praise the Lord the
[30:42] Lord had blessings to the reading of his
[30:44] word amen amen so just reading those
[30:48] scriptures
[30:49] alone will make us see that there's
[30:51] definitely an Unseen World yes amen
[30:54] praise the Lord
[30:56] yes amen
[30:59] to go back to our opening scripture and
[31:02] just put some remarks
[31:04] there here is
[31:06] jaes and every
[31:09] son every son of Jacob had an
[31:13] inheritance the 12 tribes were camped in
[31:15] the land everybody agree amen everyone
[31:18] was given a portion of
[31:22] inheritance and I want you to know that
[31:24] jabz was given a portion of inheritance
[31:28] but jabz was not a lazy
[31:31] man jabz was given a small portion of
[31:37] territory and I want you to know Jaz was
[31:40] not being envious of other people's
[31:43] inheritance neither was he looking with
[31:46] lust yes
[31:49] amen because God doesn't reward the
[31:53] lazy yes God rewards those who put their
[31:56] hands to work amen and he will bless the
[31:59] works of the
[32:00] hand so I believe jabz worked every inch
[32:03] of
[32:04] ground hallelujah
[32:06] amen if he was given this land
[32:11] here he walked every inch of
[32:14] ground he walked it into the
[32:17] borders yes amen until he said
[32:22] Lord I have potential oh yes I am a man
[32:26] of vision amen Lord won't you enlarge my
[32:29] territory amen yes Lord give me a
[32:32] greater portion amen amen hallelujah I'm
[32:35] telling you don't be satisfied with a
[32:37] portion that's been allotted to you the
[32:39] message of the hour has come amen so
[32:41] that you can advance the kingdom of God
[32:43] you can open up spiritual territories in
[32:45] your own life don't be satisfied with
[32:48] your present spiritual condition amen
[32:51] amen you can open up spiritual Frontiers
[32:53] even in your own life amen there is more
[32:57] of God that we can yes sir take in we if
[33:01] we empty out ourselves there's more of
[33:03] the Holy Spirit yes Lord amen so jabz
[33:07] must have walked every inch of ground
[33:09] until he had a dream and a vision in the
[33:12] back part of his mind and he said this
[33:14] portion that I have now I can't fulfill
[33:16] what's in my
[33:18] mind but Lord if you enlarge my
[33:20] territory oh yes amen I'm asking you to
[33:22] be a man of vision to be a woman of
[33:25] vision oh yes amen God can en your
[33:28] territory amen hallelujah God can
[33:31] enlarge your portion oh yes and he
[33:33] didn't only say that he said you would
[33:35] bless me indeed enlarge my coast and
[33:38] that thine hand might be with me you see
[33:41] if you if you grew up a certain way
[33:43] maybe you came up in a certain household
[33:45] you don't have to remain that way oh yes
[33:47] amen God has given you the potential to
[33:49] put your hand to work God don't call the
[33:51] LA Hallelujah when God called his 12
[33:54] disciples Peter was a fisherman Andrew
[33:56] was a fisherman the amen Matthew was a
[33:58] tax collector God calls those that are
[34:01] at work already people who are not lazy
[34:04] people they can use in his kingdom yes
[34:06] Amen in fact matter of fact Jesus saw
[34:09] one time he's talking about a parable
[34:11] here and he's telling that he saw some
[34:13] people laying Idol Jesus don't like idle
[34:15] people Amen in the 11th hour he told
[34:18] them why don't you also go work in the
[34:20] field why are you standing your Idol
[34:22] Hallelujah maybe it's a closing scenes
[34:24] of the Gentile dispensation and you
[34:26] haven't put your to the plow I'm ask you
[34:29] don't stand idle in the kingdom of God
[34:31] get to work amen for the kingdom of
[34:34] God Amen and Jesus rewards you when you
[34:38] put your hand to work because they
[34:39] receive the same reward as the one who
[34:42] went in the first hour of the day yes
[34:44] amen hallelujah am so God rewards it in
[34:47] fact when he created his first son Adam
[34:50] he put him in a garden before he gave
[34:51] him a wife he told him to work the
[34:53] garden
[34:55] amen amen
[34:58] so God wants us to be accountable in
[35:01] fact that's a principle in God's kingdom
[35:03] the one to whom he gave
[35:05] talents he rewarded those that went and
[35:08] invested it and worked it and brought a
[35:11] return back amen Jesus even took from
[35:14] one and he gave to the one that had a
[35:15] higher return and the one that hid it in
[35:18] the ground the one that did nothing with
[35:20] it Jesus said you are cast out of the
[35:22] Kingdom amen praise the Lord so I'm
[35:26] asking you this which narative of the
[35:28] message of the hour that we have in the
[35:30] form of the opening of the word what are
[35:32] we doing with it are we bringing
[35:34] multiplication to it are we enlarging
[35:36] our territories with it or are we using
[35:38] it for knowledge are we using it to say
[35:41] we are part of the message we are saved
[35:43] no God has called us into a battle God
[35:45] has called us into a fight in this hour
[35:47] amen it's a great Showdown it's the
[35:49] Mount Zion Showdown hallelujah praise
[35:53] the Lord
[35:55] amen now in this Unseen World in this
[35:58] unseen realm there exist things that
[36:02] this eye can't see if we read the second
[36:05] Kings chapter 6 you'll see how did men
[36:09] design
[36:11] chariots because they were spiritual
[36:13] chariots in God's kingdom God has horses
[36:16] in his kingdom amen yes right now don't
[36:20] be like the man who was trying to
[36:21] dispute with the prophet now and say h
[36:23] there was no there's no horses in heaven
[36:25] right because he took him through the
[36:27] Bible and he showed him amen he took him
[36:29] to this scripture as well he even wrote
[36:30] him a letter he said I'm surprised a man
[36:33] of your fine standing would be ignorant
[36:36] in these things the prophet tells us
[36:38] what letter he wrote to him and he says
[36:40] in the book of Kings they are
[36:43] chariots that you and I can't see amen
[36:47] hallelujah they are horses yeah that you
[36:49] and I can't see and I don't many if you
[36:52] know that horses and chariots are for
[36:53] are for transportation so somebody is
[36:55] riding that horse and chariots amen oh
[36:59] yes yes it's an Angelic host he says all
[37:03] around this building right now even here
[37:05] along these aisles and the shares and
[37:06] everything there's Angelic beings right
[37:08] here now to connect with your
[37:12] faith praise the Lord
[37:16] amen amen so in the Kingdom of God in
[37:19] this Unseen World they are angels they
[37:21] are chariots You Are Not
[37:23] Alone everywhere you go you are not
[37:25] alone if you're a son and daughter of
[37:27] God position now for the adoption You
[37:29] Are Not
[37:30] Alone angels are ministering Spirits
[37:33] Hebrews 4
[37:34] Says angels are ministering spirits to
[37:37] the hirs of Salvation amen amen Angels
[37:41] Have Always Been Messengers that carry
[37:43] messenges from the Heavenly realm and
[37:45] brings it to the Earth can you say Amen
[37:47] to that amen amen you are not to bow
[37:49] down to Angels you are not to worship
[37:52] angels angels are here to serve you the
[37:54] prophet of God says sons are higher than
[37:57] Serv and he says angels and servants and
[37:59] Sons and Daughters of God hold a higher
[38:02] rank and Authority amen
[38:05] yes praise the Lord amen in fact you
[38:08] would get excited if you see an angel
[38:10] right now but I want you to know the
[38:13] angels are excited to be in the presence
[38:15] of a son and a daughter of God somebody
[38:17] give God praise come on
[38:19] now we can't be in a backing condition
[38:22] amen we've got to know what the
[38:24] scripture says about us we've got to
[38:26] know our position
[38:27] how can we be HS of the fathers joint
[38:30] ears with the son children of his
[38:32] kingdom and we think that angels are
[38:35] higher than
[38:36] us no you hold Authority you owe power
[38:42] in fact on the earth now you hold the
[38:44] word of God Amen you because you were
[38:46] given dominion over the Earth Psalm 115
[38:49] says amen the heavens belong to the Lord
[38:51] but the Earth as he given to Children of
[38:54] Men yes amen God won't do anything on
[38:56] the Earth except he connects with a man
[38:59] you tell me it's not so show me in the
[39:01] Bible God did something on the earth
[39:03] without connecting with a man on the
[39:05] earth he connected with Abraham he
[39:07] connected with Enoch he connected with
[39:09] Noah he connected amen with every son
[39:11] and daughter of
[39:13] God so if God's going to do anything in
[39:15] this hour he's got to connect with a son
[39:18] and daughter of God because man has the
[39:20] legal Authority on the earth amen praise
[39:24] the Lord we've been through all of this
[39:26] amen I'm just preaching it now amen
[39:29] hallelujah so we find here if we if we
[39:32] starting out we can see here that Adam
[39:36] had close fellowship with God and there
[39:39] can be no higher Unseen World than the
[39:41] realm of God the highest Authority in
[39:44] the Unseen realm is God
[39:46] Almighty so he had fellowship with this
[39:49] Unseen World I'm afraid that in our
[39:52] natural life this is not taught to us
[39:54] from
[39:55] birth Because by the time we come to the
[39:57] age of accountability we are already in
[40:00] school learning other things yeah but we
[40:03] are not taught son daughter you may
[40:05] exist in this life with your five senses
[40:07] and you're contacting through sight
[40:09] through hearing through touching to
[40:11] feeling but there's an Unseen World all
[40:13] around us there's God and the angels of
[40:15] God that are here not only are the the
[40:18] angels that have not Fallen but they are
[40:20] also fallen angels that will try to
[40:22] influence you that's
[40:24] right this needs to be taught to our
[40:27] young people people yes this needs to be
[40:28] taught to us more what I'm trying to do
[40:31] now is trying to iten our sins amen try
[40:34] to iten our sensitivity to the spirit
[40:38] realm amen because we walk not after the
[40:40] flesh but we walk after the spirit that
[40:43] can't just be a saying amen that just
[40:46] can't be a Bible verse that we repeat we
[40:48] must be walking after the spirit because
[40:51] sons of God are led by the spirit of
[40:55] God hallelujah
[40:58] so hadam had close Fellowship he had a
[41:00] close association with God and the
[41:02] Angelic world just because you don't
[41:04] read things in the
[41:06] Bible doesn't mean it isn't
[41:09] so amen angels are messengers from God
[41:12] carrying word back and forth
[41:15] amen it can't be that fallen so if
[41:18] you're saying it's not so I'm going to
[41:20] prove you wrong right now how come in
[41:22] the Garden of Eden the fallen
[41:26] angels can speak to
[41:30] Eve you accept the fact that fallen
[41:32] angels can speak to Eve can possess the
[41:36] serpent and try and influence him how
[41:39] about the angels of God
[41:41] amen amen amen praise the
[41:46] Lord so it can't be that fallen angels
[41:49] can walk in the serpent yet angel that
[41:51] stood with Michael and resisted the lies
[41:53] of the enemy could not be in contact
[41:55] with Adam
[41:57] the angel of God because why the Psalms
[42:00] tell us the angel of God encamped around
[42:03] them that fear Him amen and he will
[42:05] deliver them amen and I believe the man
[42:08] who feared God the most was Adam so the
[42:11] angel of the Lord had to be with
[42:15] him praise the Lord let's just get our
[42:18] first quote there and see what the
[42:19] prophet of God is saying I'll show you
[42:21] now what the prophet is saying and then
[42:23] you can maybe believe me Hallelujah I
[42:25] want you to know even right now you are
[42:27] being influenced from two
[42:29] Realms in the Unseen World right now
[42:31] there's a demonic influence trying to
[42:33] influence you but there's a spirit of
[42:34] God also trying to pull you
[42:37] amen so you decide whose side you want
[42:39] to be on this
[42:41] morning amen if you're on God's side you
[42:43] say Amen to the word of God don't let
[42:46] any Spirits hang around you amen you
[42:48] know what the prophet of God says about
[42:49] spirits hanging around they may not be
[42:52] in you but they hang around you they
[42:54] stifle your praise they stifle your
[42:55] worship he says when God raised up
[42:58] spread from his hands and made the world
[43:00] and created the heavens and earth and
[43:02] made man done all things in his great
[43:04] plan of miraculous the life of God was
[43:07] in man amen hallelujah
[43:11] amen amen man believed in the
[43:14] Supernatural yes but sin separated him
[43:18] so Man became unconscious of the
[43:20] supernatural
[43:21] world Amen israels as it was got clogged
[43:25] up right to stop the flow of the
[43:28] supernatural after the fall there come a
[43:31] time now this is the next quote in
[43:33] conference with God watch now I'm going
[43:35] to prove my point about angels being in
[43:37] the Garden of Eden there come a time in
[43:39] God's Great economy where there had to
[43:41] be a Conference held and the first one
[43:43] that I can call off for this Earth was
[43:46] in the Garden of Eden when the angels of
[43:49] God came home weeping saying your child
[43:52] has
[43:54] fallen they were carrying report back to
[43:56] the father yeah your child has fallen he
[44:00] sinned he's broken your commandment
[44:02] something has to be done the creature of
[44:05] God has fallen from grace and was
[44:07] subject unto Eternal separation from the
[44:09] presence of his God and His maker so my
[44:12] point is from the beginning of time man
[44:15] has always had an encounter with the
[44:17] Unseen World yes
[44:20] yes in fact Adam was a man who operated
[44:24] with six senses
[44:27] amen yes amen he was a man of Faith amen
[44:33] hallelujah the reason why he was amen
[44:36] able to operate like a god man on the
[44:38] earth he was operating through the realm
[44:40] of Faith
[44:42] amen amen faith is the master of all
[44:45] circumstances therefore he could speak
[44:47] to the mountain amen he could speak to
[44:49] the trees he could speak to the
[44:53] winds that was Adam's greatest sense
[44:56] yeah more than the natural senses praise
[44:59] the Lord amen so we are finding here
[45:03] there was
[45:05] contact and as we approaching the end of
[45:07] the Gentile dispensation how many of you
[45:09] believe we approaching now amen all
[45:11] things are fixed right now amen every
[45:14] government is in place amen demon powers
[45:17] are in place religions are in place amen
[45:19] and the Bride of Jesus Christ is in a
[45:21] place yes amen
[45:27] so as we approaching the end of the
[45:28] Gentile
[45:29] dispensation we should becoming more
[45:32] aware and connected with the supernal
[45:35] world Amen with the Anan world this
[45:38] ought to be evident in our daily
[45:41] lives amen I want to heighten your
[45:44] senses this
[45:45] morning and make you walk after the
[45:48] spirit and not after the
[45:52] flesh because in the flesh there's
[45:54] condemnation of
[45:55] sin but Romans tells us that there's no
[45:59] condemnation to those who walk after the
[46:01] spirit amen and not after the flesh yes
[46:04] amen praise the Lord so we are coming
[46:08] more aware more connected with the
[46:09] Unseen World we know how to connect with
[46:11] them we know how to amen move ahead we
[46:14] know how to conquer territories we know
[46:16] amen how to
[46:17] commission praise the Lord now this is
[46:20] going to take Revelation 10:11 now
[46:23] because under your prophecies is how you
[46:25] operating yeah
[46:27] yeah it's under your prophesy again thou
[46:31] must prophesy again that you are able
[46:34] now to take control of the spiritual
[46:36] realm ah come on now your prophecy is
[46:39] just not a casual prophecy right your
[46:42] prophecy is a God man back on the earth
[46:44] you got titled deep back on the earth
[46:46] you are able to speak to the seen world
[46:48] and the Unseen
[46:51] World
[46:52] amen praise the lord we know what we're
[46:54] talking about right amen amen just the
[46:57] last week you see how God raised up
[46:58] Moses Chetty amen Tak him from the gates
[47:01] of death you've seen how God touches to
[47:04] Victory amen sister Victory here let's
[47:05] give the Lord a good ank of Praise amen
[47:08] they said she had a heart attack amen
[47:10] they were doing further test amen
[47:12] probably have admitted her and done some
[47:13] work on her but then the Unseen World
[47:15] came into Play
[47:17] Hallelujah yes praise the
[47:20] Lord you are brother Caleb some of you
[47:22] want your wedes day brother Caleb's
[47:23] testimony he's sitting in the service
[47:26] while the songs being sung and he can't
[47:29] he can't praise the Lord because he's
[47:30] got a
[47:32] problem he can't
[47:34] worship and while the preaching amen
[47:37] he's testimony now while the preaching
[47:40] is going forth yes Lord the word of God
[47:43] says you can ask speak now amen praise
[47:46] the Lord and he says while Peter yet
[47:47] speak now he's applying the scripture
[47:49] while Peter yet spake oh yes he says
[47:52] while the preaching was going on I said
[47:54] speak now and he said he spoke and that
[47:57] thing left him immediately amen praise
[47:59] the Lord amen what is that the
[48:02] supernatural presence of God yes Lord
[48:06] amen we're not here to play amen we're
[48:07] not here to play Church we're here to
[48:09] prepare people for the rapture we are
[48:11] here to take Sons and Daughters of God
[48:13] and put them in an adoption
[48:15] ceremony amen
[48:18] hallelujah amen so our sensors must be
[48:21] item at this time we've got to
[48:22] understand how Angels work we've got to
[48:24] understand how the Angelic World works
[48:26] how the supernatural World Works how to
[48:29] tear down demon powers yes amen you've
[48:31] got to be a master killing demons amen
[48:35] oh yes Lord yes Lord you've got to be a
[48:38] master binding them and casting them out
[48:41] amen praise the
[48:46] Lord so our fight is
[48:48] not our fight is not without spiritual
[48:52] Supernatural assistance is what I'm
[48:53] trying to tell you Heavenly beings have
[48:55] come down to connect with sons of God
[48:57] and that's how what activates Romans
[49:00] 8:19 the manifestation of the sons of
[49:02] God so I say we have been sensitized to
[49:05] this natural life and we have been
[49:07] desensitized to the supernatural
[49:09] world Amen
[49:13] Hallelujah so sons of God like we saying
[49:16] let's go to the next quote now I want to
[49:18] show you this because in each and every
[49:20] one of our Lives we've got to look for
[49:22] this the prophet of God said it I
[49:26] believe it amen and that settles it yes
[49:29] you can tell me that an angel won't come
[49:30] to you I'm believing that an angel will
[49:32] come to you yes
[49:34] amen he says when when a man proves and
[49:37] God loves him he takes him out somewhere
[49:40] to
[49:41] himself there in the front of
[49:45] angels he does something for him he
[49:48] lifts him up there in the presence of
[49:49] God and gives him and fills him and sets
[49:54] him out amen that's the age that we are
[49:56] living in
[49:58] amen amen yes amen remember for your
[50:03] adoption ceremony now it has to be in a
[50:05] public place sir
[50:08] Hallelujah he's going to put his
[50:11] robe his word on you yes he's going to
[50:14] give you the authority the same signing
[50:16] Powers as the father he says you can
[50:18] fire who you fire hire who you
[50:22] hire all authority is given to you when
[50:25] you're an adopted son
[50:27] that was in the message what was the
[50:28] Holy Ghost given for now in the message
[50:31] he you him watch now very
[50:34] important he's talking about Jesus and
[50:36] I'm just doing this for those of you
[50:38] that don't know how Jesus adoption
[50:41] ceremony was you see Jesus had proven to
[50:44] God that he'd been the right kind of son
[50:46] and God took him up on top of the
[50:48] mountain brought Witnesses out there
[50:50] Heavenly Witnesses and Earthly Witnesses
[50:53] and he clothe him in
[50:55] immortality yes yes yes when they looked
[50:57] up they said his garments shined like
[50:59] the sun a supernatural something taking
[51:03] place his garments glisten like the sun
[51:05] in its middle of this day as white as it
[51:09] could be God placed on him that robe of
[51:12] immortality showing that he had received
[51:14] him now you know what happened in the
[51:18] woods it just connected
[51:20] now amen you know the prophet turned
[51:23] young in the woods he says the deer came
[51:25] ate from his hand amen that just
[51:28] connected now that's the reason why God
[51:31] was putting the robe of immortality on
[51:33] the prophet am showing that he had
[51:35] received him oh that's
[51:40] powerful that's the thing that God will
[51:42] do to his sons I pay everyone's
[51:45] listening to this now listen to what
[51:47] he's saying that's the thing God will do
[51:49] to his sons here on Earth someday yes
[51:54] amen right he will call you a son
[51:57] church if you'll only obey him now
[51:59] wasn't that the word beginning of the
[52:00] year if you follow the instruction you
[52:03] shall see the glory of God and what
[52:05] we've learned through the month is the
[52:07] glory is in the Shak the glory is in the
[52:10] holiest of holies that's where the
[52:13] adoption ceremony takes place so if you
[52:16] follow if you obey him and stay on the
[52:17] word and believe it he will place you
[52:19] into the church before the coming of
[52:22] Jesus Christ amen ah some people don't
[52:24] want to surrender to the Lord amen
[52:26] they're saying oh Lord one day you'll
[52:28] come and you'll adopt me what is he
[52:29] saying here before the coming hello am
[52:33] come on
[52:34] now let me prove it to
[52:37] you amen Jesus got filled with the
[52:41] spirit at the Jordan yeah that we can
[52:43] call his
[52:44] birth right because we know the Holy
[52:47] Spirit comes for two things according to
[52:48] the prophet he comes to birth you and
[52:51] then he comes for the adoption ceremony
[52:52] amen so Jesus at the Jordan we can call
[52:55] that the birth amen then in Matthew chap
[52:58] 17 it his adoption
[53:00] ceremony but was that before Jesus
[53:03] died and rose
[53:05] again
[53:07] yes it was before Jesus died and rose
[53:10] again before he came back in a glorified
[53:13] body so I am telling you this is going
[53:15] to happen to you amen before Jesus comes
[53:18] according to this quote
[53:23] am oh somebody connect now come on
[53:26] amen if you don't believe it say Lord
[53:28] bring that to pass in my life amen he
[53:31] will call you aside if you'll obey him
[53:33] stay on the word believe it and he will
[53:35] place you into it into the church before
[53:37] the coming of Jesus Christ he will place
[53:39] into the church all the powers that
[53:41] Christ had in him will be in the
[53:44] church somebody receive all the powers
[53:47] that Christ had will be in the
[53:50] church
[53:52] Hallelujah all that God was he pour into
[53:55] Jesus all that Jesus Jesus was he PS
[53:57] into the church God wanting his work
[53:59] done he sent it into the Son and the son
[54:02] wanting the work done sent into the
[54:04] church so he quotes his scripture there
[54:07] and I'm going to take it from 38 now he
[54:10] says placing of a son pay attention to
[54:12] this now I'm giving you the second quote
[54:15] where he's going to place you before
[54:16] Angels take him out into a certain place
[54:20] have a ceremony before angels and place
[54:22] him positionally what he is in the body
[54:26] of Christ Christ
[54:28] amen amen then that person has the
[54:31] authority oh yes some of you are being
[54:33] placed right now amen in the presence of
[54:36] angels right now you are being placed in
[54:37] your position because there's nothing
[54:39] can place you better than the word than
[54:42] what I'm preaching to you right now
[54:44] teaching places you doesn't that Prophet
[54:46] teaches
[54:48] that thank you Lord

[55:30] position what are they doing the same
[55:33] Angels when the word was coming to
[55:38] Daniel demon powers were stopping the
[55:40] word from coming to Daniel yes so they
[55:43] formed a
[55:47] resistance so now when Satan is trying

[56:16] Prophet is saying he says the only thing
[56:18] I can do is cast to it doubt from your
[56:20] heart I don't know that I can do that
[56:23] I'll try by prayer and if the doubt

[57:27] rejoice and go home shouting praising
[57:29] God and get well don't let that shadow
[57:32] stand between you

[58:47] we haven't just come for religious
[58:48] gathering we have come for connection to
[58:50] connect in a strategic alliance with the
[58:53] Angelic world thank you Lord praise the
[58:55] Lord
[58:57] amen amen hallelujah the message doesn't
[59:00] come to make us de theologians but it's
[59:02] come to put the life in the church yes
[59:04] Lord thank you Jesus praise the Lord
[59:07] yeah now what Angelic beings do as well
[59:10] God always sends Angelic beings to one
[59:12] the world I believe there's Angelic
[59:14] beings in the Earth today are wanting
[59:16] the world of judgment to come before the
[59:18] destruction of Sodom and gomorra which
[59:20] is a perfect thing of today oh if you
[59:23] watch the Democratic party it's like the
[59:25] part of demon
[59:28] powers they are fixing to rise on the
[59:30] scene in fact they in power now under
[59:32] Revelation 13 but they can't make a move
[59:35] because the angel got his hand his foot
[59:37] on this head on the feet on the land and
[59:41] on the sea but they are in
[59:43] place notice Revelation 10 he descends
[59:46] with one foot on land one foot on sea
[59:49] Revelation 13 the Beast is rising out of
[59:51] land and the Beast is rising out of the
[59:53] sea so the angel comes to suppress these
[59:55] two two Powers because he's got his
[59:57] people on the Earth amen that must go
[1:00:00] and take the book from the Angel's hand
[1:00:02] right that's for the Gentiles for the
[1:00:04] Jews he's got the Four Angels in
[1:00:06] Revelation 7 holding back the winds amen
[1:00:10] yes so that's why they want to take out
[1:00:13] Israel but they can't take out
[1:00:15] Israel Putin wants to start World War
[1:00:18] III but something is holding him back he
[1:00:20] wants to press a
[1:00:23] button amen you know Russia the the uh
[1:00:27] symbol is the bear and now you got
[1:00:30] Ukraine like a small little mouse going
[1:00:32] stoking the bear poking him what's going
[1:00:35] to happen one day you keep poking the
[1:00:39] bear the bear is going to awaken but
[1:00:42] that can only happen when the bride
[1:00:44] leaves the Earth so right now they you
[1:00:47] know they all want to kill one another
[1:00:49] but they can't do it because four angels
[1:00:50] are holding back the winds winds mean
[1:00:52] Wars and strife the prophet says and
[1:00:55] then there's the mighty Angel standing
[1:00:56] with foot on land and sea suppressing
[1:00:58] the Beast and suppressing the Pope the
[1:01:00] pope is thinking I've got all world
[1:01:02] religions to sign the final document
[1:01:04] they're all in alignment but I can't
[1:01:05] make a move what's
[1:01:07] happening I want the pope to look up
[1:01:09] he'll see a foot on his
[1:01:12] head amen the Angel's foot is on his
[1:01:17] head thankes praise the Lord he says
[1:01:21] here now so Angel's ey warning that's
[1:01:24] what the point is God sent Angels down
[1:01:26] there to call lot out look just before
[1:01:29] the coming of the righteous one the
[1:01:30] great Son of God God sent an angel down
[1:01:33] and that angel came to a home that was a
[1:01:35] respected home he says if you want
[1:01:38] angels to visit your
[1:01:41] home be like zachariah's home him and
[1:01:44] sarrow is Li living upright before the
[1:01:46] Lord keeping all the statutes all the
[1:01:48] Commandments of the Lord living in
[1:01:50] perfect obedience to the Lord in the
[1:01:52] light that they had and the Commandment
[1:01:56] and zacharias's office was to wave
[1:01:58] incense so he's saying you be a priest
[1:02:00] that's what he's trying to tell you wave
[1:02:01] incense burning incense at the altar
[1:02:04] while the people were praying and while
[1:02:06] he was waving the incense standing on
[1:02:08] the right hand side of the altar stood
[1:02:09] Gabriel the great
[1:02:12] Archangel now in unchangeable word he
[1:02:14] says you can't walk with the world and
[1:02:16] expect God to walk with you Hallelujah
[1:02:19] remember that
[1:02:21] amen you hold to God's standard you hold
[1:02:23] to his word am the the Bible says
[1:02:26] there's a Time For Everything Under the
[1:02:27] Sun you don't need to jump ahead and do
[1:02:29] things you wait for God's time and
[1:02:31] season amen Angels won't visit you on
[1:02:34] nothing else but the world because you
[1:02:37] cannot mix God and the world together
[1:02:39] they will not mix God's holy separated
[1:02:41] from the world see what kind of a home
[1:02:44] the a angel comes to a home that keeps
[1:02:46] the Commandment of God a home that
[1:02:49] people that walks upright before God if
[1:02:51] you want the honor of an Angel visiting
[1:02:53] your home have a home ready for him to
[1:02:56] visit hallelujah amen prepared and ready

[1:03:02] of the Lord come to such places amen

[1:03:28] sister Venice amen she's a quiet sister
[1:03:31] who want to go and do things like that
[1:03:33] generally it's in her nature maybe
[1:03:36] but after the prayer she called brother
[1:03:38] Joshua and she said you've been
[1:03:40] complaining I don't know your exact
[1:03:41] words I'm paraphrasing says let me pray
[1:03:44] for you we've been complaining with that
[1:03:46] problem she said a simple prayer brother
[1:03:49] Joshua recognized something was
[1:03:51] different he received it right there and

[1:13:59] so
[1:14:04] watch very important quote now because
[1:14:07] this church I believe have have entered
[1:14:08] into this realm right amen I think any
[1:14:12] man or woman boy or
[1:14:15] girl and I think in an intellectual
[1:14:17] conception of what they think the word
[1:14:19] is and so forth can never can have a
[1:14:22] full Foundation stand until they have
[1:14:25] met that light that brings that word
[1:14:27] into reality how many if you can say
[1:14:29] you've met that light that brings the
[1:14:30] word into reality and the next part is
[1:14:33] very important I think no church in its
[1:14:35] practice no matter how intellectual and
[1:14:38] fundamental it may might be that church
[1:14:41] cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is
[1:14:44] made known among the people and they see
[1:14:47] it I'm asking you have you seen it can
[1:14:50] you give testimony to
[1:14:52] it yes Lord thank J something they can
[1:14:56] talk to that will talk back to them that
[1:14:59] vindicates this written word now watch
