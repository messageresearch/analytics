that we'd like to discuss amen and the pastors are working together to get the content and you know see how the spirit is leading us to address these topics Amen to encounter the enemy schemes because you find many things are being taught from school your parents may not even tell you I mean your children may not even tell you what they are being taught in school amen but when the enemy comes in like the flood the Lord has got to raise up the standard amen yeah amen and I must say a lot of you are looking very smart in your soups and your ties and God bless you amen thank you for listening

beautiful but look at the men come on look at them smile amen well done amen it shows you know if people can listen that's very good sign that they have humility amen so last week you requested all the brothers tools Wear Ties wear their coats because I see you in other places and you're wearing it I don't know why you don't wait for church amen we're coming here to serve the King of Kings and the Lord of lords we are to dress our best amen hallelujah amen so this morning we'll speak on Queen of Queens this is our sixth part and I'd like to entitle it let it be written amen who's the queen of Queens amen somebody say me Amen Let It Be written and the inspiration is from if you say Mark 11 23 amen hallelujah let's take our scripture reading let's take it from Esther chapter 3 for the Caleb you'll go into your uh Bible update and project the scriptures I don't have it all typed up amen Esther chapter 3 and verse 7. Hallelujah amen if it please the king now this is amen talking Let It Be written that they may be destroyed talking about the Jews and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of business to bring it into the king's Treasures and the King took his ring from his hand now learned from these things the king's sealed a ringing that time had a seal and that's how they signed their letters amen they put it in ink and the letter was signed once that was done nothing could change it not even the king himself could change it amen so he took the ring from his finger and gave it to aim and the son of Emma data the agatite the Jews enemy and the King said to Amon the silver is given to thee the people also to do with them as it seemed good to thee so power and authority of the kingdom is being given to amen amen then then were the king scribes called on the 13th day of the first month what's the first month listen and they were written according to all that amen had commanded unto the king's lieutenants and to the governors that were over every Province and the rulers of every people and every Province according to the writing day off and every people after the language in the name of King aesurus was it written sealed with the king's ring amen and the letters were sent by post into the king's provinces to destroy to kill and to cause to pray perish all Jews both young and old little children and women in one day even upon the 13th day of the 12th month amen which is the month of Da and to take the spoil of them for a prayer the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given to in every Province was published unto all people that they should be ready against that day the post went out being Asian by the king's commandment and the key was given in shusha and the palace and the king and amen amen sat down to drink but the city's shushan was perplexed then we'll go to Esther for eight so that was the beginning of the decree being sent amen we'll go to Esther chapter 8 verse 5. year now after Esther and Mordecai uncover even scheme and amen is dealt with we come to the queen of Queens Esther and she comes before the king remember she asked him the king asked her what is that desire what is that request even to ask the Kingdom so she says if you please the king and if I found favor in his sight and the thing seemed right before The King and I be pleasing in his eyes Let It Be written to reverse the letters devised by aim and the son of him a doctor the agatype which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces but you know what the king says now because this is law for How Can I Endure to see evil that shall come upon my people or How Can I Endure to see destruction of my Kindred then the king asari said unto Esther the queen and to Mordechai the Jew behold I have given Esther the house of Amen in the King's house and let him and him have they hanged upon the Gallows because he had his hand upon the Jews right he also for the Jews as it like with you amen amen I can't change my law you rewrite it amen hope you're getting it right to you also for the Jews as it liked you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and filled with the king's Ring May no man reverse amen may the Lord a blessing to the meaning of his word you may be seated so I can see you got the inspiration already if you say amen Hallelujah so we know the story of Queen Esther get into the kingdom amen for such a time as this when there would be a persecution come upon the Jews and you have been called in the same time the Lord could have put Paul in this day he could have pulled all other seven churches messages he could have even preserved for the Branham to be alive in this time at the coming of the Lord but he chose you yes amen because you are the standard that is being raised up in this hour yes amen amen I believe we have the Pinnacle of our faith right now amen amen hallelujah something is about to happen amen it's about to explode amen explosion of Faith amen amen hallelujah we find amen even yesterday if you I just want to bring this one point she was taken before the King on the 10th month on the 17th why why that particular number what she presented before the king amen because Revelation 10 7 amen Elise is commissioned to find a bride for the king for the king of kings amen this was just an ordinary King even though he ruled 127 provinces amen but he is not King of Kings we are under King of Kings and if we are married to the King of Kings we become Queen amen so we are queen of Queens amen hallelujah take your rightful place amen recognize your position your Authority amen I just need to lay this down a bit amen hallelujah so you just bear with me I want you to notice that when the letters are going forward maybe you can pick it up there in Esther 3 12. watch what is happening they are sending it to every provincial rulers of people every Province they're sending the writing in their own language amen hallelujah it is being prophesied it is being put in a print form it is being said if I could say it in this way by the fourth dimension amen kill the Jew on the 13th day but amen 13 day of a dog so remember the writing went out in what month the first month Satan wants you to live on the field for 12 months and on the 12th month he wants to destroy and kill even the children can you imagine how the Jews must have been living in fear amen yes yes writing letters about your sickness I'm gonna crisscross here with the Enemy now writing letters about your death Satan is not happy that you are alive in this time and that your faith is with an happiness hour amen hallelujah now notice what king Asura said when a king decrease something when it sealed with his ring nothing not even I can change it amen Hallelujah if we find you in Genesis 41 verse 39 just to show you this amen and show you some background when Joseph was written up notice now every time the king gives his ring the person is rising from a great trial a great test Joseph is thrown from it the highest position in his father's mind he had him as his favorite son is thrown into the lowest position of the pit then from the pity Soldier as a slave he rises to the highest position in part of his house amen then from the highest position in part of his house he goes to the prison house amen what is it great trials the Lord wants to see can you endure can you make it through these trials because there's a greater blessing no matter how much you may have tried amen keep getting back up amen fourth accusations came against Joseph amen but he's still endured amen the brothers hated him and they threw him in the pit not everyone in this life will like you yeah amen hallelujah part of her believe his wife's false accusation amen and he got thrown into prison because of that not from the prison house the King has a need to interpret a dream and then the Lord set him back all the way back then that he was seeing dreams amen pay attention to how God has been dealing with you in your life amen amen God's going to use you in that region amen God's going to use you for that purpose amen immediately dormant for a long time nobody may have recognized your gift but they are going to call for you one day amen thank you amen hallelujah he's there William brand of sitting amongst us amen hallelujah you remember when he went to that Pentecostal meeting who did they call for amen they called for William Branham amen he said I tried to sink into my seat yeah amen hallelujah he said there's a yes sitting here it's time to stand up and be counted amen yes amen amen amen hallelujah you've been reserved and preserved for such a time as this amen so Joseph amen he's now raised up and he interprets Pharaoh's dream and now watch what Pharaoh does and Pharaoh said to Joseph for as much as God had showed these all this there is none so discreet and wise as Thou Art and I'm gonna tell her about you he's not so discreet and wise as you the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ thou shall be over my house has he gone away the Lord who did he place over his house come on now amen thou shall be over my house and according unto Thy Word shall all my people be ruled amen amen only in the throne will I be greater than thou amen who's greater than the bride the Lord Jesus Christ but on Earth she has Dominion Authority amen yeah amen amen and Pharaoh said to Joseph see I have set thee over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and the radium investors of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck so you see if you like gold chains you're an Egyptian and he made him to ride in the second Chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee hmm and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt amen amen and Pharaohs head out to Joseph I am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand of foot in all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh called Joseph's name paneer and gave into wife essene the daughter of potterfield priest of on and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt notice now even if Pharaoh had Sons and the way next in line to the throne when the trumpet is blown they have to bow before Joseph amen yes amen Satan and all his demon powers are trembling because they have to bow amen amen not only do you possess the name in your lips you have the married name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen oh I don't know if you're getting that amen you pay his name not only in word only yes amen you change your surname you're not one of these women who keep their first discern it they made the names but you are the woman who have taken on his name amen yes amen hallelujah blessed be his name that's a submission to Authority amen glory be to his name amen then we find here in Daniel 6 and verse 8. amen you remember when the Daniel was set in his ruler ruler above all the provinces they in Babylon and they hated Daniel so now I'm not going to read the whole story you can pick it up in six I want to go from verse 8. you're telling O King establish a decree sign the writing then it be not changed according to the law of the myths and Persians which also it not wherefore King David signed the writing and the decree now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being opened in his chamber towards Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a full time nothing will stop us from our prayer life amen nothing should hind us from our prayer life amen no matter how much loss they pass we shall not be stopped amen [Music] amen hallelujah amen the judges may give it to you in writing the doctors may give it to you in writing there take this and go you have a problem you have cancer you have autism amen you have high blood pressure you have sugar they may be writing your death sentence what are you gonna do about it refuse to accept it amen write your own letters amen yes amen write a letter back to him yes hallelujah thank you Lord I have been delivered from whatever it is yes for By His whoms I am healed yes Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen refuse to accept anything the devil devil hey even to walk in Dominion Authority and call those things that are not as though they are amen yes amen you say brother isn't that being delusional no there's a difference between a fact and the difference between truth the doctor may not be wrong it may be a fact that somebody has cancer and heart disease but the truth is by his stripes I'm healed amen the truth amen will prevail amen and the fact must bother to the truth yes because facts can always change how many female facts are changeable yeah amen if I tell you the bottle is here that's a fact now I moved it here is that still a fact okay this is still there so you see how the fact changed so the sickness may have come upon you Satan assign something and try to put it upon you amen but place the truth over the fact amen amen hallelujah amen we find here amen then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God then they came near and spit before the king concerning the king's decree and it's not thou signed a decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within 30 days save of the O King shall be cast into a dead of lions the king answered and said the thing is true according to the law of the meat and Persians which ultimate not once a king makes a decree even he can't alter it the king didn't want to throw Daniel in the Lion's Den but even he could note it and Daniel had to be thrown into the lion's den amen hallelujah oh bless his name amen hallelujah amen didn't they also try to throw the three boys in the fiery furnace amen why didn't they make a decree that if you don't bow yeah you must be thrown into a fiery furnace these are laws and decrees that were written Amen brother Caleb go to slide five then amen see why God did this amen bless His holy name so he made the furnace when they had eaten it seven times hotter to be sure that the program of God would be destroyed but God wanted to display his power and all Babylon and all hell could not defeat the purpose no sir no matter anything he could have eaten that furnace a million times hotter it would have never destroyed the purpose of God Amen yes amen amen no matter what Satan tries to do against you it will not defeat God's purpose for your life amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen amen let's go to First Kings chapter 21. now we read about this to the queen let's find another corrupt Queen and see what she did through deception she stole the king's ring and she wrote in his name First Kings chapter 21 and verse 1. just to give you the background you know this is dealing with neighbors Vineyard that's an inheritance and according to the law in Jerusalem the law in Israel nobody can take your inheritance are you listening to me amen nobody can take your inheritance amen yes amen they may rent it for a while but at the time of Jubilee it's gonna come back to you yes amen sending me I've tried to stop you from your blessing try to stop your email from and entering your growth Amen to progress as a young man in life and to come up in life amen but today make a declaration make a decree amen rewrite the letters and say from this day forward I stop you in Jesus name amen and he came to pass after these things the neighbor the jezreal island of Vineyard amen hallelujah and verse 2 A.M speak to neighbor saying give me thy Vineyard oh I want your inheritance that I may have it for a garden of herbs he wants to take your stimulation of Revelation a threat I'm putting up God in it what is wine what is wine what do you make from it why yes wine type stimulation of Revelation amen he wants to dispossess this man of his revelation and put a herb God in there amen he says I'll give you a bit of veneer than it if it seemed good today doesn't give them better churches yeah yeah why are you worried about the revelation of William Branham and the word end time word end time message in time message they're like that word enzyme using enzyme end time it sounds so doomy and gloomy the end of time but not to us it's the end for them we are proclaiming that it's the end for them for us it's not the end for us it's the beginning of all things amen and his neighbor said to him the Lord forbidded me that I should give the inheritance to my fathers and today and they have came into his house heavy and this please because the word which neighbor the jezreeland had spoken to him right so here in verse 5 Jezebel his wife comes to him and said why is that spirit so sad now it is no bread and then he tells you what happened and then in verse 7 does not govern the Kingdom of Israel arise eat bread let there not be merry I will give Thee the Dominion sure of neighbor the jezraelites amen so she wrote letters you know what the Bible says now she wrote letters in Arab's name without permission and feel it with his seal and send letters unto the elders and the Nobles that were in the city dwelling with neighbors this is the lowest of Queens and she wrote in the letter saying proclaimer fast and said neighbor to high among the people and said two men sons of Bilal before him to Bear witness against him and say thou just blaspheme God and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die and the men of the city even the elders and Nobles which were inhabitants in the city did as Jezebel at the same time to them and as it was written in lit in the letters which he had sent unto them amen so they go and they fulfill these things they bring a false accusation against neighbor why because of a false writing that went out and they stole the king's zeal amen [Music] what do you think the property is preaching about when he's preaching Blasphemous names they stole the king's seal they established their own denominations yes build churches and they stamped it with a seal but yet he is never commissioned them to do it he commissioned the prophet he sent the angel to the prophet yes and after the prophet if you read Revelation 10 The Voice doesn't go to them the voice comes to us and I heard another amen The Voice from heaven sent to me go and take the book amen from the prophet is coming to the pride yes amen hallelujah amen we are commissioned for this hour we're gonna know who we are in this hour we're gonna take back everything amen yes yes Hallelujah yes don't let this denominational Giants tell you how powerful they are and what services they are having amen they are using the sinking Shield without his permission yes amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah it's time to shake up Babylon Daniel Shook Up Babylon amen the three Euro boys Shook Up Babylon amen it's time to shake it up again yes amen hallelujah even the angels who respond to you Gabriel will come to you Michael will come and respond amen you are not fighting this battle alone amen amen angels are commissioned and dispatched Amen to fight the battle in the Supernatural yeah thank you but you proclaim the flesh all of Heaven response amen don't think nothing is happening you will carry the words of life you carry the power and authority back by God Almighty in this hour amen amen hallelujah you know the time Nehemiah went to rebuild the world I don't have time to go into right now amen but Nehemiah said King they may not believe us that you have actually sent us to rebuild the world he said give us letters in writing so then we can present it to them there in Jerusalem that we are not building up our own accord amen we are commissioned to build the walls amen amen amen amen so it's written in writing amen so you'll find Nehemiah together with Israel amen and all of these people amen go back to rebuild the walls but they needed letters from the King amen hallelujah words are good words are good but what is a seed and the seed must be sown Into the Heart amen amen hallelujah and once it's sown Into the Heart amen think about it the Lord God spoke in the beginning Let There Be amen and there was amen what is the spoken word it's the Original Seed we have come back to Original Seed again if you say yes if you say Let There Be amen amen let there be a squirrel come there let it run around this branch and come and sit there Amen Let there be another one come this way amen Hallelujah a super anointing come upon the bride amen a super anointed for this time amen why because the super word was released amen Revelation 10 amen amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he has sounded the mystery of God is finished amen now people have risen up now yeah you [Music] amen say amen amen raise your hand and thank the Lord right now shake some Spirits off of you amen amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen write the word amen amen oh Hallelujah I feel the anointing now amen hallelujah [Music] [Music] Mary and he's coming back to the line of the tribe of Judah amen but is that word gone away or does it still stand as a declaration even today amen the Bible says neither tonight the attitude speech amen here today they give glory to the Lord amen so that first Bible is still in existence yes amen amen didn't he write his second Bible there in the pyramid amen hallelujah what's laying next to the pyramid there's a figure there where the lion body and a virgin face a face of a woman with a lion body they call it the springs they don't know what it is I am telling you what it is it's a sign God wrote his Bible there stops with the Virgin and it ends with a lion amen hallelujah the prophet told us God wrote his Bible in the pyramids even the flat couldn't destroy that word amen because it's God's word even today amen it stands for The Monuments amen so if God brought it in the heavens and it still stands God wrote it in the pyramid the pyramid still stands how many years have gone by 6 000 years look at any other building amen that has been able to stand that fossils of nature stand Wars amen which stand was amen but it's God's word and evidence Earth will pass away but his word will never pass away hallelujah how about the written word yes amen amen hallelujah we have the written word in the form of the Bible amen 66 books amen written by different authors but none of them contradict one another brutally in different times different seasons but it never gets old it never gets stale the power leads in the world when the power of the amen the scriptures applied in the lips of faith will produce the results amen amen take the word and apply the word by faith yes sir thank you amen amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord that never could tell us right division yeah Hallelujah don't you speak it yes write it because you're a queen yes amen amen thank you Lord Make It law amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah and you've got to teach your children and your children's children amen ask yourself now and if you went to law school to study the laws of the land but yet there are laws in the country who taught you the laws do they send the children to school to learn the laws of the Lamb I don't know of anyone that went to school to learn the laws of the land but they learn from people their parents we're not allowed to do this the speed limit is this this is that this this this this amen who teaches them besides lawyers I don't know anyone else who knows all the laws of the land you know all the laws of the land even the ones you disagree with they take it from you Lord pay amen hallelujah amen but application of the word is important saying it correctly is important right reciting something correctly is important to get the results now when we're saying the revelation of the world is important you can quote the word and it has no effect amen you can quote the word without Revelation where you can quote the word without faith because faith is a revelation right and a person can quote the word for many years for 40 years they can quote the word and be in the wilderness condition why they are not seeing the evidence of the word living in them hey amen right for example Millions can I see millions of churches quoting Matthew 28 19. yeah preach the gospel teach them to baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit now they have converts they even have churches amen but that is not the Revelation yes is that the revelation but we know that the holy spirit will bring things our remembrance and teach us all things so when the Holy Ghost pours out on the day of Pentecost he reveals to Peter the Revelation that the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ and it's the correct formula to be baptized in amen amen I hope you're learning brother Renault amen Acts 2 38 Pete on the day of Pentecost filled with the Holy Ghost says repent and be baptized in the name yes amen of Jesus Christ amen for the remission of your sins so it's important to have the revelation of what Jesus said yes amen isn't it the same with the godhead amen you have a trinitarian thought of the godhead maybe a tune is thought a Oneness thought extra Etc but the holy spirit in this time has come to give us a correct interpretation of the godhead which is it the condescension of the one true God yes now he came from Spirit to word to flesh amen and the Holy Spirit again is now forming himself in a many-membered body amen that's what Christ the mystery is all about now remember he came from Spirit then he became theophany word Manchester then he became flesh Jesus he ascended on high where is he now son of God Son of God Ministry what is Son of God Ministry Holy Spirit in a people God in the people no longer God above us no longer god with us but now God in us amen now to many of you that may sound like you know that but that's a mystery to people that's one of the mystery truths that's been revealed to us amen amen and right now we are poking Satan in his remember we read those quotes last week we are punishing him every time he hears the Revelation the true Revelation he's getting punched he's getting beaten yeah amen hallelujah amen amen amen amen hallelujah turn to your neighbor telling Jesus Is God I wish you could see saved now you got a blue eye with that okay amen so the same applies with prayer a lot of people are praying same principle applies but there's a reason why the law details The Lord's Prayer in that way amen it's a guideline for us when we pray and approach the Lord to pray amen and you know many times Jesus said when you pray so there's a reason why the Lord has asked you to do that he says because there's a promise attached to it right and then you shall receive what you have asked for so praying is what making your supplications known to the Lord amen it's making your request communicating right so we're coming now to a time where laws have been Rewritten in the land laws are changing [Music] we're in another sort of condition yes that has now become legalized it's the even though it's a minority population and a minority group they have exalted it it's become the number one priority for leading Nations to Advocate and they call it humans rights but it's another solemn sign amen amen amen Luke 17. even as it was in the days of lot so shall it be yes the coming of the son of man so when you see all of them frauding their rights their lesbian the gay rights they transgender rights it's a sign of the end yes amen hallelujah amen amen and I'm gonna say it plainly amen so that everybody understands it's not the natural order for boys to like boys girls to like girls lives God created man and a woman God's institution is a man will marry a wife a man can't marry a man and a woman can't marry a woman yes amen the schools may tell you it's okay but God's word is against it amen they are going against God's law God's nature and men are becoming so perverted they put up women all this time since the 60s to give their moments rights women's Liberation they put them up and set them up not the same man goes and says I identify as a woman so he gets all the women's rights foreign they believe them now they're competing in their races they are setting new records this thing has gone crazy in the U.S they are setting new records breaking records now they are so perverted because they're only acting like they transgender so this one guy says I'm transgender I'm a man biologically is a man but now he's identifying as a woman so now he's saying in my position because he wants to lie with a woman he's saying I'm a lesbian woman but you see how corrupted there he still wants to be a woman or sorry to be with a woman but in order to attain all the rights and all the Privileges he's identifying as a transgender saying is a woman but then now you say no I want to be with another woman I'm a lesbian woman okay corruption corruption people are going crazy doesn't the prophet prophesy they'll come a time neurotics on the air yes gone insane totally insane why you think he wants you to get out of the mall the other day yeah he said I saw hell back on the Earth amen so Revelation 6 8 it goes right into our point now amen so laws are being Rewritten right now against the people of God politics has United demon powers have United religion has United and all hell is against the body of Jesus Christ yes all hell is left loose upon them right now 200 million demons were let loose from the review of rages you know their brothers now with regards to the one world religion there's no more document for them to sign amen right if you go and search it out attack the final document yeah for religion it was signed last year in September there's no more meetings the Popes are going to have with anyone they have signed the final document for all religions to be United now they are gone to prophesy again and implement it yes right right that's what's happening right now so Revelation 6 and 8 I saw a Payless and his name that sat on him was what death and what followed him have followed him and all power was given unto them over the fourth part of the Earth isn't that a ring given to them isn't that power given to them to kill with sword hunger death and would end with the Peace of the other amen but no matter what Rises Esther amen amen you can't go now to the Lord and say Lord rewrite your word rewrites his word but what can you do amen you need to rewrite what happens when they are coming against you now yes are you gonna fall like the first Eve that's their plan if you go look at their battle plan divide and conquer the message Church defeat them deceive them infiltrate them amen that's their loss they're given power to do it but Esther amen rewrite the laws yes amen amen you know what the prophet says there's nothing can keep me from rising amen say that aloud now there's nothing there's nothing can keep me from rising amen I'm going to read now there ain't enough devils in all hell can keep me from rising they ain't in enough nothing nowhere to keep me from rising I have the promise of God I have the Holy Spirit I got Zoe God's eternal life resting in here say thank you Lord for the holy spirit amen amen the most powerful force on the Earth right now living in you amen hallelujah amen listen to what he says in that sixth line amen when God speaks all hell moves that's everything can't stand in his presence amen hallelujah amen yeah he says When God says anything commissions it sends it to the Earth all hell might explode right now they are exploding lava volcanic eruptions amen hallelujah but it will never change God's word it'll be anyhow God then spoke it that makes it right shoe that settles it with me when God says so I believe it don't you amen oh bless the name of Jesus amen Hallelujah let's go to the next one he says watch for Satan to raise up he's true when all 11 turns loose all hell turns loose too so don't think that Revelation 6 8 all evidence turned loose hear what he says now all Heaven has turned loose if all hell is on the Earth Heaven is on the earth combating them yes and it's prophesied that to be a Janice and generous on the earth in the last days wouldn't almost impersonate the real thing so close it'll deceive the very elective possible amen oh somebody ought to praise the Lord right there say thank you Lord that I cannot be deceived yes Lord amen not will not I cannot be deceived amen amen amen he says in Christ the mystery coming to an individual Revelation now God didn't say to Peter upon all of you are doing my church it's upon the one that has the Revelation Upon This Rock Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church so he says it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching and all that is against this truth but it is the truth amen you are packing the message of the hour you are packing the truth of the day amen and all hell is against your Revelation yes that's right that's right amen amen amen thank you Lord and that's the mystery people may think hey you ain't significant somebody but yeah he says his Mysteries only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one could see it amen that's right you can speak from now until Kingdom Come talking to some people yeah and they will never see it that's correct there is no seed there um right Hallelujah he says Flesh and Blood never reveal it to you but upon this Revelation call that group I'll build my church in them and all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it there's nothing you're going through in this life that Satan can withstand you Satan cannot withstand when you speak yes yes the reason why you are living with a condition you are living with that problem Jesus even said sometimes you pray but you pray a miss you're praying presumptuously you are praying in Hope but when you pray by faith amen when you speak by faith there is nothing can stand before you amen thank you Lord amen Hallelujah Blessed Be His holy name amen amen let's progress to thought now amen so here we are with Esther you know what happened amen divides the plan to kill all the Jews in one day right then bordecai finds out about it because the letters are being sent Mordecai gets one of the letters but Esther is unaware remember trials and tribulations what we said now will raise you to your position the testing will raise you to your ought to be conditioned it's meant to push you it's meant to perf you that's what happened to Joseph all of his trials worth of him to their position all of Daniel's trials brought him to that position yes now the same thing is going to happen to Esther amen she is now sitting here as Queen she's the married wife but she's living in the Kingdom without any Authority she doesn't know that she can speak she doesn't know Authority as Queen oh thank you Lord so for many years she served there not knowing a position until there was one Branham that spoke to us amen and said who knows you have been put into the kingdom for such a time as this amen let's go to uh now remember we preached this the last time number four is the number of Deliverance so Deliverance is coming in the fourth chapter of Esther amen amen read the last verse there maybe one before this just before this way he says Deliverance will come from another place I think it's a verse before this where you're speaking to him amen yeah if they're all together old is thy peace at this time this shell and and their child and enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and their father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou Art coming to a King into the kingdom for such a time as this but look at Mordecai's Revelation yes Mordecai knows that these people are at the Abraham's Covenant yeah that nobody can destroy them he's saying if you don't raise up to your position deliberate is going to arise from another place yes if you are not the people that's going to rise up to your position God's Gonna raise up a people yeah don't think God because it's written in his word once he writes it he can't change it it's written that Abraham's people have blessed people that they can never be destroyed God may put you to trials through situation because of unbelief because of circumstances amen God May throw you to the Babylonians God may put you to trials amen but God's purpose will not be defeated amen amen amen so Deliverance will arise from another place if the messages shall not raise up to the standard and recognize the position but we thank God preaching like this preaching like that made us go away yes yes you are right Mordecai yes you are right brother Branham we are the people amen for too long I've been reading it there as a future prophecy but we are the super church we are aim and the Invincible Army for too long she's been an invisible Army amen amen for too long the message people have been an invisible Army but right now we are raising up to be an invincible army yes amen thank you Lord amen Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so we find amen now watch I need to detail this but I'm not going to read it because it'll take too long to read but maybe I can frame it in a few minutes Eamonn scheme is exposed right you know she calls him to the banquet of wines you know what the banquet of wine is it's a simulation of Revelation now he's highly revelated so she invites him to the banquet of wine amen all seven seals are open to her the banquet of wines she is living under the stimulation of Revelation what did the seals reveal did leave your Satan unveiled Satan schemes he's brought to kill to destroy how you went from deception to the Palos yes so that's what he did now it unveiled Satan's schemes then she the king is unaware of this because remember Eamon was a prince and he wrote These decrees and laws because the king gave him the Signet and the ring and this guy when wrote his laws we find amen is now killed he's hanging on the Gallows pay attention I'm closing this is the allergy is hung on the Gallows and he prepared for monicaiah so animal is dead but what about the decree it's now months later but a die is still coming the day of death and destruction because what did we say nothing can stop the Great Tribulation that's what I'm getting to right it's already been written no matter how much they fast and pray you can't do nothing about it it's already written so even though amen is there is and now in fellowship with the King but the day is fast approach him the day is fast approaching when death and destruction is coming amen Esther getting the king to kill amen didn't change the law didn't change the circumstance that was not the Deliverance how many of you really followed what the True Deliverance was have we progressed so far into the story to see where Deliverance came from who delivered the Jews I think most time it's preached it stops it you follow me how would the laws change it couldn't be changed amen it couldn't be changed even though Eamon was dead there was still an army raising up to slaughter on their day even though she pleads with the King the king suggests why did you write take my ring I can't change my own word amen amen hallelujah God cannot read write end-time prophecies what he wrote must come to pass his word will not change amen hallelujah amen Satan and his army are now preparing to come against the people of God and will make a final move against the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ so what must we do amen hallelujah we need to form an offensive yeah yes amen because the day is coming you and daily battles you think you're backsliding because of your own backsliding Satan is causing you to backslide amen you think you're missing church because of that Satan is deceiving you the Bible the word says was taken up the assembly together of ourselves can I get an amen who's deceiving you to disobey that word did the prophet say you can miss work but don't miss church come on now do we believe a prophet yes Hallelujah does the property to sin to work on a Sunday yeah yeah oh let's go back to the message come on now come on don't get quiet on me amen amen if it's a sin to walk in the sun is it a sin to work on a Wednesday and not come to church do you tell your boss I'm going to church sorry I got church today I can't come to work but why do you want to do it to the most time oh I go to work today I can't come to church why are we pride prioritizing an Earthly job over the things of God why amen why who's doing this Satan is deceiving yes faith is being Slipped Away before you know it you're overtake it amen you need to stand your ground amen this is not some social club this is the battle Amen in a battle here amen we are an army we are not just amen we should worship people amen hallelujah God is raising up an army at this time amen hallelujah amen hallelujah people don't like the truth but the truth shall set you free the truth will deliver you from hell yes amen the truthful amen hallelujah always stand go to church order 63 26 and 12. you see

message type search the sermon keep it spiritual amen I'm trying to close I'm trying to eat my highlights now amen hallelujah we got it he says and keep it spiritual for remember all the forces of the dark kingdoms of Satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow in the Lord sure and we've been growing yes amen right here is what he's telling you now all the forces the dark kingdom of Satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow in the Lord and you must be soldiers amen amen did he say you must be Pious put on your Royal robe why did you go for soldiers you must be soldiers not fresh recruits you don't have fresh recruits fresh the truths that make you train out freshly truth and to keep telling you come to church come to church baby baby oh come here baby put you here intubated come come please we're not looking for fresh recruits amen now ask yourself you've been there how long in the message shouldn't you be a warrior amen what is your rank and file what is the most in the most bottom layer okay the ordinary Soldier don't be cooking beans in the kitchen come out onto the battlefield amen amen you must be soldiers not fresh recruits your aged soldiers now amen and being trained to fight amen and Satan will come among you and cause you to dispute one another if you can turn him down just immediately amen your brethren and it's the enemy yeah and we're here to hold a standard yes in this evening time life that's what I'm trying to hold right now a standard of the message of the hour praise the Lord we must come back come back standing there amen not wishy-washy Christians thank you Lord praise the Lord amen hold the standard in this evening time light when the world is darkened and the whole church kingdom is going to the church Council of into the Council of churches and pretty soon they'll try and attack a sign on the door saying close and then we're going to have to meet in other places you see you can't shut us down here's the prophecy yeah he says if they close the church doors we're gonna meet in other places we'll tell you where it'll be secret he says we'll meet in other places because they certainly close the church doors one of these days if we don't take the mouth of the Beast and we're depending on staying true to god Till Death sets us free and that's what we intend to do if you can say amen amen amen that's what we intend to do amen hallelujah amen thank you let me close now Hallelujah I got a powerful closing if I can only get to it amen how many of you believe me amen hallelujah amen okay I've got some scriptures I want to lay Amen to close let's go to Matthew 28 18. so the one who has all authority now gave Queen Esther and Mordecai The Authority he gave the ring right he gave the power and he told him why don't you write laws yourself right but remember the law can't change the initial law that must still come to pass right but yeah I want to show you the king of kings now and how he empowered his queen of queens and Jesus came and spank unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth he was all power in Heaven and Earth amen say Jesus Jesus now he tells us to go he therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father son the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world then we go to John 20 and 21 amen John 20 and 21 then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father had sent me so send I you amen did the father send him with all authority yeah that the father sent him with all power so as the father sent me so send are you amen Luke 10 19 now amen I'm just laying this now to finish Luke 10 19. behold I have given you power to train upon serpents scorpions over all the power of the enemy amen say thank you Lord for the power amen Over All over all Satan's schemes Satan's sicknesses Satan's diseases and thank you for the healing I thank you for the Deliverance in Jesus name giving praise right now amen over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by enemies hurt you yes nothing shall hurt you amen not good standing in this Rejoice not but that Spirits are subject unto you but Rejoice rather because your names are written in heaven and I'm going to progress in Revelation a bit further because your names are written in heaven what name do you have written in heaven what's your name in heaven your name in heaven is Mrs Jesus Christ amen take back your rightful name amen you're the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ Amen
