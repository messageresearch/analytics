[3:27] some other time praise the Lord amen
[3:30] amen because the moving of the holy
[3:32] spirit is different to our kindal
[3:33] thinking amen so we just got to watch
[3:36] how we amen cooperate with the Holy
[3:39] Spirit this morning amen because we
[3:41] don't want to be leading ourselves the
[3:42] Holy Ghost was sent to lead and guide
[3:44] the church so I'm going to take a topic
[3:46] that may seem unfamiliar to you uh or
[3:49] maybe just a title and I want to title
[3:51] it the Philadelphia Corridor amen and
[3:55] you'll see why because there are
[3:57] terrorists within our territory that's
[3:59] trying to inade our borders of the
[4:00] message of the hour and take Souls
[4:03] captive amen but there's a strategic
[4:06] point you know we've been speaking on uh
[4:08] maintaining borders and strengthening
[4:09] our borders amen the opening up of
[4:12] spiritual Frontiers so there are certain
[4:14] Frontiers we must maintain which is the
[4:16] Philadelphia Corridor amen hallelujah I
[4:19] know that sounds like a military
[4:20] language to us this morning amen but
[4:23] just amen I don't even know how I'm
[4:24] going to say it or what I'm going to
[4:25] come across as but you just leave it to
[4:27] the Holy Spirit and let him work amen
[4:29] remember the natural types of spiritual
[4:32] and then he says USA is the type of
[4:34] Israel as well amen praise the Lord so
[4:37] just keep these things in mind if we can
[4:39] just go to a few scriptures this morning

[4:43] then you can be
[4:44] seated praise the
[4:49] Lord hallelujah everybody love the Lord
[4:52] amen hallelujah we can go to um The Book
[4:56] of
[4:57] Matthew chapter 15
[5:01] oh sorry before we go there amen maybe
[5:03] we'll just read another portion of
[5:05] scripture just to get you seated and
[5:06] then we'll read those scriptures
[5:11] amen let's read 1 Peter 5: 6 and 11 uh
[5:15] 211 1 Peter chapter
[5:17] 5 you see this is what we need to start
[5:20] to
[5:21] do and verse 6 says humble
[5:25] yourselves amen humble yourselves there
[5:29] for under the mighty hand of God that he
[5:32] may exalt you in due time amen amen
[5:36] casting all your care upon him for he
[5:39] carth for you oh yes amen
[5:42] amen then he goes on to say be sober be
[5:45] vigilant because your adversary the
[5:48] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[5:51] seeking whom he may
[5:54] devour whom resist steadfast in the
[5:56] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[5:59] are com accomplished in your brethren
[6:01] that are in the world but the God of all
[6:04] Grace who had called us unto his eternal
[6:06] glory by Christ Jesus after that he have
[6:10] suffered a while make you perfect
[6:12] establish strengthen and settle you to
[6:15] him be glory and Dominion forever and
[6:17] ever amen praise the Lord then we want
[6:20] to read 1 Corinthians
[6:22] 10:3 sorry sorry one 2 Corinthians
[6:25] chapter 10 2 Corinthians chapter 10
[6:30] amen we can read from verse
[6:33] three for though we walk in the flesh we
[6:37] do not war after the
[6:40] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[6:42] not
[6:43] carnal But Mighty notice now the Holy
[6:47] Spirit picked up words now we spoke
[6:49] about a mighty God Amen we just read out
[6:51] God is mighty here and we said he's got
[6:53] a mighty Army but now he's also got
[6:55] another word called
[6:57] Mighty amen
[7:00] But Mighty through God so the weapons
[7:03] are even mighty to the pulling down of
[7:05] strongholds yes amen now remember Gaza
[7:08] is called strong is a strong City it's a
[7:11] stronghold right and Hamas is
[7:14] violence the word of m means violence
[7:17] and Gaza means stronghold praise the
[7:19] Lord I'm just showing you the natural
[7:21] there what's happening amen Mighty to
[7:24] through God to the pulling down of
[7:26] strongholds casting down imaginations
[7:29] and every every High thing that exalted
[7:31] itself against the knowledge of God and
[7:33] bringing into captivity every thought to
[7:36] The Obedience of
[7:39] Christ amen so what we spoke last week
[7:42] you got to take the word to the
[7:43] Battleground because in the in the mind
[7:45] is where Satan is coming that's the
[7:47] corridor he's trying to
[7:49] invade so we got to take the word to the
[7:51] Battleground and having in Readiness to
[7:54] Revenge all Disobedience when your
[7:56] obedience is fulfilled you may be seated
[7:58] the Lord at blessings to the read of his
[7:59] word very quickly we'll go to Ephesians
[8:01] chap 6
[8:04] verse2
[8:06] amen Ephesians 6 and: 12 for we wrestle
[8:10] not against flesh and blood but against
[8:13] principalities against Powers against
[8:15] rulers of the darkness of this world
[8:17] against spiritual wickedness in high
[8:20] places amen hallelujah so the battle is
[8:23] taking place in high places therefore
[8:25] God wants us and he's called us into
[8:27] Heavenly places to strategically
[8:30] position ourselves to defeat the enemy
[8:32] can you say Amen to that amen amen
[8:34] hallelujah now it's important in this
[8:36] hour to walk in
[8:38] obedience right you remember Saul didn't
[8:40] walk in obedience to the word and if we
[8:43] go brother brother Josh you very quickly
[8:45] to 1 Samuel 15 verse
[8:48] 22-23 it
[8:50] says and Samuel said at the
[8:54] Lord as great Delight in birth offerings
[8:57] and sacrifices as in obeying the voice
[9:00] of the Lord behold to obey is better
[9:03] than sacrifice and to arken than the fat
[9:06] of Rams for Rebellion is as a sin of
[9:09] Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[9:11] iniquity and idolatry because thou
[9:13] rejected the word of the Lord he has
[9:15] also rejected thee from being King amen
[9:19] hallelujah now if we flip that into the
[9:22] uh other positive point is if we have
[9:25] accepted the word of the
[9:26] Lord then he has appointed us as his
[9:29] Queen
[9:30] am amen he rejected Saul because he
[9:33] rejected the word and he rejected him
[9:35] from being King so we know the
[9:38] denominational world has been rejected
[9:41] amen God has rejected them because they
[9:43] have rejected the word but a people have
[9:45] come through a corridor have come
[9:47] through a passage way that's been made
[9:50] for them amen because all of the P
[9:53] cankerworm Locust and caterpillar has
[9:55] eaten God says I will restore am amen
[9:59] and God started the restoration by
[10:01] opening up a frontier opening up a
[10:03] passageway for us through
[10:05] Luther and he opened up the first work
[10:08] of Grace which was called justification
[10:10] now remember as we've been teaching you
[10:12] that Luther brought the word
[10:13] justification but he didn't get the full
[10:16] revelation of the word amen but when
[10:18] brother brandham comes and he is to
[10:20] reveal all Mysteries he takes that word
[10:23] justification and he magnifies that word
[10:26] justification and he says justification
[10:28] he says though you've never done it in
[10:30] the first place he says in the Rapture
[10:33] message now standing there to be married
[10:36] to the Son of
[10:38] God Amen Hallelujah so justification
[10:42] moves you past forgiveness of sins and
[10:46] it's as though you've never sinned in
[10:47] the first place hallelujah amen thank so
[10:51] if you've never sinned in the first
[10:52] place then God has cast it into the sea
[10:54] of forgetfulness amen hallelujah so
[10:57] brother brand magnify justification he
[11:00] he tied up the loose hand and he brought
[11:02] the true meaning of justification it's
[11:05] as though you've never sinned in the
[11:06] first place so your first birth was
[11:09] analed God don't consider your first
[11:11] birth if you are born again you are born
[11:13] again amen your past is taken care of
[11:17] thank you Lord then brother Brandon
[11:19] comes we know now we're talking about
[11:21] the Philadelphia Corridor and I'll tell
[11:23] you why just now but he says uh Wesley
[11:26] opened up another passage way he took it
[11:29] past
[11:31] Luther amen and he brought the message
[11:34] of
[11:35] sanctification hallelujah amen he
[11:37] brought that message of sanctification
[11:39] but brother it wasn't just amen the
[11:41] blood of Jesus and good works like the
[11:44] Methodist Church thought must do now
[11:46] they said feed the hungry amen clothe
[11:48] the poor and visit those that I need in
[11:51] hospitals in prison they went on a
[11:54] method but brother Bram comes and he
[11:57] takes sanctification because he's the
[11:59] the eagle of the age and he zooms into
[12:01] sanctification and he talks about the
[12:03] blood he says the literal life of the
[12:06] the literal blood dried up but the life
[12:08] that was in the blood amen has come upon
[12:11] the believer in the form of the Holy
[12:13] Ghost and then he says then you are
[12:15] Sanctified amen how by the Holy Ghost
[12:19] sanctification
[12:21] amen then we know the passage way is
[12:24] made up now William Simo and all of
[12:25] these people start in the zza Street
[12:27] Revival pushing the B ERS pushing the
[12:30] territory forward
[12:32] amen amen what is it advancing the
[12:35] kingdom of God moving with the holy
[12:38] spirit amen then they denominated and
[12:41] they said the initial evidence is
[12:42] speaking in tongues but now the Propet
[12:44] to the age the eye of the age comes and
[12:46] says it's beyond speaking in
[12:49] tongues he moved the Holy Ghost
[12:51] interpretation from Beyond speaking in
[12:53] tongues amen hallelujah he showed you
[12:57] how the angel of God is the Holy Ghost
[13:00] amen he took it further Hallelujah he
[13:03] showed you the movings of the Holy Ghost
[13:05] he taught us these things higher
[13:07] dimensions in the Holy Ghost until he
[13:09] brought it to such an elevated level
[13:11] where he says you receiving the word for
[13:14] your age in your time and your season
[13:16] that's the true evidence that you have
[13:18] received the Holy
[13:20] Ghost hallelujah what is it magnifying
[13:24] the borders amen enlarging our borders
[13:26] enlarging our understanding amen taking
[13:29] away the trinitarian doctrine amen and
[13:31] bringing the true revelation of the
[13:33] godhead how God condescended from Spirit
[13:36] to word to flesh amen amen hallelujah
[13:40] how we bypassed our theop body and now
[13:43] we are going back amen from flesh will
[13:45] connect with our theophany body and go
[13:47] back to that word body amen a glorified
[13:51] body praise the Lord so we have to be
[13:55] mindful of the movings of the Holy
[13:57] Ghost and now he says when the church
[14:00] has shut the door Lan church has shut
[14:04] the door yes amen
[14:08] amen they shut the door but we know that
[14:12] God opened the door in that sixth Church
[14:14] age he said I've set before you an Open
[14:16] Door amen but latest year in church shut
[14:20] the
[14:22] door but there's got to be a people who
[14:24] go to reopen that door amen amen
[14:28] hallelujah amen that have not
[14:31] denominated oh yes a mighty Army has
[14:33] risen up Amen to take back oh yes Lord
[14:37] to destroy the works of the enemy now if
[14:40] you remember last week I that's why I
[14:42] say sometimes we we do things we say
[14:44] things without knowing what we are doing
[14:46] but we are following the leadings of the
[14:47] Holy Spirit and I took a scripture and I
[14:49] showed you how David went to rescue
[14:52] hostages his wife and children and all
[14:54] the these men were taken hostage their
[14:57] wives were taken hostage then then when
[14:59] we go home you see that Israel also
[15:01] found
[15:02] hostages they found six
[15:05] hostages right amen but if you go and
[15:08] magnify that story and read that story
[15:10] you'll see exactly what is happening now
[15:13] amen and we read there how the Lord told
[15:17] David to go and pursue the enemy right
[15:20] oh yes to utterly slay and Destroy amen
[15:23] yes Lord hallelujah yeah now you would
[15:27] know that October
[15:30] 7th amen started a persecution upon the
[15:34] Jews one like they've never seen
[15:37] since the
[15:39] Holocaust praise the
[15:41] Lord amen
[15:44] amen you know that they were terrorist
[15:46] and camped within the land of
[15:49] Israel called the Gaza Strip yeah and
[15:53] they were using there as underground
[15:56] tunnels now I'm not just trying to bring
[15:58] politics into this I'm showing you that
[15:59] in spiritual Israel terrorist have
[16:02] infiltrated the
[16:03] ranks underground channels launching
[16:07] attacks strategic
[16:09] attacks
[16:11] amen praise the Lord
[16:14] amen when the devil tried to take away
[16:16] the gifts the moving of the Holy Spirit
[16:18] from the church the church stayed
[16:21] quiet if the devil said no more speaking
[16:24] in
[16:24] tongues no more praying for the sick
[16:28] intellectual Giants Rose and listen to
[16:30] that
[16:31] word now I love you know Mark 16 is not
[16:34] just about healing alone put up Mark 16
[16:37] brother as soon as you say Mark 16
[16:39] people try to think it's it's a BL it's
[16:42] a healing of the sick alone I'll show
[16:45] it's for the Deliverance of the Sons and
[16:47] Daughters of God
[16:49] Amen praise the Lord so Mark
[16:52] 16 amen we can put from verse uh maybe
[16:55] from 13 14 somewhere there
[16:58] okay uh maybe 15 I think it is he said
[17:02] go into all the world and preach the
[17:04] gospel to Every Creature right he that
[17:07] believeth and baptized shall be
[17:10] saved how many if you can see salvation
[17:12] there am so when you say Mark 16 people
[17:14] just think oh he's trying to trying to
[17:16] operate a
[17:18] gift Mark 16 is talking about preaching
[17:21] the gospel those that believe being
[17:24] baptized and you carrying the true
[17:26] revelation of baptism will baptize them
[17:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ am
[17:31] amen he that believeth not shall be
[17:33] damned so he's bringing condemnation as
[17:35] well so there's more to Mark 16 than
[17:38] just what we
[17:40] think and these signs shall follow them
[17:43] that believe number one in my name they
[17:46] shall cast out devils and I think that's
[17:48] what's probably the problem they don't
[17:49] want us to cast out Devils maybe we need
[17:52] to cast out religious demons amen
[17:54] [Music]
[17:56] amen amen in my name they shall cast out
[17:59] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[18:02] amen oh there's more now there's not
[18:05] just healing here I if you can see that
[18:07] amen it's a casting out of devils it's a
[18:09] speaking with new tongues amen they
[18:11] shall take up serpents amen and if they
[18:14] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[18:18] them now at the end they shall lay hands
[18:20] on the sick and they shall
[18:23] recover so don't try and make Mark 16
[18:26] just a healing scripture it's for the
[18:29] Deliverance amen of a person for the
[18:32] Salvation of a person amen for the
[18:34] healing of a person yes praise the Lord
[18:37] I if you know Deliverance of spirits he
[18:39] going beyond the healing of the flesh he
[18:41] going to the spirit
[18:43] realm Hallelujah and how many of you
[18:45] know Salvation is going beyond the
[18:46] spirit realm and going into the realm of
[18:48] the Soul amen so I'll take you into a
[18:51] deeper meaning of Mark 16 and show you
[18:53] it's dealing with Body Spirit and soul
[18:56] amen Wonder praise the Lord amen amen
[19:01] hallelujah amen thank you Lord and
[19:05] sometimes we do things and maybe
[19:06] thinking it's out of season it's out of
[19:07] time I'll show you amen when people have
[19:10] faith in God God will honor their word
[19:13] God will honor their faith amen what we
[19:15] have is too many backslid people that
[19:17] are satisfied with the status quo and
[19:19] not ready to push the borders of Faith
[19:22] Jesus said when I come back will I find
[19:23] faith on the earth not just sitting
[19:25] around laying idle brother Bram says
[19:27] indoors indoors amen paragraph 87 if you
[19:30] put it up I like a man with vision I
[19:33] like a man with purpose I like a man who
[19:35] knows what he's doing not just laying
[19:37] around sitting saying oh whatever will
[19:39] be will be he says oh be up and add
[19:43] it he says find a purpose and go and do
[19:46] something about it amen thank you Lord
[19:49] praise the Lord thank you Lord yeah for
[19:52] those if you want to read it I like a
[19:53] man of vision I like people that's got
[19:55] something they're fighting for not just
[19:57] laying around well whatever comes along
[19:59] you know we've been along in this Riot
[20:01] so long 30 years 40 years we'll just see
[20:04] what the Lord will do God puts you on
[20:06] the earth to do something about it God
[20:08] has commissioned you under Revelation
[20:10] 108 to11 thou must prophesy again yes
[20:14] Lord thank you Lord amen you keep
[20:16] waiting for God Amen God told the
[20:18] prophet what do you keep waiting around
[20:20] for you remember he was trying to find
[20:22] the vision for sister Wood's mother or
[20:25] mother-in-law and he says I went to the
[20:27] scripture I went to pray and the Lord
[20:29] came back with a sharp word of rebuke
[20:31] why do you keep hanging around why do
[20:32] you keep waiting for me to
[20:34] move he says I've given you my word amen
[20:37] my word is higher than any Vision amen
[20:40] my word is the primary source amen
[20:42] hallelujah amen amen oh be up and at it
[20:46] some of us need to be up and at it this
[20:48] morning some of us need to be up and at
[20:50] it in our lives amen amen have a vision
[20:52] have a purpose for our lives find the
[20:55] vision of God for our

[27:38] think it's out of season out of
[27:41] time let's see some scriptures and see
[27:43] if God answers out of season out of time
[27:46] and behold a woman of Canaan came out of
[27:48] the same coast and Cried unto him saying
[27:51] have mercy on me oh Lord th son of David
[27:53] my daughter is grievously vexed with a
[27:55] devil now does that seem like anything
[27:57] wrong the daughter is demon possessed
[28:00] she wants
[28:02] prayer but he answered her not a word
[28:04] and his disciples came and besought him
[28:06] that sounds rude now that sounds rude
[28:09] you're talking to Jesus he doesn't even
[28:11] answer
[28:13] you and his disciples came and besought
[28:15] him saying send her away for she crith
[28:19] after us and he answered and said I am
[28:22] not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[28:24] House of
[28:26] Israel then she came then then came she
[28:28] and worshiped him saying Lord help
[28:33] me but he answered and said it is not me
[28:36] to take the children's bread and cast it
[28:38] to
[28:39] dogs and she said truth Lord yet the
[28:42] dogs eat the crumbs which fall from
[28:45] their master's table amen humble
[28:47] yourself hallelujah amen we read that
[28:51] scripture humble yourself before the
[28:52] Lord amen
[28:53] amen it changes Jesus just declared
[28:58] he's going to change his word now he
[29:00] just said I haven't come for you your
[29:04] Greeks I've come for the L ship of
[29:06] Israel This Woman's response made Jesus
[29:09] change his mind amen oh yes makes him
[29:13] respond out of season it wasn't season
[29:15] for them
[29:17] yet oh yes then Jesus answered and said
[29:21] unto oh woman great is thy faith your
[29:24] faith is going to pull you into season
[29:26] amen amen H amen yes be unto thee even
[29:31] as thou Wilt amen that sounds like Eddie
[29:34] right Hallelujah yes be it unto thee
[29:37] according to thy will as you will and a
[29:40] daughter was made all from that very
[29:42] hour amen praise the Lord yes thank you
[29:46] amen oh he's worthy to be praised amen
[29:49] amen hallelujah our god is King amen
[29:53] let's go to the book of uh Mark amen
[30:00] amen praise the Lord Mark chapter 7 okay
[30:04] sorry that's the same scripture maybe I
[30:06] want to go to another scripture here
[30:09] amen that's just the reading of the same
[30:10] scripture sorry
[30:13] amen let's go to Mark
[30:21] 11 it seems unreasonable for the one who
[30:24] created all things to go and ask for
[30:26] things out of season and yeah verse 13
[30:29] and seeing a fig tree a far off having
[30:30] leaves he came by Apple he might find
[30:33] anything there on and when he came to it
[30:36] he found nothing but leaves for the time
[30:38] of figs was not
[30:40] yet and Jesus answered and said unto it
[30:43] no man eat fruit of thee thereafter
[30:45] forever and his disciples heard it you
[30:48] know what happened to that tree it
[30:49] withered to the roots I am saying Jesus
[30:52] also understands he can ask for things
[30:53] out of season
[30:58] sir amen
[31:00] hallelujah now that was a a spiritual
[31:03] type there because the victory is Israel
[31:06] and Jesus had come to Israel and they
[31:08] were not bearing fruit yet so didn't
[31:10] they get
[31:11] cursed amen hallelujah so that was just
[31:15] a figurative type there amen praise the
[31:18] Lord amen he's worthy to be praised amen
[31:21] I think it's in the book of Luke one
[31:22] more scripture I want to go to here
[31:24] hallelujah
[31:28] Luke
[31:34] 11 Luke chap 11 verse5 he says and he
[31:37] said unto them which of you shall have a
[31:39] friend and shall go unto him at midnight
[31:42] and say unto him friend lend me three
[31:44] loaves now he's going at An Inconvenient
[31:47] hour we can call it out of season right
[31:50] for a friend of mine is in his journey
[31:52] and he's come to me and I have nothing
[31:54] to set before
[31:55] him and he from within shall answer and
[31:58] say trouble me not the door is now shut
[32:01] and my children are with me in bed I
[32:03] cannot rise and give thee so he's
[32:06] already made his declaration a man is as
[32:08] good as his
[32:10] word I say unto you though he will rise
[32:13] not and give him because he is his
[32:15] friend yet because of the
[32:17] importunity he will rise and give him as
[32:20] many as he
[32:22] need and I say unto you ask amen amen
[32:26] and it shall be given to you
[32:29] amen and he that seeketh find it amen
[32:34] and and seek and you shall find knock
[32:35] and it shall be open unto you for
[32:37] everyone that ask receiveth and he that
[32:40] seeketh find it and to him that knocketh
[32:42] it shall be open if a son shall ask
[32:45] bread of you any of you that is a father
[32:47] will you give him a stone or if he ask a
[32:50] fish will he will he for a fish give him
[32:52] a serpent or if he ask for an egg will
[32:55] he offer him a scorpion if he then being
[32:57] evil know how to give good gifts unto
[32:59] your children how much more shall your
[33:02] heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to
[33:04] them that ask him you see why we have
[33:07] lack in our lives we don't
[33:12] ask if there's anyone in lack here this
[33:15] morning we are not asking the
[33:17] Lord and you know that I think it's in
[33:19] the book of James it says sometimes you
[33:21] ask but you ask a
[33:23] Miss
[33:25] amen the reason why you don't have you
[33:28] ask
[33:29] not and you seek not he says seek now
[33:33] let me declare that that's a
[33:35] law that's a law on the earth God placed
[33:38] that law there ask and you shall receive
[33:41] you can go with that scriptural
[33:42] authority to the Lord and say Lord your
[33:44] word declares ask and you shall
[33:47] receive seek and you shall find knock
[33:51] when doors are closed behold I set
[33:53] before you an open door he says the door
[33:55] will be open to you I don't care how
[33:57] many doors have closed before you before

[34:07] Angel of the Lord right now every door
[34:09] shall be made Open Lord thank you Jesus

[35:33] the mighty Angel is year in our time of
[35:35] trouble amen and we showed you through
[35:37] the scriptures how the prophet
[35:40] took Psalm 27 in the Rapture message to
[35:43] show you that he shall hide me in his
[35:45] Pavilion in the time of trouble so he's
[35:47] showing you even at the Rapture there's
[35:49] a time of trouble and the prophet calls
[35:51] it not a tribulation for the bride but
[35:53] the hour of Temptation amen if we've got
[35:56] time we'll go into some of that the hour
[35:58] of Temptation that has now come upon the
[35:59] bride so I just want you to to
[36:02] understand brother Joshua amen you

[36:14] unrecognized I am saying we are changing
[36:17] that am we didn't we preach strategic
[36:20] alliance with the Unseen World being
[36:22] sensitive to the to how the angels of
[36:24] God are moving right now connecting with

[36:31] of Israel he is still here amen the
[36:34] angel of God that went before the camp
[36:36] of Israel removed and went back behind
[36:38] him and the pull of cloud went from
[36:40] behind their face and stood behind them
[36:43] right watch what he says is a go between
[36:46] in the time of
[36:48] trouble so who answered your prayer
[36:50] brother Joshua it was the go between in
[36:53] a time of
[36:54] trouble amen praise the Lord amen so

[39:28] would you do if you saw yourself
[39:29] surrounded people with guns and knives

[44:39] the third pool
[44:42] is anyone wants me to break it down for
[44:44] them very
[44:46] quickly cuz the third pool is not a
[44:48] mysterious thing for Sons it shouldn't
[44:50] be mysterious for daughters of
[44:54] god let's see if I can do it in 2
[44:56] minutes ah 2 minutes deep mysterious
[44:59] people take services for
[45:03] this how many if you want me to do it in
[45:05] two minutes so let's go to the root of
[45:08] the truth brother brandham is given uh
[45:10] the angel of God meets brother Bram and
[45:12] he tells him you'll be given three uh uh
[45:14] the first and second pool sign in your
[45:16] hand discernment of spirits right then
[45:19] you know he messed up that two pools and
[45:21] he said you explain the gift too
[45:23] much right now the important thing you
[45:26] understand here is is that pull is a
[45:28] fishing
[45:28] [Music]
[45:30] term
[45:31] hello if you read the root of the story
[45:34] pull is a fishing term so he was going
[45:36] to pull the first time and he caught
[45:38] small fish the I want you to know that
[45:41] the fish is you yes he was a fisherman
[45:44] Jesus said I'll make you fishes of
[45:46] men everybody understand that the fish
[45:49] is typing mankind for salvation he was
[45:52] going to make his first pool but he
[45:53] caught small
[45:54] fish right you know under the second
[45:56] pool he Tangled the
[45:59] lines he explained the gift to much
[46:01] caral impersonations rose up so under
[46:03] the second pull he did he got people
[46:05] that were after the gifts only they were
[46:07] not after the word but he says now don't
[46:10] fail on the third pull because at the
[46:13] third pool you'll get the rainbow trout
[46:15] amen now what need is it for me to come
[46:19] and make a mysterious explanation about
[46:20] the third pull when the rainbow TR is
[46:22] already sitting here you already pulled
[46:25] out amen yes didn't his message pull you
[46:29] out amen so the third pool got you
[46:35] amen yes now can I make the third pool
[46:38] more mysterious than
[46:39] that the third pool pull you out of your
[46:43] religion pull you out of your
[46:45] denomination pull you out of the
[46:48] world am people don't like simple
[46:52] preaching they want it deep and
[46:54] mysterious
[46:57] but the third pool you have responded to
[46:59] the third pool already you know the
[47:01] that's like the wild Revival people
[47:03] asking where's the third pool I'm
[47:04] looking for the third pool you're
[47:06] looking at the product of a third
[47:08] pool Hallelujah I've already been pulled
[47:11] out so let the next Theologian come and
[47:13] explain to you mysteriously about the
[47:15] third pool say brother I've already come
[47:17] out under the third
[47:19] pool it was the word that brought me out
[47:22] I'm sitting here now and you're trying
[47:24] to explain to me something that's
[47:25] mysterious
[47:28] amen let's let's not try and be
[47:30] intellectual in the message of the hour
[47:33] God he works in
[47:34] Simplicity hallelujah praise the Lord so
[47:38] I don't know if I did that in 2 minutes
[47:40] but now you know what the third pull is
[47:42] it was a message to pull you out to call
[47:45] you for the
[47:47] Rapture
[47:51] amen you're not happy with that
[47:55] explanation it's okay okay let's go
[47:58] on so that same Angel so what I was
[48:01] trying to tell you people are saying oh
[48:02] why don't we wait I just showed you the
[48:04] scriptures you can't wait God called you
[48:06] for this time in
[48:07] season you know who wants you to
[48:10] wait let me tell you your adversary the
[48:16] devil because if you awaken to your
[48:18] anointing in this hour oh yes he he has
[48:20] to leave bodies yes he has to dispossess
[48:23] bodies because you'll be casting out
[48:25] demons amen yes
[48:28] Satan will have to find other bodies
[48:30] demon powers will have to find other
[48:31] bodies demon powers have attached
[48:33] themselves illegally you know any spir
[48:35] any demon power attaches themselves
[48:37] illegally to a person they have no
[48:40] authority to be in a person's body yes
[48:43] and the person has a right to give them
[48:44] legal notice to leave this body but
[48:47] people are satisfied with demon powers
[48:49] possessing them you know we were out
[48:51] there doing an Outreach at the plaza and
[48:53] I I I I was telling brother Joshua said
[48:55] watch we were talking to the drunk man
[48:58] he says oh I just want to get out of
[49:00] this he wasn't drunk there you could see
[49:01] he was like kind of sobered up but he
[49:03] says I have a problem with drinking I
[49:04] have this thing I said can you repeat
[49:06] after me I told him you demon of
[49:12] alcohol I do not give you legal
[49:14] authority over my body he said you demon
[49:17] of alcohol and as soon as I said I do
[49:19] not give you he couldn't say any more he
[49:21] was
[49:24] like the demon power was restricting him
[49:27] from making a declaration to cast him
[49:31] out cuz demon powers attach themselves
[49:33] illegally to your body yes they come in
[49:36] the form of sickness disease now they
[49:39] come with fancy names diabetes eye blood
[49:42] pressure amen cancer heart
[49:46] trouble
[49:49] fibroids there's probably tons of names
[49:52] maybe I can't get to them now but they
[49:53] are demon powers you say demon power I
[49:56] not give you authority to attach
[49:58] yourself to my body leave in the name of
[50:01] Jesus Amen yes L amen I don't know if
[50:04] we're going to get through this quote
[50:05] amen but I want you to see how the angel
[50:07] of God is working and there to equip you
[50:09] with the word of
[50:11] God he says to do exactly what Jesus did
[50:14] in that day he's here to confirm just
[50:16] what he did then he's here now will
[50:18] always be the same the angel of God
[50:20] moving up to stand between us and the
[50:22] sickness standing between us and death
[50:25] no wonder David said he walk through the
[50:27] valley of the shadow of death I'll fear
[50:28] no evil he says standing there the angel
[50:30] of God went before the camp of Israel
[50:33] removed and went stood between them and
[50:35] the enemy and the angel of God Is
[50:36] Standing tonight between every
[50:38] individual year and the enemy I know
[50:41] what I'm speaking of I know while
[50:43] standing here now on the platform before
[50:45] this little group of people tonight I
[50:47] know that God is condescended coming
[50:49] down from glory and standing in this
[50:51] building now if you'll only dare move
[50:53] out to God's word see if you don't move
[50:56] before you
[50:58] watch amen amen so if you can rise up to
[51:02] the word now the angel of God is here
[51:05] Amen Let me close with this amen this
[51:08] was going to take a big portion of the
[51:11] service but I'm just amen as the Lord
[51:14] leads I'll just speak this amen very
[51:21] quickly so what am I talking about the
[51:23] Philadelphia
[51:25] Corridor when you know that Philadelphia
[51:27] was the age of Brotherly
[51:29] Love but the brandom calls it that the
[51:32] age of brotherly love amen how many of
[51:35] you can say Amen to that
[51:38] amen amen it was the age of Brotherly
[51:41] [Music]
[51:48] Love and he says that now think about it
[51:51] where is Brotherly Love placed on the
[51:53] pyramid under what age
[51:58] it was placed under the seventh age
[52:00] under L brotherly kindness but the sixth
[52:04] Church age is called brotherly
[52:07] love what I'm going trying to show you
[52:09] is that brother BR says the door was
[52:11] opened in the sixth Church
[52:14] age right under the Philadelphian Church
[52:18] age
[52:23] amen so we know that age started from
[52:26] 1750 to
[52:28] 1906 and it's called the age of
[52:29] Brotherly Love Philadelphia means love
[52:32] of Brethren now watch I'm going to go
[52:34] very quickly because I don't have time I
[52:35] probably got like 5
[52:39] minutes
[52:40] right natural Israel has declared if you
[52:44] watch Benjamin Yan's speech
[52:48] yesterday because he knows all nations
[52:50] now ganging up against him right now he
[52:52] doesn't even know if Israel is going to
[52:54] stand with him because they don't know
[52:55] who the next leader is going to
[52:59] be the reason I'm telling you this it's
[53:02] almost time for us to leave here yes
[53:06] amen
[53:08] okay but watch the name Philadelphia
[53:10] comes
[53:13] up so they are saying if you watch his
[53:16] speech he had three points he says we've
[53:18] got to control the Philadelphia
[53:21] Corridor because the Philadelphia
[53:24] Corridor is the border between Egypt and
[53:29] Gaza if they don't control the Border
[53:31] there's three things that's going to
[53:32] happen now right what was last week's
[53:35] sermon message by the way utterly slay
[53:38] and destroy the
[53:39] enemy using your word seed amen right
[53:44] now their goal and their mission is to
[53:45] utterly slay and Destroy
[53:48] amas they say in times past under Camp
[53:50] David and different camps they had peace
[53:52] negotiations they were told why don't
[53:54] you leave this region if they ever fire
[53:56] a rocket you can come back he says this
[53:57] time we will
[54:00] not now watch very important now yes's
[54:03] Benjamin a
[54:05] benjamite his name is Benjamin right and
[54:08] and we know that Saul was a
[54:10] benjamite but coming soon was the King
[54:13] David amen amen from the tribe of
[54:17] Judah so this guy is probably the last
[54:20] prime minister in Israel called Benjamin
[54:22] but who's coming as
[54:23] King the lion of the tribe of Judah the
[54:26] son of
[54:30] David amen I'm trying to condense my
[54:33] thoughts so I can give it to you very
[54:34] quickly so he says to in order to
[54:37] maintain peace in this region now
[54:39] remember there were hostages
[54:42] taken now remember the message preached
[54:44] brother Joshua strengthening our
[54:46] borders why do we need to strengthen the
[54:48] Philadelphia border then because the
[54:50] hostages that were taken they're going
[54:52] to take them out to Egypt
[54:57] what is Egypt
[54:59] typing the prophet says Egypt types the
[55:02] world I'm trying to show you natural and
[55:04] spiritual so you got to work very
[55:05] quickly with me spiritually demon powers
[55:08] want to take Souls captive and take them
[55:11] back into the
[55:12] world but we must maintain the
[55:14] Philadelphia Corridor amen so that these
[55:17] ostriches cannot leave Gaza amen even if
[55:20] people are possessed even if people are
[55:22] bound right now we must maintain our
[55:25] borders the ERS of the message of the
[55:27] hour we must stand strong and fight for
[55:29] their Deliverance am yes amen amen amen
[55:34] we can't be selfish in our thinking we
[55:35] must fight for our brothers and our
[55:37] sisters we must fight for the
[55:39] Deliverance yes Lord amen
[55:42] amen amen what we are doing right now is
[55:45] fighting for your deliverance fighting
[55:47] amen for your freedom amen there are
[55:49] still people land hostage there 117 of
[55:52] them still
[55:58] praise the
[56:01] Lord so they want to get them so they
[56:04] say the only way that we can let me read
[56:06] to you is three
[56:08] things he says these are three War goals
[56:12] and you watch how perfectly it's typing
[56:13] with every sermon that has come forth he
[56:15] says the first goal is to destroy amma's
[56:17] military and governing
[56:20] capabilities they want to destroy
[56:22] amma's military and governing
[56:25] capabilities what was last week's
[56:26] message utterly slay and
[56:29] destroy the second was to free our
[56:34] hostages and I was telling you that John
[56:37] who possesses the book is going to call
[56:39] the names in the
[56:40] booken to free the hostages that are
[56:43] held in sin to free the ones that were
[56:45] born in sin shaped in iniquity came into
[56:47] this world speaking lies maybe don't
[56:49] know about a message of the hour but
[56:51] John who has the book of redemption must
[56:53] now prophesy again and call those names
[56:55] that are in the book am amen amen so the
[56:59] second war goal is to free the hostages
[57:02] the third war goal is to ensure that
[57:05] Gaza never again poses a threat to
[57:09] Israel what is that strengthening our
[57:11] borders yes forming a strategic alliance
[57:14] with the Unseen World amen amen so that
[57:18] the enemy will never again possess a
[57:22] threat to us
[57:24] am thank you Lord
[57:26] I don't know if you can see spiritually
[57:28] Israel have already spoken these things
[57:30] and now naturally Israel speaks these
[57:32] things three War goals
[57:34] amen now why must we maintain the
[57:37] Philadelphia Corridor you may be saying
[57:39] amen because if you put it up
[57:42] there these things are on a paragraphs
[57:44] brother you're going to find it
[57:48] amen now getting back to the open
[57:50] Mission door of Philadelphian age it's
[57:52] right I think it starts of the quote
[57:54] there
[57:56] right I just want to show you this very
[57:58] quickly and we're going to close he says
[58:00] now getting back to the open Mission
[58:01] door of the Philadelphian age it did not
[58:04] have an Open Door of power it ought to
[58:07] have had I think there's a lack of power
[58:10] somewhere hey notice in the same verse
[58:13] he mentions this open door he says thou
[58:16] has little strength that's right the
[58:17] power of the spirit was missing in that
[58:21] age the word was well preached ah how
[58:25] many you can think think of some places
[58:27] where the word is well preached in the
[58:29] framework of our ranks but the power of
[58:33] the spirit is
[58:35] missing it is well able to make Souls
[58:38] wise unto salvation but the great power
[58:41] of God that showed forth his mighty
[58:42] works that made bear his arm in behalf
[58:45] of his o own was missing except amongst
[58:48] the scattered
[58:50] groups yet praise God it was growing and
[58:53] increased over what they had in the
[58:55] Reformation
[58:57] I'm going to close now amen
[59:00] hallelujah so this is what I want to get
[59:02] to in order to understand behold I set
[59:05] before an open door and no man can shut
[59:07] it we must now recall what has been said
[59:09] about each age running over into another
[59:13] age the overlap of the
[59:15] [Music]
[59:16] age there is an overlapping a melting or
[59:20] Fading
[59:21] Into rather than an Abrupt end and a
[59:24] clearcut star
[59:27] this age particularly flows into the
[59:29] next age and not only does this age
[59:32] overflow into the last and not only does
[59:35] this age overflow into the last age but
[59:37] the last age is in many respects simply
[59:40] a carrying on of the sixth
[59:46] age you see why I'm saying we've got to
[59:48] maintain control of the Philadelphian
[59:51] border the Philadelphian
[59:53] Corridor yes
[59:57] because it's the age carrying on so what
[59:59] am I saying all our borders are be
[1:00:01] possessed justification sanctification
[1:00:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost now coming
[1:00:06] into the formed word image we must
[1:00:07] maintain these borders amen we can't go
[1:00:10] back into the world we can't be amen
[1:00:12] going backslid now amen we've got to be
[1:00:15] getting stronger in the faith we've got
[1:00:17] to be going
[1:00:19] higher
[1:00:21] you
[1:00:23] amen going to close now as I said
[1:00:27] the seventh age a very short age gathers
[1:00:31] up into itself for one quick work all
[1:00:34] the evil of every age and yet all the
[1:00:36] reality of
[1:00:38] Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has
[1:00:40] run about its course the latan age comes
[1:00:43] in quickly bringing both the tears and
[1:00:45] the wheat to harvest now what did the
[1:00:48] Lord say you'll send the Reapers into
[1:00:51] the field and he'll gather the wheat
[1:00:54] first what did he say
[1:00:59] so come on there's only two things now
[1:01:00] wheat or tears did he say we'll gather
[1:01:02] the tears first or the wheat
[1:01:04] first he said We Gather the tears first
[1:01:08] I want to tell you in the last few years
[1:01:10] what you've been witnessing people say
[1:01:12] why I left the message you didn't leave
[1:01:14] the
[1:01:15] message the reaper was here the reaping
[1:01:17] angel came to gather the
[1:01:19] tears that's right and he's plucking out
[1:01:23] the tears
[1:01:26] don't get disheartened if you see people
[1:01:29] leaving scripture has come to pass he
[1:01:32] says I will gather the tears
[1:01:35] first so big renowned names people that
[1:01:38] preach the message I'm leaving you do
[1:01:40] not
[1:01:44] leaving you are not leaving don't be
[1:01:47] mistaken The Reaping Angel is taking you
[1:01:51] out so rather go humbly gracefully don't
[1:01:54] say I'm leaving you're not leaving you
[1:01:55] rather go your leg
[1:01:57] be you're not leave you can't leave the
[1:02:01] message the angel took you out
[1:02:04] that's but we
[1:02:07] remain so which means our gathering is
[1:02:10] next hallelujah amen if we can see the
