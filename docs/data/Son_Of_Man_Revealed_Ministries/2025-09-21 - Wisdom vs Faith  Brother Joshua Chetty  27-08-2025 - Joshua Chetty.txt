Angels [Music] in all around. Let us praise Jesus. Now [Music] we are standing in his presence on holy ground. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you father. Father, we know that where you are tonight &gt;&gt; and where we are right now, Lord, &gt;&gt; holy ground, &gt;&gt; because Lord, your presence is here amongst your children, oh God, &gt;&gt; where two or three are gathered in your name. &gt;&gt; You promise to be in our midst, Father. Amen. Hallelujah. And Lord, we know that we Lord are a dwelling place for you, the great Holy Spirit that's here amongst us, dwelling in your people, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; and the place becomes holy, oh God, because if the holy God is amongst your people tonight, &gt;&gt; and Father, we know that if you are here tonight, oh God, oh, there will be no feeble amongst us tonight, oh God. And right now, we know there's many needs right now. And father, there's many sick and afflicted amongst us, Father. But Lord, it's a work that you have already done upon the cross of Calvary, Lord. It's a finished work of God. And Lord, we know tonight we have rightful claims to claim our redemptive blessings, Father. It's a work that you have done. And right now, we claim our healing in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We know, Lord, that you are more than able &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; To heal out of every infirmity, oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. from every attack of the enemy, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And if the Holy Ghost is here right now and Lord, we learn to God that his sicknesses come from germs and diseases which are Lord come from spirits, oh God. And we pray right now that your Holy Spirit will drive out the spirit in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have no rightful place over the children of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we claim healing over bodies tonight &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ name. Oh, we believe your word, Lord. We don't want to believe the word of man, but we believe your word, oh God. We believe your report, oh God, &gt;&gt; and your report is a finished work, oh God. &gt;&gt; You see our imperfection, oh God. Lord, &gt;&gt; oh blessed be your wonderful name. Lord, we know, we are so grateful, oh God, that you, Lord, come down to be touched by the feelings of our infirmities, oh God. &gt;&gt; You know every need of your children, oh God. You know the things that we have need of. And Lord, we know that you want to meet with every need, oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're a father that loves us so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you want to provide for your children, oh God. You want to give us all the things that we have need of, for God, &gt;&gt; because Lord, you've given us every promise in your word. Nothing you withheld from us, oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tonight, as we've come, Lord, we submit to you. We yield to you, oh God, and we pray that you'll come and speak to our hearts, oh God. Let it be a refreshing of your Holy Spirit, oh God. Let your anointing come upon your people, oh God, &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; through the preaching of your word. And Lord, when we go from this place, we will know, Lord, there's been a refreshing in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Greet you all, saints of God, in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh we know sometimes we get tired, we get weary in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because we are in the special house. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But we come to get refreshed &gt;&gt; in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We come to get filled. Amen. &gt;&gt; With his spirit more and more of him. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we know that when when we have this refreshing, it revives us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we come in this midweek meeting to get revived again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we get revived, we go on and we start burning with the fire of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So therefore we we've come and we and and we're not just gathered anyway. We're gathered with saints of like precious faith. &gt;&gt; We we are gathering with with those that love and hold dear to this wonderful message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That all the things of God dear to the hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That love God and love his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So we got our Bibles. We turn to the book of 1 Corinthians reading from chapter 2 verse 5. That's a short exhortation tonight that you'll be blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But in the power of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh the scripture Revelation 10:1, please don't get tired of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is an important scripture, instrumental scripture in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the scripture takes us, this is our seven seal scripture. This is a scripture that shows us that this was the time when a message has come our way. Amen. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open, and he set and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roared. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This scripture is not for everybody. It's for a peculiar people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's for a people that was going to be upon the earth that will receive title. &gt;&gt; It's not just for everybody. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Just for a short, I just want to speak on the prophet spoke this message, wisdom versus faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. wisdom versus faith. But we speak on the supernatural message of Revelation 10:1. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that this is a supernatural message. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; This is a message that you don't get out from any seminary. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; From any man-made doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not from some theologian. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or not by some man's intellectual understanding of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural message. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's for a supernatural people. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; A people that want eternal thoughts of God &gt;&gt; until God expressed his thoughts that they could be manifested upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. A people that walks out of his of his spoken words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That walks out of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are seeing we are living in an hour where it's an intellectual age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now we know to the teaching of the prophet of God and to the message of the hour we we don't believe in ignorance. We don't teach ignorance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But this is the type of wisdom we try to the when the prophet is speaking about this type of wisdom. It's the wisdom that will go against God &gt;&gt; because the things of God must be believed by faith. For without faith, it is impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is the grace of God that gives you faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't just go and say, "I want faith." &gt;&gt; It is the grace of God that gives you revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was just mentioning tonight I was looking at a family and I was telling my wife and how how I how I come in in the message in the early stages of coming to the message and there were three of us that went into the voice of God library to get message material. &gt;&gt; But from the three of us that went in, I was the only one that stayed in. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not because I had any intellectual understanding better than them. They were well informed of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; They were well learned in the scriptures and they to their understanding they loved they they claim to love God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I was predestinated for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The eyes of my understanding was enlightened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God had to open my understanding to see the time and hour that we living in &gt;&gt; to recognize my day and my message. &gt;&gt; Amen. It had nothing to do with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But I was predestinated for that hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I began to see my day and my message and the word rapture caught caught my attention that I knew that I always belong to this. This is part of me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the real me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, this message is not something insignificant. &gt;&gt; You coming across this message is the most supernatural thing that ever happened in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God has intended for you to come across this message because this message has a word to translate your body. &gt;&gt; Nothing else is going to translate your body. The best medicines are going to translate your body. The best doctor, they can do all this genetic transfer and so forth and they're trying to do change the DNA and so forth. They cannot change your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have a living word. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; In the wilderness there to survive, they had to have heavenly food, spiritual mana. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, mana from heaven. Amen. Angel food. &gt;&gt; For us to survive, the spirit man to survive because it's an eternal being. Amen. &gt;&gt; It has to have spiritual food. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What makes us the eternal beings is the eternal God dwelling in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. when the great Holy Ghost, the eternal being dwelling in us &gt;&gt; and to know that we are always being a part of him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In you is coded in your DNA. The the supernatural things of God. &gt;&gt; It's already coded in your genetic DNA. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you are partakers of his divine nature that was predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop that. Nothing would have stopped you from believing this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're predestinated. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; God work in times and seasons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And therefore you find you find sometimes when you look at life and you look at people and say look at that person who will never believe this message. They are so messed up. And then we are we're judging it with the eyes of man. We say no but this person they going to they going to church regularly. They are attending service regularly. Maybe if I go to that person, they would believe the message. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; You see, you're looking at it through wisdom of man. &gt;&gt; You're looking at it in the wrong way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When God can take the violent sinner, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; and transform his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at Peter at all. God did not Jesus did not look at him as man saw them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Peter was a vulgar person. &gt;&gt; He was there the fisherman. He was a rough man. &gt;&gt; But Jesus looked beyond that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is by predestination. Amen. &gt;&gt; We do not see man as the way man sees it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to look at it by discernment through the eyes of God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Samuel went to choose uh David as king when he was looking at all the other sons of Jesse, they all most of them fit the profile for him for according to man's concepts. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But there came a ry boy that was predestinated for a purpose. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That will change the cause of history in Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That will become a king that through that same throne. Amen. Come come the lineage of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there there we are right now seated right now and we are believing what we believe not through man's intellect. Amen. So we're looking at life man is believing on intellectual intellectual faith. &gt;&gt; What is intellectual faith? Satan if for Eve to for people to believe Satan they have they have to have some faith in him but it's not the faith of God. What I mean they have confidence in what they believe. They holding confidence to their wisdom. And people is holding confidence to man-made wisdom. &gt;&gt; And they are trying to interpret a supernatural message. &gt;&gt; With manmade wisdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; With man intellect, you cannot interpret the message that God send supernaturally. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to come in the same atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to come in the atmosphere of the composer. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to be one with the composer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to be aligned with this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to come into alignment. Your life got to come into alignment of the composer. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's bringing this message. &gt;&gt; You got to come in such alignment that you are coming to oneness with him. &gt;&gt; And then you can have his mind. Amen. And then you can know what's on the back part of God's mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where you no longer see yourself and every other person upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you find that many people you find that they were not predestinated to receive this and they'll say they will say you words like I am leaving this message &gt;&gt; but we don't you know that it was already spoken of in the Bible that there must be a falling away. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And there must be a plucking angel. Amen. &gt;&gt; To come and plug them out. So it's another man's made idea. This message, it's not a something that a person named William Brandom came and thought of this great idea. I'll bring a message to the people. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. This is a message from another world. &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mighty angel comes down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But before that, there had to be a work of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. There had to be a process of redemption. and a kinsman work to be done before this message can come upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the danger of it is men are trying to interpret it with human wisdom. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But this message can only be received by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Two seeds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Eden sets the stage. starts right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. The tree people want to invest their time from the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. Instead of the tree of life, &gt;&gt; which is now open freely. &gt;&gt; Amen. The cherubs are no block no longer blocking the tree of life. &gt;&gt; They are come they are open freely now if you come in the right way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come in the right way. Repent every one of you. Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the sh open. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Opens you now to the book of Acts. To the supernatural. Amen. To the power of God. &gt;&gt; But what they doing? What is man doing? Man is reasoning. &gt;&gt; He's looking at circumstances, &gt;&gt; but faith is resting on God's words. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the book of John chapter 10 verse one it says from book of John chapter 10 1-5 says verily verily I say unto you he that enterth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbth up some other way. &gt;&gt; The same is a thief and a robber. &gt;&gt; But he that enterth by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice. And he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadth them. And when he puteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For they know his voice, &gt;&gt; and the stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him. For they know not the voice of strangers. &gt;&gt; The voice will come with a seed of discrepancy. &gt;&gt; The voice will come to make you reason with the words. &gt;&gt; The voice that comes to make you weaken your faith. &gt;&gt; But you won't follow that voice. If you are part of, if you know the shepherd, Amen. If you know him, the word, you'll follow the words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a stranger will he not follow but will flee from him. For they know not the voice of strangers. They don't know any other voice. They only know the voice of God in this hour. Amen. When God is speaking through his words, the this parable spake Jesus unto them, but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers. But the sheep do not hear them. I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture. He says, "The thief cometh not but for steal and to kill and destroy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am come that they might have life and they might have it more abundantly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen. This message has come that we might have life and have it more abundantly. &gt;&gt; But the enemy wants to come and take you away from the things of God. He want to steal and destroy. &gt;&gt; But God is giving you a word of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's giving you an abundant life. He's giving you a message that will give you abundant life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's giving you a message that's going to take you out of the earth. &gt;&gt; That's going to translate your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the the enemy is trying now to come and steal and destroy that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he cannot destroy that word &gt;&gt; because it's an eternal word because he said heaven and earth will pass away but my word will still remain. He said let every man's word be a lie but my word be the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd given his life for the sheep. &gt;&gt; But he that is in high ling and not the shepherds whose own sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleth and the wolf catcheth them and scattered the sheep. You see if I can put this in a context in in now in in ministry you'll find that if your ministry don't have discernments and they see discrepancies coming in and they will leave the sheep to be with all the discrepancies but a a true ministry that the true five ministry would have discernment in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Will see the seed of the steppy coming in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they will recognize the steppy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he will protect the sheep from discrepancy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz God has put the true five-fold ministry. Cuz he is the true shepherd. Amen. And he must be here amongst them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It must be Christ leading the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The mighty angel must be here amongst our midst &gt;&gt; discerning every spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Discerning the spirit in the framework of the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Those that will use wisdom instead of faith. Those that will take reasoning, those that will reason with the word of God, those that will misre misrepresent the word of God, mislocate the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Misinterpreted. &gt;&gt; So he is hiding and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not. Seth the wolf coming and leave with the sheep and flee it. And the wolf catched them and scattered the sheep. The hiling fleth because he is an hiling and carth not for the sheep. &gt;&gt; I am the good shepherd and I know and know my sheep and am known of mine. &gt;&gt; As the father knoweth me, even so know I the father and I lay down my life for the sheep. And another and other sheep I have which are not of this fold. Them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice. And there shall be one fold and one shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So wisdom always takes you away from God. &gt;&gt; But faith makes you rest solemnly on God's word &gt;&gt; without wavering from it. &gt;&gt; He said Jesus said, "If you love me, you'll keep my words." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But wisdom looks at circumstances. They will try and and put their own interpretation and try to understand things. They want to want a scientific explanation of things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because you are living in an age where people are thought from university level now that you must have critical thinking to to to question everything. &gt;&gt; Sure. Now we wasn't there in the days of Jesus. We wasn't there in the days of Bible. Now they want to for for them now the the modern thinkers now they call modern thinkers critical thinkers they they criticize everything they want to question everything they want an explanation for everything. Now the thing of God must be believed by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But what makes you believe it? It's something on the inside. Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; there must be a represent rep representation on the inside &gt;&gt; to amen that word. Something on the inside must amen that word. &gt;&gt; Something on the inside must agree with it. &gt;&gt; Something that you was always part of. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's coded in your DNA. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you find that those that come into this world, those that cannot believe what we believe, those that want to leave is because they're leaning on wisdom. M &gt;&gt; but faith anchors in revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not reasoning. Because why? It's a supernatural message for a supernatural people. &gt;&gt; A mighty angel descended with an open book. Amen. We had God's visitation in our day. &gt;&gt; And not only was it a once visitation, God is ever present amongst us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now manifesting through us. Because why? It's coming now to a needle point. &gt;&gt; And in the needle point, you see, you can hide things in seed form. You plant something on the ground, you can hide things in seed form, but what you can't hide is something in the harvest time. &gt;&gt; When it has to bear for fruit, whatever seed was in the ground must bring forth of its kind. &gt;&gt; That's right. So whatever seed was planted in the ground must bring the fruit of whatever seed it was. &gt;&gt; Now you can't hide the fruit in fruit bearing time. Whatever fruit was there must show forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It must show what it is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It could have been all the years. It could have had good fellowship all years. But in fruit form now you begin to see. Amen. So this is the needle point time where there will be a great falling away of those that are not part of &gt;&gt; God's program. &gt;&gt; Those that are not part of the body of Christ because we are interested in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are ambassadors of a kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are representing a kingdom upon the earth. &gt;&gt; A kingdom not made with hands. &gt;&gt; A supernatural kingdom. an eternal kingdom and we're part of that body of Christ, the mystical body of Christ and those that are not part of the body will fall out &gt;&gt; that those that don't have a part to play in the body will fall out. Amen. But those that are part of the body must be connected to the head &gt;&gt; must be in oneness with the head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why you are now have his mind. You have his understanding of the word and you know what he once done with the word. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that was a spo that was spoken of us in this hour. Amen. Which is that one? That one with the rainbow of his head, the mighty angel. Amen. Come down to us a people. Amen. So what they trying to do with wisdom now? They're trying to what does critics will do? They will dissect every quotation. They will dissect scriptures by what? Science and history. And they will present their arguments. But their arguments are so weak because they don't tie up with scripture. They cannot take you from Genesis all the way to Revelation. They think they have understanding by criticizing scripture and making weak arguments. But to present your arguments, you must have proper authority. And you cannot go present an argument by hearsay evidence. &gt;&gt; If you was not present present at a particular event, &gt;&gt; you cannot be a witness to that to that event. &gt;&gt; But if if I come and tell you of that event and I was there, what I've already what what I told you and what you are now presenting is hearsay evidence. Is it not? There's no authority behind it. But if you was present there, then that's a different situation. if you witness it yourself. But that's what people are trying to do. Make weak arguments because why? They want to create doubt. That's what happened in the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; We are dealing with spirits. &gt;&gt; Speirs [Music] don't die. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan came to Eve in the Garden of Eden. Eve was presenting the word, &gt;&gt; what she knew of the word, and she gave the exact word. But he just created a doubt. He just changed it. Not He just changed it to one part of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Eve should have said, "But you was not there. Adam was there when God gave the command. &gt;&gt; I was there." &gt;&gt; You know, Adam was Adam told me this, but you was not there. &gt;&gt; That should have been an argument. &gt;&gt; But she took doubt. She took reasoning. Amen. And you find this intellectual people you know when I was studying in university and I thought you know I want to be a good scholar and I will study this theory so nicely I'll study this statutory law and all so nicely and I will try and achieve distinctions and all that was very well but when I started practicing I realized all this theory and all is like nothing like I knew nothing because in reality When you practice something, it's totally different. &gt;&gt; It's like another world out there. &gt;&gt; A lot of people want to give you intellectual concept and bring theology in this message. They studied this message so well &gt;&gt; in theology. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But ask them to go out there, pray for the sick. Ask them now to go and manifest this word, become a manifestation of this word. &gt;&gt; They cannot practice it. &gt;&gt; Because why? There's something else have to kick in. It's either you're in it. It's either you are four in four, you're cut out for it or you're not cut out for it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So theory and practice are totally different things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we're not believing a message on theory. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are believing a message that becomes practical to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; In every aspect of our life, this message is a living words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of lays locked up in his words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. But so why we we we ask ourself but why are people leaving the supernatural message? &gt;&gt; Sure &gt;&gt; because it's suddenly vindicated. &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:9 2:19 says they went out from us but they were not of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For if they had been of us they would not they would no doubt have continued with us. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. But they went out &gt;&gt; that they might be manifest that they would not they were not all of us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; They were amongst us when the word was coming down. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the word was being poured out, when the food was falling out. Amen. But they could not mix the word with faith. Amen. But yay have an uncction from the holy one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know all things. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A separating time &gt;&gt; is to God is doing the separation. Those that were predestinated will remain. Amen. And those who are not predestinated as part of the body will have to fall away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing to do with us. Amen. It is divine choosing. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we find that when the prophet say the shak to pull away &gt;&gt; for the wheat to be seed. &gt;&gt; Yes. for for now for this bride now for this body of Christ to rise up displaying Christ upon the earth everything that is not of Christ must be pulled away. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that is not completely in him that is not part of him that has not come to a complete union with him that has not received the message. What is the mighty angel coming down for? That is the message. &gt;&gt; It's coming down with a message. &gt;&gt; You have not received the shouts. You have not received a message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You have not come into a union. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you have not received that, that is why they are being pulled away because there must be a display. Why does the shark have to be pulled away? For the wheat to be seen. So they have to be pulled away. So Christ must be seen again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There must be an end sign in his end time. Amen. Every son and daughter of God who was in his thoughts before the foundation of the world, if you were predestinated, there's nothing can take you away. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're not, you will eventually go. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You might stay along. You might help along, paying tithe, being a church member, being a part of a people that will be part of the flock. But if you're not, you're going to eventually go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the tightening time. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a tightening time. The true seed of God cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she's anchored in revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She gets stimulated by the word. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Every time she receives revelation, it stimulates her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It revives her. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because you are eating from an open book. You're eating fresh mana all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. This manner cannot be stilled because this man is in the shikina glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not just in the hard courts now. You are not just there in the wilderness receiving manner. &gt;&gt; You are in the most holy place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are now receiving in a private place. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a private affair. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is an intimate relationship between you and Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you are partaking from the from the manner that cannot be still. Oh yes, &gt;&gt; it's packed with good. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's got as you partake of it, it's a supernatural word. &gt;&gt; Oh, this people body one of these days is going to change &gt;&gt; from corruption to incorruption. Amen. &gt;&gt; This mortal must put on immortality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll be able to change dimensions, leap over walls. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There'll be a time when you'll be able to leap over walls. &gt;&gt; That is changing dimensions. Amen. Oh, what a time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we anchored in revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know we're living in an hour where wisdom stumbles. It must stumble. Man-made wisdom must stumble, but faith will always prevail. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Read some quotes. The prophet of God says the message wisdom versus faith. says but there's only two sources that we can draw our life from and one of them is wisdom and the other is faith and if we think that wisdom produces and then what faith produces there is a wisdom of God is stay with his word but Satan in his wisdom try to twist the word so that's the wisdom I'm speaking of there a certain amount of faith that goes with Satan. In order to accept Satan, you got to believe Satan. &gt;&gt; So there is a perverted faith to a perverted thing. And anything that would try to twist the word of God to make it say something that it doesn't &gt;&gt; is the wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Offering wisdom against God's word. So we're going to refer to it as wisdom and not Satan's faith. Many of those people that believe that are sincere and believe just with all the faith that they got that they're right. You have to watch. The blanket stretches two ways down. The only way to be sure is come back to the original word. There is where everything is based on the word. Now we find that these two factions or sources is one wisdom and the other one faith and they verse one another since creation in the garden of Eden. Now there is children on both sides the wisdom we're talking about something that will not agree that all the word is the truth. Some will say you know those things are only for the prophet's time. These things like how the Baptist used to say the Holy Ghost stopped with the apostles. Mark 16 is not for our time. All scripture is given for inspiration. Amen. We take all of the word. Amen. And if wisdom of that sort come from Satan, his children live by that wisdom. And if the faith of God come to God and God is word, God children live on faith. The Bible said they just live by wisdom. Faith they just live sorry they just live by faith. Not what he can learn but what he can believe. Something that's revealed to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now what is the wisdom that we're talking about? Something that will not Sorry. It says now in the 10th chapter of the book of revelation of Jesus Christ I wish to read the first few verse 1-7. He said, "I saw another mighty angel, another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roared. And when he cried, seven thunders uttered their voices." And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not." And the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hands to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever created heavens. And the things that the thing that in them are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things therein are that there should be time no longer. But in the days of the voice of the seven angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets. Now the reason why I read the scripture again I'll tell you why it's in the quote and he says and my text if I should call it tonight is this is this the sign of the end sir now this is a year before the actual event takes place now he says and we all know that we are living in a glorious time for the church but a horrible time for the unbeliever and we living in one of the most dangerous times of All all that ever was since the world began begun. No prophet, no apostle never in no time ever lived in such a time as we live now. This is the end. It's written in the skies, written all over the face of the earth. It's written in every newspaper. This is the end. &gt;&gt; If you can read the handwriting, the prophets lived in the time. When the handwriting was on the wall for a nation, but we living when the handwriting is on the wall for for time, &gt;&gt; all nations, earth, everything, time is at the end. So we must search the scriptures to find the hour that we are living. So he says here now always a true prophet of God will go to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Therefore is absolute that it's going to be that way. In the old testaments when the prophet said anything they always some somewhere was a prophet with the word who stayed with the word. He watched God for the vision and if his vision was contrary to the word then his vision was wrong. That's God way of getting his word to his people. So he's preaching it in 1962 is just the sign of the answer but he's going to a scripture that's going to take place according to his vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he sees a vision and he's going to a scripture and in a vision and the scripture now he's thoroughly vindicated the following year and yet people can be stumbled upon that. How do you explain a man with a seventh grade education going to go now into scripture and because he's interpreting his vision through scripture and he's showing you it's this is now remember I told you somebody's presenting a case they must have evidence this is documented evidence &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; it's there in recordings &gt;&gt; he's making the statements a year before &gt;&gt; so it's evident if you were to present as evidence it's authentic evidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's telling you of the event of his vision &gt;&gt; and he's going to describe what the thing that's going to happen. But he's going to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because what he said, what the Bible says, what what did Paul say? Even if the angel from heaven come and preach any other gospel than what I preach, let him be accursed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So it always must go back to the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. And another scripture says, "Let every word, man's word, be a lie, but my word be the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth will pass away, but my word will still remain. You can't add to the word, you can't take out from the word. So being a prophet, a scriptural prophet, it goes to the scripture, &gt;&gt; but it's recorded and witnesses. But now people who wasn't even there want to present a weak argument &gt;&gt; and dispute a mighty angel coming down. And he went that event is just now just fulfilling this. This was already spoken of before it happened. It it God didn't even have to show it, didn't he? And who took the picture? Science took the picture. &gt;&gt; The prophet didn't go take a camera, take a picture, and then show the people. Science took the picture and showed it there. So it's stubbornly vindicated. Evidence is glaring in the face. The reason why the evidence was there because on the day of judgment the scripture, the vision &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; and the evidence is going to be displayed all over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's going to be evidence beyond a reasonable of doubt there. Now what the people are going to do there before the judgment seat, but thank God we wasn't there. But we see it through the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because we are part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We bypassed our word part. Amen. But now we going back to the word. We are driven back to the word. Amen. All of the word. We are driven back to it. We are being influenced by the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not being influenced by wisdom of man. We being influenced by the words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The revealed word for our day. &gt;&gt; We are being influenced by the supernatural word that was given to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we've been influenced by us, we are no longer conforming any longer to the pattern of this world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because another word has been revealed to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; We are now being transformed by the renewing of our minds. &gt;&gt; Because this word is renewing our mind. &gt;&gt; It's showing us where we originally come from. &gt;&gt; It's showing us what our purpose is intended on the earth for. &gt;&gt; It's showing us what our life ought to be like. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. in showing out our finished completed condition. &gt;&gt; That we are sinless, spotless, bright, without blemish. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yes, &gt;&gt; that we are sons and daughters of the most high God coming to perfection in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know that is the purpose behind you coming to perfection. What is the purpose of you coming to perfection? They without us cannot be made perfect. &gt;&gt; Yes. There's people out there in the sixth dimension that that that needs to be emptied out from there. But they're waiting upon us to come to perfection. Amen. &gt;&gt; All nature is groaning and travailing for sons of daughters of God to come into perfection in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says not by power, not by might, but not by the wisdom of Egypt, not by the wisdom of our schools, not by the power of our seminaries, but not by the amount of our organization, not by the power of our scholarly teachings, but by my spirit say God. His wisdom was vanished and it end when he met God in the burning bush there. talking about Moses now. He took off his shoes and humbled himself to humility and forgot all about his wisdom. God bringing deliverance and to train him in wisdom to let him fall to show that you cannot lean upon the arm of your own understanding or anybody else's understanding. Let him fall to show his hand. Can you see it? God's purpose in doing so was to display himself in humility. And he let Moses become the highest until he would be the next Pharaoh. He was a mighty general according to history. He conquered. Moses himself conquered the countries around. And then when he turned to the work of the Lord with all of his talent, God let him take a headlong topple so that he could put him out there on the desert and beat him all that of him. beat all that out of him and then appear to him in humility &gt;&gt; and send him down with a stick in his hand to deliver the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Same with us. God had to take us out of from every system, from every organization, from all the things that we ever believed in. &gt;&gt; Amen. We had to come to humility. We had to face persecution to believe this message &gt;&gt; to believe his word. I mean, you're telling people that you believe a message that God sent you a a prophet with a word and this prophet is now not living upon the earth. &gt;&gt; And you're believing this. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In a time where times are moving. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where things have become modern, everyone is upgrading, but you are believing this oldfashioned gospel from the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Tell them, "Yes, we believe this oldfashioned gospel because the same old fashioned gospel can still do the supernatural." Amen. &gt;&gt; And even more now, because the Bible said, "Greater works than these shall do." Amen. &gt;&gt; What was done in the days of Jesus, what you saw there, what you read about there, greater works than these are expected upon the earth. Because before we leave the earth, there must be a mighty move of God upon the earth. Right now, all over the world, there's a mighty move of God amongst his body. Amen. Right now, people are getting stirred up. People coming to recognize the hour and the the day that they they're living in right now. They're coming to come in the it is the Holy Ghost working to the five ministry that is positionally placing the people &gt;&gt; into their inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't maybe all the years you was told what your inheritance is, but now you are being placed into your inheritance. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you are good enough now to go and enjoy your inheritance to have the benefits of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says there's one named Paul that was a smart man and he said he had to forget everything he knowed in order to know Christ. He said I never come to you with enticing words. The wisdom of men but I come to you in the power of the resurrection of Christ. &gt;&gt; See Paul did not come with fancy words. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He did not come with fancy quotations. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he did not come and show you fancy things but when he spoke you felt the anointing of God through his ministry. That is why when a son and daughter anointed servant of God comes when a son and daughter of God speak when you speak the people are conf the people are now looking at you in amazement they're wondering why are you speaking the supernatural things they're wondering why are you talking like that because they don't hear these things the little nuggets that you're sharing with people through the week your families your friends the people that you come across they never heard things like that &gt;&gt; because it's a time of spiritual famine &gt;&gt; because why you speaking you're speaking with an anointing ing. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll find that people that you find that maybe the life was so wrecked up, they're going to come to you because why? They know that when you speak, the little words that you say will bring conviction upon them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember the time when I first started preaching and I went out preaching in the in the out there to to people that were homeless and I was preaching out there in the streets and I was preaching one day. I was preaching and then I see people crying. I never saw I what I what I was shocked because now I'm just I'm just thinking I'm breaching but I didn't realize what the power of God can do. &gt;&gt; How you can bring conviction to people one guy comes up to me one day said I used to be a doctor and this is how my life ended up in divorce and so forth and my life got ended up in drugs and this is how I ended up in this condition and the man was in tears but your normal speaking can't do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes the power of God to convict somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't need enticing words. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that is in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What will attract people to you? It's the Holy Ghost in you. &gt;&gt; But people want to be a smart alec. They want to be an intellectual. They want to have the right words. They want to have the right eloquence. They want to pronounce their words properly instead of having a personal relationship with God. Having a back of the desert experience. Amen. When you have the back of the desert experience, when you are here, the supernatural must take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lives can be transformed. What is the greater? What is the greatest thing that can take place? When you find that somebody that nobody even considered them that their lives can be transformed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That they can come and believe the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They can come and believe the things that you believe in. Amen. When is the time when we be able to speak to people and people say, "Brother, I need a change in my life." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you told me is true. The hour is late. I need to take me there. I need to be baptized. &gt;&gt; Or brother, I haven't received the Holy Ghost. I need the Holy Ghost. Brother, I need I have been messing around. I've just coming and and and finding myself comfort and safety and security because I believe a message. But I haven't really had a close walk with God. &gt;&gt; I haven't had a personal walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I haven't felt a personal touch from God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you've been disconnected from God. &gt;&gt; Because you thought you got safety and security in the message because you come by wisdom. &gt;&gt; You need to come by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without faith, it is impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So, we know we are part of the mystery of God. Amen. We know we can't be deceived. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because we are part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 10:39 says, "But we are not of them who draw back unto petition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul." &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't draw back to petition. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a serious hour. You're going to find that many people that profess to believe this message. Many people that came with good and profess to be ambassadors of this message should I say are going to be shaken in this hour because why? It is not them that being shak shaking themselves. No, it's the angel of God that's shaking them out and sifting them out because why? Wrong fruit. If they were right, it's only the fruit that started off right. But the seed, if the seed was right, that fruit must remain. Every other fruit that is not of him that they don't bear for Christ must be plucked out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every other fruit that doesn't bear the life of Christ, what is Christ? Christ is the word. &gt;&gt; Believe all of his word. &gt;&gt; Believe the word because now we're not talking about a word of another day. Believe the word that is now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The word that is being ministered unto you now, the present word, fresh manner. Amen. If you are not bearing forth the fruits and being fruitful, they will be plucked out. Amen. Wisdom versus faith. Amen. And you cannot use man-made wisdom to interpret a supernatural message that comes from a supernatural God &gt;&gt; to a supernatural people. Amen. We might be trapped in the pest house, but we supernatural beings trapped in this flesh body. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you're becoming uncomfortable. You're becoming restless in his body because you're a supernatural being. &gt;&gt; You're desiring a better body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you already know what the body is like. Amen. You already tasted of that body. Amen. Because that that is what you're feeding on right now. &gt;&gt; You are feeding on the body word. Amen. &gt;&gt; The unfailing body word of the son of man. And you know what it's like to have a new body. Amen. And you are feeding on this word that's going to translate this body that's going to make you change dimensions. &gt;&gt; That is why when you go to your doctor, your doctor tell you you got this, you got that. You say right doctor that is your reason that is your scientific knowledge your scientific interpretation &gt;&gt; but I know you're talking about spirits &gt;&gt; and I have rightful claims over my body doctor. &gt;&gt; Oh yes &gt;&gt; and I know the mighty conqueror has already conquered death and and the grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. By his stripes we were healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a finished work. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I have rightful claims to go now and claim my healing &gt;&gt; that I have need of. So doctor, according to your science, there's a limit to your knowledge because you're learning from a finite mind &gt;&gt; and your knowledge is limited and knowledge is always being upgraded. What you hear learned 40 years ago or 20 100 years ago was different. Medical science is improving all the time. But I can tell you something that spirits don't die. &gt;&gt; And I now know what I'm dealing with. &gt;&gt; But I know the one that conquered dead Ellen's brave. He's our only imps. He's our only spirits. And now you know what to deal with. The doctor say, "God, I know that's only a name of a spirit. &gt;&gt; Let me now go and rebuke that name. &gt;&gt; Let me now give you eviction orders &gt;&gt; because why? The one who have rightful claims over me is Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He died for me. He purchased me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only he can claim. These are squatters. &gt;&gt; I'm going to remove the squatters now. I'm going to give them eviction notice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to use South African law because South African law is too lenient on squatters. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. The enforcer of the claim is here. The mighty angel is here amongst us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to use God's laws. I'm going to evict you because said whatever you bind on heaven shall be bound on bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. &gt;&gt; Whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you evict that demon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; From your family, from your loved ones, from your friends, whoever they call evict them. But the person whose body that is, &gt;&gt; it is them that must speak. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's why you find sometime prayers go un unanswered. Because the one where the demon is troubling that person, that person must be able to say, "I don't want you say &gt;&gt; I don't want this demon spirit on me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's same like when you're praying for a sinner, that sinner needs to come to repentance. &gt;&gt; That sinner needs to come forward. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you're going to preach them, preach them, bring conviction, but you are forcing them now to be saved. They don't want to be saved. &gt;&gt; They something must happen on the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. So just like when you're dealing with a demon spirit, &gt;&gt; they need to realize I'm a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Christ has rightful claims over me. &gt;&gt; No demon power has claims over me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No squattering demon has claims over my body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I rebuke you, Satan. &gt;&gt; You leave my body in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can take wisdom. &gt;&gt; You can take the doctor's reasoning. You can reason it or you can take faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can trust God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with taking going going to the doctor. Nothing wrong to take medication, but I take it by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Take it knowing that when I take it, Lord, I'm taking this medication. You have allowed signs to come this far. They went into your laboratory and they they were they now realize they can make this medicine. They can help people. But I'm taking by faith knowing that you've already died for my sins. &gt;&gt; It's a finished work. Amen. All things are possible with God. The other day I went and I met I'll show you my my family the picture of a policeman that I prayed for in 2004 or 2005 either that time right now it's 2025 and he was diagnosed with HIV and he was going to die and he went and I I said to him something in me said I want to pray for you &gt;&gt; and then something in in me. I didn't didn't make it to pray for him on that day. Then he got so sick that he went to the farm to die. Then I just went I felt a little despondent because I didn't get the opportunity to go and pray for him. Yet I know I felt the conviction to pray for him. Something in me tugging me to pray for him. So I prayed him. I studied and I prayed for him sincerely. I said, "Lord, all I want you to do is heal him just enough to come to light duties." I never asked the Lord to heal him. I said, "Heal him just enough." I was specific. I said, "Heal him just enough to come to light duties to work so that I can see him and pray for him." About a week later or two weeks later, I see him there coming to work in the office in plain clothes and light, but very like, you know, you can see debt on his face. I said to him, "You are not here by chance. you are here by the but it's a miracle that you are &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; he said you'll never believe I was there in the farm to die and I thought it's light &gt;&gt; I said red come with me now just go I took him to the helipad &gt;&gt; I took him to the helipad I said right I want you to confess all your sins &gt;&gt; confess all your past sins confess everything &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and I said right now we're going to pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and we prayed a prayer of faith &gt;&gt; wasn't a wasn't screaming wasn't honoring just a simple prayer of faith and immediately when I prayed his whole countenance I saw a change within two weeks later he was back in uniform now it's 2025 I met him again and he was still giving the testimony in the south where he's working now in the south south region at his police station I met him there I took a picture with him and he was telling uh the people there how I prayed for him and what happened what God did for him &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; so we serve a miracle working God &gt;&gt; this is a supernatural God who is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; If he heal one person then, he can heal them today.
