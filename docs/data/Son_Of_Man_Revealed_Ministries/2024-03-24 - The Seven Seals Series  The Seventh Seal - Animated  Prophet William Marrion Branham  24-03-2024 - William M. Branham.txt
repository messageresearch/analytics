TRANSCRIPT
========================================
notice now we're going to read in the Bible in the the seventh seal that's found in Revelations the 8th chapter and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour that's all we have one now we're going to notice I remember after the fourth chapter of Revelations the church is gone after the the uh four harsh Riders has went out church has gone see and then they was Satan and his angels was kicked out and then they come to the earth and the battle set in again because Eve broke down the barrier from where she was uh isolated behind the word of God you believe in God's mathematics you don't you you're sure lost in you'll sure get lost in the word if you start putting a four or six or or something besides this the mathematical words running in order you'll sure have in your seen a cow picking grass on top of a tree somewhere you'll you certainly run out because God does not his whole word does run completely in in in mathematics that's perfect the most perfect there's no other literature written like it like it so perfect in MA mathematics now the the eighth chapter only reveals the scene of uh the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed not nothing all the way back from Genesis this seven chapter the seven seal is spoke of from the very beginning in Genesis the seven Jesus Christ in speaking himself told of the end time and when he got told all SE six seals when he got the seven he stopped there it is it's a great thing and nowhere through the church age since in the early Apostolic church has the Protestant church ever had a prophet tell me who it was short never but we are promised in the last day that to return to the church again for the benefit of straightening up all that has been Mis Mis undone left undone for it's predicted here that the seventh Angel's message would finish the mysteries of God am now we've went through it all we see that it's perfectly in harmony with the scripture that's the reason now could you imagine when this person comes on the scene when he does remember if it'll be so humble and things the the churches a miss it a long ways if there be one among you who's spiritual or a prophet I the Lord my thy God will make myself known to him and speak to him in Visions through dreams interpret dreams somebody have a dream a prophet will be able to interpret it and if if he has a vision he speaks it I'll make myself known to him through visions and dreams make myself knowing and if what he says comes to pass then hear that Prophet because I'm with you now we'll turn now to the eth verse of the uh of the first verse I mean of the eth chapter Revelation uh 81 we must remember at this seven seal is the end of time of of all things right the things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption from before the foundational World it every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world it's end of struggling nature it's the end of everything in there is the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it's the end of the Earth it's a it's even the End of Time Time runs out the Bible said so it's the end of the bows and even in the ushering in of the Millennium that's on the seven seal it's just like firing a rocket into the air and that rocket explodes here and it goes up then explodes again it puts out five stars one of those stars explode and blows out five stars from m and then one of them Stars explodes blows out five stars from mid see it fades on out now how is he going to do it that's what we don't know is we don't know notice the breaking of this seal was so great that heaven was hushed by it in silence for the space of a half hour uh is it great what is it it was hushed Heavens it wasn't a thing move for a half hour when this seven sealed mystery in the book of redemption was broke [Music] open think of it but it's broke amen the land breaks it you know what they were OD by it I mean they didn't know there it was they just stopped why what is it I'm going to tell you in my my revelation of and now uh certain as I stand in the platform tonight uh had the Revelation that revealed it's in a three-fold manner send it there when this left me something has come to me and said Don't Fear now I didn't hear no voice like on inside of me spoke I have to just tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit and said Don't Fear this is that third pull I was standing with a a little baby shoe when he told me say make your first pull and when you do the fish will run after the lure said then watch your second pool said because it'll only be small fish he said then the third pool will get it and this three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language but stand right there and look right straight at it and this is the third pole coming up amen that's the reason all heaven was silent amen remember the seventh messenger was the seven Messengers was the noted one to me the seventh angel it seemed more to me than any I see they were standing like this and I was standing here and I was watching those other see one first bunch of little birds feathers all beat down you remember them and they all flew Eastward and the second Bunch were brighter bigger birds look like doves pointed Wings they flew Eastward first pull second pull then the next was angels and I was standing right there and this explosion left and I was looking this way towards the west and they come and just picked me up in there and I went PL out of my knowing and then one of them coming was the one that looks so strange to me was the one on my beat the left where I entered the constellation at but counting from the left to the right it would been the seventh angel coming across now remember the seven Messengers do you remember the Pyramid of White Rock now notice this that now when this taken place Junior was standing in a field that had a had a big pyramid to it like that and there was something wrot on the rocks and I was revealing that to the people is that right Junior about a year before it happened and notice the next thing now I took some kind of have a bar and cut it off and on the inside was White Rock that had nothing wrot on it and at that time I started to the west and I told them all I said don't go out west stay here and look on this till I return went West for the blast returned back to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreted this Unwritten word amen Hallelujah now if that isn't perfectly God Almighty I want you to know what is but I know that it was in seven Thunders uttering themselves right close together just banging seven different times and it unfolded into something else that I seen then when I seen that I looked for the interpretation it flew across there and I couldn't make it out that's exactly right the the hour isn't quite yet far amen what happens is is that those seven Thunders that he heard thunder and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive Thunders rolling out now why let us prove it why it is the secret that no one knows about John was forbidding to write about it even even not a symol about it why this is why there was no active in he activity in heaven it might give away the secret do you see it now amen but here is seven straight Thunders Right In A Row 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven that perfect number then Heavens couldn't write that Heavens can't know about it nothing else because there's nothing to go on it's a relaxing time you is so great till it's kept secret from the Angels now why if Satan should get a hold of it he might do great damage there's one thing he don't know am if they made one move it might give something away so they just shut up quit harping everything stopped uh seven God's perfect number seven just right down the road seven Thunders utter straight together like you're spelling out something notice at that time John started writing he said don't write it Jesus never spoke of it John Couldn't Write it Angels know nothing about it amen what is it it's the thing that Jesus said said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it see he didn't know it himself amen said only God would know it amen now what this great secret is that lays beneath this seal I do not know I don't know it I couldn't make it out I couldn't tell it just what it what it said but I know that it was in seven thunders of UT themselves right close together just banging seven different times but it's moving into that cycle see it's coming up close so the thing for you to do is to remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen Lord hallelujah and here when the seventh seal when he opened it he also omitted it again see so we see that it is a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet for this mystery to be known therefore we're this far and the rest of it will be known right around about the time that Jesus appears on Earth again for his bride or whatever takes place at that time now until that time let's just all pray live good straight Christian lives looking forward for his coming now the Vision Plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision and the Revelation the interpretation thereof is thus sayeth the Lord now may the Lord bless you all each one real richly as we stand now and sing uh this good old song of the church God bless you each one amen
