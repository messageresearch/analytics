TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Brother Sam and Lord others that may be unwell in body we pray Lord that your healing virtue will flow through and Lord we know father there still an atonement for us oh God that we can look to the Cross we can look to the blood we look to you now in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with much Thanksgiving amen amen amen Lord amen God bless you amen I pray that you all well and amen seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah amen thank you brother Tyler I was wondering is happening here amen nice to have some cool breeze amen because the Holy Ghost when he comes he'll bring the fire amen you know it's a that's what John says he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire amen so praise the Lord amen let's turn to our Bibles so we'll be taking communion tonight and due to the water outage we won't be able to do the second part amen so we'll just communion amen praise the Lord Ephesians 1 and: 7 says I'll read from verse six to the praise of the glory of his grace Amen to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace amen so what are the riches of his grace amen we all want to know what is the riches of his grace amen let's turn to Zechariah Chapter 4 amen praise the Lord I encourage you to carry your Bibles amen you shouldn't be coming to church without your sword Hallelujah every Christian ought to be reading the word of God carry your Bibles amen it says here we'll read Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse 6 then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts who are thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen amen so when is double Grace coming down at the time of The Headstone amen praise the Lord moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts had sent me unto you amen for who had despised the day of small all things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hands of zerubabel with those seven these are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated hallelujah amen amen so we as the body of Christ we are living in a very crucial hour amen it's the closing years of our Earthly existence amen so we are to be mindful of that and sometimes it seems like we are living dual lives amen it seems like we are reminded of the Spiritual Beings that we ought to be maybe when we come to church but in the rest of our lives we are so caught up in the carnality of things am amen that sometimes we just get caught up because those are our duties but then we get caugh so caught up in it that sometimes we may even forget what our true purpose on the earth is what we are called for amen and that's what the Lan spirit will do that's right amen now we know that we come to church we especially to the message church because of one thing to prepare us for the Rapture amen how many if you can say Amen to that amen we didn't come here because we want a better house a better car a better this and a better that if you study hard enough you work hard enough the law on the earth is what you sow you're going to reap if you are too lazy and you're not getting what you ought to be getting in this life that's on you because God had put a law on the earth amen as a man Seth that shall he reap amen if you s sparingly you're going to reap sparingly so let's not confuse amen those things with the gospel there's something that stands out about the message of the hour and that is the preparation for the Rapture preparation for a body change and that's what the whole Seven Seals was about to come to give us rapturing Faith amen I think that needs to be said more because sometimes people get caught up in the blessings and the thing I need to go to church because of the blessings amen not realizing that blessings follow you amen because you are the seed of God in this time amen you are like Abraham Abraham never went chasing blessings and you are the Seed of Abraham amen so realize that and you won't be in lack know that you are the Seed of Abraham amen amen and I if you know what that when the Lord is telling Abra here in Genesis he's telling you that the seed of the woman shall bruise the Serpent's head he is talking about a spiritual seed coming so even though there were natural seeds of Abraham like Isaac Jacob and Joseph and all of these seeds they were not what God was talking about amen the seed that was to come that was going to bruise the Serpent's head was our Lord Jesus Christ amen but I'm asking you how did the seed progress because our lord Jesus said I I'm showing you now he said when I go away I'm going to send you another comforter right so the Seed of Abraham how does it end up he ends up by sending his Spirit back to the Earth did Jesus say he's going to send another comforter amen he's going to lead you and guide you into all truth amen that's Bible you can say amen for that amen hallelujah but whose Spirit came back did he did he say I'll send my spirit oh maybe we have trinitarians here maybe you think it's another spirit amen he's sending back his Spirit upon the Earth so what am I telling you that when you have the Holy Spirit that's the seed that's the seed come back in spirit form amen hallelujah so when you become a carrier when you become filled with the Holy Ghost you are Abraham's seed amen so blessings follow you and all of these things follow you amen amen hallelujah but we are more concerned about preparing for a body change because what shall it profit me if I gain the whole world gain houses and lands and cars and money and all of these things and I lose my very own soul what does it profit me if I lose preparation for the Rapture and I don't have faith for a body change now if we don't have the faith for a body change that's on us because the one that was sent to prepare us for a body change give us a message for a body change has come and gone his message has already sounded there's no longer Mysteries to be revealed he sounded all the mysteries of God Amen Hallelujah so you'll find on most times it's laziness on our part that we don't want to get interested in the things of God we don't want to amen go and read the word of God don't want to read the message of the hour wherein lies rapturing Faith amen amen hallelujah so we need to shake ourselves out of that laziness I can't say spiritual laziness because you're not spiritual not you now I'm talking about the person that it relates to right we can't call it spiritual laziness because you're not spiritual amen it's carnality and laziness amen the ones that are spiritual will find Value in the word of God will find Value in the message of the hour amen as time progresses the message doesn't get stale the the voice of the Prophet doesn't get boring to us amen but the voice is a voice that is ordained in the Bible in the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen every time you hear that voice don't shut it down amen it's a voice sent like Mama Eagle to thunder out amen hallelujah amen we can't replace the voice amen we can't replace it with another teaching we can't replace it with another man's idea this voice Came From Heaven amen it's a voice was recorded in heaven amen his birth was aligned with the Stars It Was Written in the first Heaven amen hallelujah and God wrote it in this Bible now we know that the Bible how many of you know in what form the Bible is currently we know this is the word of God Amen but you can leave it laying here in written form but currently if you're really under the revelation of the hour the Bible has moved from off the pages of this book and it's become a living word amen a Living Word in a living people hallelujah because I am the embodiment of all the Bible spoke aboutall amen I am the representation Hallelujah of everything of in the groom form now everything the Bible prophesied when Jesus was standing there on the earth he was the Living Word he came to make every word live amen when it came regarding the law he said I have come to fulfill the law I have come to complete the law amen now everything that was prophesied about him became alive in Jesus Christ how about us in this time and season amen everything the Bible speaks about in end time people becomes alive in you and I amen praise the Lord so we are partakers of this Grace yes amen now we know amen how many if you know just shut it out if you know it the number associated with with Grace what is the number five amen praise the Lord so here the Bible is saying that when we come to the edstone there'll be shoutings of Grace Grace now that's double five and what's double five come on now double five is 10 right when when The Headstone is coming down and what happens in Revelation 10 amen hallelujah great is coming back to a people shouting of Grace is coming back to a people amen so aut it's a year of double Grace amen praise the Lord so that's scriptural prophecy there now amen so we are living right now in The Riches of his grace amen what is Grace God's unmit favor meaning we did nothing to Merit this what God has given us amen hallelujah thank you Lord and therefore it ought to put us in a sacredness to know amen that God's Grace has abounded to us he didn't have to do it but his grace was shed forth in our hearts am amen hallelujah now because he sent forth Grace to us we ought to live reverently soberly in this hour it shouldn't be a case now where when we he communion we try and make things right amen amen hallelujah amen you think I'm good thoughts so what I'll do is this person I got enity I won't think about them I'll shut them out of my mind so I have all good thoughts so when the pastor ask do you have any ought against one another I'm not thinking about that Jes I'm only thinking on you now no amen the Bible says be at peace with all men amen hallelujah he says if you have ought against one another go and make that thing right amen even when it comes to the gifts of the church and all of these things he says before you offer your gift go and make yourself right that's Bible amen hallelujah and that's what a true born again Christian will do the holy spirit will be grieved if you if you know you got something against somebody and then you know the holy spirit is not an hypocrite but the Holy Spirit within you will say why don't you rather forgive why don't you rather love amen so praise the Lord so we're coming now to that time where we are being built up amen being built up into that statue of a perfect man because that's the man that's going in the Rapture yes amen hallelujah and the shoutings of Grace Grace amen his unmar favor Upon Us amen amen a double Grace why at this time is it coming in double portions amen amen it's coming in a double portion to you and I yes I don't know about you but I need a double Grace in this time Hallelujah I need a double Grace in the latest age Amen in the midst of gross darkness that when God threw it up in the skies it was completely blacked out who would say they don't need double Grace in a time like that but yet when the prophet drew it he said I drew a little light in there because I knew that there's going to come forth a bride amen amen a people will shine for their light amen the Bible says arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen up upon you how many if you can see the glory of God in your life amen how many if you can see the grace of God in your life hallelujah amen we ought to be testifying to the grace of God on our lives thank you brother Sam amen because he walks with us he talks with us amen hallelujah in the time when Satan is bringing condemnation and he's bringing fear and he's bringing amen trying to tell you that you are not worth it you are not worthy amen you say Lord your grace is sufficient for me Lord your grace is sufficient for me hallelujah amen because it's not what I have done I didn't go and redeem myself am I couldn't redeem myself but the blood of Jesus that's what Ephesians 1 year is telling us in whom we have Redemption through his blood amen amen the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace so we don't have forgiveness of sins from an Earthly judge so the forgiveness is not conditional the Forgiveness he takes your sins and he puts it in the sea of forgetfulness amen amen people think oh I've done such a great thing such a bad thing such a this and that I want to put a scripture in your mind and the Bible says that all manner of sin will be forgiven except if you blaspheme the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen if you blaspheme the Holy Ghost so I ask you what sin are you talking about what sin doesn't the blood take care of yes what sin have you committed in your life have you done in your life that the blood doesn't cover name it I'll give you a minute nobody the blood of Jesus covers all sin so when we are talking about redemption in which says here in whom we have Redemption through his blood I want you to get it in your mind that Redemption is not just relating to salvation salvation is just a part of it but the real revelation of redemption is I am going back to my original being amen the general gospel being preached is that Jesus Christ came to offer a Salvation he came to save us from our sins amen part truth part truth but Redemption means that you go back all the way back to what you fell from Hallelujah people don't like that yeah people want God to do everything amen hallelujah it's it's in the nature of man Fallen man to go and bow down to an image and to an idol yes they're wanting some Supernatural assistance but God has you you know what Supernatural assistance is coming from where from a man who recognizes his position yes from a man who's filled with the holy ghost from a man who is groaning the Bible says groaning within themselves waiting for the adoption of children amen hallelujah you can keep coming to the good old priest and saying bless me bless me bless me amen that is traditional but when you start to recognize who you are Hallelujah am you know the prophet was in discernment many of times yes and he would call people by the names and he would call this names addresses there was one time that he was not aware of name address where he was what was happening in fact the person that was operating the gift knew him was waiting at the gate for him some of you look confused the woman who stopped the plane Anda the prophet didn't see a vision didn't even know about her he thought the plane grounded because of whatever reason and the Lord told him walk Hallelujah but the woman standing at the gate knew him she was able to recognize Elijah she said I am the shunamite woman amen amen than you Lord where is your Elijah now how many of us if we speak a word like that can wait at the gate to see the Promise come to pass she spoke the word but she waited there am what happened if she had gone to just a normal chores I'm asking you what caliber of woman was this that was able to speak the word and wait at the gate to see it fulfilled when you speak a word do you walk away or do you wait that to see it fulfilled she waited at the gate we don't know how many hours because God let to ground the plane tell his Prophet to walk amen hallelujah his Prophet is walking and as he's walking walking by he sees this woman standing there and she says good morning Pastor hallelujah what faith is able to operate that amen when Jesus is talking about great faith like the centurion's faith I want you to see something here now Jesus is the Living Word yes Jesus is the word made flesh John 1 in the beginning was the word everybody agreed yes there was no one more powerful than Jesus how many of you agree Jesus is telling the Centurion I'm going to come to your house this man understanding The Authority you remember the last time I was telling you you all the legal authority Jesus The Living Word told him I'll come to your house who changed it who dares speak to the Living Word and change him and say no I am a man of authority I say to one go and he goes amen he changed Jesus words and he said you speak the word and my servant will be healed you carry a power within you you carry a legal Authority within you amen now think about it would you have told Jesus that but Jesus said I've never seen such a great faith able to speak to the Living Word and change what he said what measure of faith is that amen amen hallelujah but we are coming now to a greater dimension of Faith yes as we are understanding ourselves and as we are understanding what we are called for in this time and season we are coming to a greater level of Faith do you know why how many if you know why you're coming to a greater level of Faith because you are not a man of faith alone you are not a woman of faith alone amen you say tell me what you're talking about you're a man with added virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness motherly kindness you're a man who doesn't just possess faith alone if you go and read that message it tells you it's not your own virtue it's Holy Ghost virtue it's holy ghost power every one of those steps is not something you add to it but it's the Holy Ghost adding it to you that's right thank you Lord these are not human attributes yes this is Holy Ghost attributes because the Holy Ghost is your original spirit yes that man fell from when God made man in his own image that's the spirit he created a perfect Spirit a Godlike spirit so he sent the original Spirit back to the Earth and then he says he changed your spirit to get on with the holy spirit because in your normal Fallen Spirit you'll reject the holy spirit so he had to give you a new nature he had to give you a new spirit amen so that you can make room for the Holy Spirit somebody give God praise amen amen hallelujah we haven't come in this time and season to preach a Wishy wasy gospel we've got to preach the revelation of the hour we've got to preach the Holy Ghost in its fullness amen this is not the Holy Ghost birthing justification sanctification baptism of the gifts amen hallelujah this is the Holy Ghost come to birth Sons and Daughters of God to life in this time and season come to make you know as you were known in the back part of God's mind so that makes you Supernatural that doesn't takes you out of a message church and places you in your position amen amen don't be satisfied sitting in a messy Church coming to Heavenly places in Christ that's our position amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord it might sound hard for you amen maybe thinking what am I talking about I just want to go to a church and say to believe in a prophet amen you were called for more than that amen you are called for the fullness of the hour you are called for the fullness of the word amen hallelujah the prophet swed like he says there in the church ases he swed amen from Genesis to Revelation and how if you know everything that you sow must bring forth fruit he s the doctrines of the Bible amen hallelujah but now comes our's time everything that he sold amen every word that is spoken concerning this bride every word that he said about her prophesied about her coming to manifestation I'm so excited at this time I'm so amen this is the best age to be living in amen that's not just a slogan we say but I feel it in my soul amen it's the best time and season to be living in somebody give God praise if you believe it this is not Luther's age this is not Wesley's age this is not the age of the isza street outpouring amen this is not the early move of the Holy Ghost Amen in the first and second pole amen hallelujah amen because all that could produce amen hallelujah was just a little bit efficient amen but this is a move Amen to get those predestinated seeds that were in the earth Hallelujah you know the prophet talks about how in a you can lay something even under concrete like grass or whatever it says if you find Sunlight strike them it comes forth through the concrete breaks through you'll find cracks and everything coming through in a dark doomed lateran Age full of Blackness Darkness covers the face of the deep amen there are seed jees planted in this time at the end of that seventh age he planted Jean seeds amen hallelujah amen and the Word was preached amen Malachi four came with a message amen hallelujah and he was sewing the seed amen all the way from serpent seed Amen to the L rain he sow those seeds amen hallelujah and when those seeds were being swn amen what was he doing he was laying what what is the word water you washed by the watering of the word so he was watering the ground watering the ground watering the ground amen knowing that somewhere in leosia in the Blackness of leosia there SE Gene in there so he started to water the Earth seven times he went watering and watering amen sewing amen watering the Earth with the word with the word with the word but there came a Time amen at the rising of the sun amen when the sunlight must shine again amen when the sun shines amen your C Gene had to Quicken and break through latery and Blackness break through latery and darkness amen you burst forth in a light time of life thank you Lord call for a time and season as this amen you're a special class of people you're a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation God calls you a king and a priest amen amen as soon as the book is taken and and amen he he takes the book he says the song goes forth for thou has made as Kings and Priests unto our god oh we are such a special class of people if we can only recognize it amen look past your problems look past your trials look past your circumstance see what the word of God says about you amen hallelujah know that greater is he that is within me than he that is in the world Amen Hallelujah I am more than a conqueror through Christ amen hallelujah amen we may seem like a a simple class of people amen we may seem like amen we're not better than most people educated people and think like that amen but God doesn't look like that God doesn't choose that way look at how he chose David he took him from sheep hering don't let anyone devalue you you're a son and you're a daughter of God and don't devalue Yourself by speaking negative that you're good for nothing that nobody loves you nobody cares about you you are speaking against the word of God amen the Bible says God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life thank you Lord amen God sent forth his son because he loved youen amen so know who we are in this time and season amen hallelujah you have the riches of his grace Hallelujah you carry the riches of his grace for you to wake up every morning for you to be a part of what God is doing in this time it's the riches of his grace we didn't deserve it this is double Grace come to us Elisha said a double portion of your spirit amen he's he's given us a double portion but now we receive a double portion of Grace to walk in the light to walk in the light amen hallelujah we are not looking for light to come from Heaven the light is on the earth within us the only light people will see is you and I so speak your words Speak Life to them find a way to Speak Life to them tell them about Jesus tell them about amen what God's doing in the end time you know I was talking to one of the salesman at work and he's a not a Christian is a Hindu amen and he was telling me you believe in reincarnation so I to a very interesting subject you going into now I said no I don't believe in reincarnation I said because then I started to take him through life animal life plant life and I said what's the highest form of life and you could see what I was getting he says man I said yes man is the the highest form of life man can think man can create man what what is it about man why is man so unique from the Animal Kingdom and I said why would you want to come back in a lower form I said if God is going to do anything he'll bring you back in a better form in a better condition he said what do you mean then when he said what do you mean it opened up a way for me for me to sh original man amen how Man was created how he's a God man this man is like he never heard this before denominations don't know about a God man a man who could speak to winds man who could speak to the waves I said this is what happened then I told him what happened in the Garden of Eden and how man fell he said it's impossible for us to go back I said no it's not impossible that is why Jesus Christ came you see when I presented the gospel this way he didn't because generally the gospel is presented in he Jesus Christ came to save us for our sin do you know you're a sinner you know you're a sinner that guy is thinking I'm not a sinner why you talking about Sin you know sin only becomes sin when you know the truth just like how the children of Israel prior to them having the law they didn't know what they're doing was wrong but when God gave the law then it became wrong so sin only becomes sin when you know the truth so I didn't present it to him that Jesus Christ came to save you from your sins I told him Jesus Christ to came to redeem us back to our original condition and you could see he never heard the gospel in this way before cuz he from his mouth said it's hour we're going to go back and that's when I presented Jesus to him I said Jesus came to take us back to that condition and I said when I die I'm going into a better body I'm going into a better State not never to die I said man was not created to die so you talking about dying and coming back in another form man was never created to die we've got to preach the gospel of redemption that's the gospel of the Kingdom because man fell from the kingdom in Eden man must be restored back to the kingdom that's what the three-fold purpose is to restore the kingdom thank you let's not lose sight of that amen that's just a little word of encouragement let's give the Lord a good an clap of Praise amen he's worthy of praise double Grace amen double Grace come upon US carriers of Grace if people want to see personification of Grace they must look at us now I want to leave you with a thought if God if no matter what we did God gave us double Grace how can we not be gracious to others how can we not extend Grace to others amen we are carries of Grace the only love the only Grace people will see through you and I amen so let's just not amen always offer up harsh words but always Grace as much as I receive I give out amen I receive Grace I'm pushing out in multiplication amen that's the gospel of the Kingdom amen hallelujah it is better to give than to receive Hallelujah let's all stand together as we read a portion of scripture amen we go into the communion if we can get the communion wine and the bread Hallelujah 1 Corinthians chapter 11 praise the Lord so the Bible reads from verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me so part of why we do the communion take the body the bread represents the body we remembering our Lord we are remembering our Messiah amen our Lord Jesus Christ after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had slept saying this cup is the New Testament New Testament means New Covenant in my blood this do he as of as he drink it in remembrance of me for as of often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come now that coming is not talking about a spiritual coming he says tell till he come there are some people who have stopped taking communion because they believe that the Lord came we know he came in the word coming amen but Jesus he says what did he say for as often as you eat so this is the Apostle Paul speaking this if you go and read Jesus speaking he says I will take it and you with you in my kingdom I'm going to take take it with you again in my kingdom when is that at the completion of the second coming when we go to the married supper of the Lamb amen hallelujah so we want to see a physical Lord Jesus amen we want to see a physical Lord Jesus how many of you can say Amen to that amen because Jesus Christ has a glorified body and when we see him we shall be like him we shall be glorified like him amen hallelujah so we are doing this in remembrance of him amen praise the Lord I just want to say
