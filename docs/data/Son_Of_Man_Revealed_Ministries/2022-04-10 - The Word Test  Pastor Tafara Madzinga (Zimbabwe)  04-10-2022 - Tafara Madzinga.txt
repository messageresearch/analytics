all in the only hands father as I commit my body yes yes as we ask for it and pray in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen we are still standing uh we may open our Bibles to the Book of Genesis chapter 24. amen praise the Lord amen thank you Genesis chapter 24. 58. amen Genesis 24 h the Bible says and they called Rebecca and said unto her will to thou gold this man and she saved I will walk amen hallelujah amen amen you may be seated amen amen um I would like to take this opportunity to express my unborn gratitude and acceptance of the responsibility to be standing behind this second desk and honor and respect my precious brother Pastor uh and accept the fellowship and the presence of pastors that are with us in the weathering amen and I trust that the Lord is going to be merciful amen amen trust that we are all happy to being the president of the Lord amen amen we trust that we are all happy to be in his kingdom yes amen and that we are candidates of problem of God as he plays out this program yes drama amen um I'd like to speak on a little subjects that I've given the title the word test amen amen amen glory the word amen amen praise before I go any further I'd like to kind of uh go backwards uh of scriptures on this chapter chapter 24 I'd like to take you backwards a little bit I'm gonna just be referring to this chapter from its beginning and I would like to take your attention to verse 4 where Abraham is giving instructions to his servant Eleazar amen this is a familiar story to us as Believers and yes Bible students amen and uh these are some of the Bible stories that must kind of reminders and kind of wake us up in this hour as we see the types and shadows of what what is he expecting us to be in as a condition and uh as the bride of Christ now Abraham is uh sending his uh uh servant who is a laser to get a wife for his child or his boy Isaac yes but my interest on best for is the fact that Abraham is actually giving Specific Instructions foreign to make sure that there is no room for human Airlines to the program of his kingdom so the most important thing that is to say you must get a wife or my son from my Kindle yes this is something that Abraham was very particular about yes amen he wanted to make sure that elieza would understand that kind of woman that was supposed to be the wife for his son amen because remember there is a bloodline to be protected amen remember that um whatever comes out of that Union is going to have something to do in the future amen and about his kingdom and if you have something to do with what God had promised him of what was going to happen to his seed yes amen so he tells us this seven that um you must not take a woman from any other places yes besides my own country then he says uh you must take from my own Kindred yes I mean let me read that verse before I proceed amen he says uh on verse 4 but Thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac now the the way the kindred means family or relative amen so Abraham wounded uh Eliza to get a wife from his own family okay from his own relatives yes right so we find out that uh because of that Rebecca was actually a relative devising yes amen Rebecca belonged to the same family with Isaac yes Isaac had the ones being together yes somehow amenities it means some sometimes they were found together in the genes of somebody amen amen because what happened to the family then you begin to have family tree but one time there is a gene that is in somebody so the great one of the great great grandfathers of Isaac you know what happened in the family what I'm talking about amen you you you have your son inside of you yes and that sun is good Sons yes inside of him and they will have they also you have your grand grand children within you yes amen so at one time Rebecca and Isaac were together in somebody yes in one of the their great great grandfather they were together but because of the family progression and the family tree growing they ended up you know going different directions amen and then Abraham of course were now far away from his country of origin and so forth but Abraham understood all this Dynamics amen and he says uh you go and you get your wife but make sure you get off my own kindred I was supposed to go and get a woman for Isaac from the very family of Abraham amen so uh there comes now the issue later this kind of relationship between Isaac and um and the baker obvious it had something to do with how things were going to happen yes in this commission for foreign that's why now you you see when elieza asked before water from Rebecca the most important part or portion of the of the of the reaction or the actions of Rebecca was not the watering of areas no but the watering of the camels amen was the important part of the manifestation of Rebecca amen amen and yes there was not much concerned about how many liters he was going to get no but the the watering of the camels was what was very important in the mystery of the calling out of this Brian I mean now it's important for us to remember that uh Rebecca's actions we're actually going to determine whether eleazar's Ministry had been successful or not amen actually asked God for a fleece yes okay because he wanted to be very sure and brahmanam says if you are sincere about it God will reveal it amen so aliens are knowing how God works and how important it was to get the right person for Isaac here to pray first so he said the The damself Who after I say give me water the one that is going to give me water and then you water the colors then I know that's the one what's the language yes he says the one that you have what you have prepared he has commanded amen you have prepared already that's the evidence that she is the one yes so the mystery of who the bride or the wife of Isaac was was actually sued yes within that that portion of that person amen yes so when when Rebecca came to the world and uh elieza said to Rebecca give me water [Music] was in two portions amen the open part of that which was the the part which said give me water yes and it does sealed the bat which was the water he was that come here yes so the mystery of the manifestation of the bride was actually in the sealed part of that foreign it was not open in other words it was that's going to be a security part of that portion of the world to protect that information from the wrong thing yes from the wrong candidates so that it's a it's a it's a pin code to stop those who are not ordained you stay away amen amen to make sure that you know Jesus Christ saying them to Peter Upon This Rock will I build my church and God is very good at that at managing his information Amen to make sure that is not accessible everybody and the Rebecca was not there but soon after that Rebecca shows up amen so now Rebecca comes in Arabica I mean speaks their weight the spoken word and says give me water and he stops now why did the Rebecca water the condos now the other thing which is important in this that the camels did not belong to aliens yes the Canyons actually belonged to Abraham Allah brought earlier that the messenger to Rebecca then the camels were actually the the force or the the the the the power going to take Rebecca back to Abraham to Isaac amen so there was some some connections some relationship there was a deep that was in in Rebecca that was responding Amen to that to the still the part of his commission Hallelujah there was there was a mystery something was happening which was not he was only revealed to Rebecca amen environment so Rebecca's actions proved actually that she was the bride amen amen so it was actually a mystery which was not revealed to everyone else only Rebecca had the revelation of what Elias are one day done by that spoken word which is saying give me water yeah amen amen and it was revealed to her by the Holy Ghost amen amen hallelujah now Rebecca was being tested by the word amen amen amen now in this hour now where the bride is supposed to be taken up God is testing the bride by the way he is waiting and testing to see who's going to respond who is going to do what okay God help us now she was tested by the word to see how she was going to react yes what she was going to do about the word that is okay the spoken word amen but it was in two parts that sealed in the open part of it I mean but now remember that Prophet also says the word is in the bride amen and the mind of Christ to know what God wants done with that way amen because in this hour is not everybody that is going to know what to do with us okay has been given but not everyone is going to know what to do with us yes and the Mystery of the bride of Christ that portion of the way which is that child is filled yes it's not all of them that are going to be listening to the text who are going to know what to do with that but the bride of Christ because she cannot be deceived yes the word the prophets is actually in the bride in the mind of Christ to know what good was done with that spoken and that was what was happening with the Rebecca the word was in heaven yes so the other portion of the word which was actually sealed it was inside of her and it was revealed here by the Holy Ghost not you are told the Holy Ghost told her that when you hear aliens are saying give me water he actually says give me water in the camera then she did exactly that thank you and she met the expectation of the hour and that was what Elias that was looking for that was what it is I was expecting he was watching out for not who was going to give him 20 liters of water or whatever but the person who was going to respond to the covenants someone who's going to know one to the need that in the camera was what was going to prove who was the bride yes amen hallelujah now remember brother Branham tells us about her the story the story of the eagle amen now there's something that I'm interested in that story which makes me uh feel very good about it now the prophet tells us that um the ego laid in hell amen amen and when she laid an egg somehow this egg ended up in the band yeah amen by the farmer's place amen but it was not the choice of the egg amen amen to be found amongst the eggs of the chicken amen it found itself in there amen amen now the eagle noise oh yes When She lays the egg she knows God is not an oath of confusion he will never lose any one of his own he does not forget amen no matter how far you can go [Applause] someone somehow someday somehow all the way up because he knows his own he knows your name he knows where you stay he knows where you're coming from he knows where you're supposed to be he knows your position in Christ he knows when to bring you back he knows he knows how to work with you [Applause] are you going to get lost amen thank you now when time came because the ego knows by now the evil didn't do for the egg when it was not yet but there is a process started looking for something it was now out of the shape then you must begin to describe now the eaglet is the capacity to hear yes that's all the mother wanted she was hearing a lot of things but now the mother comes and now the eaglet is amongst the the chickens in the Banyan okay and she had been mistaken and been taken into things and but some of urbanization that the English knew that there must be something wrong about where I am yes there must be something I may not be explained but I'm not satisfied I mean that is why even in this hour no make how much come for that the people may be somebody somewhere going to hunger with [Applause] somebody [Applause] yes Hallelujah and good knows that oh thank you and when she came the prophet says she let out the scream spreading it amen he was demonstrating what he is she was showing the eaglet down there yes what is possible amen amen amen have been taught by mother chicken that there's no flying that happens yes yes here we just believe it as it is we don't do more we we don't fly higher yes anything that flies above be careful amen amen when he was taught never to look up yes yeah just look down here yes you must be satisfied with what we are doing but when there's something when this is [Applause] amen that's why he promised [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what was happening she though she had that for the first time yeah that's that's the mystery it was for the first time yes that screen yes yes but it was nothing and sit inside [Applause] how come she hears this kind of scream for the first time and she she likes it why amen amen he says every sound is a meaning yes and now because this eaglet also has the same sound in her but she had never practiced because mother chicken could not cry like that yeah so how could she teach her yeah she was not an ego but not because she was born in the ego yeah amen yes almost the characteristics were in that English but he didn't know yes because the environment he was brought up with was not conducive for the manifestation of the power of God [Applause] but God did not stop what he took for the mother ego to come around yes and make a second sound yeah and that sound was actually inside that's what I wanted [Applause] it [Applause] was the chickens the chickens were trying to discourage it yeah where do you want to go you have been here all this yeah yeah oh Hallelujah [Music] take a look you are now getting into foreign [Applause] something inside of me tells me man there's something more to this there's something more about worshiping God there's something more about coming to church there is something more that is [Applause] she was giving away the taste amen the ego gave the eaglet the word you say now this is what we do this is what we believe in what do you say about it yeah you can say Amen yes thank you and when she said she began to flip it yes she began to recognize yes she began to recognize his name yes now when the Bible says recognizing your day yes yes and its message it's not a day that you are talking about on the current yes yes amen no yeah it's the day of the Lord amen but now remember that that day that you are talking about the Bible is saying your day so it's not a day of a calendar but it's the season of your manifestation amen amen so you recognize the English recognized the season to fly yes it recognize that day which it was supposed to be manifested Amen Let me live in this profession amen your reaction to God cherries whether you were there or not amen yes absolutely the prophet says something here in the spoken word uh that was spoken word is the Original Seed paragraph 330. when I'm saying something he says give it the word taste that's the way to tell whether it's right or wrong just give it in the world just see what it says about the world any spirit see what it says if it denies the wind amen is not of God no matter what it is if it denies the word this note of God look give it the way the taste it and see what happens amen now when the prophet talks about denying the way it's not about saying no the spoken word is wrong yes or the Bible is wrong no but this is actually religious people that's right so-called Believers yeah just like the Pharisees and the suggestions they denied the wind amen Jesus but the the word in black and white they called themselves the Believers of the message Freedom they were reading it they were listening to the depths of Moses but when the word which they were reading yes became flesh that we need to confuse the names yes people praise God for what is done amen yes in the past amen and then clap your hands of what is coming yes but when we come to what he's doing now [Music] yes yeah anyone can claim to believe yes because he's not there yeah yeah but when he was walking down there there were people who were more religious than you before he didn't understand you see when they were reading the scripture yes imagine shall conceive and they go and preach it Hallelujah why is the Virgin had to conceived amen amen amen yes they continue teaching their people and preaching to the people that change that the Messiah is coming when the Messiah was preaching next door what was happening yes when they look at Jesus they said yeah amen and then it takes Amendment all right to recognize who Jesus was no because the the prophet says a true demon recognizes the presence of God because the Bible says Ephesians 6 12 we restored against flesh so spiritual things are spiritually designed amen because he was the word made the flesh and the prophet says we bypass our children and he came into this body all the time but in Jesus when he came from God he went straight to his family before he came into faith so when he was the sum total of God there was both that she off and healed the flesh amen amen and when demons looked at him they were not looking at the flesh with the Pharisees were looking at them that demons were saying that Jesus yeah it was the word which had come to the flesh yes and the Pharisees were looking at the flesh but he failing to see the word amen amen thank you the prophecies uh in the message the invisible Union of the blood of Christ now here the prophet says if it denies the way it's not the word so you see the Pharisees when they denied the word they were not denying the word in black and white yes but no it's because like I'm saying when the world becomes the flesh when it's present that way to confuse his people because people confuse when they hear about the word of God they don't know what the word of God is and they think the word of God is the Bible yeah but now that the Bible starts with the beginning when the creation was do it was happening amen that's where it starts in the beginning it was without form that's what the word refers to to the people yeah then comes he says we don't start here yes he says you and me come come let us go to the banister of time and watch things is being happy yes and many inflation yes taking the church the believer the bright sake forget about goodness is one before we amen [Applause] yes and he talks about the ethic coming out as a child and then it runs away and then he stops stops it brings back and then he says it begins to melt that the Isis and everything else and then he says when the water melted then we had Genesis one Hallelujah and John 1 says in the beginning was the weight yeah the word was with God Amen and the wind was good amen which was in the beginning before it was written because this was written by Moses so he's talking about the word which it was in the beginning which was with God before it was in black and white amen because the black and white is a portion of the sun total of the word of God Amen this is not happening that is written here even the Bible in the New Testament says the works of Jesus is not all that was amen somewhere left out it has to be a book but the other portion amen is lift up because that is the portion that is reserved for the bride for the direct it's actually the blind let me read this invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 241. will you help me he says tip number six five one one two five paragraph two four one this is it was put in there by predestination amen amen you we are full ordained to a son of God you were in God before the foundation of the world you are only manifested in this day for his honor Amen in glory yes how can you do it without honoring his word amen understand with every word of God Amen yes which you are a part of that word amen by predestination because look the God is the word amen you believe it well then he always was the winter in the beginning was the week and if the weight was good then you were in God the path that you are to play was in God before the foundation amen he's in you he knew you he previously for me to expand on this let me read that the last quotation so that we some in what we want to say here the message is identify the Christ of all ages watch that I do and what we are talking about the identify the Christ of all right amen all you need to do is to identify him but he is the same yesterday today so that Christ is actually the same when he was back there yes as he is now he is the same it is identified but who identifies it let me live in there paragraph 45 it is still the word yeah the word is God what God in every age has loted so much of his way and in there watch what he did he send a prophet yes and the word of the Lord he comes to the prophet amen the prophet refuse it to the audience and the audience believe it and then that is good in action God moving by his spirit now when the prophet is saying you were ordained by God okay but the the the forwarding that was happening God being the word in the beginning you were actually in God Amen when he was the wait in the beginning so when you were in God you were the wind amen okay amen but now that word which you were part of God you were part of God which is the part of the world then the Bible says the world became flesh how they didn't become fresh Prince yes what God did before he said let us make men in our image yes he says God rebelled himself amen which was the form of God Amen okay yes so the logos was the shape of God Amen the logos was actually the the that's your funny amen of God but not logos it was actually the word amen which was going towards becoming flesh yes in this year it was a form a shape but not in flesh yes it was a cure funny body amen that came out of God yes but it was not a lesser good yes it was actually God himself and where were you glorious yes because before he basically the logos yeah you were in him amen that's what we are talking about amen so you were within him when he was when he became the logos you were part of that lady but now Jesus from there ourselves then we bypassed yes but we have got a representation Hallelujah and that that is that the representation is what is actually the word amen the part that we were in good before the foundation of the amen and we bypass that amen but it's part of it's us we are part of the amen so when God now Prophet says he allotted a certain portion of those for each age amen amen he was abortioning himself yes yes the Lamb's Book of Life he was looking at himself as the word and then he divided himself into portions of that word amen and then he ordains that this one is going to be manifested in this age so the prophet also says the word intakes is actually the word yes in seed form amen so it says which is waiting for the flesh amen yes God said my word cannot come back to me amen so when that seed which was in God before when it's allotted in the limbs Book of Life As The Messengers are coming to retrieve part of that Lamb's Book of Life the list of the people in The Book of Life they are divided into sections amen this one will come in this age yes so the minister of that of that time catches the mystery yes when he catches the Misty he is catching the mystery of those names and he preaches it as the word when you hear that you are hearing yourself [Applause] that's why you respond because yeah you are a family together one time you were a Jew you were together [Applause] Glory thank you Lord you don't respond to a stranger yes but it's somebody that you have been with have been with them in school yes they believe them somewhere when you meet them in town no matter how many years they've been passing by amen wait a minute I know you hallelujah amen you are responding like the ego because that part of the world is actually inside of you amen we've got another bushing inside of you which is being declared yes thank you why would you believe that what is Faith amen yes it doesn't say things that don't exist yes notice him so you don't see them but those things do exist would not make sense yes yes if you believe in something that does not exist yes so you are believing in yourself you are believing in the word of God which you will practice so in that word of God was in God you were there with that word what makes you to believe it it's because you yourself you are actually part of that word that word is in where the form is actually a seed waiting for your day of this flesh to be born amen then that that weight comes and comes within the proximity of your life you feel it there's something about it Rebecca was feeling something I don't know what this man but there's something about this man there's something about these camels there is something about the spirit in this church Hallelujah I can hear the voice calling my name I can hear a power that is drawing me to something I may not be able to see it but the Angels they are here someone is responding to the spiritual world because you are there you were the spirit in the beginning amen that part of the world that's why you cannot stand still amen amen amen and now the bride is being tested to see who exactly is the bride is to manifest in all the prophecies [Applause] you know when you are reading those when you come across the cape when you come across a quotation or a spoken word when you are reading and listening to the cake you hear there's a voice that speaks to you thank you outside of the text yes there's a voice that speaks because it identifies you and you identify it the crying of the mother ego may be an uncertain sound to the chickens but you because [Applause] responds to the deep that is in God and what is happening there you are recognizing your day and this message and that message is actually yourself yes you are part of the world that's a man there and look at the beginning you were there but then you came this body of time came and it must actually recognize that portion of the word yes hallelujah amen and that makes the bride now to behave differently from the rest of the world Hallelujah came with a spoken word he was not looking for a church yes of a group of believers who were simply going to say oh and yes that we believe in you oh well yes we are not looking for the holidays I was watching to see the reaction yes of the woman to the camels yes God is waiting for someone for a check that is going to respond to the holy ghosts [Applause] and the Holy Ghost has come to do it again amen numbers you cannot go back where you've never been yes yes I mean so Rebecca he was actually being drawn by Isaac because she was part of Isaac they had been together in their great grandfather so as we were the god you and he was that way before all these papers and Pages were there we were in there foreign amen hallelujah so the bride of Christ in this hour is being tried amen by the Holy Ghost amen is being tested by the world Amen to see what you are going to do about this amen not looking for a church or a believer that is going to try to explain yes but a believer that is going to stand there when you recognize your day it's missing like Jesus himself when he came and took the Bible that the preachers and the pastors and Bishops they've been reading for decades he took me just stood there and say this day amen yeah thank you that's why he confused yeah because to them scriptures are not claimable it's a book but when Jesus came face to face with that scripture they knew each other they were together before to stop Yes where to start and where to stop and the bride of Christ in this hour they know how to manifest and to accept and to to manifest there's some culture of the way amen that remained of the word which was ordained in this hour the bride of Christ amen choose something within and when she comes to church he's not coming just for for some stories [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] and when that word says you responding to itself what is happening says the Holy Spirit comes to water the wind right yes he comes to water what the way so when the word is in the bride when the Holy Ghost comes verbanon says that the mechanics in the Dynamics are there why should we be there because after all the same Jesus with the same as dead again foreign yes what is the same Jesus amen who is simply are questioning himself yes in different dispositions and the bride of Christ in this hour must actually be the same total hundred percent of God himself amen Christ flowing through the blood of Christ Christ becoming the bride himself amen until he is actually the bride is good together as Adam was with Eve what was happening they were together in the spirit they were together and they are so funny they were together as the word but the Natural Life separated them but when they saw one another something within they must responding someone knew that I know this person amen amen and you cannot sit still wow thank you when you are in belief of this message yes there's something that is tells you oh yes yes you will never ever be satisfied amen why because of God foreign [Applause] [Music] oh yeah is to be at the right at the right place you know like like Rebecca herself somehow something inspired yes Amen to be in the world yes why was you not there late something is finding yes there's something about the seed of God when time is coming that's why God has promised he is not going to judge anyone before they hear the word and when you are the seed you are never ever going to get lost amen God is going to do it amen he's going to do something and when he has ordained you to see the light yes oh they were singing a rice thy light has come where is it coming from Brother when I'm says when the word is made manifested become the light yeah what is happening is raising up again amen amen and when you catch that is an individual something is going to happen amen when you catch that as an individual something Supernatural is going to happen and now the works of the Holocaust is looking for someone who can believe who is not going to resistance he is going or she is going to identify themselves with the word amen like Jesus woman something told you that this is what you are supposed to be doing someone needs to be inspired somehow to get the right place there's sometimes somebody can meet the opportunity but somebody is going to be inspired Hallelujah what did she do yes amen she read the same Bible that you are reading today yes amen and she found a scripture and then she identified herself with that description and she knew which portion of that scripture she was represented she knew that hey I was with which prophet before the foundation of the world so where is he I was with him when we were in God I was with this Prophet where is he yeah and she said now you God you are the one who only deals with the prophets you know where they go you know where you're sending them yes I'm standing here

foundation of the world she was with the word she was with the prophet before the foundation of the woman she says let him be manifested amen she didn't even know there's William and she was reading a scripture that was 2000 years ago two thousand years ago but she recognized Eighth Day of manifestation and its message which was coming with what okay yeah what is takes in this hour is for the believer of this hour to stand with the scriptures to believe yes that God has called you thank you to believe that you will be here so you are being tested by the word if you can respond if you were there you are going to recognize the way and you are going to respond amen somebody is going to believe it somebody is going to stand up and claim the scriptures [Applause] he's going to believe that he confirms his words and when that happens the holy spirit is sensitive yes he knows who believes coming to military unto someone something will happen thank you Jesus Can someone say I need you Holy
