========================================

now the fifth seal Begins the sixth chapter of Revelations the 9th verse and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true does thou judge and avenge are blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given un unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled notice there is no mention of another Beast or a living living creature to this announcement of the fifth seal we know that see there's no living creature notice but here when we come to this fifth seal now there's there's there's no Rider Goes Forth and there's no Beast to announc that is that the mystery of the church ages are already finished at this time the mystery of the Antichrist is revealed at this time the Antichrist took his last ride and we found him on this pale horse mixed with these many colors and rides all the way into preditions right they're they're way in the church age the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of reev ations and does not return till it comes back with his King in the 19th Chapter but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be see notice and the Antichrist all they them them Revelations and the presence of that ball of fire hanging there in a room to Oh Brother although I've seen it since a child every time it comes near me to alarms he almost puts in unconscious condition you never get used to it you can to Sacred now notice now in the ninth verse Souls under the altar now here's where I'm going to get some real uh disagrees but uh just watch just a minute just see I thought that too but it didn't come that way we've I've always thought that these Souls under the altar were the the the martyrs of the early church and I'm sure that well Dr Ur Smith and every one of them says it is see but I thought so myself but when the Holy Spirit showed the vision to it it wasn't it isn't the soul now who are these Souls that's the next thing who are they then if they're not the early church this is Israel that's to be saved as a nation all them that are predestinated that's Israel that's Israel itself for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of the mystery let's you should be wise in your own conceit are you the blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullfilling fullness of the Gentiles become in as it is written there shall come out of Zion a deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness for Jacob what Israel was blinded for the very purpose of us being saved notice now I want you to watch this real close they were given robes they didn't have they were given robes white robes each one of them now the Saints now have already had one they get it here but there they were given robes and the Saints already had their and going on see see they had had not the this these um Souls understanding now that's under the altar why they were martyred by sinful man like Ian yeah see they're holding right on millions of it but they remain Jews now remember what was it they were killed for the word of God's sake not for the testimony of Christ did you understand that but remember the church come in also the martys of the church was far the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ how many know was that here all right now but these didn't have the testimony of Jesus Christ for the word of God and for the testimony which they H Jews and Hitler hated them so did I so did stalling all the rest of the world but they stay they true to what they believe and they killed them because they were [Music] Jews that's right and for the testimony they held they were martyred and here was Souls under the altar after the church had been gone now watch they had in their blindness martyred their Messiah and now they were a reaping bar they realized it they recognized Act is gone on they seen them when they come before the altar of God but now watch the grace of God comes to them and Jesus gives them each one a white robe right watch come over after the church is gone like Joseph did to his Brethren a TI look when Joseph stood there and when he finally he made himself knowing there with the altar his own Altar and his Palace is thrown Hallelujah he said everybody leave me amen his wife was over in the palace where the bride would be all right and he said to him he said don't you know me hey speaking Hebrew now I'm your brother J oh my they said n oh you're going to get us so wait a minute wait a minute God did that for a purpose had you to throw me out in order to save life Hallelujah there you are said don't don't be angry with yourselves remember Joseph said that which is a type of the 144,000 we'll get later see what he did he just run right quick to Benjamin fell on his neck and started hugging him his little brother that had been born into the family after he had been gone by his mother the first church the Orthodox Church the 144,000 were born in his abs while he's awake get his Gentile oh my don't that just do something to you so you see who they are there they are these Jews 144,000 is to be called out by the two witnesses of Revelations 11 now you remember they was to prophesy notice these souls are to wait a little season for the 144 to be martyred oh isn't that isn't that this puts the Bible together well listen I just got something to tell you it's just so good it's just burning right in my heart I hope you haven't forgotten see let me say this in the presence of him by his grace he also let me see my people not long ago in white RS you remember you remember the story not long ago the Gentile bride they're there now they're always in white robes to god notice this now now if there's no alar of sacrifice in heaven where is the sacrifice for sin laying the lamb there has to be a place where that slaying lamb bloody is laying there or the blood is or I do think brother by the opening of this fifth seal as I believe that it's open I did it with good conscience with clear Revelation before God not trying to just make it think because I always was against the organization never would belong to him but it's open to me now
