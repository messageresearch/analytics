[10:32] me,
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Lord God, to think about it, Lord, in
[10:36] this little insignificant place.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; You're using this place, Lord,
[10:42] &gt;&gt; to raise people to your image.
[10:46] Oh Lord God, wherever we are failed in
[10:48] taught in word and in deed,

[10:53] &gt;&gt; Lord God. And we just want to thank you
[10:56] as sons and daughters of God.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; You have already taught us that we have
[11:01] no desire to do wrong.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; We thank you oh God that you judge us by
[11:06] our deeds but you judge us by our
[11:08] desires.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; Lord

[11:12] Lord God, in this part of the vineyard,

[11:22] name.

[11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; And amen.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; We thank God for the worship tonight.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the songs. We thank God
[11:31] for the music. Amen.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; You know, God's prophet said, "Never let
[11:36] the spirit of worship and clean holiness
[11:40] die from the church."
[11:42] &gt;&gt; Don't let it die. So, you know, it has
[11:44] two wings.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; You know, there's two wings for this
[11:47] bird to fly.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; One wing is worship
[11:51] &gt;&gt; because you are born to worship.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; You are created to worship.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; And that worship is balanced by a clean
[11:59] life.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; And this bird going to fly. Amen.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you. The gospel according to
[12:04] us in Mark uh Matthew chapter 16
[12:08] [Applause]
[12:12] from verses 13 to 19 by the grace of the
[12:16] Lord.
[12:19] I'm going to read by the grace of God.
[12:21] When Jesus came into the coast of
[12:23] Cesaria Philippi, he's asked his
[12:26] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[12:29] the son of man?
[12:31] And they said, "Some say that thou art
[12:33] John the Baptist, some Elias, and others
[12:37] Jeremas
[12:39] &gt;&gt; or one of the prophets."
[12:41] &gt;&gt; He said unto them, "But whom say he that
[12:44] I am?"
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou
[12:48] art the Christ,
[12:49] &gt;&gt; the Son of the living God."
[12:52] And Jesus answered unto said unto him,
[12:56] "Blessed art thou,
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Simon Bejonah,
[13:00] &gt;&gt; for flesh and blood hath not revealed
[13:04] this unto
[13:07] &gt;&gt; but my father which is in heaven."
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say unto thee that thou and
[13:13] Peter,
[13:14] &gt;&gt; and upon this rock I'll build my church,
[13:16] &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell shall never
[13:20] prevail against it.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; May the Lord God bless his precious
[13:24] words
[13:25] &gt;&gt; to your hearts. You may be seated by
[13:26] God's grace, as one preacher said, you
[13:29] know, as you turn in your Bibles, she
[13:31] say, he say, in case you don't have your
[13:33] Bible, the handwriting is on the wall.
[13:36] So that is my straight. I didn't wait
[13:40] for you to the flipping of the pages.
[13:43] Amen. One more time. It's a privilege to
[13:45] be here and privilege to be in this
[13:48] particular group of brethren brethren by
[13:51] God's grace. Some 18 years ago I was
[13:54] privileged to be here. Amen. Our
[13:56] precious pastor Ronnie and the church in
[13:59] those days I was at school. Amen. and uh
[14:03] as a church and as a people, our prayers
[14:05] were with you during that period of
[14:08] time. Amen. That your dear pastor, your
[14:11] dear believer, his dear son was taken to
[14:14] glory by the grace of the Lord. Amen.
[14:17] Certainly appreciate ministers here.
[14:20] Amen. And all their support and we as we
[14:24] said last night, it's a great sign for
[14:27] the future. Amen. is a great sign for us
[14:30] all when ministers could come together,
[14:33] amen, and agree by the grace of the
[14:36] Lord.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; I was seeing a a little um advert of
[14:40] this meeting
[14:41] &gt;&gt; and the advert of the meeting was
[14:43] talking about Holy Ghost anointed
[14:45] preaching.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; This Wednesday.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. I have no problem. I I
[14:51] I was challenging it what it meant.
[14:54] Amen. And said that um he heard me
[14:58] ministering in was it Zimbabwe and that
[15:02] thought strike him
[15:03] &gt;&gt; but anyhow we're going to fool a little
[15:06] bit.
[15:09] They ain't much peace to run
[15:12] &gt;&gt; but um all that is a part as pastors as
[15:15] ministers all that is a part of the of
[15:18] the word right
[15:19] &gt;&gt; the greatest anointing Amen. Amen. And
[15:23] as God's prophet said, we have the Holy
[15:25] Spirit in measure.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; We have it in a measure. Amen. But our
[15:29] Lord had it without measure.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that great is
[15:35] anointing. Amen. Amen. That you open the
[15:38] word and speak to them.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; So I pray, oh God, Amen. that um in
[15:43] whatever form the anointing come that we
[15:45] receive it by God.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; I want to share a thought with
[15:50] ourselves. I think I I I prefer to say
[15:53] that way because I I tend to believe
[15:56] sometime we we of course we ministers
[16:00] came from the congregation.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Once we were sitting where you sitting
[16:05] &gt;&gt; we were not always here.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. So I mean we didn't jump from
[16:09] somewhere and jump here.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; We know we went through the mill by the
[16:12] grace of the Lord. And you know you have
[16:15] to take away a perception that ministers
[16:17] are anything different
[16:19] &gt;&gt; from anybody else.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; It it is God's business and God choose
[16:24] who you want to choose. God anoint who
[16:26] you want to anoint. We have no say in
[16:28] that matter. But you know what I I like
[16:31] to uh think about you know that even
[16:34] when we preach here we preach to
[16:37] ourselves.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; We just got arrested here too.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. We just get condemned here to it.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; I want to share a thought with you. The
[16:48] Lord will help us as we like to see it
[16:50] this way. None of us could could say say
[16:54] anything worth saying unless God help
[16:56] you to see.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Okay. Those of us who followed our
[16:59] meetings, that quote is one of my
[17:01] favorite quotes. Our precious brother
[17:03] mentioned, "Amen. I never preach a
[17:05] sermon yet."
[17:06] &gt;&gt; And if William Brandon could see that,
[17:08] who am I? Yes.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; You know, we must stop trying to feel we
[17:11] are better than anybody
[17:13] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit preach a sermon
[17:16] to us. And I we don't want to stop
[17:18] there.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; We don't want to stop there tonight. We
[17:21] want the Holy Spirit to hear the sermon.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; So this must go from pulpit to puke
[17:27] &gt;&gt; the Holy Because if you're not in the
[17:30] spirit.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; How you going to receive?
[17:34] &gt;&gt; What the holy spirit saying? Yes,
[17:36] &gt;&gt; that's why there one or two elementary
[17:38] things when we were young people
[17:40] elementary
[17:41] &gt;&gt; insignificant to somebody but you don't
[17:43] come to church just so
[17:44] &gt;&gt; yes
[17:45] &gt;&gt; you pray for the services
[17:47] &gt;&gt; you pray for the pastor
[17:49] &gt;&gt; you pray for the song leader
[17:51] &gt;&gt; don't come to church like a block of ice
[17:54] &gt;&gt; and by the time the hour and a half no
[17:56] talk
[17:57] &gt;&gt; amen
[18:00] come to church as a block ice Block eyes
[18:05] &gt;&gt; and block eyes take time to melt.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; And by the time you melt,
[18:09] &gt;&gt; you ain't hear nothing.
[18:13] [Applause]
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Let's take a little bit of our time.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; I know these brothers, they trust me.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Right to give me a watch.
[18:24] They kind of trust me, right? I don't
[18:26] always break the speed limit.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. I want to take a
[18:31] thought from the message communion.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paragraph 63.
[18:37] God's prophet tells us here
[18:40] &gt;&gt; as I believe it was Jesus said to Pilate
[18:45] &gt;&gt; something a word I was thinking and he
[18:49] said there just a few moments ago.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Let's go. What or was it revealed to
[19:03] you?
[19:05] &gt;&gt; How did you know these things?
[19:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, I don't just what the
[19:14] word word is now. It has been a long
[19:17] time since I read it.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; But how did you
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Pilate was saying something?
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Right. And Jesus said, "Pilot, boy,
[19:26] where you get that from?"
[19:28] How did you know this?
[19:31] &gt;&gt; What now? Who revealed this to you about
[19:36] him being the son of God?
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Who revealed it to you? Did some man
[19:44] tell you that
[19:46] &gt;&gt; or as Jesus said, is it my father in
[19:49] heaven which has revealed it to you?
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Let's go on.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; How did you learn it?
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:59] is second hand or or is it a perfect
[20:03] revelation from God
[20:06] &gt;&gt; as we worship the Lord this evening
[20:09] &gt;&gt; as we search the word this evening
[20:12] &gt;&gt; we all here to worship
[20:16] &gt;&gt; is your worship a perfect revelation
[20:20] &gt;&gt; is your worship a revelation you got
[20:23] from God
[20:25] &gt;&gt; or is it secondhand Yes,
[20:28] &gt;&gt; it is something somebody tell you.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; You know, you
[20:33] as a matter of fact, the great challenge
[20:35] in this age
[20:36] &gt;&gt; is the second generation believers.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Right. All of us.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; If you ever in the realms of the world,
[20:44] we know there's a second generation, you
[20:47] know, and as God's prophet tells us, the
[20:50] best people in in the earth is our
[20:52] children. They are the best. M
[20:55] &gt;&gt; they are the best for many reasons. They
[20:57] were offered unto the Lord as babies,
[21:01] &gt;&gt; right? That's why we always like to tell
[21:04] our people, you don't dedicate your
[21:05] babies out of tradition.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; You you dedicate them because that's the
[21:09] word of the Lord.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; So our children are the best.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Other than that, they are exposed to the
[21:17] true gospel.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; They didn't get any that story outside
[21:21] of what people call religion. So you see
[21:23] they get a good start,
[21:25] &gt;&gt; right? The only bad thing if I set the
[21:28] wrong example,
[21:29] &gt;&gt; are you all right with me?
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Not very,
[21:33] &gt;&gt; right? Because no matter what the church
[21:35] do, if I set the wrong example in my
[21:38] home,
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; then I can hinder my children.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Are you okay with that?
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Good. So the important thing is that uh
[21:46] the our children you know of course we
[21:50] live in an age of knowledge.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Everybody know this message.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Everybody all of them have phone
[21:59] everybody have iPad and they could
[22:02] quote.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; If you're like time we had a fight and
[22:06] you know try to we prophet say that and
[22:08] search it. No you bright everybody could
[22:11] win. But the question tonight,
[22:15] do we have a perfect revelation
[22:19] &gt;&gt; or is it a secondand revelation?
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; A secondhand revelation will never see
[22:32] you through.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; My mother, my father, my brother, my
[22:39] sister, my church. M
[22:41] &gt;&gt; I can have the best church in the world
[22:43] and the most inspired church
[22:45] &gt;&gt; but that doesn't give you a revelation.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; You have you the individual.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; And I want to trust God tonight that we
[22:54] could look at that through the scripture
[22:56] &gt;&gt; and identify. Amen.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Do I at this time in my life has a
[23:03] perfect revelation or do I have a
[23:07] secondand revelation?
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go. So in the scripture we read
[23:15] Jesus asking the disciples, he asking
[23:19] them a question.
[23:21] Amen. Jesus is asking his disciples a
[23:27] straightforward question. When Jesus
[23:30] came into the course of Caesar of
[23:33] Philippi, he asked his disciples
[23:37] &gt;&gt; a question.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; And the question he asked them is, who
[23:43] Amen. Whom do men say that I, the son of
[23:49] man, am?
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who do men say that I, the son of
[23:58] man, am? M
[23:59] &gt;&gt; of course and they answered some say
[24:04] amen that you are Moses thou art John
[24:08] the Baptist some say you are Elias
[24:12] &gt;&gt; some say you are Jeremas
[24:14] &gt;&gt; and some say you are the prophets so you
[24:17] turn around the question I don't want to
[24:18] ask you who who do men see
[24:20] &gt;&gt; yes
[24:20] &gt;&gt; who do you see
[24:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[24:23] &gt;&gt; amen they bring about a good
[24:27] understanding of what people say but he
[24:30] throw it back to them. Who do whom do he
[24:34] say?
[24:36] Whom do he say I am?
[24:40] &gt;&gt; So he what what Jesus is directing I am
[24:43] not too concerned about what somebody
[24:46] think.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; I am not too concerned about what
[24:49] somebody say.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; I am not asking you what somebody say. M
[24:54] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you who do you say
[25:00] &gt;&gt; who do you say
[25:02] &gt;&gt; that I the son of man am
[25:05] &gt;&gt; amen
[25:06] &gt;&gt; what it brings us to church individuals
[25:10] salvation is not based upon what
[25:15] somebody say
[25:16] &gt;&gt; yes sir
[25:17] &gt;&gt; amen
[25:18] &gt;&gt; amen salvation is not based upon what
[25:24] somebody see.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; So here comes the ignorant and the
[25:28] unlearned. And Simon Peter answered and
[25:32] said, "Thou art the Christ,
[25:35] the son of the living God."
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thou art the Christ.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; As God's prophet said, he never
[25:43] hesitated
[25:45] &gt;&gt; to give an answer.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; He answered it straight forward.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He come like the Holy Spirit got
[25:52] hold up upon him.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; And and he speak like he speak in
[25:56] tongues.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Draw it fast. He burst forth. Thou art
[26:02] the Christ.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; What is called a tremendous statement.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; So here it was the man who answered the
[26:10] question. Amen. Amen. God's prophet said
[26:14] he use a word impetuous. Mhm.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; He say Peter Peter is talk too much.

[26:23] time.

[26:35] say I go build church.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Always out of time.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Brother call him impetuous Peter.
[26:46] Amen. But this time
[26:48] &gt;&gt; he was inspired.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. This time he was inspired.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Thou art the Christ.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thou art the Christ,
[27:02] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; And Jesus continued with him, blessed
[27:08] are thou, Simon Bonah.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Blessed are thou. Because see what you
[27:14] say Peter, your mother didn't tell you.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Your father didn't tell you church.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. I hope our our worship doesn't
[27:24] depend on pastor.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Our worship was not depend upon songs.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Our worship was not depend upon what
[27:30] people say.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember how they discussed
[27:35] this? Father, Peter was a trouble
[27:37] talking out of place.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; You know, uh, you can't wash my foot.
[27:42] You know what I mean? Always saying all
[27:43] kind of things. But this time
[27:45] &gt;&gt; he was direct in life.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. This time he ain't get no rebuke.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[31:05] something and they may not even know why
[31:07] talking about

[31:10] one time.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. When your young men be rare
[31:13] animals,
[31:15] &gt;&gt; right? And um the ducks who always

[31:28] don't know a duck and a hen could lay.
[31:35] They are lean machine
[31:37] &gt;&gt; but not because they lay they could
[31:39] hatch.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; In case you don't know what I'm talking
[31:45] about. Hey,
[31:46] &gt;&gt; so
[31:48] in the long time neighborhood, you have
[31:50] no fences.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; So if the neighbor have a or drink,
[31:54] &gt;&gt; there's a meeting.

[31:58] &gt;&gt; Not because the f could lay.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; You're going to get chicken.

[32:05] &gt;&gt; not because the duck can lay and she can
[32:07] lay like a stretch on the end.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; But there's 28 days or 30 days. All you
[32:13] do is warm in the air. Yes.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Keeping the egg warm

[32:37] &gt;&gt; 15 doctors, 16 doctors.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; You know there's a my memory can't tell
[32:42] me now, but there's a certain amount of
[32:43] time. The time pass,

[32:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; But that egg is not gated.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; He's not a fertilized egg.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; So the owner
[33:05] ourselves say by time going by something
[33:08] got to be wrong.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Two things I'll tell you what happened.
[33:11] One the eggs are now stink.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Back home we call it ganda egg.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; If it bust the stink of the whole place.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Sometime in church people behave in a
[33:26] certain way.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; You thought you had egg
[33:32] &gt;&gt; but it's ganda egg you have.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; You can't be Christian.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; You can't join a church to make you
[33:40] Christian.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; There has to be a relationship.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the
[33:47] &gt;&gt; There must be a relationship.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. To create that egg.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; That egg. And the revealed word is
[33:57] &gt;&gt; not the church.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; The most revelated church.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Not the greatest pastor.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Not the greatest preacher. You put up
[34:06] and you still produce
[34:08] &gt;&gt; ganda.
[34:11] [Music]
[34:12] I feel sorry I had to watch people like
[34:15] and um graph me because all having duck
[34:19] and f and this new age don't do nothing
[34:22] &gt;&gt; all having a computer
[34:25] &gt;&gt; you know we live in a new age
[34:28] &gt;&gt; only woke from here
[34:32] &gt;&gt; all right so I trust God you get the
[34:34] point
[34:36] &gt;&gt; the point is there must be a
[34:39] relationship
[34:40] &gt;&gt; amen Yes,
[34:41] &gt;&gt; the church is
[34:44] the dock.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; The church, my prophet tell me the
[34:49] church creates an atmosphere.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Atmosphere,
[34:54] &gt;&gt; we create the atmosphere.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; But you, me has to meet the person.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[35:07] So with all Moses great
[35:10] &gt;&gt; teaching
[35:12] &gt;&gt; the best
[35:13] &gt;&gt; from his mom
[35:14] &gt;&gt; true teaching is exactly correct
[35:18] &gt;&gt; just as this message is exactly correct
[35:21] &gt;&gt; very true exactly correct
[35:25] &gt;&gt; mother gave everything
[35:27] &gt;&gt; but what did he produce
[35:29] &gt;&gt; a ganda egg
[35:32] &gt;&gt; you want to know what the egg was
[35:33] &gt;&gt; a stinking Egyptian
[35:36] &gt;&gt; he killed Egyptian and you run and hide.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Knowledge does not bring forth life.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; No, it's good to know the message.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; It's good to
[35:50] &gt;&gt; I want to to make the point clear.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; To make the point clear.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; If anybody believe in church is me,
[35:57] &gt;&gt; right? I want to show off. I am not the
[35:59] pastor who want to come to church
[36:01] because I want to see you.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Since I born, I come to church. Since
[36:04] I'm born again,
[36:06] &gt;&gt; I come to church.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; I come to church without even see the
[36:09] coat. You're supposed to come to church
[36:10] even if I don't feel.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; So the wrong thing is not coming to
[36:16] church.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Coming to church is the greatest thing
[36:19] we could do.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; The greatest thing we could do is to
[36:22] come to church.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; But make sure
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; I ain't come to this four walls.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Make sure I ain't come just to have
[36:31] fellowship with you.
[36:33] with all your fellowship nice time we
[36:35] could have together.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; I must have a relationship.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Lord
[36:44] &gt;&gt; because the same Moses
[36:46] &gt;&gt; the same Moses
[36:48] &gt;&gt; thinking Egyptian run and hide.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; But one day
[36:53] &gt;&gt; he met the pillar of fire.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; One day
[36:57] &gt;&gt; he met the person.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. mother
[37:02] &gt;&gt; was telling him about.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; So just knowing,
[37:08] &gt;&gt; sorry, don't get offended.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; We all love the message.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Just knowing the message
[37:14] &gt;&gt; does not do the story.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Heat the person of the message.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; That is what will in our life.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Blessed and praise be to his name.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; So our Lord told him,
[37:40] Peter,
[37:42] flesh and blood. See where you
[37:46] &gt;&gt; all the rebuke you get all the things
[37:48] you did
[37:49] &gt;&gt; but that statement you make that you
[37:52] know
[37:54] that's tremendous statement that
[37:57] inspired statement that you make
[37:59] &gt;&gt; you know how you boast out there talking

[38:04] &gt;&gt; who do you say
[38:06] &gt;&gt; said but Abraham say it come like you
[38:08] was speaking in tongues
[38:10] &gt;&gt; thou art the Christ
[38:13] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; So
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Peter, what Peter was saying, nobody,
[38:20] let me get a little in case you even
[38:23] Jesus didn't tell him that.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; You get the thought.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Preachers can't tell you that.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus never tell Peter that.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood
[38:37] &gt;&gt; did not tell you that.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; When we go through the process, You'll
[38:44] realize power is in revelation.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; There is power in revelation.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; There's no power in knowledge.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; There's no power in knowing the message.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Sorry,
[38:58] &gt;&gt; I forgive me but don't mess with me. The
[39:00] truth will remain as truth. There's no
[39:03] power in knowing the message.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got that message got to be
[39:07] revealed.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; All right. We can we can say it a little
[39:11] better. I might want to show you I'm the
[39:13] most revelated people most of the world.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; I am revelated.
[39:22] I know all any any questions you want to
[39:24] ask me. I'm the most revelator.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; But what about if the revelation I have
[39:31] hasn't is not produced in our life?
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the thought? Yes.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; If the more revelated I am
[39:42] &gt;&gt; is the greater life I ought to have.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; You can't have revelation without
[39:49] testimony.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; That one is knowledge.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; And knowledge get you big headache.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[40:06] So God's prophet was expounding
[40:09] &gt;&gt; you know we like to take what he
[40:11] prophets see and expound it
[40:12] &gt;&gt; but himself expound this he say you know
[40:16] Peter did not get this revelation by
[40:20] prayer
[40:26] &gt;&gt; he did not get it by saying a prayer
[40:28] &gt;&gt; yes
[40:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[40:33] &gt;&gt; he did not get it by going to church.
[40:35] Lord have mercy. I am only quoting the
[40:37] prophet and look at it.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Peter did not get the revelation by
[40:42] going to church.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean you mustn't come to
[40:46] church.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Don't let a devil tell you what I never
[40:51] see.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; People always like to hear what you
[40:55] never see.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; You don't get it by coming to church.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Right. But you have to come to church
[41:01] and receive it.
[41:06] Because God have ordained men here
[41:10] &gt;&gt; to quicken something to you.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; They cannot give it to you.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; But they can quicken something in the
[41:16] word to you that oh Lord that is me.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord I see it. I see it. I see it.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Sit down right in church and you say I
[41:24] see it. You know what I mean? I get the
[41:26] revelation.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; I see it.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; He He can't make me see it. Yes,
[41:33] &gt;&gt; I see it.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; God open to your heart by his matchless
[41:42] grace.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; So it's not by saying a prayer.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; It's not by going to church.
[41:50] It's not by mother or father.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Neither is it by preacher.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; But Peter, you know what you're saying?
[41:59] It is a direct revelation. Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; A direct revelation come from heaven.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Peter,
[42:10] what you say there?
[42:13] And I sometime end up with those
[42:16] treacherous waters, right?
[42:19] But what what what God's prophet said,
[42:21] that is the direct evidence that God
[42:24] called you, Peter.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:29] that that that you say who Jesus Christ
[42:33] is is the direct evidence
[42:36] &gt;&gt; that God called you.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; You ain't call yourself.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Nobody ain't call you.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; It is revealed to you
[42:46] &gt;&gt; that Christ is the emancipator.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to flesh and blood.
[42:57] Has God revealed it?
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; It is a revelation.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; And the truth be told, revelation is
[43:07] sovereign.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Revelation is sovereign.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Right here.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; And God
[43:19] &gt;&gt; is given by God.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:22] So that we we preachers are so good. We
[43:25] like to teach people revelation.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Very nice. Good intention.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; All right. Let me give a little example.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; You remember
[43:38] king
[43:40] bring a sacrifice.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; And eel bring a sacrifice.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[43:49] Here it goes. Of course, we know we we
[43:53] know we have our understanding there.
[43:55] But Cain was one and Abel one.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; And God accept Abel's sacrifice.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Right. And because God accept Abel's
[44:10] sacrifice, his brother kill.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; I said this brother kill him.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Right. his brother
[44:21] half brother you know we don't we know
[44:23] not the brother right
[44:24] &gt;&gt; but that man kill him
[44:27] &gt;&gt; you see the you see the power revelation
[44:30] &gt;&gt; now when Abel carried the lamb
[44:34] &gt;&gt; mother didn't tell him
[44:37] &gt;&gt; he didn't have a preacher to tell him
[44:39] power church
[44:41] &gt;&gt; he didn't have no Bible to tell him
[44:43] &gt;&gt; are you seeing revelation
[44:45] &gt;&gt; he had no Bible
[44:47] &gt;&gt; yes
[44:48] &gt;&gt; he had no
[44:49] to
[44:49] &gt;&gt; tell him.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Nobody could have offered him.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; It was revealed to him.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; What gave place
[45:00] in the garden of Eden
[45:02] &gt;&gt; that he brought
[45:05] &gt;&gt; the correct
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; sacrifice.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; The king had no revelation.
[45:15] As a matter of fact, I had one. If
[45:19] you're not God, you don't have no
[45:20] revelation.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; King of Satan child.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; God have sons and the devil have
[45:33] children.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; All of them being church.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; All of them religious.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; But God had children. devil.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; You want to get you want to get a nice
[45:48] one about
[45:49] &gt;&gt; King was so much the devil China
[45:51] &gt;&gt; that even God couldn't change him.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Go back and read your Bible.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Go back and read your Bible.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; God say look
[46:05] &gt;&gt; your revelation come by your eyes.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Revelation come
[46:10] &gt;&gt; from the preacher. Yeah,
[46:13] &gt;&gt; hope we can't change nobody.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; God couldn't change.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; God tell him, "Hey, look." It's all
[46:23] right. All right. The balance is still
[46:25] good.
[46:28] A matter of fact, that happened for us.
[46:30] In case anybody falling asleep,
[46:34] God tell him watch what he did. Your
[46:39] eyes will open. God
[46:41] &gt;&gt; God saying I love what Abel do.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; I accept what do
[46:49] &gt;&gt; and that devil
[46:51] would not do it.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; It was preached to him.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; It would. So it's not pastors want to
[46:58] feel that we could change people have
[47:00] hope.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; You can't change their bodies.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; You could give them the word.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; You could present the truth to them
[47:07] &gt;&gt; but you cannot change them.
[47:09] And you see the great mystery,
[47:11] revelation did not come from nobody.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; That was the first church, you know.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Not this one. That was the first church.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; So see the first church, there's a
[47:22] quotation. The beginning of
[47:24] righteousness was revelation.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Right? There's where righteousness
[47:29] begin.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; The beginning of righteousness
[47:32] &gt;&gt; was revelation. It wasn't because and
[47:36] even when God tell the man you know
[47:40] the next thing after go after he refuse
[47:42] to do what God tell him to do even God
[47:44] tell it to you know so sometimes we
[47:48] could you could go through the message
[47:51] and refuse to follow the message
[47:57] &gt;&gt; you seeing what the word say
[47:58] &gt;&gt; yes
[48:00] &gt;&gt; all that is telling me about my genetics
[48:02] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Where it come from.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who am I?
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. See exactly what it is.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; But it went further
[48:12] &gt;&gt; in that.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; You're done taking it.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; God preached to you.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; God preach.
[48:22] God is still preaching.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; God still preaching the people.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; What that church is God is preaching to
[48:27] you.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; The pastor is only a vessel.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Let me say an easy and a hard one.
[48:34] Any preacher who stay with the word is
[48:35] God preaching to you.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Do you know this pulpit is the nearest
[48:44] place to heaven?
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; The right pulpit, a pulpit to stay with
[48:51] the word.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Yes to heaven.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:01] [Applause]
[49:02] Sometime you know we kind of look down
[49:04] upon our pastors
[49:07] look down upon ministers and think them
[49:11] see this fellow on the pit is an angel
[49:14] you know
[49:14] &gt;&gt; amen
[49:16] with the word dot and t of the word
[49:19] that's an angel of God
[49:23] &gt;&gt; you know you remember the scripture said
[49:25] don't an angel come from heaven and say
[49:26] anything contrary
[49:28] &gt;&gt; people up here more power.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; All right. I just a little extra for
[49:35] those who like to eat with
[49:38] that will take care of people who like
[49:40] to frown on the ministry and but let me
[49:42] get back with K.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; So after
[49:50] God talked to K
[49:53] and you you could see spirits. God tell
[49:58] what I'm going to do.
[49:59] You do the same thing.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; The man do it.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Instead of do it, he destroy
[50:05] &gt;&gt; the man. Kill the man.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Hey.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; So if we got to examine ourselves, what
[50:15] what kind of spirit happen to be in us?
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; What what kind of spirit happen with us?
[50:24] Amen.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Because anytime you want to destroy the
[50:28] man is a kale spirit.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; All right. I'm still one more minute
[50:38] with it now. So, here it is. He kill
[50:43] God now talking to him.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Where is my brother?
[50:48] &gt;&gt; He have God. He ask my brother. Am I my
[50:52] brother's keeper? M
[50:56] &gt;&gt; that demon so call it the greatest
[50:59] confrontation God ever had.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Can confront God as my brother?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Am I my brother keeper?
[51:09] &gt;&gt; So you see what what a lack of
[51:11] revelation take you to.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So revelation doesn't come as I
[51:18] said because who you are. Revelation
[51:22] comes from God.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; And you could only receive a revelation
[51:29] because God permit it.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; You will. We going to thank God.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; We got so much to thank God for.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; We got so much to praise God for.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; That God has revealed to us
[51:47] &gt;&gt; how to worship him. Yes.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; God has revealed to us
[51:52] &gt;&gt; how to live.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there are people and there
[51:56] are people just like us,
[51:58] &gt;&gt; right? But they don't have it.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; But revelation only come.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. As God peritted.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; So let it be known flesh and blood
[52:16] never amen
[52:20] &gt;&gt; allow you to have it. This is not a
[52:22] family matter.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; This is not a church matter.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; This is not a matter that somebody tell
[52:28] you. Amen. This is not a matter that you
[52:31] know Peter get kind of woke up now. You
[52:33] know you know you could be in the house
[52:36] of God and you get so infused and you
[52:38] start to see all kind of thing. Even we
[52:40] as preachers,
[52:42] you know, sometimes you got to be
[52:43] careful. You could face the anointing.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; You know, you feel real anointed. I feel
[52:50] good.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; But you got to make sure you see come
[52:52] from the word.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; All the anointed you have.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; It had wrong anointing to it.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; So get back yourself together and make
[53:02] sure you're saying is in the word.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Peter did not get that. Amen.
[53:10] In any of these fashion
[53:12] &gt;&gt; flesh and blood has not give this to
[53:17] you.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is what a revelation is. A
[53:21] revelation is something that God give to
[53:25] you.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed art thou
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Simon Batona.
[53:32] My father which is in heaven
[53:36] &gt;&gt; has revealed this to you.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; So what it is? It is a spiritual
[53:44] revelation.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; The message Christ the mystery of God
[53:48] revealed.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay before I go there a little
[53:55] bit
[53:56] take I don't want to go too fast. Uh the
[53:59] second quote it come from who is this
[54:01] mech confirming that thought about
[54:04] revelation
[54:06] &gt;&gt; who yeah thank you you remember how we
[54:09] read the scripture
[54:11] so revelation is not him that will
[54:15] &gt;&gt; or him that runth.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; But it is God.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not him that will. Not him that
[54:24] runth but God. and that his
[54:27] predestination might stand true.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; He could choose before anything.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; God is sovereign in his choosing.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Did you know that?
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Nobody
[54:41] could tell God who to order.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Nobody could tell God who to choose.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] God's prophet continued, "Who was back
[54:55] there to tell him a better way to make
[54:56] the world?"
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Who would dare tell him he was running
[55:02] his business wrong?
[55:04] &gt;&gt; So even the very word itself
[55:07] &gt;&gt; is sovereign.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Revelation is sovereign.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; He reveals to whom he revealed.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; The very revelation is sovereign. Thank
[55:21] you, Lord.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; You see, that's why God's prophet said
[55:23] that's how people pong at things.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; They jump at things. They hit things not
[55:30] knowing what they're doing.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Revelation, didn't the word say so? The
[55:35] word said he hides from the wise
[55:39] &gt;&gt; and fool.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; That's what the word said.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; So, we could fight about we said this is
[55:44] this and that is that and that is that.
[55:46] If God hide it from you, you could never
[55:48] find it. Yes.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He reveals to whom he
[55:53] revealed.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; That's how people p at things and jump
[55:58] at things and hit a thing not knowing
[55:59] what they're doing. God is sovereign in
[56:02] his word.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; That is what the Lord was telling Peter.

[56:45] prophet tell you better be a baby.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; This is one time it better be a baby.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Better be a baby.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Consider yourself a baby.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Consider yourself you know nothing.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; That is how God could show you
[57:01] something.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Consider yourself be a
[57:06] predestinated baby
[57:08] &gt;&gt; because predestinated babies is the one
[57:12] to receive it. Yes.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Saints, you can't get anything from God
[57:19] &gt;&gt; purpose.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; You can't get anything from God. Feel
[57:23] that you are know it all.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; No. Be submissive to God.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Be submissive to God. To receive from
[57:31] God. All right. Let's get Christ is the
[57:32] mystery of God revealed.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 296.
[57:38] Amen. And amen. And amen. Quote number
[57:40] three. Christ the mystery of God
[57:44] revealed. Good. Correct. They
[57:48] he was referring to theologians and the
[57:50] teachers in the Bible and Bible school.
[57:52] They cannot know nothing about it.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; It is impossible for them to know
[57:58] anything about it.
[58:01] God has hid the senses of knowing it
[58:05] from the very elected teachers and
[58:07] everything else.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; It is personal.
[58:11] Yes.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; An individual affair with the person.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; There's nothing charged like a
[58:17] collective revelation.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Big head people.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; We are the most revelated church.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Our church is the most revelated.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like collective
[58:33] revelation.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Revelation is an individual.
[58:40] Hallelujah.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; It is an individual affair. Take for
[58:45] instance,
[58:48] &gt;&gt; you remember the Apostle Paul.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; He never met Jesus.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Never met Jesus.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; And he encountered with the fellows that
[59:02] met Jesus.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Say, you know, I walk with brother, you
[59:07] know.
[59:11] Yes, Lord.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; I was there when he
[59:14] maybe end up with a jacket that came and
[59:16] a pants like him and a belt like him.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; You don't know message by following
[59:21] artifacts.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[59:29] &gt;&gt; I was
[59:31] &gt;&gt; my my prophet tell me there was a lot of
[59:33] fellows was there too. But the children
[59:35] of Israel, anybody walk the road, they
[59:37] walk with Jesus.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; You remember Jesus walking plenty was
[59:41] walking and walk with Jesus.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; But that didn't make them a believer.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Walking with the prophet don't make you
[59:49] a believer.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Knowing the physical thing, my name
[59:55] all those not make you a believer.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul power
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; if you look upon revelation with Paul
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; he's a
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; dy
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; he's a dy
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; he's the one who kill and all kind of
[1:00:10] thing
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; we walk with him
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; we talk with him
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; but you know something about Paul met
[1:00:18] him before he became Jesus
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; that doesn't come from no man
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Paul met him before He became flesh.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; You only know the flesh.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; The flesh of Jesus himself doesn't give
[1:00:38] life.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Believe you got it.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; You see that in Christ the mystery of
[1:00:47] God revealed all of them.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And then some of us so terrible. Yeah.
[1:00:52] We we people
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; terrible.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; We like to make believers.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And that's all we can do. Make make
[1:00:58] believe.
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; We make them.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Two days you come to church, we tell you
[1:01:05] how to dress.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; In all this, shoot the television.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; No, what you have on your pocket.
[1:01:14] Some have four
[1:01:19] television. All we telling people law.
[1:01:22] Yeah.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Don't do this.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Don't do that.
[1:01:27] dress. Can you don't get dressed also?
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Legalism
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; the flesh.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; They giving the preacher a chance to
[1:01:36] preach the word
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; and let the word clean the people.
[1:01:43] [Applause]
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; I know the laws.
[1:01:50] I could tell you what what I have to do
[1:01:53] now
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; that will dress in such a way
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; that will do so and so
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; you have to do this you have to do that
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; no is the word has to wash the bride
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; the flesh the next thing the brother or
[1:02:09] sister trying to help you he backslide
[1:02:11] tomorrow
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; he fall by the wayside
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; but when you get a revelation the
[1:02:19] preacher backside you a move.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the thought?
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; You're not held by any man.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody say tonight, I feel the pull.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; You got a pull from God.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Give God the glory. Give him the praise.
[1:02:43] [Applause]
[1:02:49] So Paul there Paul had to put them in
[1:02:53] order you know but them could say I walk
[1:02:56] with Jesus.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Yes
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; I was there I saw so and so but Paul met
[1:03:02] the person.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Yes
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; before that person they met the flesh.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; The flesh can give you salvation.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Paul meant the person.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; So Christ the mystery of God revealed.
[1:03:16] It's a personal individual affair with
[1:03:20] the person.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Christ is revealed to them. And this is
[1:03:24] the most glorious part of the church.
[1:03:27] This is glorious.
[1:03:30] This is it because as I share the
[1:03:32] quotations uh you do not allow
[1:03:38] clean worship, clean living and worship
[1:03:41] to die from the church.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Everybody could sing.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Everybody could shout. Everybody could
[1:03:47] dance. Everybody could jump.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Right. But that is is two wings.
[1:03:54] One wing is clean living.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because worship without clean
[1:03:59] living is not worship.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; So here God's prophet was identifying
[1:04:04] Christ the mystery of God revealed. And
[1:04:07] if you say he's been revealed to me,
[1:04:11] right? He's revealed to me, you have a
[1:04:14] revelation
[1:04:16] and
[1:04:17] Christ is revealed to me and then the
[1:04:20] life that Christ produced here in the
[1:04:22] Bible, the same life is in them and it
[1:04:24] does not produce the same in you. You
[1:04:26] got the wrong revelation.
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; So I must measure my revelation.
[1:04:32] [Music]
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Not like this.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody sang a song. When he drop
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; from my head
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; to my heart.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Let that drop from your head to your
[1:04:47] heart
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; and then action start.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Blessed and praise be to the name of the
[1:04:54] Lord.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, glory to God.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; flesh and blood says my father which is
[1:05:05] in heaven.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here it was. Oh Lord telling
[1:05:10] Peter, Peter, I did not reveal it to
[1:05:14] you.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; My life
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; did not reveal it. So Jesus was making
[1:05:21] it point clear. Yeah.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; So tonight, a perfect revelation from
[1:05:28] God
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; is what I must pray for. That is why
[1:05:31] God's prophet said, "Pray for
[1:05:33] revelation."
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Cry for revelation.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; A secondhanded revelation could never
[1:05:42] keep me.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; I striking to say things that something
[1:05:51] we preachers are careful to say.
[1:05:53] You know what I mean? I've been honest.
[1:05:55] You know what I mean? I think I be
[1:05:56] careful to say I could quote the prophet
[1:05:58] but if I'm not living it.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; If that is not me.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Then I am a revelation.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; I have knowledge.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; So let us make sure it is a revelation.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here it was church. But the
[1:06:24] Apostle Peter really and truly
[1:06:28] did see him in the flesh.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Right. The Apostle Peter, the Apostle
[1:06:36] Paul never knew him physically.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; So Paul knew him by revelation.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; But Peter did see him in the flesh.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; But the flesh tell him flesh and blood.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So dividing something.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Although I walk with you,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I rough you up.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; All get the hands,
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; get behind me,
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; is not I reveal that you
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; not Lord Jesus that we could open up our
[1:07:05] hearts. Pastors can't give revelation.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; I heard a pastor once tell me who give
[1:07:12] that to you.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; We pastors are given to arrogance at
[1:07:17] times.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. If you ever get something, you get
[1:07:20] it from a man.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; You know, I am the revelated one.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Or you could say you have that
[1:07:26] revelation. Who gave it to you?
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; If I didn't give it to you, you can't
[1:07:29] have that.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, you see there's a great truth
[1:07:43] God prophet tells us there not only for
[1:07:46] preachers to all of us
[1:07:49] all of us each and everyone no matter
[1:07:51] who you think you are sometime we can
[1:07:54] get too big for ourselves
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; God's prophet the good one check the
[1:07:59] quote God have a hard time
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; God have a hard time preachers
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; and congregation

[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody here believe you. I'm feeling a
[1:08:30] rebound.
[1:08:34] God does have a hard time.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Let God bless us
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; instead of be giving praise to God
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; and be giving thanks to God.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Even if I give you vote, you're going to
[1:08:46] find it.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; You find it.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; I like workers like you, brother. God
[1:08:54] bless you.
[1:08:57] A time I preaching something you know
[1:08:59] when I preach it somebody here for the
[1:09:01] first time
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; and they were bold enough say
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; you know
[1:09:08] when the fellow on the screen here now
[1:09:11] me ask him for you put it up
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; to show that that know
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; when he say he see your opinion look at
[1:09:19] this
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; put it down record it Keep that. No
[1:09:28] matter how small, whether you're a
[1:09:30] believer, you're a deacon, you're some
[1:09:32] leader, you're a preacher, God has a
[1:09:36] hard time trying to get somebody he can
[1:09:40] deal with
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; that will stay humble.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; And meek
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; and stay in the place until God call him
[1:09:48] to do something.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen. A man that God can bless
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; and he could keep himself a man.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Somebody from Hindu um I show somebody
[1:10:03] from Hindu background.
[1:10:07] So
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; yeah my feet or something.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; So man wants worship.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Don't fool yourself. I like to feel like
[1:10:20] the best thing in the world.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; God want you to
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; bow to me.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; I am it.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Look at there. A man that God can bless
[1:10:36] and he will still keep himself a man and
[1:10:38] not be an angel
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; or God.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; As soon as man get blessed and has
[1:10:44] something given to him, he wants to
[1:10:46] become a god. Yes.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not, you see me
[1:10:50] all that we want worship.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Be honest with yourself.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So don't like praise.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; We don't like praise.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; We like people say nice thing about
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; if you handle that correctly is worship
[1:11:10] you're looking for.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; I could still come back here for sure.
[1:11:18] Hallelujah.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So what it means God's prophet the
[1:11:23] word is teaching us
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank God for blessing
[1:11:26] you.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Thank God for our pastor.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Thank God for servant of God.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; You know okay I tell our church this
[1:11:35] this this way. This is I don't give a
[1:11:38] partner trouble. Look at it.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Some the congregation set the pastor for
[1:11:43] a fall.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:46] Yes.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; The church will set you for a fall.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; God does not share his glory with
[1:11:57] nobody.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; So I used to tell them back home, don't
[1:12:05] set me up.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Don't make me feel like the best thing
[1:12:10] that I ever had.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; God is the best. Hallelujah.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; God give you a pastor. God give you a
[1:12:16] ministry. Thank God for it.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Don't go carry it no way.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Humble yourself.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. This is a quote
[1:12:28] too. God will make your pastor
[1:12:32] backslide.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; For you to take your eye out of him.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Am I saying something contrary?
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Correct. Because people's worship man
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; God don't share his worship with anyone.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; All worship belong to God.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; You praise God for a ministry. Praise
[1:12:55] God for the blessings he have shared.
[1:12:57] But don't give a man what he
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; and we sing. All the glory.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; All the glory belong to the Lord.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; All the praise belong to the Lord. If
[1:13:07] I'm ever anything, all the praise to
[1:13:10] him. my brain. Let us praise God.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; But please, you know, I say this way.
[1:13:18] Don't set me up for a fall
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; because I will fall as all you who set
[1:13:22] me up.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Love me. Pray for me.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; But don't tell anybody I my pastor is
[1:13:31] the best man of the sun.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Stupidness. Bless
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; God thinking that
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; God is sharing his glory with no man.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; As soon as the man get blessed and has a
[1:13:46] little something given to him, he want
[1:13:48] to become a god.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; He want to become an angel.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; You remember Nebuchadnezzar?
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; You see what I had done?
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; You know want to show the kingdom I
[1:14:01] have.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; See what I have done. God vexed that
[1:14:04] spirit boy. God turn into animal.
[1:14:07] But idol, we supposed to thank God, but
[1:14:09] God has allowed to use us.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; For the Lord to be a vessel
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; to be just to be a blessing.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; You know that song from Benton
[1:14:21] just to be a blessing. You
[1:14:26] tell tell your friend that teach you a
[1:14:28] good song.
[1:14:32] Teach a good song. That's one of my
[1:14:34] favorite singers, a preacher, a singing
[1:14:37] preacher from the same church,
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; you know, missionary man. And that you
[1:14:43] must go and look at listen to it. A
[1:14:44] wonderful song and he all way go through
[1:14:48] the missionary field and what you do,
[1:14:50] you do it just to be a blessing.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Just to be a blessing.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; So tell what I say. Give you a good song
[1:14:59] from Jack
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; just to be a blessing from Jackie. Glory
[1:15:03] to God.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So my father
[1:15:09] which is in heaven has give it unto you.
[1:15:14] We can only receive revelation as God
[1:15:19] permit it.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So revelation is not
[1:15:26] knowledge.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:28] Revelation is not a mental conception.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; We have knowledge,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; right? But revelation is not mental
[1:15:39] conception. Revelation is something that
[1:15:42] is spiritual.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And is built upon the revelation on the
[1:15:48] word.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it upon this revelation
[1:15:52] is a divine revelation
[1:15:55] of who? Jesus is.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; And I say unto you, Amen. I say unto
[1:16:04] you,
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; that thou art Peter,
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; And upon this rock,
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; I will build my church.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; The Catholic say that rock is Peter.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Because the very name Peter mean a
[1:16:24] little stone.
[1:16:27] It mean a little rock.
[1:16:29] But imagine all the nice boy Peter is
[1:16:32] Peter back.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Peter backlid
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; immediately after.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Immediately after he made that profound
[1:16:44] statement.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Immediately after he said that great
[1:16:49] revelation,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; he backslid.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:16:55] He cursed.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; One of them he
[1:17:02] [Music]
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; c
[1:17:06] said I don't know the man. He deny the
[1:17:08] master.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; So you could think about a church built
[1:17:11] on a man like that.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Church is not built upon a man.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; It's not built upon a man.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Peter was an unstable man.
[1:17:23] Church can't build on any man born in
[1:17:25] sin and shaped in liberty.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Come into the world telling lies.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; So the Lord is saying upon this rock
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Peter. It is not built upon Peter.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Neither is it built upon the Lord Jesus
[1:17:46] Christ.
[1:17:50] upon this rock.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostals, God's prophet
[1:17:55] identified to us. This is Bill of
[1:17:57] Christ, the cornerstone.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; No, it was not built upon himself,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; but upon Peter's revelation.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Of who Jesus is.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Upon Peter's revelation
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; of who Jesus is,
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; upon this rock,
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; the church is built.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Upon this rock, what rock? Spiritual
[1:18:26] revealed truth.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; We thank God for the revelation of the
[1:18:31] word.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Thank God. You all have some bright
[1:18:35] chaps here. They're doing good.
[1:18:37] Congratulations, brother. Show them
[1:18:38] these things, right? It's right there.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Nobody protestants say it's a
[1:18:43] revelation. Read it that way. Flesh and
[1:18:45] blood had not revealed it.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Blessed be upon this rock.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; What is the rock? The rock is the
[1:18:54] revelation
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; of who Jesus is.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; What did the psalmist David said? He
[1:19:00] said, "God is my rock."
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; God is my revelation. Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; That is what we live this life by.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Let God be your revelation.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; God is my rock.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; I am here.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Because God is revealed to me.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; God has made himself known to me.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; That man cannot be moved.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; That brother cannot be moved.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; That sister cannot be moved.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Because if God had made himself known to
[1:19:34] him.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; The revelation of the word
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; is my rock.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Upon this rock.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; This rock I will build my church.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; That church is built upon a true
[1:19:54] revelation of the word.
[1:19:58] The church is built upon a revelation of
[1:20:01] who Jesus is. Yes.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Who Jesus is in this hour.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Come on, message.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; You're not who Jesus is yesterday.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; You're not who Jesus is at that time,
[1:20:14] but who Jesus is now.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Church is built upon that revelation,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; spiritual revealed truth.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; God builds his church
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; upon spiritual revealed truth alone.
[1:20:34] Hallelujah.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; My father, he tells us which is in
[1:20:39] heaven
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; has revealed this unto you.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; A spiritual revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Spiritual revealed truth, a divine
[1:20:53] revelation.
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:55] Don't you thank God tonight?
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Don't you give God praise?
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Don't you give God this glory upon this
[1:21:04] rock?
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; So, you are invited tonight.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Hold fast.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Hold fast
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; to the rock.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hold fast to inspire truth.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; We have a message.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; That message is inspired truth.
[1:21:24] Hold fast to the rock.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; The written word spiritually revealed.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Not the letter of the word, but the
[1:21:35] revelation of the word.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hold fast to the rock.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; So we write down by the grace of the
[1:21:44] Lord.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:54] All right, I'm just going to read some
[1:21:56] quotations to you and just take our time
[1:21:58] by God's grace. Amen. And amen.
[1:22:02] Hallelujah. I think um
[1:22:05] blessed be the name of the Lord. I Okay,
[1:22:09] let me just share this with you. Uh the
[1:22:12] message indictment,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; you going to look for revelation. M
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; God's prophet said all right
[1:22:23] uh
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; okay good good they don't dig down deep
[1:22:32] enough
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; to get into the spirit of revelation
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; pray for revelation
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; pray revelation is given by God
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; he said we don't dig down deep enough.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; We don't pray enough.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; We don't call upon God enough.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; 266. They just take it lightly.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, I believe there's a God. Sure.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; The devil believes the same thing.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; So, it's not enough to believe there's a
[1:23:12] God.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; The devil believes the same thing. And
[1:23:17] the devil believe more than some of us
[1:23:18] who claim to believe because the word
[1:23:20] say the devil believe and tremble.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Are we all right?
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; People just believe and go on.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; The devil trembles knowing there's a
[1:23:31] judgment ahead.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Does God change his mind about his word?
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 79 is in front of me. But
[1:23:45] Abel, we spoke about Cain and Abel.
[1:23:48] God's prophets are identifying in his
[1:23:49] hand. Does God change his mind about his
[1:23:51] word? But Abel had the right sacrifice.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; it was the blood. He realized what take
[1:23:59] place in the garden of Eden.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; He had a revelation. Nobody tell him
[1:24:02] what happened.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; He had a revelation.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he brought a lamb.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; And when God received his now Abel by
[1:24:10] faith,
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; by revelation, no other way. There was
[1:24:15] no Bible written.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; So you see the beginning of
[1:24:18] righteousness is God's revealed truth.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; And the entire church is built upon it.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; I cannot make myself righteous.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; You cannot make yourself righteous.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; The beginning of righteousness is God's
[1:24:38] revealed
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:43] Oh, glory to God. Amen. Revelation of
[1:24:46] Jesus Christ, page 15, paragraph 3.
[1:24:50] Amen. But the book of Revelation shows
[1:24:54] how the Antichrist spirit would come
[1:24:55] into the church
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; and defile it.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; And make it lukewarm,
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; formal,
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; and powerless.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; The book of Revelation exposes Satan.
[1:25:09] Yes.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Exposes, hallelujah,
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; revealing his work as an attempted
[1:25:16] destruction of God's people
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; by discrediting God's word right down to
[1:25:21] the time he's cast in the lake of fire.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; He cannot stand it.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; God's prophecy tells us something here
[1:25:28] that the devil knows.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; He knows
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; if the people get the true revelation.
[1:25:37] [Applause]
[1:25:38] Amen. If the people get the true
[1:25:43] revelation,
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; of the true church.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; And what she is
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; and what she stand for,
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; she can do the greater work.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; She will be
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; an in
[1:26:01] the Lord.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:05] She will be an invincible
[1:26:09] enemy.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Nobody could conquer her.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Nobody can conquer you. Say
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; nobody can conquer you.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; You'll remain victorious
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; with a true revelation.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; If the people get the true revelation of
[1:26:25] the true church
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; and what she is and what she stands for,
[1:26:29] she can do the bigger work.
[1:26:31] She will be an invincible army
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; if they get the true revelation of the
[1:26:38] two spirits.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; The antichrist spirit say in the
[1:26:42] framework of the church and God's spirit
[1:26:44] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:26:46] spirit. Satan will be powerless
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; before her.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will be definitely
[1:26:54] thwarted
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; as when Christ withtood his every effort
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; to gain power over him.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Satan hates revelation.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Satan loves church.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Satan loves the church.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; He loves church.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; He loves that. But you know what the
[1:27:21] scripture telling
[1:27:24] the power
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; this is the most religious age
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; the world has
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; everybody
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; have a form of religion
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; but they deny the power
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; the power to is revelation
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; power to walk right is revelation
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Satan hates revelation
[1:27:49] But we love it.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; We love it.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; With true revelation,
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; the gates of hell
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; shall never
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; shall never
[1:28:02] say coming.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; It didn't say the gates of hell wouldn't
[1:28:06] come.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; But rest assured,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; the gates of hell will never
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; We are challenged tonight. Amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; We are challenged tonight.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; We're overcoming power.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Overcoming grace,
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; it comes from a revelation.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Of your message.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; A revelation of the word for this day.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And who who can give it us is almighty
[1:28:36] God.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Cry out to God for revelation.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Seek revelation. Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; That's why we close with this 134 quote
[1:28:48] number four. The importance of
[1:28:50] revelation by the spirit to a true
[1:28:53] believer
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; can never be over.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Revelation,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; amen, means more to you.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Than perhaps you
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; he said I'm not talking about the book
[1:29:10] of Revelation. I am talking about all
[1:29:13] revelation.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; It is tremendously

[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; You cannot have a revelation without it
[1:31:57] being faith.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; because it's something that's revealed
[1:32:02] to you. Yes.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Faith is something that has been
[1:32:07] revealed to you like it was to Abraham
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; that could call anything contrary
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; to what has been revealed to him as

[1:32:20] God. The church is built upon
[1:32:21] revelation. The whole entire body.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:33:02] of Christ
[1:33:06] is
[1:33:08] right.

[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's walking in step with us.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; We don't want any Gandh eggs.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want to come into union
[1:35:46] with Christ.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Do you know where Christ is?
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "Amen, that where I
[1:35:52] am, you may be also."
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Christ is the headstone.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; And we are the top stone to fit in with
[1:35:58] Christ.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; We've got to be united with him.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; The Bom says this church has got to come
[1:36:03] into perfection
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; to bring the rest of their sleeping
[1:36:06] saints
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; out of their graves.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; So they are depending on us to come to
[1:36:11] perfection.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; So the only way we can come to
[1:36:14] perfection is for us to unite with
[1:36:16] Christ.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Christ is the word that's being
[1:36:19] revealed.
[1:36:20] Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing by eagle's day. Amen.
[1:36:23] Sing from F. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; We have been born in an eagle age
[1:36:33] by an eagle prophet message
[1:36:37] to manifest the living word for our

[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; We have been given grace to fly.

[1:38:00] and have been given eyes to see.
[1:38:04] All mysteries are being revealed.
[1:38:07] Our lives are moving from the sea. What
[1:38:12] is your position? See our position in

[1:40:31] Oh God, thank you that you give us
[1:40:33] strength, oh God. Lord, thank you that
[1:40:36] you give us revelation, oh God. We know
[1:40:39] this comes from fresh blood, oh God. But

[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every head bowed, every eyes
[1:42:00] closed.
[1:42:02] Pray for revelation. You need it more
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; than food itself.

[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Glory be to the Lord.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; You can go without money. You can go
[1:42:13] without food.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; You maybe can go without a place to
[1:42:18] sleep.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; But he says get revelation.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; The prophet says as light is needed,
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; light will be given. Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; So let's just ask the Lord and say,
[1:42:35] "Father, open the eyes of our hearts, oh
[1:42:37] God."
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; we want to see you, Lord, in your word.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; And when we've seen, the Bible says we
[1:42:46] shall be like him.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; So what we are beholding, we want to be
[1:42:50] changed into that very own image.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; And likeness.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Glory be to the name of the Lord. You
[1:42:56] have a prayer request, you can raise
[1:42:58] your hand.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; believing. Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; That our God is the same yesterday,
[1:43:04] today, and forever.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Jesus Christ the same
[1:43:12] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; That Jesus Christ is not Jesus Christ of
[1:43:19] Nazareth.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; It's the one that Paul met.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday,
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Today,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; and forever. Hallelujah.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; And he can meet you at the point of your
[1:43:34] need.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; You are sick. His word has already
[1:43:37] declared that you are healed.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; You have a need. He's Jehovah Gyra, our
[1:43:42] provider.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; There is nothing
[1:43:47] that you can desire. You have a need
[1:43:49] that's not in the word
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; that the word can't deliver you from.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; The word can't meet your need. But if
[1:43:56] you are free to believe it,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; even now your need shall be met.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Even now your prayer shall be answered.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Even now your loved one
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; can come to the Lord.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; But it's according to your faith.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; You can raise your hand if you have a
[1:44:12] need.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm believing the Lord is going to
[1:44:14] meet you at the point of your need.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; What is the preaching for? To raise your
[1:44:18] faith.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; It's come to a climax now where the
[1:44:23] spirit of God is moving. The angels of
[1:44:25] God are moving. You may not see it, but
[1:44:27] I say, "Open the boy's eyes."
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are here.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit is here.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; To meet you at the point of your need.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Don't leave this place
[1:44:41] without touching him,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; without receiving from him.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; if you need revelation, say, "Lord,
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; yes, Jesus,
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; give me revelation."
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Give me that freight I need, oh God.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I don't just need mustard
[1:44:55] faith in this hour.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; I need perfect faith.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; And this message has come to give us
[1:45:02] perfect faith.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're going to call our
[1:45:06] pastor Denzel to pray and close the
[1:45:07] service in prayer.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; But there are many hands that are
[1:45:10] raised.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; We're also going to ask our pastor to
[1:45:13] pray over those many needs, those prayer
[1:45:15] requests.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That the Lord will be able to
[1:45:18] speak
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; and grant you the desire of your heart.
[1:45:21] Amen.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:24] Hallelujah. Shall we pray today?
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Blessed father, we are so happy tonight.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; We could be found in such a sweet
[1:45:34] anointing, such a sweet presence.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Truly, Lord, we could say our hearts
[1:45:39] burned within us.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; As you spake to us tonight,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, it was the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:45:46] through mortal lips.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, a word that has found deep root in
[1:45:50] our souls. Yes.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, the word has done something for us
[1:45:54] tonight.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; We know for assurityity we will not
[1:45:57] leave the same way that we

[1:46:17] Jesus.
