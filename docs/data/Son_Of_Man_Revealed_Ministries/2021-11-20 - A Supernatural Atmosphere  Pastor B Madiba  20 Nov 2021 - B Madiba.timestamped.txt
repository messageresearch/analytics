[19:55] yay many many man just gonna remind you
[19:58] you get what you expect
[20:00] amen so we're gonna show you a little
[20:03] prophecy that took place and how this
[20:06] church started amen brother caleb if you
[20:08] put out this quote we're going to read
[20:10] this quote first then i'm going to
[20:11] relate the story to you
[20:14] so brother branham says here
[20:16] amen let's just go up a little bit so we
[20:18] get context
[20:20] not from there will kill you slightly up
[20:23] okay
[20:25] let's go to the beginning of that
[20:26] paragraph
[20:28] right so he says so i've watched for
[20:29] something as it slipped by us in
[20:32] humility and we've missed it
[20:34] is it gone and the church is left in our
[20:36] sins if that be so then it's later than
[20:39] you think
[20:40] if not then there's coming one with a
[20:42] message that's straight on the bible and
[20:44] quick
[20:45] work will circle the earth now watch
[20:48] this when he prophesies here
[20:50] the seeds will go in newspapers
[20:54] reading material
[20:55] until every predestinated seed of god
[20:58] has heard it
[21:00] amen none of them will come unless the
[21:04] father has drawn them and everyone that
[21:07] the father has drawn will hear it and
[21:09] come amen that'll be the predestinated
[21:11] seed will hear the word of
[21:14] god so this is for family members only
[21:17] amen it's by invitation only
[21:19] amen so
[21:22] telling you the history of how it
[21:23] started was you got to have a pastor
[21:26] yes amen you got to have one with vision
[21:29] so you know
[21:30] amen for those of you don't know the
[21:32] former pastor of the church pastor rani
[21:34] gang and amen
[21:36] so he was working in a factory
[21:39] i think it was a factory aluminium place
[21:43] so there it was the lunch break
[21:45] and
[21:47] the people were there playing cards
[21:48] around the table
[21:50] and my dad was walking past and he
[21:52] noticed the newspaper that they were
[21:54] playing
[21:55] under there you notice the newspaper
[21:56] there was an advert in the paper
[21:59] now what is that a newspaper
[22:01] what did brother branham said the seeds
[22:03] will go in
[22:04] newspaper newspaper
[22:06] all right this may not interest you but
[22:09] it's important for this church amen amen
[22:12] so but father god then you talked
[22:15] about while you were playing you tore
[22:16] the portion out
[22:17] so god laid on pastor dan naidu's heart
[22:20] to put an article in the paper if you
[22:23] want free books tapes contact this
[22:25] number amen yes so my father wrote for
[22:28] it
[22:29] but the point i'm stressing that
[22:30] prophecy came to pass amen yes what the
[22:33] prophet prophesied the seeds will go in
[22:36] newspapers
[22:37] amen then he wrote to pass it down
[22:39] pastor dan said in books amen then he
[22:41] sent him to the real to real tape and i
[22:43] tell you the rest is history amen
[22:45] because once he came out he never went
[22:47] back in there
[22:48] and through that there's a church
[22:49] standing here
[22:51] durban amen in phoenix amen for the last
[22:53] 40 something years amen there's a bride
[22:56] a portion of the bride here on the face
[22:59] of the earth a predestinated bride one
[23:02] that the father called one whose names
[23:04] were in the lands book of life amen
[23:07] hallelujah hallelujah so we've got a lot
[23:10] of supernatural testimonies amen so i'm
[23:12] going to call our brother joshua he's
[23:15] going to share a testimony with you amen
[23:17] more about the supernatural and what god
[23:19] has been doing with us not just back
[23:21] 1951 but showing you a present tense
[23:24] reality of god hebrews 13 8
[23:27] we'll invite our brother joshua to come
[23:28] forward and share that testimony amen
[23:31] hallelujah give the lord a good and
[23:33] praise
[23:34] amen
[23:36] [Applause]
[23:44] how many of you were so excited last
[23:46] night left drunkenness hey man amen
[23:55] amen
[23:57] amen just before i share my testimony
[23:59] i'll read the portion of scripture
[24:01] from psalms 40 it says our waited
[24:03] patiently for the lord and he inclined
[24:05] unto me and heard my cry
[24:08] he brought me up also out of an horrible
[24:11] pit
[24:12] out of the myrrhy clay amen and set my
[24:15] feet upon a rock and establish my goings
[24:19] aren't you glad tonight that we are at
[24:20] that bottomless pit
[24:23] aren't you glad there was a call to say
[24:24] come out of her my people
[24:26] be not partakers of a sin yes and the
[24:28] plagues don't fall on you amen amen i
[24:31] can say i'm one of them amen amen
[24:34] just a short testimony when i first
[24:38] came into the cross cross paths with
[24:40] this wonderful message
[24:42] i was in bible college
[24:43] and we were doing a topic on divine
[24:45] healing
[24:46] so my dad said to me
[24:48] you need to go to a place called voice
[24:50] of god library
[24:52] and there you will meet a certain
[24:53] brothers
[24:54] and ask them for a specific book
[24:57] called the prophet visit south africa
[24:59] amen amen amen how significant that is
[25:02] tonight
[25:03] yes because we're celebrating this 70
[25:05] years since the prophet visits africa
[25:07] amen
[25:08] so i went to the voice of god library
[25:11] and there were three of us that went
[25:12] there but it was only one that stayed
[25:14] behind man
[25:17] and
[25:18] from the three of us that wendy i went
[25:19] there specifically asking for this book
[25:22] that was my intention just to go to get
[25:24] this book called the prophet was in
[25:25] south africa
[25:27] but at that time remember we didn't have
[25:28] the usb forms we didn't have the table
[25:30] and things like that everything was in
[25:32] printed form yes and they didn't have
[25:34] the book in print form they didn't have
[25:35] stock of it at that time they said sorry
[25:38] brother we don't have this book
[25:40] but we'll give you this book called the
[25:42] mansion from god will give you this book
[25:43] the seven church ages
[25:46] saying that you're a student of the
[25:47] world we'll give you the book the seven
[25:49] church ages and a man sent from god
[25:51] i tell you when i started reading those
[25:53] books
[25:54] i couldn't stop amen amen i couldn't
[25:57] even move from the place when i started
[25:58] reading these books
[26:00] but thank god as i came along and i
[26:02] believed the message and i didn't go
[26:04] back from there there was no turning
[26:05] back from there
[26:06] amen
[26:07] and
[26:09] so
[26:11] as i was in the message
[26:13] one day i'm driving i was i'm a
[26:14] policeman and i was driving early in the
[26:17] morning
[26:18] on west street
[26:19] and i had my partner with me
[26:21] and we're driving along west street and
[26:23] i was pondering
[26:25] as we came across city hall
[26:27] i was pondering upon how the prophet
[26:29] came and how the angel of god was there
[26:31] and all the supernatural that took place
[26:33] in city hall
[26:35] and
[26:36] just thinking on those things
[26:39] it was a normal working day it was a
[26:40] quiet morning and i was just thinking
[26:42] about that and as we were driving just
[26:44] past it
[26:46] on the opposite side of city hall on the
[26:47] left-hand side where you get the medwood
[26:49] garden
[26:51] there was
[26:52] we was being flagged down some from some
[26:54] members of the public
[26:56] the police vehicle was being flagged
[26:58] down so i stopped
[26:59] and there was this
[27:01] white lady who was a nurse at eddington
[27:04] hospital
[27:05] and i want you i want to tell you
[27:06] something today let's watch our
[27:10] midwife
[27:11] and she works in edington hospital he's
[27:12] a white lady
[27:14] and she was a middle-aged woman and she
[27:16] was waiting for the minor bus to go to
[27:18] work to headington hospital
[27:21] and while she was waiting there there
[27:22] was a lady that was giving birth
[27:27] opposite the city all
[27:30] so i now
[27:31] thinking about
[27:38] was forgotten now and i went to the
[27:40] scene now
[27:41] and now i'm focusing on this i
[27:43] immediately called the control room to
[27:44] get an ambulance i said i'm getting
[27:46] abundance really urgently there's a lady
[27:48] that's about to give birth
[27:50] and
[27:51] you know it speak out
[27:52] it was going to peak hours so you know
[27:53] the ambulance take long and there was no
[27:55] ambulance coming
[27:57] eventually the midwife helped the lady
[27:59] deliver the baby delivered the baby
[28:03] and the baby was born still born
[28:06] and the midwife being that she thinks
[28:08] the baby is still born
[28:09] and she's sitting there with the baby in
[28:11] arms the baby is blue in body uh blue in
[28:14] color
[28:15] and no movement nothing just still won
[28:18] when i told the control room the baby is
[28:22] recording code blue the baby is called
[28:24] blue means deceased
[28:26] born still born
[28:28] so as we were there for a while i had a
[28:31] camera on me and
[28:34] i filmed the baby the mother just the
[28:36] incident because
[28:37] we had kids small babies at the time so
[28:40] it was like a sad situation so i filmed
[28:42] it i withered it baby being still born
[28:45] and the mother
[28:47] and i didn't think anything of it and
[28:48] then
[28:50] i don't know what happened to me i was
[28:51] standing there
[28:52] i didn't think anything further about
[28:54] the supernatural ending something just
[28:56] made me go on my knees
[29:00] the midwife had the baby in the hams the
[29:02] mother was there
[29:04] and i just
[29:05] went down
[29:06] i don't know what happened i can't even
[29:08] remember what i said or what i prayed i
[29:10] touched the baby's heart and i don't
[29:12] remember what i said

[29:36] and i was just
[29:38] i don't know it wasn't expecting a

[33:28] amen brother branham says
[33:31] as mary pondered on her way yes the
[33:34] angel of the lord appeared to

[33:39] supernatural that transpired
[33:42] god said i'm gonna
[33:44] confirm
[33:45] that it's not some fairy tale
[33:48] that's a reality i'm gonna i'm going to
[33:50] make your experience
[33:52] yeah yeah because you respect
[33:55] what happened many years ago
[33:57] you know people cannot get much because
[34:00] they look at the bible they say it's
[34:03] far-fetched stories
[34:04] but those that embrace it as a reality
[34:07] god is bound to repeat
[34:10] the bible days in their life amen we
[34:13] appreciate it a lot and we appreciate

[34:31] the ministers in our midst
[34:34] we really appreciate them
[34:37] me speaking here doesn't mean i'm better

[41:52] amen
[41:56] amen
[42:00] it's much it's not so much about today
[42:03] eloquent
[42:04] according to your expectations
[42:08] i was told there are children in one
[42:10] country
[42:12] where they experience humanitarian
[42:15] crisis
[42:17] the
[42:17] red cross was there with the un
[42:20] distributing meals
[42:22] and they came with their containers and
[42:25] everybody came with a small container
[42:28] and the person people that were dishing
[42:30] out to the soup
[42:32] they were just dishing out to everyone
[42:34] but in the queue there was somebody that
[42:36] had quite a big
[42:38] pot
[42:40] and everybody was wondering what is
[42:42] going to happen with this spot
[42:44] and obviously after they disturbed for
[42:46] them they would wait a day just to
[42:48] observe what's going to happen to the
[42:50] big part
[42:52] and when this one came with a big pot it
[42:54] was filthy to the brain
[42:56] and these ones came and complained and
[42:58] said how can you feel such a big part
[43:00] yeah and the question was asked of them
[43:03] did i not feel up yours hey man yes
[43:06] they said you filled up yours
[43:08] she said i give according to
[43:10] expectations
[43:12] i don't know how many broads
[43:14] [Music]
[43:16] but the lord is going to fill them up
[43:17] according to your expectation
[43:20] expectation is a breeding ground for me
[43:23] amen how many know that expectation is a
[43:26] breeding ground for miracles
[43:28] if you come expecting to find mistakes
[43:31] there will be many amen and the devil
[43:33] will point you and say look at that
[43:35] listen to that but if you come and say
[43:37] lord i'm looking for a good amen we're
[43:40] gonna catch you the fantastic blessing
[43:42] tonight i'm looking for a blessing
[43:44] i'm looking for the lord to move as he's
[43:47] speaking to you i hope you will speak to
[43:49] me
[43:50] hallelujah i want to speak about a
[43:53] supernatural
[43:55] atmosphere amen it is amazing that my
[43:58] brother did not know he does not have
[44:00] access to my nose
[44:02] but he for some reason as much as we
[44:05] were squeezed for time
[44:07] he said but we need to make a turn at
[44:09] the race course
[44:11] and said
[44:12] for i just wanted us to take a walk
[44:15] there
[44:16] and we went there and we pulled over
[44:19] and we got out of the car and we're just
[44:22] chatting as we're chatting the way a few
[44:25] golfers today
[44:26] and they signal to us that
[44:29] we must we must we must be silent
[44:33] hallelujah amen and then after we walk
[44:35] to pass to them
[44:37] then we are there and uh somewhat i'm
[44:39] like god are you saying something when
[44:42] the seventh seal was revealed
[44:44] when the seven still was open
[44:46] there was a silence
[44:48] hallelujah before the supernatural can
[44:51] be made known
[44:53] and then we walked on that racetrack
[44:56] and i looked around and i began to
[44:58] imagine
[44:59] 70 years ago how
[45:02] people filled up with that place amen
[45:04] and how the angel of the lord and i
[45:06] looked and i said
[45:08] there is no pa system that could have
[45:10] been effective in 1951
[45:13] to cater the number of people that were
[45:15] there but i believe the angel of the
[45:17] lord became the pa system
[45:20] and people had the message in their own
[45:23] uh languages
[45:25] and there was the supernatural effect
[45:27] upon the lives of the people
[45:30] then as we were working there then we
[45:31] began to talk about then he mentioned
[45:34] about this how his dad came into the
[45:37] message
[45:38] and i begin to think what what is heaven
[45:41] like tonight
[45:42] what is heaven like i mean i can imagine
[45:44] if you arrive in heaven and you say i'm
[45:47] from devon south africa
[45:49] i think brother
[45:51] must call you by the hand and say we
[45:53] need to say brother brennan amen he's
[45:55] from the she's from devon or he's from
[45:57] david
[45:59] and i can begin to imagine how you are
[46:01] dead is giving a report
[46:03] and say brother branham 70 years later
[46:06] the message is moving
[46:09] the table did not stop it you wanted to
[46:11] come and preach it but the message is
[46:13] being preached
[46:15] among the african people one more time
[46:17] amen and it's really talked to speaks to
[46:20] what i spoke about last night god will
[46:22] never be defeated
[46:24] this purpose in our lives will never be
[46:26] defeated hallelujah can we say amen to
[46:30] you amen
[46:31] now
[46:33] brother branham listen to the quotation
[46:36] and
[46:37] you know certain things are inspired by
[46:39] god that's my aim in conor
[46:45] i was talking to the pastors about the
[46:47] brother
[46:49] that a sister was
[46:51] was married to assistance
[46:53] the brother wasn't working
[46:55] and this brother was the aiming corner
[46:57] in church
[46:58] and the sister said you are a man is too
[47:00] loud and he's drawing unnecessary
[47:02] attention to ourselves
[47:04] would you just be kind and really shush
[47:07] with your amen
[47:09] your shoes are on out i'll buy you shoes
[47:12] if you cooperate in church so he came to
[47:14] church and as the minister was
[47:16] ministering the brother was silent and
[47:18] the pastor was wondering what happened
[47:20] to the brother the church was wondering
[47:22] what happened to the brother
[47:24] meanwhile as the weight was coming forth
[47:27] the engine of the brother was getting
[47:29] water and water
[47:31] right immediately the cbc stood up and
[47:33] said shoes without shoes glory be to god
[47:37] [Music]
[47:48] the message why christ speak as my
[47:50] brother will bring quotations on the
[47:52] screen
[47:53] partner 46 the prophet of god says
[47:57] i think no church in its practice
[48:00] no matter how intellectual and
[48:02] fundamental it might be
[48:04] that church cannot thrive until the
[48:07] supernatural amen is made known among
[48:11] that people amen and they see it
[48:15] something that they can talk to
[48:17] and that will talk back to them that
[48:20] vindicates
[48:22] the written ways
[48:24] what does it mean folks our churches
[48:27] will not thrive because they have
[48:29] eloquent speakers
[48:31] our churches will not thrive because
[48:33] they've got educated speakers
[48:35] our churches will not thrive just
[48:37] because they've got connected to
[48:38] preachers our churches will thrive when
[48:41] the supernatural amen
[48:43] is made known among the people
[48:46] amen and they come and they talk to
[48:48] something
[48:50] and he talks back to them
[48:52] and vindicates in the written way amen i
[48:55] think brother joshua if somebody was to
[48:58] tell you that god is not alive you're
[49:00] gonna say this is a lie amen because i
[49:03] saw a dead baby
[49:05] and i knew that the baby was dead amen
[49:08] but i prayed over a dead body and
[49:11] life returned to a dead body so
[49:13] therefore no one will talk you out of
[49:15] that experience
[49:17] how many how many know what i'm talking
[49:19] about where critics wanted it to make
[49:22] you unstable and disorientate you but
[49:25] the more they spoke the more you became
[49:28] rooted i know what i'm talking about how
[49:31] many if you if you have been in the
[49:33] battle and the devil has never attempted
[49:36] to derail you you have not yet been in
[49:38] the battle i think the elders would
[49:40] understand when you have been in the
[49:42] battle there are wounds in the bed
[49:45] there are things that you have dealt
[49:47] with in the battle some of them you
[49:49] cannot even share it with other people
[49:51] they are only known to you what the
[49:53] devil tried to do in your life but
[49:56] tonight you are still staying
[49:59] it is not because of your mind it's not
[50:01] because of your ability it's not because
[50:03] of your intellect it's because you are
[50:06] supernaturally connected
[50:08] to the supernatural god
[50:14] some people will never go back
[50:16] no matter how it gets tough they will
[50:18] never go back
[50:20] there are people that are made of job
[50:22] meetings
[50:23] no matter what they go they can go
[50:25] through losses but they will come and
[50:27] even the devil said case your god but
[50:30] they will turn around say no there is a
[50:32] god
[50:33] that is alive i will never kiss my god
[50:36] another case the day on which i was born
[50:38] rather than to cast my god
[50:41] such people have got spiritual integrity
[50:44] why is because they've experienced the
[50:46] supernatural amen
[50:49] there are people that experience a
[50:51] church if you experience a church is not
[50:54] perfect
[50:55] in the church people are at different
[50:57] stages of maturity somebody's going to
[50:59] offend you somebody's going to step on
[51:01] your toes and if you have never been
[51:03] exposed to the supernatural it will be
[51:06] easy for you to be dislocated
[51:08] it will be easy for you to be despondent
[51:11] and stay at home and they will not
[51:12] worship god but there are people even
[51:15] when they come to church and the pastor
[51:16] doesn't greet them they don't care
[51:18] they're not here for their pastor
[51:20] they're here because they've been
[51:21] exposed to something supernatural i'm
[51:24] not in the message to impress anyone i'm
[51:27] here because i experienced something
[51:29] supernatural the table will never talk
[51:31] me out of my experience
[51:33] i don't know what i'm talking about so
[51:35] no church can thrive
[51:37] unless the supernatural is made to know
[51:40] amen are you still with me
[51:42] something that can vindicate the written
[51:45] weight
[51:46] so therefore when we say jesus christ is
[51:49] the same yesterday today and forever
[51:51] it's a statement
[51:53] anybody can say that statement but when
[51:56] that statement moves from being a
[51:58] statement and gets actualized in the
[52:01] lives of the people and people
[52:03] experience that name on it's not just a
[52:07] statement i experience what they are
[52:09] talking about you know there was a young
[52:11] man that came to church on a wednesday
[52:13] night in one assembly and as the
[52:16] preacher was preaching the young men who
[52:17] were sitting there battling with the
[52:19] thought of being an atheist and say
[52:22] really is there is it really the god
[52:25] and the young man said to god if you are
[52:28] there you had much better show that you
[52:30] are alive
[52:31] immediately after the service he got
[52:33] into the car on his home to the flat but
[52:36] as he was in the car uh something just
[52:39] nudged him and said stop by the filling
[52:41] station he stopped you by the feeling
[52:44] station and someone said you need to get
[52:46] into the filling station buy bread and
[52:48] milk
[52:50] he got into the store he bought bread
[52:52] and milk he cut back into the car he was
[52:55] trying to go home as he was facing
[52:57] towards his house they then whatever was
[53:00] nudging him said don't go there turn
[53:02] right
[53:03] and begin to direct him 10 left you know
[53:06] the same navigation system yes that
[53:08] directed brother branham where the plane
[53:11] was grounded now it began to direct this
[53:14] young man say turn left and right and
[53:16] showed him sit in the house and say get
[53:19] out and get into this house bring the
[53:21] bread and the milk and he went in and he
[53:24] knocked on the door and when he knocked
[53:26] on the door an old man opened the door
[53:29] and when the old man opened the door and
[53:31] he greeted the old man behind in the
[53:34] background there was a voice of a woman
[53:37] or an old woman that spoke and said
[53:39] honey is it the angel of the lord that
[53:42] is bringing us bread and butter
[53:44] [Applause]
[53:46] the young man dropped a bread and
[53:48] american cheese stream down his cheeks
[53:50] that night god was showing him
[53:53] that i am alive but i'm not gonna use
[53:56] anybody i'm gonna use you today
[53:59] to demonstrate that i'm alive so when
[54:02] that young man if you talk to him and
[54:04] say there is no god he will tell you
[54:05] there is no search i've experienced the
[54:08] question that i'm talking about i'm
[54:10] talking about the supernatural force
[54:12] something that is beyond the naked eye
[54:15] something that is hidden from the naked
[54:17] eye but that is there and as real as i
[54:20] am tonight
[54:22] are you still with me amen now
[54:26] brother i looked into the race course
[54:30] many things happened we've read the book
[54:32] the prophet visits south africa
[54:35] there's never i mean that book when you
[54:38] read it
[54:39] it gives you the effect
[54:42] of what happened in 1951
[54:45] you you experience it you feel it as you
[54:48] are reading i think the brother that
[54:50] wrote the book he was quite meticulous
[54:53] in how he captured
[54:55] the events until they become very vivid
[54:59] to the mind
[55:00] now when you read that then you begin to
[55:02] ask yourself that we we needed this god
[55:06] amen that operated then to operate now
[55:10] and we want to check and i said last
[55:12] night that god is still alive amen but
[55:15] but there's got to be people that bring
[55:17] him on the scene
[55:19] it was william branham that brought him
[55:21] on the scene but tonight william branham
[55:23] is not here you've got to bring the same
[55:26] coach on the scene
[55:28] are you still with me
[55:29] now in the message question and answers
[55:32] paragraph 391
[55:34] as my brother brings it up on the screen
[55:36] brother branham say but let me say this
[55:40] there will come a message
[55:42] folks when brother you know brother
[55:44] always spoke about in parables he
[55:46] couldn't come and say i'm the one
[55:49] that's why he said there will come
[55:50] another one yeah and later people take
[55:52] that statement and they have funny
[55:54] imaginations but we the competing
[55:57] students of the week we know that there
[55:59] are only seven method
[56:02] [Music]
[56:09] are you saying with me but it says but
[56:11] let me say this they will come they will
[56:13] come
[56:14] a message they welcome a messenger i
[56:18] believe that if it's to be
[56:20] a man
[56:22] it will be somebody after me
[56:24] but this message
[56:26] this message
[56:28] that i'm preaching is the true message
[56:32] of this day
[56:33] and is the last message
[56:36] [Music]
[56:37] there is a message coming in the same
[56:39] statement saying this is the last
[56:41] message
[56:44] you know you can't have the message
[56:45] without the messenger you are simply
[56:48] saying i'm the last messenger are you
[56:50] still but let's take it further he said
[56:52] you see what i'm do he said you see what
[56:55] i'm doing brethren
[57:01] you are just as much into it as i am
[57:05] you are
[57:06] messengers amen yes
[57:10] you are
[57:11] messengers
[57:13] of this same message
[57:16] do you hear what brother branham is
[57:18] doing here he says i am the messenger of
[57:21] this message
[57:22] i am the last one to bring this message
[57:25] but i am putting you all because you are
[57:28] into this message as much as i'm into
[57:32] this message i'm putting you on the same
[57:35] ground
[57:36] this one is not only for the pastor it
[57:39] goes for the body of christ it goes for
[57:42] you sisters as well brother brother said
[57:44] we are coming to the same level
[57:46] what does it mean it means the same
[57:49] things that william branham was entitled
[57:52] to we are entitled to the same thing
[57:54] tonight if wilhelm brown was able to
[57:56] have access to the supernatural tonight
[58:00] we must have access to the supernatural
[58:02] it's not for the minister only it's not
[58:05] for the deacons only is not for the
[58:07] trust is only it's for you as well
[58:11] right way in your corner you've got
[58:13] access to the supernatural when your
[58:15] child is sick rather than calling the
[58:18] pastor there are times where you say
[58:19] lord i've got access to you amen let me
[58:22] lay my hands upon my baby and you will
[58:25] lay your hands upon your baby and say in
[58:28] the name of jesus christ as your mother
[58:31] and the very healing over you right
[58:33] there god is obligated to honor your
[58:36] prayer as much as you honor brother
[58:38] branham's prayer why because we are now
[58:41] on equal basis
[58:43] because i didn't put myself there
[58:45] brother
[58:46] he is putting us on the same basis
[58:49] because we are into this message as much
[58:52] as he's into this message
[58:54] what does it mean
[58:57] every time brother branham would come
[58:58] and preach
[59:00] every time you look around and say you
[59:02] know what i'm waiting for
[59:05] and he looked around
[59:07] and said now he is here
[59:11] hallelujah
[59:12] and in one message you say the angel of
[59:14] the lord is not three steps from where i
[59:16] am
[59:18] when people came on the podium you say
[59:21] uh sister you you realize there is
[59:23] something strange something unusual
[59:26] don't worry it's the angel of the lord
[59:28] amen hallelujah that angel of the lord
[59:31] was never buried amen
[59:34] hallelujah there is not a grave for that
[59:37] angel of the lord that means wherever
[59:39] the bride of jesus christ gather they
[59:42] must have an expectation
[59:44] they must have an expectation tonight
[59:47] your expectation should not be of
[59:48] brother made evil and the expectation
[59:50] should be the same angel that was with
[59:53] william brennan may he come and grace us
[59:56] with his praises
[59:58] may he move from a chair to a check and
[1:00:00] minister to your needs this angel knows
[1:00:03] who you are
[1:00:04] you know brother branham speaks to his
[1:00:06] sister as the sister was there and
[1:00:09] brotherly says to this sister sister and
[1:00:11] this this sister had a sick child or
[1:00:14] what she presumed was a sick child
[1:00:16] brother princess sister

[1:00:23] and you left to the catholic yeah and
[1:00:26] you took run about in a year without
[1:00:29] going to church and later you went and
[1:00:31] joined up with the pentacostas and you
[1:00:34] laughed to them and you got married to
[1:00:36] somebody and you got separated from that
[1:00:39] person and now you are here and the
[1:00:41] brother says to that sister there is
[1:00:44] nothing wrong with your child amen it
[1:00:47] says this thing came upon the child
[1:00:49] because the lord wants to bring you in
[1:00:53] if you run away from the lord the lord
[1:00:55] is gonna find amen and say i rather
[1:00:57] bring myself then the lord shall come
[1:00:59] and drag me amen
[1:01:02] hallelujah
[1:01:03] i hope we are together amen now in the
[1:01:06] message divine love we're gonna have a
[1:01:09] good time amen of 18.

[1:01:28] creative atmosphere the djs they're with
[1:01:31] the music they're creating an atmosphere
[1:01:35] and the spirit that loves the night love
[1:01:38] will feel comfortable there because they
[1:01:40] created an atmosphere even in the church
[1:01:43] we've got to create an atmosphere for
[1:01:46] the supernatural the supernatural
[1:01:49] doesn't just come there's got to be an
[1:01:51] atmosphere created first and after the
[1:01:54] atmosphere is right then the atmosphere
[1:01:56] will breed the supernatural
[1:01:59] how many i know what i'm talking about
[1:02:02] the angels don't visit our houses
[1:02:03] anymore because the atmosphere is not
[1:02:06] right
[1:02:07] but he says we need to get certain
[1:02:08] things out of our houses we need to get
[1:02:11] our houses in order then the angels will
[1:02:13] visit our houses let me tell you the
[1:02:15] angel when he's in your house i remember
[1:02:17] when he was in the house of brother
[1:02:19] branham and becky was sleeping on the
[1:02:21] bed and she was busy rolling on the bed
[1:02:24] and she came on the edge of the bed and
[1:02:26] it was a matter of time that if she
[1:02:28] rolled she would have fallen off the bed
[1:02:30] but as she was on the edge the angel of
[1:02:32] the lord came to brother bremen saying
[1:02:34] it's time to go and check the baby
[1:02:36] then he rushed to where the baby was
[1:02:38] they found the baby on the on the edge
[1:02:40] of the bed and he was able to save the
[1:02:42] baby the angel of the lord is not only
[1:02:45] interested in
[1:02:47] of the lord is interested in small
[1:02:49] details
[1:02:51] what is happening in your house
[1:02:52] hallelujah i'm telling you where the
[1:02:54] angel that can come into your house and
[1:02:56] be there on permanent basis
[1:03:04] you've got to create an atmosphere and
[1:03:07] your faith will do it
[1:03:09] they were all in the upper room with one
[1:03:12] accord
[1:03:13] it's amazing every time whenever you
[1:03:15] want to see a church on the move of god
[1:03:18] and the supernatural happening the
[1:03:20] church has to be in one account there's
[1:03:24] got to be a unity of of hearts
[1:03:27] the singleness of mind hallelujah
[1:03:30] expected brother branham says when the
[1:03:33] church is united hallelujah
[1:03:36] it makes the pastor hear amen
[1:03:41] you know
[1:03:42] every time i look at my church brother i
[1:03:44] dream i see no matter what lord let it
[1:03:47] not be like the corinthian church
[1:03:51] i needed to be like the
[1:03:56] ephesians was so problematic amen
[1:04:00] you know when the church is so divided
[1:04:03] there are no blessings amen yes
[1:04:07] it's just a complaint after completely
[1:04:09] yes
[1:04:10] and when hearts are full of complain
[1:04:12] i'm going to show they create a demonic
[1:04:15] atmosphere
[1:04:17] but when hearts
[1:04:19] are full of holiness
[1:04:21] love peace
[1:04:23] that those hearts create a specific
[1:04:25] atmosphere
[1:04:27] and then the lord will love that
[1:04:29] atmosphere
[1:04:30] are you still with me yes sir amen i
[1:04:33] keep interrupting myself let me finish
[1:04:35] the call
[1:04:37] now it says that we're all in the upper
[1:04:39] room with one accord
[1:04:41] when suddenly they came from heaven as
[1:04:44] the sound of a rushing mighty wind
[1:04:48] the atmosphere was right
[1:04:51] it takes an atmosphere to do anything
[1:04:55] you know the regular procedure to hatch
[1:04:57] chickens is to put them under the hand
[1:05:00] yeah but they get the ache in the right
[1:05:02] atmosphere it will hatch in the house
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:09] if a man loves god
[1:05:12] and the right kind of an atmosphere he
[1:05:14] could get into it will produce a newborn
[1:05:18] baby just as certain as i'm here is the
[1:05:22] atmosphere that counts
[1:05:24] let this little handful of people sit in
[1:05:27] here tonight
[1:05:28] get in the perfect atmosphere
[1:05:32] watch what takes place
[1:05:34] there will not be a fable among us in
[1:05:37] our midst
[1:05:38] the cripples will walk amen the blind
[1:05:42] will see
[1:05:43] the time will hear
[1:05:45] the time will speak without prayer
[1:05:54] for you for you to get something from
[1:05:56] god it's not because you want you need
[1:05:58] to invite brother madima to come and
[1:06:00] preach for you and you get something you
[1:06:02] as a group
[1:06:04] with the right atmosphere when you are
[1:06:07] united together and you become prayerful
[1:06:10] then god loves the atmosphere right
[1:06:13] there without a prayer somebody is on a
[1:06:16] wheelchair and they just stand up and
[1:06:18] say now i can walk amen
[1:06:20] without a prayer it is the atmosphere
[1:06:23] and brethren said tonight we can create
[1:06:26] that atmosphere
[1:06:28] what produced the german meeting what is
[1:06:30] that why there was an atmosphere but
[1:06:33] we'll produce the result tonight it is
[1:06:35] an atmosphere amen amen amen

[1:15:48] you're growing up and you've got
[1:15:50] siblings
[1:15:53] and maybe you do something very naughty
[1:15:57] and
[1:15:58] one of the siblings sees you
[1:16:01] may be doing something and says
[1:16:04] i saw you
[1:16:05] yes
[1:16:06] but i'm not going to do anything about
[1:16:08] it
[1:16:09] you owe me yes
[1:16:13] now every evening
[1:16:16] when is the attempt to make the dishes
[1:16:19] they just turn around
[1:16:21] and look at your direction
[1:16:23] and not
[1:16:25] and you know what needs to happen
[1:16:53] imagine if that sibling is out to play
[1:16:56] with friends
[1:16:57] and now you go to mummy
[1:16:59] and say mommy
[1:17:01] you know on such and such a day i did
[1:17:03] something that i wasn't supposed to do
[1:17:06] and i feel very sorry about what i did
[1:17:08] yes and i thought maybe i should level
[1:17:10] matters with you and make it right
[1:17:13] i did this and that and i'm here to save
[1:17:16] mommy i wasn't supposed to do it hey i
[1:17:18] am profusely sorry for water amen yes
[1:17:21] sir and mommy says my child you know
[1:17:24] what you are forgiven
[1:17:26] don't worry about it don't ever do it
[1:17:28] again yes now when your sibling comes in
[1:17:31] the evening
[1:17:33] and that day visitors were around
[1:17:35] this thing is full with dishes
[1:17:39] and after you are done eating
[1:17:41] and the sibling turns at you and knows
[1:17:46] you're going to look at them
[1:17:48] and say shrug your shoulders
[1:17:51] and now they wonder what is going on yes
[1:17:53] and say you see
[1:18:00] you can do whatever you want you know
[1:18:02] what has set you free your confession
[1:18:07] so tonight
[1:18:08] there are times when you want to worship
[1:18:10] god but the devil says no to you amen
[1:18:13] make it right amen so the next time when
[1:18:15] he said not you say lord i'm the right
[1:18:17] one to say amen
[1:18:19] amen amen amen praise the lord now but i
[1:18:23] would say the human being was is not
[1:18:26] meant to lie
[1:18:27] and if you are telling a lie they can
[1:18:29] put you before a lie detector
[1:18:32] and your nerves will react then the
[1:18:34] likes of brother joshua's the policeman
[1:18:36] they know very well they put you in the
[1:18:38] machine and you react yes
[1:18:41] and it says then they took this same
[1:18:44] thing
[1:18:45] the same line detector and converted it
[1:18:48] into a way that they could tell whether
[1:18:50] it was truth or not and put it on a
[1:18:52] person pray
[1:18:55] i think it taken i forget how many
[1:18:58] thousand kilowatts
[1:19:00] to send a radio message around the world
[1:19:03] yes when this woman begin to pray at her
[1:19:06] death
[1:19:07] they went out enough power from her
[1:19:10] until it resisted over as far as the
[1:19:14] little would go
[1:19:16] enough power leaving that woman actually
[1:19:20] supernatural power that caught on this
[1:19:23] machine some kind of a magnetic power of
[1:19:26] a prayer that was powerful enough to
[1:19:29] send a radio message 55 times around the
[1:19:34] world
[1:19:35] do you hear they took a lightning
[1:19:36] detector machine converted it and say
[1:19:39] we're going to measure somebody who's
[1:19:48] the power and converted to the power
[1:19:50] they realized that you could send the
[1:19:51] ruling message around the world 55 times
[1:19:54] so i'm sitting here and saying wherever
[1:19:56] you're when you pray there is so enough
[1:19:58] enough voltage
[1:20:00] that can go around the world that's why
[1:20:02] i say
[1:20:04] and send a message to united states of
[1:20:06] america the message will go there and
[1:20:09] arrive in real time
[1:20:12] i hope we are together amen
[1:20:15] brother maybe skip this one let's go to
[1:20:17] revelation book of symbols
[1:20:20] brother branham says
[1:20:22] angelic beings
[1:20:24] associated together amen amen i hope you
[1:20:28] get to that that just dropped right down
[1:20:30] free look amen if you've got the holy
[1:20:33] spirit in you then you are a candidate
[1:20:36] for association with the unseen world
[1:20:40] the supernatural yes
[1:20:43] when you've got to the holy ghost now
[1:20:45] you're a candidate
[1:20:47] of the unseen world i don't know how
[1:20:49] many in the building
[1:20:51] know or have experienced
[1:20:53] you are driving some time alone but
[1:20:56] right out of nowhere you feel that i'm
[1:20:58] no longer alone
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:01] it's not it's not goals to folks
[1:21:04] wherever we go there is supernatural
[1:21:06] wealth with us
[1:21:07] sometimes you are in the house alone but
[1:21:10] you know that now i'm no longer alone
[1:21:12] there is a movement in the house it's
[1:21:15] not a ghost it's the supernatural amen
[1:21:19] but but you've got to be you've got your
[1:21:21] consciousness of the supernatural
[1:21:24] side
[1:21:25] i don't know
[1:21:26] brother i don't know whether have you
[1:21:28] realized when you have bought kia the
[1:21:31] day you take it from the dealership all
[1:21:33] you see on the road is the chaos
[1:21:38] and until you realize i didn't know that
[1:21:40] japan had this lot of gears it's because
[1:21:43] because now you are a kia person you see
[1:21:46] kias around
[1:21:47] once you associate with the supernatural
[1:21:50] you get accustomed to the supernatural
[1:21:53] if one time when you see the
[1:21:54] supernatural and experience the
[1:21:56] supernatural in jail you will always
[1:21:59] want to experience that
[1:22:01] and every time you come to church you
[1:22:02] say lord i need the same effect
[1:22:05] because what you are used to to that and
[1:22:08] when it is not there you get worried a
[1:22:10] lot i didn't feel your presence
[1:22:13] may i feel your presence when i go on
[1:22:15] wednesday meeting but when you are a
[1:22:17] believer that just comes to church and
[1:22:20] go home
[1:22:21] it's ritualistic there are no results at
[1:22:24] some point in time the devil is gonna
[1:22:26] catch up with you that's right and the
[1:22:28] german is gonna create mind betters in
[1:22:30] your life and you're gonna get
[1:22:31] disoriented in your life but i said get
[1:22:34] accustomed to the supernatural
[1:22:44] i want to know that lord you are there
[1:22:46] hallelujah and when you get accustomed
[1:22:49] to that then lord will make sure that
[1:22:51] every time you come he will honor your
[1:22:54] expectation
[1:22:55] how many came with expectations
[1:22:57] how many came with expectations from the
[1:22:59] super day
[1:23:01] lord i'm going to change but i don't
[1:23:03] know this sickness may not come out of
[1:23:05] church amen
[1:23:07] you want to heal me lord
[1:23:09] you're going to deliver me lord you're
[1:23:11] going to touch me lord you're going to
[1:23:13] re-energize me spiritually but i'm not
[1:23:15] going to go back
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:32] and every time when people go into the
[1:23:34] pastor's office to deliver testimonies
[1:23:37] you've got a list of complaints
[1:23:40] right
[1:23:41] after coverage we don't want to complain
[1:23:44] i want you to connok into the pastor's
[1:23:46] office
[1:23:47] and the pastor
[1:23:48] and puts the head of goliath on the
[1:23:50] pastor's tables
[1:23:52] i killed together
[1:23:57] amen
[1:24:02] now there is something here
[1:24:04] because brother brennan speaks about
[1:24:05] something that today
[1:24:07] maybe brother the quotation that we just
[1:24:10] skipped the on africa report paragraph
[1:24:12] survey
[1:24:16] says man waking around in science has
[1:24:18] found god
[1:24:20] that's right he lives out there he is in
[1:24:23] the scientific world yeah they just
[1:24:25] touch around on his little basic play
[1:24:28] things
[1:24:33] i mean television is what god plays with
[1:24:35] that's right yes but sensibility makes
[1:24:38] it like it's a big deal yes that's right
[1:24:40] yeah
[1:24:41] wifi
[1:24:42] it's some of the things that god plays
[1:24:44] with there's some where i'm going
[1:24:46] they just touched around on his little
[1:24:48] basic play things that he plays with or
[1:24:51] has out there for them now they are
[1:24:53] coming up into a place in a category
[1:24:56] where they can find him and in one
[1:24:58] message says i'm afraid the science will
[1:25:00] find god before the church does yeah
[1:25:03] that's an in document it's a direct
[1:25:05] quotation i think yeah
[1:25:06] must have read it but there is some way
[1:25:08] where i'm going
[1:25:10] the scripture says god to the heart
[1:25:13] because out of it flows the issues of
[1:25:15] life amen there is something that we
[1:25:17] want to look at the heart
[1:25:20] how many know how many know there are
[1:25:22] people brother brennan and that
[1:25:24] quotation will come to it he says there
[1:25:27] are people that we just want to be
[1:25:28] around
[1:25:29] yeah amen and he says there are people
[1:25:31] as good as they may be you don't want to
[1:25:33] be around them yeah
[1:25:35] there's a direct how many know what i'm
[1:25:37] talking about there's nothing wrong with
[1:25:39] this brother or that sister but you
[1:25:41] don't just appreciate to be around you
[1:25:43] don't hate them yeah but it's because of
[1:25:45] the atmosphere that a person creates
[1:25:48] you wherever you go as an individual you
[1:25:50] create an atmosphere
[1:25:54] psychology doesn't know what to call it
[1:25:56] they call it an aura
[1:25:59] atmosphere
[1:26:00] when i meet brother adrien and he greets
[1:26:03] me at the airport and as we drive he
[1:26:05] will feel the atmosphere around me and i
[1:26:08] will feel the atmosphere around him and
[1:26:10] if the atmosphere is similar then we
[1:26:13] begin to enjoy one another
[1:26:15] but if they are not similar i can't wait
[1:26:17] when is brother leaving
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:26] so there is an atmosphere around you
[1:26:29] science they went that is what we call
[1:26:32] a magnetic field pattern or magnetic
[1:26:35] field is what they use as
[1:26:38] uh when they do the compass and as well
[1:26:41] as the
[1:26:42] uh the magnets and so forth so they went
[1:26:45] to look into the human heart and they
[1:26:48] found that the human heart transmits
[1:26:51] magnetic field to pattern
[1:26:54] that means around you there is an energy
[1:26:57] around you
[1:26:59] the brotherhood causing the atmosphere
[1:27:01] but science is going to the granular
[1:27:03] level and calling it out what it is
[1:27:06] according to their language
[1:27:08] that means they say when when you have
[1:27:11] got
[1:27:12] maybe a negative atmosphere yeah maybe
[1:27:15] somewhat maybe let me say you are
[1:27:18] sorrowful
[1:27:19] and you go i mean you know you have been
[1:27:22] to a funeral home
[1:27:24] have you been to a house where there is
[1:27:26] a funeral as soon as you park your car
[1:27:28] you can sense the atmosphere
[1:27:31] you cannot walk into there and and be
[1:27:34] joyful because while the atmosphere is
[1:27:36] an atmosphere of money yes and when you
[1:27:39] get today even if you are not money you
[1:27:41] end up moaning because you are consumed
[1:27:44] by the atmosphere how many who know what
[1:27:46] i'm talking about and the same day you
[1:27:48] may go to a wedding and when you get to
[1:27:50] the wedding you are not in a morning
[1:27:52] mood but we are now in a celebrated mood
[1:27:55] because the atmosphere is the atmosphere
[1:27:58] of celebration what is happening the
[1:28:00] hearts that are there are transmitting
[1:28:03] an energy of happiness and when you get
[1:28:06] into that atmosphere you are consumed by
[1:28:09] that energy
[1:28:10] [Applause]
[1:28:12] it reminds me of her brother the sister
[1:28:15] every time when she came back from chad
[1:28:17] she used to rejoice you know at church
[1:28:19] it was wonderful oh the man of god
[1:28:22] preached until you know how brother says
[1:28:24] until the brother got very jealous
[1:28:27] and say all right next sunday i need to
[1:28:29] go and check what really makes my
[1:28:31] wife happy at church
[1:28:33] and then the next sunday he went to
[1:28:35] church he took a seat today
[1:28:38] now look what happened the same
[1:28:40] atmosphere that consumes the wife on
[1:28:43] weekly basis consumed it
[1:28:45] and after church it was no longer the
[1:28:47] why but now it was here
[1:28:53] again
[1:28:54] atmosphere
[1:29:03] amen
[1:29:04] the person that you are sitting next to
[1:29:09] an tonight that they create
[1:29:11] based on what is in their heart amen
[1:29:15] it can be an atmosphere of unbelief
[1:29:18] it can be an atmosphere of faith
[1:29:21] as we are sitting right now where you
[1:29:24] are the person next to you has quite an
[1:29:27] atmosphere yes amen
[1:29:29] now let me give an example
[1:29:32] two brothers are sitting next to each
[1:29:34] other in church a minister is
[1:29:36] ministering
[1:29:37] one is sleepy
[1:29:39] and one is awake
[1:29:41] the awake one keeps on waking up this
[1:29:43] one in no time both of them are sleeping
[1:29:48] what happened an atmosphere was sleeping
[1:29:52] was there now this atmosphere were
[1:29:55] fighting until the other brother was
[1:29:57] swallowed up
[1:29:59] by the atmosphere of sleeping
[1:30:01] that's why when i'm in church and i wake
[1:30:04] up somebody and they keep on sleeping i
[1:30:06] move
[1:30:07] i find another chain at least i become a
[1:30:10] victim
[1:30:11] because when you are around a person
[1:30:13] they transmit an atmosphere
[1:30:17] you know when i'm checking
[1:30:18] you come to church you are rejected say
[1:30:21] amen and as you are saying when you turn
[1:30:23] around you are sitting next to one
[1:30:24] somebody they are wondering what is
[1:30:26] going on then you want another note let
[1:30:28] me find another one so that when we say
[1:30:30] amen we are able even to give each other
[1:30:33] high five because we are now in the
[1:30:35] right atmosphere so tonight i'm asking
[1:30:37] you what atmosphere are you creating in
[1:30:40] this church tonight
[1:30:44] you as an individual on your chain what
[1:30:47] atmosphere are you creating
[1:30:52] let's take it further
[1:30:54] when they arrived at the house of jairus
[1:30:57] and jesus requested everybody to leave
[1:31:00] he wanted to make sure that the people
[1:31:02] that are there
[1:31:03] will be the people of the same
[1:31:05] atmosphere he did not want the
[1:31:08] interruption of the atmosphere aim of
[1:31:10] unbelief
[1:31:12] and he requested unbelievers to leave
[1:31:16] amen to remain with believers
[1:31:18] and i wonder tonight
[1:31:20] if all of us here can be in the
[1:31:23] atmosphere of faith
[1:31:25] and in our heart resonate to the
[1:31:28] statement all things are possible to
[1:31:31] them that believe amen and everyone
[1:31:33] surrenders to that statement and the
[1:31:36] inspiration behind that statement and
[1:31:38] say i believe it
[1:31:41] and the whole atmosphere
[1:31:43] will be under the atmosphere of faith
[1:31:46] and we begin to look at the people that
[1:31:49] came depressed the doubt the spirit gets
[1:31:52] lifted up
[1:31:54] the song leader as he led songs tonight
[1:31:57] yeah all he was doing it's not a
[1:31:59] performance yeah some living is not a
[1:32:02] performance
[1:32:03] it's a ministry
[1:32:05] people are coming they've got different
[1:32:07] thoughts they went through different
[1:32:09] battles and a song leader comes here and
[1:32:11] he had much better be played up
[1:32:14] that you'll be able to remove your mind
[1:32:15] from your consent from your parents and
[1:32:18] you will come here and your mind is
[1:32:20] focused and you are under expectation
[1:32:23] for the way that's what reading is all
[1:32:25] about
[1:32:26] it's it's a very important ministry in
[1:32:29] the church
[1:32:31] i think brother tv
[1:32:33] he was going to say
[1:32:36] so that when the seat weight comes amen
[1:32:39] it can be able to be conceived
[1:32:41] amen
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:46] let's come to this so you get to the
[1:32:48] issue of the atmosphere yes amen amen
[1:33:05] to talk and help to change the
[1:33:08] atmosphere
[1:33:09] ask questions and really make you relax
[1:33:12] and by the time we we leave you realize
[1:33:15] it was foolishness when we fought what
[1:33:18] happened we changed the atmosphere amen
[1:33:22] now in this message my brother a
[1:33:24] personal experience with god
[1:33:27] paragraph 48
[1:33:29] brother brown said let me while they are
[1:33:31] lining up with the people let me ask
[1:33:33] this
[1:33:34] how many he believes that the most
[1:33:36] essential thing
[1:33:45] yes
[1:33:46] because
[1:33:47] there's a spirit of neglect in the end
[1:33:49] time yeah that's right now i'm going to
[1:33:52] give you a little secret
[1:33:54] if you love people
[1:33:56] people will know
[1:33:58] amen when you love people you don't need
[1:34:00] to announce amen when people are in your
[1:34:03] atmosphere
[1:34:04] they can sense in life
[1:34:06] are you still with me
[1:34:08] that says did you know
[1:34:10] that man is a creator in himself yeah
[1:34:14] amen how many believe that
[1:34:16] he is the son of god
[1:34:18] in his fallen condition amen that means
[1:34:21] wherever you go you as a son of god you
[1:34:24] create an atmosphere amen that's why you
[1:34:27] as the son of god if you're at work
[1:34:30] people are complaining don't join in
[1:34:32] that's right separate yourself yes you
[1:34:34] are off a different maker
[1:34:36] you're off a different material if you
[1:34:39] complain as they complain you're gonna
[1:34:41] be solid by other atmosphere but you
[1:34:44] need to step back and say hang on i'm a
[1:34:46] son of god i'm a creator yeah brother
[1:34:48] frederick walked into the house and
[1:34:50] sister mirey is nervous the children are
[1:34:53] there is chaotic brother
[1:34:55] he realized i am a son of god i'm a
[1:34:58] creator i'm gonna change an atmosphere
[1:35:01] and even tonight when we come here no
[1:35:03] matter what you're going through we can
[1:35:05] change your atmosphere
[1:35:07] no matter what the atmosphere looks like
[1:35:09] at all we can change the atmosphere in
[1:35:11] your house
[1:35:13] and when you leave here you will take
[1:35:15] the supernatural atmosphere back to your
[1:35:17] house
[1:35:19] and what makes the demons typical to be
[1:35:22] able to stay in the presence of the son
[1:35:24] of god it is the atmosphere around the
[1:35:27] son of god it is the atmosphere around
[1:35:29] the church of god
[1:35:32] you know pastor trump as we travel you
[1:35:35] know being a message pastor you've got
[1:35:37] to be discerning
[1:35:38] if brother brother puts me into a hotel
[1:35:40] and i
[1:35:41] when i walk into the hotel it's not a
[1:35:43] matter of just to walk in and be excited
[1:35:45] and say i'm now in nowhere to know the
[1:35:47] first thing before i do anything you
[1:35:49] knelt down it's a lord i'm in this hotel
[1:35:53] amen room i don't know what happened but
[1:35:55] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:35:58] number of days that i will be here i'm a
[1:36:00] son of god there must be a heavenly
[1:36:02] atmosphere
[1:36:04] amen hallelujah brother walked into a
[1:36:07] tail and said look change my hotel room
[1:36:09] yeah they committed adultery a night
[1:36:12] before yes amen
[1:36:14] it's when you understand the atmosphere
[1:36:17] amen i hope i'm too i'm i hope you are
[1:36:20] with me amen
[1:36:23] divine 100.
[1:36:25] paragraph 47
[1:36:26] he said now it's a strange thing that
[1:36:29] how that people
[1:36:30] the type of people and what we do in our
[1:36:33] association
[1:36:34] now we all have to face this effects
[1:36:37] that there is people that you just love
[1:36:39] to be around amen
[1:36:42] and there's people that find people and
[1:36:44] you love them but yet there is something
[1:36:46] about you the person that you just can't
[1:36:48] hardly stay around them
[1:36:50] now you want to talk of it now the
[1:36:52] reason that is is because of the
[1:36:54] atmosphere that the individual himself
[1:36:57] or herself create that's why you young
[1:36:59] ones you must listen to your parents
[1:37:02] if your parent says that's not a good
[1:37:04] friend don't justify there is something
[1:37:06] that the parents sensed
[1:37:08] they may not be able to pinpoint and say
[1:37:11] this is the problem but the sense of the
[1:37:13] atmosphere around your friend
[1:37:15] and if you are respectful you say i may
[1:37:17] not understand but i'm gonna cut ties
[1:37:19] with this
[1:37:20] it will save you a lot of heartache yes
[1:37:23] sir amen amen
[1:37:27] we found out that the heart creates an
[1:37:29] atmosphere praise the lord now
[1:37:32] first
[1:37:33] if somebody moves from wheat bank
[1:37:36] and comes to fellowship here in phoenix
[1:37:41] and maybe there's a complainer in church
[1:37:45] without anybody telling them who is the
[1:37:47] complainer
[1:37:48] in no time
[1:37:50] they will be friendly complain
[1:37:52] because the spirit
[1:37:54] identifying a spirit that's why the
[1:37:56] english sin says misery
[1:37:59] loves company
[1:38:06] yeah
[1:38:07] no brother let's come to the book of
