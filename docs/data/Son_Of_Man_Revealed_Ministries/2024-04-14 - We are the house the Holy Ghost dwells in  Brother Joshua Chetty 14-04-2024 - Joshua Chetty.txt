always talks about preaching Christ H not not preaching about Christ but preaching Christ that the gospel that we preach is Christ amen and because this message of the hour reveals Christ and when Christ is revealed we are revealed it tells us who we are and we know that that is the key for the Rapture amen that when the bride knows who she is the rapture takes Hallelujah and that's exactly what is unfolding in us that is what's unfolding with all the ministration of the word revealing Christ revealing you so that soon and very soon we may be with him may his Blessing rest upon you may

fivefold ministry amen we appreciate God's gifts and whenever they year we do get blessed amen amen without further Ado we'll open our Bibles to the book of 2 Chronicles reading from chapter [Music] 7 I'm going to speak on a few things that was already spoken by past Adan and myself during the course of the year just to bring to you in remembrance and to put things in context amen uh I believe that the Lord is always taking us back to certain things to establish us amen amen and then from there we look at where the Lord is working right now amen cuz I believe the gospel is Progressive amen yes amen the gospel is oh we also have another brother visiting us God bless you brother the back brother Sun God bless you pray you enjoy the word this morning I don't know if there's any other visitors I pray that the Lord will bless each one of you amen so you find that the the the gospel is there to take us somewhere amen amen because the gospel is not there to give us religion we not just here as a form of religion to come week after week and here a sermon this gospel is taking us on a journey amen Redemption is a complete work amen Redemption must take us back to the original condition that we was in the condition that man fell from In the Garden of Eden amen amen so it didn't just stop at Calvary amen it was progressing amen yes so it goes beyond what people think religion uh this this walk this Christian walk is about it's about taking us back to our rightful condition am you take us back to what was lost amen and it couldn't be done in any other age but it had to be done in the adoption age it had to be done in the time when the when the church was ready to come amen the body of Christ could come right now ready for the edstone amen you have to be in this age when The Headstone came down to connect with the body am now we have the mind of Christ and when we have the mind of Christ now we are seated here in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen the book of Chronicles chapter 7 now when Solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven amen and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house amen and the priest could not enter into the house because the glory of the Lord had filled the house amen amen we also turn now to the book of egi chapter 2 book of ha chapter 2 in the seventh month in the 1 and 120th day of the month came the word of the Lord by the prophet AGI is saying speak now to zerubabel the son of chel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of josc the high priest now we find that uh zerubabel would have been the king of Judah had they been in in their Kingdom but yeah they are in captivity yeah under the Persian rule so he is the governor and we find that Joshua being the high priest he's coming from the levitical priesthood lineage because you cannot be a priest uh unless you come from the litical lineage you cannot be a king unless you come from it's Ed it's edit right you have to come from the line of Judah amen so to Joshua the son of remember all this is happening now around about 500 some BC the high priest now we know so said if they wasn't under that persan Dominion he would have been King and what Joshua means Jehovah savior amen amen amen and to the residue of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in a first Glory so there was a house in his first Glory and that's what the one we read now in 2 Chronicles 7 the the house that Solomon buils when the sh Glory came down amen when Solomon we know that when Solomon built the temple it was the type of the Bride amen because when you think about the temple do not think of a physical building let's come up a little higher this morning amen am the word has come to open our eyes of understanding amen when we look at it when you think about a temple we think about a physical building but we are the temple of God am and the temple is St being gind and when Solomon went to the temple he's typing Christ but greater than Solomon is here amen amen and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing amen so when you look at the bride when you look at your brother and sister you have to see them through the blood you have to see them faultless you have to see them as Christ sees them yet now be strong oh zerel say the Lord and be strong oh Joshua son of jedc the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land say the Lord and work for I am with you say the Lord of hosts am amen so you all go all of the fults and everything there God shows the AI the prophet he said I am still with you amen you see God keeps his own Covenant amen because this covenant not you or I do amen it's what he promised and God swore by an O to confirm this Covenant Hallelujah you can deny him but he don't deny you thank you Lord Peter denied him but he didn't deny Peter to give him the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you may be seated sorry for that and verse 5 says according to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remained among you amen fear ye not now that I'm thinking that I'm reading this and this is referring to the time when it was under Persian rule we know the the ancient Persian ire is now Iran and and and while we were sleeping last night Iran attacked Israel they send drones out there to Israel so fear ye not for thus say the Lord of host yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens oh yes and the Earth yes and the Sea and the dry lands and I will shake all na Nations am oh how we living the time where all nations are shaking right now how we living the time where we can we know that Israel is our time piece Israel is all over the news and he said watch Russia watch Russia watch Russia Russia is in the news nations are breaking all over all nations are shaking they don't know what's everyone is scared now because they all don't know what's going to happen because of this Middle East crisis right now amen we find but this is the time where Israel is now back in the Homeland amen so all the focus is there but while all this is happening we know that between the sixth and the seventh trumpet when Israel was coming back in the Homeland there was a root coming in yes sir amen we know that there's a bride on the Earth right now who had an invisible you an invisible Union amen amen where the world knows nothing about it amen and God has been dealing with with there all these years because the message was stood up for her from every nation from every tribe and every Kindred God has been dealing with her and we find that the church World left Christ they put him out of the church the minute they put him out of the church he started working with his bride amen and then when he started working the bride amen he started building up through his word amen we have the word we had the mechanics all his years amen but he promised the Dynamics amen amen there had to be a filling again of the Holy Ghost amen amen and what is the sh glory of God it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen amen amen he said yes it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house with glory amen amen yes so we speaking this morning on this house that's filled with glory amen we want to talk about this house amen amen because the glory of God is Not Just in any house yes God doesn't just go and put his glory anyway amen God has a certain place to come and put his glory in amen so this house that's full with his glory amen have has to be on the earth because she has to be the one that has to manifest his glory amen he said I will fill this house with Glory say the Lord of hosts the silver is mine and the gold is mine say the Lord of hosts the glory of this letter house shall be greater than that of the former say the Lord of hosts and in this place I will give peace say the Lord of hosts amen amen you find that the first H was already gone but he was talking about the glory that was in the first house but now there was another house standing there at the end of the 70 70 years because now it's the end of the 70 years and now the decree is given for to go and build another house amen amen but the first house we find in the Book of Solomon that sh of Glory comes down but this house that's going to be ready now is not going to be the glory of God coming down as it was in the first house people are going to mistake it because God is going to come now veiled In the Flesh will in human flesh amen and where you find that you find that in the Book of John chapter 7 when he's going to the Feast of Tabernacles amen and we find there let's open that to St John chapter 7 let's read it let's read it to good context and after this thing Jesus walked in Galilee for he would not walk in jewelry because the Jews sought to kill him now the Jews Feast of Tabernacles was at end we know the three main Feast for the year and the Tabernacle was the third Feast which was done in the seventh month amen take note of this this Feast is in the seventh month and in the in the Feast of Tabernacle there's an in gathering amen am amen there's a gathering amen and in the Feast of Tabernacle is for chain Dwelling Places now his Brethren therefore said unto him depart in and go into Judea that thy disciples Also may see the works that thou doest for there is no man that doeth anything in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things show thyself to the world for neither did his Brethren believe in him then Jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is always ready the world cannot hate you but it at but me it hate it because I testify of it that the works thereof are evil go ye up unto this Feast I go not up yet unto this Feast for my time is not yet full come when he said had said these words unto them he abod still in Galilee but when his Brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feasts not openly but as it were in secrets and said then the Jews sought him at the feast and said where is he isn't that the same thing today where is Christ where is the god of the Bible but they can't see it in you and I amen if anyone want to see Jesus said if you seen me you seen Jesus amen because I am the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost your brother is the Temple of the Holy Ghost your sister is the Temple of the Holy Ghost if you stop looking through the kindal eyes and look at it Through The Eyes Of God amen amen he that is earthy is earthy amen he that is of the spirit of the of the spirit amen if you think of fleshly things and caral things that's how you seing but if you are in the spirit if you are connected with the spirit amen you speak God in that person oh yes you will recognize where Jesus is today amen when they build the first temple imagine the sh Glory came down Jonah could lie upon that yes he could remember the prayer of Solomon when he said Lord if the people could look to this Temple yes amen so Jonah could lie upon that when he was in a in a fish of the in a in the belly of the fish yeah he could lie on the prayer and he could look towards the temple amen amen there's coming an hour right now where people need to rely upon you and I as the temple of God get need to look into you amen that's the Bible said if you remit someone's sins they shall be forgiven amen oh yes amen amen wonderful God is bringing brought us back this message has come to bring us back to the full restoration of who we truly are the seven tund has come to awaken us take out of Amnesia and show that you are a son and daughter of God that you are going back to Dominion again amen that you are the temple right now where the Holy Ghost is dwelling in you are the house of God Amen Hallelujah you are is a Bolding place thank you Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen amen then the Jews sought him at the field said where is he and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he's a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people how be no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews didn't they say the same thing this day when son of man is being revealed again when son of man is being in the M when when when the when he come the Son of God he was turned away they they shut the door let him out of the church then he come the son of man amen amen he was a son of man revealing the son of man and when they looked at son of man said no but he was a good man then he was a prophet but they couldn't see what of the ministry the true Ministry this was the messenger of the age this was the messenger that will come and when he comes down when he's he when he's on the scene the mighty angel will come down and bring the book The open book amen and giv the open book to spad it out so that there will be a bride that will receive this word that will take this word and eat this word amen and they will digest it and become part of that word amen yes they will connect to that word thank you amen so he said he's a good man other said no but deceiveth the people how be no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews now about the midst of the Feast of the Jews went up of the feast Jesus went up into the temple now watch here comes the sh Glory now all that was in God into Christ amen and all that was in Christ heo to his church because locked up in Jesus is the bride the mystery locked up in Jesus is the bride and the bride could only be taken out where when he was put asleep on Calvary but you were locked up in him all the time amen amen but there he goes now walking into the temple amen because this Temple when this Temple was built it nevered the sh Glory but here now because there was Solomon's Temple and then Solomon's Temple was destroyed and they went into captivity but now this is EGA you know gave the decree cus gave the decree to go forth that he must go now and build his Temple and the temple was built remember when when they got this Temple but now Jesus walks into this Temple now and the Jew Jews Marvel saying how know it this man's letters having never learns and Jesus answered them and said my Doctrine is not mine amen but he that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God whether I speak of myself oh yeah he that speak of himself seeketh his own Glory yeah but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him amen he said did not Moses give you the law and yet none of you keep it the law but go you about to kill me the people answered and said thou as a devil oh God about to kill thee Jesus answered and said unto them I have done one work and you all Marvel Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision yes and Y on the Sabbath day circumcised a man if a man on the Sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of Moses should not be broken are you angry at me because I have made a man every withhold on the Sabbath day judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgments you see what he saying judge not according to appearance yes don't look to the flesh look Beyond the Veil amen amen today we're going to go and look Beyond the Veil amen cuz we looking at the house amen where the glory of God is dwelling in amen amen we looking at the house that the Holy Ghost saw it fit that I will come and dwell in this house yes there was a former house that we looked at the former glory that we looked at amen because there had to be the first fruits at Pentecost amen but this Glory shall be greater than the former glory amen we look at the book of Acts and we see it there we see the glory in the book of acts we see the first church in the book of Acts amen but now there has to be a continuity of the book of Acts and Jesus said in this hour Greater Works and is ye shall do amen yes John 14:12 amen he said ye shall do the Greater Works amen he said but judge righteous judgment then said some of them of Jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill but Lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him do the rulers out do the rulers out indeed that this is the very Christ how be it we know this man when he is but when Christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is you see because they were looking for him in a certain way they was looking at to find him through intellects amen and that's the same thing today people are looking for Christ to appear for Christ to appear but they don't realize what really happened in his day amen that it was an invisible Union amen it's not the way they seem that's why the Rapture is not a public show am the Rapture is a secret amen amen at the end of the seven churches when did they go to build a temple at the end of the seven decade after 70 years and yeah at the end of the seven Church age when the church ages run out amen then he comes down amen he comes down with inheritance yes to give title Deeds amen amen to a group of people to say right all that was lost in the Garden of Eden now you are being restored back to that back to having Dominion again amen back to having possession again back to knowing how to live a good Christian life amen before you couldn't control your temper you didn't not to handle situations because you were doing it kindly but now I will come and dwell in you it not be you that speak it I will speak through you amen amen then Christ Jesus is in the temple as he thought saying ye both know me and ye know whence I am and I am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not but I know him for I am from him and he had sent me then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come and many of the people believed on him and said when Christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man had done so you saw you see what's happening there the secret right there Jesus walking in the temple amen and not being recognized yes yes because they're looking for the what happened in the time of Solomon looking waiting for that to happen but Jesus walking right there in the temp amen right there when at The Seven Feast sorry at the Feast of Tabernacle in the seventh month Amen in John 7 amen amen amen yes praise the Lord amen so we find that so we have this house here right now at the end of the seven Church age because he took this house six seven Church ages to build amen building blocks Paul was the master builder then one messenger after the other receiving the message for the age building and building then we find it coming now to the stature of the perfect man amen amen climbing up the seven steps to Perfection ready ready for what ready for the edstone amen amen amen and remember when Solomon's Temple was being built he built uh nothing was done there there was no cutting of bricks in Breaking of bricks or blocks in there in Israel it was done from different parts amen of the uh the around them but not in Israel not there where the temple was put together so yeah you find from different Nation different tongues different kindreds amen amen this bride is being put together amen coming what to the pyramid City amen coming for to the perfect pyramid for The Headstone Amen to to come and cap it yes amen amen because why the glory of God must come and dwell in US amen yes then it is who walking on the earth amen when the body of Christ is walking the body of Christ is walking on Earth it's Christ walking on the Earth again amen amen there had to be a resurrection a spiritual resurrection of this body Amen to come into its fullness amen and when it's done is coming to the age of maturity thank you Lord it when can come to an Ephesian church when I was a child I spake like a child I ate like a child I acted like a child but now when you come mature now you know how to handle the words amen God entrust you with his word amen God has confidence with you with his words amen and now when it comes the time when he say now speak the word amen amen why cry speak you cried as a baby I gave you those gifts I gave you those things to keep you by but now why cry speak amen amen you facing your circumstances you facing your situation why C speak yes amen thank you Lord amen now you are hand all things maturely through the word amen amen the first house the Alpha House is not here but we remember a glory amen we remember we look at the book of Acts we can see it we can see the glory in the book of Acts but he said but this house the glory year will be greater John 14:12 says verily very I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do he do also and greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father what makes this the Greater Works in this age what makes this Glory greater is because there's going to be people that are living here that are literally that are literally going to change from Mortal to immortality they are literally going to change from this Dimension to another dimension amen amen amen amen and you are living in the dark is the hardest age to live in 200 Millions on the demons on the earth amen just like how those drones are hitting Israel right now flying after to them and they got us iron D to protect themselves just like we got the shield of Faith amen we got the anointing in his age the anointing of the Flying Eagle to overcome every demon power in his age to every to overcome every onslaught of the enemy we not unaware of Satan's schemes and tactics we have been we have been taught we have been told through the word amen what Satan is up to in this hour amen God has shown us through the opening of his word what he's doing right now how he's working to governments how he's working to political power how he's working to ecclesiastical power how he's working to religious power in all these things yes yes demon power political power religious power all coming together amen if that is all coming together what about the Bride of CHR what about the Body of Christ am what about the body foot frame together God gifts always find their places amen the Holy Ghost come down to positionally place you in the body amen it's the holy ghost that come down to to place you in this Homeland the homeland of the Holy Ghost just like Joshua placed them in the Homeland amen plac them in the inheritance the Holy Ghost is here to place us in our inhabitance to positionally place Us in this body and that's where you are blessed when you are positionally placed and you stay in your position that's where you'll receive your blessings amen amen so we find that in the book of uh when during the Daniel's time when the the 70 years was about to run out and Daniel began to pray and when did he pray he prayed at the evening time amen at the ending of the 70 years of captivity but who came down Gabriel came down but it wasn't it didn't just come down he was stopped by the Prince of Persia yes right but Michael come comes on the scene amen and makes a way for Gabriel to come Amen to explain to Daniel all these things amen right he came down to bring Revelation that was previously not revealed nobody knew these things but he comes and reveals it to Daniel Amen and this Revelation that he's giving to Daniel now is going to start the process amen of changing the dwelling place amen from captivity oh yes Lord to go back and rebuild Jerusalem amen amen that was going to the process by the angel coming down to Daniel and giving him this Revelation amen and we find that the same thing happened in this day when the when the prophet was there and he knew that he preached all these things and he tied up all the Loose Ends but he said of waiting for a message I I preach what Paul preached but now I'm waiting for a message amen and the Lord showed him the vision that this is what's going to happen and in the dream or Vision you had and you were those people were coming to the the municipality was coming to do some construction there at the roadside and he said when you see that sign it's time to go west remember when he was younger he said you'll always be successful in the west amen but the Lord was referring to this amen the greatest the capping of his ministry amen yes amen amen and we find that he goes in the west and we and remember he preaching 962 Serv is this the sign of the end yes the recorded message telling you yes what's going to unfold amen prior to it happening and yet the critics want to deny what happened but is recorded amen exactly what's going to happen amen and he's taking the scripture the exact scripture amen and then it happens because God interprets his word by making it come to pass yes amen amen amen and a scriptural Prophet must go back a prophet a script must go back to the word amen being a scriptural prophet he must go back to the word he must take it from the scripture amen he doesn't go by feelings and emotions must bring it back to the word amen line upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little amen amen and then he brings it back to the word and shows that now it's coming to the at the end of the seventh Church age coming to the end of the seventh Church age now the church was put out but now this is time now for God to bring a message not for the whole world but for his beloved bride amen for his elected lady yes amen and this message yeah where is it coming now it's coming at the end of the seven Church ages yes yes amen what is coming for this message is going to come to give you rapturing Faith amen it comes in a three-fold purpose to shout The Voice the Trump amen the shout is gathering amen what is the shout Thunders shouted out come to awaken you come to tell you who you really are come to show you that you're not no longer the son of child you are son and daughter of God comes to give you identification that you always was in the back part of God's mind that you're an eternal being am you never began in the first place you always was part of God am yes you're not like every other human being amen but you a spirit being trapped in a flesh body not a body with a spirit you a supernatural being trapped in a flesh body hallelujah amen you are in the image of God amen amen amen showing you that you are the Queen of Heaven amen you are the one that Earth was created for you yeah don't you know the righteous shall shall tread upon the ashes of the wicked that is you amen don't you know the Saints shall judge the earth that is you when you saw root in the Bible you began to see through the opening of the word this is you when you saw Esther there that is you amen Esther only could go to the inner courts yes amen and how how could she go through unicord he had to go through marriage he had to go through a union amen so how can you can go and dwell in the place where the sh of Glory comes in amen it comes through a union amen amen so we find that we're talking about this house now that's full with glory amen amen this house amen amen this Earthly Tabernacle Hallelujah this house of skin human flesh amen God veil in amen amen amen but you say look look at my FS look at my failes you think God looks at that then you're putting the blood of Jesus of n effect yes then you saying the blood had no effect you see when you walk in the light and he is the light when you walk in the light then the blood when you walk in the light that mean the word that's given to you in the hour in this hour amen amen when you walk in the light of the word amen then the blood has effect [Music] Hallelujah lots of people claim to have the blood Pentecostal and so forth but they're not walking in the light amen not to give effect to the blood amen you must walk in the light amen you must follow the scripture amen amen amen because in him there's no Darkness at all in God is light amen so there is a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost once again in dwelling in a people yes we saw the pattern in the book of we saw the former glory in the book of Acts amen but that was only the abstract that was only the down payments amen but there must be a changing of Dwelling Places amen things that are to be in my father's house are many mentions let's read that let say you put that quot up he says it was easy it was easy for those Jews who had been taught through generations yes to believe that there was a great Supernatural God put quote number two it was easy for the Jews who had been taught through generation to believe they were a great Supernatural God but to think that God had come down and was manifesting himself s to the person of his son Jesus Christ God tabernacled in a body of Flesh that was a little too much for them to understand but he said now as you believed in God believe also in me amen for in my father's house are many mansions and I go to prepare a place for you Jesus life was fixing to end here on Earth he had shown the people and proed to them that he was Jehovah manifested in flesh by the great signs and wonders and the reference of the Bible that he had referred to to himself and he proved that he was God manifested now he said when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose and I'm going away to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also G Jesus therefore is telling his disciples that his life is not ended in depths and we know at his Ascension is that the angel of God said to the disciple when you see him you shall be like him amen so we are promised that he's prepared a better body for us amen that we going to have a glorified body amen and you can't have a glorified body if you first didn't receive the Passover amen if you first didn't receive the sacrifice first you have to be identified with your sacrifice and then you have a Pentecost amen then you have the baptism of the the Holy Ghost amen and when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you receive the word for the day you are now going to change your dwelling place that's why the Holy Ghost is positionally placing you amen he's placing you in your place of your inhabitance because you have now going to change your Dwelling Places amen that's what the Feast of Tabernacle was about to change the dwelling place amen amen and we are going to change our dwelling place that's what this word has come to do it's a down payment show us it's the earnest of our inheritance it's a doubt showing us you got this it's a guarantee if you got this you pass from dead to life you are now going to have a body change amen you're going to change from Mortal to immortality you shall have a glorified body like him amen but how do you identify this how do you know that it's with you because you say this is the house that the Holy Ghost dwells in amen this house is the temple of God this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost why is it God is a ghost but what is what why is it an adjective word he's an Holy Ghost amen amen yes he's a spirit but a holy spirit yes he describing his nature amen describing the nature of the Holy Spirit and now he must come dwell in a holy people oh that's hard to digest now a holy people with all the false and failures no he looks at you sinless spotless Hallelujah amen prophesied over you that you are the sinless Spotless bride without blemish without spot without wrinkles you have not done it in the first place amen amen only people with the true atonement can say that amen because you have received your atonement Amen in the message the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride he says he says the Feast of the Tabernacle was the last Feast the seventh Feast so where it was it was the last Feast the seventh Feast it was also in the sorry me like it was the last seventh Feast but also if you look at it in the year it was in the seventh month and in the Jewish calendar that's the month of October right we are worshiping now under the Feast of Tabernacles the seventh Church age in the Millennium will'll be under the Feast of Tabernacles again in the seventh day amen but then after the seventh day we have a holy convocation go back into the Eternal how by the Eternal one that

bodies amen amen God has used us as his ages we are his agents on the earth if a man want to make an appointment with God he's going to see you yes if a man want to hear from God he's not going to look at a physical God coming to appear before him but he's looking at you when you are speaking to him when you are speaking to your colleagues when you are speaking to your friends your family your neighbors yes amen amen and you are speaking God's word that is God speaking to them amen yes when the preacher is preaching to you and he's giving you the revelation of God's word is not the preacher speaking it's God speaking to you through his word many people say I want to hear the audible voice of God God but God is speaking through his words God is speaking through his people amen amen but they are blinded amen that is why you need to it says we need to come up higher we need to have the mind of Christ Hallelujah we need but now we are seated in Heavenly places we can see these things we can see that when when we first from the days we first received the message we can see there a progression in the word we can see that now God is working with his body there was the time we were keep looking back and say in the days of William Bram in the days of the Prophet yes we appreciate those days and we appreciate those testimonies but there must be these happenings amongst you and I there must be the God that was with William brandham is now Chang his Dwelling Place the same son of man there a dwelling in a son of man amen is not dwelling in a many membered body doing the greater work why is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's the same God that can eal the sick he's the same God that can raise the dead he's the same God that can make the blind to see he's the same God that can deliver the oppressed he's the same God that can chase those demons away amen amen and is the same God that is here today that is giving us rapturing Faith amen he's come to give us a word that will change his body amen amen amen amen that is why we need to that's why the message came on Sunday on Wednesday we need to change our position amen amen you need to change from your former State the state where you are too involved in your human Affairs yeah too involved in your caral thinking to involved with your intellectual mind and come and see the things of God the way the

changing their position yes amen when Jonah Tri to run away God had to send a a whale there to get him because why that that way he was wasn't the right place God wanted him God had to divert and change his position for him to come to his ministry amen amen when Joseph saw the dream amen that place where he was wasn't going to fulfill the dream God had to take him on a journey to change his position am and you might have went to your sufferings you might have went to your heartbe but God was doing that to shape you to mold you so you can shape your position amen amen thank you Lord thank you Lord because why you in an adoption age that's why you having the Holy Ghost furing you amen taking you to the training grounds making you a mature son and daughter of God so you can overcome the

of God I can go and ask them amen amen when you ask them they say I give to you amen amen amen the word is showing us who we are the word is showing us the glory that we're coming to amen because no

rapturing condition you know healing and all these things those are signs that what we are waiting for we with the Redemption of our body the soul is been redeemed amen but the Final Redemption is when this body finally restored back to our original condition amen corruption must put on incorruption morality must put on immortality amen but remember although this body is in a raptured condition because of the word that we have received and The Awakening of the word it's still under a law of sin he's subject to the law of nature of this life because of what happened there but we can say through the holy ghost that is dwelling in us we have a guides am we have leadership saying us no you said the wrong thing yeah yeah correct that put that right you spoken to Ashley to your brother
