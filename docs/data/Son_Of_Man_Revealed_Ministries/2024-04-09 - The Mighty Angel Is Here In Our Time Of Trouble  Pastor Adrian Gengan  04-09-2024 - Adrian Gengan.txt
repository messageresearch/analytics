I pray you'll meet them at the point of their need Lord Jesus speak to our very Hearts oh God and I pray Lord that you'll anoint your word oh God anoint the hearer of the word oh God I pray in the mighty name of Jesus amen hallelujah amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christen amen of whom the world is not worthy amen the world is not worthy of our Lord and savior and I pray that you had a blessed day today amen everybody had a blessed day and I pray you'll have even blessed evening tonight amen hallelujah amen amen so we'll turn to Psalm 46 Psalm 46 says God is our refuge and strength amen God is our refuge and strength amen I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength amen so God is our refuge and strength a very present help in TR in the time of trouble a very present help in the time of trouble amen so the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated I'd like to speak a little thought amen the mighty Angel is here in our time of trouble amen amen amen the mighty Angel is here in our time of trouble and when I say he is here I mean he is here amen amen that's not a guess work I stand here under the authority of the word of God to declare that he is here amen amen hallelujah just as the prophet under his anointing could declare that he is here oh yes amen because the bride can't move without th say the Lord so we got to have him here amen so to say that the Lord is our strength our refuge and our strength that is a powerful declaration in the midst of our time of trouble to be able to remain in a same mind and declare that the Lord is my refuge and my strength most times when we find ourselves in trouble panic panic sets in fear grips the heart amen maybe minor sicknesses come upon us and we don't react that way but let an arct come let's get a cancer report and see if we can remain in a present State of Mind to know that God is here that God is in control of all things so a powerful declaration to be made by sons and daughters of God that God is our refuge amen amen God is our strength am we know that strength is is virtue power amen hallelujah and he's a very present help in the time of trouble but it has to become a living reality not just a scripture memory verse amen do we become overwhelmed by the situations in our lives no matter what we are facing whatever roles we are playing whatever situation we encounter day to day do we become overwhelmed by what we encountering or is there a settled peace in our hearts to know God is in control am God has got this amen I can rest in his unfailing arms knowing you will never let me down amen what do we Panic fear stress have anxiety attacks start throwing Tantrums start screaming yes amen what am I saying handle the situation amen you're a God over your [Music] situation so we see we will see how the Lord's Redemptive names redeemed amen Reveals His unwavering presence and help in our times of need now the word refuge we know is a is a place of safety it's a place of shelter Hallelujah and God is described as being our refuge when we don't know when to turn we need to think of a refuge amen a place that we can go to our hiding place that we can find protection yes amen we can find protection from the danger we we think of the Israelites and The Refuge was in the presence of God when they were escaping the Egyptian chariots and they were navigating through the Wilderness their Refuge was God amen amen and just as God became the Refuge for Israel so you know that the Angel of the Lord went before them and now you went behind them to form a shield between them and the Egyptian Army so he is before us and he's behind us he surrounds us with his presence amen hallelujah so he is our refuge our secure place praise the Lord so when we are feeling overwhelmed by the storms of life whether it be physical emotional spiritual we can find safety and rest in him amen hallelujah now we find in Proverbs 18:10 it says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run to it and are safe amen and I pray amen we make use of the tower amen I pray amen that that becomes our Fortress a strong tower amen I'm reminded of the story now of the Prophet talking about a storm the storms of life brother Bram took his wife hope and Billy Paul for a little holiday he didn't have much money so he took get into the Wilderness for hunting trip amen perfect holiday and it happened to be storming that day so he left them in a tent and his wife says I'm going to prepare supper don't be long but he goes out into the mountain you know about Hurricane Mountain if you type up Hurricane Mountain you'll probably find a lot of quotes regarding this and the prophet goes into the mountains and a storm comes his way a blizzard that he can't see fog all around he can't find his way back to camp and as is is he's thinking I'm a good an I'm a witsman I'll find my way back until he came to a point he says over him you could hear a voice I'm a very present help in the time of trouble amen but he wasn't paying attention to the voice at first because he was depending upon his own self on what he could do what he could achieve yes sometimes God's going to take that ability away from you or he's going to set the target so high that you can't reach it then you're going to have to depend on him especially in these times especially in these economies amen you're going to have to depend on him amen don't be secure in our own self recognize that God is our source he is our amen so the prophet comes and then he says I just had to surrender to the Lord and I said Lord I'm no good answer I'm no good wisman Lord why don't you come and help me hallelujah amen and the prophet of God says he began to pray and he asked the Lord for his help and he says that as he was marching he realized he says some fog began to clear and he caught sight of Hurricane m amen and all he did was reposition himself he was actually going the wrong way he repositioned himself and he said as long as he had sight of that mountain he just marched straight that way amen so what we saying is keep your eyes fixed on Christ don't focus on the world just keep marching amen and then he says I had my hands raised up because he said there was a telephone wire from the top of the mountain all the way down to camp and he said oh if I could only somehow get the telephone wire I know it would lead me to my destination so he says he was had his hands in his air and he's marching and he's walking and he's trus in the Lord that somehow he'll connect with his wire am with his unseen force with his Heavenly realm amen and then he said all at once he cut a hold of that wire get a hold of the Holy Ghost amen it'll lead you to your destination amen hallelujah if we want to start right in this life we've got to to connect with the Holy Ghost we've got to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen if you don't have food that's okay if you don't have a house that's okay if you don't have a car that's okay but make sure you have the Holy Ghost amen amen it's a must it's a requirement for this life praise the Lord so the prophet found his way back to Camp because he got a hold of the wire and the scripture the lord gave him is I am a present help in the time of trouble amen so we find that he says there I a present help in the time of trouble amen is our refuge and strength so in addition to being Refuge is our strength now strength is referring to power is our power is our source of power amen is our support that enables us to to face life's challenges life's obstacles when we feel weak and unable to handle our struggles God becomes our strength God becomes our former support am amen and it's in our weakness he says his strength become amen his strength is made perfect amen Isaiah 4029 says he gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak amen so when we are facing challenges if you could not go on it's in those moments you've got to depend on God's strength I'm going through the basics of the scripture first before we hit the Nugget of this amen so the phrase a present help shows us a God who is there immediately and he doesn't say a present help he says he's a very present help amen our God is very present amen God knows went to respond immediately and went to wait Daniel needed an answer from the Lord but his response his answer was sent Angels but when the three Hebrew boys in the midst of their trial in the midst of their trouble God immediately responded amen yes Lord amen so God's presence is not distant he's an everpresent reality in our Darkness moments when we feel lost when we feel alone he is right there with us ready to intervene ready to assist he is here to help us amen but can we recognize he's here now do we want to get him involved in our school do we want God to be involved in our work do we want God to be involved in our home life we must realize he's ever present amen amen if we're just looking very quickly at the names Redemptive names of Jehovah Jehovah Gyra means he's our provider amen Jehovah Rafa means he's our healer Jehovah ni means he's our Banner Jehovah Shalom he's our peace Jehovah siku our righteousness Jehovah sh is our present he's present this reveals the fullness of his provision and presence now watch every one of those names requires him to be present so sha becomes the Central Point his presence now we know that there's the angel of his presence Hallelujah so these are just not titles just not they are Declarations of his nature and his his his character regarding his promises so when he says is's Jehovah Gyra he's promising to provide when he says he's Jehovah Rafa he's promising to heal but these names assure us of his constant presence sha must be there to provide sha must be there to heal sha must be there amen as our Banner sha must be there as our peace amen praise the Lord so if maybe you're going through a financial difficulty you got Jehovah Gyra amen say Lord you promised you are my provider amen he reminds you of his promises that he's going to meet your need if you're facing heess Jehovah Rafa is here the Lord who heals he assures you of his healing power you know I was reading the prophet and he was telling us about this uh two men Richard Blair if you want to pick up some highlights on this it's in uh 1965 trying to do God's service without being his will but I'll just illustrate it or or paraphrase it and you can pick up there amen it's from paragraph 11 so the Brother Richard Blair wrote brother brand him a letter and they were they were dealing with Australia and they were hooking up an electrical wire to it but somehow the trailer with the electrical wire went into the water and there was a little boy swimming in the water water and the boy got electrocuted to [Music] death right it's uh 65078 so it killed a boy and he swelled out like his stomach swelled out he says when they die you know that happens the little eyes set the teeth went together and brother Blair thought I better get old of brother Brandon right he said I better get a hold of brother Brandon now I'm trying to think now in a situation like this imagine you at the scene the person is electrocuted to death what would we do we say he's gone he's finished but look at the brother's present State of Mind can I get to the man of God am amen right but I'm trying to show even more powerful testimony that brother brandham had nothing to do with it okay he just thought of brother brandham but he knew he couldn't get to brother Brandon okay did you get it amen let's read from paragraph 12 then it says it alarmed the Brethren so bad brother BL said he thought he could get a hold of me somewhere to pray for it but remember that it was that his mind went to scripture yes amen wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I am sha amen amen I am a present help yes right and the father skinned his te fingers trying to get his fingers into the boy's mouth to break it open the boy is dead right and they knelled down and started praying over the little boy and he came back to life again amen this is equally as powerful as at's testimony these people brought a dead boy back to life why they remember the scripture they remember the word yes they took the word to the Mind amen so he says what what is that true brother Blair one of our loyal Brothers here the little boy is here see the boy is now in the service the little boy is here he says well thank the Lord that's fine we'd like for you to stand up sunny boy now we thank the dear Lord for this our God is able to do anything he promised it we are living in the divine presence of the great glorious Heavenly Father amen and all things are possible if we can just believe it you see what it does what it paid for that man's life to believe that saved his little boy amen so what am I trying to show you don't panic in the midst of your trouble in the midst of your trial have present State of Mind know that you are son and daughter of godall don't quick to call the Undertaker amen now let's get to some of the message now remember what he's saying he's our refuge and strength in the time of trouble I am saying the mighty Angel is here in our time of trouble amen so what is our time of trouble amen we find here in the message exposition of the seven Church ages brother Bram is reading Revelation 3:11 and he says behold I come quickly that he's talking about the second coming now hold that all that fast to which thou Hast that no man take thy Crown he says we don't need to comment on the thought that he's coming quickly we know that he is because we are in the end of the last days do you believe that amen he says oh fast to what you have that no man take your crown he says it is in the midst of the time of trouble that Jesus comes amen not talking about coming out to your individual needs he's talking about his second coming meaning that there is a time of trouble coming upon the [Music] people when all the foros W is on the Earth all of hell is let loose war council of churches are formed religions are formed political powers are formed demon powers are here a time of trouble he says that's when Jesus comes and when is coming there is a resurrection that's amen many are to come forth Out of the Dust and rise with those who are alive but waiting for his return amen yes don't worry brother Caleb your granny's got to come to this church for the resurrection she's got to be gathered with her people Pastor Ronnie's got to come back here Sean's got to come back here sister Maggi sister Chinta brother dicki all our loved ones have gone before Hallelujah am in other words all that the p k Locus and caterpillar have eaten I will restore say the Lord amen hallelujah Psalm 27 and verse 5 now watch what he said he just said Jesus comes at the time of trouble brother Brandon picks up this message the scripture in the Rapture message and he takes Psalm 27 he says for in the time of trouble in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his civilian amen is he our refuge so he's going to hide Us in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock amen amen yes so we are right now in the time of trouble 200 million demons have been let loose upon the Earth he says under melini akman and itler okay he says under there but I declare under this four under this fourth seal it says all of Hell Followed him all of Hell Followed him the rider on the horse go read that meaning hell is emptied out upon the Earth okay my point is now in the time of trouble is going to be our refuge and strength we just showed you brother gram saying in the time of trouble Jesus comes I'm tying it with Psalm 27:5 the the Bible says for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion shall give me a refuge now the Apostle Paul in in Acts 27:23 there if you mark this down we can read from 22 if you want he was in a time of trouble he was about to be Shipwrecked yes amen well maybe we won't go into that now maybe I I'll I'll just talk about it just now let's go to The Sixth Seal while we're talking about this time of trouble we find here brother Bram is typing Jacob in The Sixth Seal and he says we find now that Israel in that time of trouble when he was Jacob he wrestled with the he says he got a hold of something that was real there was a man come down Jacob got his arms around him and he stayed there the fellow said I must be going now it's coming daylight oh the breaking of the day it's fixing to come day but Jacob said I'm not going to leave you I'm going to stay right with you I want things changed here amen right if you want to read the account it's in it's in Genesis 3 32:4 now I noted that it was verse 24 that Jacob was left alone he's now going to meet Esau brother brandham calls this time of him leaving laan and meeting Esau the time of trouble it at this time he meets the angel of the Lord amen amen I I pray you're picture painting a broader picture yes amen it's in the time of trouble that Jacob meets the angel of the Lord but he's left alone in a time of solitude so who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord one who's in the form of a priest who has Clean Hands and a pure heart it's a time of consecration amen he says Jacob was left alone and they wrestled with the man with him until the breaking of day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint and he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day break it and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me amen we need to become so amen hallelujah what what's the word desate not desperate amen it's like that's my position I'm King and I want to ascend to that well persevere maybe that's a better word brother rames what's the next word I need to become so Anointed with my position amen I need to become so amen that that thought needs to take over me that that's my position and I want to have it amen so can we wrestle with the angel now to bear in mind he's physically wrestling this is not a dream yes this is not a vision amen he sees the angel of the Lord and he wrestles with the angel of the Lord amen can we wrestle with him in our time of trouble yes maybe you're thinking what am I talking about time of trouble I have enough food at home I have I have a good job I can take care of my needs I can take care of my bills Church in the spiritual realm this is a time of trouble yes amen the writer is riding Amen in the spiritual realm amen demonic forces upon the Earth fixing now for the final showdown we are almost at the end a waked ourselves amen amen let's awaken out of Slumber yes Lord let's not get comfortable in latery conditions oh yes Lord we've got to awaken to the spiritual sense the spiritual realm to realize the time is at hand amen I not maybe brother what I'm trying to say I not satisfied in my current condition yes amen yes Jacob was saying I am not satisfied with all the blessings he had just left lean's house and if you go read what he left with he was Extremely Blessed he had need of nothing that's right except he needed an encounter with the angel of Goden and I'm saying the mighty Angel is here in our time of trouble but can we go and connect with the angel of God lord yes Lord amen that's the word that's what I'm trying to say I am not satisfied in my current condition The Cry of my heart is Lord I want to be in my ought to be conditioned amen that's the Cry of my heart yes Lord I want to be back in my heart to be conditioned I want to be a fully redeemed son and daughter of God Amen that's right I'm not satisfied with temporal blessings I want my inheritance amen that's it hallelujah praise the Lord amen now watch he can't change him and he can't give him something and the goes straight to the root of it meaning he goes to the scene seed he goes to the genetic of it he says and the angel ask him what is your name a name represents your character and your nature what is your jeene seed and he said Jacob he says the name th name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel amen for as a prince H has thou power with God Amen and you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you oh amen he gave you power to become a Son of God amen amen this is an adoption ceremony taking him before Angels amen and giving him his name amen Israel Prince with God Amen thou has power with God and with men and H has prevailed Hallelujah if I read Revelation 5 there was one who prevailed it was the Lord Jesus Christ to take the book but on the earth his wife has got to Prevail to be able to take the book Hallelujah as he is so is she if he Prevail so must he she so she prevails to take the book praise the Lord the Lord amen she must Prevail to take the book and he says so he changes his name changes his identity is what I'm trying to tell you that people who thought of you they KN maybe they were Your Best Body in school after you born again after you an adopted son you are not the same person to be identified with amen they can't say hey let's go back and have a good old day what are you talking about amen you don't know me I've had a name change I've had a nature change and he says amen and he prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou Dost ask after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of that place pineal for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved and as he passed over pineal the sun rose upon him and he altered up his thigh therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinu which shrank which is upon the Hallow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in The Sinner that shrank so Jacob walked in new walk I'm saying we are in our new walk now we are in our new walk amen amen it's called an Enoch walk we are in our new walk now why we've been touched by the angel hey I'm not speaking something foreign I'm saying we are physically met the angel and we have been touched by the angel so our walk is different our talk is different so now when we go to meet Esau it's no more Jacob coming to meet Esau it's a new man coming to meet Esau he's a Victor he's an overcomer that even Esau can't be angry with his brother anymore because this is a new man this man has met the angel the angel came in the time of trouble and delivered him oh thank you Hallelujah Daniel chter 12 very quickly now we're going to close now amen you know it's our prayer night meeting amen and at that time shall Michael stand who's Michael somebody tell me an angel he's an archangel he's a mighty Angel Michael shall stand up the great Prince which standed for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of what a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in what the book brother Jeff what is that who's got that book hello which means there need to be a transfer of Revelation because as taking the book means we have the Revelation yes sir there needs to be a transfer and impartation from us going off to those next two meaning a transfer from Revelation 10 to Revelation 11 and who's going to provide that transfer the angel himself praise the Lord so you see they without us cannot be made perfect too we've got to leave in order for them to be get their redeemer back that's right they will not see Jesus I'm talking the 144,000 will not see Jesus till we go yes amen so you can see everything is fixed around us six Dimension Saints around us 144,000 Jews around us they're all saying hey guys please go from here and even we grown within ourselves amen longing for the changing of the body so we are the key players now how many of you like to be the key player you hold the Trum card hey you know the trump card is around praise the Lord so he says here this is Bible now right everyone whose name is written in the book we know who has the book right now yes and we are calling the names that are in the book we're not calling the Jewish names we are calling the Gentile names am in our time of Prophecy watch the scripture is very powerful and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake talking about the what the resurrection shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn to righteousness as stars forever and ever but thou Daniel shut up the words and seal the book but thou bride unseal the book amen Daniel you shut it up it's not for you right unsealed amen unsealed Revelation unsealed Mysteries amen because why he says leave it for the time of the end and are we at the End Amen right many shall run to and from and knowledge shall be increased now I don't want to read what the prophet is saying because I pretty much explained it when I read the scripture amen so we can skip that quote brother amen now the prophet is saying here in in The Sixth Seal you can put it up from maybe verse paragraph 24 278 there right so brother Bram is reading Daniel 12 what we just read and now he says now compare that exactly what Jesus said Matthew 24 there shall be a time of trouble has never been since there was a nation right right so he's tying that now with Matthew 24 talking about a time of trouble you see that's written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall be delivered at that time and many of those that slept in the dust of the Earth shall awaken right and if you read Matthew 24 it says there shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be and except those days be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elect sake those days shall be shortened so if you're thinking time is just going on and on God shortening the days in just once more Lord he says this Jezebel system now spiritually now blind spiritually to the word of God joining themselves right into the Council of churches our great in Evangelical teaching we have to Forfeit that to be an organization all organization that isn't n in the Council of churches I got the paper on it that even if your church is not in the Council of churches in the time of trouble they can use your church as a to store ammunition or anything they want and if any man is caught having a prayer for anybody outside of affiliating with this Council of churches can be shot as a federal offense that's right I got the papers on it from Washington they're going to force you into it that's why I've been against this organizational system I had to keep it quiet about it being the mark of the [Music] beast but it's late enough now till you can know it's the truth amen let's read acts 27:22 and we can close now I'm just trying to show you that we are in our time of trouble but the mighty Angel has coming I don't need to elaborate on the mighty Angel right now we've preached on it through the years you know what he's here for you know that we have connected with this Angelic realm amen praise the Lord so Paul is on his way to Rome to see Caesar and there's a ship that's being wrecked they caught in a storm and Acts 27:22 says and now I exalt you to be of good cheer in the midst of your storm in the midst of your shipwreck everpresent help there shall be no loss of any man's life among you now what I'm trying to show you in in the midst of other people's crisis too can you be the voice of calm yes yes can you be the voice of comfort meaning can you be Jehovah Shalom to them can you be their peace can you be their comfort or do you join hey terrible eh never seen it so bad how you going to manage I wish you good luck no Comfort no word we need to go to the word to bring Comfort to them amen your business doing bad tell them God is our refuge and our strength a very present help in the time of trouble they might ask you what do you mean the time of trouble can't you see how bad the business is it's a time of trouble but God is our refuge and our strength amen you see a businessman he finds it hard to pull God into his business because all he can see is dollars yeah yeah he can see Rams Rams are like strands amen all he can see is RS all he can see is that if I don't have control over this deal I'm not going to get it so I need to bribe somebody I need to do this to get the deal no Lord you are my source yes amen father

present in my business so Lord by Divine attraction bring customers to this business yes amen so that I can have a job and have sustenance amen he's our provider now we can't approach your prayers will never work if you approach God in panic and fear and anxiety and stress oh Lord I don't know what I'm going to do Lord I don't know what I'm going to do oh Father please come no God don't work like that you've got to empty out Lord I'm not in control of this situation I can't handle that situation I'm inviting you to come and take control of the situation amen God doesn't respond to your begging God doesn't respond to you crying God doesn't respond to those things God responds to Faith amen amen amen that's why Jesus said there if you come with the mountain and you cry and you break coconut and you fast seven days what did Jesus say speak and believe your word hallelujah you know that's the hardest thing to do in the midst of Crisis trial sickness speak and believe the word the word Will Conquer anything let's close now with this so be be the voice of comfort there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of God
