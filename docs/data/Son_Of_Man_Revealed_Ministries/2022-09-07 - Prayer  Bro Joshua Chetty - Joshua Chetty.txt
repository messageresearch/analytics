privileged to in found house of god tonight amen we thank god for your supernatural lands and answered prayers amen that we could have now another lamb added to the flock amen amen we know the whole event was supernatural it was the hand of god yes and today is also another special day we have shekinah's birthday being two years old amen she's no longer the youngest now so god has been adding amen and we pray for the grace of god actually this morning started off as good and bad morning we had to lose one of our pets it was actually something that was given by my late brother and we got the news early in the morning so it didn't start off as a good day but because god is in control of all things amen circumstances and uh we pray that the grace of god will continue to keep us amen yes amen amen we've got our bibles we'll turn to the book of james the book of james chapter five reading from verse 16. confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that jay may be healed amen amen confess your fault one to another and pray one for another the j may be healed the fictional fervent prayer he's not just asking for any type of prayer the effectual fervent prayer not just of anybody but of a righteous man yeah a veiled amen amen elias was a man subject to like passion that we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months so he didn't pray absolutely right he didn't just go and say this must happen he prayed earnestly yes because he could understand the time and season that he was living in and he knew that the divine promise that was pertaining to him amen yes and he knew his position in god he didn't just go and pray without knowing his position he knew he was a prophet of god he was a man sin from god and standing under that position and authority he prayed earnestly amen but yet he was a man like passion as we are yes an ordinary man from the outside yeah but his prayer gonna tap into the supernatural amen amen through his prayer he's gonna be living into another dimension amen because it's gonna grant him access to that dimension amen amen and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again amen and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth a fruit amen amen you may be seated we thank god for the reading of his word we're gonna speak speak tonight on prayer being the inherent requirement of the believer prayer we know that as a christian you must read your bible and pray every day but we're talking about prayer being an inheritance requirement that means a believer cannot do without it it is essential yes yes you cannot walk the spiritual journey without a life of prayer jesus being on the earth 2000 years ago before the start of his ministry had to go and and go alone into the desert for a time of prayer a time of communion because why as much he was living in this world he had to tap back into the dimension where he come from daniel before you go and find out what's going to happen to the end time you have to go in a time of fasting and prayer amen abraham when he had the experience of god and god god went there and told him what's going to happen to sodom and gomorrah he went into a time of prayer amen an intercessory role yes amen he didn't just you see sometimes desperation will put us in an intercessory role but there's different needs and there's different circumstances in prayer we might come tonight and we're all praying and asking god for a certain thing in our life yes good that's needed yeah but when you come to understand the real plan of god in your life and where you fit into the body yes it's no longer just spring for your necessity which is normal which is your normal christian praying and reading your bible yes right but we're talking about a different type of prayer we're talking about a prayer when a man understands his position in christ amen we're talking a prayer to a man where the third pool has been the opening of the word has come to him yes where the seals have been unlocked to him amen and he understands the time he's living in the hour that he's living in and he's not praying like every other believer should pray it's just more than that yeah amen [Music] jesus a illustration one time in mark 9 27 when he was casting out the spirit this demon he said but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he rose and when he was coming to the house his disciples asked him privately why could not we cast him out yes and he said unto them this kind come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting yes now they were there with jesus now jesus was showing them an example that these this you must also gonna you're also going to be doing you're also going to be living this life of prayer amen because when you come into the life of prayer you're going to tap into another dimension amen and then you're going to see these spirits because your prayer life in through prayer you're going to be contacting all these spirits because the bible says we rest a lot against flesh and blood amen so you at your workplace you got your mates fighting with you coming your boss is coming down in you sometimes you don't realize that we wrestle a lot again flesh and blood yes maybe after a lovely revival meeting on a sunday the world was so nice and then you have your monday morning blues because those demons can't stand you're rejoicing from within you something taking place within you that demons are contacting that spirit within you amen do you see what i'm saying you a person now who is not living that prayer for life will not be able to identify with these things so jesus is saying to them and he said under that this kind come forth by nothing but by fasting and prayer amen amen he says in one of his quotes he says in the message spiritual food in due season he says but he embodies himself taking your body and my body and gives you gifts gives me gifts and through these gifts he makes himself known amen amen so if god embodies himself look what he says now but but the the devil he said one time jesus cast out some demons out of a man from kedara and he went into the herd of swine is that right he said demons are powerless unless they embody it so they need to be embodied too from their dimension they tapping into this dimension to embody human beings so why can't we from this dimension tap into the other dimension into the supernatural so christ can his spirit can embody us and use us because demons i am budding people yes otherwise they are useless they are powerless now if they are doing that how much more we need to emtap into the other dimension amen and what is our access to that to prayer amen we heard the message the other week about the sixth sense by faith amen because it was revealed to us yes it was by divine revelation amen we know that we chapting to the sixth dimension to that sixth sense yes amen and now what what exists are we using our communication to prayer right amen matthew six verse five says when the prayers thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are amen yes oh you know the hypocrites how they love to go amongst the politicians and come come amongst all these big dignitaries and have all the other faith groups they call it and come together and calling themselves christians for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corner of the streets that they might be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou and dark prayers enter into thy closets amen amen you see this prayer now is gonna be between you and god amen this prayerful life i'm talking about is when you are separating yourself from the things of this world when you are separating yourself from the five senses yes you are separating yourself from this dimension which is full now with demon power and when thou were shut thy door see it becomes a lifestyle prayer becomes your lifestyle yeah pray to thy father which is in secrets and thy father would see it in secret shall reward amen you don't have to go and show everybody how you're praying show everybody i pray for the sick i'm do this and go and pray in the secret amen amen and what you do in secret you will see it happen in you'll have your testimonies come out and open your head and the brother said this this happened to me but you know in secret your spring amen the brothers say i got this job but you know he was praying for his brother you had a concern for his brother [Music] or amen come you have a lovely meeting under the service but you know during the day before the service you were praying amen you didn't tell everybody about your spread but your spring yes yes and you know what i'm talking about only if you know what i'm talking about where you had those secret prayers you're just praying sometimes somebody comes in your mind but you know god the holy spirit sometimes you're led by the spirit of god and holy spirit brings a person in your thoughts and you start to pray for them i suddenly say i was in this situation but thank god i've been delivered from this amen sometimes you've got to be sensitive to the leading of the spirit amen amen but when you pray use not weighing repetitions you don't ask us to use high words and uh go and quote the scriptures and everything when you pray yeah it's a communication between you and your father amen amen between christ and his church yes yes between the wife and the husband this is a love affair prayer is your open door of communication don't just go to god and say i want this i want our want or once lord give me this give me that give me this give me this amen amen don't run it like how you run your country here a social welfare country but that's what our country is about the social welfare country this is a love relationship yes can you imagine you know you're when you're cutting a or you have your husband and wife situation or even before you get married you're courting and every time your girlfriend comes to you or your wife comes to you and say i want i want her one we're not coming and complimenting you without coming and giving some good words to you and you're just demanding from you now we know that concubines do those things but our wife wants to rent a service now we got to go and praise him we got to worship him we're going to exalt him we [Music] she wanted him she was in love with she was in love with the king she just wanted him amen oh why don't you want to be one say i just want to see him i just want to embrace him i mean think about what a communication that is now because prayer is communication now imagine when you go by someone and keep demanding things now god understand your needs trust me you want to meet with your needs are we talking about your attitude yes in the way you're approaching amen and you'll know when you have that loved one no matter what she is asking you but she'll come to the right attitude and that beautiful female characteristics you can never say no to it amen ask any father when the daughters come to them so you know what i'm talking about amen now can you imagine when you approach god it's the same thing amen you'll be saying we love him we're saying we are safe from what he's done let's let's be honest to ourselves are we just saying lord bless our need give me this give me that give me that well those things you do in your morning prayer you don't have to but it's the in-between prayer you don't want to talk about the in-between prayer your communication with him all the time amen so he says use not vain repeat repetitions as the edens do for they think that they shall be heard or they're much speaking [Music] be not ye therefore like unto them for your father know what what things you have need of before you ask him amen after this manner therefore pray he our father which chat in heaven hallowed be thy name so there's a reverence amen to our lord amen yes we don't just take his name in vain we don't just call out his name in vain because even the demons recognize that name yes but but christians don't know the power of the name amen and we just use that name and we watch people cursing that name we watch it in the tv and everything people cursing the name of jesus and we take it anyhow yes but even demons are terrified of amen amen [Music] i was speaking to someone the other night and he was telling me they had an encounter with a demon spirit and the only thing this person eventually could say i am a son of god and that's what he said the demon left so even demons are terrified but people take the name of jesus without reverencing his name yes so your attitude in your prayer must be one out of respect to him and recognizing the recognizing the lord god almighty amen whom you are approaching we are privileged because of the blood of jesus we have access yes if it wasn't for them to remember i praised going in for you with your petitions amen and because of him we can cry out abba father amen he said thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven amen you see what that is he's already showing you that you this prayer is a person who recognized the entire seals book the entire book from genesis to revelation in other words this person understands redemption amen because it must be done in earth as it is in heaven this earth need to be reformed he needs to come and rule and reign on this earth because now it is the god of his evil age it saved his kingdom give it to him temporarily give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors amen you cannot pray or go into prayer with unforgiveness yes if you are only bitterness you're in strife yes or you ever unforgiving heart you cannot go to your god and pray you are wasting your time go and correct the error yes and lead us not into interpretation but deliver us from evil aren't we grateful amen amen that we we know that we're living in the space house but we are god is able to deliver us from evil amen because we have the holy spirit that is leading us amen amen and the minute you go down the wrong path he's going to bring conviction yes remember the prophet of god in his ministry you have to have every time he wants to go down the wrong path for a single day try and do something against the word of god when you file his body in any way what happens the angel of god was there we are given the holy ghost sin same thing right every child of god might be there every son the daughter is gonna let by the spirit of god amen but we've got to be sensitive now if you don't have that prayer for life how are you going to be sensitive to the leading of the spirit amen because you're only trapping natural things yes if you're not not in your spiritual diet yes that means you're not tapping the supernatural right so you are so used to the earthly thing you're so used to your senses that you're not sensitive with a spirit is speaking try to warn you or something so take heed to the leading of the holy spirit for this is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you it's a simple theory amen for if you forgive not mend their trespasses neither would your father forgive your so if you want to live a life where you don't have forgiveness from god and you want to go to him and ask him for this and that and you want your needs to be met but you don't want to forgive your brother yeah then go back and ask yourself do i also want god not to remember my prayers the prophet of god said prayer changes sickness to health amen hallelujah change your sinners to sins yes how many of you got a loved one that you that you know that he's a sinner that's god gone down the wrong road go on your knees yes yes go and claim them it's never too late amen it changes sinners to sins it's prayer he says you may laugh too much yes you may shout too much amen you may eat too much but you'll never pray too much and i will be true that is amen because any time you want to pray anytime you want to separate yourself from god what happened the devil knows that and he hinders that prayer life watch how the devil comes and heals your prayer life because remember as soon as you go into that in that zone of prayer to pray temptation comes what happened to jesus in the wilderness temptation came so god yourself amen amen i would that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands so you'll never be able to pray too much he says look at hezekiah when the prophet went up and said all right izakaya you're not coming off the bed it was pronounced to him god's done said you were going to die right there and where you reach imagine now i did they knew when the prophet of god speaks he's trusting the lord and the prophet of god death upon him and as a kaya studied it over if he just add 15 years longer see so he's looking at he said you know what this was my life that is pronounced upon me but if i can just have this time i can sort out a few things yes i can put my life in order hallelujah the things that i need to sort out in my life for my family and for us for the kingdom of god that i have here i can sort it out yes this is about the time i need sometimes you are put in a desperation you are put with a sickness you are put in a financial constraint yes something something's not working out your way put you in a time of desperation amen where are you going to complete your case to god yes and you have your interest yesterday yes amen and you know you can complete your case you know that because that's what the word says amen but you can't just go there and just want something because see what he says here you've got to give god a cause a reason now he didn't say just because i can get out there and ride around in a chariot and show the people i'm a king no he wanted to rebuild the altars of the god and a few things have to be done to get the kingdom in order right amen you see so he wasn't just gonna bargain for his life now just so he can just carry on just living and just enjoying life no you wanted to do a few things yes in other words like how the bible said seek first the kingdom of god and is righteousness then all these things shall be added unto you amen and he prayed that god would give him 15 years longer and he wept bitterly amen amen they affect your fervent prayer yes amen just went to god he said god i beseech you to consider me yes i have walked before you with a perfect heart what we said so before you go to enquire or to go your petition make yourself that righteous man come under the blood amen amen go with repentance amen god and repent with us yes amen and the bible says he is faithful and just to forgive us amen how many of us can say that tonight we walk before him with a perfect heart amen i walked before the lord with a perfect heart and i asked you to consider me amen and god almighty jehovah reconsidered that man's case because he prayed amen amen a prophet of god coming with the word of god yes a prophet is never wrong and he pronounced death upon him by this man's heart a man with an upright with a perfect heart [Music] a man that would effective prayer can go and weep bitterly before god can move the hand of god amen [Music] but he had a just cause he didn't just go and said lord i want just to be healed lord if you can give me this better job i can do better things i can help others i can help people i can do things again lord if you can just heal me of my sickness i can go out and be a witness for you don't make it selfish about yourself amen what i said in the first place this is not the prayer where you're coming we all are here we all got needs and we all pray for the needs but this is the type of prayer where you recognize yourself in the kingdom of god you see this king he prayed for the kingdom he taught things out in the kingdom so when you want something from god is because you must be kingdom minded amen yes amen don't be selfish you are your own personal family [Music] god will be kingdom minded because we are part of a body hallelujah we are part of a body of believers which is a mystical body of christ amen you've got to see the bigger picture amen you've got to recognize your position in christ amen you've got to recognize the authority behind that prayer amen [Music] and god almighty jehovah reconsidered that man's case because he prayed think of that almighty god that had pronounced dead upon the man reconsidered this case my that's too much for me the property saying this drink jehovah to immortal to one of the earth would reconsider his word what he said to him how much will he do it to us if he did it under the blood of bull and goats how much would he do it for us amen to the bride of jesus christ the one who's taken his name in this hour amen amen the one who the one who when people reject it there mocked it there and she said no i will go and bear the cross with jesus amen i will take up my cross and follow him though they scorn at me though they mock at me i will choose signs with jesus amen now god is all as ways of doing things look like he would have spoke right back and told him but i considered your case again i'm going to let you stay for that if you do that but he didn't he spoke to the prophet you see yes yes amen you see what i'm saying now yeah you cannot come without this word he spoke to the prophet and the one of god comes to them prophet and when you go you go back because we come because you recognize that you're part of this word yes amen you don't just pray you think you're praying by revelation and the revelation of the word comes to a prophet amen now god has ways of doing things he said i considered your case i'm going to sit to let you stay for that if you do that but he didn't he spoke to the prophet and sent the prophet all the way back up there again to tell him all right god heard your prayer amen see god revealed to the prophet what was going to happen come back your days is considered and you're going to come off the bed now in three days yes amen you got some politics and so forth put on him and hezekiah come of the bed and was made well now see what prayer does prayer is not exactly bringing god down to man it's bringing man up to god amen what i said earlier from the first dimension they're coming to this dimension they're coming down to be embodied yes but your prayer you going up you tapping to god's dimension amen and he is coming to dwell in you and use you amen amen is the opposite of satan's kingdom yeah it's bringing up man it's bringing man up to god as you pray you lose sight of these ugly things amen you sway out in some way else yes way beyond and on and on till you come into his presence amen amen where's that into the shekinah glory that was shown in type in the old testament yes amen but now you have access because in old testament only the priests could go there into their presence but to jesus christ you have access amen and then a faith that you have laid it out before god said now yeah god yeah yeah it is i want to get well for this cause i want you to do this for this cause i want you to heal me from this cancer or this tv or this anemia condition whatever it is i will work before you i will do everything i can i will give this chest to money everywhere i go amen you know before even god heals the person he knows whether the person is a testify of him or not he knows whether that person is going to go and rejoice and uplift his name amen look at that man that blind man yes the prophet said you are healed and he went but he never received his sight but he's claiming that he's healed yes amen and he went and he's saying he's healed but he still didn't really besides he's sitting in a in the barber shop and he's saying his heels but he still didn't receive his side but before you know it he just said it like that when he was trying to score at him and then his side began to come amen amen and that was a testimony amen yes and we know the testimonies went around the world now yes amen amen amen just like our blind but recorded in the bible this testimony is gone around the world amen i will give this testimony everywhere i go i will be happy to do that lord and i will use my life not for myself you see a person that's kingdom minded now yes i will use it for your glory amen and to help others to see you amen now then you lay there before god and say god will you consider my case i believe just as a zakaiah was oh god yet today don't you believe so every night he confirmed his right chair in the building if he did it then he says now i believe he will do it again tonight don't you and i believe he can do it again tonight amen because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen i like this quote he says pray that you never prayed before amen really get to business we're talking about a time now when you're in every need now a man that has to go into desperation now you're really trusting god for a need don't go appreciately amen and don't go reluctantly without faith you must go knowing there is a god that can make that promise come to pass amen you must go knowing that you are here to the promise that you're that is part of your redemptive blessings he says see if you just go up and say lord bless so and so god don't take interest much to that but when you really get down to business when your little boys and girls pray and get down to business do you do that in school do you ask god to help you in school you see you're writing your exams you're studying did you honestly go and ask god to help you for the exams and you're doing your part by studying but you say god i did my part lord i want you to give me the wisdom knowledge and understanding amen you don't make very good grades you go in and say god i want you to help me you don't just go like that do you pray how many little boys and girls pray lift your hands he said oh that's fine now that's good do you have a secret place where you go pray where mommy and daddy don't even see you do you pray like that you don't pray like that have a little place slip out and pray and say your little prayer you say it every night before you go to bed when you get up at morning and think oh that's good how many other little boys and girls their praise way over the building oh that's fine well now that's good that shows you've got a real mother and daddy that teaches you this thing now now when you really you get in need you better pray sincerely haven't you amen you see bring up the children from small teach them about the lifestyle of prayer amen yeah it becomes now when they're gonna need they got a situation they will go and consider it before the lord amen and you know in life life is such that is not every time you are comfortable just to share with certain of your pains with anybody there are certain things you only can go and explain to god because i'm talking about that that special time where you just you can't even talk you're just going to cry and he knows what you're going through would you just cry out bitterly but god answers the prayer amen because god is looking at your condition and your rightful attitude towards him he's got the time for you amen we need to make the time for him amen he's always got the time for us god is somebody that you will not disturb yes amen 24 7. amen seven days a week he's somebody that you cannot disturb he's got all the time for you he's got all the patience to hear you you know what i'm talking about sometimes you want to talk to somebody and they don't have the time for you they're always on a busy schedule right take your time off go into nature or lock yourself up in a closet go into somewhere where no one's going to disturb you put your phones off that's the worst most irritating thing when you prank go into nature you don't have to pray in front of everybody in your house when you the best time i know is to always enjoy when i drive the car that's why i never used to like lift clubs i never took lift clubs to work no matter how costly the fuel price was i always wanted to be alone because my best time was when i was driving the car and praying the best praise and worship is when you're alone in the car and you're praying that's why i always like to be alone in the car i don't like taking any lift clubs [Music] hebrews 4 16 says let us therefore come boldly unto the soul of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to him in time of need amen amen so you see don't just despair in your time of need if you know who you are you know that you have this redemptive blessing then go to him don't go to someone that's not going to help you don't go to the psychologist you're wasting your time yes it's going to take your medical either ego of the effect the human worse now they'll take cash up front go to the lord consult with him amen jesus said he that united my word and believe it on him that sent me as everlasting life not a big believer it's absolutely something that happened yes a conversion of the heart that changed you and brought you into another realm men are misunderstood christians women men boys and girls are misunderstood who lived in those places because it's contrary to the natural run life of life natural run of life among people of the world and i'm sure we all want to live in that atmosphere [Music] i said look the people we eat the manna out here on the ground was eating the same manner that the high priest eat in under the shekinah glory talking about the old testament now the same manner that they ate on the ground right that would come every day they had to eat it for the day they couldn't keep any extra because that was the what god told him you had to refresh manna and you were just and you had to keep me now for the day and the next morning you come again but he said what is see what he says here the same manner that i appreciate in under the shekinah glory he's saying but this manner whitted away out on the ground but that in the hidden place never with the away amen it lasted to the stands of earth and a man walking there when the high priest went in beyond that veil that veil had separated the holy from the holy of holies when he walked in there the veil dropped behind him that man he was even soundproof he was shut off from all the world and the surroundings he don't nothing in there but the living in the presence of god and a man a woman that ever walked into that kind of glory of god the whole world shut off behind him amen amen and right now we are now eating from the manner that never went away how many years since the spiritual flu you come under inspiration and realizing that you have the revelation of the word everything is shut off you don't see life like i used to see amen when you come under that kind of glory if a man hasn't found him placed there then he needs to go and come through the process come to justification come to certification come to the baptism of the holy ghost another inspiration walk into the presence of god amen where the fresh manner is amen [Music] amen god using what he said god and body now amen coming and speaking to you through the gifts come and give you a fresh manner week after week after week amen and it doesn't work away but now he's giving you fresh amen amen thank god for this message amen it's proven itself beyond hallelujah how can a message come from so many years ago be stored up taken up again and it makes sense in this day is that a work of a man how can you take this very message were stored up and in a time of famine now it's given out yes but it's making sense amen even in this day and it's making more sense as it goes on because you can see it more clearly as modern day events are made clear by out of the ground but death in that hidden place never did wither away it lasted to the spans of yours and a man walking there when the high priest went in beyond the veil that veil that separated the holies from the holy of holies when he walked in there the veil dropped behind that man it was even sound proof yes you see when you tap into that atmosphere amen what sound proof you don't want to hear you don't want to hear all the criticism you don't hear all the reasoning amen you only want to hear from the presence of god yes amen that sweet word amen oh that's your kind of glory and you recognize that this word is upon the presence of almighty god he said no matter what the devil says now the devil is saying it embodying people how the devil is speaking you tapped up there he comes in you they jump up here they come in people nice amen no matter what the devil says you don't pay any attention to it i've been criticized yeah come and give you a reasoning it doesn't matter how but my spiritual ears are closed to the world yes my spiritual ears are close to reasoning it's sun proof amen no matter what the devil says you don't pay any attention to it and he's living in a different atmosphere man oh this man that's living in this atmosphere amen how many of you say i'm that man that's living in the atmosphere i'm the son and daughter of god living in that atmosphere he lived in there where they put aaron's rod and he was nothing but an old dead stick of an olive tree but once laid in the presence of god it yielded what it was supposed to be in the beginning in one night's time it budded blossom and broad almonds amen amen yes amen god can take the violent sinner in one of its time he can baptize him with the holy ghost he can bring his power of transformation amen amen that's the same way that unbelievable is ever laid in the presence of almighty god under the influence of the holy spirit he becomes a new creature right then amen his life becomes fruitful he must become fruitful fresh life comes in and he yields what he was supposed to be a son of god born a sinner born of his world speaking lies born in inequity but when he comes and receives this light of this world amen it strikes the dream of god within him brings it forth to life and a transformation takes place amen god what it is this word is god's transforming power yes amen amen his life becomes fruitful fresh life comes in and he heals what he's supposed to be a son of god he was took off the tree so while the olive branch he was took off the tree but sinners and lukewarm church members become dry sticks oh they can't produce amen with some kind of a memory that some time there was a supernatural god of the past oh we don't want to look at what happened in the past we want to look what is happening in the now we want to look at the ever-present god working amongst the people doing the same works that he just did he's doing now because he said greater work than these years shall do yes [Music] in the name of jesus rise up and walk amen amen amen yes it must be a continuation of the book of acts amen that sometimes there was a supernatural god of the past that had life and way back there but if you believe and lay in his presence yes amen how are you going to lay this presence without a prayer for life how are you going to tap into that dimension how are you going to be in that atmosphere it will produce the same thing to you you will realize that you were born sons and daughters of god and will yield the fruit of the spirit but you can do it out there on the courts you can you got to do it in yeah that inside hid away not the man or in other courts he walked by daylight some days it was like raining other days it was sun would shine and nighttime would be dark and stormy he had his ups and downs that's the way you see people oh they say we're eating the good manner of god that's right but they are where are they living they're living out there eating in an atmosphere that should they should not eat [Music] in oh don't don't denominate around this world when you have the leadership of the holy spirit making this world fresh and fresh amen don't take a certain doctrine and denominate around it and then leave the holy ghost don't take a theory of a man you'll be stuck with the man's theory amen and then you forget to follow the leading of the spirit and god wants to give you something fresh the next man he had another light that was the man of the altar it was lit by seven golden candlesticks in little lambs and sometimes them lambs burnt low and they smoked up the chimneys and you know our lamb does smoking goes out and a man who comes to a place where he comes into the church out of the courts out of just a lukewarm church member and comes up to a little pretty good life in christ he separates and thinks from there but he's still living under lights and will get dim and smoke up an artificial light when he once walked in behind the holy earth of holies walked into the presence of god and the veil falls behind him there behind him there's a pot of manna where he can eat every day amen every hour of the week there's no end to this revelation it's an inexhaustible fountain of life he's just gonna get higher and higher and higher gonna move from glory unto glory amen that's where he's living in the shekinah glory we're in the interlocked wings of the cherubim the great puller of fire and the shekinah rested and is living under there he can't be nothing but a real genuine christian any time atmosphere amen amen men and women are living that they are misunderstood yes that's what you find when you got the baptism of the holy ghost your life is misunderstood yes because you're not going to compromise with every wing of doctrine you're not going to be tough to and fro right and they're misunderstanding you amen why you just can't hear them out how come we can't convince those people what type of people are this if they want to recognize that these people are not led by man but they are led by the leading of the holy spirit amen and they having they recognize that they are a continuation of the book of acts amen they become peculiar they don't hear the things of the world or if they do they don't pay attention to them amen they just move on amen god never put them in there for nothing oh amen you're not putting here for nothing amen amen god never come for just any haphazard way he said prayer is not perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to god can you talk to god about revelation can you talk to god without knowing who your god is without understanding the revelation of jesus christ so can a person sincerely go and pray to god without the revelation of his message praise not get down shut your eyes thinking about your washing or your work you're doing yeah yeah say lord help me and john and heal with jones and so forth that's not clear sure just repeating some words but prayer is to come into an atmosphere amen when you realize that you're in the presence of god and you're moving to them in the deepest of sincerity don't get astonished by people's high words in prayer people's uh screaming and shouting and praying amen because that's not going to take you in the atmosphere right amen first it's a worship yes wonderful thank you oh jehovah how i love you amen you see it thank you and after the worship of prayer then you come with a sincere asking if you abide in me not go out from behind the curtain in the world today and run about and try to get back in the curtains tonight you see not in and out of the world remember we fortified by this word not in and out of this word out of this word in satan's territory in the word you projected amen you are fortified remember satan can't go into the holy of holies you step out into east territory and you say look at what the devil has done to me you stepped out into east territory remember job was guarded when god removed those guards from him then when he satan could go and touch him and that was god's permission otherwise if you like aaron's rod they're pulled up to the shekinah glory by the golden pot of manna where you can eat it anytime and your soul is refreshed amen and blooming and yielding amen aren't you blooming and yelling aren't you refreshed all the time with his words isn't this worthy refreshing all the time abiding if you're abiding me my words abide in you and ask what you will it will be given to you amen you see if you're not in the atmosphere this word is going to be you put it here and take it out here put it here take it out yeah what i'm going to finish the message it's just going to be oh just a message just another scripture the person here's another quote the person read amen don't let it be another scripture to you don't let it be another quote to you let it become fresh to you let it become real to you let it let it be quickening to you right amen because this word has quickening power amen you see the failures of the church the pentecostal church the methodists the baptists and all it's failing to the abiding grace of god tonight you'll shout and clap your hands and dance in the aisle speaking tongue that's gifts gifts is no good unless you're abiding in the shekinah glory gifts are there the nine gifts of the spirit there but it's no good unless you are in the shekinah glory amen aren't we thankful tonight that we can abide in the shekinah glory amen so what are we speaking about tonight a prayer is an inevitable requirement of a believer because 1 thessalonians 5 16 to 18 says rejoice evermore pray without ceasing amen in everything give thanks but this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you quench not the spirit are you quenching the spirit you stop coming to the atmosphere you stop communicating when the spirit want to communicate with you you're not in his atmosphere what separated man and god god sins and what is sin disobedient to the word not disbelieving the word yes and what it did what did sin do it stop communication with men of god yes be careful philippians 4 6-7 says be careful for nothing but in everything but prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be known unto god and the peace of god would pass it all understanding shall keep your hearts and mind truthfully jesus just want to read a few scriptures 1 john 5 14-15 says and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he hurt us and if we know that yes whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition that we desire of him yes amen are you asking in your prayer mark 11 24 says therefore i say unto you what things whatever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall help them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses ephesians 6 17 to 18 says and take the element of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all sins amen amen and if there's any sick among you what the scripture says james 5 14 says is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith amen shall save the sick yes amen now let's take the scripture and analyze the scripture he says in the prayer of faith shall take firstly when you call the others it means you have faith in your scripture you took god at his word amen yes you was confronted about that scripture you were certain of god amen you had faith you had confidence in your elders yes you called them they came home amen they did their part what must happen now there must be a testimony amen amen last quote now remember this christ in the true true church is a continuation of the book of acts [Music] but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army you know the devil is going to hinder your prayer life right he's going to hinder you from staying with the world yes he's going to make you look at the world as just a time gone by he doesn't want you to catch go into the holy of holies and catch this fresh manna every day to heed this man amen because he knows that you become he says that he knows he said he knows talk about satan he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater work see satan knows this she will be an invincible army amen if they get a true revelation of the true spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's grace my god spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before he will be as definitely twatted today as when christ would stood his every effort to gain our own yes satan is revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us amen but we will prevail amen amen [Music] last scripture one time one says i exhort therefore that first of all supplication prayers intercession giving of thanks be made for all men or don't we love the people that love to intercede amen you know sometimes you have confidence to to ask a certain person to pray for you because you know that you're a true intercessor you know this person will really take the time and the effort to go and pray sincerely for you yes yes and giving thanks be made for all men for kings oh must pray for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty we must pray for king amen i'm going to give you a scripture revelation 10 8-11 for thou must prophesy again before nation tongues and kings and kingdoms in other words you are understanding the hour that you're living in you're praying concerning the hour now this is the abraham prayer now abraham was told the secrets of god that he's going to destroy solomon tomorrow what did abraham do when it was the role of christ into an intercessory role an interceded further for his family what did esther do when she found out that the jews was going to be elated a people was going to be killed she went into an intercessory role amen did she go in here did she go absolutely no no she asked the people to fast and pray she asked them to fast and pray then she put on a special robe yes and then she presented herself before the king she went with the right attitude amen she went under the right atmosphere yes amen when the king looked at her oh that love the king had forever anything that you and she would ask even to half of the kingdom was gonna be hers oh could it refuse that lovely sweet lady amen but this is god for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god and our savior who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time or don't we thank him tonight he is our intercessor amen we can go with our petitions to him amen could i have the musician we can go with our intercessions to him whatever our needs may be amen whatever we may ask for he's never tied to here he wants to meet with our needs want to see put a smile on your children's face yes he knows the things that we have need of even before we ask him amen we just got to go with the right attitude we got to go with a grateful heart we got to go with reverence exalting is hallowing his name go with
