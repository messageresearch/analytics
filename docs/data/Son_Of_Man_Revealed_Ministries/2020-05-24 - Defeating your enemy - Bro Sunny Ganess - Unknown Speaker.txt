matter what religion they are no matter what religious sect they come from all an evening calling on the name of God and this morning I pray that God will you will have a breakthrough in your life because we realize how close we are to the coming of the Lord our most gracious God and Heavenly Father we come to you man we know this morning it is just your hands upon us long though we cannot gun

now Lord we take authority upon your word kiss and bind every force of darkness every demonic spirit every spirit lurking around seeking whom he may devour bind it right now in the name of Jesus released the power the Holy Ghost take control now Lord now pray your blessing upon us now in Jesus name this morning I just want to greet each one of you in the lovely name of Jesus Christ we are so privileged this morning that we could stream this message live and you could listen at the comfort of your home and I pray you just give us give the Holy Ghost your undivided attention and let God speak to you this morning sometimes we become too lethargic sometimes we become too complacent and the time has come when we look around the world we can find that the coming of the Lord is so soon all these things are pointed that pointing out to one thing is the return of the Lord the Bible says when you see begin to see these things begin to happen say lift up your head for your Redemption draw nigh and this morning we realize how close we are to that coming but only thing that we have this morning is the Word of God the Word of God is established in your heart you know that you have a conquering you have a conquering power and this morning conquering power is only in the Word of God because the Bible says the Word of God is just the two-edged sword and it says it cuts both ways it cuts the preach and it cuts the people so this morning I want you to know one of these being said now is being said not only to you out there but it is also to the preacher this morning and now I just pray this morning that God will give you the grace that you will continue continue to serve him better every day even in these times of trials and the tribulations that we have I want to tell you this morning the only thing that we have and the greatest the greatest armor that we have this morning is prayer this morning and I pray that God will bless you we go straight into the word because of time constraint I'm not in international peace I just feel so nervous preaching in this through this medium of of service I just feel so inadequate but I just pray that the Lord will make a way lead us through this day and I pray that the Lord will give you grace while you listen we're going to turn to God's precious word this morning and I thank God you know sometimes God work in such a mysterious way and pastor Ronnie preached and that's that scripture that I'm going to read this morning and you know when the prayer well thought I was so so glad in my heart to know that the Holy Ghost is in our presence we've got a chance to look God's precious word second Thessalonians chapter 2 and we're gonna turn to Romans 8 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 1 now I beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in the mind or be troubled later the spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that Dasia shall not come she'll not come except there be they become a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition we can find this morning that this falling away is prevalent in our society in our our churches we find people come people go and some people have been here for thirty years some people have been here for 40 years but without a revelation you cannot serve God without a revelation of this message you are wasting your time and you better not waste more time you better go because God doesn't want this you can be very it can be a very very disappointed person when the rapture take place you can be a very disappointed person so if you don't have a revelation of this message don't waste your time in this message because this message is calling out a bride a bride without spot and without wrinkle this morning as we continue we will see that what God has in plan for you who opposed it and absorbed himself above all that is called God isn't that happening today or that is worshipped so that so that he has God sitteth in a temple in the temple of God showing himself that he is gone who else can do that today we find the people I don't know whether they have already met the ministers of all denominations the big boys of the of the churches they all have gathered and they've all have gone to meet the Pope I don't know if they've done it already or they still going to do it but this the Prophet said we might be thankful this morning that we had somebody come on on our way somebody came and met us on our way and showed us where this is all about and what it is all about what is going to happen and we are so glad this morning that we will not be deceived praise the Lord amen you happy that's why praise the Lord remember me not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know that we told it that he might be revealed in the hinnies time for the mystery of iniquity that already work only he who now letteth will let until he and he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of all unrighteousness in death in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved what is the love of the truth we consign find all these things are taking place in our in the presence of us those of you those people that are reading this message know these things are taking place and if you are not reading the messages you are not going to find out the truth and yeah it says that you will it says clearly that they have not received the truth and because they did not receive the truth that is why they are in that condition praise the Lord shall we go to Romans 8 Romans 8:35 praise the Lord who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long how we literally kill we are not literally killed but in our spirits we are killed all day long because we cannot see what is taking place our eyes cannot behold what takes place in our daily life sometimes we have to pass these things and pretend that we do not see them foot [Music] we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death neither death nor life nor angels no no principalities nor powers for things that present not not things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Jesus Christ may be seated praise the Lord glory to God glory to God this morning my subject I would like to treat this morning as a subject is defeating your enemy now we find this enemy was defeated in heaven he was defeated in heaven because he had a name which was called Lucifer and he thought he was brighter than everybody else he thought he was more brighter he was more better he was more eloquent he was more the best man of the place and he could be able to rule because when he saw God what God has done he thought he was even greater than God but this morning I want to tell you this very same thing is taking place in our homes because somebody in the home wants to feel the better person somebody in the home want to criticize somebody else this is taking place and our work please somebody at work wants to feel a better person that spirit never died it never dies it is still and then you find this even in the school some person want to feel better than the other person he's greater than you he's better than you this is also taking place in the churches in the chat you'll find the one preacher thinks he is better than the other preacher the other preacher thinks he's greater than the other one the other one thinks he is he's more Aloka than the other one my brother my sister I might not be located I might not put up the words in the right places I might not say anything in the corner the consistency that you wanted but I know one thing that God has called me to preach this gospel to the time they're in a generation to preach the gospel in this message to know to people to know that we are playing on the other side and my only purpose that I'm preaching this gospel that I don't want to miss you I don't want to miss you because I want to see you on the other side while we sing the songs of Zion on the other side we know we can rejoice we can rejoice together sometimes people feel that they got a better ministry than the pastor and I want to tell you you cannot have a better ministry than the pasta no matter who you are no matter what you are no matter what grade you went to school or me no matter what what education you have you cannot be better than the pastor because the pastor was was was ordained to be a pastor he was called to be somebody was called to be somebody to live on because he has he has the the abilities of a shepherd you cannot be better than the teacher because the teacher was ordained to be a teacher and he would teach the flock you can be look you cannot be better than the Evangelist because he was called to bring in the flock and that's his ministry so what people want to do you see the spirit never died the greater the greater you want to be yourself but it is time that we can humble ourself and because of the same reason he was kicked down from heaven he was sent down from heaven for the same reason because he wanted to be greater than the one that that created him God created him but he wanted to be greater than God he wanted to show that he can do things better than God he was trying to get the people together you know this is also in the church today where you get people trying to try to come together trying to be a clique get together like cliques and try to form something against the church this is happening the spirit never died let spirit is there all the time it's come down from there it's right ya know and we find this morning that when he was sent down he never stopped he never stopped doing what he did so he brought two-thirds of his angels down and when he came down he was a very successful one he was defeated in heaven and when he came down it became a successful one he was in a position such as to seduce the first bride he said used the first bride he was successful then he was also successful in bringing in they saw the meek spirit into the church and you might say how could you talk like this bring in the sodomy condition in the church when you look at the churches today Sodom is inside the church ministers failed to realize that they could make it mess in the church ministers fail to realize they got nakedness in the front leading the people pastors have failed to recognize this son he was successful in putting shot him into the church he was very successful in seducing the second bride he was successful he seduced the second bride at neisha when they took on the Teletubbies ten Trinity spirit when they took on when the church took on the the spirit of the of the Roman Catholic Church he was successful in that and that's when we got Christmas we got Easter we got all these things all these other things we got and we have a tertiary the doctrine but the problem of God says but the problem of God says that this bride would not fail this bride will never be said used this bride will give is ready now to go over on the other side and this bride will never be defeated this bride will defeat the enemy this morning amen praise the Lord you happy praise God this morning amen and when he was right there in the Garden of Eden but you see God in all his glory God in all his power God in all his love what he did he did not leave he did not leave them as they were although they were seduced although they were defeated but God came along and when God came along what he did he gave them a promise and he gave them a great promise he said octave I'm not going to go through the whole thing after the kiss and he said the woman see you shall bruise the head of the setter hallelujah that was a great promise a great promise that he gave the church today and he knew that was when God's God gave a promise that this was meant to take place some day or the other where we will come back well it will come back to to Eden and this morning we find it he was still successful all along because he got hold of cake and when he got hold of Cain what happened King was so angry he was so despondent because he brought the sacrifice Abel brought the sacrifice and that is why this morning you cannot serve God without revelation you cannot serve God without the revelation in this message you wished in your time now Cain brought the sacrifice and Abel the sacrifice Abel must have been telling Kane listen yet this is what happened in the Garden of Eden this is who your father is and he was wrong Cain was a rock and you know what God did not leave God did not leave the God took some time God took some time and he came to King and he came to kill the Tholian King you will do better if you only do what your brother done but you see sometimes stubbornness sometimes elegance get hold of us and because arrogance gets all of us we want to do our own things we don't want to be in subjection to what God wants us to do and we move on from there and be fine this morning then what happened there was Cain slew his brother and even went on you see he didn't want to listen although God took the time to come and speak to him but he didn't want to listen you see sometimes when God is speaking to us we don't want to listen when God speak to us we need to heed the call of God we need to listen to God's Word and this is what happened he didn't listen and he went his way and you see this is it and then he even had it had a daughter see sometimes you know we question God we should never be questioning God this morning we should just accept what God says we should just accept God's what God gives us this morning we want too much and one more than what built what we can swallow this morning but God gives it to us in measures and we need to know the measures he gives us and therefore I say to you this morning it never stopped there he has a success yeah is the success of Satan when we find this morning Satan is also defeat along the way he has his success and after now he still got a success because he's placed the churches in such a condition that if somebody walks into the church he would know that his is not in the church if some really religious person some person that has a revelation works into a church you'll know that he's not in the church anymore and that's what that's how successful he's up to this point and we find this morning we find one of our our fathers of the faith Abraham Abraham father of the faith really a great man in the Bible we can really stories and we know Abraham staggered not at the promise of God and that's what the Bible says that we can see it there and we find this morning Abraham when he went out when he was called out to be separated and you know although in God called the separation he needed two totally separate they don't want anything niggling around you and many times and God called the separation we have people we have things niggling around us but God doesn't want the niggles so I'm sure this morning Abram was such a bad you know like we have our favorites sometimes we have a nephew sometime we have a nice sometimes a grandchild sometimes a brother or a sister that's our favorites we have favorites we cannot deny that we cannot deny that any mother will tell you that she has a favorite any father will tell you that he has a favorite a my life Oh staying quiet let's say this morning Abram when he looked at his nephew he say this boy yeah amen hey this boy is my boy I'm not leaving him I'm taking him along it's come a lot let's go now not get up he says okay I'm going with my uncle and he gets on the grain the movie and then come they come to a place and to the plains of Mamre and when they come to mama knee they decided to camp and the plains of Mamre well why they decided to camp in the plains of Mamre it was good it was good Abram was happy because he heeded the call of God he needed to separate and now he's right there the plains of Mamre is standing there and I think maybe one night Abram came outside and then he stood out there and he began to look out there and he looked maybe looked at the lights and and the rest of the things out there you know that the glitter and the rest of the things of Sodom but when Abraham looked at that it meant nothing to Abram because he knew the things of this world will perish hey brain was looking at the heavenlies he never looked at the Stars he may be turned around and look at the desert he may be turned around and look at the fields he may be turned around and look at the world and when you look at these lights and this blind man the rest of the things and you know you know sometime when you're at home and when these boys starting to play music and stuff like that you can hear it buzzing you can be going to bed but you can hear this music buzzing it's coming from maybe one of the townships or maybe coming from one of the squatter camp or maybe coming from your neighbor's house this music is buzzing and I'm sure now while they look from memory they're looking out there and they're looking at the buzzing the music buzzing the lights glittering everything is taking place there Sodom is is a city on its own if I must've just looked at it it said ah this is not for me this is not for me you know I want to tell you something this morning you know the number of times I went past Sevilla the number of times I went past Suncoast when you see those lights and you see all those things they really really I want to tell you the encouraging you can be encouraged to go there many times people tell me well you won't ever be good music but I'm scared I want to tell you I'm scared they say you know in the samaya sometime my wife also said you know what I'm gonna have a meal you know you're going to go to that but me you're not gonna do anything else there but I'm scared you know why if somebody sees me coming out from there they're not going to tell me the day manova will tell the people I saw swear the sunny that's why I'm coming out from sabaha huh they look good after say he came he went and had in me room you see that is what we must know where we are we must know our position we must know where we are placed we must know where we go to they're not going to say are they going to tell the people maybe it's not in bad intentions many of us sometimes don't have bad intention sometime the people out in the world don't have bad intentions also so let's say I saw brother sunny in sabaha now the picture what is doing in Survivor is it immediate talk what is being in psychos it's immediate thought what you're doing there they're not saying you went for a meal they're not saying you went to to buy something because the shops there all they know you went to Sevilla so that's what I'm saying this morning we need to know where our feets are also we need to be safe as preachers of the gospel you need to know where you are you need to know your position God has placed you in your position so this was Abram the Royal seed of God unless it's pasture and message believer a message prophet Alleluia when he came out nothing could change his mind yeah isn't Raman el denominational believer he comes out lot comes out and when he looks he looks out there he looks at that place there immediately is hard to start talking and when he looked there he sees a hold it man hey this is something beautiful lovely hear the music lovely we can dance to this music lovely everything is good that's what he looked at for him a nominal denominational believer and this is where I want to say you the prosperity gospel stats the prosperity gospel starts because not in his mind you can make that's where I can make the money that's where can make my living that's where I can do everything because that was his destination when he looked out there yes you say okay you know what how can you how can you immediately put this on yes today you find everywhere you go to church anyway I can challenge you this morning you go to church it's only money you're going to church it's money you're going to church its nakedness you go to church everything that is in trouble and that is why Jesus said like in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man because it is there it is right in the church leave the world out the world is another place it's in the church this is a nominal nominal denomination of believer now he sees he sees the attraction there there is an exception yes and he watches it and you see the devil is coming the devil is so cunning he knows now lot and his uncle Abram I'm a very good relationship and I'm gonna fight now when he saw you see the devil sees what you have what your design is that's what the devil is looking at it here their desire now when he saw watch the design then he says no I don't go to loved now go to his headsman now it goes through his headsman and then he puts the strike he puts the strife and that is what I'm saying this morning it puts your strife between the headsman and then now this is exactly what happens in the church maybe the deacon is a good brother maybe the the trustees are good but then the youth the devil uses somebody from the congregate somebody to use that is a high tight spin unite tight there so he uses him to come in and try to disrupt everything in the church so this morning you find he was not not looked at this thing he said hey you know what this is going to be mine so there comes the devil puts a strife between the headsman and you know Abram being a son of God even as being a prophet of God even knew hey this is not for me and then one day he came out he says hey before you know it this happens sometime at home it happens at home and when the strife at home you know between the mother and the daughter the son decides they gotta go the thousand go sometime between two brothers this safe one brother decides they let me go you see it happens the devil puts a psyche in danger and when the devil puts a stripe there now and you know it makes it so bad every muscle came out it so these guys might be fighting for the grazing land and fighting and fighting and he said hey you don't want hey this is no good we can't live fighting and that is the real reality believers kind of fighting you know so what he did it came out call him rot come here my son choose this day which way you want to go you have the east you have the west you have them not you have this out choose this day which way you want to go nicely this is a believer I believe I wouldn't want anything for himself a believer will always want to give the first prevalence when you come to a point this money when you come to a point when you want everything for yourself remember where you offer so yeah is he giving the choice and gave the choice to him and I can tell you this morning not much that said you know what I saw last night what I saw last night cannot change my mind cannot change my heart it's a diagram this is my lord I think green he was a nominal nominal denominational believer you went out there you know for you this morning to go out somewhere with us nakedness for you to go out somewhere with is ratalie for you to go out somewhere with this pattern where for you to go somewhere with these chaos you cannot stand it as a believer you cannot stand and if you can stand that then there is something wrong with your experience something wrong with your experience if you can stand those things you know sometimes your cars going past oh you know I think you know what whether these people are deaf you know you you you you can't stand that anymore and today you hear the songs that's been played the guy would be dancing to somebody's wedding his mother you know that he's dancing to somebody that is wearing his mother's letting his father selling his sister's wedding everybody is dancing to that see where the devil got everything he got everything is successful in everything that he's doing because he's not attacking the people out there those people he's not worried about he's attacking the people in the church and this is my message today the devil is attacking the people in the church and the church has to have the power to defeat me hallelujah praise the name of Jesus and yeah not decided to pack up and go it must have been said in his heart because that was his choice to bring in him so sometime when people leave when people leave home your son leaves home you are sad in your heart to see your son leave home you're sad in your heart to see your daughter Nemo at the able that must have been in the same situation but said it is hard to see his nephew go but he had to let him go because God is they're not long from there we're not going to go through the whole team now because there's so much I don't know I don't have a time my battery is gone and my watch but I'm just using it then what happened not long after that they got a message Abraham gets a message it says your nephew now your nephew is recaptured and this nephew is captured they're taking his wife taking his children taking everything taking his position and their brother even set it up now you see this is what it is strength should not bring hatred between the brother and anything any strength should not stop the president from continuing and this is what the devil has done Abram see he had the love of God he had the Spirit of Christ they gathered these things up when he gathered all these things and he said go I gather these men I think it was a hundred three hundred I wouldn't know the figure now finish read that and he gathered all his men three men and he went after those kings why because that was his brother that was his brother when you see your brother down and out when you see your brother finished when you have specie your brother defeated it is your duty my brother it is your duty to go after him it is not duty to chase and to get him to beam and come and make him stand it's fallen situation he must stand and this morning I want to tell you if you do what Jesus did Jesus left the thousands and he went after the one and a preacher say I don't need up anything I don't need up anything if anybody want to leave can leave if anybody want to go can go I don't need anything I said well it depends where you where where you've got your spirit from you see now if Jesus this is how this is what if we preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ this is what we have to do it now if I'm centered up any width it finished and he had at God with him there's no two-way about that he went and slaughtered the kings and his father's the kings brought everything I attended back to not and on his way back from the story of the king he met Melchizedek hallelujah on his way from the slaughter of the kings he met his Melchizedek hallelujah and when he met Melchizedek it was a greatest moment of his life this morning you can have Malka dick in your life but provided you squatted the kings in your life because you had many kings in your life if you can slaughter them you can beat Melchizedek but if you can't start it you can't meet Melchizedek yeah it was when you went along Cain and you can meet them your your your kings that align within you man this hatred lying backbiting all those things are sitting on you kill those kings and meet Melchizedek this morning you will never go wrong and as long as you do that you see the the separation the separation did not stop the Brotherhood from saving his brother from a defeat this morning and this is where Satan this is where the enemy was defeated the enemy was defeated and Abraham defeated the enemy because he had no guy looking hallelujah praise the Lord Amen how much more time do I have there was a time when we find the whole Jewish nation the entire Jewish race was going to be annihilated and God has made a promise that this was his people but everything was set for them to be elevated we find this morning we look at the Jewish race and when they were under captivity it was Mordechai but Mordechai looked at this and you can read it in the book of Esther I think it's a fun telling fourth chapter you'll find what happened wanna cry when he heard that Helen was going to destroy the entire Jewish nation what did you do eat Ghana you see this is where we have to learn prayer we need to get down and play in this time of distress we need to pray in this time of distress we need to go down on our knees and this morning we find the entire nation the entire world is under knees in the past there was just a few people going down in the knees on a Sunday morning but a few people bring down on the knees on a Wednesday night a few people pulling down on their knees during that during the course of the week but now we could find the entire world in the streets everywhere crying out crying out where are you God what was there all the time he was there all the time he never changed his position he never changed this place he was there all the time and this morning it behooves us this morning to know the time that we are living in and yet was Mordecai put on sackcloth and ashes although there was a degree that nobody should wear secular philosophy but the goddess sacra the nauseous he didn't care anything he went down and he they started to pray and he started to pray and I tell you what happened then they call for Esther Esther came and they all got together they started playing and Esther went on a fast also and they were known a fast and playing sometimes we think like you know fasting and claim fasting and praying is nothing but I want to tell you fasting and praying is dynamic it's something that we should be doing we should not have any excuse for that and here was then playing and and what happened you know she went and and she even said you know what what happened to the king doesn't accept me but yeah was it because of the fasting and the player the fasting and the plan the king had to accept and as it came out with a scepter he gave an a scepter and she received it and this morning and when that meeting went on they had to go to a banquet molokai and the rest of them they had to go in the timberlands they all went to a banquet and at the banquet there was two banquet set and they have to discuss and I'll tell you one thing the enemy can be defeated through player your enemy can be defeated through fasting your enemy can't be defeated because you take on the name of Jesus Christ nothing can stop it your enemy is defeated he can be successful outside the message but in the message is unsuccessful he's a nothing in the message this morning a man and yet was Mordecai playing any one-handed he had a gallows made for Mordecai he prepared especially for Mordecai and what happens after everything finished after everything was finished the very same gal that the enemy prepared for Mordecai had to be hanged at the same girls the enemy was defeated hallelujah the enemy was defeated ready because there was somebody who took up the stand and the Jewish race was saved and the enemy was defeated hallelujah praise Oh glory to God this morning the enemy was also defeated and camel there was a one common and the enemy was defeated day you find this morning Elijah Elisha had to come and he found these prophets of Baal all prophesizing and the same thing we have this morning the prophets of Baal prophesy one God prophesied we say the rain is going to come and kill this coronavirus one guy is prophesied many people will die who doesn't know many people will die one of us know many people are going to die you don't have to prophesied that and some people are listening to it and they're getting so excited because it's a prophesized many people are going to die many people are going to get sick who don't know that that's all in the news is that a prophecy that's not a prophecy but prophecy comes it will tell you something that is not happening before it happens and they couldn't tell before it happened only when is happening now he said if people are gonna die all of us know that people gonna die you get an uneducated man in the road you tell you the people gonna die so what do you want a prophecy for that so here was the improper saying the same people this one the same proper top valve are still in existence the spirits never died let spirits oh yeah so we have to be careful this morning and there was a showdown showdown had to come and Elijah had to be elected answers he had to replace the word he had to take the word and place it in the right place he had to put the altar in his position and then he said to them come on let's have this showdown and what happened there Elijah because he had the presence of God he had the presence of God a demon and he defeated the enemy all the prophets had to die because he Leiter was a successful one because he had the presence of God enemy was defeated once more right there at Carmel this morning we find the enemy had another showdown the enemy has another shoulder the enemy came to Calvary we find this morning he was defeated at Calvary once more we find that Jesus was offered everything is he Satan the devil he doesn't play games because he knows every tactic because he is coming from the presence of God and he knows everything he knows how to act he knows what to do you see and over the ages the word was lost then what was misinterpreted misplaced and people just continued the people that were looking for Jesus couldn't find him because they were in another dimension they were looking at things differently they were looking at the scriptures differently so they couldn't find their Messiah and it came to pass that God allowed his son because that was the only way that our redemption could take place and was the only way that we could go to Calvary that's the only way that we could go back to the Garden of Eden so what happened right over there they took him they whipped him they spat on him they did everything that they could do the death of the Cross is one of the most cruel deaths because when you're hanging on the cross your body gives in when you're hanging on the cross the whole body collapses and so this is what happened when he went there and when they placed him on that cross he said he'll isleye lama sabachthani which means my God my God why those and then he said it was finished right there the enemy was defeated right at the cross of Calvary but in the defeat this morning there was two people on the other either side in that defeat one had to call ahead one had to go to paradise because that one recognized and yet a revelation although he never studied the Bible although he never study the message he uh no he never studied anything but he had a revelation of who he was on the cross and when he turn on the side he looked at the other guy he said save yourself but they brought to a prisoners but the woman had the revelation but one didn't so we are back to the idiom equally condition this money and we find this morning that right there Jesus went right down he went right down to hell he took the keys of death and hell and the grave and he came out and I could imagine this morning Ezekiel standing there and while he's mocking they said maybe I can just have a look who is that he says I can see that one that one was the wheel within the wheel hallelujah he says I can't look at I recognized him praise the Lord and Daniel was standing there and says yes that's the one I see you not on a mountain he is the one that was there in the lion's den change like Meshach and Abednego came up there and then when they came in to look they said yes this is the one he was the fourth man in the fire glory to God this morning hallelujah yeah enemy is defeated and the enemy can take it defeated in your life on to this morning praise our Lord this morning and that's what Calvary was Calvin he was taking us back that same shepherd was bruised at Calvary we go back to the in any condition this morning how they knew there was a showdown there was among common defeat there was a Calvary defeated among Carmel defeat and a Calvary defeat now they were there is amongst sunset defeat hallelujah when the word was invaded the word came out hallelujah we not have the written word and the spoken word we have the entire word revealed to us we know where we are we know who we are we know where we come from we know where we're going through this morning we know this morning we can cherish the prophet we can change the prophets message this morning knowing that he is the only one that came to take us to tune to prepare this bride to go on on the other side this bride hallelujah this bride has never failed although there was time that that we have our child we have our temptation we have everything that is going with us and this morning but but the enemy is defeated because the book is open the book is open the full word is revealed we have nothing to worry about all we need this morning is to stay with the word stay in line stay in line with this word of God and as long as we can stay in line with this word of God it says the world has come and now that the bride has made herself ready to enter into the other dimension this morning we are going to move on to the next dimension and that's not going to be very long as we see these things happening around us the Bible says lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh hallelujah praise the Lord this morning amen we have the three times the enemy has been defeated you know God it's so thoughtful about his people this morning God is so thoughtful about his people God never wanted one to perish he never wanted one to perish he never wanted anyone to perish you know I love the story of the rich young ruler every time when I read that story I preached many many sermons on the rich young ruler and I loved it so much because God took time to come and talk to me God took some time to come and talk to me he was afforded the opportunity of his life many a time you say you know what if I was a little ruler I should just go and do that but this morning you are in the same situation this morning you are just like the rich son you are standing right there as a rich young ruler and you sitting at your home this month you are just like the rich young ruler a God took time and this morning God is taking time through my voice to speak to you this morning and as he spoke to him you know he was such a good man it must have been a little con man he must have had everything in his life and because he had everything in his life whatever he came to God he met God face to face none of us will ever have that opportunity this morning and many people in these days never had the opportunity to meet God face to face why I say made God many people who say that this is a son of God a second person of the Trinity no he was God because there is none rule and a revelation and he knew it was God because when he came to him and asked him good master what must I do that I may inherit eternal life hallelujah and he said why callest thou me good because there's nobody else that is good it says only God is good topic of God is good see he recognized it and when he recognized it he saw this was God I wonder was it apply it was a very simple tip line because God saw straight through his heart what was his problem what was his problem and his problem was what he had many things that he had he had nice cars and a nice house big bank balanced many servants many of everything and today if you are sitting there he's speaking to you right now so he went away a defeated man because he couldn't do that and all he done was returned to his normal work and you see this is what it needs some time on you arrogant this is what it is when you are stabbing some time this is what it is he went out not thinking what was asked of him to do when he went out he said I would build bigger plans you see this is making a mockery of God well many people this morning make a mockery out of this message I want to tell you this morning you can make a mockery out of this message this message is real this message is real it's come from the tone of God it's an unbending big advance I will pack the bands up I will make more money I will beat this and I will be dead but the same night you say he couldn't defeat his enemy the only reason he couldn't defeat his enemy was because he had too much so when he went out and the same one night the angel of the Lord came down and said thou fool thou fool your life is required tonight nobody can make that decision people are scared scared to get today Corona Corona everywhere you go is Corona I want to tell it in this morning if God is not finished with you there's nothing can touch you he will take you whether its Corona with a accident whatever it is he will take you when he's finished so you should not be worried as a believer when your time is up you will go and call him down fool fool and what the Bible says about a fool this morning the Bible says a fool has said in his heart that there is no God and yet he met God so he didn't believe it was God so that is why he said in his heart so he couldn't defeat his enemy because of his position and this morning we look at the color at the opposite side we look at Zacchaeus hallelujah praise the Lord Zacchaeus was trying to find out who this man is Zacchaeus was trying to find out you know sometimes a key has become the school lesson for people but I'll tell you this is more than a Sunday School lesson this is something for that to think about what really happened in Zacchaeus is like you know we've used to sing this song Zacchaeus climbing up the tree you know but I want to tell you this is more than that if you have a revelation and yet what Zacchaeus up there it's time to get a glimpse of Jesus Christ and when he was trying to get a glimpse of Jesus Christ Jesus came right there seemed like this morning as we were as the pastor was playing he was playing the scripture that you have really hallelujah so if your heart desire if you have a desire in your heart to see God you're gonna see God and here was suckiest and Jesus came and stood right underneath and when he stood right under there he called him down he said Zacchaeus come down I'm coming to your house but there was a great great what he called despair among the people this man yet this man dead Scaletta evil man he wants to go to his house that's who God came for he came for the tax collector it came for the evil he came for those that couldn't reach out to him he didn't come for those that can reach out to you came for those that cannot be taught me so you see the Dalek contrast this morning between the rich young ruler and Zacchaeus Zacchaeus accepted life and been and the devil and the enemy in his life was defeated he said Lord I will give four times more than when I took I will give more than what I do if somebody if somebody even comes with a false accusation is that I give them - because he regarded the things of the world as nothing and this morning you can regard the things of this world that's nothing and this morning our saves that you can go and and do many things in your life because everybody is looking for a good life you cannot find anybody that is not looking for a good life but let your good life be channeled and be and be in line with the Word of God your good life with all the money that you want with every good thing that you want because God gives good things and because God gives good things he doesn't want you to neglect serving and what is happening today because we get so much we neglect serving God we don't even go to a wedding today night service now I think my wedding today night service is going to be full we don't even want to come to a Sunday morning service because you want to check the time I want to tell you the time is at hand that time is at hand I'm closing we find the prodigal son the prodigal son we know the story very well because I don't want to I don't want to go too much in depth with each I just want to give you the overview of the prodigal son now the prodigal son he had a good father he could have a good house he had everything but he wanted his inheritance he wanted dad you know what death I am tired of this life then only church only prayer meeting only fasting only playing I am tired of this life then I'm sick now I need to go out and find what is out there I need to go there you see the devil comes in there yes the enemy comes in there and against control of you and I fight I love this boy and he said son because he loved him he didn't want to to disappoint him you know when you love somebody you don't want to disappoint that somebody nobody wants to do that as much today all of us would never did Manny mi night pastor Ronnie if you love somebody you don't want to disappoint that somebody he loved his son too much so he said I'm okay son Tico's even out there he saw said aiya he saw Suncoast he saw well Coast he saw all the coasts he had a ball of a time drank himself sick he danced himself sick he played everything sick and then eventually when he looked down even sold his last pair of shoes see what the devil can do to you this morning yeah that's what the devil can do to you your enemy can do this to you when you look down you look down at his feet and he said I don't even had a shoe and you know in the in the old days in the Old Testament days only slaves didn't wish so he became a slave to his enemy and then he went out looking for a job but he had so much see this is what happened and he went out after waiting waiting not going on and the only job that he could find wasn't a pigpen that was awesome you go there and when he started to do he went in there to take the job because he was desperate he's enemy put him in such a situation that he was desperate so he went there and he started to mind no swine mmm and then in the same process he started to eat people food sadly the husk and you know buddies picked food this morning I don't have to tell you and then one day while sitting down there he came back to his mind as I and a daughter will come back to them and that is why the Bible says clean up your child in the ways of the Lord so when they grow up they will not depart from the faith so here was an enemy now defeating this boy girl thank his feet and he must have said in my father's house there are so many servants we have so much up for treating and there isn't nothing my father's house to give anybody I will rise up this is what you need to do this morning say I will rise up not my brother not my sister not my mother not my father but I will rise up he rose up anyway and he went I can just imagine the father's love blood is his boy whom he loved so much sitting down out there in the balcony and looking through the through the day and to the evening to see where my lost son was and where my lost son is when he's gonna return and then one morning or one day when he looked out the he saw his son he saw his son coming from far away with his demise you recognize God is seeing his sons and his daughters coming from far away a girl recognizes you and her he was coming closer he says that is my son that womb was lost is now found and as he got closer father went down Karlis Evans told him to cut the fender make the means and he came there was no Kelowna at that time it just grabbed his sanity hug his son favor I told this is the son was once lost now he's found hallelujah Runnymede 77s he said to his father I am not worthy to even be your servant isn't that's how we feel this morning we feel that we are not worthy this money but because of him we become worthy now has he got everything prepared he was asleep - the enemy put a fuse on his feet put a ring in his finger mmm so he is back he's part of the family hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord and then that enemy that took this boy was now defeated that enemy that has taken you is now defeated it's now defeated and I pray this morning that God will make a way for you where there seemed to be no way I'm closing we're just gonna close it one scripture this morning should we stand you can stand wherever you are this morning even in your home you just stand this morning defeating the enemy I pray when we when we get the lockdown over you will hear this message in the full context whatever it had been preached just because of time constraint we just preached half of this message this message is the wrong message don't fear to come to church because it's a long message you come to church to listen to the Word of God hallelujah praise the Lord this morning we're going to read Ephesians 6 you see we have to get ready because the battle is raging there's nothing that you cannot see this morning as a believer as a child of God you return to the fold and I want to tell you this morning you can see the battle is raging everything is in front of you everything is staring at you this morning all the things that you know this battle was defeated at sunset mountain but the Word of God was revealed and this morning I'm telling you this morning that this word is revealed there is nothing else that you can do stay fast and hold fast to the Word of God and the Word of God can deliver you from the hands of the enemy this morning amen Ephesians 6 if you have it 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places spiritual wickedness in high places is not the government it's not the government forget that spiritual wickedness in high places he's a church he's American he's a church leaders this morning they have the spiritual wickedness in high place might be so in Oakland there may be so so so pious may be so so entertaining but if you have a look at it that is spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil days we are right in the evil days so put on the whole armour of God what is the whole armour of God the whole armour of God is the will of God and nothing else hallelujah stand therefore having your loins get it Oh glory about the truth what is the truth the truth is aware of God that truth is a message of today that truth is the message of this day there's nothing else but the message of this day hallelujah praise the Lord and having on the breastplate of righteousness cast aside evil dream and get and become righteous in the eyes of God because it cannot be when the day will come where some of the people will be the most disappointed people the most disappointed people in the world and the most disappointed people on the planet will be a message believers and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace hallelujah aren't we prepared with the gospel of peace this morning above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God hallelujah praise our Lord this morning I just want to encourage you we are living in the last days this is not something to try to put fear in your heart but if it is so that fear in your heart by the Bible says the fear of God is the beginning of all wisdom and this morning I want you to know you can be the same you can defeat your enemy your enemy is defeated and your enemy was defeated at Calvary and this morning every sickness every pain every ache every sorrow every tribulation everything stops at Calvary it doesn't go beyond Calvary so this morning just place your burdens at Calvary wherever you are this morning seated in the comfort of your home just stand just stand this morning lift up your hands and say Lord may I not be that Easter and ruler may not be like the prodigal son going out and coming back may i lord save you in this

closer to God we have to become desperate hey man we have to let off everything else we have to surrender ourselves totally to God and become consecrated unto Him just like in our desperation when when there was a plot to kill the Jews and estra got into a desperation and she consecrated herself yes and she got the people to consecrate themselves and she began to intercede on behalf of her people we got to come to the tower now just like before Sodom was destroyed Abraham began to take on the intercessory role and he began to in the seat to God to intercede on behalf of these people and we are in that situation today we are kept for an hour such like this and the bride of Jesus Christ we are kept for an hour such as this to cry inside for the abomination of the Lost and we have a desperation with us yes to cry out to God for the lost for loved ones and to do all that we can to bring that last one in and to carry on preaching the gospel until the consummation that is our
