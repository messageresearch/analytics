========================================
[Music] hallelujah amen new things are being declared they have been declared amen amen hallelujah father we thank you Lord we can come before your most holy presence yes Lord we lift you up in our Praises oh god father we exalt you King of Kings Lord of lords there is none like you Lord Jesus even now we take this moment to prostrate ourselves before you humble ourselves in your presence amen we want to give you all the honor and praise that's you to your name oh god father we come with Thanksgiving in our hearts we enter your courts with Thanksgiving amen we come with praise in our hearts Lord Jesus Lord when we think of how you chose us how you elected us we can't find any virtue in that Lord in our human thinking we don't know why you chose us but Lord your Prophet came to tell us Lord that we had a gene seed within us amen and we were trapped into this world for sin but the Father's Love sent Jesus to the Earth and as Jesus proclaimed all that the father has given me will come to me and not one of them is lost amen we thank you Lord for your predestinated thought of us Lord we know that's an eternal thought oh God that's a quality thought oh God that you had of us no matter Lord the circumstances that we face oh God we can look to you look to the Cross we can look to your finished work oh God and even as you built us now oh God in your word and now we know our identity in you Amnesia is taken away the bride is in a position she's fully operational in this hour and Ministry and Lord we stand your proud displaying the banner of Jesus Christ the banner of love we thank you Lord you have gathered us under this great Banner of Charity we love you we appreciate you we pray you'll bless everyone that has come into the house of the Lord we pray Lord that you would receive the praise Glory and Honor even now Lord Jesus bless the hero of the word and I pray Lord for any needs amongst us I pray Lord for deliverance I pray for healing I pray for restoration I pray oh God that even as the word is being preached that every need will be met I ask it now in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with much Thanksgiving amen amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen Our God and King who is worthy to be praised amen hallelujah amen for he is the king of kings and he's the Lord of lords amen amen and this king is no longer single right yes this King is a married King yes amen amen hallelujah amen when he came to the Earth about 2,000 years ago he came looking for his bride amen and he was put to sleep on the cross and a spear went into his side to release that hidden portion of himself amen hallelujah amen and then you know in Revelation 5 Revelation 5 the prophet of God tells us that he comes out of the sanctuary looking for his Queen amen looking for those names in the book am amen so we just love the Lord we can keep talking about that amen so I greet you all in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen greet our brother Moses amen our sister Rachel parents of brother Joshua and brother Jeff we welcome you pray be blessed amen God bless you brother Barnabas amen pray be blessed in the house of the Lord amen any other visitors here we are no we're not really visitors we're not strangers amen we are just pilgrims amen sojourners so we welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so let's go to our Bibles we'll go to Revelation 10: 11 I want to get one portion of scripture there amen for a little thought amen I want to speak on the Bright's Jubilee trumpet in the days of our prophecy amen amen the Bright's Jubilee trumpet in the days of our prophecy am amen so let's read Revelation 10:1 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen so the last portion of the ministry is given to John who's a type of the Bride yes that's how the Gentile dispensation ends so we can't be happy coming into the message just happy and content just receiving the word amen here John is asked to release the word that he has received amen there was the eating part but it ends with releasing you are what you eat so the commission is thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings if you read Revelation chap 13 and Revelation 17 you'll see that people Nations tongues and kings are being hell captured by the Beast so that's why the prophetic word has to be released because who has the names in the book Revelation 5 the book had names yes the book comes down in Revelation 10 so the one who has the book now it's consumed the bright as the Revelation amen of what he once done with the word and she must now call the rest of the names in the book that's our prophecy amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated I want to get to Luke 4 and: 16 I want to show you amen what our lord Jesus did praise the Lord amen because the prophet teaches us clearly that everything that Jesus did his bridled be the same amen bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit he even tells us that your ministry will be a greater portion a double portion when he's talking about the bride amen so yeah in uh Amen in in Luke 4:16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read so we also come to church on a Sunday and we also stand for the reading of the word amen praise the Lord and notice it was his custom so don't come to church when you please amen if the Lord Jesus made it his custom to go to church church amen it ought to be our custom as well and there was delivered unto him the book now we just showed you in Revelation 10 John is delivered a book amen and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written and the Lord Jesus does this he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me now can you imagine the room all the scribes the Pharisees he entered now the temple they hand Jesus the book All Eyes Are Fixed On Jesus they know he's The Miracle Worker they know this man amen is working the miraculous so when he goes to the scripture what scripture will he go to he's got the room riveted All Eyes Are Fixed On Jesus amen and he reads the scripture the spirit of the Lord is upon me and he reads it with such Authority amen because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor amen he had send me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind Amen to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable hear of the Lord amen now the prophecy continues but Jesus stops Midway of the prophecy amen and he says and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and all the eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him they were amazed that this man spoke with authority and can you imagine the conversations in the room he read that scripture like it was about him and he read it with such Authority that it became a reality it it almost felt like that scripture was meant for him remember in that room now Faith come by the hearing so all eyes are fastened on Jesus he reads it with such Authority that he brings the scripture to life asai wrote about this time when he would take that book and then some of the scribes and some of the Pharisees started a rumor and listen he says and they began to say unto him this day oh sorry he says this day the scriptures fulfilled and all be witness and wondered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and then comes the unbelief is not this Joseph's son they shook themselves oh yes what were we thinking we almost thought that was a messiah but you see when a word he sown listen to that verse before that they listen to the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth but then Devil comes to S unbelief it's not this Joseph son amen praise the Lord amen so my point there when you read Isaiah 60 if you can put up Isaiah 60 Jesus stops Midway because there's a portion of ministry left for an end time people amen that starts with a prophetic gift amen amen but son of man doesn't stop in a prophet son of man continues all the way in a people amen when Christ is revealed in his word to a people that his son of man minister be continuing we'll read the quote just now amen but I want to show you in Isaiah 60:1 Jesus stops at verse two Midway you find that he says amen sorry 61 612 he stops Midway to proclaim the acceptable of the Lord but it continues and the day of the Vengeance of our God that day of vengeance is happening in Revelation 10 because Revelation 10 Christ is not descending the mighty Angel is not descending to come for a picnic that's right the battle is hot and heavy amen the beast on the earth Beast coming from the land Beast coming from the sea therefore the mighty Angel descends and he puts one foot on the land one foot on the sea he's coming in a time of War amen when all hell is let loose upon the Earth read the the fourth seal all hell is following this Rider called death 200 million demons have been let loose upon the Earth amen but the mighty Angel descends right with a shout amen amen he's coming to bring a protection over God's people because they must receive the word amen hallelujah so here you find the day of Vengeance of God is happening in Revelation 10 it's a time of investigating judgment it's like genesis 18 there amen it's a time of investigating judgment because the cross is gone up to God and man's heart is continually evil amen hallelujah so you find here to comfort all that mourn that Ministry is for Son of Man when he comes back to the Earth that's in operation now this is the bridal Ministry to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion and to give unto them Beauty for Ashes Hallelujah the oil of joy for mourning amen the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified but where is she getting this oil where is she getting this wine to give off amen amen can you see her Ministry she's bringing beautiful ashes it's not her doing it it's Christ in her amen you read Colossians 3 amen hallelujah you find amen it's not no longer I I died in Christ Christ now lives in me Galatians 2:20 the life that I now live is not my own but I live amen by the faith of the Son of God so they have oil of joy for mourning Garment of Praise Spirit of heaviness they might be called the Trees of Righteousness amen if you go to uh Joel chapter 2 amen I want to want to show you where they getting it from where do they have this oil where are they getting this wine from where are they getting this is excess now remember you can only give off if you have overflow hallelujah amen if your oil is running low you're going to be like the foolish virgins running off at Midnight Cry trying to find some oil but the wise virgins have enough they even have a reserve tank amen amen they've got an overflow they've got unap resources amen nothing is W from you at this time and season God has released it all to the bride amen hallelujah yeah in Joel chapter 2 hear the trumpet sound amen it's a jubilee trumpet he says blow he the trumpet in Zion sound the alarm on my Holy Mountain let the all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the Lord cometh for it is n at hand that's the day of Vengeance amen drop down to verse 19 there y the Lord will answer and say unto his people behold I will send you corn and wine and oil God is giving it to us right amen that's why she has this abundance amen and you shall be satisfied there would and I will no more make you a reproach among the Eden among the denominations amen hallelujah but I will remove you far off from that Northern Army we've been speaking about that Northern army that army that's coming to make a move on the sides of the north amen Satan's ambition I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation on the sides of the North so there's an invading Army Satan and his army invading the sides of the north because strategically in the Heavenly realm the bride is situated on the sides of the north beautiful for situation the joy of the old Earth is Mount Zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king we've got to know where we are positionally placed in the kingdom of God amen hallelujah amen we showed you how Dan was was positioned on the sides of the north that's the eagle anointing right praise the Lord so there's an army but God is saying I will remove that Northern Army that's coming to you and will drive him into a land Barren and desolate with his face towards the east sea and he Z A Part toward the utmost sea and his stink shall come up and Ill Savor shall come up but because he had done great things fear not Oh Land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great great things Be not Afraid ye beast of the field for the pastures of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beareth the fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do heal their strength be glad watch How It's coming now you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord for your God for he had given you the former rain moderately amen and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month Hallelujah in this time and season amen we have both the former rain and the latter rain amen verse 24 and the floors shall be full of wheat so after rain comes and harvest yes this is showing you past the hours time the floor will be full of Wheat and not only that the fats shall overflow with what come on now I'm living in the Overflow amen hallelujah did reveal it there amen under the third seal he's talking about the stimulation of Revelation amen and he's talking about the oil and the wine amen you'll hear how excited brother Brandon gets when you listen to that message and he starts to talk about stimulation of Revelation and the Holy Ghost being poured out but it is not being poured out sparingly to the Bride of Jesus Christ it is being poured out in an overflow it's in an abundance amen because as much as you receive you can give off amen this bride as a Ministry she is sounding a trumpet amen praise the lord it's the bride's Jubilee trumpet being sounded in the days of our prophecy therefore we can set the captives free we can heal the sick amen we can restore Liberty to them that are bound amen now remember all things of God must be believed by faith and even that he says your salvation you've got to believe by faith your healing you've got to believe by faith if you've got to believe in this time and season that you have a Ministry you've got to believe that God has called you am praise the Lord amen God bless you Sister K amen and I will restore to you the amen so here we're going to find the years that the Locust had eaten the canker worm caterpillar Palmer worm my great Army which i s amongst you and you shall eat in plenty I tell you somebody's been eating in plenty oh there's salvation out there there's famine out there amen but somebody has been eating in plenty because we've had a Joseph amen who knew how to store Amen in the time of increase so in the time of famine amen we can have food amen and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that had dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed amen this is a quote I was telling you about amen read it carefully now because this is a portion of your ministry he says then Jesus says As it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church not no more the bride is called yes in the days of the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head amen the marriage of the Bride right the bridegroom call will come right through this amen amen when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together amen Lord but does it stop there the bridegroom call came through the prophetic gift don't stop there though he goes on the church has to be the word come on now he's not saying the church has to receive the word he's not saying the church has to hear the word he's saying the church has to be the word amen we are not just satisfied listening to the word we want to manifest all that the word says about us we must take the book and find where it is written of us amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unite together so it can only be word uniting with word the only way that you can be a part the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ if you were in the predestinated thoughts of God Amen if you came from the sight of the Lord Jesus Christ and if you did I how about we give him a good of Praise how come amen we can't shout how come we can't dance how come we can't Rejoice about those things amen and don't let me try and crank you up to give God praise amen you are to be rejoicing in the house of the Lord because of What the Lord Has Done amen it seems like when things are given too easy and you receive things tooo easy you have nothing to shout about you need to check your experience amen because the Son and Daughter of God the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ has made uself ready it's not a once of Readiness but it's a daily Readiness it's a hour by hour Readiness it's a minute by minute Readiness amen because God is updating amen his plan as he goes along amen because Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God amen amen hallelujah how are you being led amen how are you being led are the only instructions you're receiving are from your boss do this do this do this do this how about listening to the Holy Ghost the one who was sent to lead and guide the church the one who was sent amen God has sent the spirit of his son two sons amen when will we mature in the kingdom of God when will we mature in the things of God we want to track our growth every other time for every other thing we want to track our bank balance we want to track our promotion we want to track our career here we want to track amen amen our Our dating life maybe you want to track your I don't know what you want to track but you track every other thing but when it comes to tracking your spiritual growth I tell you there is no tracking there Lord yes people are not seeing I I was so much in faith because faith is measurable Jesus said oh he have little faith and then he said I've never seen such great faith so faith is miserable and when the Lord Jesus Christ said when I come back will I find faith on the Earth again we know that this kind of faith is no ordinary Faith hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen this kind of Faith it's a prophetic Ministry of love that's the Bright's prophecy a prophetic Ministry of Love charity producing the faith substance of things hopeful charity is producing the faith substance of things hopeful amen praise the Lord amen we need to continue the quote the church has to be the word turn to your neighbor and say we have to be the word to the word no negotiations we can't come short of there amen you know what happens when you don't become the word you'll be standing and waving to people going in a Rapture you can pick up their clothes praise the Lord so it's a must amen the Holy Ghost is a must amen the Dynamics of this church is a refilling of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah we got the Holy Ghost how come you can listen to worldly music how come you can watch all these movies how come you can watch all these men amen with shorts running around the ground kicking a pig skin and you are celebrating them and cheering but in the house of the Lord my God not even that your lips don't even move the hands don't even move amen you get more excited when the guy missed the goal everyone in the house must feel the effect of your [Music] wrath and then again when they kick the goal inside the net everyone in the house must listen to you screaming and shouting well you came in our territory this morning you're going to hear Scream and Shout amen we're going to let go of every demon power amen and even a demon spirit that possessed you the sucker spirits and this this sport spirits and this gambling spirits and this alcohol spirits and this drug addiction Spirit we bind it even now in the name of Jesus you can't be so backslid all these years in the message of the hour when are you going to stand up and be a man when are you going to stand up and be counted for the things of God Amen now the only ones that will get offended to that is the one that's found in that position the rest will be rejoicing praise the Lord preach it brother amen but the one that's found in that condition can't wait for me to finish and the col is getting hot now they loosening their ties amen praise the Lord how about we say Satan get the behind me amen yes you help me bound too long yes Lord amen Deliverance has come this morning see what he says now the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man amen it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that he will unite the church and him as one the bride then she'll go home to the wedding supper she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not the marriage but the Rapture is going to be is going to the waiting supper when the word year unites with the person when the two become one I'm so glad brother brand doesn't say when the word unites with the church because this is not a group saving with the person amen praise the Lord Christ is coming to personalize himself with you hallelujah praise the Lord the two become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again amen amen so when he comes into you the person what is the prophet say it manifests who again amen that's in the message proving his word it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing hallelujah oh hallelujah how about we get some better amen than that what does he say here amen whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing amen you didn't get my notes brother that's why you're looking amen sorry praise the Lord thank you Lord whatever so I want to reiterate this when the two becomes one it manifest the son of man again amen not the church theologians the son of man the word in the church becomes one whatever the son of man done whatever Jesus did he was the word the church does the same thing amen Hallelujah so we can't be lacking in any area of our life amen Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me and and and the husband releases that to the wife amen uh amen what's his name Esther's husband King hus released half the kingdom to his wife oh yes praise the Lord Leviticus 25:8 if we read that praise the Lord everybody feeling good we're speaking this morning amen just to remind you on the bride's Jubilee trumpet in the days of our prophecy amen now you know it's Jubilee trumpet is to set the captives free amen we just read amen the second part of Isaiah 61 there what our ministry entails and then we showed you how we got the oil and the wine and the Overflow in Joel chapter 2 We are following a train of thought amen amen praise the Lord and then we were showing our Lord Jesus Christ how he operated amen and the son of man being revealed in us again hallelujah praise the Lord so Leviticus chapter 25 and verse 8 praise the Lord says here and thou shal number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40 and9 years then shall thou cause the trumpet of Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month amen yes Lord amen that is not there by chance you cause it a sound on the 10th day of the seventh month amen you can put up Revelation 10:7 there hallelujah hallelujah while we on this point you'll see the prophet is coming in Revelation 10:7 yes but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound it's a jubilee trumpet being sounded the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets amen praise the Lord amen amen we can go back Leviticus 25:8 amen praise the Lord hallelujah [Music] amen then there shall th cause the trumpet of Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall he make the trumpet sound throughout all your land to All Nations tribes tongues Kings and you shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all your land and to all inhabitants therefore it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family a jubilee shall that 50th year be unto you you shall not sow neither reap that which growth of itself in it neither gather the grapes in it of thy Vine undressed you see in the 50th year it's a land of abundance and Jubilee so sister venessa should be looking forward to the 50th year amen because it's a land of increase where God Is providing in abundance and overflow thank you Lord amen because when when trumpet is s remember the guy was a slave he's got nothing to go to so who must provide God must provide he's not being building up wealth all these years he was imprisoned he was he lost his possession but in the 50th year when the trumpet of Jubilee sounds amen he can go free back to his possession meaning there is a provision made for him praise the Lord amen for it shall be a jubilee and it shall be holy unto you you shall eat in the increase thereof out of the field you see the provision is there in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession and if Thou shalt sell ought to Thy Neighbor or buyest or of thy neighbor's hand you shall not oppress one another according to the number of years after the Jubilee Thou shalt buy of thy neighbor and according unto the number of years of the fruit he shall sell unto thee praise the Lord so I want you to know as well there's a another side to that story if a man refuses to hear the trumpet yes yes yes amen if he refuses to hear the proclamation of emancipation he must be taken to the temple you know we read that scripture the last time the man must be taken that's right now remember when they rejected Jesus ministry what year did Peter strike of the I PRI servant sorry left here struck his right here why Jesus ministry had been rejected so they rejected the sounding of Jubilee trumpet so the year must be not praise the Lord amen so if the bride is having a prophetic Ministry the Bible says take him in a public place take him to the door yes take him to the door yes and let let all be pushed through his ear so if Jesus ministry was was was rejected and the I PRI servants here were struck when the bride's Ministry is rejected take the man to Butler Pennsylvania a butler is the one who answers the door take him to the door amen we've been through this message before as soon as it happened amen the Holy Spirit picked it up he brought it to the church amen Trump was marked in the air not the woman the man was marked in the air why the brides sign that the bride's message has been rejected and after the rejection now comes the judgments of God amen amen take the man and Mark him in the air praise the Lord but that's for whosoever will believe praise the Lord so we know that F year is a jubilee the word Pentecost means Jubilee Praise the Lord he says that the going forth of the Jubilee sounded throughout all the lands a trumpet was to sound and the trumpet would make the distinction so a trumpet has to make a distinct sound yes amen amen I didn't respond when or Roberts was preaching I didn't respond when Billy Graham was preaching I didn't respond when a Helen was preaching but when William grham started to blow his trumpet something in my soul responded to that word amen amen and I keep listening for a different sound am oh yeah why he had the call of the bridegroom we just read the quote the bridegroom's call will come by the prophet Hallelujah can't you hear your theophany calling you amen I didn't respond to any TG Jakes amen amen amen I didn't respond to Joel o Ste I didn't respond Amen to Joseph amen what's his name the grace Minister Prince Joseph Prince amen but I responded Amen to a prophetic gift huah an unparallel gift even now they are mesmerized by the gift even as recent as amen you'll find even weekly clips are going by how they study the life and Ministry and they see this ministry is unparalleled because it wasn't a human Ministry it was a son of man being revealed amen that's right praise the Lord hallelujah it was no ordinary Ministry and we showed you how they marveled at William bram's Faith but they didn't know there was a driving force behind that faith it was love producing the faith he says every time I was on the platform and before any healing there was a great presence and the Holy Spirit came over me that great love Spirit now if it operated in him how many of you know it must operate in you oh I'm not just saying that randomly Hallelujah the great love Spirit has to come amongst us praise the Lord put up love spirit amen as a perfect match there love Spirit watch now what we've been building up for months and years now is going to culminate in this amen amen while we here I want to show you this amen that this is what the bride is contending for yes sir amen it should be just one day if you got a love spirit amen don't put it as a white search just put it as exact search praise the Lord I wasn't going to bring this today but amen if the spirit is bringing it out we want to get it amen amen you've got four tell me what it is I can't hear you the next one I'll find it for you now amen how if you love the Lord amen amen I want to show you that brother Bram says his love Spirit came over him and I want to show you he's prophesying it over a people and when this happens it's it's not going to be the efforts of any man this is what we actually contending for and waiting for amen praise the Lord [Music] God keeps his word amen now that's the message but he does keep his word listen to what he says here go up right he says I believe it's coming to a time where let's just go from from 215 I want to want you to get this wheel good it don't matter if we don't finish a service today amen let's just get certain things let's crystallize certain points 215 want to tell you what happens this last week we've had some of the most marvelous things happen in the meeting CU at the platform and I have coming into type of something you see I'm coming into a type of something that it just seems to be greater than than what it was hey I want that I have come to the platform and God has given a gift a prophetic gift that's beyond question I can prove it to you right here that's beyond question but I see just doesn't get the job done the way it should oh interesting I love this because the prophet is teaching me how to operate because it's just a gift see the prophet is going to tell us now he's going to go this thing is going to be something past a gift right another thing it's an individual you see it pertains to an individual through a gift but I done something the other day tried to get the people in Oakland just to wear in a big arena just his presence and just stayed right with that word and got the people you know what there was more healing than I believe I've ever seen in anyone meeting taking place outside of the big meetings like in Africa and around like that but for its size the people people just recognizing the presence of God you see why we can't sit in the service and his presence go unrecognized we are not interested in the service we don't say an amen in fact some of us are almost 40 years and we've never said an amen the people recognizing the presence of God in the meeting just sitting there getting in the presence of God and the people would get up healed crosseyed straightened now here what he says I believe it's coming to a time where Paul said where there's prophecies it shall fail he's in 1 Corinthians 13 now have we been dealing with 1 Corinthians 13 where there tongues they shall cease I believe it's coming to a time till when the saints will get together like this and just a love spirit will sweep over the audience what will happen then brother Brandon and just every person in there all that's wrong will be taken out it'll be such a presence of the Holy Spirit I believe while we've to lay hands on them and pray for them now it's a contact maybe of a minister anointed and laying hands on just a blessing to God but I believe it's coming a time when God's church is going to be so called out like that where the Saints will sit together and the Holy Spirit will just come in just woo just like it was on the day of Pentecost and just heal the people and raise up the people great things I begin to see it happen and if you are looking for that and if you are contending for that where the Holy Spirit swis through the place Lord you're not looking up to a man you're not looking to the gift but you recognize who you are because I tell you why men has went forth with gifts that's true I have no doubt to say I'm not being a Critic of anyone what they believe that's up to them I've seen men with gifted Ministries they went forth more or less but what would would I say with respects and with love God knows it's from my heart they have made more like a money Gathering Affair out of it you see just get the people together put them in a big something money out praise the Lord so just so you know as your pastor that's what I'm preaching you to oh thank you Lord that's the faith we are building too where you can receive the Holy Ghost sweep through the building that's why you got to be reverent Hallelujah in a service Hallelujah because you can distract the Holy Spirit Hallelujah you can even miss it the prophet of God will say woman I saw the light over your head there and then stop again and say oh he's gone you missed it yes sir why irreverence unable to recognize the presence of God am when it is being manifest amen hallelujah praise the Lord so we were talking about amen this great Jubilee Ministry that the bride has a Ministry to set the captives free a Ministry amen of oil and wine who did the foolish virgins go to to look for oil amen but it was the ministry of the Bride to tell I can't give it to you amen this is not an impartation the Holy Ghost can't come in in this measure and in this form where I have oil in my lamp and I have oil in my vessel it came with a price it came with a consecration it came amen with too much amen that I had to sacrifice in this life I can't just give it to you you've got to go to them that sell it it's also a journey a walk a Enoch walk hallelujah amen this shouldn't just come overnight sir you are trying to dispossess me of my oil but I can't give it to you you've got to protect the oil amen the ministry of love is not just one that gives without knowing what he wants done with the word she knows what he wants done with the word and she knows what she can give and what she can't give yes yes it's a Ministry of love it's a prophetic Ministry but she can't give it go read Matthew 25 she can't give it that's right you have to go yourself and go and seek the angel of the Lord go and seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know what it works because they came back with oil and they came looking for the ones that had oil but they got it too late so when people are preaching that the Holy Ghost is cut off they're not talking the truth that's right the Holy Ghost was poured out right until the time the bride was taken off the Earth that's what the prophet says says when the hly when the bride leaves the Holy Ghost goes because it must go to the Jews praise the Lord so my plea to you is you can still get the Holy Ghost but don't get it too late amen amen praise the Lord so when I'm talking about a distinction 107 was a distinct sound 10 7 was [Music] unmissable and can I say this 107 is [Music] Unstoppable you can't stop it no matter how many critics rise how many dating and chors Rise God will have children God will raise up children that will believe that message praise the Lord amen he says here in the message isza Jubilee the devil has got our church all cold formal indifferent what we need is a calling back what we need is an oldfashioned Gathering Together the sounding of Jubilee the pouring forth of the Holy Ghost outcoming of the spirit that calls us to come back to prayer meeting I'm inviting all of you to come back to prayer meeting Wednesday night prayer meeting amen I'm inviting all of you to come back to prayer meeting thank hallelujah praise the Lord amen we've been there to the next one in Seal of God how he was taken amen so if you don't get sealed by God the devil will seal your ear the prophet here in the mark of the beast he says but you reject the truth and the devil seals your ear and if your ear is sealed you don't hear it anymore meaning you'll be you'll be hearing people telling you things but you can't hear them you know that sometimes what happens you know when the husband is talking to the wife and her mind is preoccupied I'm not saying it the other way because a men will get in trouble I'm saying it the other way you know and the and the okay the men are guilty of this I'm say it that way when the wife is talking to the man but the mind is man is thinking something else and he's he can hear a voice coming through but it's like a far distance he's thinking something else then she must remind him can you hear what I'm saying come back to earth yes I heard what you said I'll deposit the money praise the Lord so you don't hear anymore oh nonsense I don't believe that stuff my pastor never told us that first line of defense my pastor didn't tell me this no my I come from the line of JF rolands you mean God revealed this to JF to reveal it to Y he didn't reveal it to JF rolands God is Not respector of persons sir Hallelujah he didn't go and reveal it to the priests and the Pharisees and all of those things he bypassed all of them yes sir you mean Jesus Dome got bypassed what's his name Fred Roberts but Fred Roberts had a lot of respect you told me that amen one time brother Joshua was there and a man was talking negative about brother brandham and he says Fred Roberts came up after that and corrected the man praise the Lord because these men knew the gift you could hear over Angel talk about William grham he say people have not done a fraction of William grham did he said they should not even utter his name they should be ashamed to utter his name but they want to talk all kind of things what are we saying we are showing you a Ministry out of the Bible Revelation 10:7 am Malachi 4:5 and 6 a Ministry out of the Bible praise the Lord amen as we bring this to a close now we know that the Prodigal Son responded to a jubilee trumpet you say there was no trumpet sounding no there was a trumpet sounding in his heart that's right amen it was the work of the Holy Ghost amen the the trumpet was sounding it was a call to adoption yes yes it was a return to Father's House a call to adoption the Holy Spirit was working on him and at the appointed time he couldn't help out respond amen yeah the prophet says father be merciful to me like the prodical son that returned to the father and we sure that he will meet him halfway down the road there's going to be a meeting in the air and kiss him on the neck all of this is signs of adoption if you don't know if you read about adoption these are signs of adoption kiss him on the neck put a ring on the finger robe on him bringing him in Kill the fatted calf and a great Jubilee there'll be that in that broken home God's restoring broken homes amen you've got to believe for your family you've got to believe for your loved ones you've got to believe for your wife for your husband for your children you've got to believe it amen haty right here to believe it Ana had to believe it the Mexican woman with a dead baby had to believe it I want you to know God won't do the supernatural what's intended for you without you being present what's meant for you God will call you on the scene when Martha was sitting in the house of the morning and was going to miss the miracle God sent Martha to Mary sorry Mary was sitting in the house of the MERS but God meant for her to witness a miracle Hallelujah God meant for her to be part of the Supernatural and Mar goes to Mary the master has come and he call for thee don't be stubborn when he's calling you leave the house of mourning leave the house of depression leave the house of sickness leave the house of lack leave the house of unemployment God is calling you this morning hallelujah thank you Lord Mary obeyed the voice of Martha and she came you see sometimes you won't always hear the voice of Jesus sometimes it will come in the form of Martha sir sometimes it will come in the form of your brother and sister but to reject their voice is to reject Jesus call yes if Mary said oh Martha please leave me alone I'm grieving too much but at the appointed time this bride is called to witness the resurrection of the sleeping Saints hallelujah hallelujah amen I shall be there when that Mighty Angel amen hallelujah the voice of the Archangel the voice of the Resurrection shall call all the Sleeping Saints praise the Lord so he responded the prodal son amen you'll find amen there in you can read it in Genesis 4:14 amen you you find there amen Ela sounding Jubilee trumpet to Rebecca telling her things she never heard before telling her about a man she never heard before telling about Abraham telling about Isaac telling about all the goods she never seen that country before she never seen that that that kind of people before but something in her heart responded to Jubilee trumpet call hallelujah amen remember the bride makes herself ready there's a portion for the bride to do you can't be sitting in your house and doing nothing and saying I'm making myself ready no that's not making yourself ready making yourself ready you go find them Rebecca fulfills an Unwritten part of the scripture she knew nothing about because El are told when I ask for a drink she must give me a drink that's the only part that will be spoken you won't ask her to feed the camels Wednesday we speaking about Waters and Waters of Separation amen you'll see she goes to taking water and the prophet says that Beast represents a power the power that was going to pack her back to Isaac she was feeding it with water washed By the Waters of the word she was feeding it back with the word back with the word giving it strength because amen any any supernatural being can only be fed with the word so she had to feed the beast back the Waters of the word Waters of the word Waters of the word then you find amen she's making herself ready and when they ask her will you go with this man she must make a decision the family can't make the decision for you your mother father can't make the decision for you yes amen you've got to make the decision for yourself and to respond to Jubilee trumpet she said I will go then even when she goes on the journey she doesn't go unguided El is with her every step of the way when she sees him in the field she asks Ela because the bride under a messenger amen who is that man in the field is he the one we've got to know who we are uniting with because Satan can come as an angel of Light but we've got to know the scriptural identification of how he will reveal himself otherwise you'll find yourself in some denomination he told us how Christ is being revealed he told us where he chosen place of worship is he had clearly marked out and identified his place where he put his name so that we won't be confused Who's Isaac connect with Isaac and then you find she still makes herself ready she takes a veil and covers herself and goes towards Isaac amen I believe that's the portion where the bride is now she's veiled gone into with Isaac into the tent into Sarah's tent amen and there she became his wife praise the Lord amen you had to finish off now amen Rea was trapped in Jericho without a future and a hope you know I love things about children of God they learn they don't make the same mistakes twice you see when Moses first sent spies he sent 10 spies how many spies he sent 10 spies was it 10 or was it 12 was it 10 10 spies right you don't they don't make the same mistake again second time they send spies how many they send two tell your neighbor learn from your mistakes the first time you took unbelievers with you second time don't take unbelievers [Music] amen yes if you make the same mistake twice you to blame because the other guys said there's Giants in the land we're not evil so Joshua a type of the Holy Ghost learns hey send true send Faith and love let them give RAB Hope come on give God a good an of Praise amen and six days they hear the trumpet sound once on the seventh day she's hearing the trumpet sound and the walls come down and re goes free because she responds to the trumpets Mori sounded the trumpet for Esther she was she was Queen in a position but she wasn't able to function as Queen you see you can be in the message and not functioning as bride not functioning as wife you in the palace but got no access to the king yes sir and if you watch how the story is portrayed Modi is not able to have direct communication with Esther he's like in another place he's like in another dimension like our Prophet is now in another dimension but there is one can go forth his name is ACH atch is the one the fivefold ministry that is now having communication with Esther so it's between atch and Esther that messages are going P between these two Hallelujah amen that's why the fivefold ministry must be faithful Faithfully taught to say only what the prophet says amen because passing important message to the queen praise the Lord so my point is you can be in the kingdom and be shut off from the presence of the king no access no relationship and living like that saying I'm in fear of the king because if he said if anyone comes into the presence Uninvited can be killed but the word straightens [Music] outu the word of Mori stens are out don't think your life will be spared don't think you're automatically going to make the Rapture who knows you were kept aside for such a time as this who knows you were called for such a time as this a prophetic Ministry of Love producing the faith substance of things hopeful amen the bride has a Ministry Revelation 10:11 is our ministry we can't be idle with that Ministry if you watch what Esther did after that once she gets into the presence of the king once a royal scepter is raised to her and once she's given to even to after the kingdom this woman goes to work making herself ready starts to organize a feast and starts to command the king and uh his name amen come to the feast they all start dancing to her tune she becomes a final Authority there oh come on now listen she becomes a final Authority she makes a feast she calls them summons the king amen summons Amon you'll find even when Aon is dead the law is already written that on a certain date yes sir they're going to kill all the Jews [Music] but Esther starts to she gets the king Signet she gets his seal the king gives it to them and modah and they start to rewrite the lawen this bride shall write another book of Acts this bride shall rewrite everything that the devil has planned for you there's God's plans and the devil's plans you've got to rewrite your plan stops today [Music] Esther had to rewrite on a certain certain date they were going to come against this Northern Army was going to come against them and kill all the Jews but Esther rewrote the law the king said what I have written I have written I can't change it but you you see the king put it back in her hand the king couldn't change his own word the King has now put the book in your hand amen if you read Revelation 10 yes the book is back in your hand what are you going to do with it let's stand together give the Lord a good ank of Praise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
