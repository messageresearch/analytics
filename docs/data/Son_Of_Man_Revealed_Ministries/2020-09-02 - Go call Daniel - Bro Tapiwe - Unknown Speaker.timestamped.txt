[25:41] amen
[25:44] amen i'm not going to take much of your
[25:47] time
[25:49] my words as a man they come to nothing
[26:00] i wonder if we have got our bibles to
[26:02] turn to the book of
[26:03] daniel chapter 2.
[26:24] i will read verse 9
[26:32] but if you will not make known unto me
[26:35] the dream
[26:38] there is but one decree for you
[26:42] for you have prepared lying and corrupt
[26:44] words
[26:45] to speak before me till the time
[26:48] be changed therefore
[26:52] tell me the dream and i shall know that
[26:55] you can show me
[26:57] the interpretation thereof
[27:00] may the lord bless the region of israel
[27:02] you can check yourself
[27:09] i just formulated the subject here
[27:13] [Music]
[27:16] which are entitled go and call daniel
[27:23] there are wonderful things that our
[27:25] prophet actually
[27:26] speaks about where
[27:30] the scene is opening tonight
[27:34] in a city called babylon
[27:37] brother branham says babylon is found
[27:41] at the beginning of the bible that is in
[27:43] the book of genesis
[27:46] babylon is found in the middle part of
[27:48] the bible
[27:50] that is where we just opened in the book
[27:52] of daniel amen
[27:53] babylon is also found at the end
[27:57] amen amen in the book of revelation
[28:00] where we see the mystery babylon
[28:04] why babylon found in the book of genesis
[28:08] the prophet says the devil has got a
[28:12] beginning
[28:15] there is somewhere where he started and
[28:18] there is somewhere where he is going to
[28:19] come to an end
[28:20] [Music]
[28:23] so we are not we are not shocked about
[28:26] this
[28:28] that's why we are not supposed to fear
[28:30] the devil amen
[28:33] because he has got an end amen but
[28:36] the god that we are serving
[28:40] brother sister is ominous omnipresent
[28:46] amen the one who does not have a
[28:49] beginning
[28:50] the one who does not have an end
[28:53] so in other words babylon is found
[28:57] in the whole bible that's what the
[29:00] prophet says
[29:03] so tonight
[29:06] we are seeing something strange taking
[29:09] place
[29:10] in babylon
[29:14] the king nebuchadnezzar
[29:17] he had wise men
[29:20] whom he had grouped
[29:23] some called sorcerers others in the
[29:27] group of astrologers
[29:30] some the charities
[29:33] and others the magicians
[29:37] all these four groups they were the wise
[29:41] men
[29:42] who could come and yes certain words
[29:46] to the king but i want you to understand
[29:50] one thing tonight
[29:52] they were always telling the king lies
[29:57] amen you know you can lie
[30:02] and go on with a lie but let me tell you
[30:06] something
[30:08] it won't go forever
[30:11] one day it will come to an end amen
[30:16] so this is exactly what we are seeing
[30:20] where an advocate nasa he had a dream
[30:25] and he does not come to tell his wise
[30:27] man
[30:28] instead he wanted them to tell him
[30:31] what he dreamt then you would know they
[30:36] are going to interpret
[30:41] i'm so happy with what the wise men
[30:44] actually said
[30:45] to the king
[30:48] they said there is no king who ever
[30:51] requested
[30:52] such an impossible thing
[30:55] from his wise man
[30:57] [Music]
[30:59] it was an impossible thing to them
[31:02] you know what i'm saying
[31:05] but in the middle of such things
[31:09] there is a prophet who was sent by god
[31:12] amen in the headquarters of the devil
[31:17] there was a prophet who was not
[31:19] recognized
[31:23] who was not even in the category of
[31:24] these wise men
[31:30] amen
[31:32] when they had been stranded to the
[31:34] extremes
[31:35] [Music]
[31:37] they remembered that there is a prophet
[31:41] in a babylon
[31:45] so there is a man ariel who was sent
[31:48] to go and inquest
[31:51] from daniel
[31:56] and you know the whole story daniel was
[31:59] in a position
[32:00] to come and speak to the king
[32:03] and tell him what he dreamt
[32:07] so there are wonderful things that i'm
[32:09] going to
[32:11] tell you about because it stretches to
[32:13] our day
[32:14] where we are living brother branham says
[32:19] it was divided into five governments
[32:22] that image which king nebuchadnezzar
[32:26] dreamt of
[32:31] the head of god
[32:38] the arms and the breasts
[32:41] of silver
[32:44] then we come to the belly which was of
[32:48] brass then we come to the legs
[32:54] which were of iron then lastly the fifth
[32:58] government which was defeat
[33:03] where there was iron and a clay
[33:07] that could not mingle together
[33:10] you know what i'm saying so i'm not
[33:14] going to be speaking about the other
[33:15] four governments
[33:17] because they came to pass yes amen
[33:20] i'm going to talk about what i have
[33:22] witnessed in my day
[33:24] that i am living with what the prophet
[33:25] has said
[33:27] that is the fifth government yes iron
[33:30] and clay that cannot mingle together
[33:35] brother branham says in 1956
[33:41] when they gathered at united nations for
[33:43] a summit
[33:47] there were two leaders one representing
[33:51] the east
[33:53] the other one representing the west
[33:57] the east were being represented
[34:00] by a russian prime minister by the name
[34:03] nikita crusher
[34:07] in the crucifer in russian language
[34:11] it means clay
[34:16] the west was being represented by united
[34:19] states
[34:20] president by the name dwight essentia
[34:26] it means amen
[34:30] brother branham says
[34:33] the meeting was ongoing they could not
[34:37] agree
[34:41] to such an extent that a crew chef
[34:46] took out his shoe and he beat the table
[34:51] there was nothing else that he could see
[34:54] which he was going to use
[34:56] to build the table he did not use a
[34:59] hammer
[35:00] he did not use a book he used
[35:03] a shoe why a shoe
[35:07] we are talking about iron and clay
[35:11] that are not mingling together right at
[35:13] the feet
[35:16] you know what i'm saying yes amen
[35:19] i want you to i want to draw your
[35:21] attention
[35:28] 1999.
[35:30] russia invaded the chechnya
[35:35] remember what russia was trying to do
[35:38] was trying to
[35:39] claim all those states which used it to
[35:42] be a soviet union
[35:44] to become russia
[35:47] you understand so 1999
[35:51] russia invaded the chechnya
[35:55] and the prime minister of
[35:58] the president of america by the name
[36:00] billy clinton on that time
[36:03] he actually stated that russia was
[36:05] supposed to withdraw their troops
[36:07] from chechnya
[36:11] and the prime minister of russia by the
[36:14] name boris your team
[36:17] he answered billy clinton by saying
[36:22] russia is not going to withdraw their
[36:24] troops from chechnya
[36:26] if you want to see who russia is let us
[36:29] meet in chechnya
[36:32] brother sister why am i talking about
[36:34] this
[36:36] we are eyewitnesses we are just
[36:40] seeing what the prophet actually said
[36:42] coming to pass
[36:44] right no matter how small
[36:48] the political issue is russia america
[36:51] they are not coming to me all together
[36:55] they are not in agreement terms you
[36:58] change the president you change the
[36:59] prime ministers
[37:00] but still they are not agreeing
[37:04] remember 1956 it was a crucifix
[37:08] now 1999 we have got billy clinton
[37:11] and buddhism thing but still they are
[37:13] not agreeing
[37:16] why is this going on like that amen
[37:20] that's why we had a prophet in our day
[37:23] you remember the vision that you saw
[37:27] 1933 watch russia
[37:31] watch russia keep your focus on the king
[37:34] of the north
[37:37] they are not agreeing
[37:40] 30 december 2006
[37:43] [Music]
[37:45] you know that saddam hussein was
[37:46] executed by america
[37:51] prior to the execution of saddam hussein
[37:55] there was only one country
[37:58] that refused to join america
[38:02] to go against saddam hussein in baghdad
[38:06] it was russia
[38:10] you know what i'm saying they are not
[38:13] agreeing
[38:14] i read one newspaper in swaziland that
[38:17] time
[38:20] in the world news and it was saying
[38:24] russia was a peace supporting
[38:27] iraq by sending arms and ammunition
[38:34] my point is
[38:37] this had nothing to do with russia
[38:40] and this had nothing to do with america
[38:45] but why russia and america
[38:49] could not actually mingle together no
[38:52] matter how small the issue was
[38:56] claim in the island that could not
[39:00] mingle together
[39:02] you know what i'm saying
[39:08] can i just read you a quote
[39:15] um seven church edges
[39:40] page 237
[39:48] the prophet says
[39:51] let me give you a little something on
[39:54] the iron
[39:55] and clay remember when crusher
[39:58] beat his shoe on the desk at the united
[40:01] nations
[40:02] that is 1956 well
[40:06] there were five eastern nations
[40:09] and the five question khrushchev spoke
[40:12] for the east
[40:13] and the present sn1 for the west
[40:16] in the russian language khrushchev is
[40:19] clay
[40:20] and the sn-1 means iron
[40:24] the two main leaders of the world the
[40:26] two
[40:27] big doors of the fit of iron
[40:30] and clay we are side by side
[40:34] we are in the end of it all
[40:41] then he goes on to say who is able to
[40:44] make war with the beast
[40:46] now there are a present some great names
[40:50] in the world
[40:52] there are some mighty nations but right
[40:55] now
[40:56] rome is calling
[41:00] the tune the pope is on the driver's
[41:03] seat
[41:04] and his power is going to increase
[41:07] no one can make war against him
[41:16] russia america
[41:20] they will never mingle together
[41:23] this is what we have actually witnessed
[41:28] in the day that we are living in that
[41:31] despite the fact that you can change
[41:35] whosoever leader and put another mask
[41:39] they still don't agree
[41:42] 2014 russia
[41:46] continued with their political agenda
[41:50] to claim all those states of soviet
[41:54] union
[41:55] by invading ukraine how many remember
[41:58] this
[41:59] just recently 2014 they invaded ukraine
[42:03] they took southern crimea and they made
[42:06] them
[42:07] russian citizens yes
[42:12] obama said russia
[42:17] is supposed to withdraw their troops if
[42:20] they don't
[42:21] we are going to sanction them
[42:25] the prime minister of russia had been
[42:27] changed
[42:28] it was no more policy on sin it was the
[42:31] vladimir putin
[42:32] we're still there today putin
[42:36] said sanctions or no sanctions
[42:40] russia is still going to move into
[42:42] ukraine
[42:44] and they were sanctioned they cannot
[42:47] agree
[42:50] we have beheaded a prophet who told us
[42:53] all these things
[42:58] no sorcerer no astrologer
[43:02] no magician could actually come up with
[43:06] this
[43:08] if he had to take a daniel of our day
[43:13] anointed from above
[43:16] who could study the mind of god
[43:19] and he come and tell the people
[43:23] russia america are not going to agree
[43:28] till that rock
[43:31] which was seen coming down from the
[43:35] mountain
[43:36] to crush the
[43:40] image right at the defeat
[43:43] any network was jesus christ amen
[43:46] so in other words what it means is
[43:49] this political disposition is going to
[43:53] continue
[43:54] till the lord jesus christ becomes space
[43:57] yes
[43:59] you know what i'm saying we are
[44:01] eyewitnesses
[44:04] one thing that is making slightness in
[44:06] the message
[44:09] people don't really believe that brother
[44:11] branham was a true prophet
[44:14] you know what i'm saying maybe because
[44:17] they never saw something practical
[44:19] that they can actually hold onto
[44:24] may i just say this
[44:28] with what i have seen with what i'm
[44:30] telling you today
[44:34] i actually faced it
[44:37] in lovely to see what is going to happen
[44:41] i can actually stand here to say i am an
[44:44] eyewitness
[44:46] of what i have seen amen of what was
[44:50] said by the prophet of god russia
[44:54] america are never going to agree
[44:57] in whatever way and is this not the
[45:00] thing
[45:01] that is going to make russia
[45:05] drop the atomic bomb into vatican city
[45:10] and destroy them within an hour's time
[45:14] the prophet says this is the lord amen
[45:18] mark of the beast preached in 1954
[45:24] yes
[45:29] i'm just about to close
[45:33] i don't take much time
[45:48] [Music]
[45:56] hallelujah still in the
[46:00] same spoken word becoming church age
[46:04] page 193 the prophet says
[46:15] thou art this head of gold
[46:18] and after thee shall arise another
[46:21] kingdom
[46:22] inferior to thee and another third
[46:26] kingdom
[46:26] of brass which shall be a rule
[46:30] over all the earth and the fourth
[46:33] kingdom
[46:34] shall be strong as iron for as
[46:37] much as iron breaker in pieces
[46:41] and subdue it all things
[46:45] [Music]
[46:48] and where's the also has the feet and
[46:50] toes
[46:51] part of porter's clay
[46:55] government as you see the lakes there
[46:58] too
[47:00] rome got divided into east rome
[47:03] and west rome they were both powerful
[47:08] but as we go down to the elastic
[47:11] government the fifth
[47:12] government they are losing power
[47:16] that's why they are now seen mingled
[47:19] with partly clay
[47:20] and partly iron because they are losing
[47:23] power
[47:25] you know what i'm saying amen but all
[47:27] this brother sister
[47:29] is coming to an end
[47:33] i can delightfully say we are right at
[47:36] the end
[47:36] amen that's why i entered my subject
[47:40] go and call daniel
[47:44] where the astrologers have failed the
[47:47] magicians had
[47:48] failed the socialism failed
[47:52] they are lying in the denominations
[47:56] promises that they tell people you know
[47:58] what i'm saying
[48:00] i see somebody
[48:03] suffering from stomachache
[48:05] [Music]
[48:08] you can stand up how many people come to
[48:11] church suffering from stomachaches
[48:15] how many people come to suffering from
[48:17] headaches
[48:19] in johannesburg there is a man who even
[48:21] affect the death
[48:24] they put him in a coffin you know what
[48:27] i'm saying
[48:30] i later only saw a headline written
[48:33] that man is now dead truly dead
[48:40] you don't play around with god
[48:43] with brother branham it wasn't real you
[48:46] know what i'm saying
[48:47] i remember brother perry green said
[48:50] one thing that he convinced him to
[48:54] follow this message
[48:57] brother branham had called you for a
[48:59] prayer line
[49:02] and there came a young girl
[49:06] no eyes only holes
[49:09] you know what i'm saying brother branham
[49:14] said
[49:16] no it did not have fit i think it was
[49:18] defeat here
[49:20] i'm sorry it was defeat
[49:23] did not have the feet so brother branham
[49:26] said
[49:27] can we close our eyes
[49:31] and brother berry green said i did not
[49:34] close my eyes
[49:36] i wanted to see how this one was going
[49:39] to be possible
[49:41] so what the prophet did is he did as if
[49:45] he did not care about the child
[49:48] he let off the child like
[49:51] dropping the child and the defeat was
[49:53] created
[49:57] hello we save
[50:02] a miracle-working god amen
[50:06] we are witnesses in this day
[50:10] yes can we just stand on our feet
[50:33] i don't know if you know the song let me
[50:35] walk with you
[50:36] jesus don't you ever leave me alone
[50:40] without you ever i can't do anything
[50:57] [Music]
[51:05] [Music]
[51:20] jesus
[51:23] [Music]

[53:02] [Music]
[53:11] i'd be glad for the word amen amen
[53:14] the beginning and the ending of the
[53:17] gentile
[53:18] dispensation praise the lord god has
[53:22] spoken to us
[53:23] showed us how the gentile nations arose
[53:27] from babylon is
[53:30] peace
[53:31] [Music]
[53:34] and coming down the means of persians
[53:36] [Music]
[53:37] iran today amen
[53:42] coming right down showing us in the time
[53:45] amen what a glorious thing that we can
[53:48] witness that today
[53:50] the iron and play
[53:53] and is it by coincidence those names
[53:56] were crucial and eisenhower
[53:59] how can it be coincidence
[54:03] amen
[54:05] [Music]
[54:07] so we thank god the the message that
[54:09] came down
[54:10] will make us draw our attention to the
[54:12] nations around the world
[54:15] what is taking place because it's gonna
[54:18] finish off with the nations
[54:20] god is waiting enough for all these
[54:21] things to set in life
[54:24] we believe it's called a bride the blood
[54:27] is already called out
[54:28] that's right so we're waiting for
[54:30] everything to put in place
[54:34] right we know there's going to be a
[54:39] uh covenant
[54:43] signed with israel and then right
[54:46] who's gonna sign the covenant rome so
[54:50] they're gonna make some deal right
[54:53] so many of you know the first of
[54:55] september monday
[54:57] was uh easterly being made again with
[55:00] israel
[55:03] for the first time at the israeli
[55:06] airplane
[55:07] flowing to dubai
[55:11] and dubai has now made a peace deal with
[55:14] israel
[55:15] that's right and peace deal with israel
[55:20] right so there's a big story behind it
[55:23] [Music]
[55:26] now i don't know how many of you follow
[55:28] the news
[55:29] and watching all these things that jared
[55:32] kushner
[55:32] is the son-in-law of donald trump
[55:36] and he's a jew young fellow
[55:40] he is his number one adviser
[55:43] [Music]
[55:44] donald trump's advisor he's a jew
[55:48] and he's going around making all his
[55:49] deals also there
[55:51] so when the plane landed in uh dubai
[55:54] he is there with the other delegates
[55:58] and uh one statement he made
[56:02] talking about all the the muscle
[56:05] you reckon we are all from one god
[56:10] he actually says that we are all from
[56:12] one god
[56:16] now they worship allah amen so that's
[56:19] not
[56:20] our god or that's not the jewish god
[56:22] that's right
[56:23] man so he said no we are all one god you
[56:26] know we
[56:27] were children of one god and he's gonna
[56:29] make a peace deal
[56:31] right so they're gonna sign this peace
[56:33] deal in america
[56:36] in a few days or weeks or so israel
[56:40] and dubai the
[56:43] arab united emirates
[56:46] yes right so we may assign it in america
[56:52] that is a peach deal amen
[56:56] right so now they're going to be free
[57:00] uh flights from or not free flights
[57:04] free movement of flight from dubai to
[57:07] israel
[57:07] israel to dubai they could have business
[57:10] deals and trades and everything else
[57:13] and they can fly from anywhere from
[57:15] israel
[57:16] or dubai to other parts of the world
[57:19] but the other main reason
[57:23] about the speech deal there's a more
[57:26] important reason
[57:28] now if you look at the map over there
[57:32] now for a while israel was planning to
[57:36] attack
[57:38] iran
[57:40] because of the nuclear weapons
[57:45] but now for them for their flights to go
[57:48] all the way from
[57:50] israel to go there
[57:54] and you know start that whichever way
[57:57] they're going to start the war and fly
[57:59] back
[57:59] they couldn't make it it's going to be
[58:02] too long
[58:04] for them to fly there and then they need
[58:06] to fly back
[58:08] for the plane was for long but now dubai
[58:12] is right across iran amen
[58:16] right across iran there's a shipping
[58:19] road there i don't know what they call
[58:20] the waterway
[58:22] the gulf of homas or something
[58:25] iran is right over there and dubai is on
[58:27] the other side
[58:29] so israel and america are going to have
[58:31] the bases over there
[58:35] and it will be very easy for them to
[58:37] attack iran and come back
[58:40] that's another main reason
[58:41] [Music]
[58:43] see now there's ah there's another
[58:46] nation there's oman
[58:48] next to dubai they around the corner is
[58:51] roman
[58:52] they're also going to make a deal with
[58:54] israel
[58:56] see another nation bahrain is also a
[58:59] saudi arabia for israel
[59:01] and then russia you know russia has been
[59:04] shielding
[59:05] syriana the prime minister or president
[59:10] of
[59:10] syria america should have killed him
[59:14] long ago
[59:16] but russia was there he called for
[59:18] russia to protect him
[59:21] and there's a certain portion of of
[59:23] syria
[59:24] they can't go there and fight but you
[59:28] learn a lot of fighting in damascus and
[59:32] the other part
[59:32] the western part but the other part they
[59:35] can't get to
[59:37] his name is basa right
[59:40] they can't get to him because the
[59:42] russians are protecting him
[59:45] so you see everything is playing out
[59:46] with politics
[59:49] the nations so i believe that's what we
[59:52] are waiting for
[59:54] but we know revelation 13 is a beast
[59:58] right that's rising up out of water out
[59:59] of the water
[1:00:01] from the people which is america amen
[1:00:03] that's right
[1:00:04] and the and this president now he's got
[1:00:07] a voice
[1:00:07] [Music]
[1:00:09] and he's got guts amen and he seems to
[1:00:12] be fearless
[1:00:14] there goes our election he seems to be
[1:00:17] fearless
[1:00:19] amen amen
[1:00:24] the little brother
