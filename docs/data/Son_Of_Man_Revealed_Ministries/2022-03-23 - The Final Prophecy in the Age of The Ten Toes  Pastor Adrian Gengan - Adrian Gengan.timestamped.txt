[0:00] [Music]
[0:22] and when the woman saw the tree was good
[0:24] for food and it was pleasant to the eyes
[0:27] and a tree to be desired to make one
[0:29] wise she took the fruit they often did
[0:31] eat and gave unto her husband with her
[0:34] and he did eat
[0:37] three seven and the eyes of them both
[0:39] were open and they knew that they were
[0:41] naked and they sowed fig leaves together
[0:44] and made themselves aprons so eating on
[0:47] this fruit made them recognize that they
[0:49] were naked
[0:50] it made them recognize their moral
[0:52] condition
[0:54] or should i say their immoral condition
[0:57] amen then we drop down to verse 12
[0:59] brother caleb and he says and the man
[1:01] said the woman whom that gave us
[1:04] to be with me she gave me off the tree
[1:07] and i did eat
[1:09] so we're seeing a whole lot of eating
[1:12] and the lord said unto the woman what is
[1:15] this that thou has done and the woman
[1:17] said the serpent beguiled me and i did
[1:20] eat
[1:22] so what is this heating about it's
[1:24] symbology
[1:26] let's go to proverbs 30 and 20 and see
[1:28] what the teaching is about
[1:31] it's not eating off an apple
[1:33] a pear apricot
[1:38] the church world is deceived
[1:40] that's another creed and dogma that was
[1:42] brought in
[1:43] you see a serpent wrapped around the
[1:45] tree with an apple in his mouth
[1:48] first place nobody would go near a
[1:50] serpent
[1:51] with an apple in its mouth
[1:54] proverbs 30 and 20 look at what eating
[1:57] represents such is the way of an adult
[2:00] who's woman
[2:01] she eaten
[2:02] why put her mouth and said i've done no
[2:04] wickedness
[2:15] and i have done no wickedness
[2:18] revelation 10 8
[2:21] after the prophetic anointing has come
[2:23] upon the earth
[2:24] after revelation 10 7
[2:27] when that voice begins to sound and the
[2:30] mystery of god is revealed
[2:34] then comes revelation 10 8 and a voice
[2:36] which i heard from heaven speak unto me
[2:38] again go take the little book which is
[2:41] open in the end of the angel which stand
[2:44] it upon the sea and upon the earth watch
[2:47] all this angel is positionally placed
[2:50] that's revelation 13 a beast rising up
[2:54] out of the sea a piece rising out of the
[2:56] earth
[2:58] so the angel is positionally placed
[3:00] suppressing these two powers
[3:03] amen
[3:04] i went to the angel and said unto him
[3:07] give me the little book
[3:09] watch one with authority
[3:14] one with boldness amen
[3:17] give me the little book and he said unto
[3:20] me take it and eat it up amen
[3:24] yes and he shall make that belly bitter
[3:27] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[3:29] honey
[3:30] you remember wednesday's message we
[3:32] broke all of this down amen
[3:34] hallelujah it shall be in thy belly
[3:37] butter but in that mouth sweet as honey
[3:40] amen let's go to the next verse and i
[3:42] took the little book out of the angel
[3:44] damn and ate it up
[3:46] and it was in my mouth sweetest honey
[3:49] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[3:52] was bitter
[3:53] and he said unto me that must prophesy
[3:56] again before many peoples nations
[3:59] tongues and kings
[4:00] [Music]
[4:05] we broke the down in the last message
[4:08] showing you how it was a fresh anointing
[4:12] the complete plan of revelation was now
[4:14] revealed to a bride
[4:16] the hidden mystery that was in the best
[4:18] part of god's mind had never hit the
[4:20] world before
[4:22] but now through the descending of the
[4:24] mighty angel the covenant angel when he
[4:26] descends with the book
[4:28] redemption's plan is revealed to an
[4:31] end-time people and even though jesus
[4:34] prophesied
[4:35] in amen in the book of matthew 28 i told
[4:37] them go into all the world preach the
[4:40] gospel
[4:41] yeah they were preaching a partial
[4:43] gospel that's right
[4:46] because the lamb had not yet taken the
[4:48] book in revelation 5. amen but after
[4:52] this lamb ascends to heaven and he
[4:54] begins to take the book and open the
[4:56] seals down comes this messenger the
[4:59] angel of the covenant with an open book
[5:01] back to the earth
[5:03] and his fresh word of prophecy must be
[5:06] prophesied to the people
[5:10] complete plan must be revealed to a
[5:13] people that's why the world is prophesy
[5:16] again amen implying the prophecy has
[5:19] gone forth but you need to do it again
[5:21] amen but watch where the prophecy is
[5:24] going now
[5:25] it's going to many people nations towns
[5:28] and kings
[5:30] means it's a job for you and i to find
[5:32] these people yes sir
[5:34] amen
[5:36] let's find them this morning amen amen
[5:38] let's go to revelation 13
[5:40] verse 7. let's see where the people of
[5:42] nation tanks and kings are so we know
[5:45] where the prophecy needs to go
[5:47] because remember part of the third paul
[5:49] is preaching to them
[5:51] lost yes
[5:53] and it was given unto him to make war
[5:55] with the saints and overcome them and
[5:58] power was given to him over all kindred
[6:01] towns and nations
[6:07] who is this we're talking about the
[6:09] beast
[6:11] all right
[6:13] power is given unto him over kindreds
[6:16] towns and nations
[6:18] let's follow these people revelation 17
[6:21] 1
[6:23] and they came
[6:25] one of the seven angels without the
[6:26] seven vials and talked to me saying unto
[6:28] me come up either and i will show thee
[6:31] the judgment of the great orb would
[6:34] sitteth upon many watches
[6:40] who's the great all
[6:44] mystery babylon
[6:46] mama is sitting on people
[6:49] mama is oppressing people
[6:52] mama is a gold digger
[6:54] digging out the money from the people
[6:58] a man the richest mama you know
[7:02] and she's sitting on many waters let's
[7:04] go to verse 15 with the caleb to get a
[7:06] definition of what these waters were
[7:09] and he said unto me the watchers which
[7:12] they saw where the horse sitted are
[7:15] multitudes and nations and towns
[7:23] now you know why your prophecy is to
[7:25] preach to the laws
[7:27] they are oppressed people
[7:36] would rather settle for a creed than a
[7:38] dogma than the pure unadulterated word
[7:41] of god
[7:44] true
[7:45] and let me tell you our daughters are no
[7:47] better
[7:48] man
[7:51] daughter lent
[7:53] prosperity gospel from mama that's right
[7:56] so seed sow a seed of a thousand dollars
[7:59] says benny him
[8:01] be connected to the anointing
[8:04] why would you want to be connected to a
[8:06] demonic anointing
[8:09] when the bible says come by of me
[8:13] [Music]
[8:17] amen
[8:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[8:21] amen amen
[8:22] now we find that this beast that we are
[8:24] talking about this beast that was
[8:26] wounded to death
[8:28] this roman system
[8:30] legs of iron
[8:32] ran all the way into the toes
[8:36] but mixed with clay clay typing of
[8:38] people but the spirit runs through the
[8:41] people
[8:44] now we are talking about the final
[8:46] prophecy in the age of the ten toes
[8:50] we find that it was wounded unto death
[8:53] but imperial pagan rome that fell
[8:57] amen became people wrong
[8:59] the strongest empire the roman empire
[9:03] which god had used at that time
[9:07] to bring a persecution
[9:09] on the people that had rejected christ
[9:12] had now been conquered
[9:16] but under constantine
[9:18] it came back to life
[9:20] when he saw his kingdom was being
[9:22] overtaken what did he do he put a cross
[9:25] on his shield
[9:27] church and state
[9:29] he put a cross on his shield
[9:32] and he went into battle
[9:34] he brought the christian faith into
[9:36] pagan rome
[9:39] they used to worship the sun god
[9:41] now they said we worship the son of god
[9:45] people roam and infiltrate to the whole
[9:47] world a power is absolute amen
[9:51] the prophet says she uses kings and
[9:53] merchants in a deadly religious and
[9:55] final financial strength she is
[9:58] governing as goddess of this present age
[10:01] she is also the dragon that stood
[10:03] waiting to devour the man-child
[10:06] we know that error tried to kill the
[10:07] lord jesus and failed later jesus was
[10:10] crucified by roman soldiers but he is
[10:13] now caught up to the throne
[10:15] that's revelation chapter 12
[10:18] now along with what we said and if we
[10:20] recall the vision of daniel which you
[10:22] just went through
[10:23] the last part of the image the last
[10:26] world power was in the feet that was
[10:28] iron and clay
[10:30] the iron is the roman empire
[10:33] but now it is no longer solid iron
[10:36] clay is mixed in
[10:38] yes it is there and running world
[10:40] affairs in both the democratic nations
[10:43] and the more despotic ones the lonely
[10:46] shirt is in every nation
[10:48] it is mixed up in it all yes
[10:51] i want to tell you that the roman church
[10:53] is in every denominational church this
[10:56] morning
[10:57] because they have come an economical
[10:59] move
[11:01] amen they have come under that one world
[11:03] religion
[11:05] so that worship this morning that image
[11:07] unto the beast has already been erected
[11:10] and this morning millions and millions
[11:12] are worshiping the image of the beast
[11:17] amen what did jesus say
[11:20] the father is seeking
[11:21] those that will worship
[11:23] in spirit
[11:25] and in truth
[11:26] there is no truth out there
[11:29] there is no spirit out there
[11:31] they've rejected the leadership of the
[11:33] holy spirit but you're in the message of
[11:36] the hour we rely upon the leading of the
[11:38] holy spirit amen
[11:44] amen you are in the message of the hour
[11:47] that is present-day truth amen
[11:50] walk in the light hallelujah he is the
[11:53] light amen amen
[11:57] oh hallelujah running world affairs
[12:00] running democratic nations the more
[12:02] despotic ones the prophet says look at
[12:05] the end of gold babylon amen look at how
[12:09] it amen was defeated look at all the
[12:12] needs and persians the greek empire the
[12:14] roman empire was defeated but look who's
[12:17] been ruling now for over 2 000 years
[12:21] amen
[12:22] amen that's right amen
[12:25] but thank god the prophecy amen
[12:29] if we are saying there's a prophecy in
[12:31] the last days
[12:33] in the days of the ten toes
[12:35] there is prophesied to come a song
[12:39] a stone that's rolling in babylon amen a
[12:43] strong prophesy that was cut out without
[12:45] him saying man our lord jesus christ is
[12:48] coming back to wash your feet amen
[12:53] how is he doing it
[12:55] through revelation
[12:57] upon this rock peter i will build my
[12:59] church
[13:01] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[13:03] against
[13:04] revelation revelation that is given to a
[13:07] people on the earth
[13:09] titled deep being given back to our
[13:11] people amen
[13:13] amen the god of heaven cut his stone out
[13:16] of the mountain without hands and smoke
[13:19] the image in its feet
[13:21] and broke all the gentile kingdoms down
[13:24] and the kingdom of christ will rule and
[13:27] reign
[13:28] amen
[13:31] this is what the prophet identified
[13:34] falling the two big toes
[13:36] in the ten toes
[13:38] eisenhower
[13:39] and khrushchev
[13:41] eisenhower was the us president
[13:44] crusher was the right soviet union
[13:46] leader
[13:47] the next picture
[13:49] all right so here he is and this is what
[13:52] the prophet picks up
[13:53] in 1960
[13:55] 12th of october
[13:57] crochet pounds his shoes
[14:00] now there were five eastern nations
[14:03] and there were five western nations
[14:07] and the prophetic eye of this eagle
[14:09] prophet
[14:12] looking through scripture
[14:14] picks it up and ties it with daniel's
[14:17] vision
[14:19] and said we are living in the age of the
[14:21] ten toes
[14:23] he said look at those two big toes
[14:26] this is here now at the un general
[14:28] assembly
[14:30] and iron and clay does not mix
[14:34] eisenhower was representing the western
[14:36] nations khrushchev was representing the
[14:39] eastern nations
[14:41] they became into a disagreement
[14:44] so much so he could not handle it
[14:47] and to express his outrage
[14:50] that this is not normal behavior
[14:54] for somebody to take off their shoe
[14:56] and start beating the guests
[14:58] does he look like a madman
[15:01] banging his shoe
[15:02] shoe banging at the ul throwing a
[15:04] tantrum
[15:06] telling you
[15:08] there will not be a mixing
[15:10] of these powers
[15:13] remember there are 10 kings prophesied
[15:17] 10 awns
[15:18] 10 crowns
[15:21] right the prophet says they are raised
[15:23] up for a specific purpose
[15:24] they're not mixing together
[15:27] iron
[15:28] and putin
[15:30] was put in
[15:31] you know putin means put in break the
[15:33] word up put
[15:36] an in
[15:38] he was put in
[15:39] biden sleepy joe if you don't know who's
[15:42] running things behind the scenes obama
[15:45] this was obama's deputy
[15:48] and they never got to fulfill all of
[15:49] their plans
[15:51] major thing happened recently because
[15:52] we're living in the days of sodom and
[15:54] gomorrah you remember obama made it
[15:56] legal for gay rights
[15:59] first time now
[16:00] last weekend
[16:02] this national
[16:03] thing in the u.s
[16:05] a man
[16:06] who identifies as a woman
[16:09] competed against women in a swimming
[16:11] race
[16:12] and he won the race
[16:14] he called himself transgender you know
[16:16] what they say they identify as a woman
[16:18] now you can
[16:19] in this day and age
[16:21] they tell you that your mother and
[16:22] father cannot tell you what gender you
[16:24] are
[16:26] when you come of age you can decide what
[16:27] gender you are
[16:30] they call it gender neutral
[16:32] now this is not small things
[16:34] because as it was in the days of sodom
[16:36] so shall it be
[16:40] now what is it done for women's rights
[16:43] poor women have been fighting for so
[16:45] long
[16:47] equal rights equal rights equal rights
[16:51] now all the rights were taken away
[16:54] because they fought for rights in our
[16:56] age of people's rights
[16:58] they fought for their rights so much
[17:00] that now men have the right to become a
[17:02] woman
[17:04] and compete in their own race
[17:07] and beat them
[17:09] now where they've been complaining that
[17:11] we were unfairly treated
[17:13] that men have been putting us down
[17:16] we want equal rights
[17:18] they've given too much rights
[17:21] that now men are competing with women
[17:24] you'll find it happening more and more
[17:26] you won the swimming race
[17:29] now there's a big outcry against that
[17:32] they should put tougher restrictions
[17:34] they shouldn't allow these men to take
[17:36] part with women
[17:39] all you got to do is tell them you
[17:40] identify as a woman
[17:43] and you can compete with a woman so we
[17:45] live in an age of people's rights
[17:47] now we showed you the picture the two
[17:49] big toes biting and putin it's come down
[17:52] but watch
[17:54] in the age of the two big toes
[17:57] let's continue reading what the prophet
[17:59] said here just to give you context it
[18:01] says let me give you something on the
[18:02] iron in clay
[18:04] remember when crusher beat yeshua on the
[18:06] desk at the u.n well there were five
[18:08] eastern nations and there were five
[18:10] western khrushchev spoke for the east
[18:12] and president eisenhower for the west
[18:15] in russian khashoggi's clay and
[18:17] eisenhower means iron the two main
[18:20] leaders of the world the two big toes of
[18:22] the feet of iron and clay were side by
[18:24] side he says we are in the end of it all
[18:28] then he says who is able to make war
[18:30] with the beasts
[18:32] now they are in some present times some
[18:34] great names in the world there's mighty
[18:36] nations but right now rome is calling
[18:39] the tune
[18:42] the pope is in the driver's seat and his
[18:44] power is going to increase no one can
[18:47] war against him
[18:49] all shall worship the beast except whose
[18:51] names are written in the lamb's book of
[18:53] life thank god for the sheep will not
[18:56] worship him
[18:58] everyone but the very elect will be
[19:00] deceived but they will not be deceived
[19:02] for they heard the shepherd's voice and
[19:04] they follow him amen
[19:07] amen
[19:08] now why i was tying that up hollywood
[19:11] puts it in there
[19:12] movies
[19:14] the politicians are now you can see
[19:15] they're putting it outside the u.n
[19:17] what they're doing
[19:18] then you remember the last time we
[19:20] showed you about the seagull and the
[19:22] crow
[19:23] outside the vatican
[19:25] we showed you one was a bird of the sea
[19:27] one was a bird of the land
[19:29] all typing revelation 13.
[19:32] then i found this cartoon because
[19:34] cartoonists can also put it out there
[19:37] we spoke about the true banging thing
[19:40] look at how this artist did it
[19:42] why is he typing putin to khrushchev
[19:46] he says back to the good old days
[19:49] why did the prophet identify this event
[19:51] as
[19:53] the ten toes
[19:55] watch this artist
[19:57] putin's got a shoe in his hand
[20:00] and he is saying it's the exact same
[20:02] thing
[20:03] as what khrushchev did church this is
[20:07] now how many years later
[20:09] 62 years later
[20:12] 62 years later
[20:14] how much more
[20:15] has that kingdom weaken now
[20:18] in the days of the prophet you know what
[20:19] he said he said look our poke now he's
[20:21] trying to bring about this one world
[20:23] religion we showed you in the last
[20:25] message how he's already signed it up
[20:29] 62 years later what was prophesied he's
[20:31] already come to pass
[20:35] 62 years later there's a people on the
[20:37] earth
[20:39] who are not deceived
[20:42] a stone
[20:43] coming forth
[20:45] to crush the ten toes
[20:48] amen
[20:50] watch now this is not an ordinary
[20:51] picture
[20:53] he is telling you
[20:55] look at the present time
[20:58] back to the good old days
[21:00] let me break it down to you spirits do
[21:03] not die don't look at the man
[21:05] amen
[21:07] same spirit that anointed crusher
[21:11] same spirit announcing future
[21:13] [Music]
[21:15] oh two hundred million demons let loose
[21:17] at the river euphrates said islam
[21:19] mussolini silent anointed these men to
[21:22] drive the jews back to their homeland
[21:25] and he says they've been coming now this
[21:26] is in the messy seventieth week of
[21:28] daniel he says they've been coming for
[21:30] the last 40 years
[21:33] 70th week of daniel was preaching 60s
[21:36] they've been coming for the last 70
[21:38] years back to the homeland
[21:40] and we preached the messenger last time
[21:42] showing you the reason for the russian
[21:44] invasion
[21:46] it's because they have the highest
[21:48] population of jews staying in ukraine
[21:51] and god is and you remember we showed
[21:53] you the picture and the article where
[21:56] they bombed their isolated jewish town
[22:00] it's time to drive the jews back to the
[22:02] homeland amen
[22:05] you say don't they have enough jews in
[22:07] the homeland
[22:08] no
[22:10] they all need to come under the ministry
[22:12] of moses and elijah
[22:14] they all must be given a fair chance we
[22:17] preached you they must recognize the day
[22:20] and their message
[22:25] so god is driving raising up putin as a
[22:28] tool like the pharaoh to drive the
[22:31] ukrainian jews back to their homeland
[22:37] but he's also giving the world us time
[22:40] we touched on the support earlier
[22:42] when there is pressure when these are at
[22:44] war there is scarcity of oil
[22:50] bringing into light matthew 25.
[22:54] where there is a shortage of oil
[22:58] what is oil signifying
[23:01] the holy ghost
[23:03] what does the holy ghost bring
[23:06] revelation
[23:11] it's time for a simulation of revelation
[23:15] it's time
[23:16] not to go you want to go back to those
[23:18] good old days i say it's time for the
[23:21] bride to go back to an acts 2 38 revival
[23:25] amen another moving of the spirit amen
[23:28] another sweeping time amen where those
[23:31] men were not afraid amen these men are
[23:34] not drunk as you suppose seeing that it
[23:36] is the third hour of the day but this is
[23:39] that what's the prophet william branham
[23:42] have prophesied that in the last days
[23:44] there will come another prophetic class
[23:46] of people in the land again who under
[23:48] their messenger will become the final
[23:51] voice to the final age in the age of the
[23:54] 10 goals
[23:57] amen
[24:00] amen amen
[24:02] hallelujah now watch
[24:05] when the nations are so weakened
[24:08] when it's iron
[24:09] which is
[24:11] a much weaker metal
[24:13] running through clay and he says they
[24:15] can't mix
[24:16] the prophet says what they were trying
[24:18] to do
[24:18] they
[24:19] married their catholic daughters to the
[24:21] protestant boys
[24:24] and you know they're they're very strict
[24:25] about how the child must be raised and
[24:27] he says they made it law that the
[24:30] children must be raised catholic
[24:33] so breaking
[24:34] that hold
[24:36] he says they can't mix
[24:38] now we want to end quickly with this to
[24:40] show that in the midst of iron and clay
[24:45] we're talking about that image now
[24:46] remember the image was a gentile kingdom
[24:49] head of gold
[24:50] right coming down to the toes iron and
[24:53] clay
[24:54] talking about a political system that
[24:56] will rule the earth
[24:58] in the midst of this god is raising up a
[25:01] people
[25:02] but they are not made of clay
[25:04] they are not made of iron
[25:06] he calls them pure gold amen
[25:10] taking us back
[25:11] to another head
[25:14] seven golden candlesticks he says and
[25:16] thou shalt be made a candle stick of
[25:18] pure gold
[25:21] be
[25:22] beaten work of the candle
[25:24] be made he shaft his branches his bowels
[25:28] cuffs his flowers shall be made the same
[25:31] the true church of jesus christ the
[25:33] bride is likened to pure gold
[25:37] now watch
[25:39] when i'm reading this i'm talking about
[25:41] you
[25:44] her righteousness
[25:45] is his righteousness
[25:47] unfiltering and failing
[25:50] it's not your works
[25:51] lest any man should boast
[25:55] her attributes are his own glorious
[25:58] attributes
[26:00] her identity is found in him amen
[26:04] what he is
[26:06] she is to reflect
[26:08] what he has she is to manifest amen
[26:12] there is no fault in her
[26:15] amen
[26:19] she is all glorious within
[26:22] and without
[26:23] from beginning to ending she is the work
[26:25] of her lord and all his words are
[26:28] perfect
[26:29] in fact in her he summed up and
[26:32] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[26:34] purpose of god
[26:36] how can one fathom it how can one
[26:38] understand it though we cannot do that
[26:41] we can accept it by faith
[26:43] for god had spoken it
[26:45] now he says the candlestick
[26:48] of gold is beaten gold
[26:51] handcrafted and beaten gold
[26:54] according to a blueprint which was
[26:56] spirit given
[26:57] outside of our lord and master jesus
[26:59] christ was ever people so beaten and
[27:02] purged as the bride of jesus christ
[27:05] surely she is filling up the suffering
[27:06] that christ has left behind
[27:08] her goods that are spoiled her life is
[27:11] in jeopardy she has accounted a sheep
[27:13] for the slaughter she is killed all the
[27:15] day long she suffers much and in it all
[27:18] she retaliates not neither does she
[27:20] cause others to suffer worthy of the
[27:22] gospel is this lovely bride of christ
[27:25] and as gold is malleable whereas brass
[27:28] will break with the beating this gold of
[27:31] god will bear a suffering for the lord
[27:34] not bowed not broken not destroyed
[27:37] performed as a thing of beauty and a joy
[27:40] forever
[27:41] by the trials and testings of this life
[27:44] amen amen
[27:50] he is bringing you forth this gold side
[27:52] in fire
[27:53] but remember the point of this message
[27:56] is
[27:56] in the midst of these ten toes when we
[27:58] see it coming to an end now
[28:01] the prophecy must go forth
[28:04] because you see where the peoples of the
[28:06] nations are
[28:07] you see the [ __ ] sitting on earth
[28:10] when you're sitting it's
[28:12] controlling her
[28:13] they are trapped in that denominational
[28:15] system
[28:16] they are trapped in that hindu system
[28:19] trapped in all religion
[28:22] but the prophecy must go forth
[28:24] because the last part of their third
[28:26] pull was to preach to the lost
[28:31] now i just showed you how the
[28:33] you are being tried you are being beaten
[28:36] you are being brought forth as gold
[28:38] amen
[28:40] you're born
[28:41] in fact you've been designed for this
[28:43] hour
[28:45] you don't see things the way the world
[28:46] see things
[28:48] people see things and they can't
[28:50] understand russia ukraine war you
[28:52] understand it
[28:54] because the prophet says
[28:55] you're from another world the spirit
[28:58] comes from above where holiness and
[29:00] righteousness dwell
[29:02] right we know the spirit comes from that
[29:04] seventh dimension
[29:05] he says born again christians is an odd
[29:07] ball to the world because you've been
[29:09] changed you're from another world your
[29:12] spirit is from across the chasm
[29:15] if you're not different there's
[29:16] something wrong you're still earthbound
[29:19] you ought to be heavenly minded and
[29:21] heaven lives by the word all our lives
[29:23] are to be so submitted where the holy
[29:26] spirit will live through us
[29:28] speak to us
[29:34] let's not forget the final prophecy in
[29:36] the age of the ten toes don't be slack
[29:38] concerning the things of god if god has
[29:40] called you to preach and preach if god
[29:42] has called you to witness and witness if
[29:45] god has called you to testify testify
[29:50] amen
[29:54] any day
[29:55] now
[29:56] my lord is coming
[30:00] he'll be returning
[30:04] for you
[30:14] [Music]

[30:32] for you and me
[30:36] oh i've been watching
[30:39] and i've been waiting
