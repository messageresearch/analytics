gather together with Believers of like Precious Faith amen so we're excited to see amen our visitors we welcome you and we pray that you are blessed we know that you are rejoicing amen neither day as we walk this Pilgrim Way amen so just remember the prayer requests that have gone forth amen the prayer request us to our sister so thee who fell in the bathtub and they're taking you at a hospital now amen we've already prayed over the situation and we're awaiting the positive report amen amen just to give you a feedback amen some testimonies so yeah we were on Sunday you know Sunday after the service and spirit of the Lord is moving in this place and we totally be sensitive to the angel of the Lord amen so we go outside dismiss the service and here comes with the same all excited amen you can see there's something countenance has changed and you can hardly speak he just wants to break down crying and then he shares the testimony he says brother I didn't know this now right he says brother I couldn't use my end I couldn't use my arm I couldn't even lift my arm but he says something happened there and if you those of you that were yeah you know I said that somebody wants to touch the touch the aim of His Garment and I didn't know the brother there was sitting with a need amen and he says he felt like something just a way to leave him and when I said let's just raise our hands and Worship the Lord he raised his hands and he got surprised that he could actually lift his hand up amen in the Peace of the Lord amen I tell you we are writing another book of Acts it's not going to happen it's happening now amen if we leave it up for another day in another age like I always say we might as well die and go to the grave and let the age that's going to come and do it be on the scene now amen but we are the church that God is working through we're always preaching that it's a mystery great mystery secret of how we were in the back part of God's mind but God wants to have the preeminence in his Believers now when are we going to allow the Holy Spirit to walk through us I tell you as the message church we really got to wake up we are the most powerful word but we have people sitting without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the new birth and that's the problem we have a second generation in the message now that have now become the life of the church but they've kind of inherited the message and haven't had not have not had the new birth have not had the new Holy Ghost experience I'm telling you we need to labor to make sure they have that experience otherwise amen what's going to happen we're gonna just end up believing the message and the prophet tells us believing alone is not good enough he says believing that's what the Baptists do they tell you that believing is a sign of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah in suspicion this evening I mean if you come pray it up amen hallelujah because you get what you expect if you come expecting nothing we're gonna go out receiving nothing but if we come expecting amen and and if you heard of that accident on the m41 the massive pile up last week on the 6th of March our sisters were caught up in their accident sister Elaine and sister Jaylene if you see the pictures of that car you wouldn't think anybody survived it the car was overturned it flipped several times the truck hit them and the cops flipped several times so something phenomenal happened because we've been preaching on the angel of the Lord amen my vision was that if we take the book of Acts and we marry it with our church because we're going to write another book of Acts you'll see the angel of the Lord present in the book of Acts visibly present he's opening prison gates for them he's leading Philip to the desert to the eunuch there there's a visible manifestation of the Angel of the Lord and exodus 23 23 says behold I send my angel before thee so if there was an angel in the first Exodus there's an angel in the second Exodus with the disciples they must be the angel of the Lord here and stop telling me it was in the days of brother Brandon because we are do not serve again the same yesterday today and forever amen Hallelujah so here we were and when I heard about the accident and I saw the pictures and brother Sunny called me to tell me his daughter was involved in this accident and then we were hearing the news reports that there was no nobody lost their lives and immediately I said the angel of the Lord was there to protect his sisters and because they were there he protected everybody else amen now the Bible says prove all things so we were looking for the manifestation and the presence of the Angel of the Lord so when I went to visit the sisters I'm just sharing this testimony because it might help you in your faith Amen to see that the angel of the Lord is present here with us you won't hear this testimony in the news report because they were eyewitnesses of what they saw there so just before the accident sister Elaine is now relating this story and she says sister Jalen that's a daughter now he's telling a mom can you see like this mist and this Cloud here night you may think that's ordinary incident why would somebody be showing their mother a cloud unless it's an unusual something amen amen so if you know that the the down to the m41 look overlooking the beat [Music] it's not in the arming down everybody know who I'm talking about the m41 it's not in the island that you would see clouds at that level because you're descending that way the clouds will be up there but sister Lane says I can't see anything I don't know what you're talking about hmm yes she's seeing something and she says I was getting frustrated with my mother because I'm telling her she was just about to open the window and say mom look there and sister Elaine is saying I can't see anything for me it's clear then it came to my mind where Elijah said Lord open the boy's eyes she said it was like a miss that was forming there and coming and I believe of the Lord because she said she was just about to open the window and say mom look there and then the accident impact happened so what was manifesting there I know some of you don't believe it because the 96 Chicago I've got a three clouds what is that we sit in the form of a cloud but the prophet says it's 7 the angel of the Lord is present with us and amongst us we need to be more sensitive to the angel of the Lord you know what if we lead him to recite he's a gentleman he won't come barging on us we got to be expecting to see him we got to be expecting to see the manifestation of the presence of the Lord and we thank the Lord for his grace upon the sisters lives amen hallelujah that they walked out of that accident with minor injuries amen hallelujah and he can do it for you yes I encourage you to call him on the scene amen amen I encourage you to depend on him amen now more than ever before check if we have the Holy Ghost amen I tell you because if that's the key the key to the message of the hour is the baptism of the Holy Ghost seek it with all you can amen if it means you fasting and praying and doing all you can don't go another day without the spirit of the Lord amen amen amen hallelujah I want to call Pastor Thomas amen living welcome Apostle key amen seeing that he knows him best I know he's looking at Pastor Denzel now but I'm calling Pastor Thomas amen so we welcome Pastor Denzel amen the other minister and brothers that are here amen welcome you good to see every one of you amen amen God bless you brothers and sisters amen amen is good to be in the house of God tonight amen hallelujah we've had a few Knights of Jubilee amen amen with our brother Pastor paulki from India some of you were there last night I see familiar faces amen and we had a wonderful time and I believe you're going to be blessed tonight amen amen um I think he's coming in um he is from guntur I think there was a mistake he's not from Hyderabad on the poster he's from guntur he's married and he's got two children he's got a daughter who is equivalent to the grade 11 in South Africa and he's got a small Sun as well I think about two years old [Music] um Pastor Paul came some of you might have heard him saying I am a Street Preacher and if you've been to India and you watched him he were the block off a street block it off completely and because of police and whoever it is it will put tents on the other either side and he would have a service people from the balconies would watch and be convicted by the sermons that he preaches you'll have all the ministers coming by um just a the work that is doing in India um you know in South Africa most of our churches people are backslid yeah after covert in India after covert people came in the message received the Lord Jesus Christ I'm talking about Pastor Paul King baptized 2 000 Souls amen over and above that he has planted 33 churches amen amen and 23 of them were denominational churches before that are now serving under the message the brother is so dedicated to the Lord that he prays up he leaves his family and you know uh you know the pastor's present I I just want to confess I feel ashamed when I look at the worker that the Pastors in India are doing especially Pastor Paul came I told him on many occasions I take my cap off for you he goes out into the streets he goes out into the deep forests and he goes out and preaches for days and comes back home he says every week there are baptisms that are taking place he's doing baptisms on a weekly basis I think in South Africa we're doing it on a yearly basis so I think there's a leaf that we need to take from amen amen you must understand that the ground is difficult the Hinduism ground is very difficult it's difficult to break but most probably we need to sit with pastor paulke and you know take a leaf out of his page so here we have a man who is actually in action amen Christ Jesus when he says he's a Street Preacher I think in the context of what I said tonight you will understand what he does it goes out for the gospel if he's called out you know he is one of the preachers that came by and he doesn't want a free day to go out to the aquarium or to the you know crop world and things like that he wants Ministry amen if he can get that soul irrespective whether it's India or South Africa if he can get that soul so my brothers and sisters we want to introduce pastor paulke and I think he's done a lot for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and he sits around with ministers especially the young ministers I'm talking about young in the message and he kind of kind of tutors them in the message of the Hour his Doctrine is straight you know he doesn't have any wishy-washy dachshunds around the message and so those of you who had him last night and the other nights as well on Sunday he preached two Services as well and if you heard him well you will find that he is a powerful preacher amen so I wish you can Just Surrender yourself and be subject to the spirit of God tonight as he comes to the pulpit I'm not sure whether we've been there and sing a song [Music] amen amen let's just stand together we sing a song and prepare our hearts for the word of the Lord amen [Music] thank you [Music] until this day no man could tell us just where we came from and where we go from here oh but Through The Eyes Of The Prophet God revealed to us before God was God all the way to do you believe it let's sing it now new things new things [Music] the angel of God is here leading our souls into the invisible [Music] for the impossible oh in this new day the angel of God not seen for two thousand years he appeared you're fixing things for us to leave believe believe that he's waving Visions oh what a vision he's giving us amen so we can walk step by step into what we before you things are being declared I know very soon I'll be raptured out of

Hallelujah you ready book of Acts amen chapter one blessed but it should raise your power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you amen and they shall be witnessed unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto thee at the most part of the year amen hallelujah amen so until unless you got Holy Ghost you are not a witness to God Amen Hallelujah John John gospel chapter 14. verse 26 but the comforter who is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you hallelujah praise the Lord see Holy Ghost I mean holy ghost or Holy Spirit he will not teach any new foreign yeah so if you are a real place in Christ in a position that means you are ready to receive the Holy Spirit once you receive the Holy Spirit nothing will stop you nothing fill you back nothing can deceive you Hallelujah says bride will not be deceived you know why the bride is the one who knows the word very well amen [Music] and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one occurred in one place amen yes that is the way to receive the Holy Spirit amen are you able to see in the house there the house there is a house it was The Upper Room the original that's where the Holy Ghost fell upon amen 120 people praise the Lord and suddenly there came a someone from Heaven as after rushing my to win and it filled all the house where they were sitting yes they never went to any place yes Holy Spirit came into their place amen yes and then appear unto them calling tongues as a fire and it sat upon each of them let me tell you it never went out amen amen that's where the first church age was taught here from then it was started after the filling of the Holy Spirit the first church was started amen praise the Lord amen well if Lord willing then I would like to bring a subject amen may God add his Blessing to the reading test amen praise the Lord great introduction thank you and thank you very much it's so kind to me he's always struggling with me you'd like to [Music] meetings and talk to people I I never know some of these people but you know brain and the plan amen if any past is asking me the days I'm saying only one thing they prayed and planned so I should not put my finger in the program that's what prophet always says if God is doing anything in my life I don't like to put in my finger yeah because he's working then I should be calm then only you will walk praise the Lord see what is the upper room experience please excuse me amen told you I will sit with you amen I'd like to list the weight yeah that's how but it will do all the time that's why you are removing all the arguments from the body and we are not taking out something from our heart yes that is very dangerous for the rapture we have to take it all out amen see that's what the upper room experience yeah yeah see a problem experience is not an incident yes amen so Prophet said one time all the Revival will last three years but Samuel some River lost 15 years yeah everybody says that was the greatest Revival but let me tell you the Pentecost Revival it was never ended amen I believe that it is here tonight Hallelujah do you believe it is here tonight do you believe that it is in that one see the thing is uh Holy Spirit doesn't see the place and the people yes yes is that right amen if he's working in India he will work in that but amen because everybody says that that's what is secondary yeah it's a voice here too amen amen I believe it power of the Holy Spirit the power God started showing the power of the Holy Spirit from the day of Pentecost amen see you want to show the power of the Holy Spirit yes he showed his power in the Old Testament but he wanted to show the power of the holy spirit amen through a person see God can do all things but God would like to do things from the body of human being amen so the reason he sent the holy spirit so there is a purpose to send the holy spirit in amen see Hallelujah you will not walk but holy spirit holy spirit will work through your body does what God wanted to do amen so God needs a body he never expected any sacrifice he says that I need a body I want a body see praise the Lord I love it amen let me read the quote what we need is an old Upper Room experience amen is it right yeah see where God powers out his holy ghost power and fire like he did in the beginning amen that's what you would like to do tonight if you are ready to take the Holy Spirit you want it Hallelujah you want it you want it God love to give it if you really want it he's there to give it because you promised you one thing where there is gather two or three in my name amen you know why he said that hmm in the beginning In The Garden of Freedom there were only two people God would like to finish with them yeah he's God of Jehovah the same God was in Jesus he said where there is two or three I will be there amen he's working sin is yesterday today amen is a god of Eden Garden is God of government today amen praise the Lord I'm just I'm just moving now until I get my point see the message God who is this in this last days both reign of the Apostles and the reign of the Lord Jesus that's what's making the people cry out Hosanna to him that committed in the name of the Lord amen amen see there are two kinds of rains you all know that yeah there are two days first one is when the formerly stars then you know all the farmers will start their working so when will the lettering will come after the Harvest or before the Harvest it will come before the Harvest amen amen amen so now we are in the time of harvest yes so let me ask one question came or will come amen hallelujah yes amen if it can then let me know where it is now somebody would like to say that it was in The Bride who is the bride amen amen if you think that you are dry then later was in you it is in you tonight amen but you have to believe it amen you must believe it amen if it was then it will be in you now see in this last days both reign of the Apostles amen and the reign of the Lord Jesus see Prophet said what is letter y form or rain plus letter line is equal to letter Y amen amen hallelujah plus works of Jesus Christ is Holy Spirit today amen please don't say that it was in the Bible yes what it is today are you believing that you are right amen then why are you hesitating to say that you are a brain I don't feel shy I don't feel shame to say that I am the bride amen amen no matter what happens if God called you hey man amen it's hard to say that amen you have to believe it you have to have faith on it absolutely amen no matter what happens they may laugh at you no mind no mind never mind hmm you are the bride no matter what amen amen Hallelujah see after come the reign of the Apostles that was the first showing that was the former Ray then you see look at the Pentecost experience when they went up in the upper room they were afraid see yes they became Brave all right when they are entering into the room of the upper I mean in the upper room they are afraid amen they are fearing the feeling of the people once she was filled by the spirit of God nothing will afraid you amen the people who are your friending they became now amen praise the Lord they went out into the street that's where the street preaching started amen amen amen yes it's all right amen amen amen praise God they did not care what the people said God is in his people hallelujah I believe he's safe today amen you save me that bad the seven Phoenix two I believe it see they didn't care what the people said yeah there is a first portion of the Bride we are the last verse of the Bible yes why will be bright all the time amen because the holy spirit is safe so so is bride is it right amen amen when they went up in the room upper room they were afraid but they became blue what what was happened there what is the difference they were only 10 days in the room praise God let me continue are you still doubting it [Music] say judging of the word is nothing but doubting Jesus Christ so that's the reason Prophet always says bride will not doubt the vote Yes amen bride was filled by spirit of God so the reason she won't doubt the vote don't doubt the word each and everything of God Amen and how can you tell yourself yourself is it right you don't doubt it mustn't doubt amen Amen Let me let me maybe I I'll tell you one thing before saying this I'm not a police preacher I'm not a very polish preacher as I told you I'm a state which I would like to talk to the heart amen amen amen are you growing in the church or in the world praise the Lord amen Speak Lord yes are you growing in the church or in the world baby yes when we are grown up in the chest then you will look like that you said I have so many years experiencing the message I'm sorry your help then why you're acting like a baby yes see I'll tell you when the Red Sea came before Moses then Moses started crying yeah opening up the Reds is a thoughtful act yeah Indonesia of Moses yeah God gave all things to Moses he's able to speak he can't fries he called France because they call it many things but see when the big thing came before him he started crying like a baby yeah yeah see Prophet is sorry you ought to be a man hallelujah amen see that's why Prophet always says Jesus Christ cannot marry a baby amen everybody is today they are saying that we are the third point we are the third pole we are third yes we are thoughtful the same time you are mature now amen not by yourself not by your experience in the message not because you believe necessary so many years back no sir because you are filled by the spirit of God because you know the place where you are today amen amen so are you growing up in a church or in the world I'm not feeling ashamed to say these things yes amen don't digest to them still some Churches they don't like to preach on Seven Seals yeah and pulls and 70 weeks of Daniels you know why it says that our beliefs cannot able to digest it then how can you say that we are the end time amen yes yes let me tell you let me tell you a secret we are not in the end time we are at the end of the time well at the end of the time then when you when will you you preach this is not a trading time brother this is a fighting time that's right amen you have to fight in all this election amen is that right amen praise the Lord without knowing the word they cannot receive the holy spirit amen see God Gave You knowledge God Gave You wisdom to understand the world but sometimes you need to forget your knowledge to understand the word yeah is it right amen that that's what happened with soul he went to he went for pastor trading for three and a half years when when he came back see all things were changed you have to forget all of his training knowledge then he became Paul is that right amen praise the Lord see sometimes a message will not able to understand you know like because you have to tell it the silk shot yeah you know you ever still shut you remember about any anybody remember about the silk shot yes Alicia is going to break the parts of I mean uh he's able to hit the Jordan see when you try to hit it then Prophet said it never happened you know why he has a silk shirt on his body before we come to the original World you have to tell all this amen yes until the old knowledge before receiving the Holy Spirit you have to attend all knowledge yeah amen you need it press the one please excuse me if I say anything hard to you but I won't stop amen see time tested faith in a message Prophet says no man has the right to take the pulpit to preach the gospel unless he's had a backside of the desert experience it may hurt you but it is true absolutely amen we need we need gospels amen not gospel before going to preach gospel you need gospel amen praise the Lord no man has the right to take the pulpit to praise the gospel you know why Prophet always says that God told these 120 people you must not come down until you receive the Holy Spirit and they said you must not come down any mustard preach any sermon until you receive the holy ghost first amen hallelujah amen then only people will able to receive the Holy Spirit teaching was supreme god then people will receive it that's what happened with Peter that's what happened with spout that's what happened the same thing will happen tonight too absolutely amen you must feel once amen then they will yes let me continue some some Believers would like to be very happy when they are leading that court but this might be no man no person has the right to call themselves a Christian it's not a good picture it's a word believers no person has the right to call themselves as a Christian until they have had a backside of the desert experience amen amen he started preacher it's for a Christian amen then think about the message will you want yes yes amen it is still the backside of the desert we call it Upper Room all right you understand me are you with me tonight amen I know that tonight I don't get too many almonds but it is still the backside of the desert too it is where you meet God Amen what is Upper Room experience talking to God personally it's a personal experience always says that Born Again experience see Moses has the experience Paul has the experience his scale has the experience they all meet God directly amen thank you see no person has the right to call themselves a Christian until they have had a backside of the desert experience see how many hours we are playing it at home amen hallelujah amen amen but let me tell you I I don't believe praying too many hours I'm not giving any statement yes see I'll tell you a small story in a minute when boy is there is a is studying a metric is leading all the day but he failed in the examination what is wrong with him whenever you see him he's just opening and watching the book and reading and is by Harding and why did he fail is the reading is spending time but nothing is in his mind then some people would like to pray all the day [Music] they may not be the Rapture yeah you know why if God Gave You exam if you got 99 marks that means you're afraid is it right amen we have Grace but in God's exams you don't have any grades we have only one great you have to get sent percent but because some people only will give you a mark That's why we say it's all in examination we call it a mark you know Grace mark Factor God gave a Christmas to Jacob God gave a Christmas to David God gave a Grace not to Paul and the same God gave me he given me Christmas so the reason I'm here tonight praise the Lord see those who are in the word of God will believe the full word amen they believe that the world was open tonight it was open see what is purple that's what prophet said but what is the acts of the third Polo yes amen what about the acts yes you need the power of the Holy Spirit [Music] amen open word you need the power of the old yes see see Prophet said that God never gave the word of God only but he gave the power of God too what is Third World opening of the word and power of the god that God is amen that's why you call anything in the thoughtful you call anything it will happen it will come to the existence no matter what happens but you have to believe it amen until unless you believe it won't happen amen because you are saying you are part of Christ when you are saying Christ will do that praise the Lord amen let me continue we know all these three pictures amen right when John was asking to eat the book then he never doubted did he not yet did he asked God God how can I eat a book he never doubted he just followed the world that's how the bride will follow the world Amen it won't ask any questions amen praise the Lord when Moses was asked to separate the Red Sea then he never doubted it see when God came to Moses then he said just Moses open I mean raise your hand and show the rod to the Sea did he asked God that God will it open in the third pole we don't doubt the world you just believe it let me tell you a secret is the thoughtful God will talk to you directly in the third pole yes and the greatest thing is YouTube will talk to him directly amen nobody between you and God nobody between Moses and God nobody Between Brothers and God nobody between pride and Christ tonight amen Hallelujah we'll talk to him directly you can see him the denomination says that God is here tonight but who he says that God is in me tonight amen it's so personal the message is so personal amen it is separating from us to me is that right see the pillar of fire was owed them and was in them that believed in full world those who believe the full word it came to them yes is that right amen yes yes he was not there when God said holy spirit amen he didn't believe it he came for business in the message I'm sorry yes it came from business in the message yes sir God didn't allowed him to be filled by his Spirit to feel his spirit is that right God knows every heart of him because God Will Take Your Heart see that's what prophet always says God was able in the beginning it was in the midst of the people but now where is tonight amen God is saying that he want to come in your heart amen amen not only in your heart you would like to come in the center of your heart God want to put his throne in the center of your body from there he will lead you from there he will guard you from there he will he will talk to you amen from there he will do his acts yes praise His Lord blood on the coming of the Holy Ghost in his last days has sent for the Revival amen how do you recognize the Holy Ghost amen by Revival see Prophet always said they will produce two things yeah yes amen one will last immediately one will continue amen until the day was designed praise the Lord amen what is Revival what is Revival it will consume the only things and human things that was in your heart yes it was sent there for a purpose you know what is the purpose to clean your heart Amen to clean your heart definitely will come to repentance yes you can't you can't come to repentance without Holy Spirit yes is that right when the Holy Spirit touches you then you will come to repentance then you will come to come on your night your knees yes is that right amen until unless you don't come true see what is a river tonight Robert says in a message the great coming revival and outpouring of the Holy Spirit it is it is evening time our Gentile Revival is ending pretty soon let me ask you a question is ending pretty soon um the Revival is going to end that means where is the river will tonight we are looking for a Revival yes but Prophet is saying that it is in you tonight amen Hallelujah you know you know the river is here the Jews are going to take the river they are waiting for the Revival if you are waiting for the rivers that means you are a Jew yeah we must know what is you are living we are on the age of Revival where is yes we are the ease of opening of it amen as soon as they can see the power of God manifesting and receive the Holy Ghost as they can see the power of God manifesting what is Revival the power of God manifests and receive the Holy Ghost they will take the gospel they are waiting for the gospel they are waiting for the Holy Ghost they are waiting for the Revival yes that means all things are in the bright now amen our gentle days are ending get into the kingdom while we have a chance to get into the kingdom we're at the end of the end time we are at the end of The Gentle enter praise the Lord amen so where is the Revival tonight is it the bride where is the bride where is the bride tonight tonight [Music] where is the word of God tonight amen it is in you or in the bride please don't say that it is in the bride yeah if you believe or a boy then you can say that it is in me amen amen it is personal the message is so personal because Rapture is individual amen see belief is in wonders a people that is called out separated people a people that's free in there that shouts and screams the Praises of God Amen Hallelujah they believe in science and wonders amen that believes in science and wonders why the same thing as it was then is now amen amen as it was done in the former ring now in the later line now in the days of third world Amen it was same amen they followed the signs right they followed these thoughts and everything yes but now we are falling throughout amen praise the Lord let me tell you what was the first sign I or former rain see was his own real Prophet says his own reign they called him when he came in the power former Reign they said he was Belgium a devil when you are doing things when God is doing things through you then people will not able to understand it there is a lot of things they may consume amen they may throw you away they may say a lot of things but you have to remember only one thing that you are not doing those things God is doing amen praise the Lord hallelujah all the glory to God Amen let me continue and the bride will get ready the world asks who is it but the Saints kinda to ruin that cometh in the name of the Lord they are separated people yeah see when Jesus is coming at the Donkey they never would like to see or hear any of the world they're just watching Jesus they're just following Jesus they don't like to hear anything you know people say a lot of things but they don't like to hear anything the world asks who is it it is the Holy Ghost amen who is it the spirit of God what is Holy Ghost the spirit of God bowed out upon the church let me ask one question where is the holy spirit tonight amen amen it was poured in the upper room where is it tonight it is in you amen because the same it was the first person of the seven churches you are in the last portion of the seven churches The Same Spirit was in the first churches and Same Spirit was in the Lost churches praise the Lord in the last days to show signs and wonders see powered out upon the church in the last days to show signs and wonders we thought Holy Spirit you can't see there is sign in any Wonder yeah that's right holy spirit will help you because the reason why Holy Spirit was sent to guide you Amen to teach you to understand the word amen see sometimes you are not able to understand the word then brother said fell in love with the word yes yes then you will understand the Bible amen you have to fall in love with God amen then you will understand Holy Spirit can do that no man can do it it's like I'm just going fast power of the Holy Spirit you must know the power of the Holy Spirit Moses had the upper room experience is that right amen and I'm asking you do you have the apparent experience yes are you sure amen amen are you afraid anytime after receiving the Holy Spirit no can you say I'm my father amen are you already afraid after I'm seeing the Holy Spirit faith has no fear amen absolutely Faith doesn't have fear amen if God call you then nobody is not able to stop amen you know the thought of the Holy Spirit Jesus said in Matthew 16 he said no power has power to stop you yeah yeah because you are built by Jesus Christ you are the Church of God you are on the revelation of Christ so nothing will come to you nothing will pull you nothing is not able to deceive you because you're part of the world amen amen even the gifts of Hell will not Prevail against him no by Apple is not able to prevent against you because God is in you amen where is God tonight I'll show you some people that Peter has Paul has Daniel has his skill has all has a problem experience yeah they went and they talked to God directly in the bride everyone in the bride will be do the same thing yes they will talk to God directly what is more again experience talking to God directly and having fellowship with God directly amen everyone Master amen see in India I'm hearing so many questions that some some Believers would like to say that our past how no Holy Spirit then what about you if you have the Holy Spirit you pray for the faster than possible recipe amen all right don't say anything again it will pass I don't like don't murmur any against your person because God appointed your pastor amen for his job you must not say anything against him see why why David didn't kill Saul because God said I want things and great people must not touch my anointing amen amen so you must follow that word you must not say anything again is your pastor see some some would like to call me and says that a lot of things against their Pastor I'll say that if you are in the church if you want to be in the church don't say anything against your past they'll come out and they'll call me Pastor now I came out from the church I want to say about the pastor and I said what is the need now right so no need to try again if you are really have experience with God personal experience with God you don't curse anyone amen no need to cast God will do that yes if he did anything wrong then God will take action that's why see Bride has the double portion believe it yeah the preacher has a double punishment why why are we entering into double punishment it's very hard to preach from the pulpitra amen somebody would like that see Prophet said all the men in the church would like to preach after preaching a settlement every believer every man in the church would like to say if I am there maybe I'll preach more than you better than him then why you had a pastor it is a call say Prophet Prophet said in a message called an angel at the end time those who are preaching at the end time they were four are dying amen you were not ordered by some pasta or some brother or some a person evangelist you are foreign he said I saw God calling him he never added Timothy he said Prophet says that I saw God calling Timothy because his forefather is a pastor see that was in in Timothy so he found the call and he said you have a call yes it's a declaration it's not ordination yes so it's a declaration of the ordination praise the Lord amen see do you have all the expert how the experience of the upper room you must have before the Rapture amen let me ask you where do we get the abortive experience do you get anywhere knows that we can't get anywhere but in the world amen it can't go anywhere so in a message expectation 55 he said Prophet says that we need back to the Bible to the old-fashioned Holy Spirit good old time Saint Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost is what we need back in the church again tonight amen what we need it praise the Lord amen amen see saying but friend friend the wheat is still moving on we are one of the greatest revivers it lasts longer history shows that the Revival only lasts about three years this one has been 15 years or more great healing campaigns but it's cool of now it's cool off now you know why it was cooled up we are sharing the testimonies I love to share the testimony I always say the show we must not hide the testimony amen but see one one the healing was happening the family who was benefited by the healing they don't like to come to the church next week because they're busy sharing testimony that's how they are going far from the church so once God healed you then you are a testimony in the god so how to how to show gratitude to God how do thanks you God see what happens in our churches especially the message churches if anything happens in the family or healing or something happen they may get the job or something they'll call the pastor to call it all the church and they say the Thanksgiving service they'll give some offering to parcel I'll name a president to Pastor they'll provide food everything then it is over yeah yeah it's not about one day thing from then you have to give your life to God amen amen from then if anything happens personally in your life that means god is looking to you amen what is healing you know what is healing only God can give it amen nobody can give it so that when God saw you God showed Grace towards you amen God healed you that means god actually you know especially in the church because you find favor in the sight of God Amen amen amen that means god is attracting you God is calling you through the healing amen amen amen why Jesus did all the healings in his first food to attack the people yes to gather the people that's right to attack the people to the world so now why God is giving healings in the church why God is giving testimony to the [Music] church's fish once he was caught you must give your heart to God Amen not like Samson not like Samsung is half heart to God well he's able to fight then he feels like a warrior are they freeze the war then you look for a woman because he give halfway to women how far to God but God wants full surrender the same God wants to wear full armor of God not half I'm sorry really I'm sorry to say this today is some preachers they only read four books of prophet they don't read whole Bible they leave only four books they say that they have God God hmm how can it be possible yes how could it be possible if God called you then God will give you full word because we are not in the beginning days of the thoughtful yes without the ending days of the thoughtful this more powerful to preach at the end time amen I'll tell you one thing maybe maybe you'll agree or not I don't know but I would like to bring it your notice when Prophet is preaching about the seven sins then there was no Revelation at the time then he started preaching but now you see the revelation it's more Revelation than when it's more Revelation today in the mobiles we have table lamps YouTube preachers a lot of YouTube channels are there everything is available today while you are driving the car we are healing messages we're at home we are living the message when we have time we are reading messages see the Revelation is more and more and more powerful today than the days of Brothers amen see there's a dangerness also there yeah if the Revelation is getting more and more when you are receiving more Revelation sometimes you know you will help yes only revelation will not help you brother amen absolutely only revelation will not help you you need holy spirit amen hallelujah let me tell you who got the keys of Kingdom of Heaven yeah Peter then why you dinner Jesus Christ amen Jesus is is nothing but the word yes then who did it Peter the word of God how can he has the Revelation see God himself said Peter you have the Revelation I give the keys how can he denied God that because he had to receive holy spirit amen Holy Spirit never denied he never ever denied to receive it is there for you you have to ask God Amen see so many times you would like to come to pass our lord for so many things person for job person for house person for uh get our daughter should getting married so please pray for me you lost a lot of things right but if ever you ask God your pastor to raise your Holy Spirit first will you pray for me to receive Holy Spirit have you ever asked what does what we need today amen see Prophet always says we thought holy spirit will not enter into the empire we thought holy spirit will not be in the Rapture amen Hallelujah we are not in the beginning days of the seventh Church ages we have the ending we came at the ending Prophet says that we came to our uh our starting point now he said maybe today or tomorrow we are going back to our own place will take place between morning six and nine yeah sure so what happens if it happens tomorrow morning how many are ready to receive the holy I mean to to be in the Rapture how many are so that's why he says that you need Holy Spirit each and every hour amen each and every hour see when Peter received Holy Spirit he never denied Jesus Christ he never afraid of anything he became Brave they caught it they said will kill you he said how would like to kill me on the cross he said okay no problem but can you do me a favor can you do it upside down yeah there's the one who ran away see the power of the holy spirit amen let me tell you one thing when when Peter was in the prison he never left afraid of the prison you have any of you have experience in the prison I have I was seven days in the prison without doing anything because of my close friends I was there in the prison I was I was not a preacher at the time I just read a book Paul a prisoner to Christ last night and the next day morning five o'clock somebody knocked my door and I opened their police they took me to the jail what can I do it was a Friday evening so I don't get bail on Saturday and Sunday so my family came and upgrade on Monday they don't know how to apply because we never face this kind of things they failed to produce all the documents so I didn't get it so you know what happened to the channel and the Sunday Saturday morning I was I I tried to get a Bible I would like to read Bible on my knees at the time so I was reading my Bible on the fourth trial on my knees at the time so I got the Bible the Bible has no Genesis and no revelation because it was only Bible in the prison so I asked her depleted them to give so they give me and I started reading at the window from morning eight o'clock to three o'clock I started reading so jailor was walking and observing me the day was went on very well the next day morning we all were called to the assembly and suppose their pastors come and preach for 15 to 30 minutes we were standing in the lane there were 200 prisoners there with me so the passage didn't came the Jailer came to me directly and they asked me hey come and preach he said I said I'm not a pastor and they said they are not Believers with God grace what is good then I came to know why God put me in the prison first day the first day I mean Friday night I never sleep I was crying just like I don't know why I came here I started believing Jesus Christ and I started reading messages there I don't know what was happening I'm just thinking that maybe something I did wrong so the reason I came here but I don't know why God sent me there praise God so then I went there and I took the same Bible and I preached it for 30 minutes and after preaching after finishing up preaching there were a lot of tears in me and I was walking somebody came to me he said what was your name I was not able to tell my name then he said maybe whatever your name is from today we'll call you Paul amen because I appreciate Paul's The Prisoner yeah so all the my colleague president started calling me Paul they named me Paul from second day to seventh day I never feared one one thing ever one thing because I know that why I was there amen God has a plan praise the Lord I'll tell you one thing if you do good things then sometimes you will be in the prison are you sure see Joseph passed the examination that was connected by God for the Vera wife right did Joseph was the examination or not yeah it was a distinction he got sent percent marks then God gave him a promotion he's supposed to give a promotion God sent him in the prison you know why they are true persons in the prison very close to the king amen Joseph's supposed to be next king yes so they are there to to they're there to explain how to be a king that's the reason God sent him in praise the Lord say God will act like that so when when I was when I'm going into the prison then I'm a Believer when I'm coming out I'm a pastor see God made me pass in the prison see the same way when Peter was in the in the prison he never afraid of you know you can't get sleep you don't get sleep with the prison there's one I'm trying to tell you now you don't get sleep with the prison right because tomorrow next day morning is going to be sentenced and before the day they killed his brother Jacob you know that they are going to kill the next day but Peter is sleeping in the in in the prison see property is snoring [Music] even Prophet said holy spirit went into the prison and he called Peter and Peter he never wake up then you know sometimes we'll do in our family we'll go and pass the person Peter Peter he said yeah you never know how he came out the same there is church is praying for you let me tell you before closing this if the church has the Holy Spirit then how they will respond amen when Peter was in the jail in the prison no one stood up in the church they said he Peter told me once he was with me he said you would be you will be the next Pastor nobody came and said laughs you know why brittle has the Holy Spirit yes the same holy spirit is working in the church amen see what they did they locked the door even children are inside they are praying the 12 years girl is there inside they never went out they're all in the church they are praying for Peter amen they were filled by the spirit of God they were led to pray they never went outside yes so God listened their prayers and answer amen see Bible says that the Holy Spirit bring him and live at the door yes praise the Lord the holy spirit will guide you to proper way to proper place to proper channel the perfect way perfect place that's how Peter were led by the spirit of God see what happens sometimes they are praying inside God brought out Peter outside and he was there Peter is not if sorry Peter is knocking the door but nobody is not listening to Peter when Jesus was rose from the dead there was a Mary she's watching Jesus and she's crying she's asking Jesus where is my Jesus all the Church of creators break the Peter where Peter came in his knocking the door yeah yeah sometimes he will be you will hear like a baby some you know in our church in our families some of our children they would like to cry for chocolates in the beginning we'd like to say that no but we have some we say no when they are started crying we'd like to offer the chocolate they said no they'll cry yeah that's how Mary is doing there that's how Chacha Peters did that's how bride is doing today God gave you everything yes amen you must not cry yes you have to ask God Amen that's what John 14 14 said he had to ask you know what John 14 20 said that day he will know I am in you you in me amen this is the day that is the day this is the day the thoughtful day this is the day end of the day we know that we are in the position now you must have that Upper Room experience then only you'll receive the Holy Spirit once you receive the Holy Spirit then you know your position in the world you position the Christ your place in the bride then you won't cry for anything you ask or to speak things amen you know your position today you need the experience of the upper room before going into the action amen Rapture is waiting for you you know what is waiting for you all the signs of six such changes are waiting for you amen do you believe it amen all the angels of the heaven are waiting for you praise the Lord Jesus himself is waiting for you yes amen all the apostles are waiting for you amen all the seven churches are waiting for you the souls under the altar are waiting for your entry into the heavier they are waiting all the people in the four seats they are waiting for the rapture they are waiting for you see Prophet always says that if anybody is taking baptism on the Earth all the ages in the heaven they will stand up on their toes and the seat down that this is the last one maybe read back in India will see them every week you know why you would like to give baptisms every week yeah yeah not on weekly basis we would like to give every amen I like to sometimes you know one time I went I went to give some baptisms in a village called so he gave 11 baptisms there is four hands but while we started going they came 11. it was a mud like you know like there are some some Thrones there so we went there uh we gave our princesses back there was a month until my niece I was sitting there they were just about to drink my coffee I was not washed my legs one sister came she's walking very slow she said for 70 years maybe her name is Padma she just came and said as I'm waiting there to get the population she didn't come to the service but she packed our calls and waiting for that place he said sister oh can we probably will go there and I gave the coffee and I went there to do the baptism so baptism is important than the coffee right praise the Lord because we know when when God is moving then you don't need to act anything yes you don't need that in it you just keep following it if the holy spirit is working in you you just follow it amen you need to identify the holy spirit amen you need to identify your position in Christ once you know your position yes then you don't run for any other thing things will come to you things will follow to you that's what prophet said that's what Bible said you don't need to run after signs and wonders science and wonders Will Follow You amen scientists Advantage will follow the bride amen amen the cloud came 1963 to the right and third grade praise the Lord bribe didn't went to anywhere to find the cloud it came to mind I never went to any church to get rather welcome books for the first time it came to me you don't need to go and run it to any other place like I want to say uh day before yesterday maybe yesterday there were two churches by this time at the time of Jesus there was a believer at better sarkodie he was there for 38 years he never moved from his place God came to him the same God is here tonight amen you don't need to move from this church to other Church you must stay here amen stay with the world don't need to run anywhere God will come to you because God gave you a minister if God God ordained the minister then he will send his holy spirit amen see how to recognize the Holy Spirit by his acts yes how God will do by healings amen to to buy repenting their hearts see you need to repent when God comes to you see God will touch your heart see God wants to come inside of your heart so he will touch your heart you take it all things out from your heart that is what river will call you River will will clean your heart once Holy Holy Spirit comes to you it will clean and clean and clean your heart then he is able to come inside of you then he will live inside of you then he will guide instead of you amen amen for that I always says that maybe when you are in maybe you're a child then maybe your pastor dedicated you but now I'm asking you to rededicate yourself amen hallelujah experience then you have to rededicate yourself to God because you know what you did you know what you are doing now you know what what your trust inside of you so you must come forward to dedicate yourself yes then God can come inside of you amen
