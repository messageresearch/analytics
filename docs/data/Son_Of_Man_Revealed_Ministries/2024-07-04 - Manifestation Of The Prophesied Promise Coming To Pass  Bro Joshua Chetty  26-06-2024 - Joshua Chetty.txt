the body of Christ amen amen for you to ascend into that spiritual realm that you ought to be amen the prophet of God says that if we do not become adopted Sons then the child remains just a son amen we talk when we talk about adoption we are talking about Old Testament we're talking about the ancient law and not the modern law we have now amen so the danger is that though you be a son now is the time to become an adopted son the adoption speaks about Authority you're placing amen otherwise you walk around not realizing what you have now I'm not preaching tonight but if you read Luke chapter 15 you'll see there's two sons one goes into the world but he comes back home and he's adopted amen but there was a son who remained at home and he got upset because he was not living in his inheritance he father even told him son all that I have is yours but you never saw fit to use it so he didn't become an adopted son he just remained a son not knowing how to use his inheritance amen so the we'll praise the Lord amen just with that thought there we're can to invite our brother Joshua to come and share the word of the Lord amen hallelujah let's just sing a song as we invite our

under Saints of like Precious Faith amen and then you hear the worship and especially when you're coming from your workplaces and things like that it's soothing amen amen you got your Bibles we'll turn to the book of we got a few scriptures The Book of Psalms we'll start with the book of Psalms 80: 8 just one scripture there one verse there thou has brought a vine out of Egypt thou has cast out the Eden and planted it amen the Lord has taken us out of Egypt amen taken us out of every denominational system taken us out of Leia taking us out of the we the the world Amen the world system he's brought us out amen but he says he brought out a Vine amen amen yes he also called his bride the vine if he is the vine he must be part of him amen Luke uh also turn to the Book of Luke 1 verse 45 just one verse there yeah in Luke chapter 1 Mary is going to Elizabeth and then you know after Elizabeth is full of the Holy Ghost she's prophesying now and in 145 she speaking to Mary she said and blessed is she and that believed for there shall be a performance amen of those things which were told her from the Lord blessed is this Mary blessed is this bride amen amen for believing amen for there shall be a performance of those things which were told from the Lords amen all that was prophesied about her must come to pass amen there must be a manifestation of Prophecy amen amen there's a time when it's prophecy but when there must come a time where there must be a performance of the prophecy amen amen and the word of God shall not return not in void God says I am not man that I should lie amen amen we also turn to the Book of Revelation chapter 10 reading from verses 8 to 11 and the voice which are heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stand it upon the sea and upon the Earth the one that's oppressing the powers now amen right and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book give me my inheritance give me my title deed and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey amen you must partake of this word every part of this word you must eat it up amen you must eat this entire word that is given unto you amen amen and I took the little book because remember for you to become the final voice in the final age to become the authority on the earth amen you must eat all this book you must take the title de that gives you your Authority that gives you your right amen yes and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I eaten it in my my belly was butter and he said unto me now watch this part can only happen after you eating the book amen thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen amen because the word that you are eating must come to you must perform it amen amen it must manifest out amen amen that's how you prophesying again when all that you have eaten again from the book is now going to be manifested there must be a perform of it amen amen amen you may be seated sorry am amen so we speaking tonight for a little exaltation manifestation of the prophesied promise coming to pass amen amen there was always prophecies in the Bible and there was time when the prophecies had to be fulfilled yes amen but we speaking about our day and our time and our prophecy amen amen and this prophecy phy and the entire Bible if you look at it no matter what prophecy it was whether it was about I will send you sending whether it was to the children of Israel I will send you a deliverer when Joseph was telling them to them the Lord himself shall send a deliverer unto you amen right after 400 years that was prophecy but when Moses walks on the scene that prophecy coming to pass amen then asiah is prophesying a virgin shall conceive then when the angel appears to Mary and she said be unto me according to th word that proph prophecy coming to pass amen and when the Holy Ghost bir it there was a manifestation of that prophecy yes amen but the entire Bible had one purpose and one achievement amen amen it's one purpose and one achievement is Redemption is man coming back to his original condition amen man that has fallen in the Garden of Eden man that was put on the earth to be king of the earth amen yes that's why Satan when he lost the battle in heaven remember Michael defeated him Michael had two3 of the angels He had one3 of the Angels right and he was cast into the Earth then he took him a time with his demon powers to get this political system that's right demon powers in politics demon powers around the world systemen yes amen demon power in in science in education all over influencing man and we find that Satan now he had a purpose as well his purpose was to run this to have his kingdom on this Earth amen yes right so he had his kingdom now for 6,000 years I mean if it wasn't so Jesus could have told him when he offered it to Jesus he said if you bow down to me I give you the kingdomes Jesus could have told him you're lying it's not your kingdom Jesus didn't say that because he is the God of this evil age this is his kingdom but because Adam had for feet in it Satan lost the battle in heaven and now he came to Earth and what he did he couldn't get to Adam there was no way he would get to Adam so what he did he went to the byproduct of man he went to Eve yes and he received him and brought the fall of Man but from there God still had a purpose and his purpose was to restore B man to the original condition amen and Satan is thinking now he's ruling the Earth but God got a purpose God got a purpose that he'll have sons and daughters who will come back to rule and Reign upon this very Earth hallelujah oh don't you know the saint shall sh upon the ashes of the wicked amen people are trying to achieve all the things in this Earth all the wealth and all the kingdoms they're trying to deceive people and achieve all these things in politics and so forth but they don't realize everything is set for the bride yes that's right amen because this is our place amen this is our domain we have to have a domain yes yes amen this is our kingdom but yeah we're going to rule and reign with Christ amen amen but we are in this age of adoption we are to receive a spirit of adoption yes amen and we receive the spirit of adoption just before the time it comes to the changing of the body amen so from the time we received the spirit of adoption to the till we went the Redemption of our body waiting for the Redemption of our bodies now which is a final part of the adoption right because now you you can't go into the New Kingdom with this body yes because that's an that's an eternal Kingdom now yes amen so you need an eternal body and this body is corruption but it must put on incorruption that can take you to live to Eternity amen because the soul is already saved the soul is already redeemed the soul is eternal amen but the body needs to be changed amen but from the time we but before the changing of the body there must be Sons and Daughters of God that come to maturity amen amen that taken this book that has been partaking of this book that not satisfied who says I just got that this I got the the message of the hour I believe that God sent a prophet and I believe the church order and Doctrine and so forth no we're talking about people that realizes what Redemption truly is amen because when you see Christ the mysty of God you must See Redemption from Genesis to Revelation amen and you must see that you had a part to play from the Old Testament going all the way to the New Testament everything was a type and Shadow Of You am amen thank amen so this is the age where Sons and Daughters of God must bring fruit fruit to Perfection amen we must bring fruit coming to Perfection it is not good firstly those that bear no fruit in his hour will be cast out yes will be cut taken out and those that just bear fruit will be purged and that's not a bad thing because Sons and Daughters of God has chastized they are purged for the purpose of bearing for much fruit yes amen so when God is purging you he doesn't want to say I'm satisfied I got the message of the hour I believe the prophet I'm bearing fruit now here's my fruit I believe the message and I'm standing firm with this message for 20 years 30 years believing this message he wants you to Bear much fruit amen he wants you to bear fruit of perfection he wants you to manifest himself amen the very life of the vine must be shown forth amen amen IM imagine we had Jesus on the earth he was the complete word made flesh the fullness of the word he was working on the earth 2,000 years ago made flesh but in Acts chapter one it says the former treaties that are made o theophilos of all that Jesus began to do and teach so you never say just to teach what he says Jesus began to do and teach amen amen so he didn't just come and teach the word amen amen there had to be a performance amen amen amen there to be a performance of the word amen there to be a power and demonstration that this is not just man amen this is God Amen he's taking natural things right he's looking at natural circumstances in front of him and he's doing Supernatural things amen now every son and daughter of God must do the same if Christ is in him he's not walking just in his natural world like everybody else amen because you are now the word the fullness of the word has come in this day the fullness of the word is now in where in a many membered body it was God in human flesh 20 years ago God in a redeemed body in a prophet then where is God now because the part of Jes God in human flesh in Jesus Christ was done away with then he had to come in a prophet in a redeemed body but where is God now where is the manifestation of God now amen amen he now in full plain view in bright form amen want read this one quote before going he says wait till them seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who really can take the word of God and any day it will slice and cut and they can close the the evens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to now this is not an immature church amen yes amen now if people can't believe God for simple Miracles a to take how are they going to take this part of the word if people can't understand God is a supernatural God never walk in the Supernatural how are they going to take this part of the word now yes so he say no it was good for William Bram this is not for William brandham see what he says here wait till them seven UT voice to that group not talking about the one man Ministry who really can take the word of God and every there it will slice and cut and they can close the evens amen they can shut this or do that whatever they want to Glory he'll be slay by the word that proceed from his mouth is sharper than the two sword they could call for a 100 billion tons of flies if they wanted to but you see this is a mature Branch bunch of people they know what to do with the word amen whatever they say is going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God Amen now he say listen to what he's saying here whatever they say right but he saying it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God now is God speaking or is they speaking amen they are the veil yes but what's working inside the veil Beyond the Veil they are uttering the voice right it's their vocal cords but beyond that Veil if you look beyond that Veil amen what you say it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God Amen yes amen thank you Lord because that's what they receive in the hour the whole entire word of God coming from the M of God God always is his word but he always uses man to work it yes God could have called for them flies down there in Egypt but he said Moses that's your job I just tell you what to do and you'll do it he fully done that he could have chosen the sun to call him he could have caused the moon to call it and and the or the wind to call it but he said Moses he chose he chooses men all right so where has God ever changed God always uses man now for God to use us it takes a full surrender to God Amen in order for God for the fullness for the for the word of God to be manifested for there to be a manifestation of the word to us there must be a surrender amen and the perfect example is it the prophet was an example he was the first Chief in way before us in this day a man surrendered to God that God could use him cuz God said I got a work for you to do and when he was surrendered to God God could use him for that work but now there has to be others that follow there are to be other sons of God that come into adoption in this hour amen he was the son of Jesus was the son of God coming to adoption brother brandham was the son of God coming to adoption then there must be other sons of God whose names are in the book that must come to adoption in this hour and they must come to an hour because when they come to adoption and maturity then the world is going to see Sons and Daughters of God am amen then the world going to say that's an example of Christ that's an example of Jesus Christ upon the Earth that's why people many people never understood brother Bram they never believed some of them never believe what he said but they couldn't pick on his life they couldn't pick on the way he operated because they knew that God was with him so just like that people must know that God is with you amen so that's if that was an adopted son of God coming this age now we taking this book if our names are in the book we must be the adopted sons of God in this age it can't be for another age there is no other age for the Gentile church amen amen in fact we out of the ages now we are in the bright age amen because from here the gospel is going to go go back to the Jews yes amen amen but before the time it goes back to the Jews Sons and Daughters of God are coming to adoption yes and what is bringing them to maturity and adoption it is the preaching of the word amen because God ordained the fivefold ministry for that purpose am but it was all prophecy prophesied and God's word must come to pass so the five for is going to Echo that prophecy to you over and over again the true fire Ministry 54 Ministry is going to show you your part of the prophecy amen the true five for Ministry is going to show you what is the purpose of that prophecy for you what is the purpose where he said you'll be an invincible Army yeah what is the purpose of him saying you'll be a super church amen you'll be a super race yes is what to get you ready set up for his kingdom amen yes Amen to bring you back to what was lost in the Garden of Eden that is the purpose yes the purpose the entire Bible is a story of redemption if you can take every part of the Bible from gen take every every prophecy every major prophet every minor prophet take all the the books of job and everything everything is about the bride and he's Redemptive everything shows you God's Plan of Redemption amen amen and Redemption is not just for you because now God is dealing with you now but remember when he takes us to the weding supper then he must renovate the Earth am amen he must he must redeem Fallen Adam Fallen Eve and Fallen God's three4 mystery amen so we receive this word in in its fullness and as we partaking of it as we eating of it amen you are what you eat yes yes amen if you want to become healthy and strong you got to have good protein amen amen you got to have a good diet amen and if you're having a good diet is going to make you a good healthy person amen now if you're a person that living that when you see the world you seeing it more from the from your carnal nature and you're looking at the world through your eyes you're living narrow-minded in your own world in your own eyes you're narrow-minded but you're not seeing the through God's eyes which is a bigger picture yes which is Redemption for the for everything and his old plan amen amen God's Plan of Redemption and you're not seeing this body this bride in a body amen you living in this narrow-minded world then how are you going to be fruitful how are you going to be a fruitful Vine that he must come and prune you amen there must be a pruning time in your life because God wants you to be fruitful yes God wants you to live a blessed life amen he wants you to live an Abundant Life yes and now when we talk about abundance people automatically think about worldly abundance no God talking about I'm talking about all of God's blessings everything amen where you live like a king on the earth because why you look you're thinking of your original condition there's a revelation that you receive and true Revelation firstly you receive this Revelation I'm an IM I cannot die I've already passed from Death unto life amen right that's once you have that fear is gone and the Bible said perfect love casted away all fear so when you have a revelation that I cannot die I passed already from Day Life what what all that Satan has over you so that's gone then he's going to give you you can't be lost yes because once you say once you are sealed with the Holy Ghost you can't you are sealed until the day of redemption then you know your salvation is secure then that fear is gone you see this is not denomination of baby teaching now amen amen you can't get this in denomination people are keep going to the altar confessing hoping that they'll be saved hoping that much the more they repent the more they'll be saved yeah you haven't done it in the first place you have that Revelation amen now we never had that under a denominational concept yes you have to come in the message of the hour amen amen amen because why a prophet have to go in the back part of God's mind to to show you that you always was with him oh yes and if you always was with him you cannot end see amen you always existed with him and he goes beyond that there's a feminist part of God which is part of he cannot be separated from it's it's makeup it's part of his attributes amen so you are connected with him amen that is why in this hour when he come say Adam Adam where are thou he said Lord I am here to have fellowship with you I am here to cry AB father and commune with you amen you're not running away from him anymore amen amen because now you are under the blood you're under the token in the hour and you are washed By the Waters of the words thank you Lord amen you're not running away from his presence trying to S yourself some fig leaves yes amen you're not covering it up with some form of religion but you can have fellowship with him any time amen that's why he took his son in his hour that come to adoption and said now walk with me oh yes amen amen now that's the Enoch work that is adopted Sons coming to that work amen where your lord can come and walk with you he doesn't have to come look for you Adam Adam where are th amen because yeah you are fellowshipping with him amen you are walking with him you are communing with him amen amen so every word that was prophesied of this bride that she'll be a sinless potless bride that she'll be a super Church she'll be a you got to take that part of the book you got to eat it up and when you eat it up it must come to pass amen amen there must be a performance of it yes because thou must prophesy you're prophesy your part that's a performance of it amen amen but it all depends on your diet what you eating if you're going to eat from the EST diet and you want to be like the Jones you want to be like everybody else and just just be happy to have said we have received the message of the hour and if that satisfies you that that just good for you and you're just bearing fruit but God wants you to Bear much fruit he wants you to bear fruit to perfection in this hour amen amen we are Marching to Perfection he wants Sons and Daughters Amen to manifest his word amen he want sons and daughters who can stand up for his his words yes amen Was Not Afraid amen of what anyone says amen when God put Adam in and Eve there in the in the Garden of Eden amen everything had to obey Adam yes amen everything have to wait every all nature had to wait for Adam's instruction amen and he had his Queen there amen everything was in harmony there was no problem with Adam and Eve there was no problem with the animals there was no animals fighting the lion and lamb was perfect amen yes Hallelujah there was no decaying of the leaves in like how you get in different seasons now there was no leaves for dying off amen there was no weeds in the ground everything was perfect so just like that God is bringing this bride now he's changing your Earth right now the first thing he's doing is making you have dominion over your Earth amen this Earth yes amen the first thing God is play you see sometime we say oh Satan is coming in my mind Satan is that Satan's coming your mind you have this old nature Satan is playing on their own nature so he comes on the Battleground yes because you already remember the flesh is already from the sinful nature we already inherited that to the birth the natural birth to the first birth we already inherited the sticky nature and then Satan knows what to do now he comes in a battleground of the mind right there when Jesus was on the earth he showed us what to do with Satan when he comes to tackle you in your mind you have to go back to the word and give him back the word yesen don't qu in carnally right you will lose every time yes you do not fight with flesh and blood but with powers and principalities and rulers of Darkness do not fight with Satan on Satan's grounds yes you will just end up a mess and you will lose on his Turf you need to fight with him in your Turf we are now seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are like eagles amen we fight in the air in the heavenlies amen we fight a spiritual battle amen so you defeat him there amen with the word yes amen you give him back the word amen that is why you got to be part you got to eat this book you got to be part of the book you can't prophesy if you're not eating of this book amen amen how are you going to prophesy again all you be prophesying is carnal things you'll be speaking caral things amen we find that Satan has had his church God has done with all the ages but at the end of all ages now when God was bringing his bride into Plain View amen we know that Satan is also 2 million demons on the Earth but what is your worst demon that you can face now is your religious demons don't think Satan has not Advanced himself listen when Satan when the nicadan spirit started yeah right he crept in the church he kept in the original Church yes there was a Holy Ghost full Church and then it came all the way it went to the Dark Ages then you had Luda then it still crept in lud's message then you had Wesley it's still crep in there then you had the Pentecostal Lady it's still crep in there and then you had the message of the hour don't think it don't C creep in there because he said in the framework of the message amen this SE will be so close amen yes amen till he'll receive the very elected if possible do not think that people are not established in the message do not think people are just there there are no churches that people are set in the ways but the fruit you shall know them amen we are not satisfied then it serves no purpose if we want to just be set in a ways and we got an established we we believe everything but we're not moving in per we're not moving in progression now if the Holy Ghost Church the book of Acts was the act of the Holy Ghost right in the original Church and he said there must be a continuation of the book of Acts if there was a powerful church and if from there to now there's no progression then there's something wrong amen yes but we thank God that he's showing us he's positionally placing us amen amen that's what the true preaching of the word come to do is positionally placing you amen that is why when you sit in church when you look at your brother and sister when you look at the preacher look Beyond the Veil amen you must understand when God is talking to you he's talking to you for a purpose I don't think I don't think we living in a age where people want to preach flowery sermons he's not going to do anything for us we want to preach something and believe something okay ask yourself this one question whatever you do in life is that relevant to Give Me rapturing Faith just ask yourself the one question am I doing this thing in life am I understanding this is it giving me rapturing Faith because our purpose is to leave the Earth our purpose is to make the Rapture amen but before we have the Final Redemption of the body there must be a display amen of sons and God adopted to God Sons and Daughters adopted in sour amen there must be a final display amen there must be an ins sign there's always been an ins sign there must be an ins sign in this hour and that is a bride coming to adoption in the hour amen we could look at our Mark and say look at this was a prophet of God and we could see God in that man everything we talk about we see God in that man that was our example of God in a man in the hour so we must attain to people must see God in us and say God in that man God in that sister yes when you speak to somebody have you ever spoke life into somebody and said and then the person said to you that not you speaking that is God [Music] speaking amen John 15 says I am the True Vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruit he take it away and every branch that beared fruit he purged it that it may bring forth more fruit amen so God is Not Just satisfied with you having just fruit he wants more fruit amen so he doesn't want you to just be stagnant in your work yes there must be a progression in your work amen I mean brought this message to show you that I'm going to be setting up another kingdom and you are going to be my queen in the kingdom hallah and don't you know the same shall judge the Earth that people are going come to a judgment in the white Throne judgment you'll be sitting there as a judge and don't you know that he that gave a glass of water to one of these my little one shall not surely not lose the rewards amen don't you know the grace that you have to share amen the mercy that you have to share just because you are the bride because of people's association with you for the good deed that they did to you they only lose their reward you're not just any type of people on the earth now how much more for the people that do bad to you as well it's better than a milstone should be put upon them amen so he says now ye clean to the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of s except you abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abided in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned but if abide in me and my words abide in you they shall ask what you will and it shall be done done unto you here in my father is glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples you see how God is glorified when you bear for much fruit amen amen so when people see God in you God is glorified when the people see Christ in you God is glorified amen but if the people see your sticky nature and they see the old condition the adamic condition how is God going to be glorified yes amen amen so if you want God to be glorified in this you must display his nature amen amen you must display his attributes amen now watch what he says here the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Apostles yes read and known of all men for their generation what he says people who took his Revelation from God they became the Living Word the living Apostles right when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone through the years until in this last day there is G again another people in the land who under their messenger yes will be the final voice to the final age amen yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it his own mouthpiece so God is turning on Earth he will confound her to the prophet and the bribes now when the prophet was on the earth whenever you had God a prophet on the earth the prophet will tell the state what to do the prophet will tell either bring judge pronounce judgment to the state or pronounce something but they will say what what must happen but the church and state don't mix together now if we are to be the final mouthpiece of God we will dictate what happens on the earth we should be telling the people what is to become on the earth so if you want while you on the earth if you want a blessing if you want something you can speak it you can prophesy amen amen you have the authority to speak it like Esther spoke amen you can change the decree of the laws of the land while you are here because let me tell you something the reason why everything is okay right now is because of the Bride is suppressing the powers amen amen so Grace is on the Earth because of you yes but the minut you leave the Earth from the false prophet it goes into the Beast amen and then Satan incarnate into a pope right now he just the false prophet but he's going to change and then watch what's going to happen on the Earth when the bride leaves the Earth so he says so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her so where's the voice of God now amen amen where's the voice of God so what are we speaking when the world sees us are we speaking like them are we joining them in all the negative things they say or we have hope or we are people that can prophesy yes life amen a people that can pray for the sick and they will recover yes a people are not afraid no matter what the doctors told them it can be cancer it can be death but you are able to speak to the sickness amen that you are able to you're not afraid of the circumstances the only time you'll be afraid to go pray for someone that is sick if you don't have faith to believe that they'll be healed amen but he says for the voice of God will be in there yes if it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come amen once more the world will he direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be reputated as in the first age yes amen now he cried now he has cried out to this last age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever now we can say we've got the whole opening of the word I want you to take it to us now we've got the entire word open to us right the Seven Seals have been opened amen the seven Thunders have Ed their voices you have more by we have all the messages amen we have them in book form we have them in tape form we have them in digital form amen and we have the fivefold ministry around the world but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and acing it into pieces so God don't want that he doesn't want us to divide he doesn't want to debate about the word debate of different doctrines into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want don't take out any Scripture amen don't take out the scripture that day in the Bible don't say there was for another day don't say that was good for the days of the Prophet amen he said taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want maybe you don't have the gift for that or you don't have the faith for that but don't take it out don't take out from the word amen if you don't have faith to believe the word don't take it out of the word maybe that someone else will have faith for it pray for the brother you are not interested in living it but debating it I would sooner you were called Art now he's speaking to letter but I'm getting something to you here we have the fullness of the word we saying we might have all the word but they also telling us leave the leave the preaching of the word just push play they are telling us different things we don't want to debate anymore we got no time for that we are in a Battle Ground here amen and the battle is Raging amen the battle is Raging you got 200 million demon disguise in different forms amen you got them in the churches you got them in politics you got them all over amen so we got no time to debate we got no time to fuss that is why you find a true son and daughter of God always the prophet of God can prophesy the word and he goes goes away you got no time to fast with them he gives them the word and he just goes away he doesn't fast for them and make them you want to believe this no he does he got no time to talk he just come and do amen but when you simply take my word and don't honor it I in return must refuse to honor you now he told us to the lean age let us not make that same mistake when he's given us all the word amen we got to manifest our parts amen the man there must be a manifestation of our part of the word now you can't have the word from 1965 till the prophet go off the scene from that time to now the word has stor up stor up and then the word was going around the world we can't have the word and going to the hour of the rapture but the bride hasn't made an impact on the earth amen yes that's the fact there must be an impact the people must recognize that the authority of the church or the authority of the word is in the brides amen amen yes the authority of scripture is with the bride yes no one can debate on scripture the authority of the scripture must be with the bride amen amen and all the workings of the Holy Ghost must be in the bride amen all nine spiritual gifts must be in the brides all gifts of the Spirit must be displayed among the bride all seven virtues must be in the brides amen no one else should be no one else has the authority in he said she be his mouthpiece God said that so every other voice who speaks don't have authority to speak amen every voice must be shut up amen but when she speaks she's speaking with authority because he has ordained it amen he said she'll be his mouthpiece amen so all that was prophesied must be manifested in this hour amen amen he said now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts yes but the Book of Revelation shows out that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it make it luk Wang formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and wi the Antichrist Spirits you can't be living this hour without discernment amen you must be able to discern the spirits and how you do that God has put the Watches Over You amen that's why he has Watchmen amen God has Watchmen true Watchmen who can discern what they put there for a purpose to discern the spirit that will come in the church that will come and so seeds of the stenes amen he said Satan will be powerless before he will be as definitely twed today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hats revelation but we love it amen with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against us but we will prevail against over it amen in this last quote just want to give you the prophet is giving an illustration about a fire the this Winchester firearm that he had and when he shot it it managed to shoot a certain distance but when he rode up to them they said he cannot go there but he's saying I know he did that so he's saying here I started to shoot the squirrel I find out I hit him somewhere else beside in the high I got nervous I tried again on paper and it wouldn't eat the target it would hit within or quarter of an inch or half an inch something at 50 yards but I know it would do better than that I done everything to the gun that I know how to do and nothing seemed to fix up right so I wrapped it up in a box sent it back to the Winchester company for Examination for rebedding they wrote me an nice letter I have my file at home and said Reverend brandham that rifle would Will Group an inch in a 25 yards said is just a model 75 it's not a Target gun it's just a little plinker and said you'll never get any better than that now that was the Winchester company that made the gun said every an inch and 25 yards and I drove nine straight OES in 50 yards now here's my thought my wife said now look B she said if the company who made the rifle will just say that and and it won't do no better than that then who are you to say that I said honey here is what it is I don't care what the company says I've seen it do it and I know it'll do it and I sat down there when the other Brethren were shooting squirrels anyway they wanted to hit them was all right m center back anyway I sat under a tree and I was crying I said God I'm so nervous I can't hold myself together why did you make me a little nervous fellow like this and I realize when I'm standing here the before me and a voice just as plain as you would hear mind said you were made thus for a purpose because until you know that the rifle is going to zero once because if it's zero once rather it will Zero again it's the same rifle amen therefore I see if you're obeying this word taking this original taking this range finder and bring it down to a place till I can see the same thing those apostles saw the same gospel they preach it will produce the same results so if the same word that brother Brandon was seeing and he's seeing the results and we have received his word today amen we believe this word amen that we must see the same results amen amen amen you got to zero it in because we got this range finder amen you got to follow the guid in this hour amen if you follow the guide he going to lead you the same every time thank you Lord amen now you find that some people are trying to find the guide the wrong way they don't you see the guide doesn't work like that like how people think some people are not under edip they can't submit to Authority they can't submit to a edip when God has placed edip in the church and God has set them as Watchman over the church amen and that's how the guide is working if you're not sitting under Authority how you going to of the guides God has always put man and man to lead the people amen and the man is leading the people in this hour to get them ready for Rapture he's showing them how they can come to their position amen but if we going to be people that now we just going to be at home I'll play the tape I've got the message of the hour I'll just follow the thing here and I don't want to submit to any Authority but I've got the tape how is that following God's plan for the age amen then you're taking out scripture you cannot take out the word Ephesians 4 says I have gave some to be Apostles some to be pastors and the prophet of God says the pastor is the highest Authority in the church and your pastor will see you through now show me where did he ever come and take that out [Music] amen the church remember the church is the female right he's typing the female and she has to be under agship yes just like in the home if the woman is not under the headship of the husband then she's not under God she's not obeying God at all amen she's not under Authority so if the female doesn't want to be in a church or congregation doesn't want to be in a church and just going maybe Church hopping and don't want to be under submission or listening to the message at home they're not under submission so they don't have a headen they're not obeying their head so he says but if he is God ever God he is still God he always was God and he can be nothing else but God and he's God Eternal therefore we want to look to the Target now what Target the church is shooting at but sorry not what Target the church is shooting at but what Target that Christ is shooting at we look for Christ to appear appear the same Jesus he said when he was on earth a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you to the end of the world the same one who could direct the word and the word direct it right straight onto the Target that same Lord Jesus is here this morning in the form of the Holy Spirit to direct our thoughts and focus down to his word to one true and living God to one purpose and to one achievement amen and if he'll just let him do it he will focus the word right into a place that will prove that he the same yesterday today and forever thank you Lord depends on what you want to look at now it's good to say God God is with us but God has moved from God above us God With Us now he moved to God in us amen so when it's God in us we are now the mouthpiece of God that when you speak it is God speaking through you amen amen that's why when you see your brother look Beyond the Veil when you look at your sister look Beyond the Veil when you look at the 5old ministry look Beyond the Veil amen know that God is speaking amen this last quote when a man confesses his sins and gets right with God and God drops the sin of his convention into the blood of his own blood and forgives that sin and he places in that man the original spirit that should be in there paragraph 83 his own Spirit making him a Son of God how much more ought the creative power of God to be in the church amen it breaks down every wall of sin it breaks down people today today try to say those words was back for another age it is if you still out from under that blood but if you're under the blood the power of God by his word Remains the Same it's got to be the same if he could do that by the blood of sheep and animals what about the blood of Jesus Christ how he could do it we must cope our lives and focus it to the word of God just like that we would a picture camera or try to get the right Focus before we snap it and then we got the real true picture that's what we want to do to focus our lives into Jesus Christ amen this Christ that Christ and you become the same person you you are a son adopted to God by the blood of the righteous Jesus Christ then the church would be moving on without friction without Earth without arm without doubts without Scruples without friction it will be moving in the power of the word of God manifesting every divine blessing that God promised to it if it just do that you see if it just do that if the church do that then he' be moving to the power of God manifesting every divine blessing amen so this is the age of adoption amen amen this is the age where Sons and Daughters of God have received the the spirit of adoption because they come to do the Greater Works amen this is the age way do prophesy there'll be an invincible Army amen amen amen because why she won't compromise with the word of God yes amen she will defeat Satan with the same word amen she has the word within her that's what makes her an invincible army yes Satan cannot defeat her because she's got the word in her and she's going to defeat him with the same word amen and with the same word she'll be able to do the Greater Works amen amen and she's able to have discernment in his hour to discern the true Spirits amen amen because all she's interested is that she's interested in caring about the father's business amen amen let's stand [Applause] amen have let's think that song we climbing up seven steps to perfection [Music] [Music] climing [Music] up I'm up I
