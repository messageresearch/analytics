[1:29] Lord, it's a work that you have already
[1:31] done upon the cross of Calvary, Lord.

[1:36] we know tonight we have rightful claims
[1:39] to claim our redemptive blessings,
[1:41] Father. It's a work that you have done.
[1:44] And right now, we claim our healing in

[1:56] Lord Jesus.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; And if the Holy Ghost is here right now
[2:00] and Lord, we learn to God that his
[2:02] sicknesses come from germs and diseases
[2:04] which are Lord come from spirits, oh
[2:06] God. And we pray right now that your
[2:08] Holy Spirit will drive out the spirit in
[2:11] the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; They have no rightful place over the
[2:15] children of God.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, we claim healing over bodies tonight
[2:20] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ name.
[2:23] Oh, we believe your word, Lord. We don't
[2:25] want to believe the word of man, but we
[2:27] believe your word, oh God. We believe
[2:29] your report, oh God,
[2:31] &gt;&gt; and your report is a finished work, oh
[2:32] God.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; You see our imperfection, oh God. Lord,
[2:36] &gt;&gt; oh blessed be your wonderful name. Lord,
[2:39] we know, we are so grateful, oh God,
[2:41] that you, Lord, come down to be touched
[2:43] by the feelings of our infirmities, oh
[2:45] God.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; You know every need of your children, oh
[2:48] God. You know the things that we have
[2:50] need of. And Lord, we know that you want
[2:53] to meet with every need, oh God.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're a father that loves us so
[2:57] much.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you want to provide for your
[3:00] children, oh God. You want to give us
[3:02] all the things that we have need of, for
[3:04] God,
[3:04] &gt;&gt; because Lord, you've given us every
[3:06] promise in your word. Nothing you
[3:08] withheld from us, oh God.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; Tonight, as we've come, Lord, we submit
[3:12] to you. We yield to you, oh God, and we
[3:15] pray that you'll come and speak to our
[3:17] hearts, oh God. Let it be a refreshing
[3:19] of your Holy Spirit, oh God. Let your
[3:21] anointing come upon your people, oh God,
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[3:24] &gt;&gt; through the preaching of your word. And
[3:26] Lord, when we go from this place, we
[3:28] will know, Lord, there's been a
[3:30] refreshing in the mighty name of Jesus
[3:33] Christ.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Greet you all, saints of God, in
[3:38] the wonderful name of our Lord and
[3:40] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; Uh we know sometimes we get tired, we
[3:47] get weary in the flesh.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because we are in the special
[3:50] house.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; But we come to get refreshed
[3:54] &gt;&gt; in the presence of God.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We come to get filled. Amen.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; With his spirit more and more of him.
[4:02] Amen.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; And we know that when when we have this
[4:05] refreshing, it revives us.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we come in this midweek
[4:09] meeting to get revived again. Amen.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; And when we get revived, we go on and we
[4:14] start burning with the fire of God.
[4:16] Amen.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:19] So therefore we we've come and we and
[4:21] and we're not just gathered anyway.
[4:23] We're gathered with saints of like
[4:25] precious faith.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; We we are gathering with with those that
[4:28] love and hold dear to this wonderful
[4:30] message.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; That all the things of God dear to the
[4:33] hearts. Amen.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; That love God and love his word. Amen.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; So we got our Bibles. We turn to the
[4:44] book of 1 Corinthians
[4:46] reading from chapter 2 verse 5.
[4:53] That's a short exhortation tonight that
[4:56] you'll be blessed. Amen.
[4:59] &gt;&gt; That your faith
[5:02] should not stand
[5:05] in the wisdom of men.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; But in the power of God. Amen.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; And uh the scripture Revelation 10:1,
[5:19] please don't get tired of the scripture.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; This is an important scripture,
[5:25] instrumental scripture in the message of
[5:27] the hour.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Because the scripture takes us, this is
[5:31] our seven seal scripture. This is a
[5:35] scripture that shows us that this was
[5:38] the time when a message has come our
[5:40] way. Amen.
[5:43] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[5:46] from heaven clothed with a cloud.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; And a rainbow was upon his head, and his
[5:52] face was as it were the sun, and his
[5:54] feet as pillars of fire. And he had in
[5:57] his hand a little book open, and he set
[6:00] and he set his right foot upon the sea,
[6:02] and his left foot on the earth, and
[6:04] cried with a loud voice, as when a lion
[6:07] roared. And when he had cried, seven
[6:10] thunders uttered their voices.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; This scripture is not for everybody.
[6:14] It's for a peculiar people.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's for a people that was going
[6:18] to be upon the earth that will receive
[6:20] title.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; It's not just for everybody. Amen. Amen.
[6:24] You may be seated.
[6:27] Just for a short, I just want to speak
[6:29] on the prophet spoke this message,
[6:32] wisdom versus faith.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:36] wisdom versus faith. But we speak on the
[6:39] supernatural message of Revelation 10:1.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that this is a
[6:44] supernatural message.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; This is a message that you don't get out
[6:49] from any seminary.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; From any man-made doctrine.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Not from some theologian.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or not by some man's intellectual
[6:58] understanding of the scriptures.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural message.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's for a supernatural people.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; A people that want eternal thoughts of
[7:10] God
[7:11] &gt;&gt; until God expressed his thoughts that
[7:14] they could be manifested upon the earth.
[7:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. A people that walks out of his of
[7:20] his spoken words.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; That walks out of the scriptures.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:28] So we are seeing we are living in an
[7:30] hour where it's an intellectual age.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; Now we know to the teaching of the
[7:39] prophet of God and to the message of the
[7:41] hour we we don't believe in ignorance.
[7:44] We don't teach ignorance.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; But this is the type of wisdom we try to
[7:48] the when the prophet is speaking about
[7:50] this type of wisdom. It's the wisdom
[7:52] that will go against God
[7:56] &gt;&gt; because the things of God must be
[7:58] believed by faith. For without faith, it
[8:01] is impossible to please God.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And faith is a revelation.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; And it is the grace of God that gives
[8:11] you faith.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't just go and say, "I want
[8:15] faith."
[8:15] &gt;&gt; It is the grace of God that gives you
[8:18] revelation. Amen.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; I was just mentioning tonight I was
[8:22] looking at a family and I was telling my
[8:23] wife and how how I how I come in in the
[8:26] message in the early stages of coming to
[8:28] the message and there were three of us
[8:31] that went into the voice of God library
[8:33] to get message material.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; But from the three of us that went in, I
[8:39] was the only one that stayed in.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not because I had any
[8:45] intellectual understanding better than
[8:46] them. They were well informed of the
[8:49] scriptures.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; They were well learned in the scriptures
[8:52] and they to their understanding they
[8:54] loved they they claim to love God.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; But I was predestinated for a purpose.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; The eyes of my understanding was
[9:04] enlightened.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; God had to open my understanding to see
[9:08] the time and hour that we living in
[9:11] &gt;&gt; to recognize my day and my message.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It had nothing to do with me.
[9:16] Amen.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; But I was predestinated for that hour.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I began to see my day and
[9:23] my message and the word rapture caught
[9:25] caught my attention that I knew that I
[9:27] always belong to this. This is part of
[9:30] me. Amen.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; This is the real me. Amen.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; So, this message is not something
[9:38] insignificant.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; You coming across this message is the
[9:42] most supernatural thing that ever
[9:44] happened in your life. Amen.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God has intended for you
[9:49] to come across this message because this
[9:51] message has a word to translate your
[9:54] body.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing else is going to translate your
[9:56] body. The best medicines are going to
[9:58] translate your body. The best doctor,
[10:00] they can do all this genetic transfer
[10:03] and so forth and they're trying to do
[10:04] change the DNA and so forth. They cannot
[10:08] change your body.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; But we have a living word. Amen. Amen.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; In the wilderness there to survive, they
[10:18] had to have heavenly food, spiritual
[10:21] mana.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, mana from heaven. Amen. Angel
[10:24] food.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; For us to survive, the spirit man to
[10:27] survive because it's an eternal being.
[10:29] Amen.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; It has to have spiritual food.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; What makes us the eternal beings is the
[10:36] eternal God dwelling in us.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. when the great Holy Ghost, the
[10:42] eternal being dwelling in us
[10:45] &gt;&gt; and to know that we are always being a
[10:48] part of him.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; In you is coded in your DNA. The the
[10:55] supernatural things of God.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; It's already coded in your genetic DNA.
[11:00] Amen.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; Because you are partakers of his divine
[11:04] nature that was predestinated.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop that. Nothing would
[11:09] have stopped you from believing this
[11:11] message.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; If you're predestinated. Amen.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; God work in times and seasons.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; And therefore you find you find
[11:20] sometimes when you look at life and you
[11:22] look at people and say look at that
[11:24] person who will never believe this
[11:25] message. They are so messed up. And then
[11:27] we are we're judging it with the eyes of
[11:29] man. We say no but this person they
[11:32] going to they going to church regularly.
[11:34] They are attending service regularly.
[11:36] Maybe if I go to that person, they would
[11:38] believe the message.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; You see, you're looking at it through
[11:41] wisdom of man.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; You're looking at it in the wrong way.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; When God can take the violent sinner,
[11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; and transform his life.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Look at Peter at all. God did not Jesus
[11:53] did not look at him as man saw them.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; Peter was a vulgar person.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; He was there the fisherman. He was a
[12:01] rough man.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; But Jesus looked beyond that. Amen.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus is by predestination. Amen.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; We do not see man as the way man sees
[12:10] it.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; You got to look at it by discernment
[12:12] through the eyes of God's word. Amen.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; When Samuel went to choose uh David as
[12:18] king when he was looking at all the
[12:20] other sons of Jesse, they all most of
[12:24] them fit the profile for him for
[12:26] according to man's concepts.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; But there came a ry boy that was
[12:31] predestinated for a purpose. Yes.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That will change the cause of
[12:36] history in Israel.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; That will become a king that through
[12:41] that same throne. Amen. Come come the
[12:43] lineage of Jesus Christ.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:50] So there there we are right now seated
[12:54] right now and we are believing what we
[12:57] believe not through man's intellect.
[12:59] Amen.
[13:01] So we're looking at life man is
[13:03] believing on intellectual
[13:06] intellectual faith.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; What is intellectual faith? Satan if for
[13:12] Eve to for people to believe Satan
[13:15] they have they have to have some faith
[13:16] in him but it's not the faith of God.
[13:18] What I mean they have confidence in what
[13:20] they believe. They holding confidence to
[13:22] their wisdom.
[13:24] And people is holding confidence to
[13:26] man-made wisdom.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; And they are trying to interpret a
[13:31] supernatural message.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; With manmade wisdom.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; With man intellect, you cannot interpret
[13:41] the message that God send
[13:43] supernaturally.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to come in the same
[13:48] atmosphere.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; You've got to come in the atmosphere of
[13:51] the composer.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to be one with the
[13:54] composer.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; You got to be aligned with this. Amen.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; You got to come into alignment. Your
[14:00] life got to come into alignment of the
[14:02] composer. Amen.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; That's bringing this message.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; You got to come in such alignment that
[14:08] you are coming to oneness with him.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; And then you can have his mind. Amen.
[14:13] And then you can know what's on the back
[14:14] part of God's mind.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Where you no longer see yourself and
[14:18] every other person upon the earth.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:22] So you find that many people you find
[14:25] that they were not predestinated to
[14:28] receive this
[14:32] and they'll say they will say you words
[14:33] like I am leaving this message
[14:38] &gt;&gt; but we don't you know that it was
[14:40] already spoken of in the Bible that
[14:42] there must be a falling away.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; And there must be a plucking angel.
[14:47] Amen.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; To come and plug them out.
[14:52] So it's another man's made idea. This
[14:54] message, it's not a something that a
[14:58] person named William Brandom came and
[15:00] thought of this great idea. I'll bring a
[15:01] message to the people.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. This is a message from
[15:05] another world.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural message.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Mighty angel comes down from heaven.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; But before that, there had to be a work
[15:15] of redemption.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. There had to be a process of
[15:19] redemption.
[15:21] and a kinsman work to be done
[15:24] before this message can come upon the
[15:26] earth.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:32] So the danger of it is men are trying to
[15:34] interpret it with human wisdom.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; But this message can only be received by
[15:40] faith.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; Two seeds.
[15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Eden sets the stage. starts right there.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The tree people want to invest
[15:53] their time from the tree of knowledge.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Instead of the tree of life,
[16:00] &gt;&gt; which is now open freely.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The cherubs are no block no longer
[16:05] blocking the tree of life.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; They are come they are open freely now
[16:10] if you come in the right way.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come in the right way. Repent
[16:15] every one of you. Be baptized in the
[16:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[16:18] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[16:20] Ghost.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the sh open. Amen.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Opens you now to the book of Acts. To
[16:26] the supernatural. Amen. To the power of
[16:29] God.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; But what they doing? What is man doing?
[16:33] Man is reasoning.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; He's looking at circumstances,
[16:39] &gt;&gt; but faith is resting on God's words.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the book of John chapter 10
[16:46] verse one it says
[16:48] from book of John chapter 10 1-5 says
[16:51] verily verily I say unto you he that
[16:55] enterth not by the door into the
[16:58] sheepfold but climbth up some other way.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; The same is a thief and a robber.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; But he that enterth by the door is the
[17:08] shepherd of the sheep.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. To him the porter openeth, and the
[17:14] sheep hear his voice.
[17:17] And he calleth his own sheep by name,
[17:21] and leadth them. And when he puteth
[17:24] forth his own sheep, he goeth before
[17:26] them, and the sheep follow him.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; For they know his voice,
[17:34] &gt;&gt; and the stranger will they not follow,
[17:37] but will flee from him. For they know
[17:39] not the voice of strangers.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; The voice will come with a seed of
[17:44] discrepancy.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; The voice will come to make you reason
[17:47] with the words.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; The voice that comes to make you weaken
[17:50] your faith.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; But you won't follow that voice. If you
[17:54] are part of, if you know the shepherd,
[17:56] Amen. If you know him, the word, you'll
[17:58] follow the words.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; And a stranger will he not follow but
[18:04] will flee from him. For they know not
[18:06] the voice of strangers. They don't know
[18:09] any other voice. They only know the
[18:11] voice of God in this hour. Amen. When
[18:14] God is speaking through his words,
[18:17] the this parable spake Jesus unto them,
[18:19] but they understood not what things they
[18:22] were which he spake unto them. Then said
[18:25] Jesus unto them again, verily, verily, I
[18:29] say unto you, I am the door of the
[18:31] sheep.
[18:33] All that ever came before me are thieves
[18:36] and robbers.
[18:38] But the sheep do not hear them. I am the
[18:41] door. By me, if any man enter in, he
[18:44] shall be saved and shall go in and out
[18:47] and find pasture.
[18:50] He says, "The thief cometh not but for
[18:52] steal and to kill and destroy."
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; I am come that they might have life and
[18:58] they might have it more abundantly.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen. This message has come
[19:04] that we might have life and have it more
[19:06] abundantly.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; But the enemy wants to come and take you
[19:12] away from the things of God. He want to
[19:13] steal and destroy.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; But God is giving you a word of life.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; He's giving you an abundant life. He's
[19:20] giving you a message that will give you
[19:22] abundant life.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's giving you a message
[19:26] that's going to take you out of the
[19:27] earth.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; That's going to translate your body.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the the enemy is trying now to
[19:31] come and steal and destroy that word.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; But he cannot destroy that word
[19:36] &gt;&gt; because it's an eternal word because he
[19:39] said heaven and earth will pass away but
[19:41] my word will still remain. He said let
[19:44] every man's word be a lie but my word be
[19:47] the truth.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; He said I am the good shepherd.
[19:57] The good shepherd given his life for the
[19:59] sheep.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; But he that is in high ling
[20:05] and not the shepherds whose own sheep
[20:08] are not seeth the wolf coming and
[20:10] leaveth the sheep and fleth and the wolf
[20:13] catcheth them and scattered the sheep.
[20:17] You see if I can put this in a context
[20:18] in in now in in ministry you'll find
[20:22] that
[20:24] if your ministry don't have discernments
[20:26] and they see discrepancies coming in and
[20:29] they will leave the sheep to be with all
[20:31] the discrepancies
[20:33] but a a true ministry that the true five
[20:36] ministry would have discernment in this
[20:38] hour.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Will see the seed of the steppy coming
[20:40] in.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; And they will recognize the steppy.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he will protect the sheep from
[20:46] discrepancy.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz God has put the true five-fold
[20:49] ministry. Cuz he is the true shepherd.
[20:51] Amen. And he must be here amongst them.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; It must be Christ leading the five-fold
[20:57] ministry.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. The mighty angel must be here
[21:02] amongst our midst
[21:04] &gt;&gt; discerning every spirit. Amen.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Discerning the spirit in the framework
[21:08] of the message.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Those that will use wisdom instead of
[21:13] faith. Those that will take reasoning,
[21:15] those that will reason with the word of
[21:17] God, those that will misre misrepresent
[21:20] the word of God, mislocate the word of
[21:22] God. Amen.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Misinterpreted.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; So he is hiding and not the shepherd
[21:32] whose own the sheep are not. Seth the
[21:34] wolf coming and leave with the sheep and
[21:36] flee it. And the wolf catched them and
[21:38] scattered the sheep. The hiling fleth
[21:41] because he is an hiling and carth not
[21:43] for the sheep.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; I am the good shepherd and I know and
[21:48] know my sheep and am known of mine.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; As the father knoweth me, even so know I
[21:55] the father and I lay down my life for
[21:57] the sheep. And another and other sheep I
[22:00] have which are not of this fold. Them
[22:03] also I must bring and they shall hear my
[22:05] voice. And there shall be one fold and
[22:09] one shepherd.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; So wisdom always takes you away from
[22:15] God.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; But faith makes you rest solemnly on
[22:19] God's word
[22:21] &gt;&gt; without wavering from it.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; He said Jesus said, "If you love me,
[22:24] you'll keep my words."
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; But wisdom looks at circumstances.
[22:32] They will try and and put their own
[22:33] interpretation and try to understand
[22:36] things. They want to want a scientific
[22:38] explanation of things.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Because you are living in an age where
[22:42] people are thought from university level
[22:44] now that you must have critical thinking
[22:46] to to to question everything.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[22:52] Now we wasn't there in the days of
[22:54] Jesus. We wasn't there in the days of
[22:56] Bible. Now they want to for for them now
[23:00] the the modern thinkers now they call
[23:02] modern thinkers critical thinkers they
[23:04] they criticize everything they want to
[23:06] question everything they want an
[23:08] explanation for everything.
[23:10] Now the thing of God must be believed by
[23:12] faith.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; But what makes you believe it? It's
[23:19] something on the inside. Amen. Yes,
[23:21] &gt;&gt; there must be a represent rep
[23:23] representation on the inside
[23:25] &gt;&gt; to amen that word. Something on the
[23:27] inside must amen that word.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Something on the inside must agree with
[23:31] it.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Something that you was always part of.
[23:34] Amen.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Because it's coded in your DNA. Amen.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; So you find that those that come into
[23:43] this world, those that cannot believe
[23:44] what we believe, those that want to
[23:46] leave is because they're leaning on
[23:48] wisdom. M
[23:50] &gt;&gt; but faith anchors in revelation. Amen.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Not reasoning.
[23:55] Because why? It's a supernatural message
[23:58] for a supernatural people.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; A mighty angel descended with an open
[24:02] book. Amen. We had God's visitation in
[24:06] our day.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; And not only was it a once visitation,
[24:12] God is ever present amongst us.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now manifesting through us.
[24:18] Because why? It's coming now to a needle
[24:21] point.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; And in the needle point,
[24:27] you see, you can hide things in seed
[24:29] form. You plant something on the ground,
[24:32] you can hide things in seed form, but
[24:34] what you can't hide is something in the
[24:36] harvest time.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; When it has to bear for fruit, whatever
[24:40] seed was in the ground must bring forth
[24:43] of its kind.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. So whatever seed was
[24:46] planted in the ground must bring the
[24:48] fruit of whatever seed it was.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Now you can't hide the fruit in fruit
[24:52] bearing time. Whatever fruit was there
[24:55] must show forth.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; It must show what it is.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; It could have been all the years. It
[25:00] could have had good fellowship all
[25:02] years. But in fruit form now you begin
[25:06] to see. Amen. So this is the needle
[25:10] point time where there will be a great
[25:13] falling away of those that are not part
[25:15] of
[25:16] &gt;&gt; God's program.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Those that are not part of the body of
[25:20] Christ
[25:22] because we are interested in the body of
[25:25] Christ.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; We are ambassadors of a kingdom.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; We are representing a kingdom upon the
[25:32] earth.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; A kingdom not made with hands.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; A supernatural kingdom. an eternal
[25:38] kingdom and we're part of that body of
[25:41] Christ, the mystical body of Christ and
[25:43] those that are not part of the body will
[25:45] fall out
[25:47] &gt;&gt; that those that don't have a part to
[25:48] play in the body will fall out. Amen.
[25:51] But those that are part of the body must
[25:54] be connected to the head
[25:56] &gt;&gt; must be in oneness with the head.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; And that's why you are now have his
[26:02] mind. You have his understanding of the
[26:04] word and you know what he once done with
[26:06] the word. Yeah,
[26:08] &gt;&gt; that was a spo that was spoken of us in
[26:11] this hour. Amen.
[26:13] Which is that one? That one with the
[26:15] rainbow of his head, the mighty angel.
[26:17] Amen.
[26:19] Come down to us a people. Amen.
[26:24] So what they trying to do with wisdom
[26:26] now? They're trying to
[26:29] what does critics will do? They will
[26:31] dissect every quotation.
[26:35] They will dissect scriptures by what?
[26:38] Science and history. And they will
[26:40] present their arguments.
[26:43] But their arguments are so weak because
[26:45] they don't tie up with scripture. They
[26:48] cannot take you from Genesis all the way
[26:50] to Revelation.
[26:53] They think they have understanding by
[26:56] criticizing scripture and making weak
[26:58] arguments. But to present your
[27:00] arguments, you must have proper
[27:01] authority.
[27:03] And you cannot go present an argument by
[27:05] hearsay evidence.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; If you was not present present at a
[27:11] particular event,
[27:13] &gt;&gt; you cannot be a witness to that to that
[27:15] event.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; But if if I come and tell you of that
[27:18] event and I was there, what I've already
[27:21] what what I told you and what you are
[27:22] now presenting is hearsay evidence.
[27:26] Is it not? There's no authority behind
[27:28] it. But if you was present there, then
[27:30] that's a different situation. if you
[27:32] witness it yourself.
[27:36] But that's what people are trying to do.
[27:37] Make weak arguments because why? They
[27:40] want to create doubt. That's what
[27:42] happened in the garden of Eden.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; We are dealing with spirits.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Speirs
[27:48] [Music]
[27:49] don't die.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Satan came to Eve in the Garden of Eden.
[27:56] Eve was presenting the word,
[27:58] &gt;&gt; what she knew of the word, and she gave
[28:00] the exact word. But he just created a
[28:02] doubt. He just changed it. Not He just
[28:04] changed it to one part of the word.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Eve should have said, "But you was not
[28:11] there.
[28:12] Adam was there when God gave the
[28:15] command.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; I was there."
[28:17] &gt;&gt; You know, Adam was Adam told me this,
[28:19] but you was not there.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; That should have been an argument.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; But she took doubt. She took reasoning.
[28:27] Amen.
[28:29] And you find this intellectual people
[28:31] you know when I was studying in
[28:33] university and I thought you know I want
[28:36] to be a good scholar and I will study
[28:39] this theory so nicely I'll study this
[28:41] statutory law and all so nicely and I
[28:44] will try and achieve distinctions and
[28:46] all that was very well but when I
[28:48] started practicing
[28:51] I realized all this theory and all
[28:54] is like nothing like I knew nothing
[28:56] because in reality When you practice
[28:58] something, it's totally different.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; It's like another world out there.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; A lot of people want to give you
[29:04] intellectual concept and bring theology
[29:06] in this message. They studied this
[29:08] message so well
[29:09] &gt;&gt; in theology.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; But ask them to go out there, pray for
[29:13] the sick. Ask them now to go and
[29:15] manifest this word, become a
[29:17] manifestation of this word.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; They cannot practice it.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Because why? There's something else have
[29:23] to kick in. It's either you're in it.
[29:24] It's either you are four in four, you're
[29:26] cut out for it or you're not cut out for
[29:27] it.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; So theory and practice are totally
[29:32] different things.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Now we're not believing a message on
[29:38] theory. Amen.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; We are believing a message that becomes
[29:41] practical to us.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; In every aspect of our life, this
[29:46] message is a living words.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of lays locked up
[29:50] in his words.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[29:53] But so why we we we ask ourself but why
[29:57] are people leaving the supernatural
[29:59] message?
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Sure
[30:00] &gt;&gt; because it's suddenly vindicated.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:9 2:19 says they went out from
[30:09] us but they were not of us.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; For if they had been of us they would
[30:16] not they would no doubt have continued
[30:19] with us.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. But they went out
[30:23] &gt;&gt; that they might be manifest that they
[30:26] would not they were not all of us.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; They were amongst us when the word was
[30:34] coming down. Amen.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; When the word was being poured out, when
[30:36] the food was falling out. Amen. But they
[30:40] could not mix the word with faith. Amen.
[30:43] But yay have an uncction from the holy
[30:46] one.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; And you know all things.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. A separating time
[30:53] &gt;&gt; is to God is doing the separation.
[30:57] Those that were predestinated
[30:59] will remain. Amen. And those who are not
[31:02] predestinated as part of the body will
[31:04] have to fall away.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Nothing to do with us. Amen. It is
[31:09] divine choosing. Amen.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; That's why we find that when the prophet
[31:15] say the shak to pull away
[31:17] &gt;&gt; for the wheat to be seed.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. for for now for this bride now for
[31:23] this body of Christ to rise up
[31:25] displaying Christ upon the earth
[31:27] everything that is not of Christ must be
[31:29] pulled away.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that is not completely
[31:34] in him that is not part of him that has
[31:37] not come to a complete union with him
[31:39] that has not received the message. What
[31:42] is the mighty angel coming down for?
[31:43] That is the message.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; It's coming down with a message.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; You have not received the shouts. You
[31:49] have not received a message.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; You have not come into a union.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; And if you have not received that, that
[31:58] is why they are being pulled away
[32:01] because there must be a display. Why
[32:03] does the shark have to be pulled away?
[32:05] For the wheat to be seen. So they have
[32:07] to be pulled away. So Christ must be
[32:09] seen again.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. There must be an end sign in his
[32:14] end time. Amen.
[32:16] Every son and daughter of God who was in
[32:18] his thoughts before the foundation of
[32:20] the world, if you were predestinated,
[32:22] there's nothing can take you away.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; If you're not, you will eventually go.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; You might stay along. You might help
[32:30] along, paying tithe, being a church
[32:33] member, being a part of a people that
[32:36] will be part of the flock. But if you're
[32:38] not, you're going to eventually go.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Because the tightening time. Amen.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; It's a tightening time.
[32:48] The true seed of God cannot be deceived.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Because she's anchored in revelation.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. She gets stimulated by the word.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Every time she receives revelation, it
[33:03] stimulates her.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It revives her.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Because you are eating from an open
[33:10] book. You're eating fresh mana all the
[33:12] time.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. This manner cannot be stilled
[33:15] because this man is in the shikina
[33:17] glory.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not just in the hard
[33:21] courts now. You are not just there in
[33:22] the wilderness receiving manner.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; You are in the most holy place.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are now receiving in a private
[33:30] place.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a private affair. Amen.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; There is an intimate relationship
[33:35] between you and Christ.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; And you are partaking from the from the
[33:40] manner that cannot be still. Oh yes,
[33:43] &gt;&gt; it's packed with good. Amen.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; And it's got as you partake of it, it's
[33:47] a supernatural word.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, this people body one of these days
[33:51] is going to change
[33:52] &gt;&gt; from corruption to incorruption. Amen.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; This mortal must put on immortality.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; You'll be able to change dimensions,
[34:00] leap over walls.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There'll be a time when
[34:04] you'll be able to leap over walls.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; That is changing dimensions. Amen.
[34:10] Oh, what a time.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; So, we anchored in revelation. Amen.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; We know we're living in an hour where
[34:20] wisdom stumbles. It must stumble.
[34:23] Man-made wisdom must stumble, but faith
[34:25] will always prevail. Amen.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Read some quotes. The prophet of God
[34:32] says
[34:35] the message wisdom versus faith. says
[34:38] but there's only two sources that we can
[34:40] draw our life from and one of them is
[34:43] wisdom and the other is faith and if we
[34:46] think that wisdom produces
[34:49] and then what faith produces
[34:53] there is a wisdom of God
[34:56] is stay with his word but Satan in his
[35:01] wisdom try to twist the word so that's
[35:04] the wisdom I'm speaking of there a
[35:07] certain amount of faith that goes with
[35:09] Satan.
[35:11] In order to accept Satan, you got to
[35:13] believe Satan.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; So there is a perverted faith to a
[35:17] perverted thing. And anything that would
[35:19] try to twist the word of God to make it
[35:22] say something that it doesn't
[35:24] &gt;&gt; is the wrong spirit.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Offering wisdom against God's word. So
[35:31] we're going to refer to it as wisdom and
[35:34] not Satan's faith.
[35:36] Many of those people that believe that
[35:38] are sincere and believe just with all
[35:41] the faith that they got that they're
[35:44] right. You have to watch. The blanket
[35:47] stretches two ways down. The only way to
[35:50] be sure is come back to the original
[35:52] word. There is where everything is based
[35:56] on the word. Now we find that these two
[35:59] factions or sources is one wisdom and
[36:03] the other one faith and they verse one
[36:06] another since creation in the garden of
[36:08] Eden. Now there is children on both
[36:11] sides
[36:16] the wisdom we're talking about something
[36:18] that will not agree that all the word is
[36:22] the truth. Some will say you know those
[36:26] things are only for the prophet's time.
[36:28] These things like how the Baptist used
[36:31] to say the Holy Ghost stopped with the
[36:33] apostles.
[36:35] Mark 16 is not for our time. All
[36:37] scripture is given for inspiration.
[36:39] Amen. We take all of the word. Amen.
[36:44] And if wisdom of that sort come from
[36:47] Satan, his children live by that wisdom.
[36:50] And if the faith of God come to God and
[36:54] God is word, God children live on faith.
[36:57] The Bible said they just live by wisdom.
[37:00] Faith they just live sorry they just
[37:02] live by faith. Not what he can learn but
[37:05] what he can believe.
[37:08] Something that's revealed to you. Amen.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Now
[37:15] what is the wisdom that we're talking
[37:16] about? Something that will not
[37:18] Sorry.
[37:25] It says now in the 10th chapter of the
[37:28] book of revelation of Jesus Christ I
[37:30] wish to read the first few verse 1-7.
[37:34] He said, "I saw another mighty angel,
[37:36] another mighty angel come down from
[37:38] heaven clothed with a cloud, and a
[37:39] rainbow was upon his head, and his face
[37:41] were the sun, and his feet as pillars of
[37:43] fire. And he had in his hand a little
[37:45] book open. And he set his right foot on
[37:48] the sea, and his left foot on the earth,
[37:49] and cried with a loud voice, as when a
[37:52] lion roared. And when he cried, seven
[37:54] thunders uttered their voices." And when
[37:57] the seven thunders had uttered their
[37:58] voices, I was about to write, and I
[38:00] heard a voice from heaven, saying unto
[38:01] me, "Seal up those things which the
[38:04] seven thunders uttered, and write them
[38:05] not." And the angel which I saw standing
[38:08] upon the sea and upon the earth lifted
[38:10] up his hands to heaven and swear by him
[38:12] that liveth forever and ever created
[38:13] heavens. And the things that
[38:16] the thing that in them are and the earth
[38:18] and the things that therein are and the
[38:20] sea and the things therein are that
[38:23] there should be time no longer. But in
[38:25] the days of the voice of the seven angel
[38:28] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[38:30] of God should be finished as he declared
[38:32] to his servants the prophets. Now the
[38:35] reason why I read the scripture again
[38:36] I'll tell you why it's in the quote
[38:39] and he says and my text if I should call
[38:42] it tonight is this is this the sign of
[38:45] the end sir now this is a year before
[38:49] the actual event takes place
[38:52] now
[38:55] he says and we all know that we are
[38:57] living in a glorious time for the church
[38:59] but a horrible time for the unbeliever
[39:01] and we living in one of the most
[39:03] dangerous times of All all that ever was
[39:06] since the world began begun. No prophet,
[39:09] no apostle never in no time ever lived
[39:12] in such a time as we live now. This is
[39:14] the end. It's written in the skies,
[39:16] written all over the face of the earth.
[39:18] It's written in every newspaper. This is
[39:20] the end.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; If you can read the handwriting, the
[39:23] prophets lived in the time. When the
[39:25] handwriting was on the wall for a
[39:27] nation, but we living when the
[39:29] handwriting is on the wall for for time,
[39:33] &gt;&gt; all nations, earth, everything, time is
[39:36] at the end. So we must search the
[39:38] scriptures to find the hour that we are
[39:40] living. So he says here now always a
[39:43] true prophet of God will go to the
[39:45] scriptures.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Therefore is absolute that it's going to
[39:51] be that way. In the old testaments when
[39:54] the prophet said anything they always
[39:56] some somewhere was a prophet with the
[39:58] word who stayed with the word. He
[40:00] watched God for the vision and if his
[40:03] vision was contrary to the word then his
[40:05] vision was wrong. That's God way of
[40:07] getting his word to his people. So he's
[40:10] preaching it in 1962 is just the sign of
[40:14] the answer but he's going to a scripture
[40:17] that's going to take place according to
[40:19] his vision.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. because he sees a vision and he's
[40:23] going to a scripture and in a vision and
[40:27] the scripture now he's thoroughly
[40:28] vindicated the following year
[40:31] and yet people can be stumbled upon
[40:33] that. How do you explain a man with a
[40:37] seventh grade education going to go now
[40:39] into scripture and because he's
[40:42] interpreting his vision through
[40:43] scripture
[40:44] and he's showing you it's this is now
[40:47] remember I told you somebody's
[40:48] presenting a case they must have
[40:50] evidence this is documented evidence
[40:53] &gt;&gt; amen
[40:53] &gt;&gt; it's there in recordings
[40:56] &gt;&gt; he's making the statements a year before
[41:00] &gt;&gt; so it's evident if you were to present
[41:02] as evidence it's authentic evidence.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; And he's telling you of the event of his
[41:09] vision
[41:10] &gt;&gt; and he's going to describe what the
[41:11] thing that's going to happen. But he's
[41:13] going to the scripture.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Because what he said, what the Bible
[41:17] says, what what did Paul say? Even if
[41:19] the angel from heaven come and preach
[41:21] any other gospel than what I preach, let
[41:23] him be accursed.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; So it always must go back to the word.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:29] And another scripture says, "Let every
[41:31] word, man's word, be a lie, but my word
[41:33] be the truth."
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth will pass away, but my
[41:36] word will still remain. You can't add to
[41:38] the word, you can't take out from the
[41:39] word. So being a prophet, a scriptural
[41:42] prophet, it goes to the scripture,
[41:45] &gt;&gt; but it's recorded
[41:47] and witnesses.
[41:50] But now people who wasn't even there
[41:52] want to present a weak argument
[41:54] &gt;&gt; and dispute a mighty angel coming down.
[41:57] And he went that event is just now just
[42:00] fulfilling this. This was already spoken
[42:03] of before it happened. It it God didn't
[42:06] even have to show it, didn't he? And who
[42:08] took the picture? Science took the
[42:10] picture.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; The prophet didn't go take a camera,
[42:14] take a picture, and then show the
[42:15] people. Science took the picture and
[42:18] showed it there.
[42:19] So it's stubbornly vindicated. Evidence
[42:22] is glaring in the face. The reason why
[42:25] the evidence was there because on the
[42:27] day of judgment the scripture, the
[42:29] vision
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; and the evidence is going to be
[42:32] displayed all over there.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; There's going to be evidence beyond a
[42:37] reasonable of doubt
[42:41] there. Now what the people are going to
[42:42] do there before the judgment seat,
[42:46] but thank God we wasn't there. But we
[42:49] see it through the word.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Because we are part of him.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We bypassed our word part.
[42:57] Amen. But now we going back to the word.
[43:00] We are driven back to the word. Amen.
[43:02] All of the word. We are driven back to
[43:04] it. We are being influenced by the word.
[43:06] Amen.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; We're not being influenced by wisdom of
[43:10] man. We being influenced by the words.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; The revealed word for our day.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; We are being influenced by the
[43:17] supernatural word that was given to us.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we've been influenced by
[43:22] us, we are no longer conforming any
[43:24] longer to the pattern of this world.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Because another word has been revealed
[43:29] to us.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; We are now being transformed by the
[43:33] renewing of our minds.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Because this word is renewing our mind.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; It's showing us where we originally come
[43:40] from.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; It's showing us what our purpose is
[43:43] intended on the earth for.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; It's showing us what our life ought to
[43:46] be like. Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. in showing out our finished
[43:49] completed condition.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; That we are sinless, spotless, bright,
[43:54] without blemish. Amen.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yes,
[43:57] &gt;&gt; that we are sons and daughters of the
[43:59] most high God coming to perfection in
[44:01] this hour. Amen.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; And you know that is the purpose behind
[44:05] you coming to perfection. What is the
[44:07] purpose of you coming to perfection?
[44:09] They without us cannot be made perfect.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. There's people out there in the
[44:14] sixth dimension that that that needs to
[44:16] be emptied out from there. But they're
[44:18] waiting upon us to come to perfection.
[44:20] Amen.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; All nature is groaning and travailing
[44:23] for sons of daughters of God to come
[44:26] into perfection in this hour.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It says not by power, not by
[44:34] might, but not by the wisdom of Egypt,
[44:37] not by the wisdom of our schools, not by
[44:39] the power of our seminaries, but not by
[44:42] the amount of our organization, not by
[44:45] the power of our scholarly teachings,
[44:47] but by my spirit say God. His wisdom was
[44:51] vanished and it end when he met God in
[44:53] the burning bush there. talking about
[44:55] Moses now. He took off his shoes and
[44:57] humbled himself to humility and forgot
[45:00] all about his wisdom.
[45:02] God bringing deliverance and to train
[45:04] him in wisdom to let him fall to show
[45:07] that you cannot lean upon the arm of
[45:09] your own understanding or anybody else's
[45:12] understanding. Let him fall to show his
[45:15] hand. Can you see it? God's purpose in
[45:17] doing so was to display himself in
[45:20] humility. And he let Moses become the
[45:23] highest until he would be the next
[45:26] Pharaoh. He was a mighty general
[45:28] according to history. He conquered.
[45:30] Moses himself conquered the countries
[45:32] around. And then when he turned to the
[45:34] work of the Lord with all of his talent,
[45:37] God let him take a headlong topple so
[45:39] that he could put him out there on the
[45:42] desert and beat him all that of him.
[45:45] beat all that out of him and then appear
[45:47] to him in humility
[45:49] &gt;&gt; and send him down with a stick in his
[45:51] hand to deliver the people.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Same with us. God had to take us out of
[45:58] from every system, from every
[45:59] organization, from all the things that
[46:01] we ever believed in.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We had to come to humility. We had
[46:06] to face persecution to believe this
[46:08] message
[46:09] &gt;&gt; to believe his word. I mean, you're
[46:11] telling people that you believe a
[46:13] message that God sent you a a prophet
[46:15] with a word and this prophet is now not
[46:18] living upon the earth.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; And you're believing this.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; In a time where times are moving.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Where things have become modern,
[46:28] everyone is upgrading, but you are
[46:30] believing this oldfashioned gospel from
[46:32] the Bible.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Tell them, "Yes, we believe this
[46:36] oldfashioned gospel because the same old
[46:38] fashioned gospel can still do the
[46:40] supernatural." Amen.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; And even more now, because the Bible
[46:43] said, "Greater works than these shall
[46:46] do." Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; What was done in the days of Jesus, what
[46:49] you saw there, what you read about
[46:50] there, greater works than these are
[46:53] expected upon the earth. Because before
[46:55] we leave the earth, there must be a
[46:56] mighty move of God upon the earth. Right
[46:58] now, all over the world, there's a
[47:00] mighty move of God amongst his body.
[47:02] Amen. Right now, people are getting
[47:04] stirred up. People coming to recognize
[47:07] the hour and the the day that they
[47:08] they're living in right now. They're
[47:10] coming to come in the it is the Holy
[47:12] Ghost working to the five ministry that
[47:15] is positionally placing the people
[47:18] &gt;&gt; into their inheritance.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't maybe all the years you
[47:23] was told what your inheritance is, but
[47:25] now you are being placed into your
[47:27] inheritance. Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; And you are good enough now to go and
[47:30] enjoy your inheritance to have the
[47:32] benefits of it. Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; He says there's one named Paul
[47:41] that was a smart man and he said he had
[47:43] to forget everything he knowed in order
[47:45] to know Christ.
[47:47] He said I never come to you with
[47:49] enticing words. The wisdom of men but I
[47:51] come to you in the power of the
[47:53] resurrection of Christ.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; See Paul did not come with fancy words.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; He did not come with fancy quotations.
[48:00] Yeah,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; he did not come and show you fancy
[48:03] things but when he spoke you felt the
[48:05] anointing of God through his ministry.
[48:07] That is why when a son and daughter
[48:09] anointed servant of God comes when a son
[48:11] and daughter of God speak when you speak
[48:13] the people are conf the people are now
[48:15] looking at you in amazement they're
[48:17] wondering why are you speaking the
[48:18] supernatural things they're wondering
[48:20] why are you talking like that because
[48:22] they don't hear these things the little
[48:24] nuggets that you're sharing with people
[48:26] through the week your families your
[48:27] friends the people that you come across
[48:29] they never heard things like that
[48:31] &gt;&gt; because it's a time of spiritual famine
[48:34] &gt;&gt; because why you speaking you're speaking
[48:36] with an anointing ing. Amen.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; You'll find that people that you find
[48:40] that maybe the life was so wrecked up,
[48:43] they're going to come to you because
[48:45] why? They know that when you speak, the
[48:47] little words that you say will bring
[48:49] conviction upon them.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; I remember the time when I first started
[48:52] preaching and I went out preaching in
[48:55] the in the out there to to people that
[48:58] were homeless and I was preaching out
[49:00] there in the streets and I was preaching
[49:02] one day. I was preaching and then I see
[49:04] people crying. I never saw I what I what
[49:07] I was shocked because now I'm just I'm
[49:09] just thinking I'm breaching but I didn't
[49:11] realize what the power of God can do.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; How you can bring conviction to people
[49:16] one guy comes up to me one day said I
[49:18] used to be a doctor and this is how my
[49:20] life ended up in divorce and so forth
[49:22] and my life got ended up in drugs and
[49:24] this is how I ended up in this condition
[49:26] and the man was in tears but your normal
[49:28] speaking can't do that.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; It takes the power of God to convict
[49:32] somebody.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't need enticing words.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that is in you.
[49:39] Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; What will attract people to you? It's
[49:42] the Holy Ghost in you.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; But people want to be a smart alec. They
[49:49] want to be an intellectual.
[49:51] They want to have the right words. They
[49:54] want to have the right eloquence. They
[49:57] want to pronounce their words properly
[49:59] instead of having a personal
[50:00] relationship with God. Having a back of
[50:02] the desert experience. Amen. When you
[50:05] have the back of the desert experience,
[50:07] when you are here, the supernatural must
[50:09] take place.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lives can be transformed. What is
[50:13] the greater? What is the greatest thing
[50:15] that can take place? When you find that
[50:17] somebody that nobody even considered
[50:19] them that their lives can be
[50:20] transformed.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; That they can come and believe the
[50:23] message of the hour.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. They can come and believe the
[50:26] things that you believe in.
[50:29] Amen. When is the time when we be able
[50:31] to speak to people and people say,
[50:32] "Brother,
[50:34] I need a change in my life."
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; What you told me is true. The hour is
[50:38] late. I need to take me there. I need to
[50:40] be baptized.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Or brother, I haven't received the Holy
[50:43] Ghost. I need the Holy Ghost. Brother, I
[50:46] need I have been messing around. I've
[50:49] just coming and and and finding myself
[50:51] comfort and safety and security because
[50:54] I believe a message. But I haven't
[50:56] really had a close walk with God.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; I haven't had a personal walk with God.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; I haven't felt a personal touch from
[51:03] God.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Because you've been disconnected from
[51:06] God.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Because you thought you got safety and
[51:09] security in the message because you come
[51:12] by wisdom.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; You need to come by faith. Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without faith, it is impossible to
[51:18] please God.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; So, we know we are part
[51:27] of the mystery of God. Amen. We know we
[51:30] can't be deceived.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Because we are part of him.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 10:39 says, "But we are
[51:39] not of them who draw back unto petition,
[51:44] but of them that believe to the saving
[51:47] of the soul."
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't draw back to petition.
[51:51] Amen.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; This is a serious hour. You're going to
[52:06] find that
[52:08] many people that profess to believe this
[52:11] message. Many people that came with good
[52:14] and profess to be ambassadors of this
[52:18] message should I say
[52:20] are going to be shaken in this hour
[52:24] because why? It is not them that being
[52:25] shak shaking themselves. No, it's the
[52:28] angel of God that's shaking them out and
[52:31] sifting them out because why? Wrong
[52:34] fruit. If they were right, it's only the
[52:36] fruit that started off right. But the
[52:38] seed, if the seed was right, that fruit
[52:40] must remain. Every other fruit that is
[52:42] not of him that they don't bear for
[52:45] Christ must be plucked out.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Every other fruit that doesn't bear the
[52:50] life of Christ, what is Christ? Christ
[52:52] is the word.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Believe all of his word.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Believe the word because now we're not
[52:57] talking about a word of another day.
[52:59] Believe the word that is now.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The word that is being ministered
[53:03] unto you now, the present word, fresh
[53:06] manner. Amen.
[53:09] If you are not bearing forth the fruits
[53:13] and being fruitful, they will be plucked
[53:15] out. Amen. Wisdom versus faith. Amen.
[53:21] And you cannot use man-made wisdom to
[53:25] interpret a supernatural message that
[53:27] comes from a supernatural God
[53:30] &gt;&gt; to a supernatural people. Amen. We might
[53:33] be trapped in the pest house, but we
[53:35] supernatural beings trapped in this
[53:37] flesh body.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you're becoming
[53:40] uncomfortable. You're becoming restless
[53:42] in his body because you're a
[53:44] supernatural being.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; You're desiring a better body.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; But you already know what the body is
[53:49] like. Amen.
[53:50] You already tasted of that body. Amen.
[53:53] Because that that is what you're feeding
[53:54] on right now.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; You are feeding on the body word. Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; The unfailing body word of the son of
[54:02] man. And you know what it's like to have
[54:05] a new body. Amen. And you are feeding on
[54:09] this word that's going to translate this
[54:10] body that's going to make you change
[54:12] dimensions.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; That is why when you go to your doctor,
[54:15] your doctor tell you you got this, you
[54:17] got that. You say right doctor that is
[54:20] your reason that is your scientific
[54:22] knowledge your scientific interpretation
[54:24] &gt;&gt; but I know you're talking about spirits
[54:28] &gt;&gt; and I have rightful claims over my body
[54:30] doctor.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Oh yes
[54:33] &gt;&gt; and I know the mighty conqueror has
[54:35] already conquered death and and the
[54:37] grave.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. By his stripes we were healed.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; It is a finished work.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. And I have rightful claims to go
[54:47] now and claim my healing
[54:52] &gt;&gt; that I have need of.
[54:54] So doctor, according to your science,
[54:56] there's a limit to your knowledge
[54:58] because you're learning from a finite
[55:00] mind
[55:01] &gt;&gt; and your knowledge is limited
[55:04] and knowledge is always being upgraded.
[55:07] What you hear learned 40 years ago or 20
[55:11] 100 years ago was different. Medical
[55:13] science is improving all the time.
[55:16] But I can tell you something that
[55:17] spirits don't die.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; And I now know what I'm dealing with.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; But I know the one that conquered dead
[55:25] Ellen's brave. He's our only imps. He's
[55:28] our only spirits.
[55:30] And now you know what to deal with. The
[55:32] doctor say, "God, I know that's only a
[55:33] name of a spirit.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Let me now go and rebuke that name.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Let me now give you eviction orders
[55:40] &gt;&gt; because why? The one who have rightful
[55:42] claims over me is Christ Jesus.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; He died for me. He purchased me.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Only he can claim. These are squatters.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going to remove the squatters now.
[55:54] I'm going to give them eviction notice.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to use South African law
[55:58] because South African law is too lenient
[56:00] on squatters.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. The enforcer of the
[56:03] claim is here. The mighty angel is here
[56:05] amongst us.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to use God's laws. I'm
[56:09] going to evict you because said whatever
[56:11] you bind on heaven shall be bound on
[56:12] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Whatever you loose on earth shall be
[56:16] loosed in heaven.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; So you evict that demon.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; From your family, from your loved ones,
[56:24] from your friends, whoever they call
[56:26] evict them. But the person whose body
[56:28] that is,
[56:28] &gt;&gt; it is them that must speak.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; That's why you find sometime prayers go
[56:32] un unanswered.
[56:35] Because the one where the demon is
[56:37] troubling that person, that person must
[56:38] be able to say, "I don't want you say
[56:41] &gt;&gt; I don't want this demon spirit on me."
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; It's same like when you're praying for a
[56:45] sinner, that sinner needs to come to
[56:47] repentance.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; That sinner needs to come forward.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you're going to preach them,
[56:52] preach them, bring conviction, but you
[56:54] are forcing them now to be saved. They
[56:56] don't want to be saved.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; They something must happen on the
[56:59] inside.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So just like when you're dealing
[57:03] with a demon spirit,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; they need to realize I'm a son and
[57:07] daughter of God.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Christ has rightful claims over me.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; No demon power has claims over me.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; No squattering demon has claims over my
[57:18] body.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; I rebuke you, Satan.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; You leave my body in the name of Jesus
[57:23] Christ.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; You've got to believe that. Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; You can take wisdom.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; You can take the doctor's reasoning. You
[57:30] can reason it or you can take faith.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; You can trust God's word. Amen.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with taking going going to
[57:39] the doctor. Nothing wrong to take
[57:40] medication, but I take it by faith.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Take it knowing that when I take
[57:45] it, Lord, I'm taking this medication.
[57:47] You have allowed signs to come this far.
[57:48] They went into your laboratory and they
[57:51] they were they now realize they can make
[57:52] this medicine. They can help people. But
[57:54] I'm taking by faith knowing that you've
[57:56] already died for my sins.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; It's a finished work.
[58:00] Amen.
[58:02] All things are possible with God. The
[58:04] other day I went and I met I'll show you
[58:08] my my family the picture of a policeman
[58:12] that I prayed for in 2004 or 2005 either
[58:16] that time right now it's 2025
[58:19] and he was diagnosed with HIV and he was
[58:22] going to die
[58:25] and
[58:27] he went and I I said to him something in
[58:29] me said I want to pray for you
[58:31] &gt;&gt; and then something in in me. I didn't
[58:34] didn't make it to pray for him on that
[58:36] day. Then he got so sick that he went to
[58:39] the farm to die.
[58:41] Then I just went I felt a little
[58:43] despondent because I didn't get the
[58:44] opportunity to go and pray for him. Yet
[58:46] I know I felt the conviction to pray for
[58:47] him. Something in me tugging me to pray
[58:50] for him. So I prayed him. I studied and
[58:53] I prayed for him sincerely. I said,
[58:55] "Lord, all I want you to do is heal him
[58:58] just enough to come to light duties."
[59:02] I never asked the Lord to heal him. I
[59:03] said, "Heal him just enough." I was
[59:05] specific. I said, "Heal him just enough
[59:07] to come to light duties to work so that
[59:10] I can see him and pray for him."
[59:13] About a week later or two weeks later, I
[59:17] see him there coming to work in the
[59:19] office in plain clothes and light, but
[59:22] very like, you know, you can see debt on
[59:25] his face.
[59:27] I said to him, "You are not here by
[59:30] chance. you are here by the but it's a
[59:32] miracle that you are
[59:33] &gt;&gt; yes
[59:33] &gt;&gt; he said you'll never believe I was there
[59:35] in the farm to die and I thought it's
[59:37] light
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I said red come with me now just go I
[59:40] took him to the helipad
[59:43] &gt;&gt; I took him to the helipad I said right I
[59:45] want you to confess all your sins
[59:47] &gt;&gt; confess all your past sins confess
[59:49] everything
[59:50] &gt;&gt; amen
[59:50] &gt;&gt; and I said right now we're going to pray
[59:52] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:54] &gt;&gt; amen
[59:54] &gt;&gt; and we prayed a prayer of faith
[59:57] &gt;&gt; wasn't a wasn't screaming wasn't
[59:59] honoring just a simple prayer of faith
[1:00:02] and immediately when I prayed his whole
[1:00:04] countenance I saw a change within two
[1:00:06] weeks later he was back in uniform now
[1:00:08] it's 2025 I met him again and he was
[1:00:10] still giving the testimony in the south
[1:00:12] where he's working now in the south
[1:00:13] south region at his police station I met
[1:00:15] him there I took a picture with him and
[1:00:17] he was telling uh the people there how I
[1:00:20] prayed for him and what happened what
[1:00:22] God did for him
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; so we serve a miracle working God
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; this is a supernatural God who is the
[1:00:29] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; If he heal one person then, he can heal
[1:00:34] them today. Nothing is impossible.
[1:00:36] There's no such thing as an incurable
[1:00:37] disease with God.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; All things are possible with him.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; To them that believe his sign shall
[1:00:43] follow.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet. Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; That you've been blessed.
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Glorify your name.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that song. I love him.
[1:01:06] Amen. You love him tonight.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Grateful for all he's done for us. Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sure.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; What an awesome God we serve.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even before we ask him, he knows
[1:01:17] the thing that we have needed.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "Ask and you shall receive.
[1:01:22] Knock and it shall be open. Seek and you
[1:01:23] shall find."
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] Oh,
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:33] I
[1:01:36] love him.
[1:01:40] I

[1:03:25] to Jesus.
[1:03:29] In moment

[1:03:40] my hands.

[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; I've heard what you have to say, Lord.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:04:44] it's a Lord. It's a late hour
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; and I don't want to Lord waste the the
[1:04:49] precious time that you placed me upon
[1:04:51] the earth for Lord.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; I want to Lord be part of your program.
[1:04:56] Oh God.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe Lord I've been stuck in man's
[1:04:59] program.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; What I mean by man's program is stuck in
[1:05:03] my career. Stuck in the things that I
[1:05:05] have to do for my family. Stuck in the
[1:05:08] things that I have to do to achieve
[1:05:09] things in this life.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I want to be part of your
[1:05:12] program.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. For you placed me on the earth
[1:05:15] for a purpose.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; You have predestinated my life for a
[1:05:19] purpose to serve you, to serve you
[1:05:22] wholeheartedly, Lord.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; tonight. If you want to make that
[1:05:27] surrender to God, I want to do that.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Be my God.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I want to surrender myself
[1:05:31] completely.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; I want to submit myself completely unto
[1:05:34] you, Lord.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, you placed me here for a purpose,
[1:05:37] Lord, God. And I want to serve you
[1:05:39] wholeheartedly, Lord,
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; with all of my life, with all of my
[1:05:42] strength, with all that's within me,
[1:05:44] Lord.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to serve you, Lord.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, I want to be in your
[1:05:50] program, oh God.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I know that Lord, this might
[1:05:54] be an hour, Lord, where we don't have
[1:05:56] much time. But Lord, whatever I can do
[1:05:58] for your kingdom, Lord, help me to do
[1:05:59] it, Lord.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh father, I want to be Lord. I
[1:06:03] rather I don't want to be a busy body
[1:06:05] upon the earth, but I rather be busy for
[1:06:07] your kingdom, oh Lord.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
