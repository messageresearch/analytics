[0:53] amen even as we see the day fast
[0:55] approaching amen so hallelujah you'll
[0:58] love the lord this morning
[1:00] amen this morning we'll speak on our
[1:01] groaning for immortality
[1:03] amen
[1:04] our groaning for immortality
[1:08] and we'll take our scripture reading
[1:10] from psalm chapter 13 and verse 1
[1:17] amen
[1:20] amen
[1:22] how long will thou forget me
[1:24] oh lord
[1:26] forever
[1:28] how long will thou i thy face from me
[1:31] how long shall i take counsel in my soul
[1:34] having sorrow in my heart daily
[1:36] how long shall my enemy be exalted over
[1:39] me
[1:40] consider and hear me o lord my god
[1:44] lighten my eyes lest i sleep the sleep
[1:46] of death
[1:48] let my enemies say i prevailed against
[1:50] him and those that trouble me
[1:53] rejoice
[1:54] when i am moved
[1:56] but i trusted in thy mercy
[1:58] my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation
[2:01] i will sing unto the lord because he had
[2:04] dealt bountifully with me
[2:07] amen so david's cry and he's grown is
[2:10] how long
[2:11] amen how long will thou forget me oh
[2:13] lord
[2:15] how long will you hide your face from me
[2:18] let's turn to romans 8 22
[2:21] amen
[2:25] it says for we know that the all
[2:27] creation
[2:29] groaneth
[2:30] and travail it in pain
[2:33] it's an anguish
[2:35] together until now
[2:40] amen
[2:42] and not
[2:43] only they but ourselves also which have
[2:46] the first fruits of the spirit
[2:49] that's ephesians 1 14
[2:51] the earnest of our inheritance
[2:55] we have the first fruit of the spirit
[2:57] even we
[2:58] ourselves grown within ourselves
[3:03] waiting for the adoption to
[3:05] the redemption of our body
[3:09] amen so we see creation is groaning and
[3:11] there's a groan in the redeemed
[3:14] there's a groan within each and every
[3:16] one of us
[3:17] if there's no groan there then something
[3:19] is wrong
[3:21] amen there's got to be a groaning
[3:23] within us
[3:24] we are waiting for the adoption towards
[3:28] the redemption of our body
[3:31] amen amen you may be seated
[3:36] amen
[3:38] so outgrown him for immortality
[3:42] amen we find that we are groaning
[3:45] everything around us is groaning
[3:47] because we realize and creation realizes
[3:51] that something is not right
[3:54] amen
[3:57] and the only way you can groan and wait
[3:59] for it is because we know that there is
[4:02] a new life that is coming
[4:04] and it speaks of a new world
[4:07] they are talking about a new world order
[4:10] but god is in the process of bringing
[4:12] his new world order
[4:15] where he is king of kings
[4:17] and he is lord of lords
[4:19] and all the presidents of the world and
[4:22] all the kings of the world will bow down
[4:25] at the name of jesus
[4:27] and worship him as king
[4:29] amen we know that the new life that is
[4:32] here and that is zoe life
[4:35] god's own life
[4:37] amen all nature is groaning for this day
[4:40] of sweet release
[4:43] amen death is as painful as it seems
[4:48] to the human that watching it but to the
[4:51] one that is happening too it's a day of
[4:53] sweet release
[4:55] because they step into a new body
[4:58] but that's only for the believer that is
[5:00] being born again
[5:02] not everyone that dies goes into a new
[5:04] body amen
[5:06] amen you must be born again
[5:09] you must accept the lord jesus as your
[5:12] personal savior so we find that nature
[5:15] is waiting for this glorious day until
[5:17] that day when christ shall come the
[5:20] second time from the heaven
[5:22] amen and we know that god would send him
[5:25] in due season matter of fact the descent
[5:27] has already started
[5:30] he has already started descending with a
[5:32] shout
[5:33] that's the message going forth the
[5:36] rapture is a process and the cycle of
[5:38] the rapture is already started
[5:41] amen amen so we can say we are in the
[5:44] process of the second coming
[5:46] and it will culminate it will end when
[5:49] the dead in christ rise and we are both
[5:52] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[5:53] of an eye
[5:55] but first amen we must be ready
[5:58] we are being prepared now
[6:01] the message has come to give us faith
[6:03] for this translation
[6:06] amen then jesus will go to that sixth
[6:09] dimension amen and they will be judged
[6:12] according to what their leaders taught
[6:14] them
[6:15] and if they are accepted then they will
[6:17] come back to the earth to pick up their
[6:21] mortal bodies amen amen that's what we
[6:24] believe amen that's what we are taught
[6:27] amen so the birds are waiting for that
[6:30] amen if you think about the birds sing
[6:33] sweetly wait till the day of full
[6:35] redemption comes you'll hear the birds
[6:37] sing a sweeter song
[6:39] amen the trees are waiting for that all
[6:42] nature is bending and weeping waiting
[6:46] for that time groaning to be closed upon
[6:49] amen
[6:51] amen we look at a tree
[6:55] a tree struggles for life
[6:58] they struggle to hold out their branches
[7:00] and to sing the glories of god
[7:03] amen
[7:04] it wants to live a tree doesn't want to
[7:06] die
[7:07] amen look at the flowers only struggle
[7:10] to live but just for the frost and the
[7:12] cold to tear them down
[7:16] notice an animal how it struggles in its
[7:19] death it struggles to live amen look at
[7:22] the birds look at the beast of the field
[7:25] the struggle for survival
[7:27] everything is groaning everything in
[7:29] nature is groaning all creation is
[7:32] groaning and every time you see this
[7:34] groan
[7:36] you know amen something they are
[7:37] groaning for something every time you
[7:39] see an earthquake
[7:41] the earth is groaning
[7:42] when you see the rivers flooding amen
[7:46] and over flooding the rivers are
[7:48] groaning when you see a tsunami the sea
[7:51] is groaning when you see a tornado the
[7:53] winds are groaning
[7:55] and we ourselves are groaning because we
[7:58] know that something is wrong
[8:00] something has been lost both to man and
[8:03] to the earth
[8:05] all creation has lost something
[8:08] because if you read genesis 1 when god
[8:11] created the heavens and the earth and he
[8:13] created man everything was perfect
[8:17] but something happened amen
[8:20] amen
[8:21] creation lost something
[8:24] and we see from the inspired word of god
[8:27] that it is groaning for some reason you
[8:29] don't groan unless there's a reason
[8:33] amen and we find as we grow older the
[8:36] groan becomes more natural
[8:40] amen
[8:41] there's an ape and there's a pain
[8:44] there's a groan
[8:47] amen you younger people that don't know
[8:49] what a groaning is when your parents
[8:51] switch off your wi-fi and take away your
[8:52] cell phone that's your groan
[8:57] [Music]
[8:59] you know because the young man doesn't
[9:00] know what old age is
[9:03] amen
[9:05] but that's
[9:07] for wrong of you it might be a bigger
[9:09] groan if you take away your cell phone
[9:11] you think the end of the world came
[9:14] amen but something is lost
[9:17] and it's groaning trying to get it back
[9:20] back to its original condition amen
[9:24] amen imagine somebody falling from the
[9:26] earth down to a deep pit somewhere and
[9:29] is struggling and climbing pulling to
[9:32] get out of the pit
[9:35] amen
[9:36] they must by some means get out of the
[9:38] pit
[9:40] i think brother sunny mentions that this
[9:41] is called a pulpit because we are trying
[9:43] to pull people out of the pit
[9:45] of hell
[9:47] amen
[9:48] they're not in the original stage
[9:50] they're frantically screaming because
[9:52] they're in the spit and they're trying
[9:54] to get out of this pit
[9:56] and many people that have turned down
[9:58] the gospel are down in the fifth
[10:00] dimension in hell being tormented trying
[10:03] to get out of that pit this morning amen
[10:07] you remember that when lazarus was taken
[10:10] over into the bosom of abraham
[10:13] and the rich young ruler was there on
[10:15] the other side of the chasm
[10:17] and he couldn't get out of there he was
[10:20] trying to get out of that pit
[10:22] he was trying to get some water
[10:25] amen today if you hear his voice
[10:28] except the lord jesus christ
[10:30] except his plan of salvation hallelujah
[10:33] amen why you still can have salvation
[10:38] amen so what are they doing they're
[10:40] clawing at the walls they say a drowning
[10:42] man would clutch at a straw
[10:48] make a noise and do something they're
[10:49] groaning because they want to get back
[10:52] to the original state
[10:54] and that's why a person that struck with
[10:56] disease aches and pains one time they
[10:58] were not that way but they are groaning
[11:01] for a perfect body they are groaning to
[11:03] be back in good health
[11:05] amen they know there's something wrong
[11:07] they're trying to get back to the
[11:09] original condition of perfect health
[11:12] right now when nature and people are
[11:14] groaning like the bible just spoke about
[11:16] the groaning it shows us that we are not
[11:19] in our ought to be conditioned
[11:21] because man lost what did men lose their
[11:25] claims on eternal life
[11:29] when adam and eve fell
[11:31] we lost eternal life
[11:34] amen we fell to dip in the garden of
[11:37] eden
[11:38] and when adam fell to death he brought
[11:41] death to creation
[11:44] and he caused greece creation to grow
[11:48] he brought it upon all nature
[11:53] and he brought it to death
[11:55] the earth has never been the same since
[11:58] amen that sweet never died before adam
[12:01] fell and animal this is what the prophet
[12:03] is saying now an animal wouldn't die
[12:05] before adam fell but when we fell to sin
[12:08] we sold out our birthright and crossed
[12:11] that chasm now we are beyond the reach
[12:14] of god on the other side of the chasm
[12:17] and the only thing one thing that cannot
[12:19] die is god
[12:22] so if everything is dying and the only
[12:24] thing that cannot die is god then in
[12:27] order for us to have that eternal life
[12:29] who do we need
[12:31] we need god in our lives
[12:35] we need the source of
[12:36] eternity amen and the only way we can
[12:40] ever keep from dying and have that
[12:41] eternal life amen is to become sons and
[12:45] daughters of god
[12:47] and we find in john 3 16
[12:50] amen it says for god so loved the world
[12:54] that he gave his only begotten son
[12:58] that whosoever believeth in him should
[13:01] not perish
[13:03] but have everlasting life amen there's
[13:06] the key to eternal life
[13:08] believing on jesus
[13:11] for god sent not his son into the world
[13:14] to condemn the world
[13:15] but that the world through him might be
[13:19] saved
[13:21] god has a way to save mankind but man is
[13:24] rejecting his way of salvation
[13:28] he that believeth on him not he is
[13:32] condemned
[13:33] anyone that doesn't believe on jesus the
[13:35] bible is saying is condemned
[13:37] but he that believeth not is condemned
[13:39] already because he had not believed in
[13:42] the name of the only begotten son of god
[13:46] now why is nature groaning why is
[13:48] creation groaning
[13:52] they ever grown
[13:55] and we find it in genesis 1 28
[13:58] when god blessed
[14:00] amen adam
[14:02] and god said unto them
[14:04] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[14:07] the earth and subdue it
[14:10] and have dominion over the fish of the
[14:12] sea over the fall of the air and over
[14:16] every living thing that moved upon the
[14:18] earth
[14:19] amen
[14:20] nature is groaning because man stepped
[14:22] out of this position
[14:25] and the prophet says all nature is
[14:28] waiting for its master
[14:31] the reason nature is grown in creation
[14:33] is groaning the master has fallen
[14:36] the master of the earth is fallen
[14:39] lost his position
[14:45] and the master is the sons of god that
[14:47] was given this earth and now god will
[14:50] have his heavens of course
[14:52] god is god of the heavens he says but
[14:55] this was given to a man and the kinsmen
[14:59] redeemer come back come to redeem us
[15:01] back to death we lost
[15:04] to what we lost amen
[15:07] so creation will never be satisfied
[15:09] if you want to answer creations grown
[15:12] man must come back to their rightful
[15:14] condition amen when its master comes
[15:17] back to its condition
[15:19] where is the master of all circumstance
[15:22] and even though the wind wants to rage
[15:24] he can stand on that boat and say peace
[15:26] be still
[15:28] creation stopped in its tracks and obey
[15:31] the master yes amen
[15:34] even the people man on the earth marvel
[15:37] what manner of man is this that even the
[15:40] winds and the seas obey him
[15:43] hallelujah amen here came a god man
[15:46] walking upon the earth
[15:49] and he was the master of all
[15:50] circumstances
[15:52] amen amen hallelujah he could divide
[15:56] defy the normal laws of the earth he
[16:00] could walk on water amen
[16:02] amen hallelujah after the resurrection
[16:05] he even walked through the wall yes
[16:08] hallelujah amen he could cross
[16:10] dimensions he could go to that seventh
[16:13] dimension and come back to the earth
[16:18] amen and that's what we are coming back
[16:20] to
[16:22] that's our hope
[16:24] that's our inheritance that's our faith
[16:26] that we believe in
[16:28] amen
[16:29] we find that even blood itself has a
[16:32] groan we find with adam in the story of
[16:35] abel we find in genesis 4 10 it says
[16:38] what has thou done done talking to king
[16:42] the voice of thy brother's blood cried
[16:45] unto me from the
[16:49] the blood of the ground
[16:50] martyrs still has a voice
[16:53] it's crying out for their not for for
[16:56] their revenge amen but it's crying out
[16:59] for justice
[17:01] and the goal the great redeemer is the
[17:03] one that is coming with justice
[17:06] to recompense man for all that they've
[17:09] done
[17:10] amen they kill 68 million jews but
[17:13] they're gonna pay for every one of them
[17:18] you can't do something to god's people
[17:20] and get away with it
[17:21] our lord jesus said it's better that a
[17:24] millstone be put around your neck and
[17:26] you'll be cast into the sea
[17:28] then for you to offend one of my little
[17:31] ones
[17:32] that's how much god values you
[17:35] amen hallelujah that's evil's blood
[17:39] abel's blood was crying from the ground
[17:42] but there was nobody to meet the cry of
[17:45] abel's blood
[17:46] amen but hebrews 12 tells us about the
[17:50] amen the last adam and to jesus the
[17:54] mediator of the new covenant and to the
[17:56] blood of sprinkling he has his blood now
[18:00] that speaketh better things than that of
[18:02] abel
[18:04] abel's blood was crying
[18:06] but jesus blood was the answer
[18:10] see that you refuse not him that
[18:14] speaketh amen
[18:16] amen if you are hearing his voice this
[18:19] morning do not refuse him that speaketh
[18:21] amen for if they escape not which
[18:24] refused him that speak on earth
[18:27] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[18:30] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[18:33] amen
[18:34] watch now his voice then shoot the earth
[18:42] did you hear his voice
[18:44] that shook the earth
[18:47] it says amen but now he has promised
[18:49] saying yet once more i shake not the
[18:52] earth only but also heaven
[18:54] and this word yet once more signify the
[18:58] removing of those things that are shaken
[19:01] out of things that are made that those
[19:04] things which cannot be shaken may remain
[19:07] now dwelling on that verse 26 he says
[19:10] whose voice shook the earth
[19:13] hallelujah that's revelation 10.
[19:17] revelation 10
[19:19] when he is coming the mighty angel
[19:21] coming down from heaven close with a
[19:23] cloud rainbow upon his head face as it
[19:26] were the sun his feet are spillage of
[19:28] fire that's a perfect description of
[19:31] christ in the midst of seven golden
[19:34] candlesticks
[19:36] that's why the prophet said only christ
[19:39] you could be
[19:41] and in his hand a little book let's hear
[19:43] for the voice now to shoot the earth
[19:45] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[19:49] john you are type of the bride
[19:51] you had a voice saying i was about to
[19:53] write i heard a voice from heaven saying
[19:55] unto me seal up those things which the
[19:58] seven thunders at it and write them not
[20:01] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[20:04] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[20:07] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[20:09] liveth forever and ever which created
[20:12] heaven and the things that are therein
[20:14] and the earth and the things that are
[20:16] there in what is it talking about all
[20:18] creation
[20:22] amen that there should be time no longer
[20:25] that's what time is talking about there
[20:27] should be delay no longer
[20:30] let there be no longer delay
[20:32] but let the seventh angel come forth
[20:35] let him thunder forth his message
[20:39] amen let's hear what brother branham is
[20:40] saying it says here in revelation book
[20:43] of symbols he says then daniel closing
[20:46] at the last he seen an angel come down
[20:49] so that's the scripture we just read
[20:51] right he says time should be no more at
[20:53] the finishing of that time in other
[20:56] words the body of time that we're living
[20:58] in now
[21:01] from the time and coming of the prince
[21:03] until this day
[21:05] at that time the mystery of god should
[21:08] be finished
[21:13] watch what he says now and the world is
[21:15] groaning
[21:16] waiting today
[21:18] why are they groaning
[21:21] listen to what he says why the world is
[21:24] groaning
[21:25] people don't know the mystery of god
[21:29] isn't that a shame
[21:33] when the mystery has been revealed
[21:36] people don't know the mystery of god
[21:40] he asked the question why they have not
[21:42] been taught the mystery of god
[21:46] the only thing they've been taught is
[21:48] joint church yes
[21:50] put your name on the book
[21:53] be a good fellow treat your neighbor
[21:55] right
[21:56] he says that's all right but you must
[21:58] know the mystery of god
[22:01] amen
[22:03] amen
[22:04] and he says no man can reveal it to you
[22:07] but the one that had the book
[22:09] and the bible says no man can call jesus
[22:12] the christ only by the holy ghost
[22:15] this grand old holy ghost church is
[22:18] going to come out one of these days and
[22:20] shine like you've never seen amen this
[22:23] is the hour for it amen prepare for the
[22:27] hour
[22:28] you're gonna shine amen how you shall be
[22:31] endured with power from an eye
[22:33] the dynamics of this church will be a
[22:36] refilling of the holy ghost
[22:39] he says wait until the dynamics strike
[22:41] the mechanics
[22:44] hallelujah
[22:46] thank you amen
[22:48] oh bless the name of jesus amen you
[22:51] gotta know the mystery of god hallelujah
[22:57] now we are talking about a groaning
[22:59] there can be no new body without the
[23:01] holy spirit amen forget about a new body
[23:05] if we have not been baptized with the
[23:06] holy spirit
[23:08] unless we are filled with the holy
[23:10] spirit our groan is in vain
[23:15] ezekiel 9 and 4
[23:18] and the lord said unto them go through
[23:20] the midst of the city
[23:22] through the midst of jerusalem and set a
[23:25] mark upon the foreheads of the men
[23:27] that sigh
[23:29] and the cry
[23:30] for the abominations that be done in the
[23:33] midst thereof
[23:35] what is the mark that was set
[23:38] forget the mark of the beast
[23:41] god commanded a mark to be placed upon
[23:44] us
[23:46] the prophet says in the seal of god
[23:50] talking about this man that came dressed
[23:51] in white he said let's stop a minute
[23:53] dressed in white righteous holiness
[23:57] dressed in white with an ink on at his
[23:59] side he said go through the city first
[24:01] before they come and put a mark upon the
[24:04] forehead
[24:05] before the mark of the beast can mock
[24:07] you you've already been marked
[24:09] hallelujah
[24:10] you know what a mark signifies a claim
[24:13] has been put on you

[24:20] and boy in the city that sighs and cries
[24:22] for the abominations that's done in the
[24:25] city for the sins of the people put a
[24:27] mark on them amen
[24:31] and then after he went through and march
[24:33] he returned back and said it's done
[24:36] then he sent the men and said go forth
[24:38] and don't you spare nothing but you
[24:40] utterly slay everything that hasn't got
[24:43] a mark on it
[24:46] and he says look here brother
[24:49] now i want to say lookie pay attention
[24:51] what he's saying the marker was none
[24:53] other than the holy spirit
[24:59] he says in in paragraph 188 he says
[25:02] notice if he comes to phoenix
[25:05] tonight
[25:06] you have son of man revealed ministries
[25:10] or any other tabernacle in the city any
[25:12] other church
[25:14] who would he put his mark upon
[25:17] that was so sincere and honest before
[25:19] god that wept
[25:22] that cried
[25:24] and prayed
[25:25] day and night for the sin of the city
[25:29] brother branham knocks on the pulpit two
[25:31] times
[25:35] if we had asked the question amen how
[25:37] many people
[25:38] are signed
[25:40] and crying for the abominations
[25:42] done in the city
[25:49] the master of all circumstances groaned
[25:52] when he came before the grave of lazarus
[25:56] jesus therefore again groaning in
[25:57] himself cometh to the grave
[26:01] it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
[26:05] [Music]
[26:08] remember our message our groaning for
[26:11] immortality
[26:13] every groan will be answered
[26:16] [Music]
[26:18] jesus groaning at the grave
[26:20] his groan was answered
[26:23] acts 7 34
[26:26] the children of that were down in egypt
[26:28] he says i have seen the affliction
[26:30] of my people which is in egypt and i
[26:33] have heard their groaning
[26:35] god responds to the cry
[26:38] of his people
[26:40] and i am come down to deliver them
[26:44] that's the first exodus
[26:46] we are now in our third exodus
[26:49] amen and revelation 10 he has come down
[26:52] to deliver his people
[26:56] i will send thee into egypt
[26:59] this moses whom they refused saying who
[27:02] made the ruler and a judge
[27:05] the same did god send to be ruler and a
[27:07] deliverer by the hand of the angel would
[27:10] appear to him in the bush
[27:13] he brought them out
[27:15] after death he had showed wonders and
[27:18] signs in the land of egypt and in the
[27:20] wilderness 40 years
[27:26] let me re-read that
[27:28] this brand in whom they refuse
[27:31] saying who made thee a ruler and a judge
[27:34] that you come to condemn our women
[27:37] you come to condemn our preachers
[27:40] telling them that they shouldn't be
[27:41] married two or three times
[27:44] condemning their teachings
[27:47] we love three gods
[27:49] [Music]
[27:50] why are you making it one
[27:53] we like variety
[27:55] if the father is angry with me i will go
[27:58] to the loving son
[28:00] if the islam is busy
[28:02] i will commune with the spirit
[28:05] give us three gods
[28:07] we want to be like the other nations yes
[28:12] but here who israel
[28:16] the lord thy god
[28:18] is one lord amen
[28:21] amen amen
[28:25] not only they are grown but
[28:27] even though those jews
[28:29] that were persecuted
[28:32] in the great holocaust
[28:34] revelation 6 talks about their groan
[28:38] and when he had opened the first seal i
[28:40] saw under the altar the souls of them
[28:42] that were slain for the word of god for
[28:44] the testimony which they held and they
[28:47] cried with a loud voice
[28:51] sing out long
[28:54] o lord
[28:55] holy and
[28:56] true thus thou not judge and avenge our
[29:01] blood
[29:02] on them that dwell on the earth yes amen
[29:06] they are crying for justice
[29:13] but god will answer
[29:15] god is fixing to answer their cry the
[29:18] soul's under the altar
[29:20] luke 18 verse 6
[29:22] and the lord said
[29:24] hear what the unjust judge said
[29:27] and shall not god avenge his own elect
[29:30] would cry day and night unto him
[29:32] amen though he be along with him
[29:35] i tell you he will avenge them speedily
[29:40] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[29:43] can he find internet intellectual
[29:45] knowledge on the earth
[29:48] when the son of man cometh will he find
[29:50] big fancy buildings
[29:53] when the son of man cometh will all the
[29:55] preachers have their doctrine
[29:59] when the son of man cometh
[30:02] will the people be heady high-minded
[30:04] lovers of pleasures more than the lovers
[30:07] of god
[30:09] when the son of man cometh will he find
[30:12] us rich increased with goods and have
[30:14] need of nothing
[30:16] is that what he's looking for
[30:20] the bible says when the son of man
[30:22] cometh
[30:24] shall
[30:25] he
[30:27] find
[30:28] faith
[30:30] on the earth amen
[30:33] why
[30:34] we are now in science
[30:36] civilization
[30:38] science has got the people bedazzled
[30:41] that's right
[30:42] we cannot live without modern science
[30:47] amen
[30:49] but will i find faith
[30:51] on the earth
[30:52] amen
[30:55] but there's a secret mystery to it
[30:58] he's asking the question
[31:00] but he's also provided the answer
[31:02] because he sent a message
[31:05] to prepare us for rapturing faith amen
[31:09] amen but it's only a small group
[31:12] it's a minority group
[31:20] let's deal with the groans of the hebrew
[31:21] mothers
[31:23] brother brown telling us that each of
[31:25] those hebrew mothers
[31:27] in their giving birth to their children
[31:30] spoke the very place in their labor
[31:32] pains
[31:33] where they would be positioned in the
[31:35] promised land
[31:37] for those of you that do not understand
[31:39] what's happening here
[31:41] the april mothers were giving birth to
[31:43] their children
[31:45] and under supernatural supernaturally
[31:48] mysteriously
[31:50] they were speaking the names of their
[31:52] sons
[31:54] in their birth pains
[31:57] and the name that they spoke that's
[32:00] exactly where joshua placed them in the
[32:02] land
[32:03] amen
[32:05] he says this is a great mystery
[32:07] the groan of the hebrew mothers
[32:10] joshua not knowing this but by
[32:12] inspiration led of the holy ghost after
[32:14] crossing over the land and taking the
[32:16] land then he divided the land and gave
[32:19] each man his promise
[32:21] amen
[32:22] exactly what the holy spirit promised
[32:25] through the birth back there
[32:28] so they were in their back pain they
[32:29] were screaming in frame
[32:35] menaces
[32:40] god and benjamin there was a groan
[32:43] he says watch those names they have
[32:45] meaning every name in the bible when you
[32:48] see one name in the bible it means
[32:50] something
[32:51] did you know that israel's wives when
[32:53] they gave birth to the 12 patriots each
[32:56] one of those mothers when they were
[32:58] having the baby and the baby was being
[33:01] born and them groaning the groans that
[33:04] came out and named those boys
[33:06] and the very groans that they give
[33:08] signified the nature of the child
[33:12] and the place that they'd make their
[33:13] final resting place
[33:16] now spiritual israel us the church
[33:20] the mother
[33:22] also gave birth let's see what the
[33:24] prophet is saying
[33:26] the church body is also groaned in
[33:28] travail
[33:30] but watch many of us won't like now what
[33:32] came out
[33:35] he says the church pride body has also
[33:37] been going through labor pains
[33:41] and god has said some in the church
[33:42] positionally through the labor pains
[33:46] so they were calling names
[33:48] and the church giving birth
[33:51] also produced
[33:54] sans he says when a church is groaning
[33:56] under the persecution of the outside
[33:59] world
[34:00] believing on the lord jesus that made
[34:02] the promise of the holy ghost is just as
[34:05] real to us as it was on pentecost how
[34:07] they groan and cry under labor pains and
[34:11] when they are born
[34:12] and positionally born into the kingdom
[34:15] then the holy ghost just sit in the
[34:16] church some apostles
[34:18] he gave birth to apostles
[34:21] some teachers some pastors some
[34:24] evangelists
[34:26] then he's given into their speaking my
[34:28] tongues interpretation of tongues
[34:30] knowledge wisdom gifts of healings all
[34:34] kinds of miracles with work into the
[34:36] church
[34:38] receive god's gifts to you amen
[34:40] amen he says here your pastor when he
[34:43] stands here on the platform ministering
[34:46] the word of god he is god's angel to the
[34:48] church
[34:49] messenger to the church therefore a
[34:52] pastor should never leave that word but
[34:54] stay right with the word because he's
[34:57] feeding the shepherd's place because the
[34:59] past the word pastor means shepherd look
[35:02] it up and find out if that ain't right a
[35:04] pastor is a shepherd and the holy ghost
[35:07] has made him overseer over a certain
[35:09] flock to feed them with what the word of
[35:12] god
[35:14] he says every groan amen under the power
[35:17] of the holy ghost
[35:19] he says that's the reason we should be
[35:21] groaning in the spirit that don't mean a
[35:23] lot of this put on i mean really a
[35:27] travail in the church
[35:30] then under the holy spirit you can get
[35:32] some real speaking with tongues and
[35:34] interpretation the holy spirit making
[35:37] utterance that tells through groans and
[35:39] prayers be real truth it'll be something
[35:42] right now that you see take place
[35:48] amen
[35:50] so what's our groaning
[35:53] our groaning
[35:54] is to be clothed with an heavenly
[35:56] dwelling place
[35:58] with immortality
[36:00] let's turn to second corinthians 5 and
[36:02] 1.
[36:03] i'm trying to give you a balance of
[36:04] scriptures
[36:05] with the quotes
[36:07] amen
[36:09] because the quotes what came to make the
[36:11] bible a new book yes amen
[36:16] this is just the teaching place this is
[36:18] just the training ground when you go out
[36:20] there in the world you take your
[36:22] two-edged sword
[36:24] and you open up the scriptures and you
[36:26] expound the word amen based on the quote
[36:30] that gave
[36:33] life to the scripture
[36:35] it says for we know that if our earthly
[36:38] house of this tabernacle were dissolved
[36:41] what is he talking about for those of
[36:42] you that are lost talking about this
[36:44] body
[36:45] this flesh
[36:47] in this earthly house of this tabernacle
[36:49] were dissolved we have a building of god
[36:53] and how it's not made with hands
[36:55] eternally in the heavens amen he says
[36:58] for in this week wrong amen
[37:02] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[37:04] with our heart with our house which is
[37:07] from heaven
[37:10] it's better than the gangnam body
[37:13] better than the churchy body
[37:16] better than the maori body
[37:18] better than the ghanaian body
[37:21] our earthly mother and father gave us
[37:23] this body
[37:24] but the body that's from above
[37:27] much more brighter
[37:29] amen much more glorious
[37:32] hallelujah this one if you don't watch
[37:35] it a few days it stinks
[37:37] we go to a farm and we pull our nose at
[37:40] the stench of the animals
[37:41] but you don't bath a few days
[37:43] because man was made in the image of an
[37:45] animal
[37:47] remember the body was made in the image
[37:49] of an animal
[37:51] right
[37:52] some of you got stumped there you think
[37:54] man was made in the image of god yes
[37:57] the original man
[37:58] spirit man
[38:00] but then he took a body of flesh and he
[38:03] put that spirit in that body
[38:08] some of you acting like you don't know
[38:09] what i'm talking about
[38:13] amen then why
[38:16] does x sell so many deodorants
[38:19] and brute
[38:21] and roll on
[38:23] we are trying to disguise
[38:26] the stinking flesh
[38:30] and every day we are getting older
[38:33] and older
[38:34] and going down
[38:36] to the grave
[38:39] for those of you think you are young
[38:41] brother branham says once you pass 21
[38:43] you are dying every day
[38:49] amen
[38:50] [Music]
[38:53] he says we honestly desire to be clothed
[38:56] upon with our house which is from heaven
[38:58] if so that being clothed we shall not be
[39:01] found naked
[39:04] what does it teach us
[39:06] there are some that are dying
[39:07] and going to the other side and being
[39:09] found naked
[39:11] they have no body
[39:14] so they are wandering spirits
[39:17] with no place of rest
[39:19] sometimes you find the spirits back on
[39:21] the earth
[39:22] that left committed suicide
[39:25] before their time
[39:27] then they say you saw highway sheila
[39:32] brother branham talks one time about
[39:34] these people that were traveling
[39:36] and this lady said she ate a man
[39:40] and he was thrown up in the air
[39:42] and they came down and they looked for
[39:43] the man
[39:44] and they couldn't find him there
[39:46] don't get scared now some of you afraid
[39:48] of top lotion
[39:50] ghosts
[39:51] they won't arm you
[39:53] amen
[39:55] he says they found out that some years
[39:57] ago
[39:58] a man got run over like that
[40:01] but his spirit was roaming
[40:04] the earth
[40:06] what was he found naked
[40:09] no body to go to
[40:12] he says in verse 4
[40:15] for
[40:15] we that are in this tabernacle
[40:18] do groan
[40:19] being burdened
[40:23] not that
[40:24] not for death we would be unclothed but
[40:27] clothed upon that mortality might be
[40:30] swallowed up to life
[40:32] amen
[40:34] now he that wrought us for the self same
[40:36] thing is god who also had given us
[40:40] the earnest of the spirit
[40:43] what is that ephesians 1 you were sealed
[40:46] with the holy spirit of promise
[40:48] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[40:51] until the redemption of the purchased
[40:53] possession
[40:54] unto the praise of his glory
[40:57] he says we are always confident knowing
[40:59] that whilst we are at home in the body
[41:03] we are absent from the lord
[41:09] for we walk by faith not by sight we are
[41:12] confident i say and willing rather to be
[41:14] absent from the body and to be present
[41:17] with the lord amen wherefore we labor
[41:20] that whether we be present or absent we
[41:22] may be accepted of him
[41:25] amen
[41:26] for we must all appear
[41:30] please brother don't read the scripture
[41:31] for me
[41:32] read that quote where it says the bride
[41:34] won't appear in the judgment
[41:36] where we don't have to account please
[41:38] brother
[41:40] don't
[41:41] skip this verse brother
[41:45] for we must all appear
[41:47] are you part of the hall
[41:52] you know brother braham says even though
[41:54] we passed
[41:55] he says we are being judged now by the
[41:56] word he says every man will have to give
[41:58] an account for his life
[42:02] we must all appear before the judgment
[42:04] seat of christ
[42:07] that everyone may receive
[42:10] so it's time for rewards that's what we
[42:12] appear there for
[42:13] for rewards
[42:15] remember brother branham
[42:17] when he appeared there at the time ope
[42:20] slipped a hand
[42:22] under his arm and
[42:23] mira slipped the hand they were going
[42:25] for the rewards
[42:28] everyone may receive the things done in
[42:31] his body
[42:33] according to that which he had done
[42:36] whether it be good
[42:38] or bad
[42:41] judgment day is coming
[42:45] people don't like to hear about judgment
[42:48] preach about grace
[42:53] if you want the grace of god you got to
[42:55] accept his word
[42:56] you got to accept the holy spirit
[42:59] he says how we grown in the spirit to be
[43:01] clothed with them immortal bodies yes
[43:06] now you let's stop here now

[43:54] is that the groan you're talking about

[43:58] how many of you know what i'm talking
[43:59] about
[44:01] amen there's a groan within us
[44:05] longing
[44:11] if you don't feel that way something is
[44:13] wrong

[45:01] because of the earnest of the
[45:03] inheritance
[45:05] that makes man an amateur god
[45:09] that puts back the power in man
[45:12] amen because the holy ghost comes with
[45:14] power
[45:15] the holy ghost comes with demonstration
[45:18] don't talk to me about an holy ghost
[45:20] without power

[45:44] spirit so creation is called and

[45:57] with them waiting for the redemption of
[46:00] our bodies he says now but now now

[46:10] were groaning but up until now right
[46:13] now we have the honest of our
[46:15] inheritance

[48:07] world and now become sons and daughters
[48:10] of god what kind of people should we be
[48:14] we should be a power people we should be

[48:25] than the day before i don't care who
[48:27] falls on one side who falls on the other
[48:30] side but every day with jesus is sweeter
[48:33] than the day before
[48:34] when people are complaining about the
[48:36] petrol price people are complaining
[48:38] about the food prices don't be found
[48:40] among the memories and the complainers
[48:42] but saying my god shall provide amen
[48:46] according to his riches in glory

[49:09] provision because he promised if he
[49:11] takes care of sparrows how much more

[49:32] earnest our spirit is groaning for the
[49:34] full adoption
[49:37] hallelujah
[49:39] you know let me talk to you a little
[49:40] younger ones a little bit you know when
[49:41] you're playing a game and you unlock
[49:43] certain levels
[49:45] and you know they are greater
[49:47] levels but you need to unlock it
[49:50] and now you are groaning now sometimes
[49:52] you may need to buy something
[49:55] you may need to trouble your father your
[49:57] mother to buy you robux
[50:00] or to buy you something
[50:02] in that game so you can unlock its full
[50:05] potential
[50:07] nobody know what i'm talking about
[50:10] nobody
[50:13] amen
[50:15] he says same way
[50:16] we have the honest
[50:18] but we are groaning for the fullness
[50:21] because the earnest is so glorious
[50:24] how much the fullness
[50:28] a many many man
[50:30] when the fullness of time has come
[50:32] god had sent forth his son into the
[50:34] world
[50:35] the master of all circumstance and he
[50:38] walked on water hallelujah
[50:40] and there was a redeemed son
[50:43] not yet fully redeemed
[50:45] because jesus hadn't gone to the cross
[50:48] but he told him peter
[50:50] why don't you
[50:52] step out on the water
[50:54] and you know what forget about the time
[50:56] he doubted peter walked on the water
[50:59] peter walked on the water
[51:03] hallelujah
[51:06] a man full of faith yes that's what we
[51:09] are coming back to
[51:11] that's what we are coming back to
[51:14] amen
[51:15] glory be to his name
[51:18] he says now we have the earnest our
[51:19] spirits groaning for the full adoption
[51:22] but now we have the earnest of it as we
[51:24] receive the holy spirit it is the
[51:26] earnest of all complete adoption or
[51:29] complete salvation oh
[51:31] how beautiful
[51:34] i just love that
[51:38] we are waiting for the fullness of
[51:39] adoption this will take place when
[51:43] he asks the question now
[51:45] this will take place when at the first
[51:48] resurrection
[51:49] then when our bodies will be changed
[51:51] from these vile creatures that we are
[51:54] and will have a body like his own
[51:56] glorious body for we shall see him as he
[51:59] is and we shall be like him when he
[52:01] appears we appear in his likeness we
[52:04] will have a body like his a glorious
[52:07] glorified body and all the trials and
[52:10] struggles of this life will fade off
[52:12] into a little mist and blow away to
[52:15] never be no more amen and these earthly
[52:18] tabernacles that which we're now
[52:20] groaning
[52:21] we're waiting for that earnest
[52:24] for the salvation fully in its fullness
[52:26] to come but now in these tabernacles of
[52:29] clay we have something that tells us we
[52:32] have raised up so far
[52:36] amen
[52:38] what is the earnest it's a little down
[52:40] payment that holds it
[52:42] it's the earnest he says oh my oh my
[52:46] don't that makes us all full folks feel
[52:49] good
[52:50] in order to make us all feel good
[52:52] waiting for this hour we understand this
[52:55] will take place at the first
[52:56] resurrection but oh what a blessed hope
[52:59] for the believer that's lifting up hands
[53:01] for our redemption is drawing nigh when
[53:04] he sees these things appearing it's a
[53:06] great time for the believer
[53:11] even more when that mighty angel has
[53:13] descended
[53:15] with the title deed of our inheritance
[53:18] redemption is much closer than when the
[53:21] holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost
[53:24] we are at the finishing line this is not
[53:26] the starting line
[53:29] amen
[53:32] he says
[53:33] in faith is the substance while we're
[53:36] groaning veiled in this tabernacle of
[53:38] humiliation
[53:40] oh some of us don't like humiliation
[53:44] you try and correct this fellow
[53:48] muscles start to grow
[53:51] anger muscles
[53:53] cure
[53:54] but poor was it john or james tells us
[53:58] tame this fellow
[54:02] tame him
[54:04] because some people
[54:07] have super power anger
[54:13] for that they don't have the earnest
[54:15] they got the fullness
[54:19] anger like a puzzle
[54:23] but he says sweeten your temper with
[54:26] hello sweeten your temper well
[54:30] i don't like to play why are you asking
[54:31] me to repeat that word
[54:34] sweeten your temple with
[54:38] amen
[54:43] veil in the tabernacle of humiliation
[54:46] he says if you want to see if somebody
[54:47] got the holy spirit
[54:49] and they are dead really dead he says
[54:52] kick them a little bit
[54:54] now please don't all of your russian
[54:55] come after the service to kick me
[54:59] he says then watch if that old nature
[55:01] rises up again
[55:06] we have the earnest of our perfect
[55:08] complete redemption like we was in the
[55:12] beginning when god created adam in the
[55:15] garden of eden amen
[55:18] can we read that
[55:21] let's read it one two three we have the
[55:24] earnest
[55:26] okay
[55:27] let's try that again
[55:30] we have the earnest of our perfect
[55:33] complete redemption back like we was in
[55:36] the beginning when god created adam in
[55:38] the garden of eden amen
[55:42] now if we got it why aren't we using it
[55:45] why aren't we calling those things which
[55:46] are not as though it is
[55:49] why aren't we speaking the word amen
[55:51] why are we lazy
[55:55] you'll say when i see the heavens split
[55:57] open
[55:58] and the glory of the lord descending
[56:01] then i'll know it's time brother
[56:03] now is the time
[56:05] now are we the sons of god
[56:09] yes
[56:11] god has given us
[56:13] amen the ammunition we need
[56:16] he says greater than the atomic bomb
[56:20] is a man filled with the holy ghost we
[56:22] can pray
[56:23] it will annihilate death the devil's
[56:25] kingdom
[56:28] but it's tedious
[56:30] stop asking me to pray
[56:32] but that's the weapon amen
[56:37] he says we have a fourteenth of glory
[56:39] divine by the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:42] the refreshment coming from the presence
[56:45] of god to water the church to make it
[56:48] grow in grace
[56:51] and when we sick we have redemption
[56:54] the blessing the attributes of the death
[56:57] of christ divine healing as a foresight
[57:00] to us
[57:01] that someday this mortal will take on
[57:03] immortality
[57:05] yes sir oh my marvelous he's here to do
[57:09] it glory
[57:12] he says just as there was pains and
[57:14] groanings in the first birth of natural
[57:17] they'll have to be
[57:18] the same thing in the second making a
[57:20] man a new creature in christ jesus

[58:37] final groan
