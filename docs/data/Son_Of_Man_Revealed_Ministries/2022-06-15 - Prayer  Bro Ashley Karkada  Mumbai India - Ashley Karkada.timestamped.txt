[7:36] to see him for he was to pass that way
[7:40] today
[7:41] god is passing this way
[7:45] glory to his name and when jesus came to
[7:47] the
[7:48] place
[7:49] he looked up and saw saw him
[7:51] and said unto him zacchaeus make haste
[7:55] and come down

[8:19] amen amen glory to his name and he made
[8:22] haste and came down see he came waste
[8:24] and he came down and received him
[8:26] joyfully
[8:27] and when they saw it
[8:29] they all murmured saying
[8:31] that he was gone to be a guest with a
[8:34] man that is a sinner
[8:36] and zakai stood and said unto the lord
[8:38] behold
[8:39] lord the half of my goods i gave to the
[8:42] poor and if i have taken anything from
[8:45] any man
[8:46] by false accusation i restored him
[8:49] fourfold
[8:51] and jesus said unto him
[8:53] this day is salvation come to this house
[8:56] for as much as he also is a son of
[8:59] abraham

[9:03] to save that which was lost
[9:06] we were lost my brother sister he came
[9:08] amen we never went to him but he came to
[9:11] us amen amen now we will read
[9:15] matthew 9

[9:22] is meeting some man
[9:24] in the end entering of the gate
[9:27] had he entered
[9:31] and he entered into a sorry nine i'm
[9:33] sorry
[9:34] and as jesus passed forth
[9:37] from thence he saw a man named matthew
[9:39] sitting at the receipt of custer and
[9:41] they said unto him follow me
[9:43] and he arose and followed him and it
[9:46] came to pass as jesus said at meet in
[9:48] the house behold many publicans and
[9:51] sinners came and sat down with him and
[9:55] his disciples

[16:13] in those days jericho in the time of
[16:16] jesus
[16:17] the all the rich people

[16:49] place
[16:50] when jesus entered into that place the
[16:53] jericho
[16:55] he saw that that city is kind of a oh
[16:57] city
[16:58] that he herod also built a
[17:01] a house over there because it was a warm
[17:04] climate and the fresh water was
[17:06] springing water was coming the bible

[36:42] when i am giving a time to him for
[36:44] prayer
[36:45] if anybody comes knocks the door
[36:48] maybe sometimes what we do when he comes

[38:52] the scripture has fulfilled what brother
[38:54] graham has said the sixth phrase is
[38:56] fulfilled now
[38:57] in our front of our eyes the scripture
[39:00] has been fulfilled
[39:02] what brother branham is saying the angel
[39:04] of the lord is holding
[39:07] russia's hand amen why
[39:10] for one believer
[39:12] amen patiently waiting for us my brother

[40:20] people were praying and crying and
[40:22] crying lord this karuna virus take away
[40:25] god took that
[40:26] but whatever now amen you have to leave
[40:29] the present day
[40:34] glory to you my brother
[40:39] the blind man never stopped there
[40:41] he cried

[41:42] he got the sight
[41:44] when you will cry
[41:46] whatever you ask
[41:49] he will give it to you
[41:53] because the banana says
[41:54] because of the ukraine god will make
[41:56] upset down
[41:58] to save one bride
[42:04] and god is doing the same thing
[42:07] in our front in our eyes scripture has
[42:10] been fulfilled but still
[42:14] we have not warmed up to ourselves
[42:23] glory to his name amen
[42:35] his name you know what is his name
[42:37] meaning of name in hebrew
[42:40] the pure one innocent
[42:42] the name in hebrew
[42:45] but he was not a honest man
[42:47] he was a dishonest man he was cheating
[42:50] his fellow citizen
[42:52] he was taking money from
[42:53] many people because he was under roman
[42:57] he was under roman system
[43:00] and that time they used to bid for that
[43:03] post
[43:04] now also is in the government form in
[43:06] the customs office if you want to get
[43:09] some good post or good area who can make
[43:11] money they were bearing
[43:13] the same same way in those days
[43:17] they were bidding
[43:18] and he was in under roman
[43:20] system
[43:23] roman wants maybe a hundred thousand
[43:25] rand today so other than what you make
[43:28] that is yours
[43:30] so that's how he was cheating people he
[43:33] made money he'd become rich
[43:38] but see his name what is pronounced
[43:46] he was a pure
[43:47] pure one innocent
[43:53] and sakura worked under the encouraged
[43:55] corruption
[43:58] he was encouraging corruption
[44:01] he was working under human system

[44:39] see every common
[44:44] the devil is sitting in that government
[44:46] office
[44:48] and you have a spiritual office

[57:55] not even the amount of devil
[57:59] only the owner
[58:02] the seal can open
[58:06] you are a heavily brown creature my
[58:08] brother sister
[58:12] if your prayer life is loose
[58:14] it's not going to seed you
[58:25] once brother
[58:26] level dr lee will ask brother branham
[58:29] what is the evidence of the holy ghost
[58:32] dr lee will ask you know the doctor
[58:40] what is the evidence of the holy ghost
[58:44] that man was thinking is love
[58:46] yeah
[58:47] the man was thinking it's love
[58:51] but what angel of the lord told brother
[58:54] let me give that code so you will
[58:56] understand what i'm saying
[58:59] it's in 640726e
[59:02] broken sixteens
[59:04] yeah
[59:05] tara sixty-seven
[59:07] the when i was saying i said the most
[59:10] perfect evidence i can think is love
[59:12] he's saying that
[59:13] okay
[59:15] but he says but one day the lord in a
[59:18] vision
[59:19] straightened me out see in a reason
[59:22] what he was thinking god is telling
[59:24] something to you yeah
[59:26] that is a human mind what we think
[59:27] sometimes
[59:28] but don't think in a human mind
[59:30] let the mind of christ be in you
[59:34] he is also thinking like a human yeah
[59:36] definitely i will also say something
[59:38] like that
[59:38] also something yeah it's a love yeah
[59:40] love is a portion
[59:43] but he says
[59:45] the evidence of the spirit
[59:47] was those
[59:49] who could receive the word
[59:51] amen
[59:53] neither love
[59:54] nor speaking intense but it is receiving
[59:57] the word
[59:59] amen amen
[1:00:00] when you receive the word when you obey
[1:00:03] the word then the holy spirit will come
[1:00:05] in you
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:07] but you don't want to receive the word
[1:00:09] and you want the holy spirit
[1:00:12] then how he's going to see you
[1:00:14] love is good
[1:00:16] because brother branham and jesus said
[1:00:19] when he went out he said love one
[1:00:21] another that was his 11th commandment
[1:00:27] but when you receive the word then the
[1:00:29] word will change you and the love will
[1:00:31] come in you amen
[1:00:34] when the love is coming you then you
[1:00:36] will have a favor with your brother and
[1:00:38] sister
[1:00:38] that's a grace
[1:00:40] and the same grace god did to us
[1:00:47] he said i have chosen you
[1:00:50] you are not chosen
[1:00:51] that was a favor he had upon us because
[1:00:54] he was loving us that's why he had a
[1:00:56] grace upon us
[1:01:04] he wrote to receive the word and he want
[1:01:06] the holy ghost
[1:01:09] first receive the word believe the word
[1:01:12] what brother branham is saying
[1:01:16] just believe
[1:01:20] he never say understand the message
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:37] we don't understand
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:42] same thing happened in the garden of
[1:01:44] eden the devil went straight away to the
[1:01:47] congregation
[1:01:49] he never went to the pastor
[1:01:53] if he has gone to the pastor adam
[1:01:57] then adam would have told him through
[1:01:59] the word
[1:02:01] sometimes you don't know the word then
[1:02:04] be with pastor pray for him

[1:06:43] the same way he called by name to us
[1:06:47] if jesus would call
[1:06:49] come forth all the dead bodies would
[1:06:51] have come out
[1:06:53] amen but no by name he called and the
[1:06:56] same he is calling us today by our name
[1:07:04] you have to be ready maybe it's the last
[1:07:06] time for us
[1:07:08] jesus stood and said
[1:07:09] come here come first

[1:07:43] accusation by anything i have taken
[1:07:45] i will give fourfold
[1:07:47] see he repented
[1:07:50] we don't want to repent
[1:07:54] but we want to keep the record of others

[1:08:00] but don't keep the record of others let
[1:08:02] your record keep clean with god amen

[1:09:11] is the leader of
[1:09:13] a brand
[1:09:17] maybe she was in that condition

[1:14:16] do
[1:14:17] more for the lord we can live a more
[1:14:19] surrendered life a more consecrated life
[1:14:22] and if we sit in that seat where we feel
