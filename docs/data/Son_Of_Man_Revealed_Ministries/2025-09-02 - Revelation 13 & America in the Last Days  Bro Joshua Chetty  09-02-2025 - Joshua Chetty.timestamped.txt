[7:09] amen amen because this is the age of
[7:11] deception right amen the greatest
[7:14] deception is in this age amen but this
[7:16] is the age where the mind of Christ has
[7:18] come down amen so this bride knows the
[7:22] has the mind of Christ and she knows
[7:24] what he wants done with the word and she
[7:26] only moves when he says move amen amen
[7:30] because she's one with the word amen
[7:32] she's coming to full submission to the

[8:07] then you are the holy people of God amen
[8:10] amen amen because you have to come
[8:12] through a new birth because your first
[8:14] birth brought you in a problem your
[8:17] first birth brought you in a slave and
[8:20] bondage it brought you in a spirit of
[8:22] fear but by the new birth you no longer
[8:25] have the spirit of fear but of power and
[8:28] of a sound mind
[8:30] amen and by this birth now you recognize
[8:33] your true potential by this birth you
[8:36] recognize who you truly are where you
[8:38] truly come from because your birth
[8:40] brings you into connection with your
[8:42] father amen but the first birth your
[8:45] connection came to your Earthly father
[8:47] brought you into the natural body but
[8:50] when you come at a new birth you come
[8:51] into your connection through your
[8:53] Eternal Father amen yes sir which is God
[8:56] amen amen amen if you got your Bible
[8:59] this morning
[9:00] morning we'll turn to the Book of
[9:02] Revelation chapter
[9:05] 13 read from vers
[9:08] 11 let's see what the Lord has in store
[9:10] for us this
[9:20] morning the Book of Revelation 13 11
[9:24] says and I beheld another Beast coming
[9:27] out up out of the Earth and he had two
[9:30] horns like a lamb and he spake as a
[9:34] dragon and he exercises all the power of
[9:37] the first Beast before him and causes
[9:40] the Earth and them which dwell therein
[9:44] to worship the first Beast who whose
[9:47] deadly wound was
[9:51] ill and he doth great wonders so that he
[9:54] make it fire come down from heaven on
[9:57] the earth in the sight of men
[9:59] and deceiveth them that dwell on the
[10:01] Earth by the means of those Miracles
[10:04] which he had power to do in the sight of
[10:05] the Beast saying to them that dwell on
[10:07] the earth that they should make an image
[10:09] to the Beast which had the own by a
[10:12] sword and did live and he had power to
[10:14] give life unto the image of the
[10:17] Beast that the image of the Beast should
[10:20] both speak and
[10:22] cause that as many as would not worship
[10:24] the image of the Beast should be killed
[10:27] and he caused it all both small and
[10:29] great rich and poor free and born to
[10:31] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[10:33] their
[10:34] foreheads and that no man might buy or
[10:37] shall say he that had the Mark or the
[10:39] name of the Beast or the number of his
[10:42] name yeah is wisdom let him that had
[10:44] understanding count the number of the
[10:46] Beast which is the number of a man which
[10:47] is number is 63 score and six amen you
[10:51] may be seated
[10:54] amen so we want to put emphasis on the
[10:57] verses 12
[11:00] and he exercised all the power of the
[11:03] first Beast before
[11:06] him and causes the Earth and them which
[11:11] dwell therein to worship the first Beast
[11:16] whose deadly un was
[11:19] healed okay so we know the first Beast
[11:23] represents uh Pagan Rome becoming people
[11:26] Rome right which was Catholicism right
[11:29] we know that right and the second beast
[11:32] represent the United States which
[11:34] started as a lamb yes Christian
[11:37] Nation right but yeah we see now later
[11:41] speaks like a dragon so it's going to
[11:45] exercise the power of the first
[11:51] beast and so we know the this image to
[11:54] the Beast is actually the Protestant
[11:57] Church United with the Catholic church
[12:00] was The ecumenical movement the World
[12:01] Council of
[12:02] churches right what they doing they're
[12:05] forming a religious political system
[12:07] just
[12:08] like it was in the days like how the
[12:12] Catholic Church did amen because we now
[12:15] we we want to put emphasis on his part
[12:18] he exercised all the power of the first
[12:21] Beast before him so we know that this
[12:23] Beast the second beast is the United
[12:25] States so we must look at what power was
[12:29] exercise but the first Beast because we
[12:32] want to see what power he's exercising
[12:35] now so we want to speak on this morning
[12:38] by the grace of God on the title
[12:41] Revelation 13 and America in the last
[12:44] days and on the coming squeeze of the
[12:48] Bride amen so we know the prophet speaks
[12:51] about history repeating
[12:54] itself so we find something very
[12:57] significant here
[12:59] because we're looking at the scripture
[13:01] in vers 12 which says that this Beast is
[13:04] going to exercise the power of the first
[13:06] Beast so when we look at
[13:10] history we find that you you know the
[13:12] the proper in the church age book he
[13:14] teaches us about
[13:17] Constantine who played a significant
[13:19] role in the corruption of true
[13:22] [Music]
[13:24] Christianity and we know that
[13:28] Constantine was more a political
[13:31] figure rather than what he portrayed to
[13:34] be as a Christian because the prophet of
[13:36] God told us that he wasn't he didn't
[13:38] have a true
[13:40] conversion but it was portrayed as if he
[13:42] had a
[13:43] conversion because when Pagan Rome was
[13:46] falling
[13:47] apart because remember even at that time
[13:51] when Pagan Rome was falling apart the
[13:52] Christians were
[13:54] persecuted there was a persecution of
[13:56] Christianity
[14:00] and even Nero before Conant Constantine
[14:03] he burned Rome and he blamed the
[14:05] Christians and then they they come to
[14:07] realize that it was not why are they
[14:10] doing this to Christians and Constantine
[14:13] realized that there were so many people
[14:15] being influenced by
[14:16] Christianity and he realized that a way
[14:18] to save this kingdom was to get on the
[14:22] side of the Christian amen or to get
[14:25] them to be part of the
[14:26] states and that's when we see church and
[14:29] state uniting together which was forming
[14:33] the bases that later will flow into the
[14:36] the paper
[14:37] room but this was the emperor that set
[14:39] the stage in
[14:41] order this was the emperor that said
[14:44] that he had a
[14:48] dream and you know the the dream that he
[14:50] had that he was going to it was just
[14:52] happening at a time before he was going
[14:55] to go to a
[14:56] war and he he saw a vision of oh he says
[15:01] that he saw a vision of a cross in the
[15:02] sky with the
[15:04] words uh in in when you convert it it
[15:07] means in this sign
[15:11] conquer so what he did he adopted the
[15:13] Christian symbol of the
[15:15] Cross
[15:16] and establish to everyone that he was
[15:19] converted but we know the prophet of God
[15:21] told us it wasn't a
[15:25] conversion but what he wanted to do it
[15:27] was a strategic move M it was because
[15:30] remember he was the emperor and he had a
[15:33] kingdom that's falling apart but it was
[15:35] a strategic move to unify his empire
[15:39] under a single
[15:41] religion blending Christianity with
[15:44] paganism and to make it a Empire a force
[15:49] to reckon with because that's what
[15:51] happened we see the Tyranny and the
[15:54] force of the Roman Empire at the time
[15:59] so what happened
[16:01] was that became more a political church
[16:06] when church and state unite it becomes a
[16:09] political
[16:11] church but we know in the uning time and
[16:14] sign we know that there's also a true
[16:17] Union not between church and
[16:20] state but between the bride of
[16:25] Christ which had the new birth amen she
[16:28] she was connected to her
[16:31] father because your birth brings you in
[16:33] connection to your
[16:35] father and when she comes under the new
[16:37] birth she comes under this Divine
[16:39] connection and realizes that she come
[16:42] from God and that she must go back to
[16:45] Goden then she realizes that she's not
[16:48] part of this world this world Cosmos yes
[16:52] this world system she's not part of she
[16:55] might have been stuck in those
[16:57] denominations she might have been stuck
[17:00] in the chicken
[17:01] barnyards but when Mama Eagle came
[17:03] crying out when the shout came out Amen
[17:08] to germinate that seed within her when a
[17:11] shout came and captivated her she began
[17:13] to realize who she truly is she began to
[17:17] realize why she couldn't conform to the
[17:20] chicken barard she began to realize why
[17:23] that chicken food couldn't satisf fire
[17:25] her she began to realize there was
[17:27] something more about her
[17:29] amen
[17:31] amen so we find that under constantin's
[17:34] rule there was a formation of a
[17:37] political church cuz why he declared
[17:40] Christianity the favorite religion of
[17:42] the Roman
[17:44] Empire and he began to give the church
[17:46] political
[17:48] power and this led to the nicolan spirit
[17:51] ruling over the
[17:54] lady which the prophet to us was
[17:57] condemned in the book of re ration amen
[18:00] amen yes amen so what it was the
[18:03] blending of paganism and
[18:06] Christianity doesn't that remind you of
[18:08] aab and Jezebel aab to unify and
[18:11] strengthen his kingdom he brought
[18:13] Jezebel in he come into a marriage Union
[18:16] with
[18:17] Jezebel only to know that he was a
[18:19] backsliding
[18:20] person and because he was in his back in
[18:23] condition he eventually it would be
[18:25] Jezebel's rule over Israel not ahab's
[18:28] rule it was Jessel Beyond The
[18:31] Throne yet aab was there back and
[18:33] preacher but who was influencing it was
[18:36] Jezebel influencing behind the
[18:39] throne so we know that in the days of
[18:42] Constantine they allowed Pagan Customs
[18:46] to be merged with Christianity leading
[18:48] to the eventually leading to the
[18:50] formation of the Catholic church because
[18:53] after
[18:54] Constantine there was another person who
[18:58] would come in
[18:59] and him through him would come now the
[19:02] pap he become the first
[19:04] pope and and and then you find the pap
[19:07] system in full power and you have the
[19:08] Dark
[19:12] Ages so you find
[19:15] that so who he was who was Constantine
[19:18] really he was basically
[19:21] deceiving he was deceiving about his
[19:25] conversion but only the two Believers at
[19:28] that time time the true Holy Ghost
[19:31] believers who wouldn't want to be
[19:34] influenced by church and state coming
[19:37] together they wouldn't be part of the
[19:40] system they wouldn't be deceived by this
[19:44] because they realize that this system is
[19:46] not of God they realize that the church
[19:48] has to be led by the Holy
[19:51] Spirit not being influenced by political
[19:54] influence amen
[19:57] amen and they knew according to the
[20:01] scripture that it wasn't the time of
[20:04] Millennium Reign because one day Christ
[20:07] will come
[20:08] again amen because there was a promise
[20:11] in the scripture that Christ will come
[20:12] as son of David Son of David he'll come
[20:15] to rule and reign as king of kings amen
[20:18] amen he's coming the days as son of man
[20:20] as the
[20:21] prophets amen he's come as Son of God
[20:25] but he must come in between the son of
[20:26] man again before he comes as son of of
[20:29] Davids but the True Believers know that
[20:32] and they wouldn't come into the
[20:34] system and then what happened the people
[20:36] that will come in system they was given
[20:39] political
[20:41] status and they was given positions in
[20:43] the church they was given uh property
[20:48] they was given land they was given all
[20:50] these
[20:52] rights but I want you to watch it's all
[20:56] deception and it was the beginning
[20:58] beginning of the departure of a
[21:01] Apostolic Doctrine leading to the r rise
[21:05] of Catholicism and ultimately spiritual
[21:08] corruption that continued Through the
[21:12] Ages until we find now this land America
[21:16] the United States that started off as a
[21:19] lamb where the people fled for freedom
[21:22] of
[21:24] religion which wanted to come out of
[21:28] church and States who wanted to come out
[21:31] to worship the one true
[21:33] God which wanted to recognize In God We
[21:37] Trust which build a constitution on the
[21:40] foundation of the principles of the
[21:41] Bible yes sir and wanted a religion
[21:45] where that doesn't where it doesn't mix
[21:47] up with states where is not influenced
[21:50] by
[21:52] politics and they wanted to follow the
[21:54] Bible the way it's supposed to be
[21:56] because God has put the five4
[22:00] Ministry in place to bring the church to
[22:03] Perfection amen amen amen
[22:07] amen and we find that we are living in a
[22:10] time
[22:12] now where America
[22:15] eventually the prophet of God say it was
[22:18] under
[22:19] Kennedy President Kennedy that aab came
[22:22] into the White House because woman was
[22:25] given the right to vote and under the
[22:27] woman's vote it brought the wrong man
[22:31] in it might have been good in the side
[22:34] of the
[22:35] people but what they didn't
[22:37] realize they brought aab in which will
[22:41] come into a union with
[22:43] Jezebel and that's where it will
[22:46] start this nation that started off as a
[22:49] Godly Nation will turn away from god
[22:53] Till eventually they come into such
[22:55] moral Decay oh yes into such a Sodom
[23:00] condition that now they were cry for a
[23:04] Superman someone to save them instead of
[23:07] crying out to
[23:08] God the Bible said those that are full
[23:11] with the Holy Ghost sigh and cry for the
[23:13] abomination of the Lost instead of
[23:15] recognizing God's true prophet in the
[23:18] land that came and told them about this
[23:21] jel system amen yes sir when God's true
[23:24] Prophet was in the land in message was
[23:26] rejected
[23:29] they had an opportunity to repent and
[23:32] believe the true prophet of
[23:36] God but instead of believing the true
[23:38] prophet of God they were setting the
[23:40] ways they were happy accumulating their
[23:44] wealth they was happy living in a in a
[23:47] Land of n of national of being a patriot
[23:52] country because why they was focusing on
[23:54] being
[23:55] Earthbound they was focusing on the
[23:57] flesh caral
[24:00] things but what they didn't realize
[24:03] God's Prophet work that
[24:05] land amen and he measur that land with a
[24:08] yard stick amen they were found wanting
[24:11] waiting the balances of God
[24:15] yes and the message of the hour was
[24:19] rejected and what what happened they
[24:21] went into moral dek
[24:23] right and when they went into moral DK
[24:27] just want to read this one P you
[25:15] he said the strange behavior of Moses
[25:17] and Moses Elijah and John withdrawing
[25:21] from the people into seclusion left many
[25:25] confused they did not realize that it
[25:29] was because their messages had been
[25:34] rejected but the seed had been
[25:37] sown the planting was over oh yes
[25:42] judgment was
[25:44] next and they had served their purpose
[25:48] as a sign to the people so what was next
[25:52] and judgment was
[25:56] next I believe according to Revelation
[25:59] 13:16 that the bride will have to stop
[26:02] preaching for the Beast is demanding the
[26:05] mark in the end or for if permission to
[26:08] preach be granted the nominations will
[26:11] take the Mark or be forced to put
[26:14] preaching then the lamb will come for
[26:16] his bride and judge the great
[26:22] others so we
[26:24] know who the mother is the mother is
[26:27] Rome the Bible say the mother is the
[26:28] home but the daughters are
[26:31] hars our daughters are who every
[26:35] denominational system coming from the
[26:37] Protestants
[26:43] right doesn't in a time of moral Decay
[26:48] doesn't religion seem good in a time
[26:51] where where America has become so
[26:55] bad in such moral decay
[26:59] the moral morality has declined so
[27:02] badly that wouldn't it seem good if
[27:06] somebody come and speak good things
[27:08] let's stop the moral Decay let's bring
[27:11] religion back wouldn't that seem
[27:17] good but then if that seemed good did it
[27:21] help then when we had Pharisees and
[27:23] Sadducees who followed the law were holy
[27:25] people was that just what God wanted
[27:29] good did God just want good morals did
[27:32] God just want good ethics no he wanted
[27:34] us to come into submission to the words
[27:37] amen amen amen he called the people to
[27:39] come to full submission to the words
[27:41] amen
[27:43] amen did God ask us to rely on any man
[27:48] no that's what the people of the world
[27:50] is looking for a Superman and he said
[27:52] they'll have the
[27:55] superman but we find this Beast the
[27:58] second beast he exercises all the power
[28:01] of the first Beast before
[28:04] him and cause the Earth and them which
[28:09] dwell therein to worship the first Beast
[28:13] so there must be a political power and
[28:16] influence so strong because this Beast
[28:18] is America the second beast is America
[28:22] but it must come to a time where the the
[28:24] influence is so strong and so forceful
[28:27] that that she must influence the rest of
[28:29] the earth
[28:31] yes to go under the policies of Rome
[28:37] right and we find that that can't happen
[28:40] under moral DK it has to be in
[28:43] deception because if Satan comes in and
[28:47] shows you in Sodom condition and the
[28:49] people in Sodom condition you're going
[28:50] to you're going to know that he's
[28:52] ungodly but if he going to bring it in
[28:55] the form of
[28:56] religion all those lukewarm
[28:59] Believers or all those lukewarm
[29:02] Christians like aab and so forth they're
[29:04] going to be
[29:05] deceived they going to think this is a
[29:07] good thing
[29:09] amen and what happened when church and
[29:12] state comes together what's going to
[29:14] happen you're going to
[29:18] find that people will be given certain
[29:22] Privileges and they going to think
[29:24] that's a good thing
[29:27] amen we know that Constantine he claimed
[29:30] to see the vision of the
[29:32] Cross but we know that by his action we
[29:36] use Christianity for political gain and
[29:38] through what the proper has shown us
[29:41] amen I know that many Christian authors
[29:43] and historians Proclaim him to be
[29:46] Christian but the prophet of God told us
[29:49] what he used it for amen
[29:52] amen and we see right now in modern
[29:55] America with the current events that are
[29:57] happening
[29:58] we see there's a president that presents
[30:01] himself as a champion of Christian
[30:03] values which seems like a good thing
[30:06] after having a president that supported
[30:09] all the Sodom
[30:13] condition but we find
[30:17] that you can't make church and state
[30:21] together yes amen and to come to profess
[30:26] to be a Christian or to come the
[30:28] Christian value you must be born again
[30:32] until you are born again you have no
[30:34] connection to the
[30:36] father amen amen your natural
[30:39] birth your natural body was because of a
[30:42] it brings you to a connection to your
[30:43] Earthly father you come out of the
[30:45] loines of your Earthly
[30:46] father but when you have a new birth now
[30:49] you're connected to your father amen
[30:52] that is why you can fully submit to your
[30:54] father that's why you can truly
[30:56] understand that you have eternal life
[30:57] amen amen because you you know your
[31:00] father is eternal
[31:03] amen so we find that the Constantine
[31:06] made Christianity the official religion
[31:07] of Rome he merged church and government
[31:12] power we find right now
[31:14] America as it founded it was declared as
[31:17] a Christian Nation that's the true
[31:19] founding of
[31:20] America but right now we find that even
[31:23] now more
[31:24] so there's now political alliance with
[31:27] Evangelical of America yes Evangelical
[31:32] leaders evangelicals are aligning
[31:34] themselves with the current
[31:36] administration of
[31:38] America and we know what
[31:41] brought remember Constantine was going
[31:43] to a war into a battle and before he
[31:47] goes to the battle that's why he
[31:49] professed to have this vision of the
[31:51] Cross yes and then to get the Christian
[31:54] on his side that's how you won the
[31:56] battle now we know that the elections in
[31:59] America they were speaking about
[32:01] Battlegrounds and we know how the
[32:03] current president president got his
[32:05] votes it was through the Catholics and
[32:07] through the evangelicals it wasn't just
[32:09] the Catholics it was all the
[32:11] conservatives Christian
[32:13] people Catholics and Protestants
[32:16] together right people want was tired of
[32:20] moral Decay they wanted a
[32:23] change but we said the true change can
[32:25] only come with God's son forming power
[32:29] am they had a true hero in America God's
[32:32] Prophet amen they had a true hero to
[32:36] rely upon they could have taken God's
[32:39] Prophet as the hero because he War them
[32:41] of the oncoming storms of judgment
[32:44] before they even go to World War II he
[32:45] told him America will going to World War
[32:50] II and he told them he given he say if
[32:53] you repent I give America the chance to
[32:56] repent and they had the chance to
[32:58] repent but they
[33:06] refuse now we find that all this seems
[33:09] Rosy all seems
[33:12] good but this political alliance with
[33:15] evangelicals the Protestants and the
[33:18] Catholics
[33:20] eventually they will make it into a
[33:22] formal
[33:23] religion where will formalized laws
[33:29] and those that come against them preach
[33:32] against I mean he given uh a preacher
[33:36] Paula White k a big position in the
[33:39] White House to lead this Faith
[33:44] movement he's given a Jersy Bell
[33:48] preacher a position now if you going
[33:52] speak against these things you think
[33:54] that will be light
[33:58] if you going to speak the truth that a
[33:59] woman shouldn't be preaching in the
[34:00] first
[34:01] place yes sir which are apart from the
[34:06] message which other institution which
[34:09] other people will truly prophesy these
[34:11] things again yes which other people hold
[34:14] on to God's word as it is and say a
[34:17] woman should be preaching an adulterous
[34:20] woman Paula White and Kane look at her
[34:22] name her last marriage by because of her
[34:25] last marriage took the name Cain
[34:35] so we looking at these things happening
[34:38] now we see that there's a
[34:41] big uh push for Christian
[34:45] nationalism just as our Constantine use
[34:48] Christianity SOL SOL solidify power to
[34:51] bring power
[34:55] together and now we find that
[34:59] there going to be laws in there's laws
[35:01] put in place now executive order sign
[35:04] for for people that will come against
[35:08] Christianity that for Christian for
[35:11] people who now will uh come against this
[35:14] Christian worship all that seems good
[35:17] isn't
[35:18] it wouldn't that be good they bring in
[35:21] laws to protect
[35:23] Christianity but in that same laws can
[35:26] be amended
[35:28] to go against certain
[35:30] beliefs yes amen
[35:34] amen so we find that evangelicals
[35:37] aligning with political power same with
[35:39] the the Catholic church and the that is
[35:41] remember under remember that clip we
[35:44] played in the time of Kenneth copelan
[35:47] sending the message to the that that
[35:49] priest came to Kenneth Copeland's church
[35:51] and he also met to the pope how they
[35:53] said that the Reformation is over I mean
[35:55] sorry the protest the protest is over
[35:57] yes and how they all came into alignment
[36:00] with the Protestant church and the
[36:01] Catholic church that was the start of it
[36:05] but now they needed the political
[36:07] influence there was now the religious
[36:10] influence but they needed now the
[36:12] political influence to push all these
[36:15] things
[36:16] together to form an image to the Beast
[36:18] to make this image
[36:24] live so we find that at a National
[36:27] Prayer breakfast in February which
[36:29] happened the last the other day the
[36:32] president Trump announced initiative to
[36:33] combat perceived anti-christian bias
[36:37] within the F federal government he
[36:40] stated this is his word we will not
[36:42] allow discriminations against Christians
[36:44] to
[36:45] stand now I'm taking you back to history
[36:48] about Constantine I want you to think
[36:49] about that now under my Administration
[36:52] we are forming a task force led by
[36:54] attorney general Pam Bondi to root out
[36:56] anti-christ bias in our government so
[37:00] now they even got a task force to root
[37:02] out anti-christian
[37:05] bias so they have all the laws in place
[37:07] which is very which seems very
[37:10] good but eventually these very people
[37:15] the very Christians that are part of all
[37:16] this in here are going to
[37:18] influence the government that's right
[37:21] and say they are people they speaking
[37:24] against
[37:26] us they are people are coming against
[37:29] Christianity they are not part of the
[37:32] organized
[37:33] church and they can be very
[37:36] dangerous because they're not
[37:38] organized they don't have
[37:41] seminaries they got people who are not
[37:44] not thought to our Bible
[37:46] colleges they can be
[37:48] Reckless they can speak about hateful
[37:51] things and jeopardize
[37:54] Christianity amen amen do you for these
[37:58] things the prophet of God opened these
[38:00] things to up we have the book the seals
[38:02] are open
[38:05] amen so during the same event Trump
[38:08] emphasized the importance of faith in
[38:10] public Life Sharing he spoke about we
[38:12] must bring back bring God back in our
[38:14] schools and public squares Faith makes
[38:17] us strong amen right so which is a good
[38:20] thing there's nothing bad about
[38:24] that but here one comment that he made
[38:28] nobody has done more for Christianity or
[38:30] for evangelicals or for religion itself
[38:33] than I
[38:34] have see when you put the eye there
[38:42] yeah Christianity has been spread
[38:45] throughout the world through the working
[38:46] of the Holy Ghost that's right amen and
[38:49] through Holy Ghost men and wom come on
[38:52] Amen yes sir no man can have a claim on
[38:56] on doing more for Christianity then the
[38:58] Holy Ghost himself hallelujah amen
[39:04] amen and you can't take the title in
[39:07] America when God's Prophet was in that
[39:09] land yes yes amen amen
[39:13] amen so all this seems very good because
[39:18] if you go and type it out what would
[39:20] happened in the in the time of
[39:23] Josiah he also took away those the
[39:26] wrongful things those Pagan things and
[39:28] all that being the Trump being the 13
[39:33] from
[39:33] JFK as past Adan gave us the
[39:37] illustration
[39:39] and Josiah being the 13 from a the 13
[39:43] King but it was that the good thing that
[39:46] was done at that time was short lived
[39:48] because the sins of his fathers were so
[39:50] bad yes the sins of America are so
[39:53] bad that that eventually
[39:57] no matter what happens no matter how
[39:59] good the time seem America is doomed she
[40:03] can't go back it was short lived if you
[40:06] look at the story of Josiah you'll see
[40:08] there he brought back the proper brought
[40:11] back the proper worship and everything
[40:13] into took out the broke down the altars
[40:15] of pagan Worship in Israel in Judah but
[40:18] he was the last after his Reign after he
[40:22] died in the Battle of Mido they went
[40:25] into
[40:26] captivity because because after his son
[40:28] took over for a very short period in the
[40:30] time remember during Josiah's time just
[40:31] when Jeremiah the prophet of prophesying
[40:34] yes and how did they go into captivity
[40:37] who took them into captivity Babylon yes
[40:39] and where will America go into spiritual
[40:42] Babylon she's getting soaked into
[40:45] spiritual
[40:46] [Applause]
[40:49] Babylon so we find that all seems good
[40:52] but God is calling us to be OD balls
[40:57] amen our life is not to be the same like
[40:59] every other human being on the
[41:01] earth amen therefore we are OD B we are
[41:06] all to the ordinary person we don't look
[41:09] at things like every other ordinary
[41:11] person amen because why we have a
[41:14] connection to where we truly come from
[41:17] we are we have another dimension open up
[41:20] to us that while people are looking at
[41:22] Earthly things we are eagles we are
[41:25] showing like eagles we are looking up
[41:27] Beyond From Another Dimension we're
[41:29] looking from above not from beneath amen
[41:32] and we begin to see things clearly
[41:34] through eagle
[41:36] eyes and we see all the things around us
[41:39] that's why in this age of great
[41:41] deception when everything seems so good
[41:43] it's not good amen we can see through
[41:46] the eyes of God that it's all filth and
[41:49] moral Decay and we can see that the God
[41:52] of this evil age this is his kingdom but
[41:54] we see that the kingdoms are trembling
[41:56] amen because God Daniel's prophecy must
[41:58] come to pass the kingdom of this Earth
[42:01] must crumble and God is ready to set up
[42:03] his kingdom but he cannot set up his
[42:05] kingdom without people amen so therefore
[42:10] when you come into connection with God
[42:12] and you come in all the reason why you
[42:13] an OD because you are from another
[42:15] kingdom amen therefore the prophet give
[42:18] us the analogy of the slave boy the
[42:22] slave
[42:23] boy his character was different to all
[42:26] the other slaves
[42:27] because why he recognized he he never
[42:30] forgot yeah might he might have been
[42:32] taken away but he knew he knew his true
[42:35] identity he knew that I'm trapped here I
[42:39] am trapped in his ptil amen he knew that
[42:42] I'm trapped here as a slave to the
[42:45] system but I know my true
[42:48] identity when the Jubilee comes when the
[42:52] Jubilee trumpet sound I will go free
[42:55] amen I won't be a slave anymore I will
[42:57] go back to to what I truly am as the
[43:00] king
[43:01] son my father is the king of the tribe
[43:04] and that's where I'm going to be but I
[43:07] don't want to lose my identity so let me
[43:10] continue conducting myself as the King's
[43:12] son amen amen even while I'm here right
[43:15] now it might be a temp just a temporary
[43:18] time but while I'm right here let me
[43:21] conduct myself as the king
[43:24] son amen so that's what made that that
[43:27] slave difference because he knew his
[43:30] true identity he knew where he come from
[43:33] and he knew where he's going to go and
[43:35] he knew that he's there for a period of
[43:37] time but the Jubilee Trumble was going
[43:39] to sound but he knew that I can't just
[43:43] go there for I'm going to be here for so
[43:46] many years a while the time I'm here if
[43:48] I conduct myself like the rest of the
[43:50] people when I go to my father's Kingdom
[43:52] how can I conduct myself now as the
[43:54] King's
[43:55] son no I got to conduct myself as a king
[43:58] son while I'm
[44:00] here so when I go into my father's
[44:02] Kingdom I will put into my position amen
[44:06] so therefore you find yourself rightly
[44:09] divided into the body of Christ where
[44:12] God has placed you because why you are
[44:14] forming this pyramid City while you on
[44:17] the earth amen then when we leave here
[44:20] we live as a PID City when we come back
[44:23] in the Millennium Reign we come back as
[44:25] the PID City amen
[44:28] amen so we find now right now currently
[44:32] they pushing for laws to enforce
[44:34] religious
[44:37] principles in
[44:38] America and we find that all seems good
[44:41] that all religious are joining
[44:44] them and
[44:48] eventually and what makes it so good is
[44:51] because they went into such moral Decay
[44:53] and just before this Administration
[44:57] he was pushing agenda that was so
[45:01] bad we know that even in the time of
[45:03] jiah he stopped that Pagan worship where
[45:06] where will they will sacrifice children
[45:09] and so forth and under this presidency
[45:11] they're talking about now stopping the
[45:13] they they speaking for pro life against
[45:15] abortion and so
[45:24] forth but we find that the second beast
[45:29] it
[45:30] must speak for the dragon it must
[45:34] exercise the power of the first Beast
[45:37] because that is the scripture Revelation
[45:39] 30 must be
[45:40] fulfilled and this will put into
[45:43] place this whole entire ecumenical
[45:48] movement with
[45:50] laws that will come again Target the
[45:52] bride of Christ and they will try to put
[45:55] pressure on the bride
[45:58] but this bride the prophet of God said
[45:59] nothing not one bomb will fall nothing
[46:02] will happen as long as this bride is on
[46:05] the earth amen but we are all this is
[46:10] happening at a time where the bride has
[46:13] come to
[46:15] maturity when she knows what to do with
[46:18] the word it's coming in a season and
[46:21] hour where the doors have been open to
[46:23] her
[46:27] Amen to the Unseen World and where all
[46:31] things are possible yes where the
[46:34] endless possibilities amen amen
[46:38] amen so they can do what they want they
[46:41] can challenge the economy right now even
[46:44] South Africa is getting scared of what's
[46:46] going to happen to the economy if you
[46:47] going to focus yourself on living under
[46:49] South Africa's
[46:51] economy yeah come on then you're going
[46:55] to be living in a time of being
[46:57] enslaved to depression and all the
[46:59] things that goes on with the people of
[47:01] the world yes sir yes sir that's right
[47:03] but we are living under our father's
[47:05] economy our father is
[47:07] Je he is our provider Amen in the time
[47:11] he said why can I
[47:13] speak and a child will cry and will get
[47:17] what they wants yeah but when a person
[47:20] is mature right in this age of maturity
[47:24] come on in the age of adoption yes sir
[47:26] amen he said now don't cry you're not a
[47:29] baby anymore when you was a Pentecostal
[47:32] baby you cried the gifts was coming to
[47:34] you the gifts of pouring into the church
[47:38] but this is not the hour to cry but it's
[47:40] the hour to
[47:42] speak yes sir amen and you only can
[47:45] speak when you recognize your true
[47:47] identity you only can speak when you
[47:49] recognize your connection to the father
[47:51] hu you only can speak when you recognize
[47:53] that all host of Heaven is backing you
[47:56] amen amen
[47:58] amen and you only can speak when you are
[48:01] certain of God amen hallelujah amen
[48:05] amen we find this the two on
[48:10] beasts that that the Revelation speaking
[48:13] about the two ons were symbolizing
[48:15] church and
[48:17] state speaking as a dragon America will
[48:21] eventually they're going to abandon the
[48:23] foundation of religious
[48:25] freedom and they'll Force laws against
[48:27] the true worshippers because they
[48:29] amalgamating with the c
[48:32] Catholicism you can see what happened
[48:34] even in the in the presidency you had
[48:36] the Jew you had the Catholic and you had
[48:38] the
[48:42] Protestant so it's the uniting of
[48:44] protestantism and Catholicism to bring
[48:47] about that one world
[48:50] religion it was being already being done
[48:53] amongst Protestants and Catholics but it
[48:55] needed the might the military might the
[48:59] political influence of the of the
[49:03] USA because she was able to give power
[49:06] to the first Beast amen
[49:09] amen so we speaking about this America
[49:12] which is the which is forming now the
[49:14] union of church and
[49:19] States so you see even in the Bible
[49:21] History teaches us that the danger of
[49:25] religious and political life
[49:27] es we saw how the church eventually had
[49:30] to go through the Dark Ages the true
[49:32] church how they had to get persecuted if
[49:35] they didn't fall under this uh organized
[49:38] religion that's why the prophet said is
[49:40] not against people but is against
[49:42] organized
[49:43] religion because Satan Works through
[49:45] organized religion he works through laws
[49:49] and system for Satan to come remember
[49:52] Satan will only come incarnate into the
[49:54] pope when the bride leaves the Earth
[49:57] amen but everything must be set for him
[49:59] to come he must have the laws put in
[50:03] place everything must be made in such a
[50:05] way not only laws must be put in place
[50:08] there must be systems in place to track
[50:11] down people that don't follow the
[50:14] system that is why you're finding all
[50:16] this artificial intelligence and all are
[50:18] coming up
[50:19] now because Satan can't is's not like
[50:22] God he's not all knowing Satan doesn't
[50:24] know everything amen he can't be in
[50:28] different places God can be God is God
[50:30] is a
[50:31] being he's by he's being by he go by
[50:34] every place because he's all knowing
[50:36] amen he's only present he's only
[50:38] omniscient and that's why he's only
[50:40] present amen amen but Satan is not like
[50:44] that Satan is going to have to use
[50:46] science he's going to have to use
[50:49] technology Amen to track down people
[50:52] who's not following the system how are
[50:54] they going to get you not to buy and
[50:56] sell you're only seeing part of it now
[50:58] when to start putting cars and so you
[51:00] only seeing the start of
[51:03] thing because they can put sanctions
[51:06] they can put Terror if they can do that
[51:08] to countries how how is going to how
[51:10] easy it is to do it to people that own
[51:12] follow the
[51:14] system thank God we're not going to be
[51:16] here for that to happen amen amen
[51:20] hallelujah but they must come these
[51:23] restrictions they must come and targets
[51:27] where all Targets are are displayed and
[51:29] shown to the bride we must become the
[51:32] target amen because we will be the
[51:35] people that exposes the system they want
[51:37] to know how do you know these things how
[51:40] does this people know the secret they
[51:41] talking about these things they a thing
[51:43] that is information that has been
[51:47] leaked but a prophet of
[51:51] God who hear from God Amen who received
[51:54] the word from the seven angels coming
[51:56] down down amen come with a message come
[52:00] with the secrets amen come to unfold all
[52:03] Satan's schemes and what is
[52:08] happening Luke 21:12 says but before all
[52:11] this they shall lay their hands on you
[52:13] and persecute
[52:16] you so there'll be censorship of the
[52:19] word the true
[52:21] word they will allow religion yes but
[52:24] they will sense they have a sense the
[52:26] ship over the true word the
[52:28] unadulterated word
[52:32] yes you think all those big
[52:35] denominations can accept you to preach
[52:38] against preachers in a pul put come
[52:41] married two or three times woman
[52:43] preaches woman bobbing their hair all
[52:45] these things you think they're going to
[52:46] allow all
[52:50] that but the bride must stand on the
[52:52] word despite the pressure she will
[52:56] remain the OD ball yes she don't need to
[52:59] be influence she don't need any position
[53:01] of man she don't need to clim climb up
[53:05] any hierarchies and be in good books
[53:07] with any man amen she has to be faithful
[53:11] and submissive to her head to a head
[53:14] amen she come under full submission she
[53:18] she has come because of love amen she's
[53:22] so much in love with him that she become
[53:25] so much like him am all of his nature
[53:28] all of his characteristics she must
[53:29] display it
[53:31] amen she loves the thing that he loves
[53:35] amen
[53:38] hallelujah thank you
[53:41] Lord so we find that this pressure that
[53:44] will come this will bring the bride into
[53:47] a full manifestation am right now she's
[53:50] come to maturity but she had to feel
[53:52] that squeeze the prophet said you know
[53:54] when everything is nice to the the
[53:56] church the church go into a lazy
[53:59] condition but when the pressure comes
[54:02] she's no longer lazy she's on a KNE
[54:04] she's praying she's getting serious with
[54:06] God she's concentrating on the things of
[54:08] God but everything is just found for you
[54:11] when everything is complacent then what
[54:13] happen the church gets
[54:16] lazy amen amen that's why the church is
[54:20] thinking they're living in the Golden
[54:22] Age they're going to that's why they
[54:23] think that's how the Catholic Church
[54:25] look at the dark in the Dark Ages the
[54:27] Catholic Church didn't look forward to
[54:28] the Millennium they thought they were in
[54:30] a
[54:31] millennium they thought they were living
[54:33] in the Golden Age they had all the
[54:36] wealth of the world accumulated the
[54:37] wealth of the world they had full
[54:39] control full political power full
[54:41] influence on the earth yes and that's
[54:44] what's happening right now there must be
[54:46] an image to the Beast
[54:49] amen so we must have the token which is
[54:51] the literal Life of
[54:53] Christ and that is what the that death
[54:56] in The Bride will sustain her amen
[55:00] Isaiah 59:19 says when the enemy shall
[55:03] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[55:06] Lord shall lift up his standard against
[55:10] you Revelation 3:10 say because thou has
[55:13] kept the word of my patience I will also
[55:16] keep thee from the hour of Temptation
[55:19] amen amen we promised amen so we find
[55:23] that this bride must be sealed and
[55:25] positioned before the pressure comes on
[55:28] that's what the word is doing now that's
[55:30] what the 54 Ministry is doing building
[55:32] up his bride into come to a position
[55:35] amen and she must be sealed by the Holy
[55:37] Ghost amen and she must have the literal
[55:40] Life of Christ the token
[55:42] displayed
[55:44] amen Matthew 24:13 says but he that
[55:48] shall enjoy unto the end the same shall
[55:51] be saved amen
[55:56] so what we got to do now we got to hold
[55:58] fast to the revealed words we got to
[56:00] hold fast to the message of the hour we
[56:03] can't compromise with any man-made
[56:05] system we can't compromise with
[56:07] political systems of this world Amen we
[56:10] got to hold fast to this precious word
[56:13] amen the title lead that's come down
[56:15] that shown us our names in the book our
[56:18] title that sh us there I am in the book
[56:22] how do you know it you see it by faith
[56:24] and faith is a revelation
[56:27] amen amen how do you see Sarah as your
[56:31] type how do you see Ruth as your type
[56:34] how do you see Rebecca as your type amen
[56:36] how do you see these things by faith
[56:39] amen
[56:42] amen that's why God when he went to
[56:45] Sarah the first thing he would have to
[56:47] do there before the body changed he said
[56:50] take out the ey and name Shall be Called
[56:53] sah he give her the H amen amen
[56:57] therefore before the body change we had
[56:59] to have the name change amen amen took
[57:03] out the eye the eye WS our own worlds
[57:08] amen every time we when sh had the eye
[57:11] she was compromising she was reasoning
[57:13] she began to think what can I do look at
[57:15] me I I am old I can't do this I have to
[57:19] give you my made to fulfill the promise
[57:22] I can I was all I I I until the edge
[57:26] came amen and then Sarah could walk now
[57:30] in a position amen
[57:34] amen thank you
[57:40] Lord we you find that when you find
[57:43] church and state come together and all
[57:45] religion organized religion come
[57:47] together you as the bride will be the
[57:50] odd ball to them they will be an odd
[57:53] ball to us and we will be an odd ball to
[57:55] them
[58:00] amen you find basically what I'm trying
[58:03] to tell you that Revelation 13 He
[58:05] prophesies about the merging of church
[58:08] and state in the last
[58:10] days it's drawing a direct parallel to
[58:13] our Constantine United the Roman Empire
[58:16] and the
[58:16] Christianity and this Union was not to
[58:19] promote true Faith but to control
[58:21] religion for political power
[58:24] amen so similarly we seeing right
[58:28] now America the second beast will
[58:30] exercise the power of the first Beast
[58:33] Rome by enforcing religious laws that
[58:35] eventually would lead to the persecution
[58:38] of the true bride because she own be
[58:40] part of that that organized
[58:45] system but you see the pattern of the
[58:47] church and state throughout
[58:54] history we find the America is imitating
[58:58] Rome but the bride she must imitate
[59:01] every other believer that that came on
[59:04] from the true Pentecostal where our
[59:07] faith have turned back to the fathers so
[59:09] if they have been if America is
[59:12] exercising the power of the first Beast
[59:15] we must exercise the faith of the
[59:17] fathers amenallah the same faith that
[59:20] started the church amen the same
[59:22] Pentecostal faith and it moved on
[59:24] further right now with because if they
[59:27] if time had been more longer if they
[59:29] wasn't going to die and face death if
[59:32] they had to live on to the ages and come
[59:34] to this age they will walk out of this
[59:36] Earth they will also change Dimensions
[59:39] but we are to come in the day when the
[59:42] title leader to come down and we are to
[59:44] receive a word and this word will make
[59:46] us leave this Dimension change Dimension
[59:50] this world will give us a body
[59:52] change amen it couldn't be done in any
[59:55] other age it had to be done in this
[59:58] age
[1:00:00] amen that's why in this day you had a
[1:00:04] prophet that one day while he's walking
[1:00:06] the Lord said now walk with me yes amen
[1:00:09] and then while walking even the deer
[1:00:11] could eat eat from his hand can come
[1:00:13] right up to him went and so come right
[1:00:15] back because why he had an experience of
[1:00:19] a body change right there if time went a
[1:00:21] little bit longer this Prophet this
[1:00:23] Earth couldn't keep this prophet he was
[1:00:25] going to leave
[1:00:26] he was going to walk out of the
[1:00:30] dimension that's how anointed this
[1:00:32] prophet of God was amen but that was
[1:00:34] just a type and Shadow showing what will
[1:00:37] happen to this bride
[1:00:40] amen because why this bride is walking
[1:00:43] under the reveal word she's separated
[1:00:45] from every organization or religion that
[1:00:47] is why we don't compromise with Creeds
[1:00:49] we don't compromise the tradition we
[1:00:52] don't compromise but say I belong to
[1:00:53] this Culture I Belong To That culture
[1:00:56] yes because what your natural birth made
[1:00:59] you to realize you of a certain skin
[1:01:01] color you of a certain origin and then
[1:01:04] it made you then you learn to e
[1:01:06] different skin religion but under the
[1:01:09] new birth there's no Creed there's no
[1:01:11] Dogma there's no black there's no white
[1:01:14] there's no yellow we all are one amen we
[1:01:17] are baptized into one body we all from
[1:01:19] one family we all have one father amen
[1:01:22] yes
[1:01:24] amen amen
[1:01:27] that is why under
[1:01:30] this true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:33] under the new
[1:01:34] birth we can come together in true peace
[1:01:38] in true Unity while the world is saying
[1:01:41] peace peace they trying to bring peace
[1:01:43] and unify that's a false peace that's a
[1:01:46] false
[1:01:47] hope prophet of God said America is
[1:01:49] doomed she might live A short time under
[1:01:52] a righteous leader like in the time of
[1:01:54] Josiah but the Doom is there the Doom is
[1:01:58] set nothing's going to change that
[1:02:00] prophet of God prophesied thus say the
[1:02:03] Lord he spoke about what will happen to
[1:02:05] America the kings of the north will get
[1:02:07] together we know what will happen right
[1:02:09] now you see them all getting together
[1:02:12] yes and we know what our Jezebel will
[1:02:15] come to end our America will come to an
[1:02:17] end we know that Russia that seven
[1:02:21] Vision must come to pass but he said not
[1:02:24] one bomb will fall till the bride until
[1:02:26] the bride leaves the Earth the bride
[1:02:28] won't be here but Russia got USA name on
[1:02:32] it it got Vatican name on
[1:02:35] it got them on the nuclear
[1:02:39] Target and that must come to pass we
[1:02:42] know what will happen to Los Angeles
[1:02:44] that is thus say the Lord amen so we can
[1:02:46] see all these
[1:02:48] things and we know that somebody must
[1:02:51] bring the Covenant because we know
[1:02:53] Vatican owns the gold the Jews own own
[1:02:56] the bond someone has to come in between
[1:02:58] and bring them together yes and the the
[1:03:01] only way you can bring the Jews in that
[1:03:02] Covenant which is we know is going to be
[1:03:04] a false Covenant because it's going to
[1:03:06] be broken the only way you can bring the
[1:03:08] Jews together is to compromise on the
[1:03:10] temple mounts yes cuz that's what they
[1:03:13] want they want that place there that's
[1:03:15] what the Jews want so someone has to
[1:03:18] bring that deal
[1:03:20] together the stage is all set now we are
[1:03:24] living in the stage where should what
[1:03:26] condition should the bride be in now
[1:03:29] what condition it should be an a
[1:03:30] rapturing condition amen it should be an
[1:03:34] condition where we not Living Earth
[1:03:35] bounds amen we are should be in a
[1:03:38] condition where you are in such maturity
[1:03:40] where nothing can stand in your way now
[1:03:43] where you have a need you know what to
[1:03:45] speak to that need how do you speak to
[1:03:48] need according to the word of
[1:03:50] God because why the
[1:03:53] characteristics the nature of Christ
[1:03:56] must be portrayed through you in and
[1:03:59] through this many membered body now let
[1:04:03] me tell you one of the character when
[1:04:04] you become so in tune and so much like
[1:04:07] Christ when you become in such an
[1:04:09] atmosphere do you know when Christ
[1:04:11] walked on the
[1:04:13] earth and the persecution came just
[1:04:16] before the persecution the persecution
[1:04:18] didn't last long right because after the
[1:04:20] crucifixion was what it was the
[1:04:23] resurrection
[1:04:26] so if the persecution comes they must
[1:04:29] know the resurrection can't be far amen
[1:04:31] the next thing to happen right now that
[1:04:34] we are waiting for we've received the
[1:04:35] shout the shout started the cycle of the
[1:04:37] Rapture amen because the Rapture is in a
[1:04:40] three-fold cycle the shout The Voice the
[1:04:43] Trump so if the shout already started
[1:04:46] and came and and call us in we will call
[1:04:49] under the
[1:04:51] shout the next event to happen is the
[1:04:54] resurrection
[1:04:56] now Jesus before the resurrection what
[1:04:58] happened you had to come the persecution
[1:05:01] you had to go to the cross and that
[1:05:03] wasn't a very long time and before Jesus
[1:05:06] goes to the Cross just before he goes to
[1:05:08] the Cross so many prophecies are being
[1:05:10] rapidly fulfilled yes
[1:05:14] amen rapidly
[1:05:17] fulfilled so right now when you see
[1:05:20] these things going to come and the
[1:05:21] persecution come the next event is the
[1:05:23] resurrection and all these prop will be
[1:05:26] rapidly
[1:05:28] fulfilled as history repeat itself
[1:05:30] scripture must repeat itself amen amen
[1:05:33] they must be types in the
[1:05:35] scripture that's how the prophet would
[1:05:37] speak about the resurrection how we're
[1:05:39] going to meet our loved one During the
[1:05:41] period like how it was in the days of
[1:05:43] Jesus during a period of 40 days he was
[1:05:45] on the earth the saint was on the earth
[1:05:47] they were seen by many Believers am it
[1:05:49] wasn't seen by other people because the
[1:05:53] Believers that to have SE that they were
[1:05:56] coming there in the
[1:05:58] dimension so just like that one of these
[1:06:01] days for a period of time we going to
[1:06:03] see Believers coming loved ones coming
[1:06:06] we're going to see them we're going to
[1:06:07] have fellowship with them we're going to
[1:06:08] really talk to them amen amen that's the
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:14] promise so we find
[1:06:16] that like when same story when sh Mish
[1:06:19] and eano when they went into captivity
[1:06:23] they refused to bow to the system they
[1:06:26] were in Babylon but they refused to bow
[1:06:28] to the system they refused to bow to
[1:06:31] Nebuchadnezzar's image we might be cheed
[1:06:34] in the system of the world but we would
[1:06:36] refuse to bow down to any system of the
[1:06:39] world
[1:06:40] Amen we will not participate in any
[1:06:44] world world
[1:06:46] religion
[1:06:47] amen amen they can bring sanctions they
[1:06:50] can bring whatever but the bride will
[1:06:53] only follow what the bridegroom thing
[1:06:57] amen yes sir anything else she won't do
[1:07:00] she won't go flirt around am with
[1:07:02] manmade religions Hallelujah because
[1:07:04] she's so much in love with him amen
[1:07:07] she's so much in love with the word
[1:07:09] she's not willing to
[1:07:11] compromise cuz if she doesn't if she's
[1:07:13] not in love with him she can't follow
[1:07:15] that word it'll be LA to her she comes
[1:07:18] because of law of love because of her
[1:07:20] love for him she follows him amen amen
[1:07:24] amen am amen yes
[1:07:28] sir so what will happen eventually they
[1:07:31] going to accuse us of bringing division
[1:07:34] amen they're going to accuse us of being
[1:07:35] rebellious against the system they're
[1:07:38] going to accuse us of being hatred
[1:07:39] bringing hatred to against Unity when
[1:07:42] they all trying to be unified and we are
[1:07:44] speak against this false Unity they
[1:07:46] going to say you all are people of
[1:07:47] hatred you don't have love God is love
[1:07:51] they
[1:07:52] misrepresent God's love amen to the
[1:07:55] World God is
[1:07:57] love but they don't know the love of God
[1:08:00] is being submissive to his word amen
[1:08:02] it's being one is loving his word yes
[1:08:05] God's love is corrective God love brings
[1:08:08] you into Union amen and you can't come
[1:08:11] into Union if you're not coming one with
[1:08:14] the word amen that's what God loved he
[1:08:17] loved you so much that he brings you
[1:08:18] into a union that's why he said depart
[1:08:21] from me workers of iniquity I know you
[1:08:24] not there was no Union amen and the
[1:08:28] Bible says Adam knew his wife and she
[1:08:30] begat there had to be a
[1:08:34] union amen but yet there's no Union they
[1:08:38] want to take the name of Christ for the
[1:08:40] pur for their own self gain and say no
[1:08:44] we don't want to come into Union with
[1:08:45] you but we will use the gifts we will
[1:08:48] use the benefits amen but we don't want
[1:08:51] to come into submission to you but
[1:08:53] marriage is about submission amen amen
[1:08:57] marriage is about coming to
[1:08:59] Fellowship
[1:09:00] marriage eventually leads to another
[1:09:03] leads to a family and how it comes to
[1:09:05] family there must be a reproduction what
[1:09:07] it is Christ being displayed again
[1:09:10] that's the end sign amen Christ is

[1:09:38] times amen amen this is the hour that we

[1:09:44] Earth but you need to stand
[1:09:47] firm and stand as one with
[1:09:49] authority recognize your true position
[1:09:52] recognize your true potentials
[1:09:55] you're not the tail you are the head

[1:10:13] one with
[1:10:14] authority you don't speak as one being
[1:10:16] puffed up but one with authority amen
[1:10:20] knowing that when you speak what you say
[1:10:22] must come to pass amen because because
[1:10:25] he said whatsoever should ask my father
[1:10:27] in my name I that he shall give unto you
[1:10:31] if you ask anything in my name it shall
[1:10:32] be given unto
[1:10:37] you amen
[1:10:40] some
[1:10:53] CL can me go to the
[1:11:00] he says he has to be for that history is
[1:11:03] repeating itself from the time of a
[1:11:05] Israel's history under a is happening
[1:11:07] right here in America when the prophet
[1:11:10] of Malachi appear now we know there was
[1:11:13] in the time of JFK he spoke about
[1:11:17] that and he says I do not think that Mr
[1:11:20] Kennedy will have much effect now
[1:11:24] because he'll make a wonderful president
[1:11:26] in order to bring in the others to get a
[1:11:29] scene set just like they have in England
[1:11:32] like they did in Mexico like they did
[1:11:34] everywhere else like
[1:11:37] that then in the
[1:11:40] message on the pan Church age he
[1:11:43] say Constantine was all always
[1:11:47] considered and is by the people today
[1:11:49] the origination of the Knight of
[1:11:51] Columbus now the one that gave that
[1:11:54] Bloody o but Constantine I say this with
[1:11:57] reverence and respect to my way of
[1:11:59] reading it out of History never was
[1:12:03] converted now he dreamed a dream one
[1:12:09] night he SE a cross and said that by
[1:12:13] this he would win the battle and because
[1:12:16] that he had promised relief to the
[1:12:18] Christian that he would be a Christian
[1:12:20] if they would pray for him to win that
[1:12:22] battle and I stood by the bridge there
[1:12:25] and on the other side of bridge sleeping
[1:12:26] dreamed this dream and woke up and
[1:12:29] painted a white cross on the shield of
[1:12:30] East and all of his Warrior and there
[1:12:33] where formed the Knight of Columbus
[1:12:35] which is under the Roman Catholic
[1:12:39] domination domination but he never did
[1:12:42] one thing religious the only thing that
[1:12:44] he ever did that wrote in history as
[1:12:48] I've ever seen was he put a cross on top
[1:12:51] of St Sophia's church but he was a
[1:12:54] politician
[1:12:56] and he and when he was the emperor of
[1:12:58] Rome at that time he and his Pagan
[1:13:00] priests together Consolidated and
[1:13:03] brought in the lukan church called
[1:13:07] nicolan at that time Christianity which
[1:13:11] was leaning toward priesthood and wanted
[1:13:13] it in their church that we have taken in
[1:13:17] future studies of the Church of Ephesus
[1:13:18] and so forth and of SMA those nicolan
[1:13:22] now
[1:13:23] nicolan has become not de like it was
[1:13:26] back at the beginning here but yeah it's
[1:13:28] a Doctrine yeah it was deed they were
[1:13:31] just trying to get it in but over here
[1:13:33] in the third age it became doct high
[1:13:35] priest Great Fellowship call them popes
[1:13:37] yet now but they were called like Arch
[1:13:40] Bishop great fellows you know we now and
[1:13:43] the doctrine was it was formal they were
[1:13:46] getting away from the spiritful Holy
[1:13:49] Ghost L Church they let them go off in
[1:13:53] the minority and call them
[1:13:57] Heretics because they wouldn't agree
[1:13:59] with them to have their great
[1:14:01] denomination so who's in the minority
[1:14:03] now the bride is always in a
[1:14:06] minority but the church wanted to stay
[1:14:09] free under jurisdiction under the power
[1:14:12] of the Holy Spirit as Christ has
[1:14:14] promised them it be with them and that
[1:14:17] was their King oh their King the true
[1:14:21] church has never changed his
[1:14:24] attitude not to be ruled by some b or I
[1:14:29] don't know what you call them out there
[1:14:31] Cardinals and Bishops and popes
[1:14:32] infallible one we believe there one
[1:14:35] infallible one he is our King he is
[1:14:38] Jesus Christ who us now in the form of
[1:14:40] the Holy Spirit God in us living amongst
[1:14:43] us leading us and guiding us into the
[1:14:46] Waters of life making himself known
[1:14:49] showing as he did among those early
[1:14:51] Saints and martys that he was the living
[1:14:54] He he was the Lord God of creation
[1:14:56] Healing The Sick raising the Dead
[1:14:59] showing Visions casting out devil
[1:15:03] amen now he
[1:15:05] says in the Titan Church age paragraph
[1:15:08] 63 he says and now look at this watch
[1:15:10] this strategy and watch how the Bible
[1:15:13] confirms it God hundreds and hundreds of
[1:15:16] years before he taken place and constant
[1:15:19] and use the same strategy God said you
[1:15:22] that a
[1:15:23] abused I want you to see history
[1:15:26] repeating itself now Constantine seen a
[1:15:29] great part of this people where the
[1:15:32] these nians Christians some of them were
[1:15:35] called Heretics that's the Pentecostals
[1:15:38] they were Heretics and O rollers and
[1:15:39] what more they there's where your real
[1:15:42] signs and wonders laid but the church
[1:15:45] natural then was coming on up to the
[1:15:48] organization what did he do Constantine
[1:15:52] played a smart part he goes over there
[1:15:55] get his Pagan friends and get his
[1:15:57] Christian friends and unites the church
[1:16:00] together amen brought paganism into
[1:16:04] Christianity Christianity and paganism
[1:16:06] married into the pagamos church now what
[1:16:10] did he say over here to this tonight
[1:16:12] that same thing that aab did aab to
[1:16:16] strengthen his kingdom married
[1:16:18] Jezebel this idolatrous to strengthen
[1:16:22] his kingdom to get more strength into
[1:16:24] Israel
[1:16:32] he say when aab married Jezebel for
[1:16:34] political reason he sold his Birthright
[1:16:38] you join up with an organization and you
[1:16:40] sell your Birthright brother whether you
[1:16:42] want to believe it or not every
[1:16:44] Protestant group that ever came out and
[1:16:47] that went back sold their birth right
[1:16:51] and when you sell your birth right just
[1:16:53] like Esau you can cry and repent all you
[1:16:56] want but it w't do you any good yes
[1:17:00] there is only one thing you can do and
[1:17:02] that is come out of her my people and
[1:17:06] stop partaking of a sin now if you don't
[1:17:09] think I'm right just answer this one
[1:17:11] question can any man living tell me what
[1:17:14] church or what move of God ever had
[1:17:18] Revival and came back after she went
[1:17:20] into
[1:17:21] organization and became a denomination
[1:17:25] read your hisory you find you can find
[1:17:28] not even
[1:17:32] one now in the true Easter se he said
[1:17:35] and how as people sit there and brought
[1:17:38] this thing in just because of politics
[1:17:41] how I don't understand it but here we
[1:17:43] are right here on this Easter morning
[1:17:46] and the very thing the very reason we
[1:17:48] come to this country become American was
[1:17:50] for freedom of religion against that
[1:17:53] jelly Bell System and we turn right back
[1:17:57] around and elected on the platform of
[1:18:00] there in the White House the very thing
[1:18:02] that we come out here to be freed from
[1:18:05] it's a tremendous condition that we
[1:18:06] living in now you know that this church
[1:18:09] spiritual because it's sold out
[1:18:14] amen leave
[1:18:18] that one more quote here in a super sign
[1:18:21] he says let me make a prediction I'm not
[1:18:24] prophesying I'm predicting I predict
[1:18:26] that in the next few years that all
[1:18:28] organization religion will be forced to
[1:18:31] take a stand and they will have a union
[1:18:33] of churches and a great boycott will
[1:18:36] follow this Union of churches all
[1:18:38] denominations will be forced into it all
[1:18:40] of them if they don't they will be a
[1:18:43] horrible boycott nearly every one of
[1:18:46] them today has not knowingly join the
[1:18:49] World Council of
[1:18:51] churches selling their Bird right
[1:18:54] protest
[1:18:55] Brothers with the mother Catholic of
[1:18:57] Rome they'll do that you know and the
[1:19:00] Bible said that the tears will be bound
[1:19:03] bundle first they are bundling all in
[1:19:06] one great group the Bible said they will
[1:19:08] make an image unto the Beast yeah I
[1:19:11] believe it'll come to pass that shortly
[1:19:14] that if people do not join some
[1:19:15] organization some church go in their
[1:19:19] doors will be
[1:19:20] closed this nation has always Ted Israel
[1:19:23] Israel we find out come into another
[1:19:25] land took the occupants slay them run
[1:19:28] them out push them back and occupy the
[1:19:30] land just as we did the Indians then God
[1:19:34] gave them that land God gave us this
[1:19:36] land notice that what take place they
[1:19:40] are great men in them days Joshua a king
[1:19:43] they had David they had Solomon great
[1:19:45] men but finally it worked around till
[1:19:48] they got a renegade on the platform aab
[1:19:50] a lwam Believer it wasn't so much aab
[1:19:54] but it was that wife behind him Jezebel
[1:19:57] of another race of another class not an
[1:20:00] Israelite she was an ethen and Idol
[1:20:02] worshiper she was the one who done the
[1:20:05] Dirty Work she told a what to do and we
[1:20:08] have worked around in the same way and
[1:20:10] we've had a Washington a Lincoln after
[1:20:13] we pushed the Indians back and took
[1:20:15] their ground but what we but what have
[1:20:18] we done to politics we work the very
[1:20:21] thing in what we come over here for
[1:20:23] freedom from that's exactly right a
[1:20:26] jezebel arious and a Jacqueline married
[1:20:30] twice before living with a third hband
[1:20:33] living in there now and yet the people
[1:20:36] go for it blinded in their eyes and
[1:20:39] there it
[1:20:40] is you just watch we're going to reap
[1:20:43] what we s she's at the end I prophesied
[1:20:46] in 1956 when buly Graham would return
[1:20:49] and I said that Tommy Osborne would
[1:20:51] return and America would receive a last
[1:20:54] call several years ago I it predicted
[1:20:57] exactly the magnet line line exactly
[1:21:01] what would taken what would take place
[1:21:03] exactly K the what would take place and
[1:21:06] of this there would be a Catholic
[1:21:07] President ruling here and what it would
[1:21:10] be and just two more things left from
[1:21:13] seven things that he told me to happen
[1:21:16] perfectly that's right it's on yellow
[1:21:18] paper we at the end
[1:21:20] time amen amen so you see where we at
[1:21:24] now yeah
[1:21:27] this last
[1:21:29] quote he
[1:21:32] says but you remember when it went down
[1:21:35] and the grain begin to ripen that you
[1:21:38] find before the grain can ripen
[1:21:41] everything in the stock has to be
[1:21:43] dead so we find all denomination to be
[1:21:46] dried
[1:21:46] up amen they had the Revival they had
[1:21:50] the Ealing campaigns around the world
[1:21:51] but it all had to be DED up it all had
[1:21:54] to be did before now the grain could
[1:21:56] ripen then we had the process of the
