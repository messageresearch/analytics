[2:53] to see the supernatural of God
[2:57] amen there was a prophecy go over the
[2:59] church that says this will be the most
[3:00] Supernatural year for the church
[3:02] amen so yesterday you all know that we
[3:05] had a service and our pastor Eugene
[3:07] Ashley preached and he preached on Grace
[3:08] and he was a blessed service amen we
[3:10] were all rejoicing after the service and
[3:13] I happened to meet Pastor Samuel at
[3:15] lunch and it was not even arranged it
[3:17] was all just happening I was on my way
[3:20] to pick up uh Pastor Eugene and then
[3:22] brother denzo formed he said don't worry
[3:23] I'll bring him and come and can we just

[3:48] we probably never have got a chance with
[3:50] the amount of people that would have
[3:52] wanted him to come in that one week
[3:54] amen so he came to the service
[3:57] and he said as long as I'm not preaching
[3:59] I'll come and enjoy the word
[4:01] but there was something about the
[4:02] preaching of the word that can revive a
[4:05] soul even a tired Soul amen yes yes so I
[4:09] am guilty many times of bringing people
[4:11] out of retirement and also bringing
[4:13] people out of the holidays

[13:07] the week of Exodus chapter 14. amen
[13:10] hallelujah

[13:15] [Music]
[13:19] I believe the story downloads
[13:25] the Bible says
[13:28] and when Pharaoh Junior
[13:30] the children of Israel lifted up their
[13:32] eyes
[13:33] and behold
[13:35] Egyptians matched after them they were
[13:38] so afraid in the children of Israel
[13:40] Pride unto the Lord
[13:42] and they said unto Moses because there
[13:45] were no graves in Egypt thou has taken
[13:48] us to die in the wilderness wherefore
[13:50] has thou dealt thus with us to carry us
[13:53] from out of Egypt is this not the way
[13:57] that we did tell thee in Egypt saying
[13:59] let us alone and we may serve the
[14:02] Egyptians for it had been better for us
[14:04] to serve Egyptians than that we should
[14:07] die in the wilderness this is just at
[14:09] the beginning of the Exodus amen and
[14:12] this is the people under the Moses
[14:13] commission let's come to the Book of
[14:15] Joshua chapter one amen
[14:18] Joshua Festival
[14:25] Joshua chapter
[14:34] so we see when it comes to Joshua
[14:36] chapter 1
[14:38] .
[14:39] before it gives them instructions
[14:42] in from verse 10 downwards so we shall
[14:45] read the reaction amen the people as he
[14:49] instructed by Joshua let's hear the
[14:52] reaction in verse 16.
[14:55] and it says and they answered Joshua
[14:58] saying all that thou has commanded us we
[15:01] will do amen and without sovereign
[15:14] Grace that has brought us together
[15:19] for it is not by our ability or our will
[15:22] the father We Believe before ordained it
[15:25] before the foundation
[15:27] we could meet in this manner in this
[15:29] mission in this particular geographic
[15:31] location yeah at this particular time
[15:34] amen we pray as your weight has been
[15:36] read speak to us touch Our Lives yes
[15:39] draw us closer to yourself Amen in the
[15:42] name of our Lord Our Savior Jesus Christ
[15:44] amen
[15:46] you may be seated by the same systems
[15:48] Amen Let me just take this moment to
[15:52] appreciate it by the way
[16:00] s that are taking you to stay before you
[16:02] say a few words
[16:04] it was not my intention
[16:06] I
[16:07] I had turned down
[16:10] [Music]
[16:12] invitation to preach elsewhere because I
[16:15] was just dreaming a lot of fatigue
[16:17] things just have been out and came to
[16:20] death and just arrested
[16:23] yesterday after we left
[16:26] signal you should preached for us and
[16:29] then as we left with Pastor Davidson
[16:34] on the way just after
[16:37] leaving the gate here
[16:39] I just began to become feel very
[16:41] restless
[16:44] [Music]
[16:46] I should come back
[16:51] I was aware that if I did not disclose
[16:55] it because foreign
[16:57] [Music]
[17:10] [Music]
[17:22] [Music]
[17:24] my favorite Services is when I'm sitting
[17:26] down like last night when Pastor Eugene
[17:29] was ministering and I can say Amen to
[17:33] someone or maybe just sneaking in a
[17:35] series of animals and hide somewhere
[17:37] there and and just enjoy myself yeah I
[17:40] always love that I mean because you know
[17:44] you sit there you feed a soul with
[17:46] spiritual food
[17:48] and also the Bible admonishes as it
[17:51] tells us do unto others what you want
[17:53] them to give them so if I don't
[17:55] preachers
[17:57] you're also sit down so and at one way
[18:02] so maybe you have to make him to owe us
[18:05] amen
[18:07] God bless you for such a lovely
[18:10] wonderful atmosphere amen which we enjoy
[18:13] it it made us future the weight last
[18:15] night amen you know you can go to places
[18:17] you can preach
[18:19] but there's sometimes services or places
[18:22] or churches where within five minutes
[18:24] you're asking for water you're not
[18:27] thirsty you're coughing but you're not
[18:29] suffering from flu and Corona and then
[18:32] you feel like there's arrows that
[18:34] deflate back that which you are trying
[18:36] to say until you feel like oh God let
[18:40] never be back to me bring me back to
[18:42] this place but it was so wonderful last
[18:44] night
[18:47] just to enjoy that wonderful Divine
[18:50] Supernatural atmosphere and a testimony
[18:53] uh that a brother was reciting and one
[18:56] that the pastor also hinted on very
[18:58] touching testimonies which really uh
[19:02] continually it it kind of uh uh
[19:06] helps us to realize that the things we
[19:10] believe are real it's not imagination
[19:12] amen it's things that are tangible right
[19:15] so
[19:17] tonight let's just speak a little bit on
[19:21] um why did The Exodus take so long
[19:27] and we want to look at Inhibitors
[19:30] attitude wonderful in this context so we
[19:35] find that
[19:37] the journey brother Brahman says from
[19:39] Egypt to Israel okay
[19:43] it was supposed to take
[19:45] one and a half
[19:47] hours if it was by car so that's roughly
[19:51] 150 kilometers yeah
[19:54] then he says the same Journey
[19:57] by foot was supposed to be three days
[20:03] then we realize that
[20:05] this journey which was supposed to be
[20:07] one and a half which was supposed to be
[20:09] three days
[20:10] it became 40 years
[20:12] now which translates to 14
[20:17] 000 days
[20:18] 14 400 Days
[20:22] and in hours
[20:24] the journey which was supposed to be one
[20:25] and a half hours if it was by automobile
[20:28] if it was our times
[20:30] it took about
[20:32] 345
[20:34] 600 hours close to half a million hours
[20:38] normal
[20:40] why did Jenny so short become so long
[20:44] was it the fault of God
[20:48] was it that the land was not real
[20:51] was said that was in the front of
[20:53] pharaoh was he was he obstructing them
[20:55] from entering into the promise
[20:58] was it
[21:00] fault
[21:01] [Music]
[21:03] was it too strong for Israel
[21:05] what was it the inheritance problem
[21:09] maybe that's what we need to look at
[21:11] yeah
[21:15] and established that the God who
[21:17] promised them this wonderful land was
[21:19] here he was all powerful and he already
[21:23] declared it's theirs so it cannot be his
[21:26] fault yes amen when it comes to Pharaoh
[21:30] Pharaoh and his army were totally
[21:32] defeated amen
[21:35] and there were not an obstruction for
[21:37] Israel to enter into the life
[21:41] was it the Canaanites that extended them
[21:44] from taking their place in the land of
[21:46] promise
[21:47] certainly not the Canaanites but the
[21:49] Bible had said that their defense had
[21:52] already patted from them
[21:55] so it leaves just one group of kids
[22:05] let's realize brothers and sisters that
[22:08] this inheritance this land was a real
[22:10] place
[22:12] it was not something theoretical it was
[22:14] not something which was imaginary
[22:19] amen
[22:21] hallelujah it's not just a claim it was
[22:23] a reality amen
[22:28] you know when you move around the cities
[22:31] there's areas where you find a sign
[22:34] preaching the way of a dog and there's
[22:36] this phase of a scaring Pitbull
[22:43] whatever they could
[22:45] the picture itself was scared you're
[22:47] going to knock anything
[22:48] and the weights rain Terror in your
[22:52] heart yeah
[22:54] you go inside some of these homes
[22:58] [Music]
[22:59] you will find that
[23:02] it's not dark
[23:07] amen no mouse amen maybe just a few
[23:11] cockroaches in the kitchen so they claim
[23:14] outside yes in the reality inside are
[23:18] different yeah amen
[23:20] promise
[23:26] was not just a dream yeah it was
[23:29] something real important yeah
[23:32] man I think of a little experience we
[23:36] used to have as little children I
[23:37] believe in the mid 70s
[23:39] you know rural home where we grew up
[23:42] there was this neighbor in the for in
[23:44] the bush in the farming area he had a
[23:47] lot of old scrap cars which were no
[23:51] longer functional and no wheels they'll
[23:53] be suspended on logs and on Stones so we
[23:57] could go there and chill and sneak out
[23:58] because they were not inside the yard
[24:00] they were just outside uh in the around
[24:02] the trees and so on so we got there we
[24:05] begin to say each one chooses his car we
[24:08] are going to do car racing and then you
[24:11] know you start sitting on an imaginary
[24:12] chair
[24:13] and then you start an imaginary Engine
[24:16] with your mouth you say
[24:19] and then from there you begin to rev
[24:23] this imaginary car and you're holding a
[24:25] steering that doesn't
[24:26] yeah and then you start saying I'm
[24:28] overtaking I'm overtaking I have won the
[24:31] race but you know after all the drama
[24:33] and all the noise you discover that it's
[24:36] nothing which is real yeah yeah there's
[24:38] just a claim it's not tangible yeah it's
[24:41] all imagination Because by the end of
[24:43] all the noise and the trauma and
[24:45] everything you are still at the same
[24:47] place where you were here where you
[24:48] began to play with your friends yeah but
[24:50] my brother my sister I want to assure
[24:52] you tonight that the land of promise was
[24:55] real amen the land was tangible then the
[24:58] Bible tells us we have an inheritance
[25:02] we have anything
[25:04] any general inheritance and this
[25:07] inheritance is real to us amen is
[25:09] touchable amen just like faith is not
[25:12] imagination faith is something touchable
[25:15] life is something real yeah
[25:19] so we see brothers and sisters that
[25:21] these people are told that there's a man
[25:24] amen that belongs to them and it's an
[25:27] inheritance yes in no inheritance is
[25:29] something you have not went to yeah
[25:31] yeah something you did not went for but
[25:33] it's given to you for free
[25:36] but you can accept inheritance
[25:39] or refuse the Heritage the choice is
[25:42] always in Your Hair amen
[25:44] amen but we thank God we have any
[25:46] channel inheritance amen amen now let's
[25:49] realize that God had already given uh
[25:52] Abraham the boundaries of the land that
[25:54] he gave him
[25:57] it was all detailed and described in the
[26:01] Book of Genesis and we find that you
[26:04] guys told the River on the south is one
[26:06] border below that is Egypt and then he
[26:08] was told uh Another River in phrase but
[26:12] you must not Israel was told when you
[26:14] get to that man of Promise don't go
[26:16] beyond the Great River new friends
[26:17] because Beyond inference is is Babylon
[26:20] it's confusion It's ability I tell you
[26:23] my brother my sister at pays to stay
[26:24] within the boundaries
[26:27] inheritance
[26:29] landmarks it head boundaries and as long
[26:32] as a Jew was inside the boundaries of
[26:35] this land yeah he was he was undefeated
[26:37] yes
[26:58] because it's your place
[27:02] and you have advantage against the enemy
[27:05] because it's why you really belong and
[27:08] when you are there your power and
[27:10] jurisdiction and Authority ah man you
[27:13] cannot be shaken by anything else amen
[27:16] absolutely as long as you know this is
[27:18] my inheritance
[27:19] and the brothers of what belongs to me
[27:23] so that's why if we we are going back to
[27:26] the city of caporali Botswana maybe from
[27:29] Johannesburg if we are driving and then
[27:31] we see a police officer stops us but
[27:34] he's waiting for another police uniform
[27:36] uh we are not obligated to stop yes
[27:40] because
[27:43] amen if we stop we might just stop out
[27:46] of courtesy out of battery
[27:48] to this part to him to say please do you
[27:51] know geography yeah
[27:56] you're outside yeah yes outside a place
[28:01] of your Authority amen you are outside
[28:03] your boundaries you're outside your
[28:07] jurisdiction
[28:08] please just pick your things stop
[28:10] shaming Us return back to
[28:12] [Music]
[28:14] You Know The Enemy the devil the amount
[28:17] your roadblock in your own inheritance
[28:20] where you really belong yeah you're not
[28:23] obligated to stop you should be able to
[28:25] tell you something to say I'm not
[28:27] talking about anything
[28:29] I have power I have jurisdiction I have
[28:32] authority to extend this promise
[28:36] it must have been the name of the Lord
[28:40] of Israel is in just a little background
[28:45] we are told by the Bible in The Book of
[28:48] Leviticus 18.
[28:50] that nothing that defiles was to be
[28:53] brought into this land amen amen right
[28:57] because the god of the land you
[29:00] had his principles of how the people
[29:02] that live in this land should believe
[29:06] amen and the Bible says those that
[29:09] defile it
[29:11] this land vomits its inhabitants out
[29:15] so the land was a vomiting land amen
[29:19] does that Define them it it vomited them
[29:22] out
[29:24] think of when Israel defiled This Land
[29:27] part of the Kingdom of Israel was
[29:30] vomited to Assyria and another part
[29:33] later
[29:33] [Music]
[29:35] yeah
[29:36] they rejected Jesus defiled the lamb yes
[29:39] and the land vomited them to All Nations
[29:42] [Music]
[29:43] doesn't don't you think of the message
[29:45] of the hour
[29:47] those that try to Define it yes
[29:52] amen
[29:54] amen
[29:56] amen so my brother my sister
[29:59] let me read this quotation as we begin
[30:01] Brother program says God never did deal
[30:04] with Israel till she cut to her Homeland
[30:07] hear me thus say of the Lord God will
[30:10] not deal with his church till she comes
[30:12] back to her amen yes the message of the
[30:15] Hour come back to the original
[30:18] amen
[30:20] get away from your Methodist Baptist
[30:23] Presbyterian in your Pentecostal
[30:25] assemblies Oneness threeness and
[30:27] fiveness whatever it may be whatever it
[30:30] is Church of God Nazarene Pilgrim
[30:32] Holiness Church of Christ all Antichrist
[30:35] movements
[30:37] amen
[30:39] thank you
[30:42] men in every one of them godly people in
[30:45] every one of the movements but the
[30:47] organization in itself is not of God and
[30:50] God will never bless it he has never
[30:52] done it so now realize he says the
[30:54] Homeland for the church for the bride is
[30:57] the message
[31:02] Gabriel's instructions to Daniel
[31:05] that is amazing thing visible unit of
[31:07] the bride of Christ
[31:09] amen decides these words says the
[31:13] pilgrim fathers were thankful for the
[31:15] Newfound way of life amen being
[31:18] separated from the old English
[31:19] denominations and treats
[31:22] they could marry the new anointed word
[31:24] for their age
[31:26] that's right the new anointed worked for
[31:28] their age for their day
[31:32] so weak so can we be thankful
[31:35] experience like Abraham separated from
[31:39] the Saints of the world
[31:40] all of our Associates
[31:43] Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated
[31:46] us from all that religions
[31:50] I'm speaking Across the Nation all the
[31:53] treats and to what so you're separated
[31:56] us from dead kids you're separated us
[31:58] from denominations we have been called
[32:00] out of the Babylon amen amen but God
[32:02] cannot call you from something and leave
[32:04] you hanging inside he calls you out of
[32:07] something and places
[32:11] so he called us to work separated us and
[32:14] opened to us and you land and you
[32:18] message for this day so in this context
[32:21] of the invisible Union brother is bring
[32:24] it to our attention that the new land
[32:27] whereby we are separated unto is the
[32:30] message Hallelujah the new message of
[32:32] this day
[32:35] so brothers and sisters
[32:40] Israel was a nation in Exodus and the
[32:44] parallel between two there's a lot that
[32:46] we can learn from amen now let's realize
[32:49] that brothers and sisters when God
[32:51] commissioned Moses Moses commission was
[32:53] to take them out of Egypt but Joshua's
[32:55] commissioned us to take them yeah yeah
[32:57] amen amen look at this Philip brought
[33:01] Nathaniel to Jesus Jesus Took Philippine
[33:10] [Music]
[33:15] to him
[33:17] when he saw Nathaniel coming to him but
[33:20] yet they were walking side by side we
[33:21] see him but the Bible specifies only
[33:24] Nathaniel but remember that Philip had
[33:26] already believed he had already
[33:28] extracted
[33:30] Christine and then feel to connect him
[33:36] I believe that's what the pastor was
[33:38] saying last night you said the world can
[33:41] work on a person and say goodness
[33:46] Jesus
[33:50] Peter to Jesus Jesus took him in in one
[33:53] account of the Gospel does somebody tell
[33:55] woman testify to her people and Jesus
[33:59] brought them into the gospel by speaking
[34:01] to them amen when we bring people to
[34:04] Jesus Jesus Takes them into today
[34:12] [Applause]
[34:15] he places is
[34:22] [Applause]
[34:32] amen
[34:37] now watch this brothers and sisters
[34:41] there's always been better for land
[34:43] because the first war in the Bible one
[34:45] of the festivals on land I mean on Earth
[34:48] was a battle a quarter Overland
[34:51] ibraham's Shepherds visitors yeah let's
[34:54] check but it was crazy land uh because
[34:57] the land cannot be expanded
[35:00] it's finite you know it's limited like
[35:02] that and then you know you have to push
[35:05] someone because you can't extend the
[35:07] land and then
[35:09] the lead cannot be relocated if you have
[35:12] a bad neighbor no matter how much you
[35:14] groan and cry as they say you can choose
[35:17] a wife you can choose a car you can
[35:19] choose a job but the country is a
[35:21] neighbor yeah right you somehow find
[35:23] yourself next time neighbor if it's a
[35:25] dreadful neighbor he's a dreadful
[35:27] neighbor and because land cannot be
[35:29] relocated you cannot get angry and uh uh
[35:33] kind of put your car I mean your house
[35:37] with a a giant JCP or excavator and
[35:41] relocate it to another place the best is
[35:44] you might sell the property go and live
[35:46] somewhere else but you cannot believe
[35:47] okay that particular specific piece of
[35:49] property so that's why the land is good
[35:53] always a source of conflict and War
[35:55] because it cannot be expanded and it
[35:57] cannot be relocated and my brother my
[35:59] sister if we take it in the context of
[36:02] the message you cannot start explaining
[36:04] over stretching the message and we say
[36:06] things that really are no longer
[36:08] scripture amen we cannot end we cannot
[36:11] subtract the word Remains the Same
[36:13] forever because Jesus Christ is the same
[36:16] yesterday today and forever amen that's
[36:19] why we see that uh the issue of shortage
[36:21] of land throughout history has been a
[36:23] cause of migration at times and we see
[36:26] that sometimes people migrate because
[36:27] they want a better pastures and when we
[36:30] thank God that the Lord leads us to
[36:32] Green Pastures besides amen amen they
[36:35] want better water but we have Fountain
[36:38] of Living Water planted by the water
[36:40] they look for a better fertile land to
[36:43] bring forth fruit amen but the world has
[36:45] been planted in our soul which is the
[36:48] good ground for the way to manifest they
[36:50] want maybe better grazing land like a
[36:52] world and fruits and grapes of the land
[36:55] but you know in The Inheritance we have
[36:57] everything we have need of is there they
[37:00] are looking for resources maybe better
[37:01] resources minerals and sources of
[37:04] resources for our needs but I tell you
[37:06] what brother my sister in the kingdom of
[37:08] God we don't have we don't need anything
[37:10] outside it amen
[37:13] amen everything we have need of is
[37:16] already inside
[37:18] again of The Incorruptible seed of God
[37:20] brother says all we have needed for this
[37:23] journey is already inside you if you're
[37:25] good on your body
[37:28] amen so let's realize that if you have a
[37:32] piece of land that has got this uh
[37:34] boundaries and so on everything inside
[37:37] it belongs to you amen all the minerals
[37:40] all the mountains all the rivers
[37:43] everything inside there belongs to you
[37:45] but you have got to know your
[37:47] inheritance
[37:50] you need to survey your inheritance you
[37:53] need to properly know your landmarks you
[37:56] need to properly know all the boundaries
[37:59] if you don't know the enemy will come
[38:01] and cut a piece of your land then you
[38:03] just keep on saying impossible 15
[38:06] helpers now if it's like it's 14 what is
[38:08] it or you might not even notice anything
[38:10] because you don't know you learn much
[38:14] ah man blessed be the name of the Lord
[38:16] and my brother my sister let's meditate
[38:18] upon the word of God day and night so
[38:20] that we can know the length and bread of
[38:22] our Heaven yes sir so that we can know
[38:25] what belongs to us so that if the enemy
[38:27] tries to part of what belongs to you
[38:29] then
[38:30] my Divine Healing from you and take away
[38:32] Joy from you
[38:35] [Applause]
[38:36] try your smile Jesus Christ happiness is
[38:39] not salvation is mine you can stand your
[38:43] ground because you know you know your
[38:45] inheritance the breath and the land of
[38:46] inheritance and my brother my sister we
[38:50] realize that
[38:53] even denominational people they
[38:55] sometimes feel like something is not
[38:57] right among them
[38:58] and then unfortunately the loudestian
[39:01] age it's um
[39:04] it talks about their blind and they are
[39:06] naked and Ratchet and miserable and
[39:10] programs is the scaling things and they
[39:12] don't know it since that part is very
[39:15] scary and now think of someone who is
[39:18] blind and naked and wretched and
[39:21] miserable in the ages don't say attack
[39:23] each so blind men in darkness trying to
[39:26] survey and not identify the landmarks
[39:30] [Music]
[39:36] and it goes like I found it and it's not
[39:40] a new movement he calls it back to God
[39:41] Ministries
[39:43] then another one out of this one feels
[39:46] like things are not right he's a blind
[39:48] man in darkness he also begins to try to
[39:50] identify the real thing and then he says
[39:52] I found it aha I found it I found it
[39:55] then it calls it maybe Spirit everybody
[39:58] see your Christ them I see whatsoever
[39:59] you know Chinese are certain of names
[40:01] until the names some of them are
[40:04] ridiculous some of them are very strange
[40:06] sometimes even hear of a helicopter
[40:08] Church of God it's just Choice assaulted
[40:10] it's just explaining it's just blind
[40:12] people in darkness right or identify the
[40:15] original landmarks but my brother my
[40:17] sister you don't need a blind person to
[40:19] do something yeah yeah you need someone
[40:22] with technical knowledge you need
[40:24] someone with eyesight someone with the
[40:27] right equipment and thank God through
[40:30] all the church ages we see that
[40:32] denominations fired a lot of rubble of
[40:35] our inheritance until we lost track of 1
[40:38] million
[40:53] knew exactly how to use this equipment
[40:55] and by the grace of God he has located
[41:03] because all the mystery of God is
[41:06] finished and completed by this delighted
[41:09] amen until now all the brothers and the
[41:13] landmark civil inheritance has come to
[41:15] blame you amen
[41:20] that's why my brother my sister and the
[41:22] hour we live in we have no excuse we
[41:25] should not be we should not say to God
[41:27] in our time because all the mystery of
[41:29] God has been blessed and brought to our
[41:31] attention in terms of the revelation of
[41:33] the word
[41:34] if they don't understand something in
[41:36] the message don't say it's not open
[41:39] just say Brethren ah TV is not yet open
[41:43] to me it's not yet revealed
[41:47] there you go if the seventh angel
[41:49] finishes
[41:54] I think this other seal is not open amen
[41:58] because then the question becomes
[42:01] um
[42:02] brother random did not just preach the
[42:04] Seven Seals he preached The Refuge yes
[42:10] but the revelation of the Seven Seas so
[42:14] if I don't understand any of them I
[42:16] should not Proclaim it's not open as you
[42:19] just said to me
[42:21] I remember God in his time he shall
[42:24] reveal it to you but to Elijah all the
[42:27] entire mystery has been opened yeah
[42:29] ah man God help us
[42:33] hey amen so this land that is our
[42:37] inheritance let's quickly rush to me the
[42:40] people under Moses Commission
[42:42] now we see that under Moses they just
[42:44] thought the Excellence
[42:46] with mammary
[42:49] this is what makes the land which is so
[42:52] so near becomes so far yes
[42:56] [Music]
[42:59] they expecting
[43:00] Virginia
[43:02] with memory
[43:04] and complaining
[43:07] instead of trusting God and brother
[43:10] Brahman says God let them through that
[43:12] root so that he could show the reason my
[43:15] teeth this is a place
[43:18] where my brother my sister
[43:20] god with his mighty hand open the Red
[43:22] Sea amen and the Bible says he made the
[43:25] waters the world unto the water oh yes
[43:29] now I don't know anyone who is a water
[43:31] engineer here who can make it them where
[43:34] the water becomes the wall unto the
[43:36] water is not possible with God
[43:42] says Moses when he says stand still and
[43:45] see the salvation of the Lord what they
[43:46] needed was to stand still yeah because
[43:49] before them is the Red Sea behind this
[43:51] Furious Army besides his mountains it
[43:54] was like they are colored and the enemy
[43:56] was laughing said yeah you are finished
[43:59] but he had problem one in front problem
[44:02] two mayor hiding problem number three on
[44:04] the side so God opens problem number one
[44:07] and then Red Sea opens and brother
[44:10] brothers is when they Stood Still God
[44:13] made their trouble to stand still in
[44:15] salute for them amen
[44:18] salute and Flinch yes
[44:27] and you see I behave like it knew the
[44:30] DNA of the people that are passing amen
[44:32] blessed be the name of the Lord and my
[44:34] brother in your time of Trouble Don't
[44:36] Panic stand still even see this
[44:38] conversation
[44:39] send the signal to the heavens God will
[44:43] make your camera to stand still into it
[44:49] assumes that ah a way it's been made for
[44:52] us they die they dive in and God just
[44:55] waited for them and they go in and hit
[44:59] this way it's only made for God's
[45:01] children
[45:03] Israelites amen and when the last two
[45:06] have crossed
[45:07] it was like the water did another DNA
[45:10] examination
[45:14] this is different
[45:23] [Music]
[45:27] but who are you and the waters
[45:30] because that was not there where my
[45:32] brother my sister but realize how Israel
[45:34] is starting a journey with just my money
[45:41] can you think after this they'll stop it
[45:46] sometimes the promises of God which are
[45:48] so real it becomes so far from us yes
[45:51] amen many times to do with our approach
[45:54] and our attitude
[45:56] yes amen
[45:59] now this was chapter 14 in chapter 15.
[46:03] after this sound a great song
[46:09] after they sing a song of Victory after
[46:11] they saw the dead Egyptians floating in
[46:13] the waters
[46:16] then there's no water to drink
[46:19] I didn't even should have said Victory
[46:22] is my yeah Victory Is Ours
[46:27] literally today is my man they should
[46:30] have said this situation
[46:32] another miraculous amen yes
[46:37] in Exodus 15 24 maybe if you could just
[46:39] cast it for us there the people murmured
[46:42] against Moses saying what shall we drink
[46:46] they are moving from amateurs they're
[46:48] about along the way you see them become
[46:50] professional mammals and then later they
[46:53] become Champion amen
[46:57] [Music]
[46:58] and the genie becomes
[47:00] [Music]
[47:05] so they say what shall we do
[47:11] and we see that in the wilderness
[47:13] against Moses and Aaron
[47:15] honey
[47:17] could help us
[47:21] and what shall we drink
[47:24] I believe the water had become bitter
[47:26] yes the water was bitter amen
[47:29] and yet just a moment there was a tree
[47:31] just around yeah that could sweet in the
[47:34] water yes it was not far it was within
[47:38] the age
[47:41] as a tree of life brother
[47:44] continue your bitter life into Sweet
[47:46] Life Hallelujah it was right
[47:50] by examine the Wilderness nearby and the
[47:54] solution to any situation we face
[47:58] is always nearby
[48:01] for when God answers
[48:05] afraid someone is praying when they were
[48:08] hungry and they needed manner
[48:11] God did not Reigns they have to go
[48:14] kilometers hundreds of kilometers to go
[48:17] and collect the mother it fell the right
[48:18] way
[48:21] God help us
[48:22] [Music]
[48:24] and when they needed Jericho to be taken
[48:27] over God brought the solution right
[48:30] there brought down the Walls when they
[48:33] needed to Cross Jordan God did not open
[48:35] the Waters of of a river you afraid
[48:38] somewhere far there and then I'll go and
[48:40] go like these little circles he just
[48:42] opened exactly the right way and when
[48:46] Goliath needed to be brought down God
[48:49] did not bring a hittite to someone else
[48:52] he just brought a little David so he
[48:55] said the midst of Israel the solution
[48:57] was within Israel amen and he brought
[48:59] down Goliath and my brother my sister
[49:03] I would like to say just like Daniel
[49:05] said there's a man in the Kingdom he's
[49:07] not outside anything you need is you are
[49:10] within the kingdom there is a man in the
[49:12] Kingdom who can turn your Sorrows into
[49:14] Joy he is not far from you so sometimes
[49:17] people say no you know I wish I was
[49:20] living in another country
[49:21] I wish I was in another city in that
[49:24] fellowship and that you just live in the
[49:26] world of wishes
[49:27] God's Solutions are right where you are
[49:30] amen
[49:36] amen blessed be the name of the Lord so
[49:39] it's always important to stop wishing
[49:41] and start living and start being
[49:43] realistic and start believing God that
[49:45] God I believe where I live and where I
[49:48] Fellowship where in the city I live in
[49:50] this is why you will take me to stay and
[49:52] I will stay here and I know that Lord
[49:55] needs I have I have you'll take care of
[49:58] them right where I am otherwise you
[50:01] become an anti-music tourist
[50:04] amen
[50:05] when we just strikes One Church
[50:08] the bills you know the the natural the
[50:12] flight where it's warm they skip the
[50:14] winter here amen and then when they get
[50:17] there they don't realize that it's for
[50:18] that place also operates on seasons
[50:21] they get there when it's warm and rise
[50:22] and then it's all done they say oh it's
[50:24] wonderful I'm happy I'm here after a
[50:26] little while oh it just drives there
[50:28] then they they fly to another place I
[50:31] tell you it's important to be always
[50:33] part of the solution
[50:37] until at the end people churches like
[50:40] stockings
[50:42] ah man God help us the solution is
[50:45] always there all it takes is the right
[50:47] attitude towards the promises of God the
[50:50] word of God we have the right attitude
[50:52] towards it and the right attitude
[50:53] towards the gifts of God
[50:55] it brings about the results amen
[51:02] and then we see in Exodus 17 so Exodus
[51:04] 14 day Mama Exodus 15 uh the water is
[51:08] bitter and then Mama again Exodus
[51:10] chapter 17 there was lack of water
[51:13] and the Bible says maybe if we read
[51:16] verse two wherefore the the people did
[51:19] chai which means to quarrel with Moses
[51:23] saying give us water let me make dream
[51:27] and Moses said unto them one child with
[51:29] me
[51:30] therefore do you tempt the Lord
[51:33] amen so then China cuddled with the
[51:36] prophet the church that they call it
[51:38] with the messenger of their time they
[51:40] chatted with the Exodus message God help
[51:45] us brothers and sisters at any time
[51:47] never to cuddle with the Exodus Prophet
[51:51] but to believe the message he brought to
[51:53] us because we know this message brothers
[51:55] and sisters has not men's Ingenuity it's
[51:59] not some theological uh stuff could have
[52:02] been a theological part somewhere called
[52:04] the Bible school but we know this is the
[52:07] absolute true revelation of Jesus Christ
[52:10] in our day amen may God help us never to
[52:13] child with the message that's why
[52:15] sometimes some rise up and he starts
[52:17] saying I've been in the message eight
[52:19] years and now realize it's not a true
[52:23] gospel
[52:24] uh maybe put this like it's a CV you
[52:28] know kind of but I tell you we don't
[52:31] know the message of Malachi for after
[52:33] the flesh even if someone can come from
[52:36] Jeffersonville Indiana and tell us no
[52:39] because when there was no Prophet he's
[52:40] my my father's cousin actually when he
[52:44] died I was old I was one of his that
[52:46] held his casket and all that even if he
[52:48] can prove
[52:50] means that they are related while
[52:52] telling we are too late the water is
[52:54] we don't know this message after the
[52:57] French but this is in Recreation of
[52:59] Jesus Christ just like if someone Rises
[53:02] up and comes from Bethlehem of Judah and
[53:04] says I am a descendant of millions and
[53:06] Mary and Joseph I had the story of Jesus
[53:09] was just created by our family to
[53:11] immortalize our name in the changes of
[53:14] history and begins to say I tell you
[53:16] there was never any man called Jesus we
[53:18] will tell him we are sorry we realize
[53:20] you're at you we feel pity for you yes
[53:22] but we shall not believe your story
[53:24] because we know that Jesus is Alive we
[53:27] have experience
[53:29] we know Lord Jesus after the flesh but
[53:31] we know him by Revelation amen yes yes
[53:34] so the child with Moses and then we see
[53:37] that the place
[53:39] we hear of the place being called meriba
[53:42] which means strife
[53:44] and Masa which is Temptation where this
[53:47] whole scenario took place
[53:49] amen God help us then in Exodus 16 we
[53:53] see that there was a time when they had
[53:55] no food and the whole communication came
[53:57] again to Moses maybe let's go read this
[54:00] one brothers and sisters Exodus chapter
[54:01] 16 verse 2 I'll try to be quick I won't
[54:04] take long
[54:05] Exodus chapter 16 verse 2 and the whole
[54:08] complication of the children of Israel
[54:09] Mama against Moses and I don't need the
[54:11] Wilderness and the children of Israel
[54:13] said unto them with God that we had died
[54:16] by the head of Moses of the Lord in the
[54:18] land of Egypt when he was sent by the
[54:21] flesh pots and when we did eat bread to
[54:24] the food you have brought us
[54:27] uh forth into this Wilderness to kill
[54:29] this whole assembly with amen
[54:33] now they are complaining but they have
[54:35] seen God opened the Red Sea they have
[54:37] seen God bring down the plagues in Egypt
[54:38] they have seen God open the Red Sea they
[54:40] have seen brothers and sisters God take
[54:42] bitter wanted to Sweet Waters they've
[54:44] seen God Supply water for them from Iraq
[54:47] amen now this is the time where they
[54:49] should be believing God even much more
[54:51] and when they see any challenge they
[54:53] should be saying thank God this is
[54:55] before us very soon we shall see the
[54:57] mighty hand of God the Bible are my
[55:00] sister they are now becoming
[55:01] professional mammers because it looks
[55:03] like it's becoming their occupation and
[55:05] preoccupation
[55:07] amen God help us never to have to have
[55:10] that kind of spirit amen this is the
[55:12] kind that could never enter into the
[55:14] promised land this is the time that God
[55:16] made to wander in the wilderness of 40
[55:19] years when we thank God there was
[55:21] another generation that began to rise up
[55:23] in the generation building just run to
[55:26] the job
[55:28] tonight
[55:28] [Applause]
[55:30] hey man
[55:32] so we see them two months after leaving
[55:34] Egypt they begin to Mama about lack of
[55:36] food and issues of hunger but yet heaven
[55:39] was ready to supply them with food on
[55:41] daily basis
[55:43] and they are talking about the flesh
[55:44] there's so much in the flesh that they
[55:46] may think about the flesh parts of Egypt
[55:49] God help us yes
[55:50] then we see
[55:52] when they come to numbers 11
[55:54] the Bible says there was a lasting among
[55:57] the children of Israel and they wept
[55:59] again and said who shall give us flesh
[56:02] to eat they were not tired of money I
[56:04] mean they said we remember the fish we
[56:06] didn't eat in Egypt feeling the
[56:08] Cucumbers the melons the leeks the
[56:10] onions the garlic they remember the
[56:13] manual of Israel of Egypt by memory yes
[56:16] oh my brother my sister I tell you we
[56:19] don't need to remember the menu of Egypt
[56:21] I tell you we have better food and
[56:24] there's a land of promise we have
[56:26] spiritual food in due season and we see
[56:29] that they will now becoming tired of the
[56:32] manner that God gave them God help us
[56:34] never to get tired of what God gives us
[56:36] and my brother my sister they were out
[56:39] of Egypt but Egypt was not out of them
[56:41] amen see it's one thing to take someone
[56:44] out of the water when they are drowning
[56:46] it's another thing to pump water out of
[56:48] them you can take water out so it's one
[56:51] thing to come out of denomination out of
[56:53] Egypt out of Babylon out of the world
[56:56] Egypt it's another thing process for the
[56:59] Egypt to come out of us for baby not to
[57:02] come out of us amen and you can imagine
[57:05] a man drowning in a swimming pool or in
[57:08] a sea and you dive in you swim you pull
[57:10] him out
[57:11] then when it's fully resuscitated after
[57:14] a few days he starts telling you that
[57:16] even though you rescued him but
[57:19] the way you assuming was not according
[57:22] to International standards of swimming
[57:23] your big Strokes you're not correct your
[57:27] anger and your orientation
[57:32] so imagine this message of Malachi 4
[57:34] rescued us when we were drowning
[57:37] denominations and so on and then after
[57:40] when someone says to Malachi for that no
[57:42] even though you rescued me but however
[57:44] the way you did it the method the
[57:47] methodology the process the work ah man
[57:51] God bless you God help us amen
[57:56] then we see them in Numbers Chapter 14
[57:59] they they begin to murmur about the
[58:01] Giants of the land
[58:03] by this time they have become fully
[58:05] professional yes they are becoming Mama
[58:08] rights
[58:09] amen so God came the money Mama God kept
[58:13] on extending their Journey
[58:15] because that kind cannot enter into the
[58:18] promised land yes blessed be the name of
[58:21] the Lord and then we see the mammary
[58:23] about water and bread in numbers 21 and
[58:26] God sent seconds to bite them
[58:30] and my brother my sister this is the
[58:32] kind that
[58:35] they behaved like they were in an
[58:38] accident
[58:41] like they are forced
[58:44] like it was not their choice to agree to
[58:47] go out
[58:50] saving God was a big
[58:53] big
[58:56] this is the kind that
[58:58] every time they want Moses to do
[59:01] everything for them but they don't want
[59:03] to do anything for themselves
[59:07] this is the kind
[59:09] that God could not allow to enter into
[59:12] the promise amen yes but praise be to
[59:16] God
[59:17] when you're reading Joshua chapter 1.
[59:20] we see a totally different way amen amen
[59:24] we see that
[59:26] Joshua commands these people
[59:29] and they respond and say
[59:31] all that you command us to do we shall
[59:34] do
[59:38] yeah I know this way actually
[59:41] [Music]
[59:43] they're not like real parents only goes
[59:45] a space you push it
[59:47] when you leave it even after 10 years
[59:49] you find it there unless you a cyclone
[59:51] comes to blow it away
[59:53] [Music]
[59:56] yes the Joshua commission amen there was
[1:00:00] this generation
[1:00:03] this generation they never saw uh the
[1:00:07] place fall in Egypt this generation that
[1:00:09] did not hear the First Health commission
[1:00:11] of long suits this generation that we're
[1:00:14] not there when Moses descended from the
[1:00:16] mountain they were not yet born but they
[1:00:19] believe it
[1:00:22] when God showed roses they believe it
[1:00:26] like they had the voice of God
[1:00:27] permission most amen amen amen this is
[1:00:31] the time that enters into the premise
[1:00:33] they believe everything yes they thank
[1:00:35] God at this word and they are
[1:00:39] their inheritance minded they mind about
[1:00:42] eternity Promise by all means
[1:00:48] blessed be the name of the Lord so we
[1:00:51] see under Moses era as we try to
[1:00:54] summarize these people under Moses they
[1:00:56] will just complaining about death and
[1:00:58] Graves and they had a lot of memories of
[1:01:01] Egypt and comparisons and and they they
[1:01:06] were just like it was a very difficult
[1:01:09] church I tell you two million people
[1:01:11] Moses the men of the world no matter
[1:01:13] there is a time when he strikes The Rock
[1:01:15] it's just too much pressure and brother
[1:01:18] Branham tells us that it was just the
[1:01:21] way more people treated Moses it got to
[1:01:24] a point where instead of speaking to the
[1:01:26] Rock the men is so much pressure until
[1:01:29] he lost feeling for them and
[1:01:31] Etc
[1:01:35] I tell you Moses was a great man two
[1:01:39] million people he was the pastor of 2
[1:01:40] million people amen yes sir
[1:01:43] God gave him a very strong wife
[1:01:47] and we also at times begin
[1:01:50] [Music]
[1:01:59] blessed be the name of the Lord then we
[1:02:02] see that under Moses it was just a
[1:02:04] memory generation very argumentative
[1:02:07] they were the fault finding time they
[1:02:09] could not be instructed
[1:02:11] there were just two rules about things
[1:02:13] they could not enter into the end to
[1:02:15] God's rest they were a disrespectful
[1:02:17] generation you know there's a they call
[1:02:19] Moses as for this Moses we don't know
[1:02:22] what the spirit amen and I'm calling the
[1:02:25] prophet like that and even the Pharisees
[1:02:28] calling Jesus as for this fellow I'm in
[1:02:31] the same language yes have they behaved
[1:02:33] as if they were first to come forced by
[1:02:36] Moses to come out of Egypt
[1:02:42] they were behaving like spiritual
[1:02:44] teenagers if they they neither know
[1:02:48] Moses neither is commission but these
[1:02:50] are the people that should have believed
[1:02:51] them Moses much more because they saw
[1:02:54] the glory of God upon his face and
[1:02:56] that's all the glory of God witness my
[1:02:59] brother my sister they saw the place
[1:03:01] called upon Egypt
[1:03:03] yes he said the ones that you have made
[1:03:05] the younger ones they believe even much
[1:03:07] more amen but help us I tell you my
[1:03:10] brother my sister there is not how long
[1:03:12] we have been in the message it's not how
[1:03:14] shocked you have been in the message is
[1:03:16] is the message really inside me
[1:03:20] yeah
[1:03:22] inside me
[1:03:24] amen blessed be the name of the Lord yes
[1:03:34] by Moses when he said let there be fleas
[1:03:37] when he said let that be fraught when he
[1:03:39] said let there be toughness but I
[1:03:41] promise that was the manifestation
[1:03:43] and there was a squeeze
[1:03:47] amen
[1:03:49] so the Red Sea open
[1:03:52] they were a stressful generation they
[1:03:54] wanted Moses to do everything for them
[1:03:56] while they do nothing and if this kind
[1:03:59] crossed the river Jordan to go into the
[1:04:01] Promised Land
[1:04:02] as soon as they cross their Victory
[1:04:03] Moses give us the land
[1:04:06] Moses show us the landmarks Moses Drive
[1:04:09] the Giants out Moses give us the old
[1:04:12] color of the land Moses give us the
[1:04:15] waters away The Well of waters Moses
[1:04:19] it was going to behave everything books
[1:04:22] is different the problem says God does
[1:04:25] not want us to be lazy Chris yes we must
[1:04:28] never be in spiritually Christians yes
[1:04:31] they behave like selfish spoiled
[1:04:34] children they did not have the
[1:04:36] inheritance mentality but let's compare
[1:04:39] with those that enter the promised land
[1:04:40] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:04:43] under Joshua this this generation
[1:04:46] they are not memory generation
[1:04:48] non-argumentative
[1:04:51] they could be instructed they were very
[1:04:52] serious about things amen amen and we
[1:04:56] can see the head that possess us
[1:04:58] inheritus life even the way they speak
[1:05:00] they behave as if they are the ones who
[1:05:02] initiated the actions like they are the
[1:05:05] ones who said let's go out damn it and
[1:05:07] yet they were not born yes
[1:05:12] God blessed in the name of the Lord oh
[1:05:15] my brother my sister many of us here we
[1:05:17] only hear about brother but we were not
[1:05:20] alive we never had the privilege of
[1:05:22] seeing him we never had the privilege of
[1:05:24] hearing himself a million person amen
[1:05:28] and we only see the message many years
[1:05:31] after years passed but when is he fully
[1:05:34] revealed to you you behave like you are
[1:05:37] the one that was there it cleansed me
[1:05:39] that I came with him
[1:05:43] he becomes so real to you it becomes so
[1:05:46] tangible it becomes something so real
[1:05:49] until you believe the message with all
[1:05:51] your heart like that black Americans
[1:05:53] here old man who said I believe it's
[1:05:55] from keeper to Keeper Time discover to
[1:05:58] clever from the cover of the Bible to
[1:06:00] the other cover says I even believe
[1:06:01] where it is
[1:06:02] [Music]
[1:06:07] and they uh they were young but they
[1:06:11] behaved like spiritual adults
[1:06:14] they behaved as if they were with Moses
[1:06:16] when God gave commissioned him with the
[1:06:19] Benin Bush experience
[1:06:21] they behaved as if they were there when
[1:06:24] the third pool was manifested in Egypt
[1:06:26] when Moses said let there be fleas Let
[1:06:28] There Be frogs Let There Be Darkness
[1:06:31] they behaved as if when there's a Red
[1:06:33] Sea open they were there
[1:06:36] ah man this is the kind that enters this
[1:06:40] is the kind that works by faith
[1:06:43] when they saw a pharaoh and his army the
[1:06:46] Bible says they saw I mean they lifted
[1:06:48] up their
[1:06:51] eyesight but this kind that enters into
[1:06:55] the promised land they don't walk by
[1:06:57] sight and Promises
[1:07:06] because faith is a Super Saiyan it puts
[1:07:09] your senses in the body under subjection
[1:07:12] faith and the prophet says it's a
[1:07:14] superior sense it puts even the senses
[1:07:17] in your spirit imagination and all
[1:07:19] others and the subjection and it tells
[1:07:21] them shut up amen
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:25] they were action oriented that's why we
[1:07:28] see that some of them the tribes even
[1:07:30] took their inheritance even before
[1:07:31] Joshua says take your inheritance they
[1:07:33] begin to say Hey where's my Heritage
[1:07:36] then we see Joshua begins to preach to
[1:07:38] some say arise possessive inheritance
[1:07:41] and they begin to go around to survey
[1:07:43] the land
[1:07:45] because seven tribes were not yet taking
[1:07:47] their land and they come with a book a
[1:07:50] book it says in seven Parts they they
[1:07:53] describe the land in a seven part book
[1:07:56] amen amen and they take the entire land
[1:08:01] they had the inheritance mentality
[1:08:03] like the people of the Times of Israel
[1:08:06] amen when you said we shall tell us we
[1:08:10] shall arise and do something
[1:08:12] amen so with Moses
[1:08:15] their view of him was that this is a
[1:08:18] menu because out of Egypt he must ensure
[1:08:19] that all is well with us he must do
[1:08:22] everything for us when we do nothing
[1:08:23] they treated Moses like he was a
[1:08:26] magician who should miraculously provide
[1:08:28] them with water with everything while
[1:08:31] they do nothing this is the kind they
[1:08:34] did to perish in the wilderness
[1:08:36] but these people are the Joshua
[1:08:39] they treated Joshua as a leader that
[1:08:42] they must follow but they are co-workers
[1:08:48] they had to fight the Giants of the land
[1:08:51] we see John Caleb can you say give me my
[1:08:54] money
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:06] this is the way we should approach and
[1:09:09] every promise in the word of God my
[1:09:11] brother my sister why your son give me
[1:09:13] my Mountain I'm walking dead Caleb was
[1:09:16] not interested in Mount Ephraim he was
[1:09:18] not even interested in Mount evil or
[1:09:20] somewhere there but he was interested in
[1:09:22] his heart
[1:09:24] you hear a short joke so if you give me
[1:09:26] my mountain
[1:09:27] foreign
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:40] [Applause]
[1:09:44] like players in the game they were not
[1:09:46] spectators
[1:09:48] it was a spectator it's not a player a
[1:09:52] spectator is a stop saving he's
[1:09:55] imagining things a spectator is a Critic
[1:09:58] a spectator yeah
[1:10:13] it appears very easy from a distance
[1:10:16] That's How The Spectator looks at it but
[1:10:19] I tell you the generation that entered
[1:10:21] into the promised land they were in
[1:10:23] place
[1:10:33] with Christ in the Kingdom that when
[1:10:35] something is being done for the glory of
[1:10:37] God someone must rise up and say where
[1:10:40] is my part in this let me also movement
[1:10:44] and if it's the mentality only people
[1:10:46] under Moses
[1:10:48] these are the kind that wants everybody
[1:10:49] to visit them they visit no one they
[1:10:52] want everybody to pray for them they
[1:10:54] pray for God
[1:10:55] yes but they are in sorrow they want
[1:10:57] everybody to comfort them but they
[1:10:58] Comfort no one
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:08] [Music]
[1:11:14] until they all perished in the
[1:11:17] wilderness yes sir yes
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:34] he says because of unbelief amen so the
[1:11:38] the the length of the time stretching
[1:11:41] from instead of three days to 40 days 40
[1:11:44] years it was to do with their approach
[1:11:47] to the promise that is laid before them
[1:11:49] may God help us brothers and sisters to
[1:11:52] realize that whatsoever promised we have
[1:11:55] before us all we should do is to have
[1:11:57] the right attitude and much into our
[1:12:00] inheritance yeah now let's let me read
[1:12:03] this quotation here brother Brian says
[1:12:05] in Jehovah Jireh and remember you can
[1:12:07] write me down on me Mark me down on the
[1:12:10] paper of time and put it in the history
[1:12:12] when I am passed on that's when I appear
[1:12:15] in the Judgment bar I say this that
[1:12:17] every promise of God in the Bible is
[1:12:19] true so the promise of getting into the
[1:12:22] promised land it was true the god of
[1:12:24] Israel was Almighty all-powerful and now
[1:12:28] he has manifested himself in their time
[1:12:30] as Jehovah Jehovah means the one that
[1:12:34] dwells with his family he was not away
[1:12:36] from them he was right in their
[1:12:38] Mysteries
[1:12:41] amen thank you Lord amen
[1:12:45] amen can be
[1:12:47] tender nights yeah
[1:12:50] their defensive departed from them so
[1:12:52] the challenge was really on the
[1:12:54] inheritance
[1:12:56] amen so every promise in the Bible is
[1:12:59] true
[1:12:59] and if you take the right mental
[1:13:02] attitude towards any different promise
[1:13:05] of God
[1:13:08] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:13:12] Divine promise of God it will bring it
[1:13:16] to us amen no matter how big the promise
[1:13:20] is no matter how small the promise is as
[1:13:23] long as is the promise of God and
[1:13:25] there's a right mental attitude it will
[1:13:28] come to pass
[1:13:30] oh God help us brothers and sisters when
[1:13:34] it's salvation whether it's healing
[1:13:36] whether it's anything deliverance from
[1:13:38] any condition the right mental attitude
[1:13:41] will bring you to pass amen this is what
[1:13:43] makes a difference between people in any
[1:13:45] assembly
[1:13:47] there are some that will have
[1:13:48] testimonies of what God is doing in them
[1:13:51] in their lives right in the church
[1:13:53] whether in the service whether in their
[1:13:55] homes there are some that keep on
[1:13:58] this video right
[1:14:01] is this thing real you know
[1:14:03] what this brother is
[1:14:05] saying this money
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:09] history
[1:14:12] I think of a time when our child was
[1:14:15] sick we traveled to Zambia for a youth
[1:14:17] camp
[1:14:18] about
[1:14:19] 19 years ago
[1:14:22] in you know he said let me pray for the
[1:14:25] child then I saw the pastor who was the
[1:14:27] host pastor of the camp
[1:14:28] passing then I thought ah the man of God
[1:14:31] is passing so I went with my wife and we
[1:14:33] took the past the child to the pastor
[1:14:36] and he just prayed for the child and
[1:14:38] immediately the child got went and
[1:14:40] started playing amen
[1:14:42] jumping everywhere
[1:14:44] amen and yet I could have said okay let
[1:14:47] me just also pray for him because I'm a
[1:14:49] minister but I thought ah the name of
[1:14:51] God is here nearby let me just pass this
[1:14:54] time to here but it's to do with our
[1:14:57] attitude yes yes and God help us to have
[1:15:01] always the right attitude towards any
[1:15:03] Divine yes
[1:15:06] we will also tell you the right mental
[1:15:09] attitude towards any of God's gifts amen
[1:15:13] amen also makes you
[1:15:20] amen whether it's a Teaching Ministry
[1:15:22] whether it's an evangelist whether it's
[1:15:25] pastoral whether it's Apostolic the
[1:15:28] right mental attitude and even the right
[1:15:30] mental attitude between us as Believers
[1:15:33] one-on-one wife and husband
[1:15:36] when your wife says let me pray for you
[1:15:39] and you say ah you really you
[1:15:45] of 24 hours it won't work because you
[1:15:48] have locked up
[1:15:49] amen your mental attitude in such a way
[1:15:51] that you don't believe it but if he says
[1:15:54] honey let me pray for you and he said
[1:15:56] hey I've been thinking about that and
[1:15:59] then she lays heads on you God is able
[1:16:01] to give you blessed be the name of the
[1:16:04] Lord if your husband says let me pray
[1:16:05] for you let me say uh you
[1:16:08] the other day you angry with me do you
[1:16:10] think that God can hear prayers and
[1:16:12] people like you
[1:16:15] that will not work yes and the blockade
[1:16:18] is caused by
[1:16:20] governmental attitude yeah but if we can
[1:16:23] really have confidence is the hardest
[1:16:26] thing for God to do is to make men to
[1:16:29] have confidence in the other man amen
[1:16:32] amen blessed be the name of the Lord God
[1:16:34] help us so he says
[1:16:37] it will bring you to pass remember don't
[1:16:39] forget that if you personally you take
[1:16:41] the right mental attitude towards any of
[1:16:43] the Divine promises it will come to us
[1:16:47] now let's take a conclusion here
[1:16:50] let's go to Joshua chapter 17. amen
[1:16:53] remember we're trying to compare people
[1:16:54] under Moses people and Joshua yes what
[1:16:58] need those that entered into it
[1:17:03] Joshua chapter 17 verse 14 to 15.
[1:17:09] the Bible says in the children of Joseph
[1:17:12] speak unto Joshua saying why has thou
[1:17:15] given me but one lot and one person to
[1:17:19] inherit saying seeing I am a great
[1:17:21] people
[1:17:22] for as much as the Lord had blessed me
[1:17:25] hitherto
[1:17:27] so the children of Joseph after all
[1:17:29] others have been given the inheritance
[1:17:31] they feel like they are not is not
[1:17:33] enough
[1:17:34] somehow they believe they were still
[1:17:36] somebody somewhere I believe that our
[1:17:40] might should not freeze we should always
[1:17:42] believe this
[1:17:44] is more to the experiences we can have
[1:17:47] with Christ
[1:17:50] so all you have experienced is not the
[1:17:53] end of everything even as Jesus said to
[1:17:55] Nathaniel just because I told you I saw
[1:17:57] you under the Fig Tree when before
[1:17:59] Philip called me you believe me you
[1:18:02] shall see greater things yourself this
[1:18:04] is what they end your sin of the Messiah
[1:18:07] the second problem but behold you shall
[1:18:10] see Angels descending in the city
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:14] don't ever leave it toward my brother my
[1:18:16] sister no matter what you've experienced
[1:18:18] no matter what you've encountered in his
[1:18:20] presence I tell you God is more ready to
[1:18:23] give us more and more money do you
[1:18:25] experiences in his presence yesterday
[1:18:29] so they believed there was more
[1:18:32] that they could also receive federal
[1:18:35] now I want us to come to the event the
[1:18:37] words of Joshua
[1:18:39] he says and Joshua answered them if thou
[1:18:42] be a great people
[1:18:44] then get the app to the world country
[1:18:48] and cut down for thyself
[1:18:51] there in the land of the parasites and
[1:18:54] of the Giants if Mount Ephraim be too
[1:18:56] narrow for thee
[1:18:58] this is what Joshua is saying to this
[1:19:02] if what I have given you you feel like
[1:19:05] it's not sufficient
[1:19:07] there is more land
[1:19:08] but I express you I'm not going to cut
[1:19:10] for you amen amen
[1:19:15] amen amen
[1:19:20] to have access
[1:19:23] don't need to be there as Joshua
[1:19:25] you can go ahead
[1:19:28] Joshua is giving them an instruction
[1:19:30] Joshua is authorizing them to say the
[1:19:33] land is enough there's plenty go ahead
[1:19:37] and cut for thyself and he doesn't give
[1:19:40] them a limit to say after so many
[1:19:42] kilometers end there as much as long as
[1:19:45] you can cut for yourself keep on cutting
[1:19:47] for yourself and I'll tell you my
[1:19:49] brother my sister in our spiritual land
[1:19:51] the message of the hour amen everything
[1:19:54] you have need of is right in the word of
[1:19:57] God even if salvation is there if you
[1:20:00] need rest your soul is there forgiveness
[1:20:03] of sin healing of your soul healing of
[1:20:05] your body joyous
[1:20:14] it's all yes
[1:20:18] Hallelujah
[1:20:22] but for you to be a benefactor
[1:20:26] go and cut for this yeah so if you want
[1:20:30] the Holy Ghost God for yourself you have
[1:20:33] to believe
[1:20:36] if you want joy cut
[1:20:41] [Music]
[1:20:48] yes
[1:20:52] don't ever come to this state where you
[1:20:55] take
[1:20:56] some things for granted and just
[1:20:58] resigned to him if a negative fate
[1:21:04] and say you know this is our disease in
[1:21:09] our family
[1:21:10] it is about history
[1:21:12] [Music]
[1:21:14] this is my
[1:21:16] this is my depression this is my
[1:21:19] confusion this is my you know when you
[1:21:23] say something is yours
[1:21:25] it means you own it
[1:21:28] then the question becomes do you have
[1:21:30] any proof it's yours
[1:21:34] any document
[1:21:35] ation that this is the reason why
[1:21:39] [Music]
[1:21:40] think of this yes academic extract comes
[1:21:45] and after it loads will grab it reverses
[1:21:47] right into your yard
[1:21:49] and the Cabbage man begins to Institute
[1:21:52] the Trap is smelling truck and tries to
[1:21:55] offload the cabbage
[1:21:59] if he dumps that cabbage
[1:22:02] yourself
[1:22:04] it has never been used
[1:22:08] the Cabbage from the truck
[1:22:13] you just you just happened to try to
[1:22:15] tell you heard into a main field
[1:22:18] but if you have a titled it
[1:22:21] for that piece of crown no matter
[1:22:23] whether the man is towering tall
[1:22:26] yeah
[1:22:27] even if you're tiny
[1:22:30] any woman you can stand up to him and
[1:22:32] say what is it stop it amen no idea
[1:22:36] Toppings is not weird try next door
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:45] you know what belongs to you and you
[1:22:48] know that this doctor did gives me
[1:22:49] Authority and power and if he insists
[1:22:52] that he's going to do it you have the
[1:22:54] power to summon the wrong trust to come
[1:22:56] in and fast your rights
[1:22:58] amen blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:23:01] don't ever say my my sorrow my what my
[1:23:03] heart amen blessed be the name of the
[1:23:05] Lord Jesus never said my soul I give
[1:23:07] unto you my restlessness I give unto you
[1:23:09] my sickness I give unto you amen my
[1:23:13] confusion I give unto you but Jesus is
[1:23:15] my peace I give unto you and joy I give
[1:23:17] unto you my rest I give unto you this is
[1:23:20] what Jesus saying that if the enemy
[1:23:22] brings something else he just remember
[1:23:24] that he's trying to make you attempt
[1:23:26] inside you have the power like those and
[1:23:29] the Joshua's commission to say no no no
[1:23:31] no this is not mine mine is a land
[1:23:34] fruits fluffs with milk and honey mind
[1:23:37] is well I have everything salvation of
[1:23:40] my soul that's why I have healing of my
[1:23:42] soul that's why I have everything amen
[1:23:45] I must have a mind and an attitude to
[1:23:48] possess and enter to that promise that's
[1:23:51] what was the difference it's what made
[1:23:54] such a short Journey such a long journey
[1:23:57] my brother my sister
[1:23:58] sometimes we say I've been praying to
[1:24:00] receive the Holy Ghost for so long why
[1:24:02] is God not filling me with the Holy
[1:24:04] Ghost sometimes
[1:24:05] [Music]
[1:24:06] we say why is what not
[1:24:09] but yet it might be to do this yes
[1:24:12] yes you don't believe it enough
[1:24:15] oh our mental attitude for our mental
[1:24:19] black we have preconceived ideas of what
[1:24:21] the Holy Ghost is you cannot receive the
[1:24:23] Holy Ghost until you know who the Holy
[1:24:25] Ghost is and what he does when he has
[1:24:27] come amen amen sometimes you see I've
[1:24:30] been praying why am I not eating healed
[1:24:33] if God is Not testing for your faith
[1:24:35] because he also sometimes can test
[1:24:37] he can try your faith and the drivers is
[1:24:40] the time of your faith
[1:24:42] if it's like that maybe it might be
[1:24:45] where we doubt a bit we we we we we
[1:24:48] begin to think maybe it will awake when
[1:24:52] God wants maybe when he's happy
[1:24:55] God help us brothers and sisters we have
[1:24:58] a real inheritance
[1:25:00] it's within our reach is within our axis
[1:25:04] any one of us we can have faith enough

[1:25:10] yet speak these words the
[1:25:13] may God help us and may God bless you
[1:25:16] richly that we should be that kind of
[1:25:18] Generation
[1:25:19] all who you tell us we shall do wherever
[1:25:22] you send us we shall do we shall go and
[1:25:25] that kind is the ones that entered into
[1:25:28] the promised land may God bless you
[1:25:31] richly amen God bless you pastors

[1:26:23] Holy Ghost do we know his workings
[1:26:26] amen amen
[1:26:30] if it's our inheritance
[1:26:32] to be possess it
[1:26:35] but Branham says the only one that's
[1:26:37] going in the Rapture is the man
[1:26:39] of the Holy Ghost amen God the token
[1:26:41] amen I believe on the token
[1:26:45] now that we can answer those questions
[1:26:47] if we are walking in the land I mean if
[1:26:49] you want to make a claim tonight
[1:26:51] [Music]
[1:26:52] there's many gifts of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:57] one the working of Miracles
[1:27:00] the word of knowledge
[1:27:02] amen we've had the revelation of the
[1:27:04] word tonight
[1:27:05] and after the preaching of the word
[1:27:09] amen comes through worship Hallelujah
[1:27:13] and true worship can only come thank you
[1:27:16] when we know who he is
[1:27:20] even as Daniel prophesied that the shall
[1:27:22] come of people in the last days
[1:27:25] that know that God shall do great
[1:27:27] exploits
[1:27:28] amen amen I want you to just be reverent
[1:27:31] in his presence
[1:27:33] the Lord does not manifest himself
[1:27:36] through the preaching of his word
[1:27:37] because the word brings revelation
[1:27:40] and what the Revelation comes power
[1:27:44] [Music]
[1:27:45] holy ghost power is here
[1:27:49] if you have a need you want to raise
[1:27:50] your hand at this time
[1:27:55] amen even as we mentioned a few prayer
[1:27:57] requests before we started
[1:28:01] if you want to raise your hand you can
[1:28:03] stand in the gap
[1:28:05] do you know one time they came
[1:28:07] a man to Jesus
[1:28:13] and his servant was sick at home
[1:28:16] maybe his servant didn't even know
[1:28:20] what was going on because the Bible says
[1:28:22] he was sick unto death
[1:28:24] he didn't even know where his master was
[1:28:28] he didn't know his master was gone all
[1:28:30] the way to see Jesus to ask for his
[1:28:32] healing
[1:28:33] somebody that you love probably don't
[1:28:36] even know that you are in his presence
[1:28:38] right now
[1:28:40] can stand in the Gap and say Lord
[1:28:43] I have somebody in need
[1:28:46] and Lord you don't even have to go there
[1:28:49] but you can just speak the word
[1:28:52] and it shall be so the Bible says the
[1:28:55] very same hour that Jesus spoke that
[1:28:58] word
[1:28:59] the servant was healed
[1:29:02] I ask you can you raise up to that level
[1:29:04] of Faith because Jesus said I've never
[1:29:06] seen such great faith in all of Israel
[1:29:09] amen amen
[1:29:12] hallelujah for those of you that have
[1:29:15] Beyond raised
[1:29:16] and you need a touch from the Lord
[1:29:19] amen how many of you have a second body
[1:29:21] and need a touch from the Lord can I see
[1:29:23] your hand amen anybody sit near the
[1:29:25] touch from the Lord
[1:29:27] anybody seeking the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:29] Ghost anybody seeking a refilling of the
[1:29:32] Holy Ghost
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:36] and while we have the men of God
[1:29:40] remember what the pastor just said now
[1:29:42] our attitude
[1:29:44] our mind and our attitude towards the
[1:29:46] things of God
[1:29:48] look at what the angel told the prophet
[1:29:50] if you can get the people to believe you
[1:29:53] yes
[1:29:55] he says not even cancer will be able to
[1:29:56] stand in your way
[1:30:01] and I tell you we haven't been called to
[1:30:04] this service
[1:30:05] for no reason because
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:10] the Lord wants to move in a special way
[1:30:14] but can we allow him to move
[1:30:16] you've heard the message tonight
[1:30:18] are we willing to allow the spirit of
[1:30:21] God to move
[1:30:23] amen hallelujah
