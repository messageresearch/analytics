[2:17] greet you all in the precious name of
[2:18] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[2:21] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[2:22] to worship Him amen hallelujah amen I if
[2:25] you're rejoicing with the word amen good
[2:28] to see every one of you am amen I missed
[2:30] you on Sunday amen not being here with
[2:33] you but I believe amen you were blessed
[2:36] with the word am amen hallelujah have
[2:39] positive feedback about Sunday service
[2:41] amen and I believe you all blessed with
[2:42] the word of God amen
[2:45] hallelujah amen I was out there at IL
[2:48] Tabernacle and it was a privilege to be
[2:51] a part of the celebration of Pastor Dan
[2:53] n amen having turned 80 years old you
[2:57] know the Lord had changed the years of
[2:58] man on the Earth
[3:00] and man was never meant to die but after
[3:03] the fall in Noah's time he said man's
[3:05] days will be 120 years amen but then sin
[3:09] that still kept in and then he reduced
[3:10] the number of years for man and then you
[3:13] find in the Psalms it's telling you that
[3:16] it's appointed to every man three score
[3:18] and 10 and he says if by virtue of Grace
[3:21] then 80 years amen so the brother has
[3:23] seen 0 years some people live a bit
[3:25] longer but a man he's been faithful in
[3:29] the gospel faithful Steward of the Lord
[3:33] amen he's been a faithful servant of God
[3:36] so continue to pray for Pastor Dan we're
[3:38] not sure amen how much longer the Lord
[3:40] will allow him to be here but we need to
[3:44] give honor where honor is due amen amen
[3:46] hallelujah and we rather give them a
[3:49] rose while they alive yes amen amen now
[3:52] think about it this way God called him
[3:54] to be one of the first men to be in an
[3:56] area where there was no mess's church
[4:01] and to do something and believe
[4:03] something that's rejected of men they're
[4:07] calling you a cult they calling all
[4:08] kinds of things so you must really hear
[4:10] from
[4:11] [Music]
[4:12] God Amen to be able to go out yes Amen
[4:16] to stand in the midst of criticism yes
[4:19] Amen to stand as one of the Pioneers
[4:21] there's nobody else no other churches
[4:23] around so you must have heard from God
[4:26] Amen he went out with the 10 meetings
[4:27] and he went out amen evangelizing amen
[4:30] and the Lord has been gracious to him I
[4:32] believe amen you know the prophet says
[4:34] that he was taken up into this place and
[4:36] he was shown a time of
[4:38] rewards hallelujah amen I believe our
[4:41] brother has a great reward in store
[4:43] brother Bram says one Soul attached to
[4:47] your name it'll be wrapped around your
[4:49] name for
[4:50] eternity and he says one soul is worth
[4:52] 10,000 worlds amen so we should do what
[4:55] we can to witness for the Lord amen
[4:57] praise the Lord so I was really happy to
[4:59] be there a part of the celebration and
[5:01] share the word of the Lord uh if you
[5:03] don't know amen Pastor Dan actually
[5:06] dedicated me as a baby amen so for me it
[5:09] was a special privilege to be able to go
[5:11] there and honor the man of God for his
[5:14] 80th birthday amen so he's been a pastor
[5:17] to pastors Hallelujah he's been a
[5:19] faithful servant of God and we pray the
[5:21] Lord will continue to bless him amen so
[5:23] let's turn to our Bibles praise the
[5:26] Lord amen let's turn to Ephesians
[5:28] chapter 1
[5:42] I want to say this to you this evening
[5:45] grace be to you amen and peace amen from
[5:49] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[5:52] Christ amen amen amen blessed be the God
[5:56] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[5:58] had blessed us with all spiritual
[6:00] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[6:04] amen according as he had chosen Us in
[6:07] him before the foundation of the world
[6:09] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[6:12] before him in love now that's God's
[6:14] expectation of us amen having
[6:17] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[6:20] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[6:23] according to the good pleasure of his
[6:25] will amen you may be seated praise the
[6:27] Lord
[6:33] amen so people in this life they live
[6:38] their lives wondering what their purpose
[6:39] is what am I really called for and
[6:42] nobody really can find the answer to it
[6:45] except we find it in the word of God
[6:47] when men probe they probe and they look
[6:49] at maybe Evolution and they probe at how
[6:52] they were formed on the earth and they
[6:54] science wants them to believe or the
[6:56] world system want them to believe that
[6:58] they are random act

[7:17] identity amen whether they're a man or a
[7:20] woman they can't Define what a woman is
[7:23] they can't Define what a man is amen
[7:25] that has reached a level of insanity
[7:28] amen but what a comfort we have to know
[7:32] that we can go to the word of God and
[7:35] not only tell you your Origins but also
[7:38] tell you what he predestinated you to
[7:40] become amen amen hallelujah yes to go to

[44:18] holy be holy
[44:21] amen amen oh praise the Lord praise the
[44:24] Lord praise the Lord amen that's why the

[44:30] things like fasting on doctrines of this
[44:32] and that and this and that baptisms and
[44:34] godheads and all of these things but he
[44:36] says let us move onto
[44:41] Perfection I would have loved to have
[44:43] this conversation with you maybe 5 years

[44:57] amen so we want to thank the Lord that
[44:59] he's been rich in Mercy like the Bible
[45:01] says in Ephesians he's been the god of
[45:03] Grace he's been the god of Mercy many
[45:07] times Satan could have ended our Lives
[45:09] Many Times Satan come upon us we could
[45:11] have been despondent given up left the
[45:13] message of the hour amen people attacked
[45:16] us amen maybe sometimes you felt
[45:18] oppressed amen maybe sometimes you felt
[45:20] the attack so strong upon your life you
[45:22] didn't know which way to turn you just
[45:24] felt like giving up but something kept
[45:26] holding you amen Something Told You Hold
[45:29] on Amen you felt that tug within
[45:32] you praise the
[45:35] Lord rich in Mercy is our God Amen he's
[45:39] full of grace and he's poured his grace
[45:41] upon me called us to this elevated
[45:43] position so that we can see a far off we
[45:45] don't have to be Earthbound and trapped
[45:48] by latan spirits in the chicken yard but
[45:50] I can SW like a flying eagle because
[45:54] I've been equipped with the spirit of a
[45:56] flying Eagle amen the bride under a
[45:59] messenger amen becomes the final voice
[46:01] to the final
[46:04] age some people call their own Prophet a
[46:10] liar some people call their own Prophet
[46:13] a liar and how of you know sometimes
[46:15] they don't physically say it with words
[46:16] but there's a saying that actions speak
[46:18] louder than
[46:22] words so they call their own Prophet a
[46:25] liar in fact they call call their own
[46:27] father a
[46:31] liar because their father said the bride
[46:35] under her messenger becomes the final
[46:39] voice to the final
[46:43] age your father said
[46:47] it now you want to make your father a
[46:50] liar by denying it by silencing the
[46:55] final voice
[46:59] amen but when we are flying now soaring
[47:02] amen we are not bumping into any other
[47:04] birds yeah we only should be bumping

[47:31] angels his position was
[47:34] elevated position was
[47:37] elevated I was hearing a brother say
[47:40] this and it really got me to think maybe
[47:42] we didn't understand those things too
[47:44] well maybe we don't understand
[47:48] it to its full
[47:51] effect what
[47:53] happened he's caught up in the
[47:55] constellation of angels
[47:58] and he's trying to describe it hello you
[48:01] believe the prophet was caught up yes
[48:03] amen amen you can read in the Book of
[48:07] Matthew Mark Luke and John when they are
[48:09] telling you the account of
[48:12] when Jesus is lifted up into a cloud on
[48:17] Mount
[48:17] Transfiguration and now they entered
[48:19] into the
[48:21] cloud
[48:23] yes amen so ask you yourself
[48:27] this when science took the
[48:30] picture they measured it at being 26 mil
[48:35] high and 30 Mi
[48:38] wide but the Striking thing
[48:41] is cuz you think the prophet maybe was
[48:44] caught up here
[48:47] there there is no
[48:51] oxygen at 26 mil High yeah
[48:58] hello so how can you breathe
[49:01] there they say that
[49:04] altitude you can't breathe you'll
[49:08] die so what happened to
[49:13] you
[49:15] hello why you looking
[49:19] away I'm asking you to face up to the
[49:22] question amen come I go put you 26 miles
[49:25] high and see
[49:30] he says in a moment in the twinkling of
[49:32] an
[49:33] eye faster than you can blink your eyes
[49:37] he's trying to tell you something
[49:39] there quicker than you can blink your
[49:46] eyes he was caught up into the
[49:47] constellation of
[49:50] angels amen praise the Lord food for
[49:53] thought right you can think about it I
[49:56] never tell you anything anything I just

[50:02] you amen C up in this constellation
[50:06] caught
[50:09] up now you know when we're in an
[50:12] astronaut age right I'm closing now we
[50:13] in an astronaut
[50:15] age when you're an
[50:17] astronaut you go through training
[50:20] there's a time for training
[50:23] simulation simulation training Mark 16
[50:29] scriptures call the Elders of the church
[50:32] simulation
[50:34] training amen but there's a time when
[50:39] the
[50:40] training
[50:41] now must put you in your
[50:44] suit it's no ordinary suit you can't go

[51:16] right yes
[51:18] amen and then they send you so I just I
[51:21] just detailed there the four stages
[51:25] because I'm showing you five fingers I
[51:27] know four four stages because under
[51:29] justification the prophet says you are
[51:31] like that glass who is
[51:33] chosen you selected then that glass as
[51:37] dirty as it may be so remember that word

[52:30] hallelujah
[52:32] amen so now it comes time sit in that
[52:35] you must sit in a specialized
