wherever you come from your toils of life from the toilets that we go through in the flesh amen we need to come and be refreshed from god [Music] reading from chapter 18 read from verse 16 genesis chapter 18 reading from verse 16 and the men rose up from theirs and looked towards sodom abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from ibrahim that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation amen amen and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him see this is a personal relationship amen the lord don't want to hide his mystery from abraham amen amen amen he says that he will command his children yes and his household after him amen and they shall keep the way of the lord yes to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon ibrahim that which he had spoken of him the lord wanted to reveal this mystery to abraham because abraham will command his children amen amen and there's been a spiritual father in this day amen another one with seven letters amen amen and came and stood up the food because why he will command that she's spiritual children amen and they shall keep the way of the lord when will it come in a time when it's like sodom amen when the world is in another southern condition yes amen god will not withdrawals amen what he wants to do amen amen to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he had spoken of him iman you may be seated thank god for the reading of his word so here the lord we know what happened there to the time of judgment amen but we know that abraham was typing adriam and sarah was typing the bride yes because they before the destruction upon sodom they had a visitation yes amen amen wherein god could discern sarah's hearts and thoughts and we revealed that that was revealing that mystery that will happen in this day amen and that was before the promised sun could come but upon that visitation and that revealing of sarah's heart took place after that we know that you dare to be a body change yes and abraham recognized when the angel of god when god appeared to him because why the three men worked there and he said my lord amen he didn't say my lord yeah amen so this was in revelation and it was revealed to abraham yes abraham could identify his god amen amen amen we know that we are living the time when the seven seals have been open amen and we find that all these mysteries have been revealed to us because it says in the days of the voice of the seven angel yes when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god shall be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets and then tonight we're speaking on the rapture and to whom the word of the lord came amen because we know the rapture is not a public show yes amen the rapture is a great secret yes amen that god kept away i was listening to a clip last night and one of these theologians was speaking about the prophet and it's amazing how they started the clip and they'll speak about the supernatural things that took place and then as they go on they say but william branham was meant for the prayer lines is he he was nowhere to be a preacher and there was there was uplifting uh uh people like jima shikarian and so forth people that would leave the prophets you see you see how blind they are and these people were going by yesterday things that they heard and they spoke about the prophet's end but they wouldn't go back in the bible and look at how all the dark ages and all these all the apostles and how they all died amen and all these things and they find that the prophet have died prematurely but the prophet and he mentioned one the starting statement he spoke about the time the period where the prophet just left them when they had all these places booked what they didn't realize because that was for him to go and meet and have his personal experience of god because it was time of the coming of the seven angels amen they didn't know it wasn't for them because why it was a status of the rapture cycle amen and this would not be a public show amen because under that first two polls they was using him for the prayer line they booked all these places and things like that but they don't know that god used it for his purpose amen that was just an attraction yes but he was hunting he was fishing there for the rainbow trout amen amen then he had to go off the scene and go to and follow the leadership of the holy spirit yeah and he speaks about it the year before so this is the time of the end and he gives the vision and he speaks division right there and then scripture must be fulfilled amen you see they missed all these things but literally no that's why you said you had to bypass the theologians yes it had to come the word of the lord have to come to the prophet amen yes because the prophet could identify who he was amen the prophet could say that's my lord up there amen because why the start of the rapture cycle had to come amen let's turn our bibles to the book of second preacher in chapter 1 verse amen the rain falls on the just and the unjust we know that so the word of the lord came to everybody was preached to everybody but it was not revealed to him amen amen grace and peace be multiplied unto you to the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power had given unto a house all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that it called us to glory and virtue whereby are given and she was exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world to lust amen yes not everybody have been given to be partakers of the divine nature amen amen there to be a new birth yes yes you have to die to that old man yes amen because that old man brought you in brought you into this world speaking lives shaped in inequity born in sin it comes from that old nature because of the first man adam all have fallen into depth yeah but by the second adam amen we have the opportunity now to be partakers of the divine nature amen and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue amen here's the man that's walking in the rapture cycle now amen head to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patient godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity amen for if these things be in you and abound they make you that they shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen but he that lacked these things is blind you see they can be preaching the gospel they can have the gifts of the holy spirit but they don't have the holy spirit himself the person of the holy ghost is not dwelling in them yeah the person of the holy ghost is not there to navigate their lives the person of the holy ghost is not there to teach them because he is the teacher amen he will bring you into knowledge of all these glorious truths amen he will reveal he will enlighten you on this word and he will make you realize that this day we had a visitation this day and through this prophet he came and revealed himself amen hallelujah but he that look at this thing is blind who's blind this lady's here in church amen and cannot see a far off you see they're looking for the flesh they're looking for the time that they're living in they're looking at in this world cosmos yes but to us we have been taken to an unseen world we have been shown a far off amen amen while we are seated here we are now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus yes you can look beyond this dimension amen because why there was one that went beyond the curtain of time amen that told us about another world amen there was the one that came and came to win in spite of the land and come to give us a good report amen and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins yes wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things shall never fall for someone entering shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ now if you read that scripture and if you look at it you might say now do i have to go and make myself do this now you cannot do that on your own amen that takes the grace of god yes and that takes divine revelation he has to bring you into his word amen and he takes the leadership of the holy spirit to build you up because what they don't realize that god is building you up like our enoch in the time when we build this pyramid it was a type of this body of christ because this is typing the body of christ that she will come into this perfect image amen amen amen this is building you up into an image amen which is the temple of god amen and you just come into the most holy temple yes amen we're not talking about a literal temple we're talking about the most holy temple because what this is the temple that god will dwell in amen he said but each age god has placed these things into his church and threatened it by showing that each individual as these possess these qualities and this being when it's completed is the church of god going to rapture amen so this is the age where this body must come into the image amen because in the time when jesus gave up the ghosts and he says when he gave up the ghost the graves were opened and he says at his resurrection they raised up from the graves yes where where did they raise up at his resurrection they raised up from the graves that was his resurrection of his literal body and now it is a resurrection of his spiritual body amen and if this is the hour where the body is raised up the rising of the sun and the rising of the body amen is the rising of the son in this day rising of christ the body of christ has risen up from all these ages amen amen then what are we living in now amen there must be a time when there must be an emptying out yes amen if this body is risen up and she's rised up in a power right up rise up as the body of christ in this hour and recognizing a position in christ recognizing who she is now so this is the hour where there must be an empty house amen because in the time of the literal body of christ raising up two thousand years ago the graves people raised up from the graves the old testament sins and if that pattern was in the bible we must find his scripture amen if that pattern it was in the bible it must happen now a mess when this body is raised up that means that when this body is ready should i say when she's raised up and come to a position when she's come to that super church when she's recognized to be that super race when she recognized to be that invincible honey amen amen she become the final hour in the final voice in the final day amen then there must be an emptying out of that sixth dimension and if you can show me any other our ways closer now this is our man and this being incompleted is a servant of god in the church of god that's going in the rapture glory see what i mean there you are that's the full thing [Music] it says and then god through that has brought also seven church ages to show the seven steps that he brought building his individual into his image yes he built a complete church in his image amen [Music] so this body must be in that image yes amen that body must be that city that will come down amen and he's not made up of just this church age is made up of seven church ages amen amen this pyramid city is made up of seven church ages yes amen and at the resurrection this complete body will be raised up to live with him forever because it is a bride so that cuts in every age every age that comes yes amen [Music] now when he visited abraham he said he knows abraham god said i know abraham because why he was part of god yes amen he was an attribute of god everything about hatred on earth was displaying the characteristics of god yes amen and there must be a bride in this day just like how there was and it there was one in this day that came as the first chief way before us as a true example of how every son and daughter of god should be the one that manifested the attributes of god yeah the one that can add the characteristics of christ and now after him many others will come because why they believe these words yes amen amen if any word that he received they will receive amen because what revelation 10 8 11 says john went and took the book amen and he began to eat the book amen amen and that was typing the bride to whom the word of the lord came amen amen did the word of the lord come to you amen so god looked at abraham and he said basically he said shall i withdraw from abraham what i'm gonna do he began to reveal the mystery to him yes he began to unlock the secrets of how he has been destroying man sodom and tomorrow and he began to unlock he began to open up break that seven seals when he come revelation down 1 comes down and he opened up that seven seals yes he unlocked the mysteries to us amen or what's been happening in all ages yes how the writer was writing and how he's what he's doing right now in the shower and how he's going to deceive how his writing now receiving the nation and helen that followed him didn't help follow him so you see we're not unawares of what is happening amen and we can see the world in the condition that they're going in and man is getting deceived thinking he's living on yeah now he's excited because why he says no the covert is finished and everything is back to normal you see the scoffers will rise up thinking that everything is normal what they don't realize what was happening behind the scenes they can't identify what was happening in the russia war why they had to be that war they don't realize that israel was going back to the homeland amen they don't realize that the kings of the north was gathering they don't realize that rome was also calling the people together behind the scenes you see then the prophet says she can start to walk she can stop her amen they don't see that and they think everything is back to normal that's why the world could criticize the cloud what is this mysterious cloud it was a rocket it was this it was that or the other but to whom the word of the lord came we'll understand we'll take that cloud we'll look at the vision of the prophet the year before we'll take it in the scripture it says revelation 10 1 and then you can put a date to it when was revelation 101 fulfilled 1963 take a date and put it to it because why she will understand when was angel why was angel descended amen what was the purpose because why the book had to be opened your name had to be revealed amen amen redemption had to be revealed to you amen redemption god had to show you that i'm taking you back to your original condition yes i was discussing with brother adrian the other day i said you know it's not like taking if somebody stole something from me and saying i'm going to give you something else to compensate you for that no this is giving me back what i'm supposed to yes not something else yeah that's why job when the bible said god given him all these things god job could have what he originally had amen job could have that he could see the last days he could see his redeemer on the earth amen yes he had them he had the revelation of that god revealed it to him what's gonna happen in the last day he said i know my redeemer liveth amen amen and he knew in his flesh he will see god yes [Music] so all these things was revealed to us we look at enoch let's look at genesis chapter five i'm reading from verse five amen let's read a few scriptures please bear with me amen you love the word amen i'd be grateful that we have those things revealed to us and all the days that adam lived we're 930 years and he died and seth lived in 105 years and began in us and seth lived after he begat enos 807 years and began sons and daughters and all the days of said were 912 years and he died [Music] and enos lived 90 years and begat canaan and enos looked after he began canaan 815 years and began sons and daughters and all the days of inners were 905 years and he died and caitlyn lives 70 years and begets 840 years and began sons and daughters and all the days of canaan were 910 years and he died and and he lived 60 and five years and became jared and my hair mahel la hill lived after he began jared 830 years and he began sons and daughters and hold the days of mahela where 895 years and he died see everyone is dying and jared lived in 162 years and he begat enoch and jared lived after he beget enoch 800 years and he began sons and daughters and all the days of gerald were 960 and two years and he died now six people have died so far he has the seventh now and enoch lived sixty and five years and beget mitchella and enoch worked with god and after he began metrocellular 300 years he began sons and daughters and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years and enoch walked with god they sing that thing again they're saying that part again now the scripture is emphasizing now and enoch worked with god and he was not for god took him yes the seventh one that walked with god he is the seventh one who god revealed himself to amen to whom the word of the lord came yes amen to whom the word of the lord came will have a translation to whom [Music] the one that communicated with god amen and therefore he built that pyramid because there was gonna be typing the pride amen amen because we know that pyramid was the type of the bible yes before that they were studying the stars amen and then he looks type is bullying the predator was typing for the type of the bible amen and then we have the written words and now we have the word who are now in human flesh again we are the living apostles read and all known of all men amen the bible now is a body of christ displaying the word she is coming to the word image amen [Music] so if you want to see the word now it must be displayed in human flesh it must be a manifested word this is the hour where the word must be manifested yes because we know the letter killers by the spirit giveth life amen amen this is the hour for life giving amen now enoch had a personal relationship with god amen he has a man that's going in the rapture the man that has a personal work with god the man that will guide yourself yes the man will say surrender himself i want to be a prisoner of christ the man will not take man-made creeds man-made dogmas the man that recognized that whom the word of the lord came to because that's what happened in this day they refused to accept the messenger yes and the messenger was the key to the age amen he unlocking the mysteries but they refused to accept the messenger by those that came and accepted the messenger and his message and has become one with the message they are that's the man that's going in the rapture amen that's the one to whom the word of the lord come to amen that's the one that's going to be a living epistle that's going to be read and known of all men amen that's the man that's sitting now in heavenly places in christ jesus that's the man that can see far off amen that's the man that's partakers of his divine nature amen in other words if he's particularly divine nature recognizing now it's not my spirit that's living in me but the spirit of christ working through me amen [Music] so that was enoch's rapture amen yes and the book of jude says and enoch lived sorry and enoch also the seven from adam prophesied of these things saying behold the lord covered with ten thousand of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all there are speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him what they mean by speaking against him he's not just talking about the people that spoke about him two thousand years ago about the one that spoke against his words all the ages amen and in this last day they will come against his words those that come and crucified the word they come and rejected this christ through his word amen [Music] these are murmurs complainers walking after their own lust and their mouth speaking great swelling words like as i was telling you now this theologian was speaking last night speaking about how they are protecting the people from false doctrines and having men's persons in admiration because of advantage what's the advantage they want material gain they want to gain popularity yes they want to gain money they want all these things from the that will satisfy the flesh but there was a prophet of god that was willing everyone would reject him all the people that was around him arranging all his crusades and the campaign the 10 meetings and so forth they all will reject him when when it comes to the time of the opening of the word under the first two pulls an evil and adulterous generation seeking after signs coming in the message coming for all the meeting giving support to the meetings but when it comes to the opening of the world yes this would not be a public show because why this wasn't wasn't for everybody amen amen the book of 1 thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 and i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even at others which have no hope when we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also would sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout amen with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord [Music] now we know in the rapture message the prophet is telling us [Music] he says now i want you to notice a great thing taking place here now don't miss this the word year says in second thessalonians that there is three things from the 13th to the 16th verse there's three things that has to happen before the lord himself appears yes he's talking about before he corporately appears amen quickly now so we can close the first thing happens notice they shout yes a voice he trumpets he lays it out for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of the archangel the trump of god three things a void sorry a shout a voice a trumpet it has to happen before jesus appeared amen now a shout jesus does all three of them when he's descending a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth first amen the living bread of life bringing forth the bride so that was the start of the rapture the cycle of the rapture process was a shout amen which was the message going forth amen to gather the living saints anna and one cry went out to cry out behold the bridegroom cometh who was that the friend of the bridegroom was crying out beyond the bridegroom comet because why all 10 virgins were asleep but they came out they woke up from the sleep because they were awakened yeah when they seven thunders after their voices there was an awakening but the ones were all in the lamp yes amen they was the one who'll go in amen and the ones without oil they came to the ones with oil and they had oily enough for themselves because why they was believing this word they went to stages it was a process it was a process all the way from egypt amen it was a process coming up from egypt to cadiz bania all the way to the river jordan to cross over jordan and get into the land of inevitable process amen and now they're coming in the last minute and say give us some of your oil [Music] no go and buy from them that sell amen all these people you know what faint was they make merchandise of you to satisfy your itchy ears they're coming with their own doctrine with their own creeds and when they fail words go by from them so they'll give you pentecostal blessings and so forth jumping up and down and so forth no but this ride had the oil amen yeah what it takes yes that will give them a body change they have what it takes amen they receive the baptism of the holy ghost which was the wedding garments amen there what it takes to go into the wedding supper [Music] amen [Music] amen so who who will send the lord himself amen shall descend from heaven with a shout out amen that was the appearing that was missed amen because but we know because there was a man that could come and turn on the lights amen amen we recognize the mighty god unveil before us yes the presence of god misunderstood [Music] and we know that this mighty god was becoming plain view before us there's no there's no description seasonings there's no reasoning behind it we can see it by faith amen because it's revealed to us yes thank you amen do you thoroughly believe it because it's convinced within the soul amen nothing can take that away from you nobody can lie to you that that's give you a scientific explanation for you amen because you can tie it back to the words amen because the word is the absolute amen here's the one that could come and say the greater solomon is here amen who he was introducing jesus christ to us amen he was a friend of the bridegroom uniting us with the dry broom that we could have our identification in him yes and we could recognize that we are part of him yes amen we could recognize that all that he has we are co-heirs with him yes amen amen we could recognize that we were always part of this mystery amen we are always the back part of god's mind he could take us right to the back part of god's mind show me which theologian can take you and do that because why if you're not particularly divine it you cannot see a fire off amen oh man he says the first thing comes when he starts descending from heaven there's a shout what is it a message to get the people together are we gathered together in jeffersonville are we gathered together you know in a certain you must be under a certain message minister no we are gathered together with a message yes wonderful the mystical body of christ amen and you have your part to play in that body no matter whether you defeat no matter which part you are but you have a part to play in that body amen amen you might have different gifts in the body but you are part of that body and each one is needed amen there's no one greater than the other yes and no one can do without the other in the body if one part of the body is sick then other part will also feel it hey man if the leg got a problem oh the whole body is battling because of the leg yes if the stomach got a problem the whole body is battering because of that so each one is quickly joined together amen so he says a message come forth first now what lamb trimming time rise and trim your lambs watch what watch was that sorry what watch was that the seventh not the sixth that's why we said from adam everyone the sixth night of the six died yes when he come to the seventh he was translated we had all six ages amen and everyone had to go by the way of deaths but when we come to the servants amen we know that we're not talking about people who go by the way i'm talking as an age amen this is the age that will meet the condition for the rapture amen amen in the seventh world champion in that seven age this is the age that will meet the condition that was a condition whereby you can have rapturing faith amen because why he was given rapture in grace amen amen so it's a time to be a it's time to rise and swim your land yes why i say rise because there must be a rising of the bright because this body had to rise amen just like our 2000 years ago jesus body had to be resurrected and then the graves let out his bodies just like that his body had to come now and rise in power yes rise to that invincible army rise to that super race rise to this characteristic that's spoken of her yes that there must be an emptying out amen for day without us cannot be made perfect amen what we are waiting for now we're with the redemption of our bodies we are waiting for the redemption of our bodies that's why healing was given as a sign that certain body part needs to be healed it's a sign that your body needs to be completely healed in when you are translated it's a complete healing of the body amen [Music] and they did some of them found they didn't even have any oil in the lamb but his lamb trimming time so he says the seventh not the sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom comets in the seven ones there was a cry amen rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found that it didn't have any oil in the lamp but it's lamb swimming time it's malachi 4 time it's promised luke 17 time all those prophecies that perfectly set forth in order is talking about that time when the word was coming so what hour is it now now it's over where the body is risen up where he says now thou must prophesy amen now is the hour where you become the final voice in this final age this is the bride ministry now amen it was a time for a luke 17 30 ministry it was a time for malachi 4 ministry you know the time for revelation 10 7 ministry but now it's the hour for revelation 10 8 to 11 ministry amen remember the body has risen yes amen amen it's a very late hour we're living in i hope you can see where i'm getting at amen we have received such a great message amen imagine this the world didn't see this but from eternity seven angels came down and formed the trouble from eternity yes and man when a debate would god man want to debate with the supernatural when you debate with the supernatural in you are missing the promises of god [Music] a prophet that was four days before the foundation of the world yes it was on the scene yes the denomination all of them call him a great prophet because they don't call him the prophet for the messenger of the age but they don't recognize him as a prophet as a word prophet remember this was the word prophet yes amen this prophet had to bring the word for the age yes they recognized him just because of the miracles because of him deserving the hearts and thoughts of people that's how they recognize him but we recognize him because the message that he brought because we know that all of us come in because we are stimulated by the revelation of the world and that word still stimulates us yes because we know the only thing that energizes us is the stimulation of revelation that's what makes you jump for joy that's what makes you shout amen get what makes you want to dance that's what makes you want to praise him that's what makes you want to sing amen when you have that stimulation of revelation when you are drunk in that spirit you've got to have something that's happening within you yes and you show it on the out outside amen you can't hold it anymore because why bubbling from within you amen and one of these days is very word that's bubbling in you that word that's in you oh this body can't only anymore he's just gonna translate amen amen he's gonna take you to another dimension amen he said if you're in christ there's not a word written in here but what you believe it i don't care what anybody else said we don't care we don't care what the skeptics say that's right amen yes in fact if you've got discernment and you've got revelation you will see how inferior the theology is and the reasoning is to the wisdom of god yes they are so inferior they might buy out the scriptures that sounds profound to some certain people but those that are full of the holy ghost will not be astonished by them yeah but when you speak mystery truths amen to people that are eating from the garbage can because they're in spiritual famine that's right because why under joseph stores money there was food amen yes so when you are speaking mysterious troops after they they're trying to find a spiritual meal from a garbage can from those joel osteen from the tv jigs from all these people that are receiving them and you speak this mysterious truth they are astounded by your script sorry about the things that you are saying they are astonished by what you are saying amen because what you are saying makes sense what you are saying ties up with events that are happening right now what you are saying he ties up with modern day events made clear by prophecy hallelujah amen that is why you still have to prophesy amen that is why until the lord comes you have to go out and prophesy again amen amen and you're not talking about just the they got those preachers to preach the fundamental gospel we're talking about preaching this gospel this message man this message that's revealed to you when the the opening of the world we're not talking about a closed book we talk about preaching from an open book that's what the world needs to hear until the lord comes he's preaching from an open book don't be ashamed to preach from an open book don't be ashamed of that you received because let me tell you something they might come and buy the entire bible to you they might come and explain to you the greek meaning they might explain to you the hebrew meaning but they cannot explain between the lines amen because why to you it's revealed plainly yeah he said i don't care what anybody else said and that good then god makes that thing manifested because you when he pours the spirit upon the word what happened just like putting water on any seed it will live and bring forth [Music] amen so we spoke about enoch then there was elijah amen being a prophet the word of the lord came to him yes he knew on a certain day he's going to be translated he didn't just walk he wasn't walking from one position to another no it was a strategic work hey man he was strategically working from one location to another amen until they had to even tell you to cross over jordan but it was strategically walking we're not just walking anyhow inappropriately amen amen we are positionally placed in this land to the holy ghost amen and we are walking along this journey amen what we walk into we are walking to the rapture we are walking through this rapture journey yeah and we are strategically walking what i'm talking about there's a progression in the world the time it was revealed from 1963 from the opening of the world to 2022 there has been a progression in the world hallelujah what i'm trying to say as light is needed light is given revelation upon revelation upon revelation yes amen the word is becoming more clearer the word is unfolding more and more yes because why you need it for this hour amen so he says now it's the first thing it's astounding the first thing is a trumpet a shout and a voice in a trumpet shout a messenger getting the people ready the second is the voice of the resurrection the same voice that loud voice insane john 11 38 to 44 that call lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the dead to be caught up with it now watch this thing takes place the next is what was it a shout a voice a trumpet now he says the third thing is a trumpet which always at the feast of trumpet is calling the people to the feast and that will be the bride's supper the lamb supper with the bride is in the sky you talk about wearing the seventh dimension amen where we go to meet in their wedding supper now we know just like our weak culture that feast amen there must be another rapture after us we know that three raptures have already taken place enoch in the bible elijah in the bible in the time of jesus yes that's history now amen this one to take place with the bride to go to the wedding supper amen and after us there must be moses and elijah after the preaching of three and a half years they were killed the body were lying in the streets and people were watching over them for three and a half days are they watching them through the media why they wasn't touching the body maybe it was no man's land maybe at that time there was some they couldn't interfere with his bodies we don't know but that's what the bible said everybody was watching them [Music] and then they raised up and they were absolutely amen so we are living we are living in this hour where the bride is risen up again so much to take place now amen the one that already was descending with a shout you must go and call out the sleeping sins amen because they're sitting at six dimension we are waiting for jesus to come amen they're waiting for that amen and we are waiting to see them yes we are waiting to have fellowship with him amen so what happened in between what happens between you must be the manifestation of christ upon the earth christ must be reproduced through you amen amen that's the in between you become a living apostle great in all of all men you are prophesying in this hour from an open book amen to whom the word of the lord came to not for the public show but he come to you personally come to say i'm coming to take you away like how the rancher's son went and told at a certain time you don't get ready you just be ready but you're going to be my wife and she was scorned that she was mocked out to all the cousins to all the denominations why she is keeping herself for this man yet he's never taking so long to come there's so many other people that she could go through she could go to any denomination man why she keeping herself with one man but she knew she had a promise once he gave her that word she received it within a heart and it settled nothing could take it from there he just settled in a heart that this man promised me is coming to take me and he will come and she waited patiently because why she was portraying those virtues amen faith patience virtue tempered godliness amen she was portraying those virtues amen because that's the man that's going in the rapture comes to that stature of a perfect man coming to an image of christ because why that's the image that has to go that's the one that that's the body of christ that god wants he's perfectly man amen she was the one just playing the virtue and said no i will be faithful this man i will wait i will rely upon his word and she waited but there was a time when she heard that chariots and then she heard the losses amen and she was swept off the just like that one of these days amen oh there's going to be a dimensional change one of these days osteoporosis will drop down natural bodies amen the celestial and the terrestrial must come together and we must come to our glorified state because why we are changing from glory and to glory amen as we eat of this word changing from glory unto glory amen to whom the word of the lord has been revealed he says but the word justified is though you've never done it at all that's right so when we look at our lives and say but how i'm going to portray these virtues i'm going to do this i'm going to keep this world what does justified me he said that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from sin yes so it's put in the book of god's forgetfulness is the only one can do it yes amen you see he's not lying upon you he's done the work of redemption for you yes don't let the devil come and remind you that you're a failure because of your ethnic nature yes bring that flesh the only way to bring the flesh under subjection is subdue the evil one in the battleground of the mind amen amen defeating right there yes and say the blood of jesus cleanses me from all sin yes amen justified means i haven't done it in the first place what are you talking about he said we can we can forgive but not forget eyes could forgive you but i'll always remember you done those evil things then you're not just you're forgiven but in the height of god the bride is justified she never done it in the first place amen standing there married to the virtuous son of god never sinned in the first place why she was foreign she was trapped into this thank you lord you didn't ask to be born in this world speaking lying shamefully you come into today because of the sin of man amen but you have the opportunity to receive the new birth amen to have a nature change amen that's why jesus simon verily really i say unto you unless you are born again you cannot see the kingdom of heaven he said truly truly i say unto you until you are born again you cannot understand the things that the kingdom of heaven you won't understand whatever revelation of it it will never be revealed to you because why it's not a natural thing it's not a natural you come by the natural bird but this is a supernatural birth amen this will make you because that's how we come the royal seed of abraham amen through the royal seed we come and that's why all abraham's blessings still pertain to us because we come from that royal seed and now we come by a supernatural birth amen and now we are identified with christ and that's why you could cry out i'm no longer that son and of charles and ella branham he recognized i am a son of god he says but in the sight of god the bride is justified she never died in the first place amen standing there married to the virtuous son of god never sinned in the first place why she was for dane she was struck into this and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleansed her amen aren't you glad that the blood cleansed us amen amen because why the blood is in the world it's the washing of the waters of the world you come through the washing of the waters of the word and she stands there virtuous she has no sin on her at all therefore the message calls the bride together see the shout amen and the trumpet the same one with a loud voice he screamed out with that shout voice and worked lazarus with a loud voice he cried lazarus come forth see and the voice wakes up the sleeping bride the sleeping dead and the trumpet with the son of god and when it does it calls always a trumpet called israel to the feast of trumpets which was the pentecostal feast the great feast in the sky and the feast of the trumpets and now a trumpet do announce a calling together come to the feast now that's the lamb supper in the sky now watch the assembling together and the bride the feast of the trumpets the wedding supper amen that's what we call too [Music] that was going to happen one of these days we've received the shout we've gathered into way to his provided place amen under his great message then there must be a calling there must be a calling there must be an emptying out of the sixth dimension that same voice that the level from there must call out from the sixth dimension amen but the scripture i read they would have there must be a rising of this bride rise to authority rise to a position rise in power yes and when she is coming to that readiness then there must be an emptying out amen two thousand years ago it happened so there must be a spiritual application to it it must happen to this bride when she is rising up in power there must be an emptying out then the feast of the comfort is the winning supper amen and they and us will go you meet the lord in the air the same one that's descending shout voice trunk does all three things that appear to us amen the ones that yeah amongst us amen who's the one that keep revealing the word week after week it's the holy ghost amen he said now notice we have three witnesses three is a witness now we've already had three raptures in the whole testament because he's putting remember jesus is old and new yes he is taking out the old testament and the new testament did you know there is a witness now watch enoch was one elijah was one and jesus was the other one now jesus being the key stone now he bear record he was the keystone between the old and you because he had to first die and then rapture he died come to life and walk around here with us and then was raptured up because he was a keystone that tied the two together after his resurrection and rapture looked after he did that and proved that the old testament day we all know enoch was translated we know elijah was taken up by a whirlwind right in a chariot of fire and jesus died buried and rosed up and lived here on earth and then was raptured up the keystone there is three to bear record is that right amen he says three years happened in the whole testament of them prepared who the word of the lord came to see what you're saying three years happened in the whole testament of them prepared who the word of the lord came to did the word of the lord come to us in this day you said because we received the word that come in this day we have received the message a message that come that was stored up we have received it amen amen and the word of god came to enoch it came to elijah it came to them the word was jesus amen and it comes to us he says the old testament saints has gone into his presence paradise done away you know the temporary darling and the old testament saints ascended up at his loud voice when he screamed and give up give up the ghosts because the sacrifice the propitiation of their sins that they had waited on believing that perfect lamb was coming they offered the sacrifice the lamb and when he died and yielded up the ghost he screamed with a loud voice and the old testament saints awoke watched the shout and the voice over there the same thing that is coming yielded up the ghost and when he did the sacrifice was perfect and paradise emptied out and the old testament scenes came to the earth again walked around on earth and entered in him at his rapture david said over there lift up your gay everlasting gates and be ea lifted up he left captive captivity captain giving gifts unto men and the old testament saints reigned with him they said who is the king of righteousness the lord of god mighty knows mighty oath here they come in marching jesus led captivity captive and here he comes with the old testament saints and went in the new gates up there and said lift up your everlasting gate and be lifted up and let the king of glory come in the voice come from the inside said who is the king of glory the lord mighty in battle the gates flew open and jesus a conqueror led captain captain then that had believed on him and the word has come to them amen we who believe on him and the words that come to us must go the same way amen there the old testament says laying in there waiting he led captive captain the sinner and i took the old testament saints and went in there is one rapture already passed he said the next rapture takes place is for the church the bride to be resurrected to be raptured into glory we which are alive and remain that is the bodies left on earth will not prevent or injure them which are asleep so the trumpet of god shall sound first the dead incredible rise and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them he said lookie just in closing now the second resurrection first one is past the second one is iran right now will come to end now now the third one is the two witnesses yeah that's right because moses and elijah must die then they must be raised up revelation 11 11 which these are the ones that turn back with the spirit of christ to witness to the jews that joseph did to his brethren and remember the dead bodies lay in the street for three and a half days and then the spirit of life came into them and they were raptured taken up into heaven amen to whom the spirit of the lord come to amen not a public show not for the whole world but to whom the word of the lord came to amen we thank god that his word has come our way amen we thank god then he open our eyes of understanding while the age has been blinded amen and now the blind is leading the blind but we thank god because he said amos 3 7 surely the lord of god will do nothing except he reveals mysteries to his servants the prophets and he is really secrets to his servants the prophets and he's revealed the secret mysterious truth to us through his servant the prophet amen and we've received it like john took the book ate the book wasn't easy to digest wasn't easy to eat because why there to be a change amen we have to die to self yes we have to give up the things of egypt and we have to start this exodus journey and now it is this journey has been going on till we now come under our land of inheritance and we are rightfully possessing the land amen we are rightfully possessing the land because why the whole oath of heaven is behind us and we are saying just like joshua and caleb when the others said we are like grasshoppers in front of all these giants denominations and so forth we are saying we are more than able to possess the land amen thank god for the reading of his word amen amen [Applause] amen the rapture is not for everybody but to whom the word of the lord [Music] amen revelation is sovereign that's something to be boastful on it's it's when revelation is given to you you recognize his grace amen then you recognize the grace of god then you begin you begin to appreciate his word you begin to love him more amen and you begin to say and to recognize that there's nothing that you

being established in the present truth amen amen not on a word of a day gone by not in the days of luther in the days of wesley amen not in the days of the pentecostals but in the days of the voice of the sounding of that seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished amen and aren't you glad that that is past tense now because it is finished amen amen we can stand like jesus when he had finished his work he said it is finished we stand as the bride here testifying that revelation 10 7 it is finished and we are products of that message and that ministry amen and i believe the shout is still gathering the living sayings amen some people want to progress to the voice ministry but the voice the shout is still calling the living saints amen amen if we've gone to the voice ministry then the dead in christ should have already arisen amen because that's what the voice ministry does it resurrects the sleeping saints but we are still in the shout amen amen still
