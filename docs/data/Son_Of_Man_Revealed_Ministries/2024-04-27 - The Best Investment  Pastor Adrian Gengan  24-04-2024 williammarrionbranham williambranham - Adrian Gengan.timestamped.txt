[0:47] that reach out and take your word by
[0:48] faith oh God we come to you now and we
[0:50] trust you we commit the service into
[0:52] your hands of everything that will be
[0:54] said and done in Jesus name amen amen
[0:57] amen amen I greet you all in the
[0:58] precious name the lovely name of our
[1:01] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's
[1:03] good to be found in the house of the
[1:04] Lord to give him praise Glory and Honor
[1:07] amen hallelujah let's turn to our Bibles
[1:09] amen praise the
[1:11] Lord Matthew chapter
[1:14] 24 verse
[1:19] 35
[1:22] amen Matthew chapter 24 and: 35
[1:27] reads Heaven and Earth shall pass pass
[1:30] away but my words shall not pass away
[1:33] amen
[1:35] amen Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[1:38] but my words shall not pass away amen
[1:42] why will it not pass away amen because a
[1:45] man is only as good as his word amen if
[1:48] you can't believe a man's word then it's
[1:50] no good so when the word of God Is
[1:52] Spoken it becomes law it becomes God
[1:55] himself in word form amen that's what
[1:57] the Bible says the word was made flesh
[1:59] and dwelt amongst us amen hallelujah so
[2:03] we believe the word of God Amen with all
[2:06] our hearts Heaven and Earth will pass
[2:07] away yes amen and then let's turn to
[2:10] Luke 10 verse
[2:20] 42 so this is giving the story about
[2:23] Mary and Martha and you know they were
[2:26] in the house and how Martha was
[2:27] interested in serving the lord Jesus so
[2:30] she was interested in serving the word
[2:34] amen she wanted to see what she can do
[2:37] for the word yes amen but here Lord
[2:40] Jesus says but one thing is needed
[2:42] needful and Mary had chosen that good
[2:45] part which shall not be taken away from
[2:47] her amen so Mary chose the word amen
[2:51] hallelujah amen amen you may be
[2:54] seated praise the Lord amen
[3:01] amen for little title we call it the
[3:03] best
[3:04] investment amen amen the best
[3:08] investment
[3:10] amen the best investment we can make in
[3:12] this life that's what we are looking at
[3:16] amen we can we can talk about many
[3:18] things in this life we can try and give
[3:20] one another advice about what is good
[3:22] investments in this life but the best
[3:25] investment we can make is the word of
[3:28] God amen amen so we read the scripture
[3:31] Heaven and Earth will pass away but my
[3:33] words shall not pass away and we know
[3:37] that the first Bible the first word was
[3:39] written in the heavens so God is saying
[3:42] even that will pass away some people
[3:45] dedicate their lives they invest in the
[3:47] study of animals in the study of the
[3:49] moon and the stars they invest the
[3:51] entire being into studying those things
[3:55] but the Bible says what does he profit a
[3:56] man if he gain the whole world and he
[3:58] lose his soul
[4:00] so the best investment is what we are
[4:02] looking at amen I want to tell you at
[4:05] the outset if you have made a wrong
[4:07] investment it's time to pull out your
[4:10] investment and reinvest amen amen amen
[4:14] while you can't reinvest amen amen it's
[4:17] time to reinvest so we see we're living
[4:19] in a time where the thing needed is
[4:21] perfect Faith amen we can't move on
[4:23] without perfect Faith amen we'll die in
[4:26] Latos without perfect Faith that's why
[4:29] the message of the hour came Amen to
[4:31] equip us and to give us perfect Faith
[4:34] amen the prophet says we need to get the
[4:36] church into Apostolic times again amen
[4:39] where we see the move of God in the
[4:41] church
[4:42] amen and he says we want to see more of
[4:44] it amen he says we want it to flow to a
[4:47] point where it can help others how many
[4:50] if you know Jesus said amen the prophet
[4:52] is teaching us the gift is not given for
[4:54] ourselves the anointing is not given for
[4:56] ourselves amen it's for the work of the
[4:59] ministry amen hallelujah we can't live
[5:02] selfish lives and just enjoy the
[5:04] blessings and the anointing and the
[5:06] Revelation upon Revelation and not be
[5:08] concerned for the Lost Jesus first
[5:11] message was repent for the Kingdom of
[5:13] Heaven is at hand and his disciples amen
[5:16] we in the last day must amen Echo that
[5:19] message the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[5:22] hand amen hallelujah hallelujah amen so
[5:26] we said the thing needed is faith and
[5:28] not just any ordinary Faith amen but
[5:31] perfect Faith amen hallelujah perfect
[5:35] faith in this hour a rapturing faith why
[5:37] do we need perfect Faith to change these
[5:40] old bodies amen amen hallelujah God
[5:44] didn't say don't worry just go along
[5:46] living a good old church life and one
[5:48] day I come and I'll change your
[5:50] body God is requiring amen a faith part
[5:53] from us and we know that Faith cometh by
[5:55] the hearing of the
[5:57] word so that's why the best in
[5:59] investment is the word amen every
[6:02] investment must give off a return
[6:06] hallelujah amen so one of the returns we
[6:09] are getting of hearing the word is Faith
[6:12] being generated Faith being produced you
[6:16] can listen amen hallelujah to latan
[6:19] church preachers and they'll only raise
[6:21] your level up to a certain Faith amen
[6:24] but if you come under subjection of
[6:26] Revelation 10:7 and Malachi 4:5 and the
[6:29] five form Ministry that's associated
[6:32] with that Ministry you are going to be
[6:34] built up in perfect
[6:37] Faith hallelujah amen
[6:40] amen praise the Lord amen so we see
[6:44] there's a sequence of events we've got
[6:46] to establish our investment in the word
[6:48] of God when we establish our investment
[6:51] in the word of God we are getting
[6:54] Faith yes than you Lord amen hallelujah
[6:59] amen and the Bible says that Faith
[7:01] worketh patience so we're getting
[7:04] patience amen God is equipping his
[7:06] people amen but that's not the only
[7:09] thing what did he say at the last Church
[7:11] age Amen to you that
[7:14] overcome and now if you know that faith
[7:17] is the victory that overcometh this
[7:19] world the only way we are going to
[7:21] overcome this world and this latest and
[7:24] condition is by faith hallah amen amen
[7:28] hallelujah so what are we what are we
[7:31] investing in what are we investing our
[7:34] time in what are we listening to amen
[7:37] when we saying Faith cometh by the
[7:38] hearing of the word hearing by the word
[7:41] of God what are we investing are

[7:45] to amen what are we listening to what

[31:33] body Jesus turns and he says who touch
[31:36] me and the disciples are even puzzled
[31:38] and they say Lord there are so many
[31:40] people around you what do you mean who
[31:42] touched

[34:43] and believe your word speak that you
[34:46] have already received that what you have
[34:48] asked for amen amen praise the Lord the
[34:50] centurion's faith was similar amen what
[34:52] was he speaking about he was giving
[34:54] Jesus a big lecture about faith and how
[34:56] it works
[34:59] yes he was telling
[35:02] Jesus and the Bible says Jesus
[35:06] marveled that this man knew about
[35:08] Authority and the powerful word he had
[35:11] seen it work in caral men he had seen
[35:14] men in our Authority speak a word and
[35:16] our soldiers would give their lives for
[35:18] it yes the authority coming through a
[35:22] man's word am and he knew if there was a
[35:25] greater power and he knew about Jesus
[35:28] Healing The Sick yes and he said if you
[35:30] can do
[35:31] that when he first told him I'll come to
[35:35] your home Jesus said I'll come to your
[35:37] home the word told him I'll come to your
[35:40] home
[35:41] yes hello the word told him I'll come to
[35:45] your
[35:49] home the Centurion said the Gentile Fai

[36:09] negativity over your situation speak the

[36:17] am and the Bible says amen his servant
[36:20] was healed the selfs hour you see that
[36:24] was a physical representation of what
[36:27] the power spoken word can do amen it can
[36:29] change the heart of God yes Jesus was
[36:33] even ready to go and make the journey
[36:34] with
[36:36] him but he changed what Jesus told him
[36:39] he would do same like ezekiah wasn't it
[36:43] a prophetic word that came to him get
[36:46] your house in order you're going to
[36:50] die most of us will just accept things
[36:53] amen we get a truth think we think we
[36:56] did amen praise the Lord prepare
[36:59] everything I'm going to die amen praise
[37:02] the Lord I don't think we say things
[37:04] over the I don't think I'll make
[37:09] it not here now not sure we got people
[37:14] of Faith here but generally people start
[37:16] to say things like this in the
[37:18] flesh amen especially if they want to go
[37:21] on a pretty party they don't appreciate
[37:23] me now
[37:25] [Laughter]
[37:28] amen hallelujah praise the
[37:31] Lord so we start to speak things if we
[37:34] don't realize it's having an effect
[37:37] because our words create an atmosphere
[37:39] right you know your doubt and your worry
[37:41] is creating an atmosphere all around you
[37:43] wherever you go you make people
[37:47] anxious amen you know what I'm talking
[37:49] about you know when your boss comes in
[37:50] there how anxious you get they create an
[37:55] atmosphere amen
[37:58] hallelujah praise the Lord what was a
[38:01] woman doing when she was speaking must
[38:02] Jesus bear the cross alone and all the
[38:05] world go free the atmosphere in the
[38:07] house was terrible was a drunk man
[38:10] throwing plates of
[38:12] food violent
[38:14] temper but she started to use the words
[38:17] to change the
[38:19] atmosphere change the
[38:21] atmosphere the situation may look
[38:23] impossible in your
[38:25] life your obstacle your Mountain
[38:28] but use the word of God to change your
[38:30] atmosphere some people are very
[38:34] pessimistic
[38:36] amen you know Jesus teaching about
[38:39] Investments he's teaching about how he
[38:41] was
[38:42] given they were given talents yes they
[38:46] went there some went to invest it but
[38:49] some did nothing with that they didn't
[38:51] invest it so in the same way I don't
[38:54] want to go into that story but you know
[38:56] that some people got the the word of God
[38:58] the talent is given to you yes but they
[39:01] don't invest it
[39:03] yes
[39:04] yes the best investment is to put the
[39:07] word of God in your heart speak it in
[39:09] your mouth best investment it will
[39:11] change your life hallelujah amen praise
[39:14] the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen so
[39:18] the identification of a True Believer
[39:21] what is the identification of a True
[39:23] Believer brother Bram says in perfect
[39:26] faith
[39:28] that Jesus relied in what the word said
[39:31] about
[39:33] him Jesus relied on what the word said
[39:36] about him and he said if he relied on
[39:39] what the word said about him he says
[39:41] can't we rely on what the word says
[39:43] about us if it says amen I want all that
[39:47] the word says about me how many if you
[39:49] want that I want to rely on everything
[39:51] the word says about me this isn't the
[39:54] message perfect Faith now he says can't
[39:56] we rely what the word says about us amen
[40:00] so the identification of a True Believer
[40:02] is one who is able to believe in the
[40:05] word of God and what the word says about
[40:07] him so what is he doing he's recognizing
[40:10] his day and his message and a True
[40:13] Believer is one who recognize what the
[40:15] word says about him and not what the
[40:18] word says about that person hello not
[40:21] what the word says about that person but
[40:23] what the word says about me amen amen
[40:27] because Malachi 45 is not about William
[40:29] brandom Malachi 45 is behold I send
[40:33] you amen I'm sending you we focus on the
[40:38] end part of the scripture Elijah the
[40:40] prophet but the scripture is addressing

[40:47] you the scripture is talking to you is
[40:50] it talking in a third person or in a
[40:52] first person come on somebody got to

[40:56] in a first person
[40:58] God Almighty amen behold I send you
[41:02] brother raes behold I send you brother
[41:04] Tyson I'm sending you Elijah the prophet
[41:07] and his ministry is going to turn your
[41:08] heart yes amen back to the faith back to
[41:12] perfect Faith amen
[41:15] glory thank you
[41:18] Jesus amen so the one that believes in
[41:21] what the word says about him the one
[41:23] that believes amen that everything in
[41:25] the Bible prophesied about me I see it
[41:27] coming to
[41:29] pass amen some people are more
[41:31] interested in the post man more
[41:33] interested amen
[41:36] hallelujah fixed on El fixed on
[41:39] [Music]
[41:41] Ela fixed on
[41:43] it and they're just like a tree planted
[41:47] By the
[41:49] Waters they believe they shall not be
[41:52] moved
[41:54] amen
[41:55] hallelujah they don't want to has
[41:57] subject himself to a five-fold Ministry
[41:59] a Ministry that is spoken of in the
[42:01] Bible in Ephesians 4:11 Ministry spoken
[42:04] of in the Bible that this ministry is
[42:06] going to bring you up into that stature
[42:08] of a perfect man amen no man shall
[42:10] attain the stature of a perfect man if
[42:12] they are not under a fivefold Ministry
[42:14] I'm going to say it again no one in this
[42:16] age will come to the stature of a
[42:18] perfect man if they are not under
[42:20] Ephesians

[42:39] God has sent the Bible says when he
[42:42] ascended on high he gave gifts unto

[42:50] we don't want what God sent because we
[42:53] don't like God's gifts yes amen people
[42:57] people don't like God's gifts even Jesus
[42:59] said God's gifts are not recognized in
[43:01] his own country people don't like their
[43:03] own gifts they like International gifts
[43:07] amen you know there shops all around
[43:08] here but people don't want to go shop

[43:28] all of
[43:28] [Music]
[43:32] China amen if you can do that in the
[43:36] natural why are you restricted to some
[43:38] denominational idea about the Bible when
[43:40] you can have all of the
[43:43] Bible amen people want to pick and
[43:45] choose amen hallelujah so the believer
[43:48] is the one who becomes the words in the

[43:55] the words in the book amen the one that
[43:58] is able to take the book and read what
[44:00] the scripture says about him amen this
[44:03] day the spirit of The Sovereign Lord is

[44:28] about
[44:31] him you read the word like it's talking
[44:34] about
[44:35] you amen so the believer is the one
[44:38] where the words of the book become alive
[44:40] amen that's why Christ had perfect Faith
[44:42] because he recognized what the word said
[44:44] about him it's it's that simple Church
[44:48] Jesus had perfect Faith because he
