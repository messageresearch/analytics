p.m. amen so you can be blessed with that service amen so let's turn to our Bibles Luke 10:1 17 amen Luke chap 10:1 17 so Jesus had sent the disciples away on a great missionary trip and he equipped them with power and now they coming back and the 7 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven amen but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven amen amen St John 6:37 amen John 6:37 says praise the Lord all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out amen praise the Lord one more scripture in Philippians CH 4:4 Philippians 4:4 says rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice amen hallelujah rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice for title this morning amen I want to speak on rejoice that your names are written in heaven amen amen Rejoice that your names are written in heaven you may be seated amen hallelujah amen there's many things in this life to Rejoice about amen we can achieve material things in this life we can achieve amen things in our careers in our schooling life academic life whatever we set our mind to Sporting Life and we can really Rejoice around those things amen you find people that get behind a particular team and they go Friendzy and they Rejoice around that amen it's what makes people happy amen so what are you rejoicing about amen we that are called out under the seventh Angel's message under Malachi chapter 4 amen under Revelation 10 what are what are what is the point of our rejoicing what is the source of our rejoicing amen the reassuring words of our Jesus is that it's not left to ch yes Amah now there people in the world today you can go to most churches and ask them is your name written in the book of life and they may I have a doubt amen they may not be sure but if we read the scripture carefully the Lord Jesus now if you find there we know that the 70 turned and walked away but the prophet tells us with the 70 was the 12 yes right because if you put that scripture back up Luke 1720 amen you'll see when Jesus is saying not withstanding in this Rejoice that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven now what was Jesus telling them don't Rejoice because you have power to remove illegal squatters demon powers that are there illegally yes amen amen I have given you authority over these things and we find people build their Ministries around how they can cast out Devils amen about praying for the sick they build the entire Ministry and reputation just because demon powers illegal occupants are cast out and the entire life goes by that reputation that this man is able to cast out Devils this man when he prays for the sick the sick are healed but Jesus is saying don't rejoice in those things don't build your ministry around those things amen he's telling them rather Rejoice be happy be glad because your names are written in heaven am and you go to the next verse you'll see the Lord telling the disciples now amen praise the Lord amen amen then he turns to the disciples and he's telling them that only their eyes are open to these things he said blessed are your eyes amen amen it's not for everybody amen hallelujah amen in the next verse brother Hallelujah he turns to his disciples and he tells them don't rejoice in these things but he says to you to you it is given to understand the mysteries of these things amen praise the Lord hallelujah have you got the verse amen Jesus rejoice voice in his spirit and he said I thank the father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and reveal them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight next verse amen all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and to whom the son will reveal himself amen amen hallelujah amen so we see the takes a particular type of rejoicing and your life will never be the same again if you only realize that your name is recorded in heaven and that you were predestinated from before the foundation of the world amen amen people don't want to live up to the acknowledgement that they were for ordained for this hour amen predestinated for this hour that your name was put on the book and you have an obligation to live up to amen you must live up to the standard of it Hallelujah people are getting so caught up in just living an ordinary life on the earth amen and don't want to take pay attention to God's word and what he's calling us for amen God wrote your name now how is it possible for us to know can we say with certainty that our names are written in heaven we know that when the title deed was taken when Adam lost it in the Garden of Eden Adam had no intercessor there was nobody to plead his case Adam was left the Judgment Bars were set and Adam had to face the king Adam had to face God Adam had no intercessor to plead on his behalf because there was no blood shed yet amen amen yes so God took a lamb as a as a symbol and a type and he slew the lamb amen and his wrath was appeased and he took the skin of the lamb and he wrapped Adam and Eve so we find here amen that in the Book of Life we know that the the Bible speaks about the book of life and the prophet says it's not two books even though he says sometimes you can call it two books amen he says there is your two books one of them is the Lamb's Book of Life your name is on there predestinated on there amen you can't take away nothing it was forain to be there but the regular Book of Life can be taken off at any time you don't repent it's off anyhow cuz you're you're going to stand judgment now in no other age could you see your name in the book I'm trying to show you what Jesus was telling them that they couldn't really see it Jesus is telling them Rejoice that your name is written in heaven amen but where was the book the book was in the hand of the original owner in heaven if the 12 disciples wanted to see the name in the book there was no book for them to look upon but the Lord Jesus is telling them Rejoice that your name is written in heaven amen amen and all they had was Jesus word to tell them that you are called of my father my father has chosen you and to believe the words of Jesus that the name was in the book amen amen amen hallelujah in no other age could people see the name in the book but now that the Seven Seals are open amen now that the Lamb's Book of the the the section of the Lamb's Book of Life is brought into view amen and brought down to the Earth amen the ones whose names are in the book can now recognize themselves amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen given to ones those that names are in the book now for us in the message it seems that we have found some comfort in thinking just because we have accepted the message everything is fine God predestinated us we can't rejoice in our Salvation amen people find it hard to rejoice in their salvation you know there are billions of people in the world today and their names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life but your name and my name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life God T of you amen God predestinated you this ought to bring rejoicing to our hearts this ought to bring joy to our hearts knowing that we are saved we have passed from Death unto life amen oh amen hallelujah there ought to be such a rejoicing amen there ought to be such a Hallelujah there ought to be such a praise in the house of God just because of Salvation just because our name is written in the book we don't have to wait for the song leader to work us up amen we don't have to wait amen for the preacher to work us up and entertain us amen but we Rejoice because our names are written in the book Thank You Lord hallelujah thank you Lord when demon powers leave a body those things amen we ought not to be jumping up and down and shouting for those things Jesus is saying don't Rejoice over those things hallelujah thank you you find the the CEO of a company when he gives an instruction and all the employees follow it out he doesn't go around the office jumping and shouting hey everyone's following my no he knows who he he knows who he is he knows he carries an authority yes amen you know who does that you know when you make somebody monitor class monitor the class monitor does that they Rejoice around those things but who has real power thank you the teacher yeah amen the one with real Authority teacher hasn't go around the school I told the children do this and they they were doing it but you might find the monitor doing it you are not a monitor amen amen you possess the power of Heaven backed up behind you amen every word that you speak You've Got The Power Of Heaven backing you up the Holy Ghost is here to enforce a claim amen praise the Lord so we are redeemable attributes amen that God saw it fit God looked through his for amen God had for knowledge God is omniscient God is omnipotent amen and he looked down through time and he saw you and he wrote your name in the book praise the Lord hallelujah amen praise the Lord here in the message of San Church H he said say Jesus comes from heaven with 10,000 * 10,000 of his Saints and the Bible says that the heavens was empty for the space of half hour you know that's a seven seal where is this big fellow God then is in Christ and as we overcome by the Holy Spirit and as we overcome by the Holy Spirit like he had we will sit with him as he takes the eternal Throne of David to sit and Rule with him just like he did up there with power and authority over all the Earth and the Earth is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God to be manifested God's son because after all this world was not given for God to control amen thank you because after all this world was not given for God to control let's notice that right who is god of the earth amen amen man that's his domain all everything in the earth is subject to the man to sin he fell to Christ's redeeming power he comes back again that's right because the Earth belongs to man stop being a wimp you are created to be a god of the Earth amen amen have a backbone amen hallelujah amen it was given amen hallelujah because the Earth belongs to man it was given to him he was ruler over everything and all Nature's groaning waiting for the time when the sons of God will be manifested again amen oh me my manifestation of the sons of God hallelujah amen now in the Book of Daniel chapter 12:1 we are speaking about the names in the book and how having this revelation of our names in the book we can't remain like Ordinary People am amen amen we ought to be thrown into a worship State amen hallelujah a state of worship a state of continual worship to thank the Lord and rejoice what is rejoice let us be glad let us rejoice amen hallelujah it looks like sometimes the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ is so sad to get married to him it's so sad it's like they have an arranged marriage and they don't want to go to the altar amen we should enjoy our Christian we should enjoy our Salvation amen and at that time Michael shall stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book amen Michael has come in this time to deliver the names that are found in the book amen amen hallelujah that's what Revelation 10 is all about that's why he's coming back with the open book amen amen the book contains the mystery of God but while the mystery of God is being revealed names are being called out you are coming out of your denominations you are coming out of your Traditions you are coming out as sons from Sons of men to sons of God Amen when when the mystery of God is revealed Hallelujah you say I don't he my name every time you hear the mystery of God being revealed you are hearing your name amen God is calling your name amen think about the time now in Revelation 19 put up Revelation 19:7 it says let us rejoice and let us be glad and give honor to him amen for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready am now you know that the prophet tells us that your name reflect your nature your character hallelujah amen a name reflects character of a person that's why Jesus when he was on Earth he was called Jesus he was given a human name because it means Jehovah savior amen hallelujah the name was fitting to his role he was Redeemer amen praise the Lord amen now how many of you know that in a marriage ceremony there's a changing of name yes yes Hallelujah there is a changing of name so when he's saying let us be glad let us rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb is come amen your name was changed amen amen you were married to the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen you have another husband the first husband is dead you have a new name hallelujah amen then you can't live your ordinary life you can't go around living an ordinary life you carry the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah now you don't Jesus doesn't just come and give you Authority like he equipped those 70 and went now you carry the authority even to off the kingdom I don't know if you're hearing me this morning amen you that are married to the Lord Jesus Christ your name has been changed amen you carry the merried name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and all of Heaven amen he's here to back you up when you speak here on the earth amen hallelujah your name is Mrs Lord Jesus Christ amen Bless The Name of Jesus bless the name of Jesus hallelujah amen amen amen oh hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen I pray that you come up higher this morning amen and start to Rejoice around the things of God amen hallelujah amen yes thank you some of you can feel the representation within you some of you can feel the theophany tugging Amen in your heart to know amen without a without a shadow of a doubt your name is on the book amen you are not doubting you are not second guessing amen yes praise the Lord there are people whose names are not in the book The Bible talks about them Hallelujah I pray you're not one of them this morning amen hallelujah I'll show you your position in the Eternal part before you came to the Earth and I'll show you your position and how you're worshiping and and and you see now if it's reflecting now yesk doesn't match it will reflect in your worship Hallelujah must reflect in your worship must reflect in your life amen what did John amen when John saw his name in the book yes you know he couldn't help but Rejoice what are you rejoicing about amen I want you to know John was a part of the people that Jesus said Rejoice that your name is in the book the same John is now transported to Heaven amen thank you Lord hallelujah praise the Lord imagine that John needed amen Adam needed an intercessor Adam had we just read there Adam had control over the Earth but Adam could not Ascend the Heavenly realm Adam could not go before God and plead his case amen praise the Lord yes he couldn't go there he needed a man who could have send the heavly Realms and bring back title deed amen Adam couldn't do it his flesh had failed him Hallelujah he had become a mere man and death would take his life the moment man sinned God created a dimension in heaven amen hallelujah Paradise because man was never meant to die Hallelujah when man died he separated from his theophany he theophany went to this Dimension and he was left as a human on the earth left as a mortal man to die amen praise the Lord but God Amen it says the prophet says now that he was looking for a man God was looking for a man amen we find here he tried to find it in Moses he tried to find it in the prophets he tried to find it amen to all the prophets of the Old Testament but there was nobody worthy to take on the sin of man amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen Joseph the perfect type of our Lord Jesus Christ was still flawed yes Hallelujah you find there even Joseph right there in the lowest of the prison house was typing our Lord Jesus Christ amen Jesus died with two thieves one on either side Here Comes The Butler and the baker amen the Butler and the baker comes into view yes amen and Jesus is telling them amen take drink this is the cup and one is a cup Bearer one of them is a cup Bearer before the king and he's saying take eat my body broken for you one is a Baker and who dies the baker dies to symbolize the body broken but the one who's bearing the cup the blood ascends up amen because the blood is in atonement the blood still speaks the blood had to go up to the king to speak and make intercession thank you hallelujah thank you Lord so Joseph was a perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and it was the blood the one that was holding the cup that saved Joseph from the prison house because he told the king yes about somebody was a able to interpret dreams amen amen hallelujah yes thank you so we find Joseph still maybe was a good type amen but he still could not express it in fullness Hallelujah so when when when Satan caused Adam to fall amen God continued in his creation trying to find one man who would live by every word his first man failed and this man would live his time and in his age that he lived in Hallelujah so we find amen God now had tried every prophet and he knew amen that none of them would fit Redeemer none of them would fit was fit to give their lives so God created a body for himself the word was made flesh and it came and dwelt amongst us amen and that body of Amen Tabernacle God himself all that was in God heting to Christ amen and when Jesus Christ shed his blood on Calvary amen hallelujah the blood was our atonement the blood paid the price for man's sin paid the price from Every Man's sin beginning from Adam to the last man on the earth pay the price for our Redemption there's no sin too great that the blood can't cover don't let Satan lie to you and tell you that you've sinned away amen that your sins though it be as Scarlet though it be as crimson amen it shall be as white as snow if you accept the Lord Jesus Christ accept his blood amen Satan still some people they come to Christ they accept amen Christ they accept the blood but then they still want to go and crucify themselves over things they've done in the past Satan comes to bombard you with memories Satan come to bombard you and tell you you're not good enough remember this time you did this and you did that amen hallelujah you remind Satan of the blood and you remind Satan of the Cross and you tell him Jesus Christ died in my place amen yes I was a sinner yes I did those things amen but now my plate my slate is clean amen the cleansing power of Jesus Christ has washed me and made me whiter than snow do you believe that about yourself amen that all sin is gone thank you Jesus praise the Lord thank you Lord amen let us rejoice let us be glad amen hallelujah I wonder why it seems that forgive me for saying this why it seems that that the message people are so sad can't enjoy their salvation Hallelujah can't be joyful people and happy people amen they hold the greatest Treasure of the message of the hour the greatest message to strike the Earth and sometimes you walk around so sad so gloomy amen no joy walking around like undercover agent amen you know when you got something of value you'll tell everyone about it amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord amen there's a fountain bubbling up amen a spring from inside amen you know what you're carrying is eternal life yes Hallelujah some are saying leave me to myself amen just leave me coming to church just leave me as a good church member the message of the hour is not designed for church members the message of the hour designed to call Sons and Daughters back to their position amen amen hallelujah within a church if you want to remain a church member then you can remain a church member but the message of the hour has come to call Sons and Daughters back to their full potential amen oh the manifestation of the sons of God Amen Hallelujah we are here to equip that people amen we are here to bring them back into the image of Christ thank you Lord when John saw his name he could not stop rejoicing could not contain his worship to see your name means that you are seeing everything that belongs to you coming back to you man was separated from ever beholding what's what's in the book man was separated from seeing what was contained in the book amen amen praise the Lord when you are hearing the message of the hour you are hearing hearing the title deed being read out unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom and people are so bored with the revelations that came out of the message of the hour they wonder what does the Seven Seals mean what does the symbols mean what does Christ The Mystery of God mean what is who is mesic mean what is recognizing your D and message mean what is future home mean the mysteries of God hallelujah hallelujah am oh it sounds foreign that sound you know what that sounds like some foreign titles that I used to hear about when I was a child growing up because I've never read those books I've never refreshed myself with that messages I'm just relying on the pastor to come and preach because those things are find no treasure in those things when brother Brandon was preaching those Mysteries he was not preaching it in simple form he was preaching it so plain and simple that you can understand these Mysteries you see when when Satan will come now and tell you that there's no value to those Mysteries what is he doing taking away your inheritance yes amen he tells you there's no value to those things you think the prophet go God wasted his time taking the prophet to meet seven angels coming back with a message and then then from 63 to 65 he's revealing the mystery of God Amen and then we can't find Value in those things tell me how to make money tell me how to get rich in this life don't tell me about uh you know what whatever will be will be if I was predestinated to be there I'll be there just let me live here with my five b amen just let me be happy here don't interfere with my life my family life [Music] unfortunately if you have that kind of attitude you will have no representation up there you've got to prepare to live that's why Ephesians 1 is telling you that you are seated together in Heavenly places before Esther could Ascend the throne she went through a training ground this is the Bright's train ground to live in Heavenly places so that one day we can finally go to Heavenly places amen yes amen your name on the book means you are joint tears with Jesus your name on the book means you have legal rights over the Earth again you must take Dominion back at this time oh I I'm afraid there are so few that will take Dominion back at this time there are so few that want to take Dominion back over this time there are so few that will answer the the the creation's ground for the manifestation of the sons of God your name in the book means you were selected chosen predestinated to be an overcomer of this age you see the prophet tells us that God he's not somebody he says like he'll take you and push you through a pipe yes and call you on the other end and say welcome over good job good job yeah if you want to have victory in this hour if you want to overcome the AG one thing is required you must fight amen you must fight for every inch of ground Joshua was put in the land and they didn't go to rejoicing that they were in one part of the land they had to fight for every inch of ground you have to fight for every inch of ground amen you're living with that sickness why aren't you fighting Amen to overcome it you say how do I fight fight by confessing the word of God Amen why you throwing away your marriage fight for confessing the word of God the word of God can change any situation the problem is you don't believe it amen put your confidence in the word of God your child is a drug addict your child has gone away from God put your confidence in the word of God believe the word of God speak the word of God amen amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord take back fight fight Church of God fight for every inch of ground fight amen that you can win Satan doesn't want you to attain salvation Satan doesn't want you to attain back your god-given Authority amen so he's all the hell amen all the darts and the guns and the swords of Satan's kingdom are trained against you you don't feel it amen but your prayer life is gone say has stripped you from your power Satan has stripped you from reading the Bible you say I'm a good Christian you're a terrible Christian if you don't read your Bible and pray every day somebody's going to tell you and it'd Rather Be Me from the pilit if you don't read your Bible and pray you're not a Christian yes amen hallelujah yes praise the Lord amen amen cutting your prayer life is cutting off your oxygen cutting off your access to the Heavenly realm to call back Supernatural forces on the earth what was Daniel doing he prayed for skill and understanding to re to read the scriptures Lord I'm reading the things prayer contacted Supernatural the supernatural world and brought back angels to the Earth and Gabriel comes there I have come to give you skill and understanding you know you're a Son of God you can call God on the scene amen in your worst trouble amen hallelujah praise the Lord oh praise the Lord you know I must tell you I enjoy preaching on Wednesday nights amen and you know why I love preaching Wednesday nights amen sometimes maybe I should just get visiting preachers to come preach Sunday mornings and I'll just preach wed Wednesday night because you don't know what kind of atmosphere is here on a Wednesday night you don't know what kind of anointing is here on a Wednesday night amen praise the Lord it seems like every Sunday there's a struggle amen because demon powers are afflicting people people come into the service with demon powers amen they can't Rejoice at the word of God that's a reflection that demon powers have oppressed you amen hallelujah the only seal you know is that your lips are sealed say Jesus break the seal from my lip you broke all Seven Seals how about you break the seal from my lip amen yes but you know what God won't force you to praise him God won't force you to Rejoice around his word amen the reason you're in your situation is and the reason you'll get worse in your condition is because you cannot find it within you to give God praise amen you cannot find it within you to break out of your situation amen you are stubborn you are arrogant you are prideful am you know a son and daughter of God can't help but lose himself in Father's presence oh yes amen amen hallelujah he just raises his hands and he worships the Lord when the preaching of the word comes forth he don't care who's sitting next to him he starts to Rejoice around the word of God Amen don't matter this is my father's house amen yes amen you know why some people behave like this in in their father's spiritual father's house go watch how they behave in their father's house at home having a pretty party everyone must feel sorry for them they scream and shout about everything grow up amen you're a man amen be a man amen God called you to be a Son of God God didn't call you to be like the world who are you packing yourself against yes why you behaving like that amen you find no victory in the house of God Amen because you got no Victory on the inside hallelujah praise the Lord amen so there was no man on Earth to ascend the Heavenly realm amen but only Jesus Christ could do it that's why when Jesus Christ amen paid the price he ascended to the heavens he was after one thing alone amen amen he must pay the price he paid the price now you must intercede for seven Church ages amen seven Church ages of intercession this denominations know nothing about yes that's right Hallelujah this is revealed to a special class of people that Jesus ascended to the Heavenly realm as high priest to intercede for seven Church ages 2,000 years have pass amen and he intercedes for every name that's in the book Hallelujah and he must stay there until every name is fully revealed until every name is redeemed so through seven Church ages amen hallelujah he's sending his Spirit to the Earth amen and he's picking up Paul irenius Martin columa Luther Wesley amen hallelujah they are connecting with the word with a word with a word with a word they are recognizing the part of the word for their age they are living and manifesting the word for their age Luther reads the just shall live by faith he picks up one scripture and he goes out with a message and he's able to withstand the Catholic church amen Wesley picks up another word amen sanctification the blood of Jesus and they go out with the word recognizing their part of the ministry and going out amen the restoration of the gifts zza Street outpouring they recognized it amen and they went out with a word amen each one recognizing a part of their Ministry I'm telling you we're living in a time and season now it started with William brandham amen who started to recognize he part of the word that I must become the full word image amen the formed word image just justification alone is not good enough for me

marriage of the Lamb has come brother Brandon will tell you he won't marry anyone beside his own nature reflected in them so Jesus is looking to marry a feminine form of Jesus someone who's in his nature and his likeness and in his character Jesus won't marry anybody who is not reflecting his nature and his character so let's look at so's name now amen in the bridge between seven Church ages Seven Seals we'll read this I want to show you what seeing John seeing his name meant for him and if we are saying we see our name in the book what should it mean for us when all creation was groaning

the foundation of the world he took the book opened the book tore of the seals and sent it down to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people am pay attention to that now when brother brandom is revealing the book to you revealing the Mysteries yes there's something happening on the back side of that yes it's calling out your name yes amen amen so what he does brings it down to the Earth to

home and all where were you when the church gathers together sleeping where were you where were you when the church gathered for prayer meeting I watching Netflix where were you where were you I was pretending to be sick where were you I don't know I didn't tell the Deacon where were you nobody knows where you were where were you where were you when the S Stars sang together and all the sons of God whispered for joy and all the sons of God shouted for Joy where is your shout yes amen there ought to be this is the Cry of the redeem a shout amen amen even God when he's coming to call you amen hallelujah the living Saints he descends with a shout hallah he doesn't descend with a whisper am is's descending with a shout put a shout within you God comes with a shout amen all sons of God have a shout of Joy amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord amen isn't he a good god yes amen isn't he a loving Heavenly Father amen amen praise the Lord amen only attributes only his attributes Will Rejoice at this time only his attributes can have that rejoicing what Jesus spoke about not up one day down one day amen not going amen by your feelings but going amen that your name is written in heaven I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this narrow way for the comforter abides with me I know who I am as a son of God what's your expectation in this life what is your expectation in this life what are you attaining to what do you want for your life I'm not talking about your natural things now I'm talking about spiritual you where do you see yourself in 5 years if there's a 5 years where do you see yourself how spiritually strong do you see yourself have some ambition have some goal amen amen father I want to be in your image and your likeness oh God I'll start by reading your word because your word will shake my mind your word will bring me into alignment with your thoughts and your plans for my life hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord God is only poent he's only present no man can come to Jesus except he calls him amen praise the Lord just want to find a place to close you now amen now you want to Rejoice praise the Lord so if we go to question and answers on the seals 114 there you'll see on that notes amen 114 they asked the prophet a question is it true that every born Jew every Jew born since Christ that came into the world is to be saved the prophet says nothing will be saved only those names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world now the prophet is very strong in his teaching because the Baptist believe the day you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ that's the day your name is written in the book so the prophet is correcting that error and he's telling them the word Sayers your name was put there from before the foundation of the world now this is the part I want to get to the the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name watch this is the point I was telling you earlier the book is not calling out your name you're not going to hear jayen you're not going to hear Caleb what are you going to hear but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names you fully understand that now so what is he saying is when the mystery of God is being revealed when you are hearing the mysteries of God your name is being called out your name is being called out now you know why you can respond to the word brother brandom's teachings and the denominations can't because behind the mystery there's a call of your name behind the mystery there's a call of your name amen behind the mystery of serpent seed you can hear your name being called behind the mystery of Hallelujah Hallelujah because you can't tell me you supernaturally heard your name being called but you came up because of the mysteries of God what was it the attributes of God were being revealed in the back part of it thank you Lord on the front of it you were hearing amen the mysteries of God all the titles but on the back side of each you were hearing the names being called hallelujah amen hallelujah see not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names so you see when they are rejecting the Mysteries they are rejecting their call right amen and what happens brother brandom says yes there's a book of life he says there's only one book and he transitions into the lamb section right he says but there is some that got but there's some that got their name written on the Lamb's Book of Life when them seals are thrown open there they see the name there we got that second seal but there some that's got their names written on the Lamb's Book of Life and when them seals are thrown open they see their name there Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit speaks to them they come you can't keep them away amen no one can no one they're coming anyhow because you're leading them like like you did those little birds and the sheep and the cattle Thou Art God some Instinct Instinct that them animals have that they know that they must get away now watch what brother BR is trying to do here he's trying to show you that animals have an instinct but you have a theopen body Hallelujah animals have an instinct but you have a theopen body you are hearing from your theophany amen hallelujah amen that's one quote and the next one he says I'm trusting I'm I'm I'm one of those that's going to find my name tonight behind that seal Yonder that was put on there from the foundation of the world something struck my heart and I'm standing Lord is it me are you calling I want you to reveal you see brother raes was sharing with me he jumped into a comi some some probably invited him they were going for a prayer meeting with rames and he jumped into a Combi and he was listening to their conversation and they were speaking about Footprints in the Sand of time and he said you know what I read that somewhere amen something connected years earlier he had read was was it Prophet visit South Africa hey 1973 he read that book probably forgot about it the book but sitting in the combi he heard them speak something am and it took him back years to what he read what was it deep calling to the Deep wasn't in a preaching service you know normally if you're the first time person in a Combi you're not going to be talking much you're going to be listening to conversations amen praise the Lord amen their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen so can you see your name in the book a good sign that your name is in the book is if you receive the message of the hour only the sons of God whose names are in the book can respond to the call of the message of the hour because the shout has come gather the names that are found in the book amen amen praise the Lord amen I want to show you four things quickly just read this four things quickly that you need to understanding about the book of life right brother Bram is going to detail this very quickly we'll try and go through it as quick as possible then we'll close right so he's saying first of all we all we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was forn and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation this is you now whose names are in the Lamb's Book of Life amen you can never come into condemnation she can never be in judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her right blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world even the angels her name each of her members was written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so that's one section how many of you identify with that section amen amen that's the ones whose names were written before the foundation of the world there's another class now he says secondly there's another class their names are also written in the also in the book of life and they will come up in the second Resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous have spoken of in Matthew 25 in this class also are those who do not worship the Beast or become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life Hallelujah that's the second part now in the book third part of the book these are the Borderland Christians that we saw in Israel coming out of Egypt these are the names in The Book of Life and their Works written in in the books these having failed to obey God and being void of the spirit so they don't have the Holy Spirit though even the signs and wonders were amongst them so you see these are your faith healers and all of these people right will will have their names removed from the book among this group will be the ones like Judas who who though entirely void of the spirit but are religious will have manifestation in their lives and though on the books were not the elected in him such also are balum with that group so here's the fourth part now fourth and finally are the ones whose names have never been or will ever be written on the books such are found in Revelation 138 Revelation 178 all them that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life slain from before the foundation of the world he's quoting all the scriptures there amen you see none of these will be placed on the records of life I am not saying there's no record of them no doubt there's some kind of record of them but not in the records of Life the purpose of existence has been dealt with slightly in the rest of this book but we can add two more scriptures so he gives you two more scriptures there right some will be offended by what I have set forth because they fail to understand understand the sovereignity of God who sets forth that God is God because he is God one cannot defeat his counsels toward his will and purpose he is omnipotent ruling all Affairs and doing whatever he will with all his creation because all we created for his good pleasure so he details us now and he says thus if God so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept them it also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of the book of life but in the full knowledge of God they were to fall and have the names removed we must accept that and if those whose names were never placed upon the record of life we must also we must accept that also and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white Throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of God whom are his Brethren then we we we must accept that for who knowe the mind of the Lord that that he should instruct him rather let us be subject in faith to him who is our father and live amen now maybe in the course of the sermon you would have picked up if your name is in the book amen amen amen you would have picked up somewhere in that sermon if your name is in the book amen and if your name is in the book I want to reiterate Jesus says Rejoice because your name is in the book Let's stand and give God praise amen praise the Lord Hall amen hallelujah Rejoice Rejoice because your names are in the book amen praise the Lord oh Hallelujah think about it when the names was revealed what a rejoicing time in heaven amen can we match that on the earth can we match the praise can we match the excitement yes can we
