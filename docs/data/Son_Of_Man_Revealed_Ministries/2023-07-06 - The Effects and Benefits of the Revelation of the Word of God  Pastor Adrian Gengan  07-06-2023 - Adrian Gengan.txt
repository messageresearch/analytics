them at the point of their need we ask his Blessings Now the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen everybody blessed to be in the house of the Lord amen amen listen to 1 John chapter 5 verse 4. amen we're just exhort for a few moments amen and then we can get together and pray amen the prophet always spoke about a Wednesday night prayer meeting amen hallelujah so we look forward to that time where we can come and they call it a corporate prayer amen amen the body of Christ praying together amen 1 John 5 4 says for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen amen so we know that faith is our victory amen we can't be short of faith that's one thing we will make sure that we are growing in our faith amen amen who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God Amen may the Lord blessings to the reading of his word you can be seated amen Hallelujah you can also turn to Revelation chapter 2. amen Revelation chapter 2 verse sorry Revelation 3 and verse 20. amen Hallelujah some scriptures with Caleb you'll just get on your Bible Software amen Revelation 3 and 20 just want to get some context to this end time amen Revelation 3 and 20 says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will suck with him and he with me so somebody tell me who's standing at the door just for the children now they don't know who's standing at the door amen can everybody say we've got a lot of children here now we need to teach them who's standing at the door Jesus is standing at the door and he's knocking and Jesus is saying if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he would me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne amen so we find the one that is going to open the door he's the one that is familiar with the voice because nobody opens the voice to his opens the door to a stranger amen we teach our children do not open the door to a stranger's voice that is why the leadership Church can't open the door to Jesus amen they don't know his voice amen didn't Jesus say my sheep know my voice and the strangers they will not follow amen so that's why they can't open the door to him is because they don't know his voice yes amen doesn't he say in the days of the voice amen so they have not recognized the voice so they can't open up the door to him so even when they heard the voice of the seventh angel they shut the door yes amen amen and he says to him that overcometh will I grant you sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne now all of us have to overcome things in this life amen we are all going to a testing time we live in in this latest here age of gross Darkness amen we are all coming now to the time where we can say like no flesh will be saved it's preaching to the Lost amen so there's gross Darkness all around us and some of the things we have to overcome amen we know it's the lust of the eyes lust of the eyes amen lusting amen for things that we see lust of the flesh and the pride of life if we can summarize it in those three things but you can detail each aspect and see how the people are lusting after material things amen not only they are lasting up to material things even in the spiritual kingdom of God they're lusting after gifts amen amen the lasting after gifting and they love sing after the power of God yet they don't want to obey the word of God Amen so we all go to overcome something in this life some trial that God has given us amen some testing amen because these trials come to perfect our faith amen amen they come to give us patience they come to build our character amen hallelujah so we find here that every one of us is overcoming something amen every one of us will have to face the tears amen God's not going to push us through a pipe and bring us the other side and say Well done my son you made it through amen hallelujah brother Caleb we can go to a slide now the prophet he gives us great insight into his own into his own life amen and he exposes some of his flaws and some of his mistakes so that we can learn let's go to slide number 14 there we find in in the message standing in the gap [Music] the prophet wants you to go off the field and he wants you to become just the profit in the wilderness and come out whenever he's thus said the Lord and preach you know what he says now uh I'll be there okay thank you sorry maybe 15 it's like 15. he says why do you wait for me to move you every time you move right the Lord is now speaking to the prophet and he's telling why do you wait for me to move every time you move where is your reward then I sin and then he said do you remember what brother Robertson told you in his dream of vision that you had done like Moses you forgot the feeling of your people you forgot the call that I called you to amen he says I let the sick lay but he had that saved the Lord I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not to that's wrong now we are the bride who has that saith the Lord amen amen we've got to believe that we have that's it the Lord in the sower we are the entire people we are finishing the race we have been commissioned to go we have that's it the Lord so we can't be lying around waiting we've got to go amen hallelujah we can't let the sick lay amen we've got to show the power of God amen hallelujah amen oh blessed be his name there's one more quote I want to read the brother Caleb amen amen maybe we can get it from yeah praise the Lord amen let me just find the slide amen hallelujah amen you love the Lord amen amen maybe we can if you go to standing in the Gap I'll give you the paragraph for the thing it was a beautiful quote I wanted to read to you amen maybe I don't put it onto the slide Hallelujah amen standing in the gap if you get it tell me then I'll give you the amen which one to call up you got it amen he says if God pushes a man through a pipe amen he says if God pushes a man through a pipe and he don't move at all until God tells him there is no faith connected with it amen there's no faith connected with it if God is just going to bring you through all your trials will not put you through trials amen he says there's no faith connected to it that's right amen so there's no Victory there's no overcoming power it's god pushing you to something and it's built the ministry to a place where there is nobody can say one word against it but from ends what let me first speak to you in the name of the Lord before you listen because I must go out by faith I must do it by faith whether I think it's right or wrong or what some are waiting for the portals of Heaven to open and say my son go forth and do this you have been commissioned in this hour amen yes yes amen because I must go out by faith I must do it by faith whether I think it's right or wrong I do the best of my choosing and then go do it yes yes who's choosing I do the best of my choosing and then go do it because it hasn't been because it hasn't been wrong is because I've waited to till he told me to go I've waited for him so it wasn't me it was him amen so then he goes into that other quote where we read that amen so if you go to 121 there you'll see there what he is telling him and this is what we are called to now because remember we are connected with the prophet's Ministry yeah amen anyone who received the prophet's message must bear the fruits of his message yes amen amen hallelujah he said but so remember he wants you to be like the Old Testament prophet he says but that was the Old Testament Prophet you've been called to a much higher office than that amen amen stop trying to be like Ruth stop trying to be like Esther stop trying to be like Mary if you go to a much higher office each one just playing a part of you and entirety they reveal the mystery of you but you are the entirety of the mystery amen amen you've been called to a higher Ministry a higher office you have more gifts beside that yes come on now you have more gifts beside that amen you were called to pray for the sick and preach the gospel and you're in the apostolic form you know of greater things many great gifts why do you wait for me to move every time you move where is your reward amen hallelujah pride of Jesus Christ why do you wait amen speak and go forward amen why Christ speak amen yes amen don't worry God's word he's gonna back it up you go forth and you speak in his name amen amen you go forth and you pray for the sick amen hallelujah amen you go forth and you apply the word by faith amen these signs shall follow them that believe amen you don't care if there's a Red Sea in front of you you see the word by faith and you go forward amen it's up to God Amen to recognize your faith and bring it to pass yes amen fight is the victory that overcometh this world Amen and and all of this this is what I'm my title is the effects and benefits of the revelation of the word amen because all of us now are trying to overcome something but what is the value what is the effect and the benefits of the opening of the word what effect does it have on us to overcome this age to overcome this time to sit with Christ in his throne there's a word that's been released to us and every time you hear the word of God faith comes by the hearing of the word amen this is not the word of Luther's age it's not the word of Wesley's age it's not the word of the early Pentecostals amen this is the word amen of William Branham amen the seventh age messenger and his word is revealing and producing a perfect faith it's producing a perfect rapturing Faith amen amen amen we are heading up to a time of the rapture any moment now the dead in Christ shall rise can I get somebody to testify you believe in amen any moment now the dead in Christ shall rise amen amen amen things are heating up now you see amen what man is this according to the these perverted people they call it pride mother amen it started on the 1st of June they got Pride but what comes before fall pride comes before fall amen amen what came before the fall of Sodom yes wasn't it their pride month they were celebrating when the Angels entered Sodom yes amen hallelujah oh bless the name of Jesus Amen but did they burn yes amen at the rejection of those angels message they burn amen but I want you to know the angels are not going to the sodomites the angel was going to rescue Lots amen they're gone against God's natural laws amen they've gone against amen God's word amen the Bible declares that a man shall not lie with a man amen sure amen hallelujah but they have perverted it and now they are trying to impose their will amen even the straight people are fighting for the rights of them amen but if you saw them sign it's Luke 17 shrine amen it's a prophecy amen and we should be rejoicing because amen he said even they were asking him about the kingdom when it's coming he said even as as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be even as it was in the days of lot so shall it be amen so we ride at the brink of time amen hallelujah blessed be his name amen glory to his name amen hallelujah go to slide number four there the prophet is saying who is he that overcometh now we want to overcome The Siege he's saying he that believeth that Jesus is the Christ not is a Christ now but is the Christ he doesn't say that the overcome is one that believes in a Jesus and in a Christ but he believed that Jesus is the Christ one person not two he he is the one who is baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ have you been baptized that way amen amen then we are the ones that overcome that's always defining it you recognize the godhead yes and you are baptized in his name yes amen that's the Revelation that's making us to overcome in this day amen amen hallelujah think about it millions of churches none of them believe the best the God is the way we believe it yes because the mystery of God has been revealed amen and they refuse to be baptized in his name Amen to be baptized in his name is to die to serve that's what baptism does you're dying to yourself that's what a woman does she dies to herself and takes on the name of her husband when we go down to the watery grave amen we are baptized in his name and we are resurrected with his name amen glory be to his name amen we find you in the scriptures Amen brother Caleb if you can go through it quickly amen that there was going to be a word released to the people amen now John the Baptist said behold the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand kingdom of God is coming prepare either way what was his kingdom Jesus was talking about Amen in Luke 9 and 1 you'll find here Jesus Calls the 12 disciples together now Jesus had 12 disciples 12 men that he called commissioned to go and spread the good news of the Kingdom he called the 12 disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases amen amen amen amen and send them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick yes amen you can't preach the kingdom of God without these without power you can't preach the kingdom of God without having authority of all devils they're gonna make you run amen amen you can't preach the gospel without being able to cure all diseases Luke 9-1 amen hallelujah to be able to hello is it the same yesterday today and forever come on now this is the evidence of the Gospel in power and demonstration cure all diseases and in line two he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick amen amen amen Luke 10 and 9. it reiterates and to heal the sick that they are that are there in and to say unto them the kingdom of God has come nigh unto you amen don't just take them the word only show them the power of the Gospel amen and Luke 10 11 now he commissions them further even the very dust of your city amen this is now the people who reject him which cleaved on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be sure of this that the kingdom of God has come nigh out to you but I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that City talking about Sodom amen let's go to Luke 17 and 20 then amen now the Pharisees come to Jesus and demand of him when is the kingdom of God going to come and he answered out to them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation yes yes amen neither shall they say Lo here O Lord there for behold the kingdom of God is where the kingdom of God is within you but not everybody will experience at him and you're going to put up John 3 there amen 16. amen John 3 accept a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot see the kingdom of God Amen amen amen didn't Jesus say accept your man be born again he cannot see the kingdom so only born-again people can experience the kingdom of God Amen then he goes on to say except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom so all this time Jesus is prophesying the kingdom of God is coming look what he says here Luke 16 16. the Lord the prophets were unto John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man pressured into it and it is easier foreign amen hallelujah so what is the kingdom of God amen Romans 14 and 17. will tell you the kingdom of God what it is not and what it is amen the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost you can't have the Holy Ghost and not have righteousness you can't have the Holy Ghost and not have joy you can't have the Holy Ghost and be troubled you must have Shalom amen why are you troubled why are you so downcast why do you let the cares of this life choke you up you have the Holy Ghost amen amen we ought to be such a joyful people amen we are too amen have this exuberance within us Amen to join our hearts we ought to be so bubbly amen everyone is so depressed all around us economy down amen this is down that's down this amen we ought to be amen I've got the joy bells in my hearts I've got the joy bells in my heart amen amen hallelujah you sing his praises amen through all the ages amen wherever you go you're singing you're worshiping the Lord you're telling others hey do you know Jesus Christ amen he can set you free amen people are telling you about sicknesses come to Jesus we're not going to give it to you free come experience the power of Jesus amen amen people just want the benefits of the Gospel but the kingdom of God is being preached unto you amen hallelujah blessed be his name amen oh Hallelujah Now where's the kingdom within us but this is the great mystery amen Colossians 1 26 talks about the mystery the mystery which has been hit from ages and from Generations now made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen amen amen somebody tell me how Christ is in US amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Christ is in us then you become the Christ you become the anointed one yes amen somebody say Amen somebody receive it amen you are the Christ of today yes you are the anointed one of the hour amen amen blessed be his name amen glory be to his name amen we are called and we are raised up for this time amen Jesus Christ is coming in this time amen and he's going to find the people who are alive the Bible calls them alive they are Lively stones amen you can't keep them quiet amen they got a Joy about them they got to worship about them they've got an amen a song about them amen they are shouting out and telling the people amen Look What the Lord Has Done amen

time of great trouble amen the world will know what to do economies are shaking politicians are shaking religious religions are shaking but in the time of the midst of great trouble Jesus comes and when is coming there is a resurrection many are to come forth out of the desk and rise with those who are alive but waiting for his return some are alive but they're not waiting for his return some

hallelujah some like the idea of being married without the presence physical presence amen people are not expecting amen people don't have that longing Amen to see the Lord Jesus Christ amen people are satisfied living their life in this earth they're excited with the word amen the excited relatives imagine that case of a husband and a wife he stays in another place and he keeps sending his wife

bold amen the body is aching and and feeling creaks and pains amen speak what you want not what you see amen just command that body amen speak to your situation do you know the spirit man within you is more powerful than this five sins body amen amen hallelujah he says that is the promise to all those who suffer with him here on the Earth all those who endure patiently knowing that God the just judge would reward him they would give up all for him now we have given up all for him amen we have forsaken all for him come on now yes somebody say I forsaken all amen amen even if you haven't forsaken all confess it now amen put your body amen send the flesh man running right now he doesn't like to hear these things amen say Lord I have endured patiently amen I have given up All For You

for it amen yes yes amen thank you Lord now he's not only giving crowns but he says that these in the bride will be paid pillars in the temple of God watch how powerful this is now you're going to overcome but you're going to be a pillar in the temple of God but what is the temple of God Jesus you spoke of his body as being the temple it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God by what the Holy Ghost within us amen hallelujah amen amen are you the temple of God yes amen amen then you have the Holy Ghost within you amen now he's going to make the overcome a pillar in that Temple Hallelujah amen this is the benefit of the message of the hour we have a word to overcome amen and this overcoming power is making us not only to sit on the throne but a pill in the temple yes amen I mean if you love The the apostles the 12 the 11. 12th one is Paul and if you love The Apostles I don't know if you think they were great men of God come on now yeah and if you look up to them and admire them that they were killing me understood yes amen amen amen Hallelujah but watch out now the prophet will equate but what is a pillar a pillar remember what he said you are going to be a pill in the temple Fallen everyone you are going to be a pillar the one who overcomes what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up the self-superstructure right yes but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us right and he said but maybe I got my slide here yeah uh 12-12 I think you had the slide mixed up so we had to pull in the temple we got the Holy Ghost within us he says praise God that puts the Overcomer right in with the apostles and the prophets with the apostles and the prophets for it says in Ephesians 2 19 now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building quickly framed together growed onto a an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom you are also builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit yes that very verse 22 says that we are built together with him everything went through the door and Jesus is a part of that body or Temple amen amen now when God puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of the foundation group what is he doing you are part of the foundation group then the gospel say that the gospel is built on the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets you are part of that as a pillar amen when God puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him part of their Foundation group what is he doing he is giving him the revelation of the word and of himself amen now you see the benefit of the message of the hour the revelation of the hour the third pool anointing amen the opening of the word is giving you a revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and the prophets had didn't he come to turn our faith back yes yes so he's given us a word to turn our feet back and oh Hallelujah I hope you're getting what I am saying amen you are as important as all the apostles you are appealing the temple of God amen amen yes blessed be his name Matthew 16 17 is that one way he says flesh and blood is not revealed it amen Upon This Rock he says there he is in that word there he stands no one can get you out of it you're a pill in the temple amen hallelujah people want to be police in the church a local church I'm a pillar in the church since 19 footstep I was a pillar in the church amen people want an Earthly recognition but you're a pill in the kingdom of God you are immovable yes unshakable you remain no one can get him out amen hallelujah amen isn't that a word that we need amen hallelujah because that's what Christ has made us to be amen hallelujah thank you know who we are in Christ amen Christ has made you a pillar Christ sees you as his Apostles amen a pillar in the temple amen nothing could shake you nothing can move you in this time amen amen let me if you feel that way yes amen I mean if you feel your faith is building up now amen that the Lord has been doing something in your life and building you up building you up amen amen amen you are the super Church amen I'm if you can feel a super anointing come upon you amen hallelujah we ought to feel that way we are to be so enthused about the things of God Amen Hallelujah every day amen we are to be in anticipation of what God is doing amen we are to be looking forward to what is God is doing amen sure we have natural needs that we need to take care of Amen but don't let that be the ultimate priority amen just do those things amen then focus on God amen if you can while you're doing those things think on the things of God hallelujah amen oh bless His holy name amen amen that's what he's given us in this time amen faith is the victory that overcometh the world the effects and benefits of the revelation of the world it's come to give you overcoming power amen if faith is the victory what is faith faith is a revelation amen when Revelation come from through the message of the hour the message of the hour amen I believe they're switching now I was actually chasing that if you notice I was rushing because I said when the power goes off that's a sign for me to close and then we're going to pray didn't I say short exhortation amen and I am I know God said he's not a man that he should lie but I am a man and I don't lie amen I mean if you want me to be true to my word oh I see you're disappointed you want me to go on Amen another half an hour amen hallelujah amen but now as pillars in the temple of God as Overcomers you got to see yourself as already overcome remember Faith he's saying those things that you want not what you see you already overcome already see yourself crowned with righteousness already see yourself perfect already see it amen and with that we want to stand together I told you I'm just exhausting tonight amen to get our faith to a level yes and tell you that you are the pillar in the temple amen in the body of Christ you are such a pillar yes Christ has given you the benefit of being with the apostles and the prophets made you a pillar in the temple of God he's made you an overcomer he says Not only would you sit on my throne but I've made you a pillar amen we always say oh when we get to the other side we're going to talk to all the apostles we're going to talk to all of them but you know they want to come talk to you refuse to open the door Amen in an age where they refused to open the door you open the door to him I don't know if you know that's a mystery there in Revelation 3 that there was a people who opened the door amen and Christ came in and he suffered them amen amen and that's how they were all able to overcome is because it was he in them we are not going to overcome Legacy on our own stream amen amen amen and you know where we need to overcome I mean if you want to know where we need to overcome the jeopard do we have a Maria we don't have a mirror we can pass it around and you look because you are not a one-part being amen you're a three-part being yes yes but the flesh will try to obstruct you from being powerful in the kingdom of God yes amen every time you want to go pray every time you want to read the word spend time with the word the flesh will say no come on now I'm tired I want to sleep the flesh will say no why you want to do that there now so boring amen but press him didn't we read that that they press into the kingdom amen now Jesus detailed he said I'm sending you out to preach the kingdom but the kingdom is accompanied with what science wonders Miracles these things are normal for us yes amen these things are normal for us we don't hype it up the Bible says this sign shall follow them that believe we don't major on a minor amen but the gospel must be preached with power and with demonstration amen how many of you desire to be used in a greater way of the Lord amen amen only two amen how if you desire to be in a great use in a greater way in the kingdom of God amen amen amen amen hallelujah I believe if we have a desire the Lord can use us in a greater way amen amen hallelujah amen I believe God is doing something in our lives amen I don't know how long you've been in the message but right now you can't deny that something is taking place in your life amen you can't deny that the Holy Ghost is working in such a measure and in such a powerful way and fixing things oh thank you Lord and I'm going to say this way is giving you that rapturing faith to take a translation amen and I told you when we fulfill all our partners nothing left normal scripture to be fulfilled except for the dead in Christ to rise and it's not only here that is happening he was around Durban all of them feeling that pool the pool the pool all of them are talking about amen the third poor word producing third pool manifestations yes there's a pool the Holy Spirit fixing things amen and the power of God is going to fall amen and I believe is falling right now in The Bride of Jesus Christ amen a word she's actually Believing on Words amen yes that's what Jesus said yeah yeah if you say to this mountain the sickness this disease this trouble this problem be removed don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said the bride is actually for the first time I think he's believing a word she's believing what the word is saying about her yes amen oh yes it's maturity amen amen is reminding me every time a seed is sown there must be an Harvest amen amen and they are first fruits yeah then there's the summer fruits and we've been talking about what God is doing in our lives and we can see change in the lives of people changing the lives of Believers a
