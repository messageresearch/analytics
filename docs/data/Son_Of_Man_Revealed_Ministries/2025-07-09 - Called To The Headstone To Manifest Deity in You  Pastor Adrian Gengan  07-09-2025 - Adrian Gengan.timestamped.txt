[9:59] prayer. Father, we thank you, Lord, this
[10:01] morning, we can come into your holy
[10:03] presence, oh God.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, when we come before a holy God,
[10:06] Father, Lord, we realize we are nothing
[10:09] before you, Lord Jesus. And Lord,
[10:11] there's nothing we can do to inherit
[10:13] salvation. Nothing we can do of
[10:15] ourselves, oh God. We are relying
[10:17] totally on what you have done for us. Oh
[10:19] God, we relying on the work that you
[10:21] have done on the cross. Oh God, and
[10:23] therefore we identified with the work
[10:24] which you have done and we are
[10:26] sanctified. We are justified. We are
[10:28] perfected in Christ. Oh God, the one
[10:30] that paid the price for our sin, oh God,
[10:33] the one who shed his blood for us. How
[10:34] we love you, how we appreciate you. Oh,
[10:37] we pray Lord that even this morning the
[10:38] blood will still avail for us, oh God.
[10:41] Lord, may you wash us Lord by the waters
[10:43] of your word and cleanse us, oh God.
[10:45] Make us every with whole, oh God.
[10:46] Forgive us our wrongs, our shortcomings,
[10:48] our faults and our failures, oh God. And
[10:51] Lord, we know the flesh is not redeemed,
[10:53] oh God. But Lord, we are praying, Lord.
[10:55] We we are longing for the redemption of
[10:57] our bodies, oh God. Oh, when we shall be
[11:00] changed into your very own image and
[11:02] likeness, that we adore you and love you
[11:04] this morning. We pray, Lord, that you'll
[11:05] come and speak to us through your
[11:06] precious word. And I pray, Lord, that
[11:08] you'll anoint the preaching. You'll
[11:09] anoint the hearers of the word, oh God.
[11:11] Amen. I pray Lord the Holy Ghost will
[11:13] come now and tabernacle me, tabernacle
[11:15] your people, oh God. And father I pray
[11:17] Lord that Lord even as the word of God
[11:19] is going forth, every need will be met,
[11:21] every Lord answer question will be
[11:23] answered oh God. And father Lord we will
[11:25] know without a shadow of a doubt that
[11:27] you are here in our presence oh God. We
[11:29] invite you sweet Holy Spirit Lord to
[11:31] have the preeminence right now. We give
[11:33] you glory and honor and we bind every
[11:35] work of the enemy. We bind every demon
[11:38] power. We bind and we Amen. We command
[11:41] every demon power to take its flight. We
[11:43] do not give you any authority in the
[11:45] service.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; We ask the Holy Spirit and we give you
[11:48] preeminence right now in the name of
[11:49] Jesus Christ.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; For your glory, for your honor, we ask
[11:52] your blessings. Amen.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I greet you all in the mighty name
[11:56] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[11:58] Amen. It's exciting to come into the
[12:00] house of the Lord. Amen. Knowing that
[12:02] this word that we are feasting on is
[12:03] going to change these bodies one of
[12:05] these days.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're getting rapturing faith
[12:07] by the word that we are feeding on.
[12:09] Amen. And praise the Lord.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I greet you all once again in
[12:12] the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[12:14] Christ. Amen. Everybody good?
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. John chapter 6 and
[12:20] verse 37.
[12:22] All that the father
[12:25] giveth me shall come to me.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. All that the father giveth me
[12:32] shall come to me.
[12:35] and him that cometh to me I will in no
[12:38] wise cast out.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we all read that together?
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. St. John 6:37. All that the father
[12:48] giveth me shall come to me. And him that
[12:51] cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
[12:55] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. The Lord had
[12:58] blessings through the reading of his
[12:59] word.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory be to his holy name. Amen.
[13:05] So I think I need to explain.
[13:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. So this morning
[13:15] we want to
[13:17] speak a little thought.
[13:24] Amen. So remember, brother Joshua's
[13:26] ministering at Tabernacle this morning.
[13:29] Amen. That's why they're not here. Pray
[13:31] that the Lord will bless them this
[13:32] morning. So he's the Jesus our Lord is
[13:36] saying all that the father giveth me
[13:38] shall come to me.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; So it's important where Jesus is.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus is not in the leninian church age.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; So all that the father is going to give
[13:49] him is going to come to him and he is
[13:51] the headstone.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; So everyone that's coming now in the
[13:56] bride age
[13:58] &gt;&gt; must come to him where?
[14:00] &gt;&gt; In the headstone. Amen.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; And all that cometh to me, I won't cast
[14:06] you out of the headstone if you are
[14:08] designed to be a part of the headstone.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; So this morning we speaking on call to
[14:13] the headstone to manifest deity in you.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; We haven't been called to the message of
[14:21] the hour for a picnic.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; We haven't been called to be a part of a
[14:25] church movement.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; But we have been called to manifest
[14:28] deity on the earth.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. All creation is waiting.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Now remember all creation is not doesn't
[14:36] say that all creation is waiting for
[14:38] God.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; It says all creation is waiting for the
[14:41] manifestation of the sons of God.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Because the only God creation will see
[14:47] is God in you and me.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Even though they are crying out for God,
[14:52] the final mystery purpose of God is to
[14:54] reveal himself through his people. So if
[14:57] people want to see God, they can't call
[14:59] him down out of heaven. Amen.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Because he's already here on the earth
[15:04] manifesting himself through you and I.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Now this morning we're going to find
[15:08] there's unbelief in you.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Because what we are preaching this
[15:13] morning is going to expose whether
[15:15] there's unbelief in you and whether you
[15:16] really believe the message of the hour.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; When we say God sent a prophet, everyone
[15:23] believes it.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God sent a prophet.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The opening of the seals, the
[15:28] opening of the word. But let's open it
[15:30] and see what the word says about you.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; And then when you can't if you can't
[15:34] believe and stomach what is being said,
[15:37] &gt;&gt; then that's unbelief.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; And we're going to see if there's
[15:41] unbelief in you sitting in the message
[15:43] of the hour.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we are called to the
[15:47] headstone to manifest deity in you.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Now remember our scripture. All the
[15:54] father giveth me will come to me.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. There's a certain class of people
[15:59] called out of the later age to the bride
[16:02] age to be a part of the headstone
[16:04] &gt;&gt; to welcome back Christ. Now it's a very
[16:07] serious thing because I'm going to show
[16:08] you this quote now and we're going to
[16:10] find here brother Leo. Brother Leo was
[16:12] one of the 10 boys.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; He was involved in recording of sermons.
[16:18] So you'll say he had a great work to do.
[16:20] Right?
[16:22] &gt;&gt; Let's read the quote and then you'll get
[16:24] the context. He's
[16:26] this is in the message 70th week of
[16:28] Daniel. I remember not long ago brother
[16:31] Leo a vision that he had a dream he
[16:34] called it one night when we first met
[16:37] that he saw a great pyramid peak.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; What is he seeing?
[16:44] &gt;&gt; He's seeing a great pyramid peak
[16:48] &gt;&gt; way up where
[16:50] &gt;&gt; in heavenly places. So, he's seeing a
[16:53] pyramid peak.
[16:55] Praise the Lord.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; He's seeing a pyramid peak way up in the
[17:02] air. We are called up to heavenly
[17:04] places.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Right. And I was up there preaching.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Somewhere. And he climbed up to see what
[17:17] it was all about.
[17:19] And when he got up there on top of this
[17:21] peak, why he said way off in kind of
[17:24] silver looking light or like a platter?
[17:29] I was standing
[17:31] preaching to the people and he attracted
[17:33] my attention and I looked around to him
[17:36] and he said, "How did you ever get out
[17:40] there? How could I get out there?"
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is up in the pyramid.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; He's up in the headstone preaching.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, if he's preaching,
[17:54] he's preaching to a people.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; So there's a people that he's preaching
[17:58] to way up in the headstone.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; But here's the part we want to get to.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; I said, Leo, no one can come out here.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; God has to take a man here.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Oh, hallelujah. I'm not called
[18:15] to be a part of the leaders here at
[18:16] church age.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; I'm called to be part of the headstone.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; God has to take a man here.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; God has to hone a man.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; God has to shape a man.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; To be up here
[18:33] now. You're not to come up here.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[18:39] Leo, you are not called to be part of
[18:41] the bride age.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, let's read with understanding.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; There are people that's going to be
[18:49] sealed under the ladian church age
[18:51] &gt;&gt; and they'll be saved under that
[18:53] dispensation.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; There are people called to being saved
[18:56] under Luther's dispensation, under
[18:58] Wesley's dispensation. But Leo was not
[19:00] called to be part of the bride age.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Now, you're not to come up here. You
[19:07] have to go down and witness to those
[19:10] people down there.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; You go and do work. Record the tapes.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Do your part.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; But you are not called to be up here.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; This big pyramid in the air in heavenly
[19:24] places.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; You are not called to be up there.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; You are to go down and witness to these
[19:30] people down there. After you have seen
[19:33] it, that it's the truth. That it's the
[19:35] truth. Leo climbs back down to witness
[19:38] to the people.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's a special class of
[19:43] people that are called up to the
[19:44] headstone ministry.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; We are the connecting stone
[19:50] between Christ and the rest of the
[19:52] church.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Christ has got to fit a people and he
[19:56] can't come down and descend upon the
[19:58] Ladyian church age.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's a group of
[20:02] people being owned up coming to a needle
[20:05] point where the headstone can fit.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; And when we are coming up into his image
[20:09] and likeness, brother Brandham says as
[20:12] we near him, as she nears the headstone,
[20:15] she will be so much in his image.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; She will be the super church, she will
[20:20] be the super race.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Now, how do we become part of this body?
[20:27] And how does how uh brother Brandon
[20:29] change our position?
[20:31] Praise the Lord.
[20:33] Is and here in the first seal, he's
[20:35] going to show us how he's going to
[20:36] change our position.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; So what makes us manifest deity? What
[20:41] makes us manifest and call ourselves,
[20:43] Amen, the bride of Jesus Christ? What
[20:45] makes ourselves son of man revealed
[20:48] again?
[20:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "And and and only is to be
[20:53] revealed." is talking about the seal now
[20:55] to be revealed at the last day when this
[20:58] actual seal is broken. Broken to who?
[21:01] The seal is not broken to Christ.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; He says, but to the church.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Now, when he uses the word church,
[21:10] you you need to get into the spirit of
[21:12] what he's preaching.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Then the Holy Spirit is now wrestling
[21:16] within him and then he's going to change
[21:18] the word church.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be broken to the
[21:22] church world. So watch how the Holy
[21:24] Spirit watch he says broken not to
[21:26] Christ but to the church. Then he starts
[21:28] to speak now. Notice now oh my that just
[21:32] makes me tremble. You can see how the
[21:34] Holy Spirit working there.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; I I hope the church truly understands it
[21:37] what I mean. You people I'm going to
[21:40] call you bride.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; So what makes us the bride?
[21:47] &gt;&gt; The opening of the word. Amen.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; The difference between the church and
[21:53] the bride is that the bride has the
[21:55] word.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; And they have rejected the word.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is the secret of this. The
[22:02] word is in the bride.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; The word is where?
[22:07] &gt;&gt; In the bride.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; As it was in Mary.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; How was it in Mary? How did it get into
[22:14] Mary? The angel overshadowed her. Yes.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; So in this time and season, that's why
[22:19] it's important to connect with the angel
[22:21] of the Lord because the angel of the
[22:22] Lord is here again to overshadow a
[22:24] people and put a word in her.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; We can't do without leadership in this
[22:30] time and season. And our leader and our
[22:33] guide is the angel of God, the great
[22:35] Holy Spirit. Can somebody say amen?
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Now I am the word. If you want deity in
[22:44] your midst, then welcome and receive the
[22:47] word.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Now, we know this Bible can be a closed
[22:53] book to you.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; Without the prophet Messenger.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revealing the mystery of God,
[23:00] without the angel of God here on the
[23:01] earth. Amen. And then what have we got?
[23:04] We've got books.
[23:07] When their eyes were open,
[23:09] &gt;&gt; they knew it. Amen.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Then the scripture becomes alive to us.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; We recognize our day and its message. We
[23:16] recognize our part of the word. So he
[23:18] says, "I am the word." If you want deity
[23:20] in your midst, welcome and receive the
[23:24] word.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; No, pay attention what he's saying. If
[23:27] you want who in your midstity,
[23:32] &gt;&gt; that's God.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; If you want him in your midst, welcome
[23:35] the word.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. The denominational world
[23:38] is saying, "We want you in our midst.
[23:40] Welcome. Welcome.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Welcome, Holy Spirit."
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're singing all of these songs
[23:48] to welcome the Holy Spirit,
[23:50] &gt;&gt; but the word is not in their midst.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Now, you must be highly deceived if you
[23:58] trying to convince me that the word is
[23:59] in their midst.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; The prophet of the age indicted that
[24:05] generation Amen.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; For crucifying the word again.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; So don't none of you tell me that they
[24:11] have part of the word.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; They have rejected the word.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; What they have is an impersonation of
[24:18] Christianity.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; They are jealous and generous.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; But we are Moses. Amen.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are Moses. Hallelujah.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Here. O Israel, the Lord thy God is one
[24:29] Lord.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Receive the word. Don't ever let anyone
[24:34] or anything get between you and that
[24:36] word.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; Hey, don't let a woman get between you
[24:38] and the word.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; Don't let a boy get between you and the
[24:41] word.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Don't let your
[24:44] husband, don't let your wife, don't let
[24:46] nothing get between you and that word.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; Why? We want deity.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; But now we come up to the head, the
[24:59] capstone.
[25:00] And this capstone has a voice and it's
[25:03] shouting something. This headstone. Oh,
[25:06] I tell you, I need grace in my life
[25:08] every day.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you,
[25:11] &gt;&gt; oh, praise the Lord.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; I can't even walk.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Without you holding my hand.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Mountains too high
[25:20] &gt;&gt; and the valley is too wide.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Headstone is coming with shoutings.
[25:27] grace.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, we are so perfect.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; No, all of us needs the grace of God.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Therefore, when he's coming to descend
[25:41] on this capstone, this needle point,
[25:42] this flange.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; There's still doubt and unbelief
[25:49] sometimes.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Think Genesis 18.
[25:55] The Lord himself coming with two angels.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; He's coming to find Sarah. You think
[25:59] Sarah is full of faith?
[26:01] &gt;&gt; It's time and season.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. It was time and season for
[26:05] Sarah to reproduce.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; But she was still found in doubt.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; She was still laughing.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; But the headstone came shouting, "Grace,
[26:13] grace to Sarah."
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Why did you laugh, Sarah?
[26:18] &gt;&gt; I didn't laugh. in the in the face of
[26:20] lying to God. The headstone was crying
[26:22] grace grace. That's why he didn't smite
[26:24] her. That's why he didn't kill her.
[26:26] Amen. In the presence of God, but grace
[26:29] was abounding. Amen. Oh, can somebody
[26:31] give God praise in spite of your
[26:33] failures? In spite of all your lies and
[26:35] all your unbelief, the headstone is
[26:37] coming crying, "Grace, grace to cover
[26:39] all your sin in this time and season to
[26:42] cover all your unbelief." Amen.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Whether you believe it or not, the
[26:45] headstone is here to bring you to
[26:47] manifest the word for your time and
[26:49] season. Sarah had no Amen. No option but
[26:52] to believe the angel's word.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Headstone coming crying grace, grace,
[27:01] grace to you.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; You say I'm full of faults. I'm full of
[27:05] failures. Here the headstone crying
[27:07] grace. Here the headstone crying grace.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why is he crying double grace
[27:14] because some of us are so bad.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Not only do we need another another
[27:19] double portion, brother Caleb, we need
[27:21] double grace.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Seven church ages that may have needed
[27:27] grace.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; But up here in the headstone, the most
[27:30] evil age
[27:32] &gt;&gt; where it's an impossible age to live in
[27:33] the flesh.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Where brother Brandham says, I predict a
[27:39] time where people will be gone totally
[27:43] mad.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; He says they'll be insane.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; I I don't know if you're looking around
[27:47] and you're seeing sane people.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; The world has gone completely insane.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; So it takes the grace of God to keep us
[27:56] sane in an insane world.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[28:02] The headstone crying what? Grace. Grace
[28:05] passed from death and creed into living
[28:07] word. That's the shout.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; The living bread of life.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Pass from death and creed into a living
[28:14] word of the living God.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. What's God's provided plan for his
[28:22] age? How many of you want to know what
[28:24] God's provided plans for his age?
[28:26] &gt;&gt; For this age. Here's the provided plan
[28:28] for this age. His sons in the word age
[28:30] quickened by the spirit. That's dynamics
[28:33] coming on mechanics.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like a spark that's lit off of
[28:38] something to make it alive.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm not a dead word.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; I'm a living word.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time we stop saying, "God
[28:48] sent a message. God sent a prophet. Show
[28:50] me the message. Show me the message. The
[28:52] message must be alive. I must be a
[28:54] living manifestation of the message."
[28:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The message must
[29:00] come out of books.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like how Jesus stepped out of the
[29:04] pages of the Bible. They always spoke
[29:06] about a redeemer. Unto us a son is born.
[29:09] Unto us a child is given. Amen.
[29:11] Hallelujah. He shall be born of a
[29:13] virgin. But one day Jesus stepped out of
[29:15] the pages of the book. Amen. And all
[29:17] that is prophesied in the Bible of
[29:19] regarding you and me. We have now
[29:21] stepped out of the pages of the Bible.
[29:23] We have taken the book. Amen. And we
[29:25] have eaten the book. We have now become
[29:27] the word manifest on the earth. And not
[29:29] only have we become the word manifest on
[29:31] the earth, we are now prophesying again.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Make it alive. Seated now. Where? Where
[29:40] you seated?
[29:42] &gt;&gt; He said, remember what Leo said? I saw a
[29:44] pyramid in the air
[29:46] &gt;&gt; in heavenly places. How can we get up
[29:48] into heavenly places? You must be called
[29:50] there.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:54] So how privileged are we church if we
[29:55] are called to a place and a position as
[29:57] this?
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; You think we are just hearing an
[30:04] ordinary word this morning.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; I challenge you. Go to message channels.
[30:08] Go to message churches and see what they
[30:10] are preaching.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; You'll be able to find those that are
[30:13] stuck in the Leadian church age
[30:15] &gt;&gt; and you'll be able to find those that
[30:16] are called up to the headstone.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; How? By the word that they are
[30:20] preaching. By the way they break the
[30:22] bread,
[30:23] &gt;&gt; you'll be able to identify those that
[30:25] are called up to the bride age. And it's
[30:27] no fault on their part.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; It's just Leo, go back down.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; You are not called to meet the
[30:34] conditions that are required up here in
[30:37] the headstone age.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Your wings won't be able to carry you.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; But blessed are you have been called up
[30:46] to the headstone age. You have wings.
[30:48] Amen. Hallelujah. You know how to spread
[30:50] your wings and fly and soar up in the
[30:53] heavenlies. Amen. To meet the headstone,
[30:55] to meet the bridegroom. Oh, somebody
[30:57] give God praise. Amen. If you know
[30:59] you've been called up to the headstone.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Seated now in heavenly places in present
[31:06] tense.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Ah, I'm seated now in heavenly places in
[31:10] present tense. Yeah. In 2025. Amen.
[31:12] September 2025. I'm seated now in
[31:15] heavenly places in present tense.
[31:18] Already alive. and subject to every
[31:20] promise in the word. Then what does that
[31:22] do? You become a part of God's gene.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; A part of the word.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; A part of
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Shan was singing that song last
[31:32] week. Who I am, Lord.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; A part of his plan.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation
[31:39] &gt;&gt; of who I am.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep singing brother Sha.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Even if you sing every week.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to start to understand how
[31:49] rewards are multiplied in the kingdom of
[31:51] God.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; If you take what God has given you, the
[31:54] gift he's given you, and multiply, do
[31:56] you know how promotion comes?
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Promotion comes from the Lord,
[32:01] &gt;&gt; right? And he's teaching us in Matthew
[32:03] 25, when the master comes, how does he
[32:06] give you promotion? How does he increase
[32:08] you? He sees what you have done with the
[32:10] promise, what you have been done with
[32:11] what you've been gifted.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; And some are investing it week after
[32:15] week. Some are investing it.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Some are exercising it.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Week after week.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; But others given duties, given
[32:25] assignments, given a call, given a a
[32:27] position, just lay down and do least
[32:30] with it.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Then there can be according to the
[32:32] biblical principle, there can be no
[32:34] promotion. There can be no reward.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; In fact, according to the biblical
[32:38] principle, the one who does nothing with
[32:39] the gift, it's taken away.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Go read Matthew 25. That's right. That's
[32:44] right.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; So, whatever God has given you, whatever
[32:48] he's imparted with you, use it wisely
[32:50] for the kingdom of God.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; If you've been entrusted with a
[32:53] position, do all you can and maximize
[32:57] it.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; So, watch now. You being a part of God's
[33:06] gene, a part of the word, other men a
[33:09] part of God's gene seated together.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:13] manifest the entire body of Christ
[33:15] because there's no leaven among you. See
[33:19] what I'm talking about, brother Brown?
[33:20] If there's any browns here,
[33:22] &gt;&gt; lots of browns I see here.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; No leaven among you. Just the word only.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Hey, see these people that are up here
[33:32] in the headstone, there's no leaven
[33:34] amongst them.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but my hands are
[33:37] feeling very cold here.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Is the egg one too cold for you? You
[33:41] okay there? I think this thing is
[33:42] hitting me directly here. But it's fine
[33:45] if the people are comfortable. It's
[33:47] okay. I will long suffer. No 11 among
[33:50] you. Just the word only.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Seated in heavenly places in the door.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; John 10:7.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; I am the door.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Seated in heavenly places in the door
[34:04] where he put his name Christ Jesus.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. No leaven among
[34:11] you. That brings the entire fullness of
[34:13] the godhead bodily among you.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; The last time I read that,
[34:19] &gt;&gt; the fullness of the godhead dwell bodily
[34:21] in Jesus.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord Jesus.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Now he's saying it brings the entire
[34:32] fullness of the body. But Jesus is in
[34:35] heaven.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; But he needs another body. The fullness
[34:37] of the Godhead needs another body.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. So apart in you, a party in you. He
[34:42] said all together bring the full of the
[34:44] worldly among you.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Couldn't do it in L's age. Couldn't do
[34:48] it in Wesley's age. Couldn't do it in
[34:49] the Pentecostal age. But in the day when
[34:52] the sun is manifested on earth in the
[34:54] form of your prophet God all glory
[34:57] promised by Malachi 4 promised by the
[34:59] rest of the scriptures where you worship
[35:01] at the house of God seated in present
[35:04] tense to accepting deity and expressing
[35:08] back the same kind of gift like they did
[35:10] that you identified by your gift.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're identified by your gift.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. Amen.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are identified by your gift
[35:22] &gt;&gt; that you give your entire being to it.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you
[35:25] &gt;&gt; to identify deity.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Then you identify yourself with the
[35:31] deity.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to identify
[35:36] yourself with the deity?
[35:38] &gt;&gt; We're going to find out now and root out
[35:40] unbelief.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:43] Praise the Lord.
[35:46] Man will be manifested, revealed,
[35:48] brought back
[35:49] the church together with the entire
[35:52] deity of God amongst his people showing
[35:54] the same visible signs, manifesting
[35:56] himself like he did in the beginning
[35:58] when he was by giving all you are and
[36:02] what you are to deity himself. Now
[36:04] Christ in this day that we live is still
[36:06] he's identifying himself deity amongst
[36:09] the people. He's still deity because he
[36:12] is the word. Remember we said how are we
[36:14] getting it? The word
[36:15] &gt;&gt; through the word through receiving this
[36:17] word. Deity is within us.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; And can identify itself in you.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Then give your hold to it. Show that you
[36:28] believe it. Give it deity. Believe it.
[36:31] Service and be ready to die out to
[36:33] yourself and your own thoughts. But
[36:35] today it's rejected as it was then.
[36:38] Sure.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; You see, watch how when we when the
[36:42] service is going on now and we're
[36:44] starting to identify where deity should
[36:46] be,
[36:47] &gt;&gt; you watch the service to get more
[36:49] quieter and quieter
[36:51] &gt;&gt; because why? Give yourself to it.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; No, but how I'm going to watch this
[36:56] movie now?
[36:58] &gt;&gt; You're going to take Jesus to the
[36:59] bicycle.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; You're going to take the Holy Ghost to
[37:05] bicycle.
[37:07] What's the word? Cinema.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Bio.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; You can't take the Holy Ghost and watch
[37:14] Netflix.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; You can't take the Holy Ghost and watch
[37:17] Showmax.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; How you going to duck and dive with the
[37:26] Holy Ghost in your deity in you and go
[37:27] see that girl you wasn't supposed to
[37:29] see?
[37:36] No,
[37:38] believe me, then deity is not in you.
[37:40] You're moving ASA out.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're moving alone.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; You're moving alone.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. Do we really want the present
[37:53] tense word?
[37:55] &gt;&gt; The present tense word is a deity must
[37:56] be found in us.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Then give yourself to it.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Give hold to it.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you're trusting the Lord
[38:07] for something,
[38:09] &gt;&gt; give yourself to the word.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; You're trusting the Lord for a wife,
[38:13] you're trusting the Lord for a husband,
[38:15] you're trusting the Lord for a job,
[38:17] you're trusting the Lord for anything in
[38:19] your life, give yourself to the word.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; I encourage you this morning, give
[38:24] yourself to the word.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Show that you're believing it. Give it
[38:29] deity. Believe it. Service it.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Be ready and die out to yourself and
[38:35] your own thoughts. But today it's
[38:37] rejected as it was then.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Are you say it's limited? This is
[38:40] unlimited.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; If if I abide in you and my word abide
[38:46] in if if your if you abide in me and my
[38:49] word abide in you, ask what you will.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:57] Jesus said, "But my father that dwelleth
[38:59] in me, he showeth me all things that
[39:02] himself doeth." Amen. There you are.
[39:04] What is it? Deity being identified in
[39:06] man.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Now, the same thing is today. That
[39:09] deity, the promised word for this day,
[39:11] the very Christ that's in you is the
[39:13] only thing that can raise you up. That's
[39:15] deity God in you.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; If the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus,
[39:20] &gt;&gt; amen, that rose Jesus from the dead
[39:22] dwells in you, it will also quicken your
[39:24] mortal body. So there will be no
[39:26] resurrection of the sleeping saints if
[39:28] they didn't the deity is not dwelling in
[39:30] there.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; What? You're a Christian when you're
[39:35] filled. But there's no other way.
[39:37] There's no creed denominations you can
[39:39] join. Praise you can say they're all in
[39:41] vain. You've got to be born of the
[39:43] spirit of God or you're lost. Except a
[39:46] man be born again, he will in no way see
[39:48] God. That's right. You must be born
[39:49] again. And to be born again, you got to
[39:52] be filled with the Holy Ghost, the
[39:53] energy of God.
[39:55] Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; You've got to open your life and throw
[39:58] yourself out and let deity God
[40:00] tabernacle himself in you.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Now,
[40:09] the Holy Ghost is deity.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying the Holy Ghost is
[40:14] deity.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; God tabernacled in man.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; It's more than a sensation.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; So people want to have it on the flesh.
[40:21] It's more than in your flesh. It's more
[40:24] than speaking in tongues, more than
[40:26] gifts.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's more than shouting in the
[40:28] spirit.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; So, it goes past the realm of the
[40:31] spirit,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; You go to some churches. Amen. Even in
[40:37] the message, a lot of Pentecost going
[40:39] on. A lot of emotions in the flesh. A
[40:41] lot of Amen. walk up and and all kinds
[40:43] of things. Even sp amen shouting in the
[40:46] spirit and all of these things. It's
[40:47] more than just weeping. It's more than
[40:49] just joining church. It's God living.
[40:52] Amen. Amen.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Deity God himself tabernacle into that
[40:56] person when he can speak and it's just
[40:59] the same as God speaking.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, did somebody read that?
[41:03] &gt;&gt; When you speak, it's the same as God
[41:05] speaking.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Not some mental work up now, but God
[41:09] dwelling in your heart that when you
[41:11] speak, God is speaking through your
[41:12] lips.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; The same God that said, "Let there be
[41:18] and there was" is the same God speaking
[41:20] through you. So when you speak to your
[41:22] situation, when you speak to your
[41:24] problem, Amen. It's God using your lips
[41:26] to speak to that situation.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; That's the church of Jesus Christ.
[41:32] That's the way that first apostolic
[41:34] church went forth.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; To receive the Holy Ghost, that's you
[41:42] tabernacling deity.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Your words is
[41:48] &gt;&gt; his words.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Glory. Praise the Lord.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Notice quietness.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Because the words we speaking is not his
[41:55] words.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; The words we speaking, Amen, is our own
[41:59] words.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; We need to be temperate.
[42:04] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; We need to let go of all colorful
[42:09] language.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; We need to let go of all vernacular.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people speaking third party
[42:21] language,
[42:27] &gt;&gt; third party language.
[42:33] You know, you're lucky I'm not the old
[42:34] man I was
[42:36] either way. I would have finished you.
[42:40] What are you trying to say?
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; So, which means that you know when
[42:45] somebody die, you can't resurrect him.
[42:51] Hey,
[42:53] &gt;&gt; you can't resurrect him.
[42:55] He must be dead. The old man must be
[42:58] dead.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; He is the word.
[43:09] So when he's spirit born, spirits fil
[43:11] man in faith takes that word into his
[43:14] heart. Amen.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; If you believe in your heart, confess
[43:18] with your mouth.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; He's going to use Romans 10 here. Now,
[43:23] &gt;&gt; if you believe in your heart, he's going
[43:24] to use Mark 11:23. You believe in your
[43:27] heart, place it upon your lips. Why?
[43:29] That is the same as deity speaking.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; You say it doesn't work. Let there be a
[43:35] squirrel there.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Squirrel appeared.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; You know why it's not happening? What
[43:42] was last week's message?
[43:44] We're not applying.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; We're not practicing. To apply means to
[43:49] practice.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; You're going through a situation. You're
[43:52] thinking it's in the flesh. You're
[43:54] thinking it's just there. God is
[43:56] presenting you with situations daily for
[43:58] you to speak over that situation.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; God wants you to practice to apply the
[44:04] word.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, this situation is not ordinary.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; This is a very unusual situation. Lord,
[44:11] &gt;&gt; I can recognize you in this, but I'm
[44:14] going to now express the God in me.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm now going to apply the word by
[44:20] faith.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; You put your seal on me to show
[44:26] that I'm your product.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; I was made in your image. Last week we
[44:31] told you about the manufacturer putting
[44:32] a warranty on his product.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know they give you 6 months to a
[44:36] year, maybe a very good product, they'll
[44:38] give you two years.
[44:40] warranty on appliances and things beds
[44:43] that might give you 10 year but only on
[44:45] the structure.
[44:47] Praise the Lord. But you know when he
[44:49] put his seal on you
[44:52] &gt;&gt; it's an eternal warranty,
[44:54] &gt;&gt; an eternal guarantee,
[44:57] &gt;&gt; you pass from dead unto life.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Meaning if you are dysfunctional, he's
[45:01] not going to reject you when he sees
[45:03] you. Your warranty is always active.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't throw the clay away. Yes.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; When we are defective, he doesn't throw
[45:12] the clay away. He takes you back into
[45:14] his workshop and he reworks you and he
[45:16] molds you and he shapes you.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; So, where's the spirit born spiritual
[45:25] man and daughter of God this morning?
[45:26] Let me see your hands.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me see your hands.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; So, he says when a spirit born fil man
[45:32] in faith takes that word into his heart,
[45:34] places it upon his lips.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Why? That is the same as D speaking.
[45:39] Every mountain has to go. Speak now.
[45:42] Every mountain has to go. Speak now. Oh,
[45:45] somebody's not getting this.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Spirit of God move. Amen. Right now, the
[45:50] word is going to activate into a living
[45:52] word. Speak now. Amen. Every mountain
[45:55] has to go. Satan cannot stand before
[45:58] that man. I say right now, stand up and
[46:00] speak the profession of your faith.
[46:02] Satan cannot speak before that man.
[46:05] Satan cannot stand before that man who
[46:08] will receive the word of the Lord.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Who art thou great mountain to stand
[46:12] before Zerub of God. I tell you the room
[46:14] of God is here right now. Dear he is
[46:17] here right now. Speak to your mountain
[46:19] right now. Take a moment and speak to
[46:21] your situation. Amen. Hallelujah.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; It shall be done as you speak even now.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. Apply the word.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Apply the word in faith.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't just be a spectator here
[46:35] this morning. Don't just come in and
[46:36] hear a good sermon this morning. Speak
[46:38] the word.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; I've always said, you don't know who you
[46:48] are.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; That man sitting by you is a son of God.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor. Look at them.
[46:55] You're looking at a son of God.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying that man, that
[46:58] sister sitting next to you is a son or
[47:00] daughter of God. Amen.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; That woman sitting by you, he's a
[47:04] daughter. We are sons and daughters of
[47:06] God sitting together in heavenly places
[47:09] right now in Christ Jesus. Him working
[47:11] with us, confirming the word with signs
[47:13] following, not we will be in the
[47:15] millennium.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Who needs healing in the millennium?
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Who needs a house in the millennium?
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Who needs a car in the millennium?
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Who needs a better job in the
[47:24] millennium? Not in the millennium.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; We don't need healing in the millennium.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; He says no. We not we will be in the
[47:32] millennium. Stop that idea.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; No. You know when I have my body
[47:38] changed. Hey, then you must watch me for
[47:40] what?
[47:41] &gt;&gt; We're all going to be the same. You're
[47:42] going to be looking ordinary.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Bible says now are we the sons of God.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Now our creation is growing. Now are we
[47:50] to manifest
[47:53] &gt;&gt; gy?
[47:54] &gt;&gt; We're going to come there. Amen. After
[47:55] the body change your brew, you need
[47:56] healing. That brew is there between 18
[47:58] and 21. He don't need healing.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; I tell you what's happening with you.
[48:04] When we needed you on the earth, you
[48:05] were a wall.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Now you coming and you're asking. You
[48:10] can't see I got my nice legs. You can't
[48:12] see my uh stomach is gone in.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; I'm in the brilliance of youth.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; I got my hair back.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about?
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying you don't need
[48:22] healing in the millennium.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Don't come there in the wedding supper
[48:26] and ask, "Brew, you sick? You want to be
[48:27] healed? What's wrong with you? Why you
[48:29] not coming now?
[48:34] &gt;&gt; You know this brother is suffering and
[48:35] struggling with things. You know that
[48:36] sister is struggling with things.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Did you ever make an appointment on a
[48:39] time to say, "Brother, we're going to
[48:41] pray right now. We're going to believe
[48:42] the word of God together."
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Who said you must leave everything for
[48:46] the ministry? Who says you must leave
[48:48] everything, Amen, for the pastor? Who
[48:50] says you can't ignite that faith within
[48:52] you to say, you know what, I'm praying
[48:53] for that brother. I'm praying for that
[48:55] sister. Amen. The prayer of faith shall
[48:57] heal the sick.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; You can see your brothers struggling.
[49:01] You can see your sister struggling.
[49:02] Amen. They renting and they not Amen.
[49:04] Don't How about you pray and say, "Lord,
[49:07] &gt;&gt; give them a home."
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Well, how about the people that are
[49:14] renting and don't have their own house?
[49:16] How about we start to believe?
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; That the Lord is more than able to
[49:20] provide.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, when I read there, all things are
[49:24] possible. Mark 9:23. All
[49:27] &gt;&gt; All things
[49:28] &gt;&gt; all things are possible to them that
[49:30] believe.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Hey, you know, I'm happy. You know the
[49:34] what I have.
[49:36] Then you be happy.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; You must be a man of vision.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; God likes a man of vision.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "I like a man of
[49:46] vision. Doors indoors.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; I like a man of vision.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody who's not just laying by. God
[49:52] was a God of vision.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; He envisioned the world.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; He envisioned animals. He envisioned
[49:57] fish. He envisioned plant life, animal
[50:00] life. He envisioned the stars, the moon.
[50:02] He He was a God of great vision.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; We made in his image and likeness.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; You saying you satisfied?
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Not we will be in the millennium. We
[50:18] need healing.
[50:19] We don't need healing in the millennium.
[50:22] Now is when we need healing. Now is when
[50:25] God is Jehovah Gyra to provide some
[50:28] things that we've got need of.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Did I read right?
[50:32] &gt;&gt; I read wrong.
[50:35] Brother Tyson, read this loud.
[50:38] I want you to read the one word that I
[50:40] read wrong. Right now is when God is
[50:43] Jehovah Gyra to provide.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; No, ask brother Tyson.
[50:50] What? Anything. You mean you can ask
[50:53] anything?
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Now is when God is Jehovah
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Gyra.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you that you gave me to
[51:06] live week to week.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Do you know what he is the high priest
[51:10] of?
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Confession.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; He's the high priest of your
[51:15] &gt;&gt; confession.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Confession.
[51:19] John Ryan confessed something
[51:22] that he wasn't experiencing.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; He was saying, "Thank you, Lord. I'm
[51:27] healed. Praise God. I'm healed."
[51:29] &gt;&gt; So, when the high priest was taking this
[51:31] John Ryan's confession, he's the high
[51:33] priest of our confession. He's looking
[51:36] at John Ryan's confession, but
[51:38] physically John is blind. So when the
[51:40] high priest got the confession,
[51:43] he's got the confession that John is
[51:44] healed, but he's looking back and he's
[51:47] saying, "Let's align John's eye to his
[51:49] confession."
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; John Ryan was repeating it for about 6
[51:57] months.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; You repeated for a day and you got
[52:01] tired.
[52:03] So as long as you say Lord I thank you
[52:05] that I'm able to live week to week. The
[52:08] high priest is taking your confession.
[52:09] He has a thankful heart. He has week to
[52:11] week.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But imagine if now you
[52:15] are living week to week. And you say
[52:17] Lord I thank you that I have a six month
[52:19] supply.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; I thank you I have a six month supply.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; I thank you I have a six month supply.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; What is the high priest going to do?
[52:29] &gt;&gt; John's confession. He's got a 6 month
[52:30] supply, but he's got a week's supply
[52:32] there. Let's make his supply match his
[52:36] confession.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you how the
[52:39] confession high priest handles your
[52:41] confession.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; If you can do it for healing, he can do
[52:45] it for anything.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; He is your gyro.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Gyra means provider.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Ask and you shall. receive
[53:03] Jehovah Gyra to provide anything that
[53:05] we've got need of for we are Abraham's
[53:07] seed under the covenant through the
[53:09] death and burial and resurrection of
[53:10] Jesus Christ.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; I know some of you don't like debt.
[53:16] So that's good. Then he still Jehovah
[53:19] Gyra to provide for your financial needs
[53:23] according to your confession.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; One of the days you're going to call me
[53:29] and tell me, "Please dedicate my house
[53:31] that I bought cash."
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Please come. They're going to see
[53:40] somebody a fancy car. You're going to
[53:42] ask to the Sam, you got a visitor today,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; but the Sam will say, "I don't know
[53:45] whose car that is."
[53:49] Then you're going to see one of your
[53:50] brothers and sisters jumping out that
[53:52] car.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; But it's not for everyone. Remember what
[53:59] I'm speaking on.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; This is the one who believes and
[54:01] confess.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Then the high priest knows how to handle
[54:04] your confession.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. You You're telling me you
[54:08] got into sin and he got you out of sin?
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[54:12] &gt;&gt; you got into sin and he got you out of
[54:14] sin.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; You got into trouble, he got you out of
[54:16] trouble. You mean he got into debt, he
[54:18] can't get you out of debt?
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Where's your faith?
[54:24] Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; How about you go and apply a scripture?
[54:31] He whom the son of man has set free is
[54:33] free indeed. So want to be debt free.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; So you can put there, he who the son of
[54:42] man has set debt free is debtree indeed.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; But it's not for everyone. If you're not
[54:51] called to be up here and receive this
[54:52] word right now, go back down.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; But if you can receive the confession
[54:57] right now,
[54:58] &gt;&gt; change your confession.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Change your confession.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Leave negativity.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Let's move on. What's the time now?
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. 11:23. Ask what you want. Watch
[55:11] when the spirit ask, what is the time
[55:13] now?
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. 11:23 is
[55:17] &gt;&gt; if you say to this mountain, be thou
[55:19] removed and cast into the sea and don't
[55:21] doubt in your heart.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, wonder.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Remember the last time I said that,
[55:28] brother Joshua asked
[55:29] &gt;&gt; and he spoke something instantly
[55:31] &gt;&gt; when they went out. They got a buy for
[55:33] those dogs. You remember the testimony?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Remember when the angel of God is here?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's move on. Amen. Just a few
[55:40] more and then we finish. The deity of
[55:41] him. Who is he? Some of them makes him a
[55:44] little baby back there. He is the one
[55:46] that stood on the invisible platform,
[55:48] raised his hands and spoke, "Let there
[55:50] be light."
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you this is you now.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; This very God is living in you.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; And there was light. That was Jesus
[56:02] Christ. For he was in the world and the
[56:04] world was made by him and the world
[56:06] recognized him not. He is the deity of
[56:08] God. Look what it You're not seeing it.
[56:12] Sorry.
[56:13] Number seven, you're not seeing it.
[56:15] Praise the Lord.
[56:19] Look what he did back there. Talk about
[56:21] the miraculous back there. You talk
[56:23] about shouting when he performed the
[56:24] miraculous things to make things which
[56:26] are now out of things which was not. He
[56:29] spoke and it was so. And that same
[56:31] power, that same Christ, hallelujah,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; let the fundamentalist, let them who
[56:36] deny the power of God say say it's
[56:38] wrong. But that same power that spoke
[56:40] the word into existence is in those
[56:42] people that's got the Holy Ghost.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; The same power that said, "Let there be
[56:48] &gt;&gt; light."
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Hey, some of you sleeping.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Some of you are daydreaming. Tap your
[56:56] neighbor. Say, "Come back to earth."
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Or tell them, "Come back to their
[57:03] headstone."
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Come back, Leo. Oh, sorry. I forgot if
[57:09] you're not called to be up here, you
[57:10] have to go back down.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; So those of you that have gone to sleep,
[57:13] stay there.
[57:15] Those that are in heavenly places right
[57:17] now, listen to what he's saying.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; The same power that spoke the world into
[57:21] existence is in those people that's got
[57:23] the Holy Ghost.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Please don't make my prophet a liar.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; It's in those people that's got the Holy
[57:29] Ghost.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; The same creative power that said, "Let
[57:32] there be
[57:34] &gt;&gt; is in those people that's got the Holy
[57:35] Ghost." That's right, men and women.
[57:37] It's time we found out who you are.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Satan has been holding your withholding
[57:42] your identity.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Anybody come to you, they
[57:46] want to see your South African uh Amen.
[57:49] ID document or a passport. Amen. Tell
[57:51] them I'm not of this world. Amen. I'm of
[57:53] a different kind. I'm not of this world.
[57:56] Amen. I can show you my citizenship is
[57:58] in heaven. I don't belong to this world.
[58:00] Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I defy this world.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; One of these days I'll defy even
[58:05] gravity. Amen. I defy. Amen. The the
[58:08] signs of this world and in my flesh I
[58:10] shall be changed. I shall be changed. I
[58:13] shall be changed.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. Men and woman, it's time
[58:20] we found out who you are.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; The devil is trying to hide you back.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; The Amen. The angel of God is trying to
[58:27] expose you this morning.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. The angel of God is
[58:31] breaking concrete this morning to expose
[58:34] you and show you who you are. Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Tell you that you're some little cow
[58:39] down thing, something. You're not.
[58:41] You're sons and daughters of God. The
[58:43] deity is not in heaven.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe. Amen. We're going to
[58:52] shout and scream right now. The deity is
[58:54] not in heaven. It's in you.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody say, I am deity.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; I am.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; I am deity. I am tabernacling the most
[59:05] high God.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Deity is not in heaven.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In fact, if you wanted
[59:11] to go to the seven dimension now and
[59:13] find deity in heaven, you won't find it
[59:15] there.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what that seven seal
[59:19] was all about. That's why all of heaven
[59:21] went silent.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you getting the revelation
[59:24] of it?
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 10 will reveal where he
[59:28] is currently. Revelation 10 brought him
[59:31] back to the earth.
[59:33] Not Jesus in the physical flesh because
[59:35] Jesus can't come back to the earth.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; The body must be retained in the heavens
[59:39] until the restitution of all things. But
[59:42] the spirit that lived in Jesus came back
[59:45] to the earth. Amen. And he's living in
[59:47] you and I.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody praise God.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can take a trip right now.
[59:53] Amen. Hallelujah.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; We can even send you to the seven
[59:57] dimension. You see, deity is not in
[1:00:00] heaven. Deity is on the earth.
[1:00:02] Hallelujah.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, I challenge you to go to
[1:00:05] heaven right now and ask them, "Where is
[1:00:07] deity?"
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; They'll say, "You mean you came from the
[1:00:09] earth?
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; You came from a church service and you
[1:00:12] didn't see deity in your brother and
[1:00:14] sister.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Deity is supposed to be tabernacle in
[1:00:17] you."
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[1:00:22] the Lord.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Deity is not in heaven. It's in you.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know you think I'm crazy
[1:00:30] like some of you are thinking right now.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you are thinking I'm
[1:00:35] crazy.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; But deity is in you.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Remember what we are doing. Taking out
[1:00:40] all unbelief.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; We saying we believe the message but we
[1:00:43] believe deity is in us.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; If you say no then unbelief is there
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; and that is something Satan can work
[1:00:49] through unbelief.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; But the message of the hour is coming to
[1:00:52] take out all unbelief. So there is
[1:00:54] nothing within you that Satan can work
[1:00:56] through.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Wonderful.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; I know you think I'm crazy, but let me
[1:01:01] tell you something, brother. When you
[1:01:03] realize that almighty God lives within
[1:01:05] you, immortal life, my life I give Zoe.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; The life of God is in the human being.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So even little Zoe as
[1:01:17] amen when time comes, she will get the
[1:01:20] literal life of Jesus Christ. So Zoe
[1:01:22] will be in Zoe. Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; And Zoe is in Romesh. And Zoe is in
[1:01:26] Tyson. And Zoe is in Sherman. And Zoe is
[1:01:29] in Chaffford. And Zoe is in Tyler.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Zoe is in you.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. He stood back there. He's the
[1:01:44] creator of all things. He made life.
[1:01:46] Frogs, beans, ducks, chicken, animals.
[1:01:48] Created everything. And nothing was
[1:01:50] made. But what was made by him? Who?
[1:01:52] Christ. the deity. He brought down
[1:01:54] plagues and everything in the days of
[1:01:56] Egypt. Who Christ? He stopped the mouth
[1:01:58] of lion. He's quenched the violence of
[1:02:00] fire.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; What is he trying to tell you?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; why are you silent?
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; He spoke all of those things.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; And right now, he wants to continue the
[1:02:13] creative power,
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; but not through the lips of Jesus
[1:02:16] Christ.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; He wants to create
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; He wants to bring Romans 8:19.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Glory
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; 23 to pass.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; But he needs a willing participant.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Come on, let's stand.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; He needs a willing participant.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Call to the headstone
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; to manifest deity in you.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; You are not called up here. Leo wasn't
[1:02:47] called up here because he couldn't
[1:02:48] manifest deity.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; But you are called church.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; To the headstone.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; To manifest deity.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; You are called up here.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; to manifest
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; I believe.

[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Who wants to say Lord
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; deity come in me?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit come in me.
