[2:44] reading amen
[2:47] hallelujah what a blessed Easter
[2:49] convention we had amen amen everybody
[2:52] paying attention
[2:54] you know the angel of the Lord is very
[2:55] distracted easily
[2:57] the prophet says there shouldn't be
[2:58] children running around
[3:00] he said there shouldn't be any
[3:01] irreverence with the music
[3:04] so we're approaching the sacred time now
[3:07] amen
[3:09] he says everything should be in order I
[3:11] was reading there
[3:13] somebody took a photograph and the
[3:15] prophet said stop that
[3:17] he says that light
[3:19] is affecting me because the angel of the
[3:21] Lord is also a light
[3:23] amen remember where we come now we
[3:27] haven't just gathered if you want a
[3:28] normal Church Gathering plenty of
[3:30] churches around
[3:31] but we know the angel of the Lord is
[3:33] here amen so we want to reference him
[3:37] and make him feel welcome in our midst
[3:39] amen hallelujah so this morning we'll
[3:42] speak amen
[3:44] 2023 we know that's the year we end
[3:46] right
[3:48] but our focus is moving to manifesting
[3:50] the revelation of the hour
[3:52] no longer preaching the word as a
[3:54] prophecy that the bride will be this
[3:56] will be this will be this hallelujah
[3:58] amen
[4:00] if we continue preaching like that
[4:01] please take me into the time where it
[4:03] will be I need a time machine and take
[4:06] me to that time
[4:08] amen
[4:10] but we want to live in the Supernatural
[4:12] in the now amen yes and we want to
[4:15] manifest the revelation of the hour now
[4:17] yes yes amen otherwise like I say many
[4:20] times let us go to the grave and let the
[4:23] generation that's going to fulfill that
[4:24] scriptures come on on the scene
[4:27] now we see everything is fixing now
[4:29] remember the angel of the Lord is fixing
[4:31] things yes
[4:32] getting us ready for the coming of the
[4:34] Lord
[4:35] now he's fixing everything and he's
[4:37] fixing your life as well
[4:41] okay amen so let's read our scripture
[4:42] then you can be seated so we'll be
[4:44] speaking on manifesting the revelation
[4:46] of the hour amen the scriptures must
[4:49] become alive in you and me we'll start
[4:51] by reading revelation 10.
[4:55] amen verse 8 so this part of the
[4:59] prophecy applies to us applies to you
[5:02] amen we can Rejoice around 10 7 because
[5:05] 10 7 brought us the revelation of the
[5:07] word
[5:08] but unless 10 8 to 11 becomes alive in
[5:11] us we will not be fulfilling our part of
[5:14] the prophecy
[5:16] so 10 8 says and the voice which I heard
[5:18] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[5:21] go and take the little book which is
[5:24] open in the end of the angel with
[5:27] standard upon the sea and upon the Earth
[5:30] so if the book is open the onlooker can
[5:33] read the book yes
[5:35] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[5:38] him give me the little book
[5:41] and he said unto me take it eat it up
[5:45] and it shall be make thy belly bitter
[5:47] and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[5:50] honey so we have sweet mouths and bitter
[5:53] bellies when we take this book
[5:56] 10 10 says and I took the little book
[5:59] out of the Angel's hand and ate it up
[6:02] and it was in my hand sweet as Annie and
[6:05] as soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[6:07] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[6:11] prophesy again
[6:12] before many peoples and Nations and
[6:15] tongues and Kings amen may the Lord a
[6:18] blessing to the reading of his word you
[6:20] may be seated did we get anything sorted
[6:22] in terms of sound to be tried
[6:25] let's play a song or something Amen in
[6:26] the background like an instrumental soul
[6:28] I can go ahead and I just need to make
[6:30] sure you have sound connected
[6:32] amen
[6:35] so we know Revelation 10
[6:39] verse 8 to 11.
[6:42] has been fulfilled since the time the
[6:44] prophet went off the scene
[6:46] Believers caught the Revelation and they
[6:48] started to prophesy again
[6:50] they started to take the message amen
[6:52] remember this is not a fresh revelation
[6:54] we are bringing
[6:55] they already did it whether they knew it
[6:58] or not they were prophesying again they
[7:00] took the message around the world
[7:02] amen amen and the message began to
[7:04] strike the seed
[7:06] because the message is a light
[7:08] amen the message began to strike the sea
[7:11] predestinated seed that was laying where
[7:14] you were maybe in your denomination
[7:15] maybe in your temple maybe amen wherever
[7:18] you were
[7:19] but when the light struck the seed in
[7:21] you you start to germinate your life
[7:24] amen so 2023
[7:27] we know this is not the year to play
[7:29] Church
[7:32] it's the 117th year of the church age
[7:37] amen
[7:39] and even if you knew Jesus was coming in
[7:41] the 117th year what are you doing to
[7:44] make preparation
[7:46] it can't be business as usual right yeah
[7:49] so the year is not to play Church you
[7:51] become continue as normal it's time to
[7:54] change
[7:55] amen it's a new season and if you cannot
[7:58] cope with the power of the new season
[7:59] you die out in the whole season
[8:03] a seed has got to recognize the season
[8:05] it is in you know there are certain
[8:07] seeds on the earth that you can only
[8:08] plant in certain season otherwise you
[8:11] don't ever come to life
[8:13] amen if you buy these little seeds
[8:15] you'll see in the back of it they tell
[8:16] you which season to plant that seeding
[8:18] right amen
[8:21] so if you think about just take this
[8:23] type now there was the time the season
[8:25] of the law and the season of Grace
[8:27] those under the old system of the Lord
[8:29] died spiritually because they did not
[8:32] catch the season that was they were in
[8:34] and they had to step into the new season
[8:36] which was the New Testament they were
[8:39] stepping out from law into Grace
[8:41] so as climate and nature changes with
[8:43] each season you have to awaken to the
[8:46] changing season in the body of Christ
[8:49] amen God has already started a new thing
[8:51] there's too much evidence in the last
[8:54] three months for us to be making this up
[8:56] and for us for it to be a figment of our
[8:58] imagination and whilst many have
[9:01] awakened to what the Lord is doing in
[9:03] our life stamp some still need to catch
[9:05] it
[9:07] and I agree you catching this morning
[9:09] amen we don't want to live not be I
[9:13] yeah amen I think it's working
[9:15] amen so this is the year what is the
[9:18] year 23 23 in the Bible also has to deal
[9:22] with death
[9:23] a lot of scriptures deal with death but
[9:25] 23 spiritually die to self isn't that
[9:29] what we've been doing this year dying to
[9:31] self amen amen amen this is not about me
[9:34] this is not about some Minister amen
[9:37] this is about equipping the body of
[9:39] Christ fast collectively coming together
[9:42] empowering the body
[9:45] amen
[9:46] you shall see a performance
[9:49] of the opening of the word
[9:51] amen
[9:53] Hallelujah do you know where I'm getting
[9:55] that from
[9:56] when Mary said be it unto me according
[9:59] to Thy word the angel said You shall see
[10:01] your performance amen amen amen amen
[10:03] when you're receiving the word now you
[10:06] shall see a performance
[10:08] manifested in your life amen so this is
[10:12] the year to die to self amen hallelujah
[10:15] allow the Holy Spirit to fill you
[10:17] remember if you're too much of ourselves
[10:19] the Holy Spirit can't fill us we need to
[10:22] empty out so he can fill us not just
[10:24] fill us now we want to overflow yeah
[10:27] amen so that we can affect others others
[10:30] can drink amen so we want to live in
[10:32] that overflow Amen Let the Holy Spirit
[10:35] anoint you and govern your life amen say
[10:38] death to the carnal nature and awaken
[10:41] the spirit man Quicken the spirit man
[10:43] anoint the spirit man with the Holy
[10:45] Spirit
[10:48] amen you know why people don't want to
[10:51] submit to the Holy Spirit
[10:53] they're enjoying life too much
[10:56] amen
[10:58] because when the Holy Spirit possesses
[11:00] you he governs your life
[11:02] my son don't want to give to that
[11:04] surrender some saying no I don't want to
[11:06] be spiritual I don't want to be holy I
[11:08] just want to you know come to church and
[11:10] I just want to sit there quietly and
[11:11] nobody must trouble me
[11:15] that's not what you're called to
[11:16] manifest
[11:18] amen your call for much more than that
[11:21] so what you're going to find now you're
[11:23] going to find this the flesh is going to
[11:25] resist
[11:27] the flesh is going to resist when you
[11:29] forsake the things of the world and all
[11:31] your fleshly desires your body your
[11:34] flesh is going to have withdrawal
[11:35] symptoms
[11:38] you know what happens to an addict
[11:40] when they're trying to recover
[11:42] they start to have withdrawal symptoms
[11:45] amen
[11:48] but don't give in to the desires of the
[11:50] flesh don't give in to the pressures of
[11:52] the flesh
[11:54] amen
[11:55] don't have a relapse
[11:59] press through and diet yourself I mean
[12:02] if you're with me amen say Lord I'm
[12:03] willing to die amen if he takes
[12:05] everything let it die amen let this be
[12:08] the year that King Jesus ruled and
[12:10] Reigns over your life
[12:12] amen don't only want him to be your
[12:15] savior but let him be king
[12:17] let him be Lord over your life
[12:20] Hallelujah
[12:23] amen
[12:25] now very quickly I'm going to tell you
[12:26] this that Malachi for prophet
[12:29] came to turn our hearts back to the
[12:31] faith of the fathers
[12:33] so we have a message
[12:36] that would have given us the correct
[12:38] interpretation of scripture right
[12:40] amen and reveal the Hidden Mysteries
[12:42] like the sealed trumpets Wilds future
[12:45] home this is what we call the opening of
[12:47] the word yes
[12:49] amen so this is the opening of the word
[12:51] is what was called the third pool of
[12:53] brother branham's Ministry
[12:55] amen and all of that was given to
[12:57] produce a final result
[13:00] we got to look for the result of it the
[13:03] result is that a people there'll be a
[13:05] people and there is a people I'm talking
[13:07] to whose hearts are turned back
[13:10] to the original faith and would also
[13:13] operate in the power and the anointing
[13:15] of the original Pentecostal fathers
[13:18] not just have a revelation of the word
[13:20] but the word produces faith faith cometh
[13:23] by the hearing of the word and under the
[13:25] third pool opening of the word produces
[13:27] perfect fate
[13:29] thank you
[13:31] amen so same sign same wonders same
[13:34] manifestation making Jesus Christ
[13:36] Hebrews 13 8. amen so if the open word
[13:39] is not turning our hearts back to the
[13:42] faith and producing the same results we
[13:44] see in the book of Acts then there's a
[13:46] big question mark over your head
[13:50] the opening of the word is not
[13:52] materialized in you
[13:54] amen it does not become real in you so
[13:58] what do we have professors
[14:01] you know what professors is we are
[14:03] professing we have the opening of the
[14:04] world
[14:05] we become professors
[14:08] but we are not producing
[14:10] amen so there is a problem there your
[14:13] engine is not starting you need Dynamics
[14:15] to give you some life in your engine
[14:20] amen hallelujah so we want the Holy
[14:24] Spirit to be in our midst right
[14:29] the angel of the Lord the holy spirit
[14:31] amen let's go to a slide in amen first
[14:34] slide so we read Matthew 18 and 20. he
[14:38] okay
[14:39] and we see here the Bible says where two
[14:42] or three are gathered together in my
[14:44] name
[14:45] what's his name
[14:48] amen the revelation of his name is the
[14:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[14:52] amen
[14:54] he says there I am in the midst of them
[14:56] yes
[14:58] now if you can't see it there there's
[15:01] something blatant in there if you go to
[15:03] the next slide maybe we'll highlight it
[15:04] a bit for you where two or three are
[15:08] gathered together in my name
[15:11] imagine amen amen
[15:17] okay
[15:19] you'll catch it now
[15:20] some some CPUs are slow
[15:23] you know we work with Windows 7 and then
[15:25] we got Windows 10 and now we got Windows
[15:27] 11. amen then we also got the operating
[15:30] systems amen so some have
[15:34] core I3 some have Core i5 and some have
[15:37] called i7
[15:39] so we're letting all the CPUs catch up
[15:41] amen
[15:44] so he says where two or three are
[15:46] gathered together in my name
[15:48] there I'm in the midst of them in 23 are
[15:52] we gathered in his name
[15:53] yeah
[15:54] then he's shooting our midst no doubt
[15:57] amen hallelujah amen hallelujah let him
[16:01] be king of your life this morning now we
[16:03] go to the next line and we see you on
[16:05] mantra's figuration what do we see amen
[16:09] we see Moses in Elijah
[16:11] and we see Peter James and John go to
[16:14] the next slide amen what do we see here
[16:16] two from heaven and three from the Earth
[16:22] yeah
[16:23] come on gpus work work work amen
[16:27] Moses and Elijah and who's in the midst
[16:29] of them
[16:30] where two or three are gathered he is in
[16:34] the midst you can't make the scriptures
[16:36] live
[16:38] [Applause]
[16:40] I'm not making this up
[16:42] I'm not picking this up amen it's there
[16:44] in the world
[16:46] there's two from heaven and there's
[16:48] three from the Earth
[16:50] so two or three are gathered together in
[16:52] his name and he is there in the midst
[16:55] amen hallelujah
[16:57] so in 2023 you can go amen further now
[17:01] this is the year that the Lord is
[17:02] appearing in the midst of you
[17:05] you gotta believe it
[17:07] amen awakened to it sometimes you gotta
[17:09] pinch yourself because you say Lord is
[17:11] this really happening am I imagining
[17:13] these things you know the prophet in
[17:16] some of your Supernatural experiences
[17:18] they had to pinch himself
[17:19] you have to bite his hand because it was
[17:22] so Supernatural he wondered if you were
[17:24] seeing a vision
[17:25] but 2023 this is the year the Lord is
[17:28] appearing in the midst of you amen amen
[17:31] amen hallelujah now we just read
[17:35] Revelation 10 right but in order to
[17:37] understand Revelation 10
[17:40] progress problem
[17:41] Revelation 10
[17:43] goes together with the Revelation 11 13.
[17:47] Revelation 10 and Revelation 13 goes
[17:51] together some of you CPUs are very fast
[17:53] there amen
[17:55] events taking place in Revelation 10
[17:57] keeps the bride from being deceived by
[18:00] the events in Revelation 13. are you
[18:02] with me
[18:04] amen amen you got to know those two
[18:06] scriptures now you got to know what's
[18:08] happening in Revelation 10 you got to
[18:10] know what's happening in Revelation 13
[18:11] very quickly for those of you don't know
[18:13] Revelation 13 there's two beasts and
[18:16] there's the image unto the Beast being
[18:17] raised up and it's deceiving the old
[18:20] world
[18:20] to worship the image of the Beast right
[18:23] and who is the ones that worship Him all
[18:26] the ones that do not have the names in
[18:28] the little book we just spoke about in
[18:29] Revelation 10. so that's what Revelation
[18:31] 13 is about Revelation 10 is now
[18:35] the mighty angel coming down with a book
[18:37] from heaven and it's the title deed to
[18:39] man's inheritance amen amen so what is
[18:43] it
[18:45] Revelation 10 we can say
[18:48] is the intelligence report
[18:51] in this battle
[18:54] so in any War the intelligence report is
[18:57] very important to fight the war and to
[18:59] defeat the enemy yes you know it was a
[19:01] fault based on the intelligence they
[19:03] received
[19:04] so the bride is receiving her
[19:06] intelligence report from heaven
[19:09] amen thank you Lord amen
[19:13] so we go to the next slide we see this
[19:16] is where we're going to focus now
[19:17] Revelation 13 and 8 it says all that
[19:20] dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him
[19:24] who is that Satan become incarnate
[19:27] and he's worshiped as the God of this
[19:29] Earth
[19:31] now who's worshiping him whose names are
[19:34] not written in the Book of Life
[19:36] of the lamb slain from the foundation of
[19:39] the world
[19:41] amen
[19:43] that's where we get the scripture now
[19:44] the Lamb of slain from before the
[19:46] foundation of the world right
[19:49] so if you caught it
[19:50] the book that is coming down as names
[19:57] and you have to see your name in the
[19:59] book
[20:00] so that you won't worship the Beast
[20:04] amen amen so the intelligence report the
[20:07] bride is receiving is the Lamb's Book of
[20:10] Life and she is seeing her name in the
[20:13] book
[20:15] that's not just a statement now
[20:18] amen I don't know if you're following me
[20:20] yes yes amen
[20:22] this is the seven seal book
[20:27] the seals
[20:28] amen
[20:30] the opening of the seals
[20:33] revealed more than just the symbols
[20:36] more than just the Riders
[20:38] amen that's the hidden part you have to
[20:40] catch
[20:44] the intelligence report the bride is
[20:46] receiving the Lamb's Book of Life and
[20:48] she's seeing a name in the book
[20:51] you see when people are not quick and
[20:53] they haven't seen the name in the book
[20:55] amen hallelujah so that's what's keeping
[20:59] you from being deceived seeing your name
[21:01] in the Lamb's Book of Life that your
[21:03] name is in the family album amen
[21:05] hallelujah so that's the purpose and the
[21:09] power of the seals because beneath its
[21:11] seal our names and you must see your
[21:13] name beneath the seals the seals are not
[21:15] just revealing symbols and telling you
[21:17] about horse riders
[21:20] how many of you have faith when you know
[21:22] a the White House writer is doing this
[21:23] and the red horse rider is doing that
[21:25] that's only uncovering the devil's
[21:27] schemes uncovering his battle plan
[21:30] but you have got to see yourself as part
[21:33] of redemption's plan
[21:36] amen
[21:39] the revealing of your name took away
[21:41] your amnesia
[21:43] and when you see your name in the book
[21:45] it revealed that you have a theory from
[21:47] your body waiting and this is what is
[21:49] producing rapturing faith in you amen
[21:53] amen
[21:55] ask yourself in the message of Yahweh
[21:57] everything you know about it what is
[21:58] giving you rapturing faith
[22:00] if there's nothing there giving you
[22:02] rapturing Faith then the seals have not
[22:04] opened the Sanders have not opened to
[22:06] you because he says it will take that
[22:07] seven times to awaken her again
[22:10] what is awakened
[22:13] amen now just to go to a quote to show
[22:16] you I'm not making this up that you need
[22:17] to see your name you're in the second
[22:19] seal the property is saying in the
[22:21] closing prayer he says I'm one of those
[22:23] that's going to find my name tonight
[22:25] behind that seal Yonder
[22:30] you see what he's waiting for the people
[22:31] to catch
[22:36] he says I'm one of those that's going to
[22:38] find my name tonight behind that seal
[22:40] Yonder that was put on there from the
[22:43] foundation of the world
[22:44] something struck my heart and I'm
[22:46] standing Lord is it me are you calling
[22:49] me
[22:50] can't you hear
[22:52] your theophany calling you amen he says
[22:56] he goes on to say I want you to reveal
[22:59] to me my name over there
[23:01] fill me and seal me to yourself by the
[23:04] Holy Ghost
[23:07] hallelujah amen so what does the message
[23:11] come to do it comes to connect you to
[23:13] your theophany yes it comes to identify
[23:16] that you have a fear of in your body
[23:18] amen amen
[23:20] hear what he says now then after you
[23:22] recognize the very word of God was Eagle
[23:25] food
[23:26] notice the succession what he's talking
[23:28] about after you recognize that the word
[23:30] of God the message of the hour is Eagle
[23:32] food then you left the other thing
[23:36] then being formed into the living image
[23:39] of the Living God
[23:40] you heard from your theophany
[23:44] amen
[23:45] so the message comes to make you hear
[23:47] from your theophany
[23:50] amen tells you that you have
[23:52] representation that you have another
[23:54] body waiting for you so don't fear death
[23:58] amen
[24:00] that is not what they can do to the body
[24:02] we have another body waiting
[24:06] you know First Corinthians 15 says that
[24:08] we have one already waiting so yeah and
[24:10] the next one he says the bride hasn't
[24:12] had a Revival yet there's been no
[24:14] Revival there now pay attention to this
[24:17] no manifestation of God the bride
[24:21] no manifestation of God what produces
[24:24] the manifestation
[24:27] it says to stir the bride yet see we're
[24:31] looking for it now it'll take those
[24:32] seven unknown Thunders back there to
[24:34] wake her up again
[24:37] or somebody say Wake Me Up Lord
[24:40] amen say sorry somebody say Wake Me Up
[24:43] Lord say Lord manifest yourself
[24:46] because that's the two important
[24:47] elements in the scripture in this quote
[24:50] we need a manifestation of God
[24:53] and we need to be awake
[24:57] so just to Define that quote what is the
[25:00] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[25:02] the Dynamics
[25:05] the Holy Ghost
[25:07] amen the Dynamics will produce the
[25:10] manifestation
[25:11] amen it'll take those seven unknown
[25:13] pandas to wake up again what is that to
[25:16] waking up again means to take away your
[25:18] nesia
[25:19] like the eagle that was in the chicken
[25:21] ten was awakened
[25:24] took away the Amnesia yes
[25:26] you say no it can't be that simple
[25:29] God in simplicity
[25:31] I'm waiting for some mysterious
[25:33] Revelation on the seventh unders God in
[25:35] simplicity
[25:37] awaken you
[25:39] you are a part of God
[25:41] yes I still see I'm not catching it and
[25:44] not only are they not catching it
[25:46] they're not
[25:47] excited about it that's a problem
[25:50] that's a problem right there if you're
[25:53] not excited that your name is found in
[25:55] the book that you have salvation that
[25:57] you have representation from before the
[25:59] foundation of the world that it's
[26:01] nothing you have done but God has
[26:02] already predestinated your life
[26:05] amen you just have to awaken in the hour
[26:07] and manifest your part of the scripture
[26:11] awaken means to take away your amnesia
[26:14] you once walked in light
[26:17] you won't tell the truth
[26:19] but then you came into this world
[26:23] and it's hidden seed and you got blinded
[26:25] you got amnesia
[26:27] but now the Lord has sent forth the
[26:30] opening of the world to take away your
[26:31] nation amen amen so that's why the
[26:35] prophet keeps using that type of the
[26:37] eagle and the chicken
[26:40] when the Eagle's Amnesia got taken away
[26:42] he had to leave the chicken pen he had
[26:46] to sow into the heavenlies
[26:48] amen oh Hallelujah I know some of you
[26:52] want me to tickle your ears with some
[26:53] mighty Revelation on the seventh
[26:55] hundreds
[26:57] you know what they told the prophet oh
[26:59] it'll be some great Revelation Lord
[27:01] prophet he says no it'll be something
[27:04] you can't be something out of the word
[27:06] it'll already be something in the world
[27:09] he says because Revelation says you
[27:12] can't add to the book and you can't take
[27:13] away amen amen hallelujah you remember
[27:16] the time he preaches message and his one
[27:19] brother was so enthused he said that
[27:20] could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation
[27:27] amen
[27:29] Hallelujah
[27:32] now let's go back to this Revelation 10
[27:36] and revelation 13.
[27:38] see if you can pick up your CPUs work
[27:41] there's two beasts in Revelation Tim
[27:44] deceiving the inhabitants of the earth
[27:46] and causing them to worship the image of
[27:49] the Beast but in Revelation amen so
[27:51] that's sorry two peace in Revelation 10
[27:54] right deceiving but in I should have
[27:56] said it the other way Ashley typo error
[27:59] two beats in Revelation 13 you can fix
[28:02] it there if you want two peace in
[28:04] Revelation 13 deceiving the inhabitants
[28:06] of the Earth
[28:07] causing them to worship the image of the
[28:10] Beast but in Revelation 10 there are
[28:13] three opposing forces
[28:15] can you see the two and the three there
[28:17] again
[28:19] oh Hallelujah
[28:22] two in Revelation 13 3 in Revelation 10
[28:26] who's the three the mighty angel from
[28:28] heaven the seventh angel William Branham
[28:31] and Sean the bride you
[28:33] amen amen
[28:37] Hallelujah
[28:40] amen oh bless the name of Jesus amen
[28:42] amen
[28:44] he's worthy to be praised now just to
[28:46] reiterate I'm going to say this again
[28:48] your Nisha is taken away when you see
[28:51] your name in the family album the little
[28:53] pook which is the Lamb's Book of Life so
[28:55] where did you see it beneath the seal
[28:59] beneath the seal you'll find your name
[29:01] you've got to ask yourself which seal
[29:04] you'll find your name
[29:07] amen
[29:08] Hallelujah
[29:11] so for those of you CPUs were really
[29:13] slow let's define this maybe we'll do
[29:16] some math so Revelation 10 plus
[29:19] Revelation 11
[29:21] mathematically gives you what
[29:26] are we making this up
[29:28] why is it there
[29:31] why are these two conflicting forces
[29:33] that come down for the final battle on
[29:35] the Earth
[29:36] going with this number
[29:40] amen
[29:42] 10 plus 13 Revelation 10 plus Revelation
[29:45] 13 equals
[29:48] amen so what is it happening the battle
[29:51] is on for you
[29:53] you say for me yes Heaven wants you and
[29:56] hell wants you
[29:59] both are fighting for you
[30:01] ask yourself to whom will you surrender
[30:04] amen amen ask yourself to whom will you
[30:08] surrender
[30:09] amen
[30:11] now if it if the if it's focused on you
[30:14] then you're a three-part being right
[30:18] everybody agree
[30:21] you're a three-part being now filled
[30:23] with the Holy Spirit making you a
[30:25] supernatural being
[30:28] so you got Body Soul spirit and now you
[30:32] have the Holy Spirit
[30:34] okay but
[30:37] your body was formed in the womb of your
[30:39] mother
[30:41] anybody was formed outside the home
[30:47] I need you to say Amen so you understand
[30:49] what I'm saying
[30:50] your body was formed in the womb of your
[30:52] mother it took cells from your mother
[30:54] and it took cells from your father
[30:55] coming together in order to form the
[30:58] body
[31:01] who did biology in school let me see
[31:03] your hands quickly I don't know what
[31:05] they call it these days
[31:10] now this is going to blow your mind in
[31:12] the humans each cell contains 23 pairs
[31:15] of chromosomes
[31:26] it takes 23 chromosomes from the father
[31:31] 23 from the mother
[31:34] together forming a total of 46
[31:39] Hallelujah
[31:42] oh Hallelujah somebody praise God please
[31:46] amen hallelujah amen he's worth it we
[31:50] praise
[31:51] amen amen I know you're catching it I'm
[31:54] just letting you digest it you know
[31:56] sometimes when you chew a steak you
[31:57] gotta chew quickly
[31:59] amen and when it's really good because
[32:02] what is Psalm 46 God is our refuge and
[32:05] our strength
[32:07] we're not making this up now it's there
[32:09] mathematically because God is a God is
[32:11] the one who created maths
[32:15] 23 23.
[32:18] amen
[32:21] what does it say in Psalm 46
[32:25] I just thought of this now so I'm
[32:27] finding it
[32:30] yeah 46 and verse 5. so Psalm 46 is 23
[32:34] and 23 Psalm 46 that's what made me
[32:36] think of Psalm 46 right now but we also
[32:40] said that in the midst of two or three
[32:42] uh in presence of two or three Gathering
[32:45] his name is in the midst what is Psalm
[32:47] 46 verse 5 watch how the spirit will
[32:49] connect us now you're watching the
[32:50] operation of the spirit right now God is
[32:53] in the midst of her in psalm 46.
[32:57] hallelujah amen God is in the midst of
[33:00] her she shall not be moved amen God
[33:03] shall help her and write early
[33:05] amen hallelujah so there's 23
[33:08] chromosomes amen and the 23rd pair of
[33:11] chromosomes are known as the six
[33:13] chromosomes because they decide if
[33:15] you'll be both be male and female not
[33:17] both now if you will be born male or
[33:20] female
[33:21] what determines it the 23rd pair
[33:26] is this coincidence
[33:31] no
[33:33] it's not coincidence
[33:35] amen you know that there's X and Y
[33:38] chromosomes
[33:39] right right
[33:40] but the 23rd pair determines whether you
[33:43] are male or female and what is the
[33:45] struggle on the earth now
[33:47] gender neutral right they don't want the
[33:50] 23rd chromosome that came first right
[33:53] now amen they don't want the 25th
[33:55] chromosome it's an agenda they are
[33:58] driving on the earth gender neutral
[34:00] don't tell the child whether it's male
[34:02] or female when they grow up let them
[34:04] decide yeah
[34:06] yeah
[34:08] they don't want the 23rd elements
[34:14] amen hallelujah because they know amen
[34:17] hallelujah
[34:18] so then after I told you a three-part
[34:20] being but the after your body if they
[34:22] can if they can corrupt the body
[34:24] make you lose your identity
[34:27] amen what will it do your spirit can
[34:30] never be quickened your soul will be
[34:32] bound
[34:33] if they corrupt the body the 23 or 23
[34:36] chromosomes your soul is bound
[34:40] but if God has come to set you free
[34:42] healing the son of man is set free is
[34:45] free indeed this morning
[34:48] amen it's come to liberate you come to
[34:51] give you your identity
[34:53] amen hallelujah amen
[34:57] oh is worthy to be praised amen
[35:01] here the prophet says now
[35:03] he says the reason I do believe that
[35:05] when the bride is called out and elected
[35:07] and set in The Book of Life are we
[35:09] talking about the Book of Life are we
[35:11] talking about seeing your name in the
[35:12] book how you saw your name the seals
[35:14] were opened
[35:16] he says what will come now this is where
[35:18] we type into a manifestation now he says
[35:21] there come a sound from Heaven that will
[35:23] take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit
[35:25] into that bride
[35:29] that will take up from the earth in a
[35:31] rupture increase I believe the season
[35:34] has opened up now
[35:36] amen what she doesn't say the holy
[35:38] spirit will come he says he'll take such
[35:41] a baptism
[35:43] it'll take such a baptism amen of the
[35:46] Holy Spirit into that bride that will
[35:49] take her from the earth in a rapturing
[35:51] Grace
[35:54] and no this is the quote we're driving
[35:56] all the time this year the Dynamics this
[35:58] is found in what shall I do with Jesus
[36:00] called Christ paragraph 116 he says the
[36:03] Dynamics of this church will be a
[36:06] refilling of the Holy Spirit
[36:10] refill Me Lord
[36:12] that's what we ought to be saying right
[36:13] there refill me Lord that's the Dynamics
[36:16] of the church refill Me Lord
[36:19] amen that we have words now watch what
[36:22] he's saying time is ministering up he's
[36:24] saying
[36:25] now was it a small thing what was
[36:27] happening in in the prophet's Ministry
[36:28] no right we wouldn't call it a small
[36:30] measure but what did he say he's saying
[36:33] that we have worked in a small measure
[36:35] while The Headstone is coming down to
[36:37] unite with the body
[36:39] so if it was so great while it was
[36:42] coming down to your night what will it
[36:44] be when it's United It's uniting Time
[36:47] and Time
[36:48] amen quick into a church amen
[36:52] amen he doesn't stop Jesus but when the
[36:55] head and body unites together the full
[36:58] power of the Holy Ghost would raise her
[37:01] up
[37:02] amen hallelujah
[37:05] it says when the full power of the Holy
[37:07] Ghost amen say Lord give me the full
[37:09] power amen
[37:11] now watch what he does a truthful thing
[37:13] it raises her up
[37:16] that's the shout and even the death
[37:20] amen
[37:21] America
[37:23] the Holy Ghost in you why
[37:26] there's nothing else no more scriptures
[37:28] to be fulfilled
[37:30] amen it's got to make a quickening power
[37:33] in you that these ugly actions cannot
[37:36] contain your body you've got to change
[37:38] Dimensions amen
[37:40] quickening power is in you that it will
[37:42] also amen cause the manifestation and
[37:45] cause the next part of the prophecy to
[37:47] come to pass which is amen the
[37:49] resurrection of the sleeping Saints
[37:52] he says the full power of the Holy Ghost
[37:54] amen would raise up just exactly like
[37:57] that even the dead that's dead in Christ
[37:59] for hundreds of years ago will rise in
[38:02] the beauty of his Holiness and take a
[38:04] flight to the skies both you living and
[38:07] both the dead Resurrection take your
[38:09] flight to the skies and here you
[38:10] reiterate the Dynamics is the Holy
[38:13] Spirit
[38:20] amen hallelujah now you say oh brother
[38:24] I missed the first season
[38:27] I missed the first three months
[38:29] 2023
[38:31] January to March
[38:34] we're going to reset the clock for you
[38:38] you said you have the power
[38:41] amen
[38:43] do you have the power well Joshua spoke
[38:45] to the son
[38:47] all things are possible to them that
[38:50] believe amen
[38:53] I was telling you so a few weeks ago
[38:54] that we are in the 11th Hour
[38:57] remember
[38:58] we are the 11th Hour Gentile workers
[39:02] and on the plug
[39:04] isn't that the 23rd hour
[39:09] on the clock there's 24 hours in the day
[39:12] but 11 pm it's the 23rd hour
[39:19] so in the 23rd hour
[39:21] he's pouring out the Dynamics
[39:23] he's pouring out the fullness of the
[39:25] Holy Ghost In You
[39:27] amen
[39:29] so
[39:31] you got to go to this next one now
[39:33] so according to the Jew to the Hebrew
[39:35] calendar
[39:37] their first month of the year is Nissan
[39:41] and it doesn't start in January so there
[39:44] are two calendars right that people when
[39:46] in fact China's got their own calendar
[39:47] and different
[39:49] people of the earth got their own
[39:51] calendar you know about the Chinese New
[39:53] Year the Jews have their own New Year
[39:56] and we have our new year
[39:58] because we are following the solo
[40:01] calendar
[40:01] but the Jews Hebrews followed the lunar
[40:05] calendar
[40:06] you'll find even the Muslims who's a
[40:08] impersonation of the Jews follow the
[40:11] lunar calendar
[40:12] right
[40:14] so Nissan is the first month
[40:18] and it coincides with March in April
[40:21] in our calendar
[40:25] now in there in Israel it's spring
[40:30] you know Lambs are gone in springtime
[40:35] amen I'm going somewhere with this but
[40:37] catch it
[40:39] so the Hebrew New Year starts in the
[40:41] month of Nissan which is called a bit
[40:44] and this year the Hebrew New Year is
[40:46] five seven eight three
[40:49] amen
[40:53] amen
[40:54] but they are following this not because
[40:56] they decided that they want to follow
[40:58] this calendar God told them when the new
[41:01] year will be
[41:03] amen amen
[41:06] so they followed in lunar calendar and
[41:08] it's determined by the moon but God is
[41:10] the one who told him when it would be
[41:12] the first man and you'll find that in
[41:13] Exodus 12 verse 2.
[41:18] Exodus 12 verse 2 let's go to the slide
[41:20] it says
[41:21] and the Lord's begun to Moses and Aaron
[41:24] in the land of Egypt saying this month
[41:27] shall be unto you the beginning of
[41:28] months amen amen
[41:32] and it shall be the first month of the
[41:34] year to you
[41:36] so God determined when the first month
[41:39] of the year would be
[41:44] amen
[41:46] watch now Exodus 12 is very prophetic
[41:48] because it's speaking about the Passover
[41:50] Lamb
[41:54] so what are we establishing
[41:56] that the New Years just started
[41:57] according to the Hebrew calendar right
[42:02] what did it say there
[42:04] you can go and read it that is between
[42:06] March and April the first month
[42:09] right
[42:13] so verse 3 says speak the answer to the
[42:15] congregation of Israel saying in the
[42:17] 10th day of this month they shall take
[42:19] every manly lamb so there's the lamb
[42:23] according to the house of the father is
[42:25] a lamp for an house right
[42:27] now your lamb shall be without blemish
[42:31] a male of the first year and you shall
[42:34] take it out from your sheep or from your
[42:36] goats and you shall keep it up until the
[42:38] 14th day of the same month okay
[42:46] and the whole assembly of the
[42:48] congregation of Israel shall kill it in
[42:51] the evening
[42:54] so when was the lamb slain on the 14th
[42:56] the first time it was slain in Egypt on
[42:59] the 14th day of Nisan
[43:03] amen
[43:05] now in the first Exodus on the 14th day
[43:08] of Lisa and they killed the lamb applied
[43:09] the blood the dead Angel passed through
[43:12] the land and they left Egypt everybody
[43:14] agreed
[43:16] Amen in the second Exodus on the 14th
[43:19] day of Nissan they killed the Lamb of
[43:20] God Amen amen and all who apply the
[43:23] blood can leave the law and enter into
[43:25] Grace
[43:28] the first Exodus was the type
[43:31] of the second Exodus
[43:34] now we in the third
[43:38] so in the Third Exodus after seven
[43:40] Church ages the true word is rejected
[43:43] the word is crucified
[43:46] but the token life which is the blood
[43:48] type of the blood the Holy Ghost comes
[43:50] upon the believer and we are preparing
[43:53] to leave the Earth to go to heaven
[43:58] amen so it these are some of the things
[44:01] that happen now quickly I'm going to
[44:02] tell you it was in the month of Nisa and
[44:04] that God spoke to Moses in the burning
[44:06] bush
[44:07] it was in the month of Nissan that
[44:09] Joshua enters the Promised Land
[44:11] then take over Jericho and sit a
[44:14] predestinated sea called Raya free
[44:20] nehemiah's commissioned in the month of
[44:22] Nishan to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem
[44:26] Nehemiah 2 verse 1 it came to pass in
[44:28] the month of Nisan in the 20th year of
[44:31] artist Xerxes the king that wine was
[44:34] before him
[44:36] and I took up the wine and gave it unto
[44:38] the king sometimes people need to be
[44:40] stimulated with Revelation that's why
[44:42] Nehemiah is giving the king some
[44:44] stimulation of Revelation but watch the
[44:47] timing and the season he's doing it in
[44:49] the new year
[44:54] way is there
[44:56] in that Kingdom it's not the new year
[44:59] but according to God's calendar it's the
[45:02] new year amen and something triggers in
[45:06] the month of Nisan to go and take some
[45:09] stimulation of Revelation
[45:12] and give it to the king
[45:15] now I have not been Before Time sad in
[45:18] his presence amen now
[45:21] we don't want to go into that right now
[45:22] but I want to go to a quote where the
[45:24] Prophet is saying you'll find this in
[45:26] the 70th week of Daniel paragraph 64. he
[45:29] says now the going forth of the
[45:31] Commandment to rebuild Jerusalem which
[45:33] was on the 14th day of March
[45:37] if any one of you want to put that down
[45:39] in the Hebrew you'll find it called
[45:40] Nissan
[45:41] Nissan means much the issue was given on
[45:44] the 14th day of March 4 45 the issue
[45:47] went for to build rebuild the Temple you
[45:50] understand it as people have read the
[45:52] scriptures everybody understand
[45:55] it was also in the month of Nissan that
[45:58] essays to come into a full position
[46:01] and Eamonn is killed and the Jews are
[46:04] saved from a Mass Slaughter
[46:09] amen
[46:11] Jesus was born in the month of Nisa
[46:13] Jesus was killed in the month of Nisa
[46:15] and Jesus rose again in the month of
[46:17] Nisan
[46:22] man
[46:24] do you know the Jews believe that their
[46:26] Deliverance will come in the month of
[46:27] Nissan
[46:30] now you're saying oh brother why are you
[46:33] labeling the point amen why are you
[46:36] laboring the point
[46:38] you're getting excited about that
[46:43] you know the prophet says one time there
[46:44] was a man
[46:45] was he excited about the word of God
[46:48] and he the daughter was having a tea
[46:50] party
[46:51] yeah and she says Dad I'm having my
[46:53] friend come over
[46:54] but I don't want you to make noise I'm
[46:56] going to put you up in the antique
[46:59] and I'm going to keep this geography
[47:01] book
[47:02] and you read that book there and we're
[47:05] just going to have a tea part here and
[47:07] when we finish we'll call you down so
[47:08] they're busy with the Tea Party the
[47:10] father is reading the geography book
[47:13] and all of a sudden they hear a shot of
[47:14] Hallelujah praise the Lord and there's
[47:16] jumping up and down you know some
[47:18] Pentecostal people
[47:20] two Pentecostals
[47:22] can't keep the fire down
[47:25] or she goes up there and said dad did
[47:27] not tell you to be quiet I gave you a
[47:28] joke if you put what are you so excited
[47:30] about
[47:31] you're not even reading the Bible he
[47:33] says oh I'm reading near her in the in
[47:35] this uh in this geography book and
[47:37] they're telling me there's a place that
[47:39] they can't find the bottom of the ocean
[47:40] and Jesus says he took my sins and he
[47:43] casted
[47:45] it says this must be the place
[47:49] now if you can see these types of
[47:51] Shadows
[47:52] and we are in the season right now
[47:55] amen then what is it
[47:58] now if you
[48:00] go to Google
[48:02] when did
[48:04] Nissan start
[48:08] let's go to the next slide next slide
[48:11] next one
[48:13] go so when does Nissan begin if you
[48:15] Google that
[48:18] no no some CPUs didn't catch it yet when
[48:21] did Nissan starts
[48:24] somebody said
[48:27] 23rd of March
[48:30] coincidence
[48:34] let's go back a slide
[48:38] back one
[48:39] so you know five plus seven plus eight
[48:41] plus three gives you 23 right
[48:44] so it's the year in fact it only works
[48:47] from
[48:49] 2020.
[48:51] because Exodus 23 verse 20 starts from
[48:55] 20.
[48:56] 223 talking about the angel of the Lord
[48:59] I hope you catch it people amen I wish I
[49:02] could download the Revelation into you
[49:04] but
[49:05] from 2020 what has happened
[49:11] so go read Exodus 23 verse 20 to 23.
[49:16] we're in the 23rd year and in the 20th
[49:18] years before I send my angel before thee
[49:21] and he's going to drive out all of these
[49:22] people
[49:24] right so it's the Hebrew New Year
[49:27] 23 but also in the solar calendar it's
[49:30] also the year 23.
[49:34] in the second Millennium after Jesus
[49:37] follow me a millennium is a thousand
[49:38] years
[49:40] the second two thousand years after
[49:42] Jesus 23 years after the second
[49:45] Millennium is where we stand today
[49:50] and why in this year
[49:52] the proclamation Goes Forth you shall
[49:54] see the angel of the Lord
[49:56] this shall be the most Supernatural here
[49:58] for the church
[50:00] you were here in all the meetings
[50:02] amen
[50:04] this shall be the most Supernatural year
[50:06] for the church amen hallelujah now if we
[50:09] go back to slide 49 there's also
[50:11] something that tied to you and me here I
[50:14] don't know what inspired brother Joshua
[50:16] to do this it wasn't me now
[50:19] so while I'm reading this and I was so
[50:22] excited and I'm reading that 23rd March
[50:25] started this Nissan
[50:26] everybody caught that that this year
[50:29] 23rd March
[50:32] started the new year
[50:37] then the spirit tells me go see when
[50:40] Nissan started in 2021
[50:45] and I was shocked it like blew the socks
[50:47] off of me
[50:49] because these things were not planned
[50:52] this was divinely orchestrated Amen
[50:55] brother Joshua chose the date
[50:58] we got brother Becca to come you can see
[51:00] there it's confirming yeah
[51:02] and on this coming Sunday March 14 2021
[51:05] we will welcome what is perhaps the most
[51:08] important month in the Hebrew calendar
[51:10] which is Nissan
[51:12] what happened on 14 March
[51:17] I'm just showing you how God can tie
[51:19] things together supernaturally
[51:24] amen so what was that
[51:28] new season
[51:30] amen a new season being Bliss
[51:33] amen what is it wasn't it a new season
[51:36] amen when Joshua had to take the people
[51:38] into the promised land what was
[51:39] nehemiah's Commission on the same date
[51:41] did we not read the prophet go back two
[51:43] quotes
[51:45] back to that quote 14 March
[51:47] did we not read here where he says 14th
[51:50] March
[51:51] rebuild the walls of Jerusalem
[51:56] amen
[51:59] the message walls have been torn down
[52:02] but the people raising up to rebuild the
[52:04] walls
[52:05] Nehemiah didn't build it alone
[52:07] this is not a one-man Ministry the
[52:10] people rose up with Nehemiah so read
[52:12] Nehemiah the Common People amen were
[52:15] empowered to rebuild the walls
[52:18] amen they came against opposition and
[52:20] persecution
[52:22] they had to rebuild the walls the Bible
[52:24] says in trouble sometimes if there's
[52:26] ever more trouble sometime than now then
[52:28] you tell me
[52:31] we're rebuilding during Troublesome time
[52:33] I'm not making anything to that I just
[52:34] thought I'll show you that because it
[52:36] was very significant that Nissan first
[52:39] of Nissan in 2021 was the 14th of March
[52:43] you will ask for the Joshua why he chose
[52:45] a date
[52:47] amen and he wants he can't tell you that
[52:50] he studied all of these things and he
[52:51] saw it was a prophetic date and you know
[52:53] all of these things
[52:54] brother Joshua won't lie to you
[52:56] amen
[53:00] so I want you
[53:02] to hear what the prophet is saying now
[53:04] in this quote
[53:07] I want you to get built up now in this
[53:09] holy Oracles of God
[53:13] what is it the revelation of the hour
[53:15] what message is he preaching this
[53:16] spiritual food in due season
[53:19] so he's telling you all of these things
[53:21] I'm feeding you because Faith cometh by
[53:22] the hearing of the word right so he said
[53:24] I'm storing up the food I want you to
[53:26] get built up on the holy Oracles of God
[53:29] in the faith the faith of this hour amen
[53:34] it's going to take more faith than ever
[53:37] was in any age
[53:40] for this has to be rapturing faith be
[53:43] taken up
[53:46] amen hallelujah
[53:49] and that's where I want to stop
[53:52] I don't want to give you too much to
[53:53] digest
[53:54] I want you to eat in small portions but
[53:57] you're still going to play something now
[53:58] for you because we are watching the
[54:01] angel of God Speak
[54:03] in a way in almost every service that it
[54:07] sometimes it's true for us to catch up
[54:10] to keep up
[54:12] am I right you're going to meetings
[54:15] innocently and you're getting bombarded
[54:16] [Music]
[54:19] you're going sitting there innocently
[54:21] and a speaker from somewhere else he's
[54:23] just speaking things right in line to
[54:25] throwing bombs
[54:27] hey
[54:30] we experienced that in the last week
[54:33] so what are we preaching 2023 it's time
[54:36] to manifest the revelation of the hour
[54:39] the time this
[54:43] is vicarious
[54:44] I don't know if I carry these things
[54:45] yeah you see me I'm a very practical
[54:48] person you see all my notes
[54:53] I've got so much more to show you tied
[54:55] to that number but I keep it with me
[54:58] so every chance I get every spare time
[55:01] I read it
[55:02] amen
[55:06] so we were sitting in this youth meeting
[55:11] and I'll I'll post the uh video up on
[55:15] our website I'm sure some of you want to
[55:17] hear the youth meeting right
[55:19] brother Adrian Grace testimony you can
[55:22] relax now I'm done preaching let's give
[55:24] the Lord a good example praise
[55:27] amen I think there was enough Revelation
[55:30] there
[55:32] to fill you up this morning
[55:34] amen
[55:36] so here we are sitting and we had a few
[55:39] witnesses there those of you that came
[55:40] to the meet to the youth meeting
[55:43] we sitting there
[55:45] and the brother is giving his testimony
[55:48] amen again brother submission is sitting
[55:51] next to me brother Jeff are they sitting
[55:52] there brother Joshua is sitting behind
[55:54] the Tyson is sitting next to me yeah
[55:57] so we'll end up planning to video this
[55:59] thing
[56:00] everything was being done and audio
[56:02] stream but something tells me pick up
[56:04] your phone and record and I'm thinking
[56:06] in my head hey my sister I'm going to
[56:09] record this thing I must hold it in my
[56:10] hand like this for one hour or two I
[56:12] don't know how long this brother is
[56:12] going to preach
[56:14] but anyway I pick up my phone
[56:16] and I stopped recording it some of the
[56:18] brothers must be thought I'm taking a
[56:19] little clip but if you saw me I was the
[56:21] whole time just there and my hand was
[56:23] shaky and I just somebody told me record
[56:25] these things
[56:27] amen and as the brother is giving his
[56:30] testimony I'm going to go to the clip
[56:32] now where you can hear it for yourself
[56:35] and that's why I recorded it and it was
[56:37] meant to be played here this morning
[56:39] and watch how that number pops up again
[56:43] now I want you to know he didn't know
[56:45] the significance of it
[56:49] the brother doesn't explain it
[56:51] even when we had lunch with it we'll
[56:53] answer them he didn't explain to us I
[56:55] told him I made clear prophecy to him
[56:59] and I told him exactly what it meant
[57:01] brother Joshua was witness to them
[57:04] and the brother we started to expound a
[57:07] few things based on that of the Angel of
[57:09] the Lord and you should watch like
[57:10] Revelation he says brother I see it
[57:15] he was like you know when you when
[57:17] somebody's enlightening brother Joshua
[57:19] you know that expression on his face he
[57:21] like couldn't contain himself
[57:24] and he said he's going to look into it
[57:26] amen so you hear it
[57:29] yes laughing and giggling there I think
[57:31] some of us were laughing because we
[57:33] couldn't hear what we couldn't believe
[57:34] what we were hearing
[57:36] amen so he's on his farm
[57:39] is busy bring work
[57:42] and he has an audible voice you are
[57:44] going to go to Russia
[57:48] right you are going to go to Russia he
[57:50] looks around he sees nobody there
[57:54] voice comes back you are going to go to
[57:55] Russia
[57:57] so over the time he's waiting for this
[57:59] manifestation remember he is not a
[58:02] famous preacher
[58:04] but the angel of the Lord told him you
[58:05] are going to go to Russia
[58:08] and you live from his testimony now how
[58:10] many years you took some of you already
[58:12] caught it by me just saying that how
[58:14] many years you took for you to come to
[58:16] pass and watch how innocently he's
[58:17] telling it but I tell you when he
[58:19] mentioned that
[58:20] like bombs were dropping on us because
[58:22] that's the inspiration of the album
[58:24] we're moving in let's just play that
[58:26] clip and then we're going to go to
[58:28] another testimony but I'll tell you
[58:29] about that testimony afterwards amen
[58:54] multiples
[59:00] on how much grasses on the certain that
[59:02] again not the Slime cooking problems
[59:06] and I can get an important because
[59:08] it's now important right okay you're
[59:11] going to Russia
[59:14] and
[59:16] there's no idea
[59:19] Force
[59:22] simply good one day if you're going to
[59:25] Russia
[59:27] then the voice of God and has stamped
[59:30] itself
[59:31] [Music]
[59:35] and
[59:43] what's your name is
[59:45] Russia
[59:47] so this is possibly
[59:50] so
[59:52] you think it disrespect him and it's
[59:55] been happening with the amount of time
[59:56] with God breaking the time
[1:00:03] you don't do what 50 years or 60 years
[1:00:05] it's just a couple of minutes
[1:00:06] waiting so
[1:00:08] taking so long
[1:00:10] it's kind of impossible
[1:00:13] so I'm going through for the next 23
[1:00:15] years
[1:00:17] not knowing that the place I'm going to
[1:00:21] is that from the time the Lord spoke to
[1:00:23] me to go to Russia was 23 years
[1:00:29] with a famous cooking through Stars
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:00:46] amen amen now that was just one right
[1:00:50] I'm going to give you a deep thought
[1:00:51] right now
[1:00:53] so this next one now
[1:00:55] was the last communion service we
[1:00:57] preached here
[1:00:59] right
[1:01:00] the last communion service we preached
[1:01:02] here some of you were here for the
[1:01:03] communion service I'm just giving you
[1:01:05] this clip because yeah I'm talking about
[1:01:07] Philip being transported and I'm telling
[1:01:10] you that we can see it again in our day
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:13] I got the clip I didn't need to put
[1:01:15] myself up but I wanted the people that
[1:01:16] were not sure to see the spirit speaking
[1:01:19] and telling you to believe for that and
[1:01:21] you're the brother in the same testimony
[1:01:23] he tells you
[1:01:25] I'm not going to give it away but you
[1:01:27] can hear his testimony amen
[1:01:30] I'm going to give you a deep thought
[1:01:31] right now
[1:01:35] it may be happy to swallow because I
[1:01:37] still am digesting it and I still want
[1:01:40] this power and I still want this
[1:01:43] this the spirit of God to work in this
[1:01:44] way I'm believing for it Philip is in a
[1:01:48] normal flesh body like you and me
[1:01:54] he's like how you are seated here now no
[1:01:57] different
[1:01:58] watch what the spirit does
[1:02:02] and when he came up out of the water the
[1:02:05] spirit of the lord caught Philip away
[1:02:08] that the eunuch saw him no more and he
[1:02:11] went on his way rejoicing
[1:02:15] amen yes how if you believe in the Lord
[1:02:17] can transport you
[1:02:19] come on believe for your church if we
[1:02:22] did it in the book of Acts he can do it

[1:04:53] all right
[1:05:02] that was as fast as it like that
[1:05:05] whichever is
[1:05:16] Catholics terrorized
[1:05:19] water Dunkin Donuts
[1:05:29] see when I see it brought icon
[1:05:41] so there's an up-to-date testimony
[1:05:44] now if God is mindful of a cow for those
[1:05:46] of you didn't catch it the cow was
[1:05:49] paralyzed because it got electrocuted on
[1:05:51] the fence but one leg
[1:05:54] right
[1:05:55] and it was giving birth to a car so he
[1:05:57] pulls the calf out the cop is dead
[1:06:00] so because that lake is paralyzed it
[1:06:02] can't move and there's a creek there or
[1:06:04] cliff and he's trying to get it away so
[1:06:06] he keeps it a few meters away
[1:06:08] but where it falls is like a huge dip
[1:06:11] and he says then the rain came and he
[1:06:14] started to fill that place where this
[1:06:15] cow was sitting the cow was going to
[1:06:16] drown
[1:06:19] and that's when he says lord I can't do
[1:06:21] this on my own I can't take the cow out
[1:06:22] of there and he says just you are these
[1:06:24] words he said like a bullet
[1:06:26] the car was shifted from there 15 meters
[1:06:29] away
[1:06:31] amen quickening power
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:36] now if we can believe for that if God is
[1:06:38] mindful of a cow
[1:06:40] if God can transport a cow
[1:06:43] quickening power can translate the
[1:06:45] musicians can come forward quickening
[1:06:47] power can transform it transport a car
