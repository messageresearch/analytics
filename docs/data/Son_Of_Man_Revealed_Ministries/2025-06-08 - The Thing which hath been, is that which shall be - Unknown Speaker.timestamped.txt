[0:09] Amen. We give praise, glory, and honor
[0:11] to the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords.
[0:14] Amen. Once again, it's good and
[0:17] privileged to be found in the house of
[0:19] God with God's people. Amen. We don't
[0:22] want to just be found in the house of
[0:24] God. We want to be found in the house of
[0:25] God with God's people. Amen. Because
[0:28] why? Each one stepping out of the family
[0:31] album. Amen. All that were in the
[0:33] thoughts of God, God had them in a
[0:35] family album and they now being
[0:37] displayed upon the earth. Amen. The
[0:40] great family of God. Amen. Coming to
[0:42] unity. How we are united through the
[0:44] word. United to the word. Coming in
[0:48] oneness with the word which is him.
[0:49] Amen. He is the word. Amen. So this
[0:52] morning we like to thank the Lord that
[0:55] we each one of us could be amen and we
[0:58] could come once again to praise and
[1:00] glorify his name. Amen. Our pastor
[1:02] Adrien is out ministering in the
[1:05] Ashville assembly for pastor Mvin. We
[1:07] pray that the ministry will be a
[1:09] blessing unto them as the Holy Ghost
[1:11] will as the same Holy Ghost that's here
[1:14] is going to be there and positionally
[1:16] place the bride in the part of the body
[1:19] that they ought to be in. Amen. Because
[1:20] we believe that God has blessed us with
[1:22] a ministry that positionally places each
[1:24] believer into his place. Amen. What what
[1:27] good would he do if we have the word but
[1:29] it doesn't put us in our position. Amen.
[1:31] The word comes to place us positionally
[1:34] in our own position. It's not good to
[1:36] say that brother is in his position or
[1:38] brother Brandham look at the way his
[1:40] ministry was and he was placed in his
[1:42] day but we need to be placed in our day
[1:44] in our hour that we're living in. Amen.
[1:47] Where God wants to use us. Amen. because
[1:49] God placed us here for this hour. He
[1:52] kept us for this part which is the final
[1:54] part. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. So,
[1:56] we got our Bibles.
[1:58] Um we'll just turn to one scripture and
[2:01] then we can have our seats. Amen. The
[2:03] book of Ecclesiastes from chapter 1
[2:05] verse
[2:07] 9. Amen. I got a quite a few thought
[2:10] this morning, but we'll see how the Holy
[2:11] Spirit brings it down and unfolds it.
[2:14] Amen. The book of Ecclesiastes, chapter
[2:16] 1, verse 9.
[2:19] The thing that had been, it is that
[2:22] which shall be, and that which is done
[2:26] is that which shall be
[2:28] done, and there is no new thing under
[2:33] the sun.
[2:34] The thing that had been is that which
[2:38] shall be. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[2:43] You find the Bible is expressly saying
[2:46] us what was must also be
[2:51] and which is done now shall also be done
[2:55] and there is no new thing under the sun.
[2:58] Amen.
[3:01] So now this is where I take my thought
[3:04] from. You know the prophet speaks about
[3:05] history repeating itself.
[3:08] Amen. Amen.
[3:10] The thing that had been, it is that
[3:12] which shall be. Amen. It has to be that
[3:15] way. Because when he's speaking about
[3:17] history, I'm going to speak about a lot
[3:19] of things. But the main emphasis I want
[3:21] you to have in the back of your mind
[3:23] this morning is the thing that had
[3:27] been what
[3:29] was when God created his son Adam on the
[3:33] earth. Amen.
[3:35] That was his son having dominion upon
[3:39] the earth.
[3:41] Having a son that could operate his very
[3:44] nature, having a son that could operate
[3:47] by his very
[3:49] attributes. Having a son manifesting him
[3:52] upon the earth when God placed Adam, his
[3:55] son upon the earth. Amen.
[3:58] Now we know in history repeating itself,
[4:01] we know that spirits don't die.
[4:05] We go through time, we go to history and
[4:07] we look at history, we find that we had
[4:10] certain type of dictators in history.
[4:13] But those dictators had to come to the
[4:16] end. But when they died, the prophet
[4:19] says those people died. But spirits
[4:21] don't die. Amen. Because spirits always
[4:25] need a body. Now you've got the spirit
[4:28] of God, which is the Holy Ghost. And the
[4:31] Holy Ghost was dwelling in his son.
[4:34] Amen. Dwelling in Adam. That was Adam's
[4:37] original spirit.
[4:39] Amen. Because the Holy Ghost has to have
[4:42] a body. And that body that was his son.
[4:45] That's why now when man fell and after
[4:48] 2,000 years, Jesus could come on the
[4:50] earth, the second Adam, which is the
[4:52] last Adam. Amen. The the second Adam and
[4:55] through him, Amen. could come. God could
[4:58] reconcile man back to himself. Amen. Now
[5:02] once again through him, God could come
[5:04] and dwell in him, dwell in that body
[5:07] again that he formed a perfect body
[5:09] which he could dwell in again to display
[5:12] his very nature, to display his very
[5:14] attributes. Amen.
[5:18] But now Jesus died for came on the earth
[5:22] for a purpose that is was to redeem man
[5:25] back to God.
[5:27] and bring back back man to his original
[5:31] condition. So he come to pay the price
[5:34] because the price was debt. Because of
[5:37] sin he brought forth debt. Amen.
[5:41] But he come to bring back man to the
[5:44] original condition. Amen. Therefore he
[5:48] says he's the first born of the new
[5:51] creation.
[5:53] That is why through Jesus Christ now
[5:56] comes forth a new creation upon the
[5:58] earth. Those that accept Jesus Christ as
[6:01] their Lord and Savior, those that are
[6:03] baptized in his name, those that are
[6:05] received the Holy Ghost and are born
[6:07] again are now a new species. They are
[6:10] new creation. Amen. The old nature
[6:12] passes away. Amen. And because why? The
[6:15] nature of Christ must be projected in
[6:18] and through you.
[6:20] Amen.
[6:22] And we find that all down through the
[6:24] age if it happened that in the through
[6:28] the after the first Adam there was a
[6:31] seventh from that first Adam. And that
[6:35] servant was Enoch. Amen. The Bible in
[6:38] Hebrews 11:5 says, "By faith, Enoch was
[6:42] translated that he should not see
[6:44] death."
[6:47] And was not found because God had
[6:50] translated him. For before his
[6:52] translation, he had this testimony that
[6:55] he pleased God. Amen. So the thing that
[6:59] had been, his death would shall be. If
[7:02] there was a Enoch from the first Adam,
[7:05] oh, praise God from this, there must be
[7:08] and Enoch was a seven from the first
[7:10] Adam. From the second Adam, there must
[7:13] be which is the last Adam, which is
[7:14] Jesus Christ. There must be that
[7:17] seventh. Amen. Amen. And there must be a
[7:20] people that will have that Enoch walk in
[7:22] this hour. Amen. A people that is
[7:25] walking translation in this hour. Amen.
[7:29] And that first Adam, what did he do?
[7:31] First Enoch, what did he
[7:33] do? He built a pyramid. We know God had
[7:37] three Bibles. One in the zodiac.
[7:41] One was a pyramid. Amen.
[7:44] That was the first Bible of stone. God's
[7:47] Bible in stone. Amen.
[7:50] And yeah, we're taking now lively stones
[7:52] now.
[7:54] Amen. The seven comes again after the
[7:57] seven church age. Amen. Lively stones.
[8:00] Amen. And Enoch was building that
[8:01] pyramid in silence. Amen. And this is in
[8:04] silence. Amen. Because why? It's an
[8:07] invisible union. It's a secret. Amen.
[8:10] The rapture is a secret. The rapture is
[8:13] not a public show. Yes. The shout went
[8:16] forth, but it's not for everybody.
[8:19] Amen. When the mighty angel comes down,
[8:22] science just said it's a great
[8:23] phenomena. It's a phenomenal cloud. It's
[8:26] a great phenomena. But they didn't know
[8:28] what was happening behind it. Amen. But
[8:31] behind it, Amen. There was a prophet of
[8:35] God there waiting for what? The seven
[8:38] seals to be revealed. Amen. Amen. And it
[8:43] what what does it do? It comes to bring
[8:45] us into a rapturing faith. It comes to
[8:48] bring us into a rapturing condition.
[8:51] That's what a shout does. Amen.
[8:54] He comes to take us because what is
[8:56] unbelief? Death. It brings for unbelief
[8:59] is sin and sin brings forth debt,
[9:02] spiritual debt. Amen. And therefore now
[9:06] he comes to take us out of unbelief.
[9:08] Amen. He comes to give us our true
[9:11] identity. Do not be caught amongst the
[9:13] debts. Amen. Because why? You should be
[9:17] amongst the living.
[9:19] Everybody else is dead has debt around
[9:21] them because they full of sin. And sin
[9:25] is unbelief. And unbelief breeds for
[9:28] death.
[9:29] So there's a voice crying out, "Come out
[9:32] out of unbelief." Amen. Come out of that
[9:35] condition.
[9:38] Praise God. Amen. And this voice, it
[9:41] brings us out. And this word that we
[9:43] receive now, it's able to transform our
[9:46] lives. It has a transforming power. It
[9:48] has a quickening power. Amen. Because in
[9:51] us was the gene of God. Amen. If the the
[9:55] gene of God was always in us, that word
[9:58] just had to come and quicken us. Amen.
[10:01] It just had to come and shine light upon
[10:03] it. Amen. Amen.
[10:07] Amen. So, we find that Enoch built a
[10:09] pyramid and we know that he went in
[10:13] there and then he was seen no more.
[10:15] Amen.
[10:17] So we've come
[10:18] now in 2 Peter 15:7
[10:22] says, "And beside this give all
[10:25] diligence, add to your faith virtue, add
[10:29] to your virtue knowledge, and to your
[10:32] knowledge temperance,
[10:34] and to temperance patience,
[10:37] and to patience godliness,
[10:40] and to godliness brotherly kindness, and
[10:44] to brotherly kindness charity. ity.
[10:48] What is the end result? Charity. Amen.
[10:51] And where it comes down when she nears
[10:54] the headstone. When the headstone comes
[10:56] one with the pyramid. Amen. It's the the
[11:00] headstone comes one with the body. There
[11:02] must be a oneness. Amen. Father, may
[11:05] they be one even as we are one.
[11:09] They must come into that perfect
[11:11] harmony.
[11:12] Praise God. It's and this is the hour
[11:16] where this body now is in perfect
[11:19] harmony with the word. Amen.
[11:25] When the word was
[11:27] rejected and the whole world rejected
[11:29] the word, what made you believe the
[11:32] word? Amen. Because there already was a
[11:35] God nature in you. Hallelujah. Thank
[11:38] you. You just have to be quickened.
[11:39] Thank you. Reminded of who you are.
[11:41] Thank you, Lord. reminded of what taken
[11:44] out of that amnesia shown who you are
[11:47] real what's your real nature. Amen. And
[11:50] therefore now it began to put you you
[11:53] began to put on a thinking man filter
[11:56] and you were filtering through the word.
[11:58] Amen.
[12:00] And then you your your your nature began
[12:02] to change.
[12:04] Your taste buds began to change. The
[12:08] thirst that you had within you that
[12:09] Satan took advantage of because you had
[12:11] a thirst thirsting for God. But Satan
[12:14] was taking advantage of that and he came
[12:17] and filled that thirst with temporary
[12:19] things
[12:21] that will bring you away, take you away
[12:23] further from God.
[12:25] But now God makes you drink from that
[12:28] inexhaustible fountain of life. Amen.
[12:32] from the living from the living from the
[12:35] from the from the living waters. Amen.
[12:38] And you having fresh mana all the time.
[12:42] So now that thirst is a painful thirst
[12:45] that you had. But when you find this now
[12:48] when you find something that truly
[12:50] satisfies this thirst, Amen. then your
[12:53] you your you your your nature begins to
[12:56] change. Yes. Amen. Your taste buds began
[12:59] to change.
[13:01] Amen. The things that you once thought
[13:03] that is going to satisfy you now, now do
[13:06] you realize that is contrary to the
[13:08] nature that you have, it doesn't agree
[13:11] with the spirit that's within you. Thank
[13:12] you, Lord. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. The
[13:15] spirit of Christ that's in you now makes
[13:17] you want to do the things of Christ.
[13:19] Amen. Makes you want to act like Christ.
[13:22] Amen. Makes you It bring you up to what?
[13:25] faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[13:28] patience, brotherly kindness, bringing
[13:31] to a stature of a perfect man
[13:34] kept with love with charity.
[13:37] Praise God. Yes. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[13:44] Hallelujah.
[13:46] Thank you, Father.
[13:49] Amen. He says,
[14:04] Thank you Lord.
[14:07] I think I put the wrong
[14:11] coaches. So we find that brother Ben
[14:14] Brandham spoke about history repeating
[14:17] itself right and God works in cycles.
[14:24] We know that God works in cycles.
[14:28] And we know that every 2,000 years, God
[14:30] does something. At the end of two, and
[14:33] this is now we've come now, the first
[14:36] two end of first 2,000 years, there was
[14:38] a
[14:38] flood. End of the next 2,000 years,
[14:41] Jesus comes on the scene. Then from
[14:43] Jesus to now, we had another ending of
[14:45] another 2,000 years.
[14:48] And then we
[14:52] had 20 in 2025 we have 25 years and
[14:56] pastor Adrian spoke that message about
[14:58] after 25 years what happens. Amen.
[15:02] Abraham had a promise for 25 years and
[15:05] by the end of the 25th year the promise
[15:07] was fulfilled. Amen.
[15:11] So we find that God works in disciples.
[15:16] What has been will be. Now God ends
[15:19] things the same way he started.
[15:22] Because why is the alpha and omega?
[15:26] Amen.
[15:28] So it's not two different things but the
[15:31] same thing but it's repeating in a
[15:32] cycle. Amen.
[15:34] And we know now we are living now. We
[15:37] can see right now prophecy being
[15:39] fulfilled and we can see the hour that
[15:41] we are living in.
[15:43] If somebody say that we've got a lot of
[15:45] time and they believing this message,
[15:48] I'm talking about for the Gentiles now.
[15:50] I'm not talking about for the Jews. I'm
[15:52] talking about with regard to the Gentile
[15:54] dispensation. If somebody believes that
[15:56] they still have a lot of time for the
[15:58] Gentile dispensation, they not
[16:00] understanding this message. They're not
[16:03] catching this message by revelation and
[16:06] understanding the hour that they are
[16:07] living in. Amen. If they still think
[16:09] that they got plenty time on the earth
[16:12] to carry on and enjoy the thirst that
[16:15] they had, the temporary thirst that they
[16:16] had, satisfy the thirst that they have
[16:18] out of God, outside of God's word and
[16:22] with temporary
[16:23] satisfactions, then they sure going to
[16:26] miss God's program. Right. Amen. Amen.
[16:30] God placed us in this age to meet a
[16:32] rapture. Yes. Amen. God placed us in
[16:36] this age to become that pyramid.
[16:41] Amen. To become what? That was a
[16:44] pyramid. God's word, first word in stone
[16:48] form.
[16:49] This must be God's word now in
[16:52] manifested form. Amen. Lively stones.
[16:55] Amen. Written and known. Read and known
[16:57] of all men.
[17:01] This must be God's word on display. Yes.
[17:05] Before we leave on the earth, God's word
[17:08] must be on display. Amen.
[17:11] And the final showdown on everything
[17:13] that we professing, everything that we
[17:15] are saying, we are saying, we keep
[17:16] saying people, God is going, there's
[17:18] going to be an rapture. God has sent us
[17:20] a message and a message is comes to give
[17:23] us rapturing faith and it's come to take
[17:25] us of this world because the world
[17:27] cannot uh exist any much longer. The
[17:31] condition of the world is such a in such
[17:33] a way that even now all nature is
[17:36] groaning and travailing waiting for this
[17:39] hour when the sons of God must be
[17:40] manifested on the earth because man has
[17:43] polluted the earth. Man has destroyed
[17:45] the earth and the world cannot take it
[17:48] any longer. World War I put the world in
[17:52] such convulsion. World War II took it
[17:54] even further. Imagine what World War II
[17:56] will do. The prophet said it'll take it
[17:58] out of Kater.
[18:01] Amen. But there has to be a renovation
[18:04] because God's three-fold purpose was to
[18:07] restore fallen Adam, to restore fallen
[18:09] Eve, the church, and to restore fallen
[18:12] Eden, the
[18:15] earth. And to bring it back to the
[18:18] original condition. Amen. If God is
[18:20] bringing his sons back to original
[18:21] condition, then there must be a place
[18:23] for his sons to dwell in. He's taking us
[18:26] in a rapture for a wedding supper. But
[18:29] we must come back to dwell upon the
[18:31] place that he created for us.
[18:34] Amen.
[18:36] And he created the earth in such a way.
[18:38] The prophet said that he made a variety
[18:40] of things. He made mountains. He made
[18:42] streams. He made all different things so
[18:44] that his children can be satisfied. But
[18:46] each each of us got a different
[18:48] character, different nature. We like
[18:50] different things. We have different
[18:51] choices. That's how God made his
[18:53] children. Amen. And he created the
[18:55] beauty of the earth in that way.
[18:59] But it's going to bring us back to that
[19:01] perfect Eden again. Amen.
[19:05] So now we are living in a time where the
[19:07] gentile doors must close. Amen.
[19:12] And if that is happening, if we are
[19:13] living in the time and history is
[19:15] repeating
[19:16] itself, then if there's a is a people
[19:19] that's coming in a if there's a people
[19:21] that's typing Enoch in the
[19:24] hour, then there must be a Jezebel and
[19:26] Aab in the saw. If there was a Elijah in
[19:28] the hour, there must be Jezebel and Ahab
[19:31] in the system. Amen.
[19:34] Now we find
[19:38] that in Enoch's time being the seventh
[19:41] he was
[19:42] translated. We the seventh from the
[19:44] second Adam we must be translated. Amen.
[19:47] Now he built the big pyramid the great
[19:49] pyramid which was God's Bible in stone.
[19:52] And how he did it? By divine revelation.
[19:54] Amen.
[19:56] Everything with God is by divine
[19:59] revelation. We all can
[20:01] take the word, the written word, and
[20:05] read it. Theologians read it, scholarly
[20:08] people read it, intellectual people read
[20:10] it. How come they can't see the things
[20:12] that you see?
[20:16] Amen. Because the Bible, this book is a
[20:19] book. He said, he said to Peter, "Upon
[20:21] this rock, I will build my church and
[20:24] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[20:26] against it."
[20:28] Because the church is built upon
[20:29] spiritual revelation. Yes. Amen. And
[20:33] therefore you find that if you are in
[20:34] the body of Christ, a son and daughter
[20:36] of God, you are get stimulated by
[20:38] revelation as the word is being preached
[20:41] when revelation projects to you. Amen.
[20:43] It stimulates you.
[20:46] Amen. It's satisfying to you. Amen.
[20:51] And you can never get enough of it.
[20:53] Amen. Amen. Each day with Jesus is
[20:57] sweeter than the day before. Amen. Amen.
[21:00] Ain't it good to be a Christian in this
[21:02] hour?
[21:03] Amen. Thank you, Lord. If there's any
[21:06] hour it was good to be a Christian, this
[21:07] is the best hour. Amen. Amen. Everything
[21:10] is reaching a climax now. Amen.
[21:22] Now we find that in the political and
[21:24] religious world there's also a
[21:27] union. In the days of
[21:29] Elijah, Ahab the political power married
[21:33] Jezebel which was a religious system
[21:37] and that union brought persecution,
[21:39] idolatry and judgment. Now we know when
[21:42] that started in America, the prophet
[21:45] said that was that started under
[21:46] President Kennedy. AB in the White House
[21:50] marrying with Jezebel, a Catholic first
[21:52] Catholic
[21:53] president. But now because we can see as
[21:57] things go tense now the union must be
[21:58] such it must drive political power not
[22:01] just religious power also political
[22:03] power which controls the economic the
[22:06] economies and of the world and things
[22:08] like that.
[22:10] So we now we know that United States the
[22:13] moral dy of United States was so much
[22:16] down under the previous
[22:18] administration. It became so low that
[22:20] they even became a laughingstock to the
[22:22] rest of the world cuz they were the way
[22:24] they were promoting these LGBTQ things
[22:27] and glorifying sin and so forth.
[22:29] Everybody knew that that wasn't a
[22:31] reflection of United
[22:33] States and the morals became so low and
[22:37] they became people didn't take them
[22:38] seriously
[22:40] anymore. But everything works with
[22:42] deception.
[22:44] Satan works with deception. This is the
[22:46] age of the fourth Os rider riding the
[22:50] palos. Amen. Poss means to deceive.
[22:53] Amen. And all the nations of the world
[22:56] must be deceived.
[22:59] So we find
[23:00] that if we look at the two beasts of
[23:03] Revelation chapter
[23:05] 13, it's what he's doing. It's unmasking
[23:08] Satan's end time
[23:11] strategy. Now other people didn't do
[23:13] that but a prophet. When the word was
[23:17] revealed, it was unmasking the entire
[23:19] strategy of Satan.
[23:21] No one else can do that. Other people
[23:24] were preaching different things. They're
[23:26] preaching the some people were preaching
[23:27] white house is Jesus Christ
[23:30] until the seals were revealed. Nobody
[23:32] could preach this.
[23:35] The prophet himself couldn't preach this
[23:37] in the way he could preach it until the
[23:39] seals were opened.
[23:43] Now we know Revelation 13 wanted to
[23:45] speaks about the beasts from the
[23:50] sea. We know that the two beasts will
[23:53] rise in Revelation 13. One from the land
[23:56] and one from the sea.
[23:58] So one from the sea and one from the
[24:01] earth. Right? Now we know the one that
[24:04] from the sea is representing paple Rome
[24:07] is representing Rome. But the one from
[24:10] the land you must watch the one from the
[24:12] earth because this one's going to be
[24:14] instrumental now in the end time because
[24:17] this one is going to become the
[24:21] mouthpiece for the first beast. Amen.
[24:24] The second beast that come from uh the
[24:26] land which is America, the United
[24:29] States, right? Is going to form this
[24:32] image to the first beast. So this one
[24:35] will give power is able to give power to
[24:38] the first beast because the first one
[24:41] now yes it had its power under
[24:46] paganism and and it showed this evil and
[24:49] everything then under papal Rome the
[24:51] medieval ages you know the story but
[24:54] let's look at the types now because what
[24:55] was must be spirits don't
[24:59] die under
[25:01] Constantine in 83 to Before Constantine
[25:04] come into power, when he became the just
[25:07] took over Rome and became the emperor of
[25:09] Rome, the Christians were being
[25:12] persecuted by huge
[25:15] numbers. They were fed to the
[25:18] lions. They were killed by gladiators,
[25:21] burnt at the stake and very gruesome
[25:24] ways. They were being
[25:26] killed, martyed for the gospel of Jesus
[25:29] Christ. Amen.
[25:32] And Rome was a pagan religion. Rome was
[25:34] a pagan place,
[25:37] right? They they had pagan worship in
[25:40] Rome. And even Nero, he burnt Rome and
[25:43] he blamed the Christians and they
[25:45] started persecuting them more.
[25:48] Then when Constantine was the emperor of
[25:51] Rome and he saw Rome falling apart
[25:57] and he said and he saw that the increase
[25:59] of Christianity. Amen. and said if I can
[26:02] just and and thought within himself if
[26:05] he could
[26:06] just get these Christians and the only
[26:09] way he could get them was to say that he
[26:12] was a Christian was to you know so under
[26:15] pretense he alleges that he got had a
[26:17] conversion he
[26:20] alleges but you know a conversion must
[26:22] show a life
[26:25] amen lot of people can profess to be a
[26:27] Christian a lot of people can profess I
[26:29] went to church. Come on now. We we we
[26:32] got to rec we can't be under the
[26:35] revelation of the word and look at
[26:37] people around us going today in
[26:39] gatherings in churches and call them
[26:40] Christians with the life they are living
[26:44] because their lives speak otherwise
[26:48] the people that you work with your
[26:49] neighbors your family your friends that
[26:51] you talk to that are claiming to have
[26:53] went church today on a Sunday and and
[26:55] their behavior on a Monday is contrary
[26:58] to being a Christian because a Christian
[27:01] displays Christ is Christlike. Amen.
[27:04] Amen. A Christian loves the word. Amen.
[27:08] Jesus said, "If you love me, you will
[27:10] keep my words and my words will not be
[27:13] grievious."
[27:15] You cannot love God and be in harmony
[27:17] with God in this hour and hate his word.
[27:22] So there's only one place of true
[27:24] Christianity and that's in the message
[27:26] of the hour.
[27:28] Yes. Amen. Everything else is unbelief
[27:30] because they didn't believe the word.
[27:32] They're unbelievers.
[27:35] That's right.
[27:38] So we find that Constantine alleg
[27:40] Constantine alleges that he had a
[27:45] conversion and then you know he he said
[27:47] he had a dream and he saw his crosses
[27:50] and then he and he painted the crosses
[27:52] on the shields of the Roman soldiers and
[27:55] they went have won a certain Noah and
[27:57] they claimed now to have had a
[27:58] conversion into
[28:00] Christianity and then instead of now
[28:04] persecuting Christians he told them
[28:06] listen
[28:06] You have been persecuted too long. Let's
[28:09] make Christianity the state religion
[28:13] and legalized religion. Let's recognize
[28:16] it.
[28:19] All your houses were taken away from
[28:21] you. You didn't have any money. All was
[28:24] taken away from you. But now let's give
[28:26] you houses. Let's give you
[28:30] land. Let's give you titles. Bishop so
[28:33] and so.
[28:35] give you money.
[28:38] Didn't that seem good? Come on now.
[28:40] after being persecuted.
[28:42] Let's go back to the Biden
[28:47] administration and the run-up to the
[28:49] election with
[28:51] Kamalis and and the universities in
[28:53] America and all the protest pro with
[28:56] this woke agenda promoting LGBTQ and so
[28:59] forth in the
[29:02] churches and the true Christians were
[29:04] being persecuted on the streets. Street
[29:06] preachers were you can't have services
[29:07] in America in the streets. They took out
[29:10] Christianity out of the schools.
[29:13] The children couldn't use the name. The
[29:14] people couldn't use the name Jesus. They
[29:17] were being
[29:19] persecuted. And Christianity, you
[29:21] couldn't mention Jesus in public places,
[29:24] in public
[29:27] offices. So now you get a new
[29:29] administration coming in with President
[29:32] Donald Trump. Doesn't that seem good
[29:34] now? Saying you have been persecuted too
[29:36] long.
[29:37] Christianity have been persecuted. Let's
[29:39] recognize Christianity.
[29:42] Amen.
[29:43] Doesn't that seem good?
[29:47] And then we know
[29:48] that Trump claims that he had this
[29:51] conversion. You know, when we when he
[29:53] had the shooting and so forth, he
[29:55] claimed to have this conversion. So, but
[29:57] doesn't it seem good?
[29:59] And then we'll bring Jezebel, preacher
[30:01] in the White House, make her lead the
[30:03] Christian prayer. Paula
[30:06] White, we bring Jezebel in the White
[30:08] House to lead. Doesn't seem seem
[30:12] good. Bring all evangelicals together,
[30:14] Franklin Graham and so forth. All of you
[30:17] come
[30:18] together. Doesn't that seem good? We are
[30:20] now bringing state religion.
[30:23] History repeating itself
[30:26] happened under
[30:27] Constantine. But yet this is where I'm
[30:30] going to
[30:31] now after he be he claims to have this
[30:34] conversion give Christianity all the
[30:36] good things but in AD
[30:40] 3:25 they form a council
[30:44] the nine council
[30:46] and bring forth doctrine
[30:49] bring forth that evil doctrine of
[30:51] trinity
[30:53] father son and holy ghost god in three
[30:56] persons
[31:00] bring forth this evil doctrine. And if
[31:02] you do not follow that that you don't
[31:04] come under this council, you are now
[31:07] going to this 1,000 years where the
[31:09] church is going to reign in state and
[31:11] religion is one now. It's united now.
[31:14] It's political and religious power
[31:16] together. But if you're not part of it,
[31:18] the persecution comes again.
[31:22] But now it's not coming from pagan Rome.
[31:24] It's coming from papal Rome.
[31:27] Yes.
[31:29] You get to where I'm going now? Amen. If
[31:31] they formed a council, then they will
[31:34] form a council now, the World Council of
[31:37] Churches.
[31:38] Then it was called the Nine Council. Now
[31:41] it's called the World Council of
[31:42] Churches. But this United States must
[31:45] give power to the image of the beasts.
[31:49] They will form this image and give power
[31:50] to it, the beast. How do they give
[31:52] power? performing this image and
[31:55] bringing everybody under this council.
[31:59] And if you are not under this
[32:01] council, how it's going to happen?
[32:03] They're going to bring laws in. They're
[32:06] going to regulate religion.
[32:10] Already we know to the to the previous
[32:12] pope, he've already had dialogues. And
[32:15] that started from Pope John Paul when
[32:18] they were having
[32:19] dialogues. And they've had all these
[32:21] dialogues with the Hindus, the Muslim.
[32:23] He said, even the prophet said, don't
[32:24] worry about the Muslims. They'll be
[32:26] swept in. He said, don't worry about
[32:28] communism and all. Worry about Romanism.
[32:34] So Dave now going to tighten
[32:38] things cuz he said when that remember
[32:41] the prophecy when the pope is taken from
[32:44] the USA, put over
[32:47] there. Watch now. Amen. You can see
[32:50] where we are now. There's going to be a
[32:53] tightening up.
[32:55] Amen. But nothing will happen to this
[32:58] bride. Amen. Because she doesn't go to
[33:01] She's not said she will go in
[33:02] tribulation.
[33:04] Because Satan only comes down when we go
[33:07] up.
[33:09] The two can't be here together. You'll
[33:11] never allow that. God will never allow
[33:14] that. Amen.
[33:17] But this is where they going to now all
[33:21] they call this confederation of churches
[33:23] they will regulate say you a church you
[33:26] having church in some school what
[33:28] affiliation do you belong to no no that
[33:31] affiliation is not part of sudden
[33:33] African council of churches would sudden
[33:35] African council of churches belong to
[33:36] the world council of churches so each
[33:39] country will have the council of
[33:40] churches belonging to the main body
[33:44] so what is this people you're call what
[33:46] message of the
[33:48] hour you all are not recognized here you
[33:51] don't belong to the southern African
[33:52] council of churches in South
[33:55] Africa now we we have to regulate you
[33:58] all because you can say hateful things
[33:59] to other
[34:01] religions you can say things that will
[34:03] bring hate
[34:05] speech and then you add this you know
[34:08] how Satan works now you allow all these
[34:10] other things to happen this terrible
[34:12] things that are happening by these
[34:14] apostate churches but But the churches
[34:16] now who don't even have doctrine, don't
[34:18] even have the word, who don't even have
[34:19] the fundamental word, spraying doom on
[34:22] people and so forth. So they will allow
[34:24] all those things to happen. You know
[34:25] why? Because they will use that as an
[34:27] excuse to bringing now to bring in laws.
[34:31] They say you can see what these people
[34:32] are doing if you don't regulate them. Or
[34:34] they'll have this cult cult leaders that
[34:37] will bring people and drink some kind of
[34:39] poison and kill themselves and say see
[34:41] all these things in history.
[34:43] If we don't regulate you all, what will
[34:45] happen? Why we need to regulate you all?
[34:47] Plus, if we regulate all, we'll give you
[34:49] land. You'll have your land to have your
[34:52] church. We won't interfere. You'll
[34:54] follow all the bylaws and so
[34:57] forth.
[34:59] So, what was must be. Amen. What has
[35:02] been must be. There is no new thing
[35:05] under the sun.
[35:08] But you find this and now we find that
[35:10] there's two
[35:12] beasts. We know that the beast coming
[35:14] out of the sea was the Roman power that
[35:17] took over the rest of all the powers and
[35:19] consolidated
[35:22] them.
[35:23] Right? So we can we find that this beast
[35:26] the first beast is representing
[35:27] religious political power of Rome. Amen.
[35:31] You know that even in
[35:33] Rome when they had World War II, I think
[35:36] it was, they couldn't bomb the Vatican
[35:39] any put drop any bomb at the Vatican
[35:41] city. Italy was under fire. You all know
[35:44] that. Italy was one of the exes, not the
[35:46] allies nations under Mussolini. And uh
[35:49] when they were bombing there, they
[35:51] couldn't put drop one bomb at Vatican
[35:54] City because it's a place where you
[35:56] can't have was there.
[35:59] That is why Zilinski was so wise and he
[36:02] had a meeting with Trump in the Vatican
[36:05] inside the
[36:07] Vatican. So you see where I'm going now.
[36:10] The the the this is where it's going to
[36:13] now that right now America was a joke,
[36:17] right? The United States was a joke
[36:19] under Biden administration. But America
[36:21] is no longer a joke now.
[36:24] Donald Trump has become the most
[36:25] powerful man on the earth right now.
[36:28] your your you your saw the way they
[36:30] accepted him in in Saudi in in the
[36:31] Middle East
[36:35] right now even your South African
[36:36] president went bowing down to him
[36:40] he went with his tail between his legs
[36:43] there and that's all the presidents are
[36:46] doing the same
[36:47] thing they might talk with a big front
[36:50] in their own media but behind the scenes
[36:52] they're going and cutting deals there
[36:54] because they know they can't buy or sell
[36:56] or trade outside the United States.
[37:00] Russia, China will also go there for a
[37:02] temporary
[37:03] period until the the time when Satan
[37:06] comes down until that's the time where
[37:07] the kings of the north go separately.
[37:10] But now they will all go there because
[37:12] you're not going to be able to trade,
[37:14] buy and sell until you're part of the
[37:16] system.
[37:19] That's right. And you all know the clip
[37:21] that we played to you all many years ago
[37:24] when Pope Francis sent this one priest.
[37:27] I I can't remember his name right now.
[37:29] Send this one priest to Kenneth Copelan.
[37:31] And what about his words? The protest is
[37:33] over. Don't call yourself Protestants.
[37:36] We all are brothers. We all are one.
[37:39] They use the same scripture.
[37:43] May we be one even as father. May they
[37:45] be one even as we are one.
[37:49] You see the deception of Satan.
[37:53] Amen. But it's
[37:55] time. All these things are happening now
[37:58] for a reason. Amen. So what the World
[38:00] Council of Churches will do, it'll give
[38:02] power to the
[38:04] image and they'll put people under
[38:06] pressure under
[38:08] because right now they they'll
[38:10] pressurize people to get into it. They
[38:12] put you know what sanctions are.
[38:15] Sanctions are good as someone is
[38:17] physically putting pressure on you,
[38:19] somebody physically taking you to war or
[38:21] something. They if they put sanction on
[38:22] you, there's nothing you can do. Tariffs
[38:25] are the same
[38:27] thing. It's also a form of war
[38:31] where they put a sanction on the
[38:32] country, the country is finished, the
[38:33] country loses the
[38:40] war. But what is our position in the
[38:42] midst of this?
[38:44] We won't go to tribulation.
[38:47] Enoch never went to the flood.
[38:51] Only when Enoch was taken
[38:53] up, dear Enoch, no one knew what to do.
[38:57] Amen.
[38:58] He knew the flood was coming when Enoch
[39:01] was taken
[39:06] up. Cuz why? We have to. We are now
[39:09] received the seal of God already. We are
[39:12] sealed up. Amen.
[39:14] But there must be a final enforcement
[39:17] of the mark of the beast. We are sealed.
[39:21] We are sealed away and be will be taken
[39:22] to glory.
[39:24] Because why? We must come and walk now
[39:27] into a statue of a perfect man. We must
[39:30] come into that perfect pyramid now
[39:33] because then you walk into glory. Amen.
[39:36] One of these days you'll be walking into
[39:38] translation. Amen. Walking out of this
[39:41] dimension. One of these days is feeble
[39:44] bodies. It'll be changing from mortal to
[39:46] immortality.
[39:48] Amen. That is why in this hour if a
[39:51] church is not brought to adoption in
[39:53] this hour. If you're not brought to
[39:55] adoption, there is no rapture. Amen.
[39:58] Amen. And how it started off God working
[40:01] first through the five-fold ministry. If
[40:04] ministers are not brought to adoption,
[40:06] how is the people going to be brought to
[40:07] adoption? God start first. He said you
[40:10] cannot go higher than your pastor. So if
[40:12] the pastor is not brought to adoption,
[40:14] the sheep cannot go.
[40:17] This is a very serious hour. This is not
[40:19] an hour to be playing religion and
[40:21] church and just claiming I'm just want
[40:23] to go have a church somewhere and be a
[40:25] pastor somewhere. No, you got to be
[40:27] called. You got to be thoroughly
[40:28] vindicated. You got to have the back of
[40:31] the desert experience. You got to meet
[40:33] the pillar of fire. You got to know that
[40:35] that you're walking with the angel of
[40:36] God. Amen. Yes, Lord.
[40:40] This is a serious hour, brothers and
[40:41] sisters.
[40:44] If there was a Enoch there, there must
[40:45] be an Enoch now. And Enoch had
[40:48] encounters with the angel of God.
[40:51] Amen. Enoch was not just living in a
[40:53] seen world. He was living in an unseen
[40:55] world. And that is why in this hour when
[40:59] you why you can have charity in this
[41:01] hour because what is charity? That is
[41:04] when the complete life of Christ is in
[41:06] you and displaying Christ. When you're
[41:09] displaying Christ, he's displaying his
[41:11] love. He's displaying his peace. He's
[41:13] displaying the fruits of Christ. Amen.
[41:17] And and how you have it is because now
[41:20] you're not looking at the seen only.
[41:22] You're also looking at the unseen.
[41:25] You are looking beyond temporal things.
[41:28] You are looking at the eternal things of
[41:29] God. Amen. And that's why when when
[41:32] Christ could walk on the earth, he was
[41:34] walking. He was living in a world of
[41:35] perfect faith because he saw himself in
[41:37] the scriptures. And he saw when he came
[41:39] here, I am temporarily on the earth. But
[41:42] I've come here for a mandate and I've
[41:44] come here for a mission and I got to
[41:46] complete my complete my mission upon the
[41:49] earth. So when you're looking at things,
[41:51] he wasn't looking at it temporarily. And
[41:53] we are here. We are going to make a
[41:54] rapture. Amen. We're not living on this
[41:56] world eternally here now. So when we are
[41:58] here, we know that we got to be about
[42:00] father's business. Amen.
[42:05] You got to be adopted in this hour
[42:08] because the final part of your adoption
[42:10] is a changing of your body. Amen.
[42:14] We would the redemption of our bodies.
[42:16] Amen.
[42:25] So we must be watchful understanding the
[42:28] political and relig religious signs
[42:30] around us. We cannot be slaughterful in
[42:32] this hour when all these signs are being
[42:35] fulfilled before our very eyes
[42:38] because prophecy fulfills itself by
[42:40] coming to
[42:41] pass. When it comes to pass it shuts the
[42:45] mouths of the critics. Yes sir.
[42:48] Because it comes to pass now. It's
[42:50] spoken of before it happens. But when it
[42:53] happens, it becomes history and the
[42:56] mouth of the critics must be
[42:58] shut. And just like that, the people
[43:01] that going to their mouths going to be
[43:02] shut when there's going to be a rapture.
[43:05] The people thinking what we talking
[43:07] about this rapture, rapture, rapture we
[43:09] talking about for many years. But
[43:12] there's going to be a rapture. We're
[43:14] already in the cycle of the rapture. In
[43:16] fact, if you're not in the cycle of the
[43:18] rapture now, then you're not going to go
[43:20] away. You're not going to be translated
[43:21] and leave the earth.
[43:24] How are you caught in the cycle of the
[43:25] rapture? You believe the shout. You were
[43:28] caught under the shout. Amen. You
[43:30] believe the message for your day. You
[43:32] not only believe it, but you understand
[43:34] you. It's revealed to you and you taken
[43:37] of the book. You ate of it. You become
[43:40] one with it. You become in a union with
[43:42] it. And you are manifesting it upon the
[43:44] earth. Amen.
[43:46] Thank you, Lord. Amen. You must be the
[43:48] lived word. You must live out the word.
[43:51] Amen. It's good to just read the word.
[43:54] It's not just good, sorry. It's not just
[43:56] good just to read the word. You must
[43:58] live out the word for your day.
[44:02] That is why you find that this true
[44:04] church will not
[44:06] compromise. She will stand with the
[44:08] revealed word.
[44:11] Amen. But we in a final stage of
[44:13] prophecy now. The beast are in their
[44:15] position. The image is forming. The
[44:18] image is formed already. It's only for
[44:20] it to now. It's only for it to now to
[44:23] operate fully and to bring the
[44:25] enforcement of it. We know America will
[44:27] bring the
[44:28] enforcement. America is the powerhouse.
[44:31] She's going to enforce
[44:33] this. Whatever Jezebel wants, America
[44:36] will enforce
[44:38] it. But the bride is also in a position.
[44:42] She's got the token on display. Amen.
[44:44] This is a flashing red light of his
[44:46] coming.
[44:48] Amen. The train is in the dark. Have you
[44:51] got your tickets on display? Amen. Amen.
[44:54] Have you got your tokens on
[44:58] display? Man, you can't be unaware of
[45:00] what is happening when the mind of
[45:02] Christ has come down in this age. Amen.
[45:05] And he's given us full authority over
[45:07] the
[45:08] enemy. Amen. All power that was in God,
[45:11] he poured into Christ. All that was in
[45:14] Christ, he poured into his church.
[45:17] All power. Amen. He poured into his
[45:19] church. So you carry the authority
[45:22] behind you. Amen.
[45:24] When you speak, that is why in this
[45:28] hour, you got to walk in perfect faith.
[45:32] You've got to walk in perfect love.
[45:34] Amen. Because when you speak, you got to
[45:37] speak at the way Christ speak.
[45:40] If you hate somebody, you can speak them
[45:41] out of
[45:43] existence. It's dangerous. The prophet
[45:46] had a test one time. There was a couple
[45:47] in the
[45:48] church. They was doing this immoral
[45:51] things in the church
[45:53] and he had a test. The angel of God said
[45:54] there will be a
[45:56] test. He could have spoke against them
[45:59] and you know what could have happened to
[46:00] them. You you'll seen that happening
[46:01] many times. But he said, "I forgive you
[46:06] because the power to forgive lays within
[46:08] you. Amen. Amen. No one else has given
[46:11] us power. The bride has given his power
[46:13] authority to
[46:14] forgive. It lays within you. But it's
[46:17] because you're not living on the earth
[46:19] bound. You're looking of you. You're
[46:20] you're looking at things from God's
[46:22] perspective. Amen. You're looking
[46:24] because you have become so one with
[46:26] Christ. When you speak now, Christ is
[46:28] speaking through you. Amen. That's why
[46:31] you can have genuine love for your
[46:32] brother and sister. Amen. Because this
[46:34] is the hour to walk. When when all this
[46:36] word is revealed, you're not walking
[46:38] puffed up and saying, "Look at what the
[46:39] Lord has said to me. Look at those
[46:41] people they lost." No, you are feeling
[46:43] sorry for them. I mean, how many of you
[46:45] went to an goes to people's funerals
[46:48] where unbelievers? Don't you feel sad
[46:50] when you know that person was lost
[46:52] because you have a revelation if they're
[46:54] not save?
[46:58] Or or you see a person in a sinful
[46:59] condition, don't you cry out for them?
[47:02] Because those that are full with the
[47:04] Holy Ghost and crying and sighing for
[47:05] the abomination of the lost.
[47:08] When when a it was revealed to Abraham
[47:12] that Sodom and Gomorrah was going to be
[47:14] destroyed, that Abraham said, "Oh yeah,
[47:16] they're full of sin. Destroy them." No,
[47:20] he began to plead with God. He began to
[47:24] plead for souls. Amen.
[47:26] Amen. So we know all these things are
[47:29] happening. how we should be pleading for
[47:31] our loved ones, pleading for those that
[47:33] are lost.
[47:38] Amen. Oh, you are just embarrassed to go
[47:40] tell them the truth of what is
[47:41] happening. Tell them our prophecy is
[47:43] being fulfilled. Tell them how late this
[47:45] hour we are.
[47:48] Have a casual just have a strange
[47:49] conversation with him. Said, "You know
[47:50] what? I'm going to be leaving you very
[47:52] soon. I'd like to have a conversation
[47:54] with you. Before I leave, start a
[47:57] conversation later. Get them shocked.
[47:59] Yes, sir.
[48:02] Tell them I'd like to have a
[48:03] conversation with you because I'm not
[48:05] going to be here very long.
[48:07] Maybe it'll get their attention.
[48:12] Lord,
[48:15] only this bride will have thus say the
[48:17] Lord. Amen. In this hour, many pro false
[48:22] prophets going out there, many people
[48:24] trying to impersonate prophecies and so
[48:25] forth. But this bride will have thus say
[48:28] the Lord.
[48:33] Amen. You know there this is the hour of
[48:37] spiritual
[48:39] famine where the world they'll even eat
[48:41] from a garbage can. The prophet
[48:43] said you know what I'm talking about.
[48:46] You go to people that profess to be
[48:48] Christians and you bring out a few
[48:50] things to them. See how they are just
[48:51] astonished at the things you're talking
[48:53] about.
[48:55] See how they they want to hear the
[48:57] things you are
[49:00] saying because why? There's no
[49:02] revelation outside this message.
[49:05] It happened in the days of Ahab.
[49:08] And Elijah when there was a a natural
[49:13] famine. Now there's a spiritual famine
[49:16] for spiritual food. Amen. But there even
[49:19] in the time
[49:21] of uh Elijah, there was a widow woman
[49:26] who was a gentile.
[49:30] Amen. And in the time there was a
[49:32] drought in the land. Isn't there now a
[49:35] drought for the true word of God?
[49:38] Not not in
[49:39] here. Not in the circles of where the
[49:41] word go. Not in God's provided place.
[49:43] Outside of God's provided place, there
[49:45] is a drought.
[49:47] Because where Elijah was in the cave, he
[49:49] was fed. He was supernaturally fed.
[49:53] Amen. But there
[49:55] was a widow
[50:00] woman. We
[50:03] know Ahab when he joined that cursed
[50:07] woman that
[50:08] Jezebel that's and she brought in idol
[50:11] worship. Then Israel turned from the
[50:14] word of God. And what happened? It
[50:16] brought about a
[50:19] famine. And so the land was under
[50:21] judgment because of the apostasy and so
[50:25] forth. And we know it was a corrupt
[50:27] union. God don't like corrupt
[50:30] unions. Amen. God don't like us to take
[50:33] his word and corrupt it with things
[50:35] outside his word.
[50:37] Amen. God wants us to take all of his
[50:40] words.
[50:42] If you are trusting God for something
[50:44] and you're praying about it, don't put
[50:46] your hands in it. If you laid it to
[50:49] God's feet and you wait, don't try and
[50:51] reason and try and use use your reason
[50:54] now for something that you already asked
[50:56] God for.
[50:58] Deal with it through the word of God,
[51:00] not through your emotions. God don't
[51:03] work with your emotions, not through
[51:05] your reasonings,
[51:07] and God don't work by your pity.
[51:10] Speak as a son and daughter of God.
[51:13] Speak knowing that you possess the
[51:15] words. Speak as one with authority.
[51:19] Don't let those negative words come out
[51:20] of your mouth. Amen. Amen.
[51:28] So you find
[51:30] that Elijah was told to go to this widow
[51:34] woman and he and he gave her instruction
[51:37] to prepare a meal for him.
[51:42] Amen. He said, you know, the prophet
[51:44] said, God never placed signs ahead of
[51:46] the
[51:47] word. Signs follow the word. Amen.
[51:53] As when Elijah told the woman to bake a
[51:56] cake for him first according to the word
[51:58] of law of the Lord. When she did as the
[52:01] word said, the proper sign came. Now
[52:04] people want to see the sign first and
[52:06] then they want to believe the word. No,
[52:09] no, no. You take God's word and God
[52:13] asked you to do a certain thing. Take
[52:14] God's word then see the sign. Amen.
[52:18] Come to the word
[52:20] first. Amen. People want to see a
[52:23] change. People want to say no. Let me
[52:25] see a change in my life. Then I'll find
[52:27] myself in the house of God.
[52:30] Let me see if I how you going to change
[52:32] if you don't take the word. The word
[52:34] changes you.
[52:36] Amen. Come to the word first.
[52:39] The word that you eating now, what you
[52:42] eat, you become. Amen.
[52:44] What you eat is going to give you now
[52:46] the vitamins that you need. It's going
[52:48] to give you the supplements that you
[52:49] need. Come to the word first and then
[52:52] watch the miracle.
[52:55] The seed word is energized by the
[52:58] spirit.
[52:59] So don't wait and say no let me get
[53:01] things right in my life first and we'll
[53:03] see how things go and then I'll come to
[53:06] church or right now things are
[53:08] financially difficult for me to come to
[53:10] church every week I got to find a job
[53:12] and everything let me get all that right
[53:14] first then I'll come to serve God no
[53:16] come to the word first
[53:19] put God first
[53:21] obedience is better than sacrifice amen
[53:25] so this widow woman is gentile at just a
[53:28] last meal. Amen. Which was typing the
[53:30] word. And she had a last oil typing the
[53:32] spirit. But she obeyed the voice of the
[53:36] spirit of the prophet. Sorry. She obeyed
[53:38] the voice of Elijah.
[53:45] Though she had that last meal, but she
[53:47] gave all
[53:50] because after that she was going to die.
[53:54] You must be willing to die to yourself.
[53:57] You must be willing to give all and come
[54:00] to Christ. Don't this is a late hour
[54:02] brothers and sisters. If there are
[54:05] things that are keeping you word bound.
[54:07] If there are things from your past that
[54:09] are weighing you down, you know, you
[54:11] need to forgive. You need to move on. If
[54:13] there are things past things that build
[54:15] up a complex in you, you need to go on
[54:17] your knees. First thing is do repent of
[54:20] your sins and then ask God to deliver
[54:23] you of that complex issues whatever it
[54:25] is from your past maybe way beyond.
[54:27] Maybe there was someone that hurt your
[54:29] feelings in your family or some person
[54:31] hurt your feelings. You need to forgive
[54:33] first and then you will be delivered.
[54:35] Amen.
[54:36] Thank you Lord. This is a late hour. Do
[54:39] not let anything weigh you down. Amen.
[54:42] You're about to take a rapture. Amen.
[54:44] Amen.
[54:48] So you find that she gave
[54:50] all. Oh my. So we find that she was
[54:54] willing to die and this is just for her
[54:57] son and her but she trusted God's
[55:00] prophet. Amen. She put a complete trust
[55:03] in the revealed word. She put a complete
[55:05] trust into be obedient to God's
[55:08] word. Didn't you do that in this hour
[55:10] that in this letter age? Amen. In his
[55:14] age of leucia, you put your complete
[55:16] trust in the revealed words. You left
[55:18] your denominations. You had to leave
[55:21] family tithes and so forth. You had to
[55:22] come out. You had to be persecuted. You
[55:24] had to be ridiculed. But you left
[55:27] everything to come to the revealed word.
[55:30] You put your complete trust in his
[55:31] revealed word knowing that this man is
[55:34] not even living on the earth right now.
[55:36] He preached this message in the
[55:38] 1960s. What makes me believe that?
[55:42] You put your complete trust in it. Amen.
[55:45] But now you are beginning to see the
[55:47] fruits of it. Prophecies are becoming to
[55:49] pass.
[55:51] Everything is falling into place. Now
[55:53] soon you are going to reap the benefits
[55:55] of it because all that you are eating is
[55:57] going to give you that body change. It's
[55:59] going to materialize. Amen.
[56:03] So obedient
[56:05] sustainer and the prophet during the
[56:08] famine. Amen. Because why? After
[56:12] She took the word. Then the sign came.
[56:15] Then there was abundance. Amen. It never
[56:19] run. The oil never ran out. Amen. The
[56:21] meal never run out. She had a meal every
[56:23] day. Yes, sir. She could be satisfied
[56:26] every day. Every day as your finance
[56:30] might be depleting in your economy in in
[56:33] sorry in man's economy, but in God's
[56:35] economy, in Jara economy, that finance
[56:38] will not run out. Amen. In man's
[56:42] economy, you might the doctor say you
[56:44] got a sudden sickness, but in God's
[56:46] economy, you already were healed. Amen.
[56:48] Amen. Healing is a complete work. Amen.
[56:55] We are not living in man's economy. We
[56:57] are living in Gyra's economy. Amen. He's
[57:00] my provider. Amen. He's my healer. He's
[57:03] my sustainer. Amen. Praise be to God.
[57:08] And we find that right now everything
[57:10] that we need is in the word. It is there
[57:13] to sustain us in this hour. It is there
[57:15] to keep us in our in a time of famine.
[57:21] Amen. So now people are in a famine for
[57:24] the true word of word of God. While this
[57:27] union right now of
[57:30] America, the Ahab system and the false
[57:33] church system, Jezebel once again is
[57:36] going to bring judgment upon the earth
[57:38] because why? They coming to a union now.
[57:40] All nations are gathering there because
[57:43] remember everything is focused. All the
[57:46] business deals they're doing is to
[57:47] benefit Rome. Everything that they going
[57:51] to do must benefit Rome.
[57:53] Every deal they made, every trade deal
[57:55] they made must benefit Rome. We know
[57:58] right now even Donald Trump with his own
[58:00] admission he rose in power and he got
[58:03] the popular vote. How? Through the
[58:05] Catholic vote. Protestants and Catholics
[58:09] brought him in the white
[58:11] house. So he has to fulfill that.
[58:18] So even in the time of Ahab if you look
[58:21] at it if you look at a parallel uh type
[58:23] now in 1 kings 17 it speaks about that
[58:27] Aab and Jezebel false union. Now we find
[58:30] America and paple
[58:33] Rome we had Malachi 4. Amen. She had
[58:38] Elijah the prophet
[58:40] there. She was a gentile woman. We are
[58:44] the end time bride. Amen.
[58:46] We've got the she had the meal word and
[58:49] the oil which typing the spirit. We've
[58:51] got the revelation and the anointing.
[58:54] Amen. We got the re it is the anointing
[58:56] that breaks the yoke of bondage. Amen.
[58:59] We anointed in this hour to keep us.
[59:01] Amen. Because why? He made us overcomers
[59:03] in his day. Amen.
[59:08] So God is asking us not to trust in
[59:11] man-made systems. That's right. God aids
[59:14] organized religion. He said, we know the
[59:16] first time they organized was in N in
[59:18] Rome.
[59:19] Now they're organizing again. God hates
[59:23] that. He hates organized religion. He
[59:26] wants us to be in oneness with him and
[59:28] him alone. He wants us to walk in
[59:31] revelation. Amen. What he's given us,
[59:34] the meal and the oil, that's good enough
[59:35] for us. If it was good enough for them,
[59:38] it's good enough for us. Amen.
[59:41] But they without us are not made
[59:44] perfect. Amen. Cannot be made perfect.
[59:46] Because why? There's ones that are
[59:47] walking in perfection in this hour. That
[59:50] are one that's coming to perfection in
[59:51] this hour. The ones that come to meet
[59:53] with the headstone. Amen. The one that
[59:55] has come with oneness with him, they
[59:56] will come in perfection in this hour.
[59:59] And then we know then that's the time he
[1:00:01] must call them out of the grave, out of
[1:00:03] the out of the sixth dimension. Empty
[1:00:06] out the sixth dimension. And we're going
[1:00:07] to see the loved ones come through.
[1:00:09] We're going to have fellowship with
[1:00:11] them. We're going to have a rejoicing
[1:00:13] with them. And then they and us will be
[1:00:16] caught up to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:00:19] Amen. Then when we gone in the wedding
[1:00:21] supper, that's when Satan must come
[1:00:23] incarnate into the current pope. Lord,
[1:00:26] Satan will be fully incarnated into the
[1:00:28] pope. Then they're going to see the
[1:00:30] dragon. Then they're going to see the
[1:00:32] other side. Now it's just deception. Now
[1:00:34] it's religion. Now it's pious, you know,
[1:00:38] but then they're going to see the other
[1:00:39] side of
[1:00:40] it. But it's too late then. Amen. The
[1:00:43] world will go into a tribulation
[1:00:47] then.
[1:00:49] So we speak about what was must be.
[1:00:53] Amen. What is will also be. There was an
[1:00:56] exodus then. There must we are through
[1:00:59] the exodus now. The angel of God was
[1:01:01] leading them then. The angel of God must
[1:01:03] lead us now. And that's where we find
[1:01:05] all these things. Amen. And they were
[1:01:07] taken to the promised land under the
[1:01:09] Joshua commission. We must go into our
[1:01:11] promised land. Amen. The Holy Ghost is
[1:01:13] the guide. Helping us read the benefit
[1:01:16] positionally placing us in the promised
[1:01:18] land. Joshua positionally placed them in
[1:01:20] the promised land. Amen. The Holy Ghost
[1:01:22] is here the guide positionally placing
[1:01:24] us. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:28] Leading us into all truth. Amen. But the
[1:01:31] final part of the pyramid is what? The
[1:01:33] capstone which is charity.
[1:01:36] Amen. That same headstone that was
[1:01:38] rejected in every
[1:01:40] age has now descended to unite with the
[1:01:43] bride, with the body.
[1:01:46] What was that? It's a rapture call.
[1:01:49] What it is? The token is being
[1:01:51] displayed.
[1:01:53] The train is in the dark. Amen. And the
[1:01:55] token is being displayed. is a flashing
[1:01:58] red light of his coming. The bride is
[1:02:01] becoming the manifestation of the word.
[1:02:04] Amen. How? From bride she changed to
[1:02:07] wife. From wife she had to have
[1:02:10] conception. From conception she had to
[1:02:12] bring forth the Christ child. Christ
[1:02:15] again upon the earth in a many membered
[1:02:17] body. Amen. Amen. Christ again walking
[1:02:20] in human flesh. John 14:12 doing the
[1:02:23] greater works.
[1:02:25] Amen.
[1:02:27] Hallelujah. So what it
[1:02:29] is charity in her it's make her respond
[1:02:33] like Christ. Amen. What makes you
[1:02:36] respond like Christ? What makes you act
[1:02:38] like Christ? Christ in you. The hope of
[1:02:40] glory. Charity in her. Amen. What makes
[1:02:44] you forgive? Christ in her. Amen. What
[1:02:47] makes you to endure? Christ in you. What
[1:02:51] makes you to love? Christ in you. Amen.
[1:02:54] What? It is the image of Christ now in
[1:02:57] his body.
[1:02:59] Amen. She is on display again.
[1:03:02] Hallelujah.
[1:03:05] She is him in another form. Amen.
[1:03:08] She is the pyramid completed.
[1:03:12] And he is the capstone ceiling her.
[1:03:15] Praise be to God. Amen. So what it is
[1:03:18] history is repeating self not just for
[1:03:22] fornowledge. Amen. but is repeating
[1:03:24] itself showing us showing us through
[1:03:27] revelation how God has worked through
[1:03:30] the ages. There was a Enoch from the
[1:03:33] seven the seven from the second there
[1:03:36] was a Enoch the seven from the first
[1:03:37] Adam. There's an
[1:03:39] Enoch which is from the second Adam and
[1:03:42] the seven church age. Amen. Which is
[1:03:44] ready in this hour for translation.
[1:03:47] We are that pyramid. Amen. Each stone is
[1:03:50] now in its perfect place.
[1:03:53] waiting for the capstone. Amen. Which is
[1:03:56] now come to us. Amen. We are the the
[1:04:00] widow feeding daily on the meal and the
[1:04:04] oil. Typing that you know what happened
[1:04:06] in days of
[1:04:09] Elijah. We had a Elijah who stood and
[1:04:12] blasted the Jezebel system. Amen. And
[1:04:16] the ones that comes now with the same
[1:04:18] message will speak prophesy again. Da
[1:04:21] must prophesy again before nation kings
[1:04:23] and tongue because you you have to echo
[1:04:25] the same words.
[1:04:28] Amen. We are like Israel in this final
[1:04:31] exodus led by the angel of God.
[1:04:35] Amen. That's the one that's leading us.
[1:04:36] It's the angel of God that's here. The
[1:04:38] one that was a prophet is here right
[1:04:40] now.
[1:04:42] Amen. But most of
[1:04:45] all, we are the body now displaying
[1:04:48] charity in this hour. Amen. Amen. The
[1:04:52] capstone Christ indwelling in us.
[1:04:56] Amen. Which is charity? Love himself.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah. Ready for what? The next
[1:05:02] thing now is going to happen is what?
[1:05:05] No. Before the before we go, there's
[1:05:07] going to be a
[1:05:09] resurrection. Christ is going to bring
[1:05:11] them up and we're going to fellowship
[1:05:14] with them.
[1:05:16] We shall not hinder those that sleep.
[1:05:19] They shall be raised up first.
[1:05:21] Amen. So, we're going to see them before
[1:05:25] we leave. We're going to go with them.
[1:05:27] Amen.
[1:05:30] So, they are waiting on us to come to
[1:05:32] this perfection. Amen. Coming to this
[1:05:35] time where charity is in us. Amen.
[1:05:42] So you find this hour once this pyramid
[1:05:44] is
[1:05:46] complete the angel of God and the angel
[1:05:49] of the covenant is here the trumpet
[1:05:52] shall sound and come to take us home.
[1:05:55] Come to take us to the wedding supper.
[1:05:58] Amen. While we are
[1:06:01] there we know what's going to happen on
[1:06:03] the
[1:06:04] earth. Not one bomb will fall. That's
[1:06:06] what he said. He talking about the
[1:06:08] atomic bombs. Not one bomb will fall
[1:06:10] while she's here.
[1:06:13] But the world is ready for World War II.
[1:06:15] But it's not going to happen. The angels
[1:06:17] are holding the winds. Amen. Of war and
[1:06:20] stripes. Wind is striping war and
[1:06:22] strife. The angels are owing the four
[1:06:24] four corners. Amen. Romans 8:9 says,
[1:06:27] "For the earnest expectation of the
[1:06:28] creature waited for the manifestation of
[1:06:30] the sons of
[1:06:32] God." Amen. Where the bride has now come
[1:06:35] to
[1:06:35] adoption and the hour of the third pool.
[1:06:38] Amen. Operating under sunship
[1:06:41] authority, moving where we taking the
[1:06:44] word and speaking the word, becoming the
[1:06:47] word.
[1:06:48] Amen. Preparing for the final part of
[1:06:51] the prophecy for us. Our final part of
[1:06:54] the prophecy is what? That we will go
[1:06:56] up. Amen. So, Revelation 10:8-11 says,
[1:07:00] "Thou must prophesy
[1:07:02] again before many nations, tongues, and
[1:07:04] kings. The little book is open. The
[1:07:07] mystery is finished. There's no mystery
[1:07:08] to be revealed. 107 mystery is finished.
[1:07:12] The bride is already eating the book.
[1:07:15] She's already become the word in flesh.
[1:07:18] The prophecy is not preaching sermons.
[1:07:20] No. The prophecy is living out the word.
[1:07:24] Amen. Living apostles. Amen. That's the
[1:07:27] prophecy. The lived words. Amen. When
[1:07:29] you're living
[1:07:31] out, that is the final declaration
[1:07:33] before the rapture.
[1:07:39] So this message has gone forth
[1:07:40] throughout the
[1:07:42] world. You know, I was just thinking
[1:07:44] about
[1:07:45] this. You never had
[1:07:47] a Oral Roberts doctrine or any of his
[1:07:50] doctrines gone around the world and they
[1:07:52] preaching the same thing or Billy Graham
[1:07:54] doctrine gone around the world and
[1:07:56] preaching those things. But here's
[1:07:58] William Brandham's teachings that are
[1:07:59] around the world.
[1:08:02] Amen. Because we know it's not him, it's
[1:08:04] the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. This word is
[1:08:08] around the world. I can meet a brother
[1:08:11] in some island. Yes, sir. Or in some
[1:08:14] montaneous area. And he will speak the
[1:08:16] same things like me. Amen. Amen. He
[1:08:19] might have have a different accent from
[1:08:21] me, but he will speak the same language
[1:08:23] as me. I'm talking about the revelation
[1:08:26] language that this world cannot
[1:08:28] understand. Because they have not known
[1:08:30] him. Amen. They have not become in
[1:08:32] oneness with him. But we have known him
[1:08:34] in the power and demonstration of his
[1:08:36] glory. Amen.
[1:08:39] Amen. Because we know now what has this
[1:08:42] world has been preparing us for. Now the
[1:08:45] confederation will bring a squeeze.
[1:08:47] Freedom of worship will be shut down.
[1:08:50] The third we said watch the third pulled
[1:08:52] in creative power in the bride. Amen.
[1:08:55] But there's no impersonation of this
[1:08:57] one. He said they have impersonated
[1:08:59] every gift.
[1:09:02] They impersonated all these other gifts
[1:09:05] but this is one thing they can
[1:09:06] impersonate.
[1:09:08] They cannot impersonate
[1:09:10] revelation. They try that is why you
[1:09:12] find them uh giving you know like when
[1:09:14] the prophecy they try you know as much
[1:09:16] as possible I gave away so many names of
[1:09:18] people so many numbers you know why they
[1:09:20] doing that why why they impersonate that
[1:09:22] because that's what happened in the
[1:09:23] prophet's day he'll tell them your name
[1:09:25] is so and so your address is so and so
[1:09:27] now they have competition you had these
[1:09:29] people they call themselves prophets
[1:09:31] they have competition I gave more than
[1:09:32] the other prophet I gave more than that
[1:09:34] person I gave more than that and they're
[1:09:36] all over Africa they got a lot of them
[1:09:39] but we had the true prophet
[1:09:41] In this day, he was a major prophet.
[1:09:43] Amen. He's come with the word. Now, that
[1:09:46] prophetic voice is in the bride. The
[1:09:49] prophetic voice is in her. She'll become
[1:09:51] the final voice in this final age. Amen.
[1:09:54] Let's stand. Trust you are blessed.
[1:10:03] I just want to give this last quote. uh
[1:10:06] he said so now I'm going to say
[1:10:08] something to you now that I haven't said
[1:10:11] all along and that is the thing that we
[1:10:15] have looked for so long for at least
[1:10:17] many years four or five years or maybe
[1:10:19] longer the third pool has now been
[1:10:22] vindicated and I'm sure you all know
[1:10:24] what it is now remember there'll never
[1:10:27] be an impersonation of that cuz it can
[1:10:31] be see it cannot be now it's inex
[1:10:35] existed and and are warned of this right
[1:10:38] at this time now. It just happened. So
[1:10:41] it could identify its presence among
[1:10:42] you. See, but it will not be used in a
[1:10:46] great way until this council begins to
[1:10:50] tighten up. And when it does, when that
[1:10:54] does, the Pentecostal and so forth can
[1:10:56] almost impersonate
[1:10:58] anything can be done. But when that time
[1:11:02] comes, when the squeeze comes down, then
[1:11:06] you'll see what you seen temporarily
[1:11:08] being manifested in the fullness of its
[1:11:11] power. Amen. Amen. That's your prophet
[1:11:15] speaking that. Amen.
[1:11:17] Amen. We pray that you've been blessed
[1:11:19] this morning.
[1:11:21] Uh before we call the musicians, we're
[1:11:23] going to just have a word of prayer. And
[1:11:26] uh maybe some of you, the Lord has
[1:11:28] spoken to you this morning. Oh yes. When
[1:11:30] you say Lord, I've realized now through
[1:11:32] this word
[1:11:34] uh how close and how late this hour that
[1:11:36] we are that we are living in a God and
[1:11:38] we know there's no new things under the
[1:11:39] son of God. Things are going on in
[1:11:41] cycles and we are now in the rapture
[1:11:43] cycle. Oh God. And father I want to have
[1:11:47] this closer walk with you. Oh yes.
[1:11:50] Let's pray this morning. Father we come
[1:11:52] to you this morning in the precious and
[1:11:53] holy name of Jesus Christ. Many things
[1:11:55] have been said this morning Lord and
[1:11:57] thou knowest why. Father, it's you that
[1:11:59] is in the hearts and intents of the
[1:12:01] heart. Father, and I pray this morning,
[1:12:03] oh God, is we know that your word that
[1:12:04] is sown, Lord, may be swn on good ground
[1:12:06] this morning, oh God. May your holy
[1:12:08] spirit come and be the after speaker,
[1:12:10] Lord Jesus. And if conviction is brought
[1:12:11] to any soul this morning, I pray, Lord
[1:12:14] Jesus, that they will have true
[1:12:16] repentance in their heart, oh God, and a
[1:12:18] true yearning for you, Lord. A true
[1:12:19] desire, Lord, to seek your face, a true
[1:12:21] desire to want to have a closer walk to
[1:12:23] you, Lord, and Lord. and and Lord each
[1:12:25] one may they yield themselves to you
[1:12:27] Lord and make an individual choice Lord
[1:12:30] Jesus to have a complete surrender to
[1:12:31] you Lord Jesus Lord that you'll have
[1:12:33] full control over their lives that
[1:12:35] you'll have the preeminence over their
[1:12:37] lives and have lordship over their lives
[1:12:39] father and I pray Lord Jesus that you'll
[1:12:42] work your perfect will in their life
[1:12:44] your purpose may your purpose may be
[1:12:46] revealed unto them Father this morning
[1:12:48] once again we thank you for your word oh
[1:12:50] God and we thank you for the things that
[1:12:52] you are doing this hour Lord Jesus we
[1:12:54] know Lord Jesus, we look forward to see
[1:12:56] you, Lord. Even so, Lord Jesus, come
[1:12:58] quickly, Father. Lord, we want you to
[1:13:00] come, Lord. We want you to take away
[1:13:02] your bride where you are that that where
[1:13:04] you are, we may be also. Blessed be your
[1:13:08] name, Father. Blessed be your holy name.
[1:13:10] Praise be to you. Thank you, Jesus. Amen
[1:13:13] and amen.
