turn to Luke chapter 1 amen I'd like to speak on another Mary bringing forth the word hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the Lord yes we'll read from verse 2 6 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women am amen amen so God had a specific woman in mind amen so just remember you are another Mary now and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold thou sh conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus amen amen hallelujah I want you to know right after the birth day amen that we the Mary of this day must reproduce The Life of Christ and we must bring forth Jesus in our lives amen and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee oh aren't we glad for the Holy Ghost amen praise the lord it's the work of the holy spirit amen and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God if we are to produce the Life of Christ the key is the Holy Ghost right he's going to bring it to pass he's going to overshadow us amen amen amen thank you amen hallelujah praise the Lord and behold th cousin Elizabeth now remember if you are carrying the word revelation is given to you right Revelation is given immediately to Mary who is going to be a carrier of the word and she's not to lay still with the name amen yes amen glory she's got to go forth with the name because there's a baby that needs to be resurrected to life hallah to us whom the Revelation the name of the Lord Jesus Christ has been revealed in this hour we are not to stay still with the revelation we have to go forth because somebody's waiting to burst forth into life amen you may be see that the Lord blessings to the reading of his word amen amen hallelujah God don't reveal things to us for nothing amen amen for us to keep our mouths closed and zipped amen but before we go on in our message amen I just want to go and go and go amen but I just want to have an announcement amen so amen it was with sadness in our hearts that we amen heard about the passing of our dear sister baby amen so we'd like to pass our condolences to brother Clive Amen brother Caleb's not here this morning amen and you know brother jaff and sister Kim macius amen so we pray that the Lord will be with him amen I haven't received the official uh funeral notice but from what I heard amen the funeral will be on Wednesday amen at the betesda the old betesda min Street if you remember the old church is that right brother CLI amen so if you know EJ mle's old church you know the old church in clayfield yeah amen so I believe it's starting at 10:00 a.m. once the official notification comes out we will forward it to you amen now it's important for us to honor the memory of sister baby because she was a member of the church amen amen you would remember she was a faithful member she's one of the earliest Believers in the church so she has been with the church for over 40 something years amen hallelujah and I'm sure many of you share many memories with her you'll remember having experiences with her having conversations with her but she was a mighty woman of Faith amen amen and she served the Lord Faithfully not a Troublesome sister a very quiet sister but just come and take in the word of the Lord amen and and we all know that at I think was it 2 or 3 years of age Amen brother Caleb was put into her care and she raised brother Caleb as one of her own Amen brother C would remember amen our mom used to bring her to church amen a faithful woman of God yes amen and bring all the children to church and fulfill a duty as The Fifth Gospel and train the children up in the ways of the Lord amen teach teach them the way they should go under the revelation of this end time message amen and in all these years I was trying to remember I can't remember a single time sister baby gave us a complaint or a trouble or a murmur or a groan amen hallelujah some of you that remember from the early days amen would testify to what I am saying amen so she she was a mother to us how old was mom when she passed was 80 exactly she would have been 81 amen now the Bible says and to everyone is given three score and 10 and if by virtue of Grace then 80 amen so we see she had extended Grace upon her life amen hallelujah and that is just the grace and favor of the Lord amen amen so even as we know our dear sister is rejoicing in glory a life didn't end in a feeble old body right her life ended victoriously because she entered a glorified body and Satan was defeated yes sir because she had the Lord Jesus Christ as a lord and savior amen so Satan couldn't hold that Soul Bound in hell right but she stepped into a glorified body in a young body in the Brilliance of her youth amen amen amen the prophet says between 18 and 21 the prophet says when he went over on the other side he saw the most beautiful young woman coming running towards him with flowing gowns with long haired amen and they came and greeted him our precious brother amen amen now believe our sister before she passed amen a daughter Sister Jenny had the message of the hour The Prophet's voice playing for her amen and I believe she passed with that tape playing amen amen and it's always a beautiful thing because it's a thought to consider could it be that the last voice she heard here on Earth is the first voice she hears on the other sideen amen hallelujah amen you know these things we preach is a reality amen there is another dimension right amen death is not the end you enter a body amen for those of you that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ have accepted him have confessed him with your mouth and believe him in your heart amen hallelujah accept to this glorious truth of the end time for the opening of the word the revelation of the Seven Seals amen the revelation of the seven Thunders to awaken us amen amen GL then we are not miserable people amen I know sometimes you yourself your character is a miserable one and and you can't get along with yourself brother brandom says amen but how about you put a smile now you in the presence of other people amen hallelujah say I want to get beside myself amen amen amen yes sir amen so amen so we have very fond and pleasant memories of sister baby amen and I want you to know that was the last time you'll see a sick feeble or old yeah one of these days when the resurrection of the Dead comes forth you'll see her in the BR of her youth am hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the Lord you know I remember she was here in April and uh you know they told her she had Alzheimer's and she was losing her memory and couldn't remember much things but maybe it's the grace of the Lord but when she came here she remembered everything she said she said to me this is my church and she says you're my pastor amen and we know amen that she was serving the lord Faithfully in this ministry under Pastor Ronnie for many many years until amen alimer got a old of her amen and then she had to move away to Petoria with her daughter amen so we just want to honor her life a memory a legacy that she's left amen so I was telling you you know never a day she gave us a problem never a day that I can remember the children may have gave a problems amen children may have give up problems but you know what brother Clive she always remembered her children in prayer she always had a desire for them to serve the Lord amen always amen and I believe the Lord will be faithful to her prayer amen and we know now she's United there brother Brian has gone on before amen always remember brother Brian because he built this book for us amen but he's gone on before so she's reunited with him and she's there with our pastor Hallelujah she's there with brother Sean she's there with sister Chinta she's there with sister Magi amen so son of man revealed Ministries if there's a name of a church there we got two branches we're two pastors one in the sixth Dimension One in here now you can decide where you want to be but just don't kill yourself right amen so praise the Lord amen so we have very happy memories of her and we amen I I just I should have done this while were standing but let's just stand together let's just remember our sister and you remember your father's memory of her amen amen and we pray that our soul will rest amen hallelujah in the dimension until amen the resurrection of the Saints amen power HS amen thank you you may be seated amen so we pray that the Lord will be with our Amen brother Clive and brother Caleb you know Sister baby is like his mom even though it's Granny but it's really like his mom because that's the only mom in knew amen growing up so I'm sure it's a very hard thing for him amen but you pray that the peace of God will be upon the family amen even over the funeral arrangements amen hallelujah amen that everything will go according to the will and purpose of God Amen and we can do our best to honor a memory amen hallelujah even as they call it the last respects you know when we doing these things and we pray that the Lord will be with him amen praise the Lord amen so after the service I don't want any of you to rush off even our visitors you're welcome to join us for a meal amen praise the Lord and we give thanks to the Lord amen so we don't want to be Pharisees right Jesus rebuked the Pharisees amen now there's nobody can lie to us or deceive us into telling us that Jesus was born on the 25th of December 100% amen anybody believe Jesus was born 25th of December nobody okay but we also mustn't be hypocritical right yes we can't say we don't celebrate Christmas and then we do things that because if tomorrow is a Monday and you normally eat vegetable on a Monday that's what you should be eating right I hope you get what I'm saying amen amen because the Bible found it fit enough to record the birth of of Jesus Amen and it's quite detailed it's quite extensive I know it says that nowhere in the Bible it instructs us to wor to celebrate the birth of Jesus which is true but is it all the word of God that we want amen I ask you if you don't remember him at this time when in the year do you remember him truthfully now no FES when do you remember the birth because the Bible is extensive in and detailing the birth so you know the Jesus is telling us about how these Pharisees were saying we don't do any work on a Saturday on the Sabbath but yet the donkey fell in the ditch and they picked the donkey up so he says don't be an hypocrite he was plucking corn in the field so amen ask yourself what are you doing tomorrow if you're preparing turkey and you're preparing chicken and you're preparing a meal and you're preparing lamb what are you really remembering he is it a family day for you what is it but in all that you're doing I don't want you to be Hypocrites all right if you want to be truthful to the Lord and say Lord I prepare this mealia in remembrance of your birth even though it's not the right date then you rather be truthful amen I don't I don't I think we got some Hypocrites but I want everyone to be delivered here does everybody understand what I'm saying because like I said nobody can deceive us to tell us Jesus was born on the 25th of December amen we had a Vindicated Prophet who came and taught us these things amen amen so if you're going about your normal day and you're just doing nothing then it's fine right Hallelujah but praise the Lord amen so we reading here and why I'm drawing this contrast is because it's a good time to draw the contrast not to just focus on the birth and put him in a Manger December amen am amen but if you want to bring in present tense in 2023 then the word must be formed in you and me amen if that is not evident we are wasting our time yes sir amen we don't believe in abortions some ofth aborted the process of bringing forth the Life of Christ we don't believe in abortion yes so he was started a good work within you he's more than able to finish it amen hallelujah but you got to work with him you got to work with the Holy Spirit am amen hallelujah and we know amen the angel of God is amen hallelujah the holy spirit in the form of the angel of God and we find in every Exodus there was the angel of God moving yes yes yes amen when when when Moses saw the pillar of fire in the burning bush the Bible records it as the angel of the Lord in the burning bush amen go read your Bible again it's the angel of the Lord in the burning bush coming to talk to the first deliverer amen amen yes sir amen the same Angel of the Lord meets Mary amen amen oh yes Lord the angel didn't age Hallelujah the same angel now he has a sovereing thought the same holy ghost that raised up Jesus from the dead is in you and me amen can I get a witness here now Hallelujah yes Lord amen we Marvel at the life of Paul we Marvel at the life of all the Great Men of God but the same holy spirit that possessed their vessels and did great signs and wonders through their body is the same holy spirit that possessed you and me come on now yes sir the same holy spirit that was upon Peter that even the shadow healed the sick he the same Holy Spirit that's in you amen it's not in a weakened form the reason why amen you don't see the results is because you are not prepared to surrender your life to the holy spirit amen is everybody understanding what I'm saying the Holy Spirit doesn't come in measures of power amen the holy spirit is the same yesterday today and forever because the holy spirit is God that's right hallelujah amen and the Holy Spirit wants to do a work in you oh yes and in me amen the Holy Spirit now was sent to overshadow Mary thank you amen yes we find there now if you read in Revelation chapter 13 he tells you that the people who won't be deceived are all those names that were written in the book and the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world yes sir now I ask you what need is there for God to have this in the back part of his mind that the lamb is slain before the foundation of the world if he didn't already have the thoughts of the Fall amen yes Hallelujah why would he make preparation for a lamb to be slain if he didn't have full knowledge of the four yes yes sir yes he had four knowledge of the four so what if couldn't produce you and I must produce now amen hallelujah oh yes amen amen amen he fell in Eden but we won't fall in Satan's Eden glory amen prise amen amen I'm saying it again Eve fell in Eden but we won't fall in Satan's Eden Hallelujah we are designed differently amen because we had a proper birth amen we've come through three stages justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost amen yes sir so the angel I was telling you the progression from Moses yet to Mary to tell her about how she's going to bring forth the Lord's Christ and there the L amen coming now to Jesus who's going to lead that second Exodus the same holy spirit that overshadowed Mary he's the same holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost and B the church amen amen yes the first time it fell upon Mary it brought forth a physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ and what is that body it is God in flesh you can't tell me different we have received the revelation of the age amen because Revelation 10:7 has sounded in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished Hallelujah the mystery is finished if you don't believe Jesus Christ is God Amen then you are to luded we are not interested in seminary teaching we are not interested Amen in Bible College teaching we are a Vindicated message of the hour yes sir amen all that was in God according to Christ amen hallelujah the Bible says that the fullness oh I don't know how the trinitarians go around preaching their gospel because the there say there's amen a Triune being amen each one coequal with one another when the word of God declares amen come on what does the word of God declare amen hallelujah that the fullness of the God had dwelt in Jesus bodily hallelujah amen so if they believe in three separate beings Father Son and Holy Ghost all three beings I'm just showing you their point of view now yeah then all three beings existed in Jesus Christ that's what the Bible says the fullness of God dwelt in him am amen so the argument Falls flat amen yes right because the fullness of God is in Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen he was either all God or none at all Hallelujah he was either God in flesh or man died for us and Jesus is not an amateur God Jesus is not a junior God Amen God doesn't call Jesus Junior Jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father amen yes yes but can I ask you in the progress of time can you say if you've seen me you've seen Jesus that's where we supposed to be now amen all that was in God he pour into Christ all that was in Christ he pour into the church amen we must speed up the progression because the things of the world are fixing now everything's at his climax the bride must be at her CL climax Jesus in the climax of his ministry told them if you've seen me you've seen the father now they want to know where's Jesus you must tell them if you have seen me you have seen Jesus amen hallelujah Wonder this is the bright coming of Christ Hallelujah glory amen amen yes in the first coming Jesus had a 3 and 1 half year Ministry yes in the second coming you must have a Ministry on the earth we know it started in William gram when a son of man revealed the son of man but it didn't end there Hallelujah so the same angel I was telling you now I'm progressing in my thought same angel that came there to Mary same angel that came there to amen that came now to Jesus amen the same angel that came there to the upper room yes the same angel that met William brandom in the cave Hallelujah wonderful I came to tell you your Strang and misunderstood life that you want to take a gift of healing to the Nations amen amen amen hallelujah but I want you to know it didn't end there we now have Revelation 10 where this Mighty Angel is coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow above his head feet is pillars of fire my amen hallelujah pillars of fire speaks of judgment brass amen hallelujah he's coming Amen in a turbulent time he's coming in a time of Warfare he's coming when there's two beast on the earth yes sir Revelation 13 talks about two Beast one coming from the land and one coming from the sea and this angel coming down in Revelation 10 is so specific that he puts one foot on the land and one foot on the sea to suppress these two Beast Powers because he's got a people on the Earth Hallelujah yes Glory am amen and didn't he say they H up the oil and the wine amen amen so nobody can do you any AR nobody can touch you yes without getting God's permission amen if they touch you they need to be saved baptized Born Again filled with the Holy Ghost to be able to touch you because your life is so heal in Christ hallelujah thank you Lord amen glory now it doesn't stop at 10:7 yes after 10:7 so now you can say your own story now how the angel came to me my god oh yes hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord yes wonder you can write your own autobiography amen how the angel came to me amen hallelujah because if you read from verse 8 to 11 then I heard the voice saying go and take the book from the end of the Angel and John has a conversation with the angel give me the little book am how the angel came to you amen yes oh yes amen you see before we leave this earth you are going to be Jesus manifested in bright form you are going to be nothing more nothing less you are going to be doing the Greater Works amen whether you believe it or not amen hallelujah if you don't believe it God's going to whoop you into place amen yes sir amen if right now you're moving in un believe believe me God and you the predestinated seed to bring this to pass you got a weapon coming your way to bring you into shape righten so you either come God's provided way or you go his permissive way where you're going to catch a beating my godallah amen you see Jonah could have gone easily to neva but he chose the hard way and now God had to provide transportation for him to get him to neva yes yes what am I trying to tell you in God's mind you already made the Rapture Hallelujah yes and if you're of out of line oh my why do you think brother Bram saw some people out of line he's going to scream out to you stay in line get back in line know who you are know fo you are know what you are called for this hour amen hallelujah you're not called just to be in some church amen to to warm a seat here amen you're called be part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ you are called to have the mind of Christ and the mind of Christ is the Supernatural come on amen that's a seven seal quote when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ he says Wonder yes sir now in the pergam church age he says here's the secret to this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary amen yes yes sorry so Mary had a physical seed within her you've got a spiritual seed within you amen hallelujah maybe I ask you this question how far along are you in bringing forth the Life of Christ am the image of Christ if you want to detail it the image and the life of Christ Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness Capstone of love coming down alha up Hallelujah well brother you know what some people really test my pyramid yeah they really test my pyramid and I know that uh my brothers and sisters are not going to see hell so I Tred to give them hell on Earth hey hey how far along are you in your pyramid are you you excelling at Faith amen excelling at virtue excelling at knowledge yes Temperance godliness amen how far long are you Hallelujah because Peter says if these things be in you you shall be neither Barren nor unfruitful yes amen so Mary had a specific she was called for a specific purpose now you find here even though the word was in Mary she was in the wrong location she was in Galilee so this is my point I'm trying to make to you now I'll I I'll I'll explain it to you God has thought about you and you ought to be conditioned amen and where you will produce this Hallelujah but you could be even right now you could have the word in you but you could be out of your position in your thinking amen right because remember what brother Bram said when the bride recognizes who she is what she stands for she can do the Greater Works she'll be an invincible Army so we're not doubting that you got the word in you but you could be out of position that's right you don't understand what you are what you are called for amen but that's what the 5old ministry is coming to do to tell you what you are called for Amen to tell you that you can do the Greater Works Hallelujah now you know anyone putting out military equipment must have test yeah they must run test they must practice military exercises are you practicing my God's giving you situations every day what are you doing about it we were preaching a few weeks weeks ago Elisha the Razer of all Debs amen some people caught it some people didn't my but didn't Elisha he raised the debt of that widow woman with the two boys that the bonds men had come to take them captive what did he do he asked her what do you have in your hand the Lord wants to know what do you have in your hand she said I have oil oil types the Holy Spirit she was Elisha now speaks to him to speaks multiplication over that oil and he says not only will you have multiplication over the oil but you shall have excess because you shall sell what you have and you shall live off the excess my my Hallelujah yeah sister Maggie was telling us a neighbor was in how much 40 something thousand Grand in debt for the electricity bill right now who's Elisha according to William brandom oh yes who is Elisha the bride you and me Hallelujah hello yes amen double portion anointing elishah Ministry is you so you know you the testimony it's on the group you can see it amen hallelujah how they said the prayer about it that debt went from being 44,000 to how much 13,000 in credit was that the right amount 18,000 in credit amen so who's the Eraser of all debts so God's giving you military exercises to test your greater work power amen but you got to be able to recognize it amen hallelujah amen amen yes you got to move from crying to speaking amen amen what did the Lord tell Moses why cry speak amen now there's nothing wrong with crying amen but don't just cry alone speak amen even if you're crying speak You're a god of the Earth and the Earth responds to your voice that's right am thank you Lord how many if you have seen in the Bible God comes down on the earth and does things on the earth at his own will without the cooperation of man you show me amen show me in the Bible where God comes on the earth and does things on the earth without the operation of aen Hallelujah why God set a law in motion I'll make Adam in my image and he shall have dominion over the Earth Hallelujah so if God wants to do anything he doesn't violate his own law but he works himself in subjection to his own law that's why he has always been looking for men on the earth yes sir who would come in alignment with his plan amen when he couldn't find any man on the earth that's why he destroyed the Earth in a flood amen amen but the Bible says Noah found Grace am not that Noah was any better himself if you know what Grace means it's God's unmerited favor Hallelujah God could have killed Noah as well but God kept him alive because he found Grace in the eyes of the Lord amen yes we come here and we see after the flood God found a man who he could would cooporate with his plan Abraham a man who had have faith amen then we had another man in this time Bram all churches didn't want to cooperate with this plan they denominated he poured out his gifts upon Luther then they denominated poured out it upon Wesley they denominated poured it aart amen thata Street Revival they denominated around it yes amen the prophet says denominational Rivers had the Holy Ghost bound amen but he says the evening message loose the Holy Ghost Hallelujah wonderful yes and William branam would come in subjection with the angel of the Lord amenallah he Lear he learned some odd lessons along the way like lose his wife lose his baby but all of that was preparing him for a greater Ministry of how to be in subjection to the angel of the Lord so I'm telling you God will do nothing on the Earth but through man Hallelujah why do you think God has worked now so much to bring his plan think of his plan all that was in God he pour into Christ all that was in Christ he pour into his church through the Holy Ghost so now he wants to have dominion rulership in your life you see as much as you say if you have seen me you've seen Jesus Christ you you also need to have the grace to say it's not I that do the works but it's Jesus that liveth in me take no glory for yourself yeah amen know who's doing the work greater is he that is in me amen amen greater is he that is in me not as soon as the Lord uses you you saw what I did right amen amen the bride has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word amen amen yes amen so we're coming to a time now where the bride must be on full display amen amen amen you see every time anytime the word is in the bride there arise a persecution a will start changing laws the Roman Governor now don't we have Rome again on the scene anytime the word is in the bride there will come a persecution yes isn't there promise a squeeze to come why because the word is in a bride amen if you follow the progression of that story you'll see how even though Mary had the word within her she was out of position but God was shifting them back into position amen so he started to use political power to pass laws to bring her back into a position Amen Hallelujah Lord yes you see the bride was the bride was almost like off out of line but God used J Warfare yeah to make the bride realize how unprepared she was for the hour help where's the bride that can close the heavens open the heavens shut the yes yes I hope you get what I'm telling you yes could it be God's grace to us to show us you have the word in you but you're out of position amen was that the eye opener to show us because let me tell you let me be quite Frank a lot of people listen to the government yeah amen amen the L he was just happy to stay at home if it wasn't for some leaders who wanted to open the churches and get back in church and Worship the Lord because they know they don't want to violate scripture the scripture says we're two or more gathered together in my name they am I in the midst the Bible says forget forsake not the assembly together of the Saints amen and the prophet of God also tell us that they'll try and shut these uh churches down but you ask yourself how people were running and hiding people were happy some people are upset when the government said you can go back to church some never returned till they thought it was safe my point is this there's going to come a time when you're going to have to go against the government Hallelujah that's right Glory they're going to shut down so what am I trying to say you want to be a law- Abiding Citizen in a natural Kingdom but when it comes to the things of God you don't want to be a law abiding citizen in this Kingdom you see my father's economy is greater than men's economy amen that's right we can't only use him as Jehovah Rafa there's six other compound names we only W Rafa some only W Gyra but when it comes to being our protection our Banner our peace yes we don't know how to call upon Jehovah he is all he's everything to me amen amen hallelujah so think of why we've been given access to the Seven Seals to the opening of the word just to be highly revelated no God is fixing you into position again Mary was out of position he used the Roman law to get her back into the city that she needed to be so God can have things in his mind like how the Bible says before the foundation of the world but he can't keep it in his mind amen if he keeps it in his mind nothing will happen so he had to speak amen and he said let there be and he got the ball rolling to get all of his thoughts all of his attributes on the earth amen the reason why you are in your condition is because all of your thoughts are in your head you don't realize you possess the power of the spoken word yes amen yes you sit in your bed thinking about things you never put it into practice you never speak and you never command things amen wonder you don't realize that God is God of the heavens amen and God puts you as a God on the earth Hallelujah let him have dominion yes amen Sor amen amen amen so what am I saying take charge of your situation amen don't accept things the way they are and say oh this is my faith this is life things never ever worked out for me nothing good ever happens to me that's what you are speaking and that's what you're living in the Bible says death and life are in the power of the tongue amen and those that love them will
