TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this afternoon, oh God, and may your spirit brood over us, Lord, tonight. Oh God, we bring the sick and afflicted before you, oh God. Even as saints have come tonight, Lord, even being unwell in body, Lord, I know that you have already done the work of redemption. And Lord, healing is your chosen bread, Lord. And Lord, right now, we draw from that from that shelf of healing, oh God, from that grocery shelf of redemption that you've given unto us. We draw healing tonight. And Lord, we give it to your children tonight, Lord. May they receive it now in the name of Jesus. And I pray Lord Jesus and every other need that your children may have Lord. Those that are financial needs right now, we draw from that grocery shelf tonight. And we give it to your children in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever things your children have need of, may they come and Lord, draw from there, Lord. May they draw strength from you tonight, oh God, and recognize that they are yet to commune with you and meet with you, Lord, in the evening time. And that's the time of fellowship, Lord. Even as your prophet told us, Lord, Adam and Eve will play all day with the lions and like little kittens, oh God. But Lord, when the sun went down in the evening time, Adam will put his arms around Eve and take into Lord, have that fellowship with you, Lord, into the cathedral, oh God, because Lord, it's worship time, oh God. It's time to praise you, oh God. It's time to worship the King. Oh, blessed be your name. All praise, glory, and honor belongs to you, Father. We thank you that we could be gathered, Lord, once again in this fashion. And Lord, we give you the preeminence now in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once again, wonderful to be found &gt;&gt; in the house of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through the cold weather, may we find warmth in his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As you can see, tensions are rising. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh the prophet told us the time piece is Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Gentiles don't have a time piece. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the clock, the time piece is Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can see right now all eyes are on Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Tensions are there. &gt;&gt; And it's not by coincidence. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Israel is on the offensive. &gt;&gt; Is knew that there was going to be a threat. They It's like a believer. We don't wait and say, "Lord, we just wait and see. We know the devil is working. We can see the devil is working and we know what he's doing. We we are discerning the devil is working." and you stay quiet about it. They went on the offensive &gt;&gt; and they named the operation operation rising lion. &gt;&gt; It's not by coincidence &gt;&gt; because why? The second coming he comes &gt;&gt; as a lion from the tribe of Judah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So no true believer when he's discerning things are not going right in his life, things not going right in his family, is just going to sit back. &gt;&gt; They go on the offensive against him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And where they are dominating now is in the air. &gt;&gt; Believers don't fight the battle on the ground. Amen. &gt;&gt; We fight it in the air. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In heavenly places. Amen. And that's where we are today. In heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got our Bibles. We turn to the book of Genesis. Reading from Genesis 12:1. Amen. The glorious hour to be a Christian. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Genesis 12:1. Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will bless thee. So now in other words, God wants to bless Abraham. But what you must do? You must get thee out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And make thy name great. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that cursse thee. And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just one more scripture before we be seated. Turn to the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 6 reading from verses 14 and 18. The Apostle Paul is saying here be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For what fellowship at righteousness with unrighteousness? &gt;&gt; And what communion at light with darkness? &gt;&gt; Yes. And what concord at Christ would bile? Or what part at he that believeth with an infidel? &gt;&gt; And what agreement at the temple of God with idols? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For ye are the temple of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As God had said, I will dwell in them. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, God dwells in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And walk in them. Somebody say, "God works in me." &gt;&gt; God works in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will be their God and they shall be my people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's not just going to be anybody's people. &gt;&gt; He wants to be a people. He wants to be a God of who? Where they made him his temple where he can dwell in them, then he can be their God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, and he says, "Wherefore come out from among them." &gt;&gt; Amen. and be ye separate, say the Lord, &gt;&gt; and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, say the Lord Almighty. Amen. You may be seated. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to speak a little title tonight. Called out to be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we know that we are the call. We were called out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But what we were called out for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were called out to be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? They were blessing imputed unto us. &gt;&gt; Blessings that were meant for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were God. We were special class of people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We were God's. We are sons and daughters of God means that we always existed in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; We were part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had enriched blessings for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But we are to be called out from something that was cursed. &gt;&gt; Come come come out from the cursed thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we speaking on a message. Called out to be blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's good to say we called out, but called out for what? &gt;&gt; Just to what? Just to come and say we have a message just to be another church. No. Because while we are being positioned, we are positioning. The message has been positioning us for what? For blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The message, the shout has come to be positioning us for blessing. Now, as soon as you think about blessing, it's it's got everything to do with all good things. Amen. The Bible said all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what does it mean to be unequally yolked? What is Apostle Paul talking about? Now, we know that Paul is using a term. It's like a farming term, right? Because he takes it from Deuteronomy 22:10 where it says, "Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together." &gt;&gt; He's talking about being unequally yolked. &gt;&gt; So, it speaks of two different natures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, in other words, he's showing you here now in Deuteronomy, one is clean and one is unclean. One is obedient, one is stubborn. &gt;&gt; Now can you imagine being equally yolked with somebody in this because you are believing something and somebody else is not believing something. How can you be agreement there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One is rejoicing on his words. &gt;&gt; One is being stubborn. &gt;&gt; Don't want to accept this words. &gt;&gt; The word says be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The other one saying, "No, I can't accept that." &gt;&gt; They're being stubborn to believe it. &gt;&gt; They sing it there. &gt;&gt; They sing it there in the prince. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They sing in every part of the Bible there, &gt;&gt; but they still don't accept it. They're still stubborn. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's two different natures. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One is clean, one is unclean. &gt;&gt; Because why? One is of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One is not born again. &gt;&gt; Because when you're born again, now there's a change that takes place. Amen. &gt;&gt; God takes your stony art, gives you out of takes your out of stone, makes it out of flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He gives you a nature change. &gt;&gt; He changes your taste buds. Amen. &gt;&gt; Once you desired for the things of the world, once you desire to be like all the other sinners, your because why? In you, you had a thirsting &gt;&gt; and the thirsting was for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the devil took advantage of that. The devil pulled on the thirst and he started to give you the desires of the world. &gt;&gt; Because why? It looks nice. It looks desirable. It looks pleasing to the eye. But it only lasts for a moment. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The minute you partake of it, the devil makes a mockery out of you. &gt;&gt; He leaves you in that mockery. He leaves you in that corner. &gt;&gt; But the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're a son and daughter of God, if you are part of him, the grace of the God is always there to pull you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because all that belong to him must come to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows how to pull his shoulder out. &gt;&gt; The devil comes and he abuses you. He takes advantage of you &gt;&gt; and he ravishes you, rvishes your life, messes up your life. But the grace of God, &gt;&gt; you are to come with his transforming power. Oh, what a word that can take you. And though you were so abused, though you were so rubbish by the devil, though you were so you were in such a condition that everyone looked down on you, maybe you was a black sheep of your family and the people spoke evil of you and because they know what condition that you have been in because what is happening now? The devil is making a mockery of you. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something dear friends, the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God loves you &gt;&gt; with an unconditional love. &gt;&gt; He made a covenant with Abraham. I will. &gt;&gt; God couldn't lie on any man anymore. He saw man is in such a condition. But here he calls out Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he gives the Abra instruction. Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we thought we had everything in this life. We thought we had things going. But one day, oh, the word came our way and said, "I get thee out from where you are. Get the art from every organization. Get the out from your worldly condition into the land that I will show you. Come into the land of the Holy Ghost. Come into the land of rest. The land where you belong." Amen. The land where now in this you can have peace. You can have prosperity. You can have joy unspeakable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in this land, you will be fortified. &gt;&gt; In this land, no enemy can come to you. The devil cannot ravish you. The devil cannot take advantage of you because why? You are fortified under my words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I will bless thee." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because he's calling us to us to be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. First thing he did was he called us for a total separation from unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we come out from all the unbelief, then he comes now and gives us his words. &gt;&gt; And we find honor and rich blessings in his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; The bless is an inexhaust. The the word as an inexhaustible fountain of blessings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? Every redemptive blessing is in there. &gt;&gt; Is stored up in there. It's rich with blessings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in there, he's going to show you, you are just not called to be have a temporal life. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; You are called to eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And all that you love, you're not going to have temporal fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; All that ever loved you, you're not going to have temporal fellowship with him. You're going to have eternal fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because why? You are special class of people. &gt;&gt; Your nature is different. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are now a fake civilization. &gt;&gt; You speak things though they were as as if even if it's not there. You speak as if it's already there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can take my word and say right, I have need of this and I'm speaking into existence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; didn't Jesus do that? Jesus they coming to collect tax one day &gt;&gt; and then they look at him the disciples look at him said no go there catch that fish &gt;&gt; in that fish what's there &gt;&gt; where did that money come from &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; thank you Lord &gt;&gt; he's the same yesterday &gt;&gt; today and forever &gt;&gt; amen so you find that Paul here is using this farming term because He's speaking of two different natures. &gt;&gt; You cannot be unequally yolked. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if we are together, if we are yolked together, that means if we the natures are together, the two can walk together. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The two are believing on the same word together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine coming now? Because when we come together in a fellowship, we must be together, one mind, one accord, one spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot be sitting in a fellowship where we are now unequally yolked together. Yes. &gt;&gt; One is believing in one doctrine, one is believing another doctrine. No, &gt;&gt; we've got to be yolked together. You got to come &gt;&gt; under a under the leadership of the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you've got to understand that the Holy Spirit is the one that is leading his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So you know the prophet said you cannot yoke a believer with an unbeliever &gt;&gt; without there being a pull or a resistance. &gt;&gt; You know one is like that stubborn nature you know a resistance from the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's like today a believer marrying an unbeliever &gt;&gt; or we going and joining denominations or joining a ecumenical system. No the word has already pulled us out. Yes. &gt;&gt; He already told us, he brought us into a different fold now. &gt;&gt; He brought us into a different covering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't even go there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Trust me, you can't go there. &gt;&gt; If you're already pulled in by Christ, no one can pull you out of there. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might go and try it. You might go in a little bit of a time in a back. It's called a backsliding condition. Paul said, "I backslide daily, but quickly you'll be brought to repentance." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very quick you'll be brought to repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you have a nature change. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; You have a different nature. &gt;&gt; You won't be making alliances with people that deny the word. &gt;&gt; Watch who you make your alliances with. &gt;&gt; Now when you when when you when he's calling us from separation, he means it doesn't mean we mustn't be around people. No, no, no, no. He didn't call us for isolation. But it means do not be yolked to them or unequally yolked to them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In other words, don't be influenced by them. That's right. Amen. But you can influence them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't form alliances with them. What is alliances? Allianc mean you are in agreement of things. &gt;&gt; You're in companionship. &gt;&gt; You can't be fellowshipping with somebody that keep denying the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Unless you know that God led you to this person, you now have to witness to this person. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. &gt;&gt; But if you are finding yourself very comfortable, it's like this. If you if I leave you in a with a person that's constantly using vulgar language, &gt;&gt; you will be uncomfortable with them. &gt;&gt; But if you are there and and you are able to tell a person, listen here, under my presence, you wouldn't speak this language. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the person respects you, then you'll be amongst them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you understand the principle behind it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You cannot be having this alliance with the people of the world. Right. &gt;&gt; You cannot be comfortable with the people of the world. Then there's something wrong because why? You are called out for their blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And you're going to be stopping your blessing. &gt;&gt; Because of this not being separated from them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not separated from the spirit of Leia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is positioning us for a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? This is the hour of total separation from unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the darkest hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. In an hour where the the through the fourth dimension influencing all over the world, it has such a strong influence &gt;&gt; in the homes of people. That's right. &gt;&gt; In the workplaces of people, &gt;&gt; it has such a strong influence &gt;&gt; because Fam mentioned it can influence people in a certain narrative. Yes, &gt;&gt; if people want to want to project a certain narrative, they can use the four dimension social media and so forth. And people can easily believe those things &gt;&gt; if they haven't had a conversion. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there must be a conversion. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you can bring the shyest person. &gt;&gt; That's why sometime you got to test if a person really has a conversion. That person cannot remain shy after a conversion. &gt;&gt; I think the prophet speaks gives a illustration somewhere about some sisters whatever when they were shy. &gt;&gt; You cannot be remain in a condition in that same condition after a conversion. You won't be able to not speak. &gt;&gt; You will be able to speak of the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; You will be able to profess of what God has done for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something about a conversion, &gt;&gt; Peter was denying Jesus. &gt;&gt; Three times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But after the conversion, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; After the conversion, &gt;&gt; he had boldness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the believers also prayed for more boldness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They wasn't the same people. &gt;&gt; People say, "Who is this person? This person, they couldn't even talk. M you might be a person just sitting here and maybe you can't even speak but trust me after you have a true conversion and the baptism of the Holy Spirit and anointed from God you your your people will be astonished at the way you speak. &gt;&gt; You might not be a preacher but they'll be astonished at the stand that you take for the word &gt;&gt; and the things that you tell them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is the hour of total separation &gt;&gt; and positioning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the call to come out from among the among them is not a rejection but it was an invitation to into inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we are called out from among them when that little eagle &gt;&gt; was stuck in the chicken barnyard when it was called up into so into the heavenlies. It was called for his inheritance, for his rightful inheritance &gt;&gt; because of who it was. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we were called out, we were called and coming into to come out from among them from the unbelief to come into our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz all this blessing, all this word is our blessing. It's our inheritance. The land of the Holy Ghost is full of our blessing. It's full of our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was meant for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. It might have been preached years ago when the prophet is preaching these messages, storing it up. Spiritual food being stored up, but this great food was stored up for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the table has been spread and God is using the five-fold ministry to bring it out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's a blessing to the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; So from Abraham all the way to the bride, the principle remains the same. God blesses you after you come out. And the coming out might seem hey okay I left my I left the world I left all that I believe the message now &gt;&gt; he's not that only it's a total separation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to recognize your pos. You got to come into your position. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to recognize who you truly are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You've got to recognize that God has a certain place that he wants you to be in. &gt;&gt; And only when you're there can you inherit all his blessings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't be where brother Adrien is. That's his blessings. &gt;&gt; That's his position. I have to be in my position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then I'm enjoying my blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might be called up for something else. You got to be in your position. And when you're in your position, you will enjoy your blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God has a position for each of us. &gt;&gt; So that is why the Holy Ghost is positionally placing us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through the five ministry. Amen. Positionally placing his children. And when they are there where they supposed to be positionally placed, they will enjoy the blessings of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But sometime they have to cause a separation. Sometime we go and try to fellowship because it feels sentimental. We have to fellowship with certain people or it just feels good. We have to fellowship with certain people. But God might say, "No, no. I need you here. I need you to be positionally placed here because this is where I want to use you &gt;&gt; and this is where you're going to have your blessings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we look at the pattern from Abraham. Separation unlocks blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It might not seem nice sometimes. It didn't seem very easy when we all had to leave our denomination and tell our families that we are believing this message and we believe a prophet is dead. It wasn't an easy thing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If you think of it, &gt;&gt; especially for sisters that when their families knew the the type of dressing they had and all and now they are conforming to the to the word and to the Bible and the way that the Bible teaches a woman to dress up and so forth. &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy. &gt;&gt; They had to suffer rejection. &gt;&gt; They had to get persecuted by their families. &gt;&gt; But something told them, something made them see that this is the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something made them seem, hey, &gt;&gt; people of the world, they calling themselves Christians, but they don't look like Christians. &gt;&gt; There's nothing different from the people of the world &gt;&gt; and the church people. &gt;&gt; They're all the same. If I go to a nightclub, the people dress up in a certain way. If I go to the church, they dress up in the same way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they never see a difference. M &gt;&gt; but when you came across this message &gt;&gt; and you realize that this is &gt;&gt; this is Christianity according to the Bible &gt;&gt; this is the old time religion &gt;&gt; this is the same religion that the apostles believed in &gt;&gt; because at that time then you then you began to realize that a message has come to turn your hearts to the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. So you realize now that as you started to come out and you started to conform to the word that separation started to unlock your blessings &gt;&gt; because why? Now at one stage in your life out of the Holy Ghost you realize that you was you was never satisfied in life. He was always thirsting after something and nothing could satisfy the thirsts and you was always an anxious person or you you're looking at life in a different way in a carnal to to carnality but now you find peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You find joy. Yes, you'll face all the circumstances. Yes, the devil will be out raging after you and you'll have all the situations that you'll face but you have this peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are settled in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you find comfort in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every time you come and read the word of God, you find that hey I'm in a different place &gt;&gt; because why? You are being seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; So you find that the the separation started to unlock your blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God could not bless Abraham fully. Now we know he left the land of earth but he was still with Lot. &gt;&gt; Lot was still hanging around. &gt;&gt; That's right. It was sentimental for him to keep Lot because why Lot is family. &gt;&gt; But there the whole God knows how to work things. &gt;&gt; Problem started to come. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Problem will always come with people in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the people of God, we look at things in a spiritual way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you live with the people of the world, you'll find problems in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you go to fellowship around the word and the things of God is different. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you're in a fellowship around fleshly things, you'll have problems. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So problem began to come. And what it was because God wants to separate Abraham completely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he wants to unlock Abraham's blessings. &gt;&gt; Because remember, he wants to make Abraham a great nation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He wants to bless him a separate person. &gt;&gt; And he want to make them a peculiar people, a peculiar nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. M &gt;&gt; so what God is saying to us spiritually separate from the worldly yolks &gt;&gt; separate from all system that is binding us together &gt;&gt; that's keeping us earth bound &gt;&gt; everything that's keeping us to live in a carnel &gt;&gt; everything that making us live in the flesh &gt;&gt; everything that's not making us move to the plan of God &gt;&gt; because why we are walking into the image of Christ amen &gt;&gt; we are walking to perfection in this hour everything that will stop us from working to perfection. We need to move those yolks. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So we find that when Abraham separated himself from Lot, then God could come and give him these full blessings. Amen. &gt;&gt; God himself could come down to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul is saying again, be not unequally y. What he means by that? We get people today you believing a certain thing. You have that opportunity in your life to now you believe this wonderful message. You a Christian you believe in God. Amen. And you know you you want to now come to that stage in your life. You want to find yourself a partner. And you're going to make decisions in your life. I want to have a partner. And then can you imagine now Satan knows that? You think Satan doesn't know that? &gt;&gt; Satan is going to present the best opportunities for you. Right? &gt;&gt; Because Satan works with what? Pretty looks only. He only looks at the outside on the outward appearances. &gt;&gt; God works with character. Satan give you the outward appearances. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't the prophet speak about Ahab and Jezebel? &gt;&gt; He said, "No way did Aab go and find Jezebel for the character &gt;&gt; because she was a murderer. &gt;&gt; No way did Aab go and find her." He said, "No, she must have been a pretty something that he went after. He went for the looks." Amen. So you find that you want to make these decisions. Now can you believe can how can you now go and find making this decision to have a partner that you're going to spend the rest of your life with? &gt;&gt; And if you're not and if you are unequally yolked together &gt;&gt; different natures. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then how are you going to balance the family life? &gt;&gt; How are you going to enjoy blessings of God? Because why? One is moving left, one is moving right. Oh, because you're supposed to work as a component &gt;&gt; to become together, &gt;&gt; as a family component. It's just like that in the church. Amen. We come as a in every local assembly. You know, the prophet said each assembly is sovereign, right? &gt;&gt; He's got a pastor who is the head of the church. And then you have the the believers. We must work as a component. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we are here, we are working. If you swear the brother is down, you want to you want to bring that brother to the same level as you &gt;&gt; because why? You want to move together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are walking in a certain direction. If the brother is going left, you hold down, you hold, you stop &gt;&gt; and then you go and you pull your brother's hand and you bring him, you build him up. You bring him to that level and you start moving with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? You are going to a certain direction. Amen. And then you take that brother out because you're finding out his brother now is he's is now not separated from the things of this world &gt;&gt; and now he's going to lose his blessings but the blessings are right here. &gt;&gt; But you can't go enjoy the blessings alone because the brother is connected with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you go and pull the brother's hand and you're walking with him and you're walking together. Amen. As a band of believers &gt;&gt; marking marching on as honorary Christian soldiers. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not leaving nothing behind. We're not even leaving a hoof behind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we find that we align ourselves with people that believe the same word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And each church must have doctrine, right? Each church must have. You can't have a wishy-washy church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can't have a church believing every wind of doctrine. No. You must be have a strong foundation and you must have sound doctrine. The Bible said you must have sound you must teach sound doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you have a church that not teaching sound doctrine, then there's a problem. &gt;&gt; Then you'll be tossed to and fro with every wheel of doctrine. &gt;&gt; But this is not a hour to be tossed to and fro. This is the hour to have stability. &gt;&gt; Amen. when the when the when the waves are roaring around you, you need to have stability in this hour. &gt;&gt; So church must have sound mat sound doctrine and if you if you are there then you can have fellowship around these things then you have fellowship around the word because now you know that the holy spirit is bringing the word and the word is you're not adding to the word you're not taking from the word it's the same word. Amen. He's just giving light to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's just bringing in the word that is needed in the hour that we living in. &gt;&gt; Because as we have need of things, the Holy Spirit brings it out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we are going through certain circumstances, the Holy Spirit knows how to speak to us. You might be saying, "Oh, but I'm sitting here, but how how is this thing pertaining to my life?" It's not man that speak. It's the Holy Spirit that speakth. &gt;&gt; It depends how you look at it. Amen. So you find that the wrong yoke can affect your walk. &gt;&gt; If you can fellowship in a place without sound doctrine or without proper doctrine, it can affect your walk because today you'll believe one thing and tomorrow you'll believe another thing. Amen. But if you got sound doctrine, this you'll walk in the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And your journey will grow by the grace of God from glory unto glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. And your journey will bring you into maturity &gt;&gt; because if you I can't be I can't look at the word that I looked at it &gt;&gt; 20 years ago when I came whatever years. Yeah. 20 years ago when I came in the message I can't look at the word the same way. &gt;&gt; No, I had to have a progressive walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It had to bring me to a mature person. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can't but look at a believer now and see him maybe after 5 years 10 years and the same time I left him 5 years ago he's speaking the same things &gt;&gt; he's like remind me of the the convention you know you you meet certain people in the convention the same thing they grumbled about in our last convention you see them now after couple convention they gamble about the same thing &gt;&gt; no change &gt;&gt; there've got to be a change what I'm saying there got to be maturity Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? They're not separating themselves to unlock their blessings. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And if they don't do that, they're not going to be in the right position. They're not in the rightful positions. &gt;&gt; A lot of people want to be other people positions. &gt;&gt; A lot of people who are not even called to be ministers want to be in ministers positions. &gt;&gt; Want to be handling ministers affairs. &gt;&gt; Things that ministers supposed to handle. &gt;&gt; Spiritual thing that that you'll have to call a minister to handle. You get people who are not ministers are handling those things. &gt;&gt; What is that? A man not walking in his own position. &gt;&gt; Yet if that same man walk in his own position, he can see blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can have the blessings of God and he can enjoy the blessings of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it making sense? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you find that there's many types in the Old Testament type of separation for blessings. Amen. When God called the children of Israel, he had to call them for a total separation. He had to take them out of Egypt. Take them to the water baptism. Amen. Take them to all the stick. They have to apply the blood. They have to apply the token there in uh and uh God had to now show them that you are a separate people. You are spared because you apply the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you you are separated by the token. Amen. That's what makes the difference. And then when he takes them out of Egypt and he totally separates them then now he brings his word to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he gives them the word &gt;&gt; only when there was a total separation from unbelief. &gt;&gt; So you might have come in the message all these years &gt;&gt; and the word is being preached and you listen the message but if you are not coming from total separation you're not going to receive the word by revelation. &gt;&gt; You're not living in a realm of revelation. Right? &gt;&gt; Because this is the hour to be living in another realm. Amen. &gt;&gt; In a higher dimension. You can't be living down here. You got to come up a little higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you haven't if you haven't come from total separation, you're not going to come up higher. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because only when they came into total separation could Moses go up and bring the word down. Amen. &gt;&gt; God doesn't change his ways. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what they had to have today we have the Holy Ghost token separates us from the judgment that's coming upon the earth. &gt;&gt; But what happened? Devil knows how to work things out. &gt;&gt; He knew that Israel had a word and Israel knew that they were different people. &gt;&gt; But what he did now? He joined them to the Moabites feast. Let's see what the prophet says about that. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. He brings them to a feast. Amen. Because why? He knows these people now I'm going to get them now and now I want them to fall. He says just what I mean look just he said just just what they wanted Satan's victory at the Moabai feast he's got another one coming too he's getting them all in the same way all at once just think of what they done same as it was it never had to take a great big long three or four years to draw it out. They the false prophet, the man that walked over the word of God, every warning that God had sent across the nation and told them, "Get out of it. Get out of it. Get out of it." They won't do it. They'll stay right there. They'll ignore the word of God. Ignore the word. ignore the signs. ignore the things that we're in. Go right on. We're going to have it anyhow. We're going right on over. We got to have it. He said see the folly of the devil. That's the same thing they did at the Nia feast. &gt;&gt; Now he's showing you from there &gt;&gt; what happened to now it came to na feast. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. At nia feast where it was in Rome they made an organization of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we know if it happened in there if it happened in mobile where they going to now they are going now into another council which is the world council of churches. And we know that the pro he says here, notice it was then when Moses stepped forth and said, "Who's for me and God?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It was then the Levite pulled his sword and went through the camp and utterly slayed everything that was connected with it. &gt;&gt; Everything. Every man that had a Moabitete woman, they killed them right together. &gt;&gt; Now the hour has come. Where is the man? Where is Aaron's son? Some of the priesthood that's willing to pull the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sharp two-edged sword. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are you saying? Where's the true servant of God that can take the word of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to call out what it is. &gt;&gt; To speak the truth of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not a shame to stand with the word and the word alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To slay every demon with the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. not to compromise with the word &gt;&gt; who stand for me and God where is he at can invite invite but nobody answers so what I mean we don't get it there's something wrong it was then that Moses stood up and said these things notice their sin that they did there in the Moabitish feast &gt;&gt; when they denominated themselves with Moab and made them one body &gt;&gt; you see now they unequally yoking themselves together &gt;&gt; that sin was never forgiven them. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm just going to coast on that just a minute. &gt;&gt; He said their sin was never forgiven them. Not one of them ever made the promised land. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in excuse me St. John the 6. Jesus said in St. John 6 when he said our fathers eat mana in the wilderness. They were Pentecostals brother. They eat the mana. They add the real thing. Jesus said, "And there everyone dead, they perish. They're eternally gone. Their sin was never forgiven them." What did they do? They broke their covenant with God and organized with Balum, the highing prophet that wouldn't take the one in of God. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't take the word of God. Wouldn't take nothing of God. But he was determined to get them all one. Can you see the folly? I could stay on that a long time, but I think you got it. Notice their sin was never forgive them. None of them that lived under those blessings and eat that mana and everything. So they had all the blessings, eating the mana, &gt;&gt; drinking from the rock, water from the rock and things like that. But what happened here now? They went to the feast. &gt;&gt; When the real true message came to a showdown, &gt;&gt; they organized it. Well, take we'll take Moabites and us together. They're a great organization, great nation. We're not we're not even a nation. We'll just marry among one another and we'll be all right then. We'll be with them. And he was never forgiven, never forgiven them. Jesus said that everyone dead. Translate that word in the Hebrew or Greek, either one. Or even in the English, it means eternal separation. Forever gone. That's right. Oh yes, they saw the miracles. They saw the word anointed. &gt;&gt; They eat the mana &gt;&gt; that come from heaven. They enjoyed the blessings of the atonement. They saw the smitten rock give it water. They drank from it. They were personally acquainted with it. But when it come to breaking that word, don't you never forget that when Jesus said, "I and my father are one." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't say there three. when all these other great fundamentals of the scripture. So if you take the same thing today you tell people this is the truth this is the doctrine of the message of the hour this is the true word this is the brother you are going out of line of the word this is way this is the way we are taught according to the word stay according to this they don't want to take it from you they want to take some ideas their own ideas and they want to go along with it because why they they're watching how the denomination world they think it's fine they think it's Christian no We stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We stay with the way we are taught. That is why when marriage and divorce came, marriage and divorce doctrine came to us to show us through a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody had had the guts to preach the true marriage and divorce doctrine until a prophet comes on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? Everyone else was willing to compromise. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And keep people in their conditions. &gt;&gt; But a prophet come and say and he even g your people that are living like this now stay like that. But I give grace unto you. Now go and teach your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's given us this word that no matter how we come out, he said now you go and teach your children. So in other words, you come out now. We assembly each assembly go and have sound doctrine in the true word of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't mix the word of God up. Amen. Don't make don't mix the word of God to suit any ideologies or to suit your own whatever things you want to do but stay with the true word of God because the plan and the ultimate purpose is to get people in the rapture and to get people into their blessing for people to come out to be separated from all unbelief and walk into their blessings &gt;&gt; and to walk into the inheritance in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. He say the scripture says don't yoke yourself um among unbelievers. Do not be unequally yolked together. Many places of the scriptures teaches us that we should separate ourselves. The first thing that God required Abraham to do when he called him was to separate himself from his people his kind and then he be blessed and then he bless him. &gt;&gt; Now it doesn't mean you have to leave home. It mean just separate yourself from your worldly associates. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; separates us from the things of the world, from the cares of this world &gt;&gt; and our all affection set on Christ Jesus. Whether we live or die, we serve him and love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And go forward doing all that we can to magnify him unto the people. Now in the day when just at the midnight of Israel's history if you notice king Solomon in the day of Solomon Israel was at its brightest turning then the king of then the then the king of Ahab time of king Ahab it was at his darkest just at the dark time of Israel when Ahab married a little old idol worshipper and brought idolatry into Jewish religion. So did the Holy Ghost church marrying into the world and bringing adultery in the dark ages. Very beautiful type on both churches. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says here, you know, boys, I'm telling you tonight, and you young ladies, be careful who you marry. You'll have a broken home the first thing you know. And he's not good to sinners and Christians to marry to to to He's not good to sinners and Christians to marry together. Don't be unequally yolked together. Cuz that's what got Ahab. She was pretty little thing. Yes, paint all over her face, eyes like a lizard. But the thing of it was that did you know what? That's the truth. Ahab just fell for her because she was perhaps pretty because he couldn't have fell for her character because she was a murderer. She was everything else. That's right. And Aab fell for her because she was pretty. And then he got himself infatuated with her and then she just ruled him with a finger. Did you know the wisest man in the Bible outside of Christ died a heathen idoltor because of a bunch of pretty woman Solomon? Pull him away from God. All right. Don't yoke yourself up unequally. And I've seen many people come to the platform and be healed and walk away and mix up with unbelievers and their sickness come right back to them again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. You saw he also says the Bible say when the unclean spirit's gone out of a man when he walks in dry places seeking rest coming and the first thing you know he goes and gets seven other devils and comes back enters in by force. If the good man of the house isn't standing there to w him out he will come in and be worse than he was in the first place. So if you accept your salvation, put the barriers of the blood of Jesus Christ before the door, they can step in that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So you see what he's calling us to. Amen. You see how dangerous it can be. You can come and have the blessings of God. You can come and be filled with the spirit and then you can walk right out there &gt;&gt; and then you go up and you and associate with the wrong people, with the wrong crowd, with the things of the world. And then what happened? That spirit had left you now. He's gone to get reinforcements and he's coming back to attack you more worse. So that is why you got to fool yourself up with the things of God. &gt;&gt; God is calling us that to a consecrated life in the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is calling us to a total surrender to a total separation from all unbelief &gt;&gt; because he wants to bless us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants us to enjoy the blessing that he's planned for us. He's prepared all this just for us. Amen. He's given us his unmmerited favor. &gt;&gt; He's giving us all this redemptive blessing just for us. But what is stopping us is is to totally separate ourselves from it, from the things of this world. &gt;&gt; Separate yourself from all worldly pleasure. &gt;&gt; Separate yourself from worldly living. Separate yourself from this, from this world, from this flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the biggest enemy. This is what's keeping you down &gt;&gt; because this one is making you think that this is the real person. &gt;&gt; This is not the real you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a temporal body &gt;&gt; that was created by mother and father for the real you &gt;&gt; for the spirit man to dwell in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the one that must have the victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the one that got the overcoming power. That's the one that got to bring this under subjection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this one is keeping you for your blessings. But the real you, Amen, &gt;&gt; he wants to serve God. The real you know that he has to align with God. Amen. The real you is crying about has a thirsting for for more and more of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants to eat more of the word. But this one is blocking you. So you need to bring this one under subjection. How do you do that? You have to you can't live. You'll be a have a you won't have a victorious life having a prayerless life. You won't have a prayer a victorious life out of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to eat. You got to have spiritual food. Amen. You've got to You got to feed that man. Feed that inward man because the one that you feeding more is going to win the battle. &gt;&gt; The one that you feeding more is going to have the victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to separate from your flesh. &gt;&gt; You got to separate from the things from this man. Amen. This this nature that comes to the fall of man, it comes from the fall. That's why we say we wait the redemption of our bodies. We're waiting for that final part. We want this body to be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because as long as that body is not changed, it's going to be a war with your soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is God saying to us? Abraham heard it. &gt;&gt; And he moved out. Amen. &gt;&gt; He started to walk. He started to search for that city. Amen. He started to take he started to be obedient to God's word. And it was counted unto him to righteousness &gt;&gt; because he believed it by faith. He believed what God said him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He believed it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we must embrace God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because right now, there's coming a time where you're not going to enjoy all this time of fellowship together. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's going to come through laws and so forth. &gt;&gt; There's little gatherings that we have in here. &gt;&gt; There's little this time right now. We should be gathering more often and filling oursel with the word of God more often. This shirt supposed to be packed up right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's supposed to be packed up. It It seems that people need a conversion. &gt;&gt; That's what people need when they have a conversion and really can see life the way the spirit man sees it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; People are seeing life through the flesh. People are seeing life through their circumstances. They're seeing life. I wake up in the morning. I got to wake up in the morning. I got to go to work. I got to do this. I got to do that. I got to run errands. That's how they see life. But a spiritful man, a man that has a true conversion, he's looking at real life. Amen. He's looking at life through the eyes of God's word. &gt;&gt; He's looking at fulfilling God's purpose for his life. [Music] So he says here he says yoke yourself up with him. Jesus said for my yoke is light and my burdens are easy. Don't be yolked up with the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Don't be yolked up in different societies and organization. Yoke yourself singly with the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order that you can do it, believe and see the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you know that there is still a good thing, young man, to think to think about young woman?" &gt;&gt; Sorry, I read that. Yeah. Marry someone who is a Christian. Don't marry unbelievers. Yoke yourself not up among unbelievers. Paul said for us not to do that. The scripture is all through for Buddhas for to yoke ourel with unbelievers. But now he's giving you know the balance. Now if you already yoked up with an unbeliever in other words you're already married and he's willing to live with you or she in peace don't leave them. In other words, you both were unbelievers. You got saved and that why now never got saved, but they're willing to live with you as you a Christian. Then don't leave them, but by your lifestyle &gt;&gt; by seeing the change in you &gt;&gt; that can make a difference in their life. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just remain and live a Christian life that you might win your companion to Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see how the prophet Ali gives a balance there. &gt;&gt; Didn't Jesus said if you abide in me and my word in you. Amen. Then ask what you will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you and the word are the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has the preeminences. He's got the rulership. You're a prisoner to him. The world is dead. &gt;&gt; You have nothing more. You see the rest of the people living the way they do, but yet you do not do it. You're a prisoner. y my yoke is easy yoke with Christ with his word I do that only which pleases the father and if you can believe that I am me then believe the word so perfect amen now you know the prophet said that every other church the people are just all hypocrites every people that call themselves Christian they're just hypocrites because they don't believe his word amen &gt;&gt; because if they were true if they really love Jesus they'll believe his word &gt;&gt; but they don't believe his word. They don't love his word. Now this is a late friend. &gt;&gt; You can see what is happening around you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; God don't want us to be yolked up with the things of this world. God God has all these blessings in store for us. He he didn't call us in this message for nothing. He didn't go this entire plan of redemption for nothing. He's already had us in his mind. &gt;&gt; When he's when he's planning this whole plan of redemption, we were all in his thoughts. &gt;&gt; When he's looking at Esther, he's thinking about us. &gt;&gt; When he's looking at Sarah, he's thinking about us. &gt;&gt; When he's looking at perfection in Joseph, he's looking at us. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he's looking at all the Bible characters, he's looking at us. &gt;&gt; So when he called us, he called out to be a blessed people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now the Holy Ghost is positioning us for blessing because there's a final work to do. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Greater works than these ye shall do." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is that hour that he's been positioning us for. &gt;&gt; This is the hour that all the mechanics that we've been eating through the years. This is the hour where the dynamics takes effect on the mechanics. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And now this is the hour when the entire word must be manifested. When you and I walked out of the scripture and become the manifested living word, that what gave Satan a shock &gt;&gt; because Satan thought when this word was being preached and it was just being stored up, he thought how people will believe this things. But through the Holy Ghost, because we had representation, amen, there was a group of people that will receive this word &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now when Satan is looking at people that is coming up in the image of Christ 2,000 years ago, he saw one in the image. He saw one man. He saw the God man on the earth and he remembered what Adam was. Then he saw Jesus there. Then he saw it through the apostles. Then he went to the dark ages. He thought he got them. Then you had a messenger in every age. &gt;&gt; Then there was a man called William Brham in his day splitting in the image of Jesus Christ. so much like Christ that the people mistook him for Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now if it happened then now it's happening in a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is giving Satan convulsions now. &gt;&gt; Satan is going hysterical. &gt;&gt; That's why demons are on a rampage upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Demons are going hysterical &gt;&gt; doing evil things upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Because now sons and daughters of God are being manifested. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan now demon powers, demon spirits that are unleashed on the earth now.
