[5:13] [Music]
[5:14] [Applause]
[5:15] may you be blessed in the house of the
[5:18] Lord to heal at home amen hallelujah
[5:20] amen this morning
[5:22] in return I was attention to the
[5:24] scriptures
[5:28] amen just speak a little thought
[5:31] this amen the spirit
[5:34] is moving in a way and I think it's
[5:35] needful for us to speak on a few things
[5:38] Amen to re-examine our lives we'll speak
[5:40] this morning on the new birth and the
[5:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so let's
[5:45] turn to our scripture reading let's
[5:46] start off
[5:48] and we all know the famous scripture of
[5:50] John chapter 3. and let's start then
[5:53] amen my aim and attention is to capture
[5:55] every one of us and to see where we are
[5:58] in the walk with God
[6:00] let's not assume
[6:02] amen let's not assume things let's look
[6:05] into the word and see how the Holy Ghost
[6:07] was moving
[6:08] and what's the expectation of the Holy
[6:10] Ghost and what he is coming to do and
[6:13] our part what we need to do amen so John
[6:16] chapter 3 says
[6:18] and you know this is a scripture dealing
[6:20] with you must be born again so there was
[6:22] a man of the Pharisee his name Nicodemus
[6:25] a ruler of the Jews the same came to
[6:28] Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi
[6:30] we know that thou art a teacher come
[6:32] from God for no man can do these
[6:34] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[6:37] with him
[6:39] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[6:41] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[6:44] man be born again he cannot see the
[6:47] kingdom of God
[6:49] so there's our first key
[6:53] we must be born again Nicodemus said
[6:56] unto him how can a man be born again
[6:58] when he is old can he enter the second
[7:00] time into his mother's womb and be born
[7:02] Jesus answered verily verily I say unto
[7:06] thee except a man be born of water and
[7:09] of spirit he cannot enter into the
[7:12] kingdom of God
[7:13] pay attention to that verse now because
[7:15] there's two baptisms there amen amen one
[7:18] is the baptism of water
[7:20] and all of us most all of us in this
[7:22] church have gone through baptism of
[7:23] water
[7:25] but there's another baptism that's
[7:27] required and it's of the spirit amen and
[7:30] without that he says he cannot enter
[7:32] into the kingdom of God
[7:35] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[7:38] and that which is born of the spirit is
[7:40] spirit amen Marvel not that I said unto
[7:42] thee you must be born again the wind
[7:45] bloweth Wade listed and thou hear us a
[7:47] sound thereof and cannot tell when to
[7:50] cometh where they go is so is everyone
[7:53] that is born of the spirit amen and then
[7:56] we'll go Amen to our next scripture
[8:00] let's turn to the book of Acts
[8:03] so I said pay attention to the one
[8:04] scripture where our lord Jesus was
[8:06] telling us
[8:08] that we need to be born of water and a
[8:11] spirit but can we be in the church
[8:14] and only have one baptism
[8:17] amen it is possible for us to be in the
[8:20] church
[8:22] and have only experienced the baptism of
[8:24] water like we're going to read in the
[8:26] scripture now it says now when the
[8:28] apostles which were Jerusalem uh that to
[8:31] Mary had received the word of God
[8:33] they sent unto them Peter and John
[8:37] who then when they will come down prayed
[8:40] for them that they might receive the
[8:42] Holy Ghost
[8:43] now watch this next verse it says for us
[8:46] yet he was Fallen upon none of them only
[8:49] they were baptized in the name of the
[8:51] Lord Jesus
[8:56] amen
[8:58] then they laid their hands on them and
[9:01] they received the Holy Ghost
[9:04] amen right
[9:07] now this morning's message will be for
[9:12] us to examine our lives
[9:14] and no one should feel ashamed or
[9:17] condemned if we find ourselves in a
[9:19] position where we say I've only received
[9:21] the water baptism amen amen
[9:25] the spirit wants to help you to be
[9:26] baptized in the Holy Ghost
[9:29] amen amen
[9:32] and let's read Acts chapter 10.
[9:35] because this was an important Revelation
[9:38] that was unlocked to the first church
[9:40] the Jews just thought we became
[9:43] Christians the apostles thought that it
[9:45] was only for the Jews but yet God
[9:47] unlocks a revelation to them and tell
[9:50] them the Holy Ghost is for the Gentiles
[9:51] as well we're going to pick it up from
[9:53] verse 44 where while Peter yet speak
[9:58] amen the Holy Ghost fell on all them
[10:01] which heard the word amen this morning
[10:04] you're going to hear the word of God and
[10:06] if you can receive the holy ghost from
[10:07] Fall while the word of God is being
[10:09] spoken this morning amen Beyond
[10:11] expectation this morning amen amen and
[10:14] they are the circumcision which believed
[10:16] were astonished as many as came with
[10:19] Peter because that on the Gentiles also
[10:22] was poured out the gift of the Holy
[10:24] Ghost
[10:26] if we did it for those Gentiles he can
[10:28] do it for us
[10:31] for they heard them speak with tongues
[10:33] and magnify God now we know those are
[10:35] gifts of the Holy
[10:37] ghosts
[10:40] taking it straight to the water baptism
[10:43] amen that he should not be baptized
[10:47] which have received the Holy Ghost as
[10:48] well as we
[10:50] so it's also possible for you to receive
[10:52] the Holy Ghost and not gone through
[10:54] water baptism
[10:57] and he commanded them to be baptized in
[11:00] the name of the Lord then he prayed they
[11:02] him to tarry certain days one was
[11:04] scripture before you seated and many
[11:07] maybe you're young and you don't know
[11:08] the scripture you're asking how can I be
[11:11] found in the body of Christ First
[11:13] Corinthians 12 and verse 13.
[11:17] very familiar scripture in fact you
[11:19] should buy after amen this is one
[11:21] scripture you should buy heart you'll
[11:23] find the prophet Time and Time and Again
[11:25] recite the scripture
[11:28] he says for one by one spirit
[11:31] are we all baptized into the body
[11:34] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[11:37] we be Bond or free and have we all been
[11:40] made to drink into one spirit amen you
[11:43] may be seated may the Lord and blessings
[11:44] to the reading of his word
[11:47] amen
[11:48] Hallelujah
[11:51] I'd like to start out with a question
[11:53] and we can all examine ourselves and ask
[11:56] ourselves
[11:57] why did we come to church if you had to
[12:00] think quickly ask yourself why did you
[12:02] come to church
[12:05] amen some might say I came to the
[12:07] resurrection
[12:10] some might say I came because my parents
[12:12] brought me they won't let me stay at
[12:14] home
[12:15] [Music]
[12:16] some may say I came to worship God
[12:20] some may say I came to hear the word of
[12:22] God
[12:23] amen I came in obedience to the word
[12:26] that says forsake not be ascending
[12:28] together of ourselves
[12:30] some may say I'm seeking a closer walk
[12:32] with God
[12:34] some may say I need a touch from Jesus I
[12:36] need healing
[12:38] now we may have come for various reasons
[12:42] some may have hidden agendas why they
[12:44] came
[12:45] amen you know the prophecy some come
[12:48] just to find faults
[12:50] and now the idea like a CCTV camera
[12:53] waiting
[12:55] some are like voice recorders waiting
[13:00] amen
[13:01] but everyone that came into the house of
[13:04] God this morning
[13:06] will God receiving exactly what you came
[13:08] for yes
[13:12] you go out receiving what you expected
[13:14] from the service
[13:16] because we get what we expect and if we
[13:19] expect nothing will God having received
[13:22] nothing right so there's one thing for
[13:24] sure that all of us will leave this
[13:26] place either better off
[13:28] or we leave this place worst off will
[13:30] either be filled with his presence with
[13:32] his anointing or we are going to leave
[13:35] this place first off and it says yes for
[13:38] demon
[13:39] foreign
[13:41] [Music]
[13:50] Tabernacle for the devil question and
[13:52] answers
[13:53] amen how many of you want to go to
[13:55] heaven
[13:57] I want to see Hands how many of you want
[13:59] to go to heaven

[14:03] amen
[14:05] Hallelujah we all want to go to heaven
[14:07] isn't it
[14:09] now we can't go to heaven relying on our
[14:12] first birth
[14:15] amen we must be born again amen
[14:19] amen God has provided a way for us to
[14:21] get to heaven but it that way begins on
[14:24] the Earth
[14:25] don't think when you die suddenly God's
[14:27] gonna make all things right and take you
[14:29] to heaven
[14:30] we have choices to make
[14:34] like they say the ball is in your court
[14:37] you try to keep the ball away from the
[14:39] and the Holy Ghost trying to kick it
[14:41] back to you you keep kicking away keep
[14:43] kicking it back in your court
[14:46] right amen and we can either come the
[14:50] hard way or we can come the easy way
[14:52] that's right if you choose to come the
[14:54] hard way you're going to pay great
[14:55] prices on Earth amen you're going to go
[14:58] through trials and situations yes
[15:01] but the Holy Spirit desires surrender
[15:05] amen

[15:11] to get to heaven

[15:15] get to heaven you'll find even something
[15:17] a message saying come to our church and
[15:19] this is happening you'll go to heaven
[15:21] it's
[15:25] by one Spirit we are born into the body
[15:31] as an individual
[15:35] there's no individual rupture for you
[15:38] God's going to empty our breath the
[15:40] sixth Dimension bring that body of
[15:43] Believers to meet with this body of
[15:46] Believers and as one body we are going
[15:49] to be Resurrected
[15:53] so stop walking with your nose in the
[15:55] air I'm thinking you're the only one
[15:57] saved more amen
[16:00] God's not going to Rapture the tall only
[16:03] see how you can call me the tone

[16:31] don't encounter experience and you must
[16:34] be born again now in the Nashville our
[16:37] parents can enroll Us in the best school

[16:46] best subjects
[16:48] they get you the best uniform
[16:50] they want the best teachers for you
[16:53] but after you get the uniform after you

[17:33] so
[17:34] you the teacher can't come in the exam

[17:39] neither can your parents who fought to
[17:41] get you in the school come there and
[17:43] write your exam
[17:45] you must go it through it on your own
[17:48] and what does it take you going to
[17:50] classes you making notes

[17:55] midnight oil you are toiling in the

[18:04] receive a reward of past
[18:06] amen
[18:08] amen so if we want to get to heaven
[18:11] we are going through life's journey now
[18:14] We Are Spiritual Beings
[18:17] having an Earthly encounter stop living
[18:20] like a devil

[18:23] I'm getting tormented by the devil
[18:26] and thinking oh I'm just you're being
[18:29] tormented all the time you are bringing
[18:30] it upon yourself imagine God is the
[18:33] provided way for you and for your life
[18:35] but you keep running away from the
[18:37] presence of God and because you're a son
[18:39] and daughter of God is going to put you
[18:41] into an unpleasant experiences so that
[18:43] you come in line with his word
[18:46] amen hallelujah
[18:49] so we know that the Holy Spirit when it
[18:52] comes amen it starts
[18:54] now every individual every individual
[18:57] here in this church must be born again
[18:59] amen
[19:01] it starts with a new birth and when we
[19:04] have a new birth if we have a new nature
[19:07] amen so the Holy Spirit we know is not a
[19:09] filthy spirit amen
[19:11] amen the Holy Spirit won't an angry in
[19:13] person
[19:14] the atmosphere must be right amen
[19:17] amen so we could have been baptized in
[19:20] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:22] but how we feel through the Holy Spirit
[19:27] I could ask you to raise your hand right
[19:29] now but I don't want to do that
[19:31] how many of you have the Holy Spirit
[19:35] amen but there is an Evidence of the
[19:37] holy spirit amen amen there is fruits of
[19:39] the Holy Spirit
[19:41] if I can talk to somebody for two
[19:44] minutes and I'll tell you if they got
[19:46] the Holy Spirit or not amen
[19:51] amen unfortunately we are not living in
[19:54] the age of sanctification
[19:56] we are not living in the age of
[19:58] justification
[20:00] we are living right in the age of the
[20:02] Holy Ghost
[20:03] [Music]
[20:06] things could not be preached and the
[20:08] ages gone by
[20:09] because it was not time and season amen
[20:12] amen but now at the opening of the world
[20:15] he says when denominational Rivers had
[20:18] the Holy Ghost bound
[20:20] he says but now at the preaching of this
[20:23] message it loose the Holy Ghost
[20:27] so let him that's filthy be filthy still
[20:31] oh yes but let him that's holy be holy
[20:34] still
[20:36] amen now the Holy Ghost is coming upon
[20:39] the person that's already been Justified
[20:41] and Sanctified yes
[20:43] he's not going to come on somebody who's
[20:45] unclean amen amen there are three stages
[20:49] to the spiritual New Birth just as they
[20:52] are stages to the Natural birth
[20:54] amen now you know in the natural birth
[20:56] first there is a conception takes place
[20:59] in the whom of the mother right and then
[21:02] the baby starts to grow in the womb then
[21:04] do you find all the organ stops to form
[21:07] the bone starts to form the skin and
[21:09] everything where is all that's being
[21:11] formed on the inside amen
[21:16] amen amen
[21:17] and when the baby is fully formed
[21:21] after nine months
[21:25] the mother starts to it and is ready to
[21:28] be delivered in the world has to
[21:30] experience
[21:32] nothing more intense sisters forgive me
[21:36] if I'm not saying the right words or
[21:38] using the right terminology
[21:40] I was only a casual Observer
[21:44] when these things were happening
[21:47] right you that have given childbirth you
[21:49] know what I'm talking about
[21:51] Hallelujah so the mother is experiencing
[21:54] birth pains she knows she is ready to
[21:57] deliver the child
[21:59] amen the first thing
[22:01] experience
[22:05] amen any birth is a mess so too is the
[22:08] new birth
[22:09] you cannot say you've had a new birth
[22:11] and you know nothing about it God does
[22:14] not conduct C-sections
[22:16] God does not give you painkillers puts
[22:19] you to sleep and get him and makes you
[22:22] wake up having a new birth and a new
[22:23] nature
[22:25] amen
[22:28] you must bring forth the Christ in your
[22:31] life and it takes both pains you will
[22:34] know when something is happening inside
[22:36] of you amen amen
[22:39] what do we spend our times doing what do
[22:41] we spend our time doing what music do we
[22:44] listen to Young People old people
[22:47] what music do we listen to pop music
[22:49] ungodly music amen what kind of
[22:52] atmosphere we're creating we want to be

[25:58] move
[26:00] oh then he says let me come into your

[26:18] you are comfortable around that kind of
[26:20] conversation then I ask you to
[26:23] re-examine your spirit
[26:25] because the spirit Is possessing you is
[26:28] not the holy spirit amen
[26:32] amen
[26:39] some of us the only tongues we speak
[26:42] is in a filthy town
[26:47] you know Jesus was at the confidence to
[26:50] ask this question
[26:51] whom do men say that I the son of man am
[26:54] en we are free to ask them
[27:00] if we are to ask a question who do men
[27:02] say that I am
[27:05] [Music]
[27:07] he walked around the road scraping his

[27:15] who's that person
[27:17] who do men say I am yeah I don't know
[27:19] that that man always shouting at his
[27:21] wife eh he's always singing at the
[27:23] children and eating them
[27:27] who do men say that I the son of man am
[27:30] what's my testimony amongst the people
[27:34] what's your testimony amongst the world
[27:36] friend do they even know you're a
[27:37] Christian
[27:39] no something there
[27:42] 007
[27:44] on a secret mission
[27:47] in the kingdom of God covert operation
[27:51] what we call them brother Joshua playing
[27:53] clothes officers roaming the streets
[28:00] nobody must know you're a Christian
[28:06] amen
[28:09] some people leave the house in a dress
[28:12] and go change
[28:15] before they go to work
[28:18] the bag is packed with the makeup they
[28:22] can put it on on their way to work they
[28:24] wash their face before they come home
[28:26] but some are so bad they don't even care
[28:30] right
[28:31] amen we've got to move along hey man I'm
[28:34] just trying to show you some things amen
[28:36] that we've got to examine Our Lives amen
[28:39] because we can't hit ourselves the Lord
[28:42] can take our breath right now where will
[28:44] we end up amen now we can't base our
[28:47] experience with the new birth and the
[28:49] Holy Ghost based on family
[28:52] you cannot go in on your father's
[28:54] experience mother's experience
[28:56] individual experience young man younger
[29:00] you must be born again
[29:04] amen
[29:08] so we know that after the shedding of
[29:09] blood the mother is now pushing out
[29:11] their baby
[29:13] and when the baby comes out he takes his
[29:16] first breath
[29:18] and with that first breath the spirit
[29:20] enters the body
[29:23] and comes to life
[29:25] now we don't want stillborn Birds
[29:27] right no stillborn birds in the kingdom
[29:30] of God now the day you were born is
[29:32] known as your birthday
[29:35] and each one of us has a birthday
[29:41] every one of us have a birthday none of
[29:43] us are angels have been dropped down
[29:45] from heaven yeah
[29:47] we love our birthdays we think highly of
[29:50] this important day
[29:53] amen we think highly of this day
[29:57] we think highly of ourselves and so
[29:58] important that we want everyone to wish
[30:00] us we want people to spoil us
[30:04] and we want to be treated well on our
[30:07] birthday
[30:08] this is my day
[30:10] amen
[30:12] but we should Rejoice even more at the
[30:14] new birth
[30:17] amen because the natural birth can only
[30:20] inherit Earthly things but the spiritual
[30:24] blood Jesus said except a man be born
[30:26] again he cannot enter the kingdom
[30:28] inherit the kingdom of God the new birth
[30:31] will make you inherit the kingdom of God
[30:33] Amen
[30:34] [Music]
[30:36] amen
[30:37] Hallelujah now this is a very marvelous
[30:40] thing and I want to bring it very
[30:42] quickly I don't have time to go and
[30:43] teach it right now but you know that the
[30:46] new birth consists of three stages
[30:48] justification sanctification and baptism
[30:52] of the Holy Ghost
[30:54] right I'm gonna jump ahead these three
[30:57] stages where events we can probably
[31:00] throw up those notes then you'll find
[31:01] some of it there amen
[31:05] [Music]
[31:10] because it was signified by Three Angels
[31:13] message
[31:14] you know the Three Angels flying
[31:17] in the Book of Revelation The Three
[31:19] Angels message
[31:21] each stage because the church had come
[31:23] through seven Church ages and the
[31:25] restoration were just
[31:29] amen
[31:31] amen
[31:35] amen you find the prophet of God
[31:37] laboring to bring the things out
[31:39] but it was also signified on the Earth
[31:41] by other three things three distinct
[31:44] things that are called will
[31:47] remember
[31:52] the email you find this in the Book of
[31:54] Revelation chapter 7 where he says hold
[31:56] back the winds amen so what is this
[31:58] three words signify the prophet says it
[32:01] signifies the birth Prince and the Earth
[32:03] he's going through amen
[32:07] amen he says here
[32:09] [Music]
[32:10] the first if in the first book
[32:13] sorry the first world war they had
[32:17] certain type of weaponry
[32:22] everyone following now
[32:24] so think of it as three stages now
[32:26] justification sanctification baptism of
[32:29] the Holy Ghost
[32:31] right Three Angels messages but three
[32:33] Wars also signifying the three birth
[32:35] pains that the Earth is going through he
[32:38] says under the first birth pain
[32:41] we had bombs machine guns and poison gas
[32:44] mustard and chlorine gas that would burn
[32:47] up the world and these winds were
[32:49] blowing on the Earth
[32:51] and everyone was scared to death under
[32:53] this great weapon
[32:54] now I'm trying to hopefully you can see
[32:57] what I'm trying to present to you
[33:00] in the spirit world
[33:02] because in the natural if they produce
[33:05] Weaponry that was able to annihilate the
[33:08] kingdom of the Earth
[33:10] in the spiritual
[33:12] under justification there were weapons
[33:14] released to the church that will
[33:16] annihilate Satan's kingdom amen
[33:21] amen
[33:22] and each pain produce greater weaponry
[33:27] amen so true that each stage of the Holy
[33:29] Ghost gives the church a greater power
[33:31] and an action
[33:34] amen
[33:35] each stage
[33:38] the church in the greatest amen this
[33:41] church is not empowered the same way
[33:43] that Wesley was
[33:45] but this church has received the
[33:47] fullness of the power amen amen to
[33:50] overcome and withstand
[33:53] it's tactics
[33:56] the Holy Ghost has come to wanted to
[33:58] bring that and we could have labored on
[33:59] that point but I want you to understand
[34:01] each blood pain produce greater Weaponry
[34:04] second world war produce the atomic bomb
[34:07] a greater weapon
[34:10] amen he says could have been finished in
[34:12] the second world war but they were
[34:14] Angels holding back the winds yes
[34:17] but now they is coming forth one more
[34:19] bird pain
[34:21] lightning is coming forth one more pain
[34:24] in this bride amen then we're gonna push
[34:27] out amen hallelujah
[34:31] yes
[34:33] thank you let's go to those notes amen
[34:36] let's go up there first one
[34:39] he says here I want you to see this now
[34:41] because some they don't believe in
[34:43] certain things
[34:46] yes the Holy Ghost now
[34:49] the Holy Ghost Shield may say can I
[34:51] receive the Holy Ghost here's what the
[34:53] prophet is saying he's ready to fill any
[34:55] heart that's empty of the world Amen the
[34:59] reason why the Holy Spirit may not be
[35:02] able to fill you is because we are so
[35:04] full of ourselves
[35:06] we are so full of our own ideas
[35:09] right now say holy spirit I Surrender I
[35:12] don't want you to wait till you're home
[35:13] now right now say holy spirit I
[35:15] surrender all my thoughts all my plans I
[35:18] empty out Lord
[35:19] I don't want to leave this for tomorrow
[35:22] amen do it now
[35:25] it's ready to fill in any heart that's
[35:27] empty out the world oh nonsense say I
[35:31] cement it now whatever it be lying
[35:34] cheating gambling stealing amen whatever
[35:36] your problem is leave now amen empty out
[35:40] he says Christ for coming in the form of
[35:42] the Holy Ghost and you'll be saved and
[35:45] have peace and if you want that amen
[35:48] let's go on he says the Holy Ghost
[35:50] priesthood of circumcision of the heart
[35:54] so here he's talking about the
[35:55] circumcision sign that was given to
[35:58] Abraham but he's saying the holy ghost
[36:00] is now in the priesthood of circumcision
[36:03] of the hearts and not the flesh what is
[36:06] circumcision taking away the excess
[36:08] flesh it is signed to the believer
[36:11] the Holy Ghost is here to perform to
[36:13] take away the excess flesh
[36:16] then you can offer praise
[36:18] to God
[36:21] sacrifice your limb you never sing you
[36:24] never worship
[36:27] because they
[36:30] amen
[36:32] the Bible says let everything that has
[36:34] breath praise the Lord amen don't live
[36:37] and steal
[36:39] we praise
[36:41] let everything that I need the Lord
[36:46] amen each one fasting fighting stewing
[36:51] this death right that's not how the Holy
[36:53] Ghost works it says when they were in
[36:56] one man
[36:58] yes
[37:01] you'll never be
[37:04] sings lightly even in the church you'll
[37:07] never be saved and receive the Holy
[37:09] Ghost unless you believe the word of God
[37:11] and the man that's preaching it
[37:14] not who you think he is
[37:18] right
[37:19] right the properties you respect the
[37:20] office of demand amen
[37:24] and there's nothing wrong if you respect
[37:25] the man as well some people are so
[37:28] arrogant in the message oh he's lucky
[37:30] he's a pastor I'll respect him
[37:33] but what's wrong what's wrong why are
[37:35] you so upset
[37:36] [Music]
[37:39] about things
[37:41] which
[37:43] are fighting we're against flesh and
[37:47] blood
[37:50] never be saved am I you'll never be
[37:53] saved keep the Holy Ghost unless the
[37:56] word of God and the man that's the gift
[37:58] of healing
[38:00] if you get the people to believe you
[38:03] isn't that what the angel told the
[38:04] prophet nothing important because people
[38:06] don't like to do this
[38:08] sometimes I like to do practical things
[38:11] he says right after the healing service
[38:12] I want each of you that raise your hand
[38:14] to come to the altar personally kneel
[38:17] down and pray
[38:18] because the prophet of the age telling
[38:20] you to do something amen yes he said no
[38:23] now
[38:24] this is my religious voice we don't know
[38:26] now we have the opening of the world
[38:31] people must just receive it they in the
[38:33] morning
[38:35] but not everyone is enjoyable brother
[38:39] the person preaching that never ever
[38:40] receives
[38:42] let me tell you that
[38:44] when he's sitting there you don't have a
[38:46] receipt he only preaches it
[38:49] but it doesn't experience it why doesn't
[38:51] he receive it the way he's saying he was
[38:53] receiving
[38:56] yes the prophet he says come to the
[38:59] Altar and kneel down and pray raising
[39:00] your hand does that do anything yes sir
[39:02] amen certainly he does yeah
[39:05] sometimes all we need in the house of
[39:07] the Lord is some good old-fashioned
[39:09] repentance
[39:11] cause I'm crying out to the Lord
[39:13] I am weighed in the balances and I have
[39:16] far wanting
[39:20] he that Hearth my words and believeth on
[39:23] him that sent me had everlasting life
[39:25] amen
[39:26] makes you a new creature then your
[39:29] fruits will prove it amen
[39:36] after you've done that after you've done
[39:38] what come to the alt and repent
[39:42] you know I said that some people are
[39:43] secret covert agents
[39:46] some people also see
[39:54] forgive me we started out by saying that
[39:56] some people were baptized in the name of
[39:58] the Lord Jesus Christ you remember but
[40:01] they didn't receive the baptism of the
[40:03] Holy Ghost
[40:05] what is baptism in the name of the Lord
[40:07] Jesus Christ what do we always say at
[40:09] baptism it's an outward show
[40:12] that an inward walk has been done
[40:14] [Music]
[40:16] it's a public declaration
[40:20] in the house of the Lord
[40:22] there should be no one feeling ashamed
[40:24] in fact if somebody is looking down on
[40:26] your ashamed you bring them with they
[40:29] need to repent pray with you amen
[40:31] hallelujah
[40:33] thank you amen
[40:36] hmm
[40:38] it says by one spirit will be baptized
[40:40] into the body of power and service amen
[40:43] amen he never said you'll receive the
[40:45] new birth after the Holy Ghost come upon
[40:47] you you see what some people are looking
[40:49] for
[40:53] some people are looking for the new
[40:55] birth
[40:56] after the Holy Ghost comes you can't
[40:58] have it that way
[41:00] you've got to have a new birth first
[41:04] then the Holy Ghost
[41:07] said you
[41:09] know after the whole
[41:11] upon you
[41:15] but you baptized with the Holy Ghost
[41:17] until power powerful service
[41:19] amen
[41:21] Hallelujah
[41:25] amen let's turn to Luke chapter 1 verse
[41:28] 35 I just want to lay some scriptures
[41:29] here very quickly
[41:32] while you're turning to that scripture
[41:33] there
[41:37] and it's not Acts chapter two like some
[41:39] of your thinking
[41:42] I think I've preached enough now
[41:45] I want to lay some scriptures
[41:47] so that you
[41:49] look 135 says the angel answered and
[41:52] said unto her
[41:53] come upon thee
[41:55] first time the Holy Ghost
[42:01] then there's a promise given in Matthew
[42:02] 3 and 11.
[42:04] where they asked the Apostle John
[42:08] the Baptist and he's telling them I
[42:11] indeed baptize he shall baptize you with
[42:14] the Holy Ghost
[42:17] amen Jesus is coming to baptize you with
[42:21] the Holy Ghost
[42:25] amen and with fire
[42:28] yes amen
[42:30] Matthew 12 and 31.
[42:38] this is what happens when people don't
[42:40] reverence the Holy Spirit now he says
[42:42] all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
[42:44] forgiven unto men but the blasphemy
[42:47] against the Holy Ghost shall not be
[42:50] forgiven unto men verse 32 whosoever
[42:53] speaking the word against the son of man
[42:54] it shall be forgiven him but whosoever
[42:57] speak it against the Holy Ghost it shall
[42:59] not be forgiven him
[43:01] neither in this world neither in the
[43:03] world to come right you understand the
[43:06] severity of them
[43:08] you can speak Jesus we ghost
[43:12] and let me bring this more clearly how
[43:15] is the Holy Ghost appearing
[43:23] the whole
[43:26] amen
[43:28] okay
[43:30] we need to move quickly now amen to get
[43:32] to a few more scriptures
[43:35] yes the Apostle the John the Baptist 9
[43:38] Luke 1 15.
[43:41] so Acts chapter 2 is not when the Holy
[43:43] Ghost first fell
[43:46] that's when it first fell after Jesus
[43:48] left but yet Luke one until it says
[43:50] talking about God he shall be in the
[43:52] sight of the Lord give me the wine and
[43:56] he shows
[43:57] but notice the Holy Ghost we sing in the
[44:00] mothers who we can actually identify the
[44:02] time period there to find in Luke 1 41
[44:05] when he actually received the Holy Ghost
[44:07] it says it came to pass when Elizabeth
[44:09] heard the salutation of Mary The Babe
[44:12] left you to whom and Elizabeth was
[44:14] filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[44:16] So Not only was John Field
[44:18] Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost
[44:20] Not only was Elizabeth filled but you'll
[44:23] read in Luke 167 and his father
[44:26] Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost
[44:30] and one that only goes to prophesy
[44:34] amen then you go to Luke 2 and 25 you'll
[44:37] see here is a man by the name of Simeon
[44:42] and the Bible says he's a man that was
[44:44] just and devout waiting for the
[44:45] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[44:48] was upon him
[44:51] and the Holy Ghost is a teacher now is
[44:54] revealing it revealed unto him by the
[44:56] holy ghost that he should not see death
[44:58] before he had seen the Lord's Christ
[45:03] amen Everybody follow him
[45:06] amen
[45:08] then in Luke chapter 3 and verse 22
[45:14] the Holy Ghost now is descending Upon
[45:17] Jesus and it says
[45:19] and behold
[45:22] and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily
[45:25] shape like a dove upon him and a voice
[45:28] Came From Heaven which said thou what my
[45:30] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[45:35] and Jesus sorry Luke 4 1.
[45:39] it says and Jesus being full of the Holy
[45:43] Ghost returned from Jordan and was led
[45:46] by the spirit Into the Wilderness
[45:51] so the spirit will lead you to your
[45:53] quiet times
[45:54] the spirit will lead you why was he
[45:56] going there he was going to fast the
[45:58] spirit will lead you to fast
[46:00] the spirit will lead you to pray
[46:05] amen
[46:11] John 7 and 37
[46:14] yeah Lord Jesus now he's talking about
[46:16] the Holy Ghost baptism that will come
[46:18] upon us
[46:20] it says in the last day are we living in
[46:22] the last day
[46:24] amen
[46:25] the Great Day of Defeat Jesus stood and
[46:28] cried If any man thirst
[46:30] let him come unto me and drink
[46:33] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[46:35] says out of his belly shall flow rivers
[46:38] of Living Waters amen but this speakey
[46:42] of the spirit
[46:43] which they
[46:45] believe on him should receive for the
[46:47] Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[46:49] Jesus was not yet glorified amen so what
[46:53] are we finding here
[46:54] Jesus was dealing with individuals that
[46:57] was going to bring the promise to pass
[46:58] he was dealing with Mary Elizabeth John
[47:02] Zacharias because and Simeon because
[47:04] they were instrumental
[47:06] in bringing the promise to pass
[47:11] John 14 and 25
[47:15] says
[47:16] these things I have spoken unto you
[47:18] being yet present with you
[47:20] but the comforter
[47:22] here's the Holy Ghost now he's a
[47:24] comforter
[47:25] which is the Holy Ghost whom the father
[47:27] will send in my name
[47:29] yeah
[47:30] what is the name of the Holy Ghost
[47:33] Jesus amen
[47:36] the father shall send in my name
[47:39] what is the name of the Holy Ghost
[47:44] some don't believe that
[47:46] some say these two Jesus I'm showing you
[47:49] this three Jesus in in their terminology
[47:52] there's only one Lord Jesus Christ
[47:55] in their reasoning
[47:57] Jesus said I came in my father's name
[48:00] so his name was Jesus so the father's
[48:02] name is Jesus there's a father Jesus
[48:04] there's a son Jesus now we've got a
[48:06] problem here because Jesus is saying I'm
[48:08] going to send the comforter the Holy
[48:10] Ghost and I'm going to send him in my
[48:12] name amen the Holy Ghost is going to be
[48:15] named Jesus so now they've got three
[48:17] Jesus
[48:18] but the Revelation is in this hour the
[48:21] father
[48:22] Son and Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus
[48:26] Christ amen
[48:30] [Music]
[48:32] what is he gonna do he shall teach you
[48:35] all things
[48:39] he shall bring things to your
[48:41] remembrance
[48:43] now very important
[48:45] is this next line
[48:47] whatsoever I have said unto you
[48:50] so if you don't know what Jesus said
[48:53] how can he bring things to your
[48:55] remembrance
[48:57] if you don't read the word
[48:59] how can he bring those things to your
[49:01] remembrance
[49:03] if you don't spend time
[49:06] how can you bring those things and teach
[49:08] you
[49:15] amen
[49:19] let's drop to verse 15 the same chapter
[49:23] amen
[49:26] he says here if you love me
[49:29] keep my Commandments
[49:31] and I will pray the father he shall give
[49:33] you another comforter that he may abide
[49:36] with you forever
[49:38] now here's another thing he is the
[49:40] spirit of Truth
[49:42] right
[49:46] it says the world can't receive him it's
[49:48] yet him not neither nor with him but you
[49:51] know him for he dwelleth with you
[49:55] you know
[49:56] and shall be in you amen amen
[50:00] hallelujah
[50:02] the Holy Spirit dwells with you
[50:06] and he dwells in you
[50:11] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[50:14] come to you yet a little while in the
[50:16] world see at me no more but you shall
[50:18] see me because I live you shall live
[50:20] also amen at that day you shall know
[50:22] that I am in the father and you in me
[50:24] and I knew
[50:25] he that had my Commandments and keepeth
[50:28] them is he that loveth me
[50:31] who are the ones that love him that keep
[50:34] his Commandments
[50:36] and he that loveth me shall also be
[50:39] loved of my father and I will love him
[50:42] and will manifest myself to him
[50:49] Judas now asks a question how will you
[50:51] manifest yourself he says if a man loves
[50:54] me he will keep my words
[50:58] and my father will love him and we will
[51:01] come unto him and make our board with
[51:06] him
[51:09] some of us are feeling very
[51:10] uncomfortable right now
[51:13] important to us
[51:16] not one to accept and this is where
[51:18] we're gonna kill the flesh now
[51:20] we do not want to accept that we are the
[51:22] Temple of the Holy Ghost
[51:27] people that was given to us
[51:29] is for the indwelling presence of the
[51:31] Holy Ghost
[51:40] which is the Holy Ghost whom the father
[51:44] will send in my name he shall teach you
[51:47] all things and bring all things to your
[51:49] remembrance whatsoever things I have
[51:52] said unto you
[51:54] amen
[51:57] Luke 11 and 13. you're saying how can I
[52:00] receive the Holy Ghost

[52:05] if you then being evil know how to give
