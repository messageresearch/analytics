Egypt this night and will Smite all the first born in the land of Egypt both men and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token the blood shall be to you for what for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I'll pass over you not when I see long dresses not when I see long when I see the Hallelujah not when I see people who say shalom shalom no when I see the pl I'll pass over you Hallelujah when I see the pl I will pass over you and the BL shall shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt we may be seated may God His blessings to the reading of the word so we just want to talk about the token how many can say Amen the singer says Let the dead Angel pass God spr himself at last how many believe that this is token applying time how many believe that this is the season for the token are we together friends hey God bless you church so we are talking about the toen amen so I just want you to see something here hallelujah amen so let's I just want to start with a quotation I just want to start with a quotation from our Prophet Hallelujah when I see the blood I will pass over you amen do you love him are you under expectation listen to this in the message message the toen 6391 he says the was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 40 days and then the lamp was killed and the blood was applied in the evening time you get it the token never come into existence until the evening time so this is one important aspect the token was not applied in the morning it was not applied in the afternoon but the token was applied in the evening time and you and me we are living in the evening time this is the season of the token how many can say Amen oh and listen I want you to see friends huh that token H what is it it is a sign that you have met God's requirement are we together the token is like a Bo pass it's like a ticket brother says you know the railway companies the bus companies you pay a ticket so listen the bus companies they don't want to see the ticket but what they want is the money but the ticket is a sign that the money is been PA listen to this how many can say Amen the Ethiopian Airlines South African airlines British airlines what they want is money but what proves that you have paid the money is the Bo pass are we together they want is the money but when you come to Bo you don't come with the money during boting time they don't need your money they want to see the token the pass even if you come without a suit as long as you have got a Bo pass even if you don't have money even if you are poor are we together the airlines they want the Bing pass so the token is a sign that God's requirement has been made listen what God really wanted in Egypt it was not the blood it was the land every household was supposed to kill the lamb but the blood was the sign that the lamb died how many can say Amen do you believe it what was needed was the L every household was supposed to what to kill a l if it was a small family they Unite with another family Hallelujah to eat that but the requirement of God was the it to die but the blood which was the toen was a sign was the evate but God's requirement was made can you say Amen do you hear what I'm saying hallelujah amen praise be to God and I want to say this also the spies in Jero are we together they did not bring the token no the token was with love she hat the toen I want to tell you friends I did not bring the token from Z you have the token the token is here in ja you must pull out your token Hallelujah do you understand what I'm saying how many can say Amen the spice did not bring the token the token was with I did not bring the token here you have the token you have to apply the [Applause] toen are we together friends huh amen God bless you church so just I'm just giving a small title I'm saying you know the toen is the highest version of the new B how many say Amen the token is the highest verion of the new B and I want to say this the initial stage of the Holy Ghost is the new be I preach the message sometime from be to adoption understand what I'm saying there is one Pastor there is only one Holy Ghost there is no two Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost it grows how many the Holy Ghost grows from adoption from bir to adoption listen it's not three stages says justification in the message of the Masterpiece can I go quickly 6405 0705 paragraph 136 notice here the life that was in the H in the sto in the tel in the H alls in the seed and the life that was in the sto went one one went to another to make the other Isen justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptis of the Holy Ghost many times we end here the baptism of the Holy Ghost but go on it says the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself there is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost itself that's why the prophet says the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the very works that he did when he was he there is a mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation so the prophet is showing us four stages here justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost itself what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost itself that token the adoption the token listen the token is the highest level of this holy ghost that we are talking about there is only one Holy Ghost but when we talk about the token is the last stage it's you know it's Visions just like Sams one you know it's a Sam but what is the latest here s 2 is 24 so now the new is and the token is Sams 24 the same Holy Ghost how many can say Amen how many can say Amen there is Toyota Fortuna for 2005 and there is Toyota Fortuna for 2024 they are all fortuners but different levels so when we talk about the token we are talking about a higher level how many say how many believe are you with me why did the Rapture take place during the days of Paul when Paul was preaching he was preaching as if the rapt will happen in his day Paul said we which are alive and remain will be CAU up together do you know why the Rapture not happen because the level of the Holy Ghost the fion of the Holy Ghost of the days of was not enough to Tri a resurrection how without us cannot be made perfect how say Amen it's going what higher the same Holy Ghost how many say Do you believe it in our age can I say this do you know that the level of holy ghost that you and me receive is different from the level which they received in Hallelujah yes I'm telling you I'm talking about the token is the high name the token is the highest vision in 24 do you believe it listen if you see brother Bram speaking about the token he spoke highly about the token you know at first when I was studying I thought that Holy Ghost and the new and the token is the same thing but I saw that no no no no no the token is higher says you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and still go to hell and be lost but you can't receive the token and go to hell the token is the sing Hallelujah when we talk about the token we are talking about the sing you are filled until the destination when you receive now the token you can say Let the dead Angel pass Hallelujah can you say hallelujah hallah can you say praise the Lord can you say thank you Jesus thank you I feel the token is here hallelujah I don't feel some resentment here how many can say Amen you people you love the Lord how many say Amen we are preaching for message of the hour while we are preaching this de you receive your healing you receive your car you receive the Holy Ghost you receive demons are running away and end time message will meet the end time condition when the enemy comes in the FL the spirit of almighty God will raise the standard how many say do you believe it the devil is in trouble tonight say Amen the devil is finished the toen is here you are healed you are free do you believe it the toen is [Applause] here can you say Amen justification meant a way for sanctification sanctification Made A Way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself I know in part I prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be turn away how many e are here let's come up higher above inflation above sickness above H let's come up higher tonight is your night today is your day this is the day of your visitation how many say you believe it you are already free you are already healed it was finished at Cal when he said it is finished your sickness was finished your PP was finished [Applause] how toen is here H we are God do you believe it let theel pass God's is safe at [Applause] last you are going to see the prophet says here in the message that talking yeah paragraph 274 he only recognizes the talking that's the message of the hour that's the message of this day that's the message of this time in the name of Jesus Christ receive it that's what I'm reading I'm reading the token message 6391 paragraph 274 he only recognizes the talking that's the message of the hour that's the message of this day that's the message of this time and then the prophet says in the name of Jesus Christ receive it hallelujah it's not about long hair it's not about long dresses it's not about not watching television can you imagine when the angel was coming he wanted to see the blood on the door post and on the details there are some people who believe in legalism they think legalism will save them listen to this even if you had a long long dress and you did not put the token the angel was going to kill you the angel wanted the BL the toen when I see the BL I pass how say I don't believe in disgrace too much grace past name will be disgrace how many can say Amen to love him H what is the token that's the message of the hour that's the message of this day that's the message of this time in the name of Jesus Christ receive it do you love him huh let's continue God bless BL you Church Hallelujah he says the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days and then the lamb was killed and the blood applied in the evening that's why it's always saying it shall be light in the evening time because the token is applied in this evening time do you see what I'm saying look W Pentecost they did not leave enough to see what you see to hear what you he do you hear what I'm saying God bless you amen hallelujah can you say amen amen it's hot here like I say don't worry we will be finished amen amen glory praise God I fear corruption so the service will be short again for the sake of the elect hallelujah how be [Applause] blessed that token is the highest version of the new B the token is higher than the new B hallelujah how many can say Amen am listen I wish I had that book the St of a perfect man if the brothers maybe they can project it but if you see those the St of a perfect man you will see down there in the foundation there is Faith and then on top there there is a love that a triangle there there is love and in between above bre kindness there is the holy spirit there did you see that and listen that Holy Spirit which is above bre and kindness is not the new B that Holy Spirit there is the token is the adoption listen listen you start with a new P because what is listen what is justification how many can say Amen when we start the basement are we together you must be born again so it means you start with a new B so in the basement of the state of a perfect man there is the new bed which is the initial stage of the Holy Ghost and then you start climbing to your fa virtue to Virtue knowledge to knowledge patience to patience understand then after kindness you see now the Holy Ghost which is above the virtues the Holy Ghost which is above bre and kindness that's not talking that's not the new P the new p is down how many say [Applause] amen that's why I'm saying that talken is above the new that's why preached a message where I think [Applause] failed where I think pente failed says the P they received the new p and they put a full stop said that s says that was an error they were only begotten after you are born again Hallelujah there is more to come there is a blessing of s there is adoption you understand when you receive the new B you are not adopted says your B is not your adoption but your adoption is your blessing how many say Do you believe it hallelujah oh I feel religious I feel them preaching tonight can you say hallelujah hallelujah tell your neighbor and say your bed is not your adoption your B is not your adoption when you receive the new B you are not adopted that's the [Music] beginning that's where the P made a mistake when they received the new P they thought that s I'm okay now no huh you need to go until you receive that token until you are adopted how many are with me is it wonderful you sisters HH you give bab sister the first day you see the child saying hello mama will you not run away the first day you see your child walking yes do you see now so I'm saying that new you are still a baby you need to be given over to the tutors adoption is determined by your behavior do you hear what I'm saying so a lot a lot of us have received the new bed but we still need to move on until we receive the adoption Jesus received the new B By The River Jordan are we together and then after he received what what happened he was taken to the wilderness for childing are we together and when he passed the test the came change these stones and make them you said it's came make yourself form that the angels will give charge the Bible says it is written th shall not take God after Jesus passed to the test Jesus Took God took him now to the mountain of transfig and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased to dwell in he you must Reach This level where God can say he a child as long as he is a servant different

they would come and help us and help our elders you know South Africa means more to us name they our elders I really appreciate God's generals I'm telling you I Pastor all these other pastors they used to come to Zimbabwe when we were still in our infancy now we are standing now we also preaching you know it's wonderful to appreciate you know some people don't appreciate we appreciate what the El from South Africa did in Zimbabwe you people you received the message before us I really appreciate that so I did not come to teach people no I just came here to my bridge I just came here are we together to BR my angle of the Gospel you remember MTH Mark L and John they saw the same thing they saw the crucifixion but the way Matthew wrote it was different from what John wrote it John was writing it with an anointing was The Gospel according to John theel Toth the gopel ACC to what toew to Mark so it's just the Gospel According to Pastor Moses I'm not the best I I'm just different to be different is not to be against if I try to be Pastor M I defeat the purpose why I was called I just have to be myself how many say am what you [Music] are am listen friend this is a rich subject I want you to see what brother says here hallelujah amen praise God he's talking about I I'm saying that to is the highest version of the new bir is that right are you understanding are we together friends let me just see how I I just wind up because there's a lot of things to say but let me just hit the high points and we close God bless you church so he say here and this is the evening time of the age that we live in this is the evening time for the church this is the evening time for me this is the evening time of my message I'm dying I'm going I'm moving out in the in the evening time of the gospel and we have come up through justification and so forth but this is the time that the token has to be applied this is the time where the token has to be applied I told you last Sunday I have something I want to talk to you about this is it so brother he really valued the message of the token this time when you just can't play it it's going to be done it's ever going to be done it's going to be done now because we can see that the road is about ready to pass through the land and everything from under that token will perish am everything from under that token will perish the blood has identified you I want you to see this how brother BR you know valued the token let me read quickly the token is the highest version of this new of this holy ghost that we are talking about huh do you love him just want to go quickly I just want you to see that the Holy Ghost it grows from birth to adoption listen I just want you to see the message Divine Healing 541 1219 brother says on paragraph 165 we grow daily each day our heart hungers keeps moving on there is something growing inside of you and you get bigger spread out can take more Paul told to the Corinthian Church you are matur growing he says when you want to be teachers you are still [Music] teaching me and then says is that right when you ought to be teachers listen now brother says something in there growing out pushing out making bigger then he says the Holy Spirit glowing the Holy Ghost glowing from B to ad from justification to listen do you know that justification received the Holy Ghost because justification is a portion of the Holy Ghost sanctification Andy the same Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost restoration of gifts and otive high listen to this new B if a B is is born from inside from the inside out the child it grows if it lives if it doesn't it remains is that right when a bed is on the inside should it grow says Christ in your heart ought to be growing T getting bigger more powerful understanding me biger forgiving walking on as God would till Christ is formed in you the hope of [Applause] glory growing from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost adoption can I show you that the holy ghost that we receive today yes is higher amen the level of the Holy Ghost that they receive in a street and at Pentecost the signs of his coming 62407 listen are you with me paragraph 118 some pcal people today count Luther and you see don't count Martin Luther in them why because they say Martin Luther he didn't have the Holy Ghost brother says he did Hallelujah I'm reading he what he did so the initial level of the Holy Ghost justification it was the second level of the Holy Ghost then sanctification and otif fire then the new B the restoration of gift then after that the adoption are we together am so listen he did says he did he might not he might not it in the depth that we get it now says received the Holy Ghost but he did not get it in the dep that you and me receive it now the death of the Holy Ghost to death is the talken is the adoption that's why the Rapture will happen in our day where the full Holy Ghost has come says the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have received in a measure that the power the full power of the Holy Ghost will come and the death in Christ will rise H so the rapture will happen in our day because the level of the Holy Ghost in our day is enough to trigger the [Applause] resurrection if you want Pastor kengan to rise if you want Pastor Paul M to rise we have to go higher and preach the level of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah where they can be taken out where they are do what I'm saying he without us cannot be made perfect I Reon why the Rapture did not happen in the days of God the Holy Ghost was still in a measure but in this season is the Holy Ghost without measure hallelujah how many can say Amen do you believe it in our day it's the kosis empty himself hallah all what was in God was brought into Christ all that was in Christ was pour into the church container and content Hallelujah it was above us in the days of Moses in the days of Jesus Emmanuel it was

I'm Clos please I'm closing Hallelujah bless youen God bless you too [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen I said the token is the highest Vision yes sir it's it's the highest and you know brother speaks about circumcision and he says circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost cutting off excess flesh so I want you to see where brother isting that circumcision and that to I want you to see that in the message that toen preached in 1964 maybe I'll read this then as we continue we will be explaining this but listen paragraph 49 now if you haven't got that token you will not come you will not be coming in yes you must you must have the toen that's the required price when I see the blood the blood is the token when I see the blood I'll pass over you listen you must have the token if you don't why you won't go you you youve got to have the token listen if the token was not displayed the token wasn't sh down there when the Covenant listen he says even the Covenant wasn't in effect that's serious now what's the Covenant it's circumcision because the Jews were given the Covenant of circumcision Jews were supposed to be circumcised in the E day so brother says if a Believer even if he was circumcised and denied and refuse to apply the token that Covenant yes of the circumcision was NFI it was not of effect do you now understand why it says you can receive the Holy Ghost every hour and still go to H do you now understand why John was crying how many believe that re the holy ghost in the but when there was a proclamation who is worthy to take the book and open the seals John was crying yes so if you think the Holy Ghost the new is enough why was John crying let's be honest go to say if the L did not open the book did not open the se he says the whole human was going to perish do you see can I shock you if you don't go until receiving the adoption the token there is a room of backsliding do you know that the cic church today is the original church and Hallelujah but today they are the Beast why they did not go all the way do you see my brother my sister that's serious why was joh crying he had the new and brother said if the seals were not open the whole un was going to perish and brother says when the lamb broke the seals John was rejoicing he saw his name in the PO so the real day of redemption is not when you receive the new P when the seals are open when you receive the token when you receive the adoption how many say a new is not enough how many people received a new p and went back others are drinking today others are committing but they once received a new evidence that you have received is going all the way with the word let go all the way from unto adoption am circumcision alone which is the new bir was not enough can I read it close do you love him do you love him are you still happy what was the promise that was given to Abraham friends I want to ask what was the promise God promised Abraham to give him Isaac are we together but before Isaac came what happened Abraham was circumcised what was the circumcision it was the new Hallelujah do you love him I just want to go back to that quation don't worry I just read that one are you being blessed are you happy huh I just want you to see what brother says here so Abraham before he received his inheritance he he was circumcised first hallelujah amen don't why we are going to find it it's just it flied here don't worry we are almost there I just want to read that and we see what brother says he says now if you haven't got the token you are not coming in first 15 if the token was not displayed the token wasn't shown down there listen even the Covenant wasn't in event you say where now brother now wait just a minute brother that's exactly right the token oh this is serious brother says the token I'm reading was above the Covenant the name the token was above May someone display today the token was above the covenant What is the cing circumcision the new bed so the token is above the new bed I'm read the toen is the highest verion of the new B it's 24 above can I read it again that token was above the Covenant for Israel had a covenant to be circumcised and any Jew could go out L that's what some parents do any Jew could go out and show any person I can prove to you I am circumcised I am a Jew I am circumcised according to Jehovah's command but yet that didn't expel if the token wasn't there also he must display the token did you get it did you get itall even if you were circumcised that without the blood you were going to die without the token you are going to die because the token is [Music] above how many understand this let's [Applause] stand is the king of K oh the mesiah is the Lord the messiah messiah the Messiah [Music] Mah the Messiah let's
