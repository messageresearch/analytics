[1:31] holy name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:33] Christ amen let's give the Lord a good
[1:35] hand clap of Praise amen he's worthy to
[1:38] be praised amen so I pray amen everyone
[1:40] is blessed amen sister Lily is back from
[1:43] a little vacation I'm sure brother sun
[1:45] is very happy Amen to have a back praise
[1:48] the Lord amen so everyone feeling good
[1:51] amen let's turn to our Bibles our swords
[1:54] pull out our swords this morning as we
[1:56] go into battle amen
[2:02] we want to Center our thoughts on
[2:03] Jehovah nii and we know that nii means
[2:07] the Lord is our Banner amen it was one
[2:10] of the Redemptive names of the Lord of
[2:12] our Our God Amen before he became
[2:14] manifest in Jesus Christ and one of that
[2:17] names is nii and that name means Banner
[2:21] another name could mean a standard
[2:23] that's raised amen so we'll send to that
[2:26] and amen we'll title it amen the Holy
[2:29] Ghost is raised a banner or a standard
[2:33] in this day amen we can also say it
[2:36] another way that the angel of God is
[2:38] here raising a standard praise the Lord
[2:41] so let's go to Exodus chapter
[2:45] 17 we'll read from verse
[2:58] 8 this this is the time where
[3:01] Moses amen the prophet Moses is still
[3:05] amen leading the children of
[3:07] Israel and 17 starts there with water
[3:11] coming out of the Rock from verse 8 then
[3:14] came amalec and fought with Israel in
[3:17] refidim and Moses said to Joshua choose
[3:22] us out men and go out fight with amalec
[3:27] tomorrow I will send stand on the top of
[3:30] the hill with the rod of God in my hand
[3:34] so Joshua did as Moses had said to him
[3:37] and fought with amalec and Moses Aaron
[3:40] and er went up to the top of the
[3:43] hill and it came to pass when Moses held
[3:46] up his hand that Israel prevailed and
[3:50] when he let down his hand amalec
[3:54] prevailed but moses' hands were heavy
[3:57] and they took a stone and put it under
[3:59] him and he sat there on and Aaron and er
[4:03] stayed up his hands and the one on the
[4:06] one side and the other on the other side
[4:09] and his hands were steady until the
[4:11] going down of the Sun and Joshua
[4:14] discomforted amalec and his people with
[4:18] the edge of The Sword and the Lord said
[4:20] unto Moses write this for a memorial in
[4:23] a book and rehearse it in the ears of
[4:25] Joshua for I will utterly put out the
[4:28] remembrance of amalec from under heaven
[4:31] so that is to utterly slay and Destroy
[4:33] they amen and Moses built an
[4:36] altar and call the name of it Jehovah
[4:39] nii for he said because the Lord had
[4:42] sworn that the Lord will have war with
[4:45] amalec from generation to generation
[4:48] amen so there Moses Builds an altar and
[4:51] he calls it Jehovah ni which is that was
[4:54] symbolizing the standard that Moses had
[4:56] raised which was the banner amen let's
[4:59] go to zah chapter
[5:01] 59 amen this is preluding amen 60 which
[5:06] is arise and shine the light has
[5:10] come amen but God gives a promise before
[5:13] he gets to chapter 60
[5:16] there if we can read here in Isaiah
[5:20] 59 praise the
[5:26] Lord from verse
[5:28] 16 and he saw that there was no man and
[5:32] wondered there was no intercessor
[5:35] therefore his arm brought salvation unto
[5:37] him and his righteousness it sustained
[5:40] him for he put on righteousness as a
[5:43] breastplate amen now we know that
[5:46] Ephesians 6 talks about the breastplate
[5:48] of righteousness so we see it's the same
[5:50] one here for he put on righteousness as
[5:53] a breastplate and an helmet of salvation
[5:56] upon his head and he put on the garments
[5:59] of Vengeance for clothing and was clar
[6:02] with Zeal as a cloak according to their
[6:05] deeds amen now what did we read in
[6:08] Ephesians 6 there that it's the armor of
[6:10] God here God is putting on the armor and
[6:13] he's going to fight for Israel
[6:16] right according to the Deeds accordingly
[6:20] he will repay Fury to the adversaries
[6:24] recompense to his enemies to the islands
[6:26] he will repay recompense so then they so
[6:30] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[6:32] from the West and his glory from rising
[6:36] from the rising of the sun when the
[6:39] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[6:41] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[6:45] standarded against
[6:47] him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion
[6:50] and unto them that turn from the
[6:52] transgression in Jacob sayeth the
[6:56] Lord as for me this is my Covenant with
[6:58] them sayeth the Lord L my spirit that is
[7:01] upon thee and my words which I have put
[7:03] in thy
[7:06] mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth
[7:09] nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out
[7:12] of the mouth of thy seed seed sayth the
[7:15] Lord from ends forth and forever the
[7:17] Lord had blessings to the reading of his
[7:18] word you may be seated praise the Lord
[7:34] amen so we see that this is a time of
[7:37] spiritual
[7:38] warfare and a standard was
[7:41] used in the time of
[7:44] battle ancient armies used to carry B
[7:47] carry banners amen as marks of
[7:51] identification and as symbols that
[7:54] embodied amen what they were fighting
[7:56] for so the banner or the standard must
[7:59] have significance or meaning yes amen
[8:02] it's like a flag we our mod days of a
[8:05] standard is a flag amen a banner
[8:08] something that can be seen from afar it
[8:11] also serves as a railing point for
[8:13] troops when they see the standard raised
[8:16] they know the captain of the host is
[8:18] there whoever is leading the Army is
[8:21] based where the standard is
[8:23] raised amen praise the Lord so we find
[8:26] amen banners were used Amen in Egypt
[8:28] Babylon Persia and the Israelites
[8:31] carried them amen in their March through
[8:33] the
[8:35] desert amen we can we find amen that
[8:39] this is announcement before the battle
[8:42] is won they can raise the standard or is
[8:45] after a victory that they put a flag up
[8:48] there to say that they have conquered
[8:49] territory amen amen so when Moses holds
[8:53] up the stuff of God in the battle here
[8:55] with the amalekites he's holding it up
[8:57] like a banner he he's raising a standard
[9:01] yes
[9:04] amen and by building God an altar he's
[9:07] calling it Yahweh nii or Jehovah nii the
[9:10] Lord is my banner so he's creating this
[9:13] as a memorial to show God's protection
[9:16] and his
[9:17] power amen so if you think of the story
[9:21] every time Moses hands got weary and His
[9:24] Hands dropped the AMCs were winning the
[9:28] battle meaning troops were being
[9:31] injured but the moment he raised his
[9:34] hand up again Joshua and the Army were
[9:36] prevailing over the
[9:38] enemy so that is telling us in this hour
[9:41] that the standard can't be
[9:43] dropped we've got to keep the standard
[9:45] of the message raised high it's a thing
[9:48] sent to defeat Satan and his army the
[9:51] moment we start to drop the standard
[9:53] down amen Satan
[9:56] prevails amen and we read there in
[9:58] Isaiah 59 that he coming in like a
[10:02] flood Hallelujah now we know that when a
[10:04] flood comes it causes
[10:07] Devastation no matter what how secure
[10:10] your property is if there's a right
[10:12] amount of water coming in like a flood
[10:14] it can cause immense
[10:16] damage praise the Lord amen so the name
[10:21] Jehovah nii reminds us that we at
[10:26] War amen but we all also given a promise
[10:31] that we will win this war
[10:33] amen
[10:35] hallelujah so the at the outcome amen we
[10:39] will be Victors we will be victorious
[10:41] right we are declaring before time
[10:43] because we speak according to Romans
[10:46] 4:17 that Abraham believed God and he
[10:49] called those things which are not as
[10:50] though they are we Proclaim our
[10:53] victories beforehand amen amen we don't
[10:57] think what's going to happen we speak
[10:58] our Victory beforehand when we Face a
[11:02] giant amen like David we speak of
[11:04] Victory beforehand today I will give
[11:06] your head to the fouls of the
[11:08] air amen you speak your Victory
[11:11] beforehand amen so when we are facing
[11:15] sudden attacks and maybe we are
[11:17] prolonged sieges in our life the enemy
[11:19] is surrounded us we need to remember
[11:22] that we have authority over the
[11:23] spiritual
[11:26] Realms every one of us as Sons and
[11:28] Daughters of God
[11:29] have authority over the spiritual Realms
[11:31] of God that's what Ephesians is telling
[11:34] us we are now seated together in
[11:36] Heavenly places the bride is gathered on
[11:39] the sides of the
[11:40] north
[11:42] Hallelujah and it's a strategic point
[11:45] the sides of the north because the
[11:47] northern Army amen we know there are two
[11:49] armies in the north one is an invading
[11:51] Army coming to the sides of the north
[11:54] because he wants to sit upon the Mount
[11:56] of the congregation
[11:59] but the Army that's positioned there is
[12:01] positioned under a standard and under a
[12:03] banner praise the
[12:06] Lord so the battle we face can only be
[12:08] won with God's help amen we've got to
[12:11] remember that yes amen so the holy ghost
[12:14] at this time he's raising a standard in
[12:17] the
[12:18] hour
[12:20] hallelujah praise the
[12:23] Lord so like we said the
[12:26] standard or the banner
[12:29] must have significance because it must
[12:32] Inspire the Army no matter how battle
[12:35] scar they are along the way no matter
[12:37] how tired they
[12:38] are amen when they see that standard
[12:41] raised when they see that Banner raised
[12:45] something Rises up within them amen to
[12:47] make them push forward amen yes Lord
[12:50] praise the Lord thank you Lord It's a
[12:53] symbol of Hope in a time of
[12:56] war and it's a declaration of victory
[12:59] when territories are taken so we are
[13:01] moving the standard of the Kingdom
[13:02] forward as we advance the gates of hell
[13:05] and tear down Satan's
[13:07] kingdom amen and as God is opening up
[13:10] the Frontiers to us amen we must and we
[13:13] advancing the kingdom it's our duty to
[13:16] advance the kingdom of God but also to
[13:19] do it with
[13:21] humility amen we know the way up is the
[13:24] way down so we can't be boastful in our
[13:27] speech we speak with au Authority but
[13:30] amen We Are One People of
[13:32] humility hallelujah our speech should
[13:34] not be boastful there's got to come a
[13:37] progression of our Revelation amen so
[13:40] what I I saying we can't be stuck in the
[13:41] stage of
[13:43] diagnosis if we are doing spiritual
[13:45] Diagnostics the spiritual Diagnostics
[13:47] can't be a continual
[13:49] thing sir if you are diagnosing a car
[13:52] for something that's wrong you can't be
[13:55] satisfied with the
[13:57] diagnosis you've got to now repair the
[14:00] vehicle so how long are we going to be
[14:03] in a state of spiritual
[14:06] diagnosis
[14:08] amen so if if the spiritual diagnosis
[14:12] and through the preaching of the word is
[14:13] showing us where we are coming
[14:17] short amen we need to surrender in that
[14:20] area amen and Advance our growth in
[14:24] Jesus Christ all of us how to have a
[14:28] measuring St where we can measure our
[14:30] growth in Christ we can't be in the same
[14:33] place that we were 5 years ago 10 years
[14:36] ago or we can't be going in a worse of
[14:39] condition what is the level of our
[14:41] spiritual
[14:42] growth are we even concerned or do we
[14:45] even measure or track our spiritual
[14:47] growth according to the word of God or
[14:51] are we just satisfied with saying I'm a
[14:52] Christian and I come to
[14:54] church amen
[14:57] hallelujah now there are some
[15:00] things that a minister a pastor can't
[15:04] give to you via
[15:07] impartation if you come in the prayer
[15:09] line and you say pray for me brother
[15:11] pray for me Pastor amen I can't pray and
[15:15] in part I cannot lay my hands on you and
[15:17] pray for you to be able to pray
[15:21] more right if you have a desire to pray
[15:24] more you can't come in the prayer line
[15:26] here and say Pastor pray for me I desire
[15:28] to pray pray more I can't give that by
[15:32] impartation Praise the Lord if you
[15:34] desire to read the Bible more I cannot
[15:37] lay my hands on you to pray for you Lord
[15:39] help him read the Bible
[15:42] more praise the Lord I cannot pray for
[15:45] you to listen to more of the prophet's
[15:47] messages and
[15:49] tapes those things don't come by
[15:52] impartation
[15:54] amen These Are Spiritual disciplines
[15:57] amen amen
[15:59] that we must individually take be
[16:02] accountable
[16:04] for so you've got to be accountable for
[16:06] your own prayer life you've got to be
[16:09] accountable for your own Bible reading
[16:11] time your devotion time you've got to be
[16:14] accountable for the message of the hour
[16:17] amen hallelujah Glory turn to your
[16:20] neighbor and say be
[16:23] accountable praise the Lord we've got to
[16:25] be
[16:27] accountable now there's also something
[16:29] we can read the Bible to learn how to
[16:31] pray but at sometimes we've got to close
[16:34] the Bible and start to pray
[16:36] amen
[16:38] amen you can learn everything about
[16:40] prayer but if you never get down to
[16:42] praying it's
[16:44] meaningless
[16:46] amen so there comes a point in our time
[16:49] where we learn and we understand these
[16:50] principles that that prayer unlocks a
[16:53] realm Amen in the spiritual Dimension
[16:56] that it's our communication with the
[16:58] Unseen World
[17:01] and it's what brings our victories from
[17:02] The Unseen to the seen
[17:05] World our prayer life yes so we can't
[17:09] spend all our time learning to pray and
[17:11] never actually pray neither can I pray
[17:14] give me an appetite for the word Lord
[17:15] you can't spend all your time in prayer
[17:17] asking God to give you an appetite for
[17:19] the word at some point you got to stop
[17:21] praying and open the word and read
[17:23] it yes sir praise the Lord amen amen and
[17:28] I'm praying I'm challenging somebody
[17:30] here this morning especially the younger
[17:32] people because I know you don't read the
[17:35] messages I know you probably don't even
[17:37] read the Bible I know you probably don't
[17:39] even have a prayer life bless me Lord is
[17:42] not a prayer
[17:43] life help me Lord is not a prayer
[17:46] life amen hallelujah remember you're
[17:50] going to be accountable for your
[17:53] life Jesus at 12 years old told amen
[17:56] Mary and Joseph don't you know I must be
[17:59] about my father's
[18:01] business amen praise the Lord now we are
[18:04] so concerned about our boss's
[18:07] business amen we must be there at a
[18:10] certain
[18:11] time we must be there until a certain
[18:14] time we are so particular to follow the
[18:16] rules of work of school of college but
[18:21] when it comes to the rules that God has
[18:23] laid down in his word we have no regard
[18:26] for that yes sir which show shows us the
[18:29] fear of man is greater than the fear of
[18:32] God praise the Lord so we've got to
[18:34] watch amen our actions and what we are
[18:36] doing so these are spir key spiritual
[18:39] disciplines that are required for
[18:41] spiritual
[18:42] growth I was listening to a minister
[18:45] he's
[18:46] probably late 70s or 80 years
[18:49] old and this this man is interviewing
[18:53] him and he said if there was one thing
[18:56] you could give an advice to the younger
[18:58] you what would you do he says now that
[19:01] you have a PhD and all of these things
[19:04] he said now he answers it this way he
[19:06] says if I told you you probably wouldn't
[19:07] even believe me he said I wouldn't even
[19:10] go to Seminary I wouldn't even go to a
[19:14] Bible school I would just read my Bible
[19:17] and
[19:19] pray thank you amen he says I would just
[19:23] read my Bible and pray to grow in
[19:27] Christ now you see we want complicated
[19:31] things but you can do it in the comfort
[19:33] of your home you can read your Bible and
[19:36] pray praise the Lord to grow spiritually
[19:42] Hallelujah so if you want to pray what
[19:45] must we do we must make time to pray
[19:47] more if we want to spend time with the
[19:49] word of God we must make time to spend
[19:51] with the word of God
[19:54] am and it can't be that we are getting
[19:57] upset with the pastor or the
[20:01] ministry amen who are preaching the
[20:03] gospel and they are speaking the truth
[20:05] in love
[20:07] yes we get upset with what they are
[20:11] saying but they're trying to build up
[20:13] your morals trying to build up your
[20:15] character in Christ if you read
[20:17] Ephesians 4:11 he'll tell you exactly
[20:20] what the fold Ministry is designed to do
[20:23] yes amen so what we've got to do if
[20:24] you're studying that scripture you've
[20:26] got to maximize and and draw everything
[20:29] that they are supposed to bring to you
[20:32] am how come we getting upset with a
[20:35] Ministry that is trying to build you
[20:38] up but Hollywood who is tearing down
[20:40] morals you don't speak against
[20:42] that yeah amen Hollywood has spped the
[20:46] morals of
[20:47] people those of you that grew up in the
[20:50] 50s and 60s and 70s you would know that
[20:53] this is the most immoral time and age
[20:55] that we are living in now amen things
[20:58] that maybe we think are common like
[21:00] indecency and women dressed indecently
[21:02] those things were unheard of back
[21:05] then what caused it the
[21:09] television because it desensitized the
[21:14] people woman sleeping around with few
[21:16] men it became
[21:18] glamorous they threw it out in the
[21:20] movies and they corrupted the morals but
[21:22] nobody speaks out against that but you
[21:25] speak out against the
[21:26] minister that he is too and he's
[21:29] speaking on you but you're not speaking
[21:30] out against them that they are tearing
[21:32] down my morals Lord that they they are
[21:35] taking my time that I I can't spend 5
[21:37] minutes reading the Bible but I can
[21:39] spend an hour watching my series I can
[21:43] spend an hour watching a movie amen I
[21:45] don't complain about that I complain
[21:47] that the preacher is too long yes but I
[21:50] complain the series is finished where
[21:52] I'm going to get the next episode from
[21:55] amen oh help us amen yes sir we can even
[22:00] go to friends with a hard drive I don't
[22:03] know if we use hard drives anymore now
[22:05] amen but you know what I mean go to
[22:06] download the movies onto that thing
[22:08] because you must stockpile you must get
[22:10] your
[22:13] stash but the stockpile the word of God
[22:15] we don't want it that's right we don't
[22:18] reach out to our friend brother amen
[22:20] hallelujah let's read the Bible let's
[22:22] let's you see what you drew from that
[22:24] scripture I'll read the same scripture
[22:26] I'll see what I drew from it we can
[22:27] compare notes yes
[22:30] amen

[36:46] powers that are trying to defeat God's
[36:49] people on the Earth it's a time of War

[36:56] to shout amen yes to call you to this
[37:00] Battleground thank you Lord praise the
[37:03] Lord

[37:10] raise the standard via the message of
[37:12] the hour and we are on a mission Amen to
[37:15] answer now amen hallelujah in all areas
[37:18] of Our Lives we are answering the

[38:00] Rapture message there amen for those of
[38:02] you that maybe want to find this in the
[38:05] message let's just read it out of the
[38:06] Rapture message there
[38:09] amen praise the Lord where he's talking
[38:12] about what is a shout now he said that
[38:14] Revelation 10 was a strategic rallying
[38:17] point praise the Lord a shout what is
[38:21] the shout it's the message going forth
[38:24] amen
[38:27] first the living Bread of Life Giving
[38:30] bringing forth the bride so the message
[38:33] of the hour came to bring forth the
[38:35] bride amen let's go
[38:37] on now God has promised to send that
[38:40] again in the last days to bring the
[38:42] bride out of that ecclesiastical mess in

[38:48] hallelujah so okay this sounds
[38:53] like I am the way the truth and the life
[38:56] amen no man comes to to the father
[38:59] but through me it says it's the only way
[39:03] yes there's no other denominational way
[39:07] he's doing it to Shout by the only way
[39:09] it can be done amen and I want to say
[39:12] the only way can be done is revelation
[39:14] 81 Under The Silence of that seven
[39:17] seal because Revelation 10 is the
[39:20] setting of that seven seal can you say
[39:22] Amen to that so there's only one way it
[39:25] can be done
[39:27] praise the Lord that is why this this
[39:29] becomes a banner that's raised over us a
[39:33] standard that's
[39:35] raised Hallelujah this drives fear Into
[39:38] the Heart of the enemy because this
[39:40] brought Revelation T to life and I saw
[39:43] another Mighty Angel and he was clothed
[39:46] with a cloud and a rainbow was about his
[39:49] head yes his feet was as pillars of fire
[39:54] his face Shone like the sun thank you
[39:56] Lord amen and when he cried with a loud
[39:58] voice as when a lion
[40:01] Rose seven Thunders uttered their voices
[40:05] what were they thundering out a message
[40:07] going forth to call out a bride a
[40:10] rallying point amen
[40:13] yes the only way it can be done
[40:17] amen next one praise the
[40:21] Lord the first thing comes when he is
[40:24] descending from the heaven there's a
[40:26] shout
[40:28] what is it is a message to get the
[40:31] people together a message comes forth
[40:34] first amen amen now if he the first
[40:38] there there must be something else that
[40:39] follows right otherwise you'll put a
[40:42] full stop you won't say
[40:45] first Hallelujah so amen that's where we
[40:49] just want to read there to show you that
[40:50] the shout message the message of the
[40:52] hour the message that came by William
[40:54] brandom is to gather you to a rallying
[40:56] point
[40:57] in the
[40:59] fight is to let you know that the
[41:01] captain of the host has come down amen
[41:04] and his weighs the standarded over us
[41:07] Amen to tell us we are now in the final
[41:10] stretch thank you Lord now very quickly
[41:13] I want to say this probably I can use
[41:15] maybe two minutes for this when someone
[41:17] is in a relay a relay is very important
[41:20] for all four members of that relay team
[41:22] to work
[41:24] together each one must pass the Baton to
[41:27] to the other one and they must do it
[41:29] flawlessly if they want to win yes there
[41:33] can't be any stumbles upon the passing
[41:35] of the
[41:35] Bon yes sir there can't be any
[41:39] fumblings
[41:42] Hallelujah
[41:44] right but what if you drop the
[41:49] Baton what if you drop it you can either
[41:52] choose
[41:53] to get out of the
[41:55] race because you feel like it's too much
[41:57] to catch gain ground or if the Baton is
[42:02] dropped you can pick it up and continue
[42:06] the race yes amen right or there's
[42:11] another
[42:12] option the Baton is dropped you can keep
[42:16] running but there's a consequence to
[42:19] that you are disqualified that's right
[42:22] meaning you can't finish this race
[42:25] without picking up from the one that
[42:27] have gone
[42:32] before brother brandom says you find out
[42:35] where you left him where the Baton was
[42:37] dropped Even in our own lives every one
[42:40] of us if there's a spiritual lack you go
[42:42] back and Trace back where you left Jesus
[42:45] Christ but you've got to go back to that
[42:48] point yes sir if you want to continue
[42:50] the race and not get disqualified you've
[42:52] got to get to that point pick it up and
[42:56] run the race with patience
[43:01] amen why there are rules to the game The
[43:04] Prophet says there's rules to the game
[43:06] there's rules to the fight you know

[44:59] scripture coming to mind I must get to
[45:00] it amen hallelujah if the spirit is
[45:02] bringing something to mind we must get
[45:04] to it amen let's go to John
[45:06] chapter praise the Lord let me find it
[45:10] first Hallelujah is he worthy of Praise
[45:13] amen amen amen amen our God is a good
[45:16] God Amen thank you
[45:19] Lord
[45:22] hallelujah praise the
[45:25] lord lord
[45:27] just want to find this very quickly amen
[45:30] if I can find it here I've just got the
[45:31] scripture in my
[45:53] mind let's go to John chapter 6
[46:07] hallelujah
[46:13] amen so here in John chapter 6 we find
[46:16] here there's many portions of the
[46:18] scripture that we can read
[46:20] here you find in chapter 6 verse1 they
[46:24] he feeds the 5,000 amen and then in from
[46:27] verse 15 onwards we find that he's
[46:29] walking on water so these are the
[46:31] miraculous things that Jesus is doing
[46:34] amen
[46:35] hallelujah so we find here from verse 22
[46:38] onwards they come looking for him and
[46:40] Jesus is telling them you don't seek me
[46:42] because you saw the Miracles but because
[46:44] you didn't eat the loaves
[46:46] [Music]
[46:50] right so yeah in verse 20 29 they ask or
[46:56] 28 they say what shall we do that we
[46:58] might work the works of
[47:00] God Jesus said answered and said to them
[47:04] this is the work of God that you believe
[47:06] on him whom he had sent right so they're
[47:09] asking him for his sign and they saying
[47:11] our fathers did it man in the desert so
[47:13] they are still after the bread you can
[47:15] see all the lines of questioning they
[47:17] still want physical bread
[47:21] Hallelujah so I want to get to a point
[47:25] here where the Jew in 41 the Jews then
[47:27] mmed him saying I am the bread of life
[47:29] which came down from
[47:31] heaven
[47:33] amen and they said is not this Jesus the
[47:37] son of Joseph whose father and mother we
[47:39] know how is it then that he say I came
[47:42] down from heaven so Jesus is showing his
[47:46] identification that he's the son of God
[47:49] praise the Lord m not amongst yourselves
[47:52] no man can come to me except the Father
[47:54] which had sent me draw him and I will
[47:56] raise him up at the last day it is
[47:58] written in the prophets and as and they
[48:01] shall be taught of God every man thereof
[48:03] that ha heard had learned of the father
[48:06] cometh unto me amen amen so the point I
[48:11] want to get to here is I'll find the
[48:13] verse now this thing just came on the
[48:15] top of my head I can't find the exact
[48:16] verse but they are questioning Jesus how
[48:18] can you say that God is your
[48:22] father praise the Lord they want to know
[48:26] how can can you say that God is your
[48:28] father because if you say God is your
[48:30] father you are saying you are
[48:32] God because God can't give I have a son
[48:36] and the son be a
[48:38] monkey a monkey has an offspring it's a
[48:41] monkey a dog has an offspring it's a
[48:44] dog so they are questioning Jesus there
[48:47] and they want to know if you are saying
[48:49] God is your father what are you trying
[48:50] to tell
[48:52] us amen hallelujah amen now I'm saying
[48:56] this people here who are raising up to
[48:58] say God is their father Yes hallelujah
[49:01] amen if you are saying God is your
[49:03] father what does it really
[49:05] mean does it mean you are made in His
[49:07] image and
[49:09] likeness hello
[49:12] yes amen does it mean we were made in
[49:14] His image and likeness amen so the F I'm
[49:18] trying to show you that the father chose
[49:19] Jesus to display himself a human
[49:24] Veil but the standard has been been
[49:27] moved because the father has now chosen
[49:29] you yeah amen and the Holy Ghost is
[49:32] Raising you as the standard in this hour
[49:34] yes
[49:35] amen now you can't run away from that
[49:39] that's right if you are called to the
[49:41] running point where you've been called
[49:43] under the Shar message he's called you
[49:45] here for a reason amen now maybe some
[49:49] people misunderstood us I'm going to say
[49:50] it again that he wants to reveal his
[49:52] glory through you and in you now don't
[49:55] mistake that with Glory as in meaning
[49:57] the Praises Adoration of God no we are
[50:01] talking about the glory the sh Glory
[50:04] being revealed to you so that he can get
[50:06] the glory amen sometime when we say he
[50:09] will share his glory with no we're not
[50:11] talking about that we are talking about
[50:14] the visible manifest presence the Holy
[50:16] Ghost the sh of Glory coming into you
[50:19] and making you the Holy
[50:22] Ghost
[50:24] Hallelujah you become a Holy Ghost
[50:27] yes you become a holy ghost son a holy
[50:29] ghost son and daughter of God praise the
[50:32] Lord amen so when we are saying that his
[50:36] glory is fully revealed through us we
[50:38] are the Temple of the Living God Amen we
[50:41] carrying within us Shak of Glory that
[50:44] God has clothed himself with us amen
[50:47] come on say Amen somebody don't run away
[50:50] from this truth right God is clothing
[50:52] himself with you oh yes God wants to
[50:55] show his glory through you you do you
[50:57] know that's his highest amen his highest
[51:00] form of what he's working to achieve in
[51:02] redemption's plan if fully expressed
[51:05] himself through Jesus Christ now he
[51:07] wants to fully Express himself through
[51:09] his bright body oh come on somebody say
[51:11] Amen better than that amen stop thinking
[51:15] about what you must surrender and Just
[51:17] Surrender amen yes I told you stop
[51:20] thinking about praying and pray stop
[51:22] thinking yes I will surrender and Just
[51:23] Surrender yes amen
[51:27] amen Satan will have you in that holding
[51:29] pattern to say okay let's negotiate
[51:30] around this you can surrender this
[51:32] surrender that but don't do this
[51:34] no stop negotiating with the Enemy amen
[51:38] there shall be no peace negotiations
[51:41] yeah there shall be no peace deals there
[51:45] shall be no treaties there shall be no
[51:47] compromise we will stand on every word
[51:50] of
[51:51] God Amen so yeah the father chose the
[51:56] name for Jesus and the name would
[51:58] represent his character now God is not
[52:00] known as just Jehovah nii or Jehovah
[52:03] Rafa or Jehovah Shalom or Jehovah amen
[52:07] Gyra but all seven compound names were
[52:10] locked up in the name of Jesus
[52:14] Christ

[52:19] most exalted name it's the most
[52:22] magnified name it's the sweetest name
[52:25] amen amen it's the most powerful name
[52:29] demons tremble at this name hallelujah
[52:31] praise the Lord amen it's the name above
[52:35] every other name amen the name that not
[52:38] only in heaven but also in
[52:40] Earth Hallelujah the Bible says that the
[52:43] whole family in heaven is named after
[52:45] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are
[52:48] you identified with that name amen and
[52:51] the Bible declares that everything in
[52:53] heaven and everything in Earth shall bow
[52:55] to that name
[53:00] hallu so God has raised the name as a
[53:04] standard amen oh Church of God let's
[53:07] just get to this point and God Jesus
[53:09] Christ has a bride and that bride has
[53:12] his name and you've got to recognize who
[53:15] you are you can't say we're in adoption
[53:17] time and never take control of the
[53:18] father's
[53:20] business amen come on now you've got to
[53:22] start to take authority over spiritual
[53:24] Realms you've got to take author
[53:27] over the principalities and Powers amen
[53:29] rulers of darkness and cast down
[53:31] imaginations and pull down strongholds
[53:33] in the
[53:35] Kingdom God has raised you up for this
[53:38] purpose to defeat the
[53:39] enemy God is going to show Satan amen
[53:42] I've got a bright body on the earth amen
[53:45] hallelujah and they're not going to do
[53:46] it by power not by might but by the
[53:49] spirit of God Amen when the enemy comes
[53:52] in like a flood the Lord will raise up a
[53:54] standard amen yes Lord
[53:57] Lord praise the Lord amen so the
[54:01] standard over a sick person is the
[54:02] standard of healing
[54:04] raer the standard over somebody that is
[54:07] lost is standard of
[54:09] Salvation amen the standard over those
[54:12] that are bound and lost is the standard
[54:14] of

[54:52] amen after four Church ages I'm closing
[54:54] now amen after four Church ages amen I
[54:57] had gone forth the church was all but
[54:59] dead the the Catholic church had gone
[55:01] out in a deception right and the church
[55:04] was like almost dead Tian Church
[55:08] age praise the Lord amen but the Lord
[55:12] declared in the word I will restore say
[55:15] the
[55:16] Lord amen oh be thankful for the spirit
[55:19] of his son the Bible declares if that
[55:22] same spirit that Rose Jesus from the
[55:24] dead dwells in you it will also Quicken
[55:27] your mortal body so the Holy Ghost is
[55:29] the spirit of Resurrection thank you
[55:33] because you are s God had sent forth the
[55:35] spirit of his son two
[55:38] sons God had sent the Holy Ghost which
[55:41] is the spirit of Resurrection he said
[55:43] because he raised Jesus from the dead
[55:45] because that Spirit has come upon you
[55:47] you shall not die but you shall live yes
[55:51] amen thank you Lord so the church the
[55:53] enemy thought after four amen after the
[55:56] fourth ride that he had the church but
[56:00] God raised up a standard Hallelujah God
[56:03] raised up a standard called Luther to
[56:05] hold the banner the standard amen the N
[56:08] of justification
[56:11] amen than you Lord praise the Lord they
[56:14] were they were taking money from the
[56:16] people and they were charging them
[56:17] penants and amen and charging them amen
[56:20] for purgatory and and all of these
[56:22] things all these rituals not found in
[56:24] the word of God and one day the Lord
[56:27] opens up this word to lther and he says
[56:31] the just shall live by faith
[56:33] amen the Lord raising up a standard
[56:37] amen praise the Lord amen but you can't
[56:41] look past the veil if you want to ident
[56:44] if you want to acknowledge the work of
[56:47] justification you can't look past Luther
[56:49] that's right
[56:51] amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen
[56:55] amen
[56:57] do you hear what I'm saying God's Avenue
[57:01] God's ambassadors are men yes amen
[57:06] hallelujah God's ambassadors are always
[57:09] men you can't have justification without
[57:12] Luther you've got to identify Luther as
[57:15] the man that God raised up to hold up
[57:17] the standard of
[57:20] justification God's not in the business
[57:22] of bypassing the many he used right
[57:26] hallelujah
[57:28] amen you know why we pray that way too
[57:30] because we heard somebody else pray it
[57:32] Lord I don't want to take this man out
[57:34] the way
[57:36] Lord the man go out the way are you
[57:38] going to he preaching you heard somebody
[57:41] say that in their prayer and you thought
[57:42] it sounds nice so you
[57:46] prayed
[57:48] Hallelujah you know many of our prayers
[57:49] are denominational prayers we heard it
[57:51] like passed
[57:52] down we got to pray with Revelation amen
[57:56] pray with
[57:58] understanding
[58:02] amen so God raised up the standard of
[58:05] Luther but when Luther had raised the
[58:08] standard and he moved the standard
[58:10] forward as much as he could because you
[58:12] know they denominated amen if you can
[58:15] find that quote they were uh in the San
[58:17] Church age if you have got it there God
[58:20] used him to bring the people God's
[58:22] standard against works so God was using
[58:25] Luther to raise a standard against Works
[58:28] yes the just shall live by faith at
[58:32] first he had been so gentle so Fearless
[58:35] so patient constantly waiting on God to
[58:37] work out the problems but then vast
[58:40] numbers began to come to his
[58:44] Banner see they were coming to the
[58:46] standard that he was raising their
[58:49] purpose was not a truly spiritual one
[58:52] rather they had political
[58:54] motivations they order to break the Yoke
[58:57] of the Pope they dislike sending money
[58:59] to Rome Fanatics rose up soon he was
[59:02] dragged into Political Affairs and
[59:04] decisions that actually lay outside the
[59:07] realm of the church except that the
[59:09] church through prayer preaching and
[59:11] conduct might set up a standard to be
[59:14] heeded amen these problems of political
[59:18] politics mounted until he was forced
[59:20] into an untenable position of mediating
[59:22] between Lords and peasants his decisions
[59:25] were so wrong that an uprising took
[59:27] place and thousands were killed he meant
[59:30] well but once he had let himself be
[59:32] entangled again in a church State gospel
[59:34] he had to reap the
[59:37] worldwind that's in the San Church
[59:40] age so Luther was meant to raise the
[59:43] standard of justification and move it
[59:45] forward as much as he could yes sir
[59:49] because his advancing the
[59:51] kingdom and when he moved it as much as
[59:54] he could God raised up Wesley
[59:56] Amen to raise up another standard amen
[1:00:00] the standard of
[1:00:02] sanctification the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:05] amen hallelujah and then when when when
[1:00:07] Wesley had raised up the standard of
[1:00:09] sanctification and he moved it as far as
[1:00:12] he
[1:00:14] could God raised up William sour and the
[1:00:17] early isua sweet
[1:00:19] Revival the early Pentecostal sweet
[1:00:21] Revival to raise the standard of the
[1:00:23] Holy Ghost outpouring with the
[1:00:25] restoration of the gifts to the church
[1:00:27] amen and then they started to move out
[1:00:30] and move out and take the battle forward
[1:00:33] sir take the standard forward Take N
[1:00:38] forward
[1:00:40] amen and we know the standard Banner
[1:00:42] raised amen
[1:00:44] hallelujah can cause reputational damage
[1:00:47] you know what's reputational
[1:00:49] damage most time when you say the word
[1:00:52] reputational damage you look at it I'm
[1:00:54] causing reputational damage upon myself
[1:00:57] no but I'm saying your reputation will
[1:00:59] cause damage upon the enemy's
[1:01:03] territory what is that knowing who you
[1:01:06] are I don't have time to go into the
[1:01:08] quote the prophet says when you know who
[1:01:10] you are Satan becomes powerless before
[1:01:13] you meaning that your reputation and
[1:01:15] knowing who you are he rendering this
[1:01:17] devil powerless and you are causing
[1:01:20] reputational damage by knowing who you
[1:01:24] are praise the the Lord go quickly they
[1:01:27] will find reputational damage Joshua
[1:01:29] chapter
[1:01:30] 2 amen let's read it from the Bible
[1:01:33] you'll know what I'm talking
[1:01:35] about your name can go before you and
[1:01:38] you can cause fear into the ARs of the
[1:01:40] enemy Joshua chapter
[1:01:42] 2:8 it says before the spies laay down
[1:01:45] for the night Rahab went up to the roof
[1:01:47] and said to them I know the Lord had
[1:01:50] given you this land and the fear of you
[1:01:52] has fallen on us so that all dwell in
[1:01:56] the land are melting in fear of you amen
[1:02:01] amen amen meaning when you walk demons
[1:02:04] will be asked to be please let me go
[1:02:07] into these
[1:02:08] Peaks why have you come to torment
[1:02:12] us amen you must see it manifest in your
[1:02:15] life amen why you think they couldn't
[1:02:18] even stand the shadow of
[1:02:21] Peter yes demons couldn't even stand the
[1:02:23] shadow of Peter how many of you want to
[1:02:25] say Lord anoint me so much
[1:02:27] amen that demons can't even stand my
[1:02:30] shadow yes Lord thank amen he says the
[1:02:35] everyone in the land now when they
[1:02:37] saying all who dwell in the land meaning
[1:02:39] they King as
[1:02:41] well fear has fallen on us so that all
[1:02:45] who dwell in the land are melting in
[1:02:46] fear of you for we have heard how the
[1:02:48] Lord dried up the Waters of the Red Sea
[1:02:51] before you you see past experiences are
[1:02:54] driving fear into their hearts
[1:02:57] so what am i showing you here if the
[1:03:00] enemy knows in this day that you are
[1:03:02] following the message of William
[1:03:03] brandham and you are coming after his
[1:03:05] message and you are bringing the banner
[1:03:08] forward they know how William brandham
[1:03:11] cast them out and if you are carrying
[1:03:13] the message forward amen fear struck
[1:03:16] their heart knowing you carry the same
[1:03:17] message amen amen so the message becomes
[1:03:21] your standard Bearer
[1:03:23] hallelujah amen praise the Lord thank
[1:03:26] you
[1:03:28] Lord how you dried up the Red Sea before
[1:03:31] you when you came out of Egypt and what
[1:03:33] you did to sonon and OG and the two
[1:03:35] kings of the amorites across the Jordan
[1:03:37] whom you devoted into destruction when
[1:03:40] we heard this our hearts melted and
[1:03:42] everyone's courage failed because of you
[1:03:44] for the Lord your God is God in the
[1:03:47] heavens above and on the earth
[1:03:53] below go to 24 then the Lord had surely
[1:03:57] delivered the entire land into our hands
[1:04:00] I want to say that is a prophetic word
[1:04:01] over the people of God
[1:04:04] hallelujah that the Lord has surely
[1:04:06] delivered the entire land am into our
[1:04:10] hands amen thank you Lord amen indeed
[1:04:15] all who dwell in the land are melting in
[1:04:17] fear of
[1:04:19] us
[1:04:21] amen thank you Lord so to surrender
[1:04:23] means you lose all your rights and and
[1:04:25] you get another set of rights do you
[1:04:28] know that think of it this way if you
[1:04:31] are a prisoner of war you lose all your
[1:04:34] rights but you follow another set of
[1:04:36] rights which is a prisoner of war
[1:04:38] rights you are you are governed under
[1:04:40] those treaties remember the Rules of
[1:04:43] Engagement we're talking about if you
[1:04:44] capture a prison of War he must be
[1:04:46] treated certain certain
[1:04:48] way praise the Lord so now when we
[1:04:51] surrender to the kingdom of heaven we
[1:04:53] surrendering our rights and we take on
[1:04:56] another set of Rights the rights to the
[1:04:58] kingdom of heaven the rights to
[1:05:00] Revelation the rights to sanctification
[1:05:02] the rights to justification amen let's
[1:05:04] move here amen so what is re doing she's
[1:05:06] revealing the condition of the men's
[1:05:08] heart in Jericho the banner of the name
[1:05:10] that went before struck fear to the men
[1:05:12] of
[1:05:13] Jericho but their pride didn't cause
[1:05:16] them to surrender they fortified
[1:05:18] themselves around walls wall so wide
[1:05:21] that they could have chariot races wall
[1:05:23] so wide that the Bible says Rab's house
[1:05:25] was built in of those walls amen wall so
[1:05:28] wide that they started to have
[1:05:30] conventions and they started to have
[1:05:31] meeting after meeting amongst those
[1:05:33] walls that they
[1:05:35] built
[1:05:38] sir that nobody can fellowship with
[1:05:42] them they've got
[1:05:44] camps right
[1:05:46] walls walled in
[1:05:50] cities but the Lord's army is here to
[1:05:52] pull down all the walls hallelujah amen
[1:05:55] praise the Lord thank you Lord so God is
[1:05:57] going to prove that these walls are no
[1:05:58] match for the standard he was
[1:06:01] Raising Israel's Army so they had to
[1:06:04] March once around the city seven times
[1:06:07] amen six times they they marched once
[1:06:10] but on the seventh day they did it
[1:06:11] differently on the seventh day they
[1:06:14] marched seven times around that wall and
[1:06:17] the priests were blowing the Rams on and
[1:06:19] they were moving through the land amen
[1:06:23] they were blowing the Rams on and it

[1:07:47] of Jesus Christ the banner over us is
[1:07:49] love amen praise the Lord so we know
[1:07:52] amen yeah let's let's find that quote
[1:07:54] improving his word want to close now
[1:07:56] with this amen I got two quotes to close
[1:07:57] on uh I'm I'm being very honest with you
[1:08:00] it's two very short quotes amen praise
[1:08:02] the Lord it says because you see that's
[1:08:04] the one I want to go to amen I want to
[1:08:06] show you as the word of God has come to
[1:08:09] give us knowledge Amen in this hour God
[1:08:11] needs a higher standard that's what the
[1:08:12] prophet is trying to say here amen it's
[1:08:14] improving his word amen hallelujah it
[1:08:17] says because you see sin wasn't known
[1:08:21] then like it is now and when we got more
[1:08:24] knowledge now than we had then and when
[1:08:27] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:08:30] spirit of God raises a standard against
[1:08:32] it and now today we got more knowledge
[1:08:36] more understanding so the rivers of
[1:08:38] unbelief is flowing in
[1:08:41] hard so the there are more rivers of
[1:08:43] unbelief flowing in hard the standard
[1:08:45] must be
[1:08:46] raised a greater
[1:08:50] standard I don't have time to read the
[1:08:52] fourth seal there but the writer is
[1:08:54] coming with a stand standard of
[1:08:57] death his name is called death he's got
[1:08:59] a standard of death and he's riding
[1:09:01] through the land people are spiritually
[1:09:03] dead and don't know
[1:09:06] it but he says when now when the when
[1:09:09] the when the rivers of unbelief is
[1:09:11] flowing in hard God will raise up a
[1:09:13] higher standard amen aren't you glad
[1:09:16] that you are part of the standard yes
[1:09:18] amen amen so the stronger they attack
[1:09:20] the greater the standard the stronger
[1:09:22] they attack the greater the retaliation
[1:09:25] amen I want to let you know Israel has a
[1:09:28] right to defend
[1:09:29] itself I'm talking about spiritual
[1:09:32] Israel you have a right to defend
[1:09:33] yourself you don't have to take every
[1:09:35] attack the enemy is bringing against you
[1:09:37] you have a right to defend
[1:09:41] yourself all of hell has been let loose
[1:09:44] but the standard raised is all of Heaven
[1:09:45] has come down and not only that sons of
[1:09:48] God are coming into the position as gods
[1:09:50] of the earth we are taking back what is
[1:09:52] rightfully ours amen let's go to that
[1:09:55] question what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:09:56] for amen we're closing now with this and
[1:09:59] you'll see how we are going to close up
[1:10:00] the Gentile dispensation God is an pict

[1:10:06] dispensation amen than you Lord and the
[1:10:09] quote back
[1:10:11] there amen some of you who keep saying
[1:10:14] these things I want you to I want you to
[1:10:16] reference this because some of you
[1:10:17] believe that people back then were much
[1:10:19] smarter than us today but here what the
[1:10:21] prophet of God is saying back there they
[1:10:23] wasn't half as smart as today they they
[1:10:25] couldn't make an atomic bomb or any or
[1:10:27] an automobile they didn't have signs and

[1:10:44] things as we have now but and the things
[1:10:47] of mysterious things to try and say man

[1:10:53] and take some analysis and try to prove
[1:10:55] it to make infidels out of people but
[1:10:58] now what we need the spirit of God
[1:11:00] raises a standard what is it is pouring
[1:11:04] in his spirit so the standard is you
[1:11:08] receiving the Holy Ghost everybody
[1:11:10] understanding that he's going to pour
