[5:01] so let's turn to Second Kings chapter
[5:03] two
[5:05] I'm going to speak a little thought amen
[5:07] you know it's our witnessed in that
[5:08] prayer meeting
[5:09] and you'll find the faithful
[5:12] Believers amen come amen we just want to
[5:15] draw closer to the Lord a little title I
[5:18] want to speak on we have a double
[5:20] portion anointing of the Holy Spirit yes
[5:23] amen but even that must be believed by
[5:26] faith
[5:28] must be received by faith amen and we're
[5:31] going to see here how
[5:33] Elisha is going to be asking not God for
[5:37] something
[5:39] you ever notice that yes Elisha doesn't
[5:41] ask God for it yes amen
[5:44] he asked Elijah for it yes amen amen so
[5:48] let's read from verse one we'll read a
[5:50] few portions of that and it came to pass
[5:52] when the Lord would take up Elijah into
[5:56] Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went
[5:59] with Elisha from yoga
[6:02] amen now the prophet teaches us that
[6:04] Elijah is the type of the church yes so
[6:07] there is somebody that's staying with
[6:08] the prophet
[6:09] that's walking with the prophet amen
[6:11] amen amen and that's the true church
[6:13] that's not forsaken William Branham he's
[6:16] our Fort Elijah come on now yes right
[6:20] amen we are message Believers we have an
[6:22] end time Prophet yes that's right amen
[6:26] and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here I
[6:29] pray thee for the Lord and sent me to
[6:31] Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the
[6:34] Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I will
[6:37] not leave thee
[6:40] so he had a choice to make yeah and he
[6:42] is making the choice I will not leave
[6:44] you so they progress in the journey and
[6:46] they come
[6:47] down to better now here they find the
[6:50] sons of the Prophet that went that were
[6:52] at Battle and they said unto him Noah
[6:55] star not know us that the Lord will take
[6:57] away thy master from the head today and
[7:00] he said yeah I know it hold he your
[7:02] peace so you see these people are very
[7:04] discerning
[7:05] nobody told them this
[7:08] but they were operating in the prophetic
[7:10] as well
[7:12] now if you if you understand what I'm
[7:14] telling you out there they're operating
[7:16] the prophetic as well the sons of the
[7:18] prophet
[7:20] amen
[7:22] and they are coming to tell Elisha the
[7:24] Lord is going to take your master away
[7:25] now wasn't there prophecy that these
[7:28] people put out always and they had a
[7:30] prophecy that William Branham was going
[7:32] to be taken away
[7:35] have you heard it yeah
[7:37] yeah you heard it right what's this guy
[7:39] I forget his name yeah yeah somebody
[7:41] like that right
[7:43] but they keep coming now to tell Elijah
[7:45] this and you'll see it's not more than
[7:47] it's not just once they keep coming back
[7:49] to him so
[7:51] they came to Jericho and the sons of the
[7:54] Prophet said where Jericho also came to
[7:55] Elijah and said knows thou that the Lord
[7:57] will take that Master from thy head
[7:59] today and he answered yeah I know it
[8:01] holy your peace and Elijah said unto him
[8:05] Terry I pray he here for the Lord had
[8:08] sent me to Jordan
[8:09] and he said as the Lord liveth and as
[8:12] thy soul liveth I will not leave thee
[8:14] and thee too went on now how many times
[8:17] did he tell him that
[8:20] three times
[8:21] so notice this bride will go all the way
[8:24] into the third pool amen we are not
[8:26] staying he told him to stay in the first
[8:27] pool he said no amen he told him go stay
[8:30] here in the second pool he said no amen
[8:33] amen amen he told him the third time and
[8:36] he went through them all the way into
[8:37] the third pool and you'll see it
[8:39] manifest here
[8:40] amen
[8:41] amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[8:45] and the 50 men now that 50 is typing
[8:48] Pentecost
[8:49] 50s type of Pentecost amen hallelujah
[8:55] and they stood to view of half and they
[8:57] they too stood by Jordan
[8:59] and Elijah took the man took his mantle
[9:02] now here's the important part we want to
[9:04] get to and Elijah took his mantle and
[9:07] wrapped it together and smoked the
[9:09] waters and they were divided either
[9:11] until so that they too went over on dry
[9:15] ground
[9:17] and it came to pass when they were gone
[9:19] over that Elijah said unto Elisha
[9:23] ask what I shall do for thee
[9:29] before I be taken away from thee notice
[9:32] a man is asking another man
[9:34] and Elisha said I pray thee let a double
[9:38] portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[9:43] amen
[9:44] and he said that was asked a half thing
[9:47] nevertheless if thou see me when I am
[9:50] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[9:53] but if not it shall not be so
[9:57] now notice Elijah is not saying anything
[9:59] about the mantle
[10:02] amen and you'll see what the prophet is
[10:04] saying about the mantle amen Elisha is
[10:07] not interested in the mental
[10:09] he's interested in the double portion
[10:11] anointing
[10:15] amen praise the Lord you're getting it
[10:17] amen
[10:18] and he said that was I say our thing
[10:20] nevertheless if thou see me when I am
[10:22] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[10:24] but if not it shall not be so so he had
[10:27] to keep his eyes fixed on the prophet
[10:29] yes yes
[10:31] and it came to pass yes they were still
[10:33] went on and talked and behold they
[10:34] appeared Chariot of Fire
[10:37] and Horses of fire there's the Unseen
[10:39] World now the supernatural World we're
[10:42] talking about
[10:43] amen so did they travel thousands of
[10:45] miles
[10:46] hundreds of kilometers
[10:48] or do they come from a dimension
[10:51] the dimension just opened up yes and it
[10:53] was there
[10:55] and part of them both asunder and Elijah
[10:58] went up by a whirlwind into heaven
[11:02] and Elisha saw it and he cried my father
[11:04] my father The Chariot of Israel and the
[11:07] Osmond day off and he saw him no more
[11:09] and he took all of his own clothes and
[11:11] rent them into pieces and he took up
[11:14] also the mantle of Elijah
[11:18] and when
[11:23] he took up also the mantle of Elijah
[11:25] that fell from him and went back and
[11:27] stood by the bank of Jordan so having
[11:29] the the mantle is not good enough
[11:32] right you got to put your faith into
[11:34] action amen
[11:36] and he goes back to the bank of Jordan
[11:38] verse 14 and he took the mantle of
[11:40] Elijah that fell from him and smoked the
[11:42] waters
[11:43] and said where is the Lord God of Elijah
[11:47] and when he had us when he also had
[11:50] smitten the waters they parted either
[11:53] until the and Elijah went over
[11:58] okay let's stop reading there we'll go
[12:00] to verse Luke 24 49.
[12:04] praise the Lord
[12:09] Luke 24 49
[12:14] .
[12:16] this is our lord Jesus speaking
[12:20] to go from verse 48
[12:23] and you are witnesses of these things
[12:26] and behold I send the promise of my
[12:28] father upon you
[12:30] but tarry he in the city of Jerusalem
[12:32] until he be endured with power from on
[12:37] high
[12:39] amen the Lord had blessings to the
[12:41] reading of his word may be seated
[12:43] amen so the prophet is teaching us that
[12:46] that enduring of power from an eye is
[12:49] similar to Elijah's anointing going on
[12:53] in a double portion too
[12:55] Elisha
[12:56] he says Jesus walked the same way when
[13:00] Elijah left he sent a double portion
[13:02] upon Elijah Elijah when Jesus left he
[13:05] sent us his holy spirit
[13:07] amen hallelujah so the church is not a
[13:10] defeated Church
[13:13] Jesus didn't want us to be a defeated
[13:15] church amen Jesus came to put the power
[13:17] back in the church
[13:19] amen so you'll find in Elijah's Ministry
[13:22] the prophet will teach us there was four
[13:23] Miracles but in Elijah there was eight
[13:26] yeah so he was doing the Greater Works
[13:29] amen
[13:30] so he says that the church tonight ought
[13:33] to be operating under a double portion
[13:35] of the spirit amen amen amen watching
[13:38] Christ
[13:39] longing for Christ
[13:42] searching for his presence
[13:44] Amen laboring to enter into his presence
[13:47] amen they are definitely anointings and
[13:50] we were trying to touch on that image
[13:51] they had demonic influences their
[13:53] demonic anointings and you can be
[13:55] attached to that anointing yes now don't
[13:57] get confused now you say oh can I be
[14:00] filled with the Elijah's anointing
[14:02] double portion anointing and the Holy
[14:04] Spirit you know people get confused when
[14:06] it comes to the spiritual things of God
[14:08] but it's not hard for us to believe that
[14:11] thousands of demons can possess one man
[14:16] that a legion can possess one man
[14:21] that's why the prophet says watch now
[14:23] sometimes you take your pastor spirit
[14:25] instead of the Holy Spirit
[14:27] he says you're watching past tonight he
[14:29] says amen and you find after a while if
[14:32] they take his Spirit they'll say Amen
[14:36] Hallelujah
[14:38] and if your pastor likes jumping around
[14:40] I wish some of you take this
[14:44] amen then you'll find the church jumping
[14:46] around amen but what is it it's the
[14:48] atmosphere that's created it's the
[14:51] influence
[14:52] amen hallelujah so God that's what he's
[14:55] doing tonight he wants the church to
[14:57] watch him to observe his ways and to
[14:59] observe how he's moving
[15:02] keep our eyes focused like Elisha kept
[15:04] his eyes on Elijah amen and the prophet
[15:07] tells us he couldn't keep his eye on the
[15:09] world and keep his eye on Elijah amen he
[15:13] had to be single line he had to keep
[15:15] both eyes fixed on Elijah amen amen
[15:19] he says the trouble of it now is we got
[15:22] too many Christian people professing
[15:24] Christians got one eye on the world and
[15:27] the other on the cross
[15:29] amen
[15:31] you'll fall as sure as the world let
[15:34] your eyes be single let your heart be
[15:36] single let your thoughts be single he
[15:39] says brother that rubs in but that hurts
[15:41] but it's good yeah yeah
[15:43] amen
[15:45] hallelujah praise the Lord now he also
[15:49] goes on to tell us that
[15:51] God takes his man of the sin but never
[15:53] his Spirit yeah
[15:55] amen
[15:57] Hallelujah you'll find this in the
[15:59] message the hour is come amen
[16:02] God takes his Spirit from the Earth
[16:05] oh sorry God takes the man from the
[16:07] Earth but never his Spirit right he says
[16:09] do you know that he took Elijah Elijah
[16:12] but a double portion of Elijah's Spirit
[16:14] come upon Elisha and several hundred
[16:17] years he came out in John the Baptist
[16:18] and he's predicted to come out again in
[16:21] the last day is that right God takes his
[16:24] man but not his Spirit his Spirit
[16:25] remains here he says when his spirit's
[16:28] gone then the church is gone there's no
[16:30] more salvation no more care Mercy is
[16:32] over them the spirit's gone the Holy
[16:35] Spirit was upon the apost that was upon
[16:37] the apostles he's here tonight I mean if
[16:39] you can say Amen
[16:41] you know if I asked the question
[16:44] without the evidence that we've seen you
[16:46] probably would have been skeptical
[16:49] but you notice how all of you raise your
[16:50] hand amen amen amen because you've seen
[16:53] it evident yeah amen praise the Lord
[16:56] hallelujah amen now you don't need to
[17:00] have faith if you got good eyesight
[17:03] if I tell brother Ramesh that's brother
[17:05] Joshua sitting next to you do you
[17:07] believe brother Joshua if you look at
[17:08] him
[17:10] do you need Faith to believe that or can
[17:12] you rely on your senses
[17:14] but if I told you there's an angel
[17:15] sitting next to you now
[17:18] amen you need to believe it
[17:20] with the sixth sense so the things of
[17:23] God must be believed by faith okay
[17:28] so he says I want you to notice
[17:31] the season your father always come
[17:33] paragraph 16. I want you to notice it's
[17:36] the same holy spirit that was in the
[17:38] days of the Apostles amen yes
[17:41] is here now present tense
[17:45] I wanted to soak in now yes because this
[17:48] is the season we're living and this
[17:49] message is called the hour is come amen
[17:53] amen amen amen I want you to notice it's
[17:57] the same holy spirit that was in the
[17:58] days of the Apostles he's here now
[18:01] present tense in this meeting working
[18:03] among the people
[18:04] amen
[18:06] and it behooves us to realize this
[18:10] you see sometimes the presence of God
[18:11] can go unrecognized that it isn't your
[18:14] brother
[18:15] it is your lord Jesus
[18:20] who is here amen
[18:22] and we are all representatives of his
[18:24] yes now we know that's the truth do you
[18:27] believe that's true now that his holy
[18:29] spirit is here he's just as willing and
[18:31] he can work through the people as the
[18:33] people will let him work oh yes that's
[18:35] right that's why the Lord is working is
[18:38] because you are allowing him to work
[18:40] amen hallelujah
[18:52] I know you're not easily offended
[18:53] because nobody ever came to me and said
[18:55] ah bro you spoke to me
[18:57] I know you some rugged not some hotbed
[18:59] plants yes
[19:01] amen you recognize the spirit speaking
[19:03] and calling out the error yes and you're
[19:05] willing to take the correction amen make
[19:08] the adjustments yeah
[19:09] and say Lord more of your spirit more of
[19:12] your anointing oh God you know we come
[19:15] to a place now where we feel like we'll
[19:16] die without his anointing we'll die
[19:18] without his spirits happy if you feel
[19:20] that way amen hallelujah
[19:23] amen amen oh talk about a love story
[19:27] amen the The Love Story between the man
[19:30] and woman is nothing compared to the
[19:32] Love Story between God and us hallelujah
[19:34] amen there's a fire burning within us
[19:37] amen
[19:38] Hallelujah
[19:42] right he he tells us that if any
[19:45] particular man's spirit is upon you will
[19:47] start acting like that man right and he
[19:50] says if I confess to have the spirit of
[19:52] Jesus Christ we should do the same
[19:54] things that Jesus did amen amen amen
[19:58] Hallelujah now it wasn't he says when
[20:00] the Lord appeared to Moses it wasn't
[20:02] Moses it was the angel of God
[20:07] then we had the pull of fire that led
[20:09] the children of Israel and that's what
[20:10] the angel of the Covenant amen and it's
[20:13] the same yesterday today and forever and
[20:15] he says that Let the church the same one
[20:18] that led the church back there in the
[20:19] Natural Body talking about Israel he's
[20:21] the same one leading us the spiritual
[20:23] body
[20:25] right and now you know we got the
[20:27] picture of the pull of fire you can put
[20:29] it up if you got it
[20:30] that's a Vindication that no
[20:33] denomination can boast about

[21:24] amen I just want you to get some things
[21:26] here where the Prophet is saying it amen
[21:29] we find that Elisha wrapped himself in
[21:31] Elijah's rope

[21:47] receive whatsoever he asked for
[21:50] he knew that this Elijah was connected
[21:52] to God
[21:53] and he knew that this man Elijah will
[21:55] not lie to him
[21:57] he had confidence in the man
[22:01] that's why the prophet saying you need
[22:03] to have the confidence in the one who's
[22:04] leading you right if you've got no
[22:06] confidence in him then he says you'd
[22:08] rather go find somebody else who you can
[22:10] have confidence in
[22:12] amen hallelujah so he's coming down with
[22:15] the victim's March he's marching down
[22:17] Onward Christian Soldiers marching us to

[29:48] so if you're reading the story now
[29:51] most people would think it was the
[29:53] mantle
[29:55] that part of the waters
[29:59] amen
[30:01] most people would think it was Elijah's
[30:03] Mantle that part of the waters but
[30:05] remember what Elisha asked for
[30:08] he never told him I want your mental
[30:11] he said I want a double portion
[30:13] anointing yeah
[30:16] yeah right so it was not the mantle
[30:18] sometimes people look
[30:21] at the thing being used
[30:24] oh yes the Holy Spirit bringing this now
[30:26] so here's the metal
[30:29] and you strike the water and you think
[30:31] if I can only get the mantle yes
[30:34] but it's not that yeah yeah so sometimes
[30:37] people chase gifted men yes
[30:40] yes but it's not the Gifted Man yeah
[30:43] amen it's the god amen
[30:46] amen now let's go to 106. you got it
[30:49] let's read from here
[30:51] now he had his on his second-handed rope
[30:53] that's true and many of the people this
[30:56] morning have second-handed robes on but
[30:58] when he comes to the Jordan he realized
[31:00] that the robe alone wouldn't do the work
[31:03] amen yeah he says oh we got schools we
[31:06] have ethics of the Bible down pat we've
[31:09] got all our doctrines better down
[31:11] we've got the woven rope all right the
[31:14] promises we've got it all all we are
[31:16] baptized
[31:18] we're all baptized amen we're very
[31:20] Apostolic
[31:22] we have an Apostolic Faith we believe in
[31:25] Divine Healing we believe in God
[31:27] we believe in the powers we're baptized
[31:30] in the Bible the way the Bible says we
[31:32] receive the Holy Ghost we spoke in
[31:34] tongues we do all that but brother if
[31:37] that's the only thing you need you'll
[31:39] find your lack
[31:42] when you come to Jordan
[31:46] you see now he's taking us to the hidden
[31:48] Mystery
[31:50] he says you may have The Robe of the
[31:53] message search on you oh sorry Methodist
[31:55] Church
[31:57] you may have the rope of the Pentecostal
[31:59] Church on you
[32:00] may have the Rope of assemblies on you
[32:02] or the Oneness or the trinitarians
[32:05] whatever it might be it's only a
[32:08] second-handed rope
[32:10] to begin with that's right some man-made
[32:13] dogmas been taught up so forth like that
[32:15] and even if you have been a Christian
[32:17] and the church has been a Christian and
[32:19] wrote correctly
[32:23] 108 now but when Elisha's standing up
[32:25] visible to the old Bank
[32:29] right he's visible to the old Bank land
[32:31] full of prophets and critics seeing what
[32:33] he would do you know he come walking
[32:34] with Elijah's robot
[32:37] is good otherwise he's educated he's
[32:39] submitted he believes there's nothing
[32:41] wrong with him he comes down to the
[32:44] Jordan and the world is watching him so
[32:46] we need to go to 110 there
[32:51] and when he come down to the Jordan to
[32:53] face the critical world what did he cry
[32:56] amen where is the god of Elijah amen
[33:01] amen
[33:03] you hear what he says now it wasn't the
[33:05] robe of Elijah that done it it was the
[33:08] power of the god of Elijah that's done
[33:10] it
[33:12] thank you
[33:13] amen hallelujah
[33:16] amen it was in the robe of Elijah that
[33:18] done it it was the power of God of
[33:20] Elijah that done it and the thing the
[33:23] world needs this morning is the power of
[33:24] the god of Elijah and if you wondered
[33:27] amen the power of the god of Elijah you
[33:29] might have spoke with tongues and
[33:30] shouted and ran over the floor but what
[33:32] we need is the power of God of Pentecost
[33:34] to produce the lives and things that was
[33:37] lived in that day in the apostolic power
[33:39] amen and by God's help amen hallelujah
[33:43] that's what's been put into the church
[33:45] the apostolic power back in the church
[33:48] amen
[33:50] amen hallelujah
[33:53] a second-handed wrote was all right but
[33:56] he needed a fresh call in his heart from
[33:58] God
[34:00] oh Lord even tonight Lord I need a fresh
[34:02] call I need a fresh start Lord Jesus
[34:05] amen that's my prayer he needed a fresh
[34:09] anointing from God He Wore a
[34:11] second-handed robe when he came down to
[34:12] the river but he needed a brand new
[34:15] first-handed call from God
[34:18] amen or I feel that way because you know
[34:21] what I'm talking about I don't want to
[34:22] say it amen because I don't want to seem
[34:23] like I'm being against something amen
[34:25] but it feels like we've been wearing a
[34:27] second-handed robe all the time
[34:30] if you've got discernment you know what
[34:31] I mean amen hallelujah
[34:34] but we want a brand new first-handed
[34:36] call from God
[34:38] a first-handed power from God to perform
[34:41] the what the miracle amen
[34:43] amen now this next thing is going to
[34:47] really revive you
[34:48] because God is demanding for you to
[34:50] believe the impossible then you must
[34:52] make a demand back right he says don't
[34:54] be afraid to ask God for anything amen
[34:57] yes only spiritual things

[35:41] amen
[35:43] Hallelujah
[35:47] you must demand God or ask God for
[35:50] anything that he promised
[35:53] for I am introducing a God that's
[35:56] omnipotent and all-powerful amen and if
[35:59] I be a servant of God I must do the
[36:02] works of God and if you are Servants of
[36:04] God then you must do the works of God
[36:08] amen
[36:11] here again I must demand God to bring
[36:15] these things to pass because he is
[36:18] demanding me to produce the impossible
[36:20] amen I have to ask him
[36:24] so God is demanding you to do the
[36:25] impossible
[36:28] do you know it's not possible
[36:30] according to science and man to heal a
[36:32] blind man
[36:33] to give man back his side to make a
[36:36] crippled man walk
[36:38] right they're coming now Satan is coming
[36:40] remembers they're reaching the height
[36:42] now with AI yeah AI can give you limbs
[36:45] AI can bypass if you've got a spinal
[36:47] damage and can't walk they can connect
[36:49] you put a chip in your head and via
[36:51] Bluetooth send the signal down to your
[36:53] legs and your legs can obey
[36:55] so they are trying to compete with God
[36:57] Supernatural power
[36:59] why now
[37:01] because there's a church operating it
[37:03] now amen the counterfeit is here
[37:07] amen
[37:10] I must demand of God to bring these
[37:12] things to pass because he is demanding
[37:14] me of me to produce the impossible
[37:21] so you come across somebody like I came
[37:24] across somebody the other day telling me
[37:26] they got a walking with crutches they
[37:29] got a bone four inch shorter than the
[37:30] other

[37:36] my God can heal that right now fix that
[37:39] for you right now
[37:40] don't focus on the trouble amen you

[37:45] absolute
[37:47] these son shall follow them that believe
[37:48] yes amen hallelujah
[37:53] praise the Lord
[37:54] I'm gonna read it again because it's so
[37:56] beautiful I must demand of God to bring
[37:59] these things to pass because he is
[38:01] demanding of me to produce the
[38:02] impossible
[38:05] I have to ask him I have to call upon
[38:08] him and stand there and say God you
[38:10] promised it yes so do you
[38:12] every person
[38:16] amen
[38:17] then he quotes here you shall receive
[38:19] power Acts 1. amen after the holy spirit
[38:23] is come upon you after the Holy Spirit
[38:25] has come upon you after your rope
[38:27] there's a Christian after your faith has
[38:29] set in Christ then you shall receive
[38:30] power
[38:33] now if you're sick this morning and want
[38:35] to be healed I can prove to you Christ
[38:36] gave you the promise the promise is
[38:38] yours if thou can't believe you know
[38:41] that's Mark 9 23 right
[38:43] don't be defeated
[38:45] now watch what he says you're very very
[38:47] very very very very profound statement
[38:49] as I stood preaching on David and
[38:52] Goliath now it isn't a Goliath that
[38:54] hindered me
[38:56] God is laying before me but the thing
[38:58] that hindered me is a lack of faith
[39:02] is the lack of something that I knew was
[39:04] around
[39:06] we need the God I feel this is 119 now
[39:11] this is what we have been crying the
[39:13] whole year we need the god of Elijah we
[39:15] need the power of the god of Elijah back
[39:18] in our church the power to make it holy
[39:20] and call God's word right regardless
[39:24] amen praise the Lord
[39:27] now let's turn to John 11 John 14. amen
[39:31] John 14.
[39:32] praise the Lord
[39:39] I'm not going to be much longer because
[39:40] it's our prayer meeting I'm just
[39:42] exhorting amen and then we'll pray
[39:44] Hallelujah
[39:46] amen praise the Lord Saint John 14 12
[39:50] goddess amen
[39:53] so what did we land in Elijah
[39:57] us amen and he got his heart's desire
[40:03] so if you know how Faith Works did
[40:06] Elijah have faith
[40:08] did he already believe he has received
[40:11] it
[40:12] that's how Faith operates
[40:14] believe that you have already received
[40:16] what you have asked for
[40:18] you so if we know how Elijah received it
[40:21] Elisha when he asked Elijah even though
[40:24] he didn't feel anything he believed he
[40:25] already had it right and when the test
[40:27] came and he proved and he asked where's
[40:29] the god of Elijah and he struck towards
[40:31] us the proof was there
[40:33] you could be walking around a simple
[40:35] humble young man a simple angle brother
[40:37] simple humble sister
[40:40] but in the time
[40:41] you were asked
[40:43] in the time of need
[40:46] you know the prophet Charles of Samson
[40:47] wasn't a big-sized man with big muscles
[40:49] and everything that's right and that's
[40:50] why the Philistines were amazed
[40:52] because when the anointing Came Upon him
[40:54] he could carry the gates of the city he
[40:58] could slay a lion
[40:59] that was showing the power of God amen
[41:02] amen yeah brother Joshua was telling me
[41:04] you don't mind to share your test
[41:05] tomorrow amen
[41:07] I know he's full of dynamic quickening
[41:10] power amen and he wants to come and
[41:13] share his testimony amen but he was just
[41:14] telling me today that he's walking
[41:16] through the office and then somebody
[41:18] calls him you know offers an open Office
[41:20] full of people and
[41:23] they're telling you're a man of God
[41:25] my phone's not working come pray for it
[41:28] there are the man of God that other
[41:30] Pastor was it was your pastor the other
[41:32] person the other office they told us
[41:34] that his phone wasn't working one time
[41:36] and he prayed for it
[41:38] so now he's put your open challenge
[41:42] imagine you're walking in office and
[41:43] somebody tell you that what you're going
[41:45] to tell him you think I'm a cell phone
[41:47] you think do I look Pakistani to you
[41:52] amen but if you know who you're walking
[41:54] with amen you know the angel of God is
[41:57] with you so brother Joshua shares the
[42:00] scripture
[42:01] what scripture did you share brother
[42:02] Joshua
[42:04] sorry Mark 9 23 the scripture we're
[42:07] walking in right
[42:09] if that can't believe all things are
[42:10] possible amen
[42:12] so I believe he takes the phone
[42:14] he prays for it and then you started to
[42:17] speak to them
[42:19] and as they speaking
[42:22] the person notices the phone
[42:24] and screams my phone is working amen
[42:28] amen amen amen
[42:30] hallelujah you see he got his Pastor
[42:31] Spirit on him now
[42:33] because I told him the other day he
[42:35] wants to compete with me now so I gotta
[42:36] watch this I prayed for the phone
[42:38] into what now you see
[42:42] amen but that you know that inspires one
[42:45] another's faith
[42:46] amen these testimonies Inspire one
[42:49] another you remember the time you shared
[42:51] about your
[42:55] so when he had the same problem he said
[42:57] you refer to your testimony so these
[43:00] things
[43:01] rub off of one another it builds the
[43:03] faith amen I remember one time
[43:06] when I was sharing the testimony about
[43:07] how I prayed and I said Lord send your
[43:10] angel to go touch that baby
[43:12] then brother Jaffa told me when he's was
[43:14] it your mom that was sick
[43:17] he remembered that testimony he said
[43:18] Lord you can send your angel to touch my
[43:21] mom
[43:22] amen hallelujah so that's what
[43:25] testimonies are therefore
[43:27] amen hallelujah I'm reminded now the
[43:30] prophet was telling us about this one
[43:32] story that this woman came into the
[43:34] prayer line and she had an anchor over a
[43:36] face like this and he was wondering why
[43:38] she was doing that and he was still
[43:40] operating under the vibration of the
[43:42] hand and she touched his coat and he
[43:44] says we were moving the fast line and
[43:46] she didn't want to let go of him and
[43:48] then he told then why when because she
[43:51] touched him that vibration went through
[43:53] his body and he could discern what was
[43:54] wrong with her and he says woman do you
[43:56] know you have cancer and just as he said
[43:58] that she lowered the Anki and you saw
[44:00] her nose was all eaten
[44:04] it was all eaten up
[44:07] and she told him
[44:10] I've been looking for you all over
[44:12] I've been believing for you to meet you
[44:15] and I believe the Lord will be able to
[44:17] touch me and the Lord said the prophet
[44:18] says you know that's very good faith you
[44:20] got and he prayed for and he says he met
[44:22] a son a few weeks later and he says his
[44:25] mother is a changed woman so she went
[44:27] back to the doctor
[44:29] and the doctor couldn't recognize her
[44:34] the doctor says what happened to you
[44:38] she says well I changed doctors because
[44:40] she had a new nose
[44:41] amen amen
[44:45] amen I'll put that quote up on the
[44:47] WhatsApp group you can read it she had a
[44:49] new nose amen and she told that doctor I
[44:53] changed my doctor she says the doctor
[44:55] says oh what's his name she says Dr
[44:56] Jesus amen amen the doctor says oh I
[45:00] never heard about him he says where does
[45:02] he operate from he says he operates from
[45:04] glory
[45:05] amen praise the Lord you know the
[45:07] prophet that ways to dramatize these
[45:09] stories amen so yeah we have John 14
[45:13] verse 12 very really verily I say unto
[45:15] you he that believeth on me the works
[45:18] that I do shall he do also who's going
[45:22] to do it the one that believes on Jesus
[45:26] and Greater Works and these shall he do
[45:29] because I go unto my father
[45:31] now he hasn't asking that the Lord is
[45:33] going to ask you in the next verse amen

[46:32] that if it wasn't important for Jesus he
[46:35] wouldn't have put that there yes

[52:21] if you will let's bow our heads
[52:24] paragraph 29 right
