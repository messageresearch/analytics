[0:00] so this morning we'll speak on a people
[0:01] with vision
[0:02] amen a people with vision will turn to
[0:05] Proverbs 28 and verse 19.
[0:09] [Music]
[0:14] Proverbs 28 and verse 19.
[0:18] [Music]
[0:20] we'll take one portion of the scripture
[0:22] and it says where there is no vision the
[0:26] people perish
[0:28] where there is no vision the people
[0:30] perish may the Lord have blessings from
[0:33] the reading of his word may be seated
[0:35] amen
[0:37] Hallelujah
[0:39] amen with the salvation and his family
[0:41] won't be here this week there won't be a
[0:43] next week they're going to Cape Town
[0:44] amen we test the Lord with bless them
[0:47] and also give them a safe journey back
[0:49] amen so everybody feeling good in the
[0:52] house of the Lord amen hallelujah we are
[0:55] rejoicing night and day as we walk this
[0:58] narrow way amen hallelujah
[1:02] so we see amen for our thoughts
[1:05] having a vision
[1:08] now we can forget everything that has
[1:10] transpired
[1:12] in the past up until this point
[1:16] because we cannot do anything to change
[1:18] the past
[1:21] and if we've been walking without a
[1:23] vision and without a purpose I am
[1:25] praying that the Lord will arrest us
[1:27] this morning
[1:28] the Holy Ghost will make us walk with
[1:30] renewed purpose
[1:32] and a new vision for our lives
[1:35] because God has a plan for our lives
[1:37] amen God knows the purpose for our lives
[1:40] the question is are we walking in his
[1:43] purpose are we walking according to the
[1:46] vision that he has for us
[1:48] amen so our scripture says where there
[1:50] is no vision the people perish
[1:53] so in order for us to be prosperous we
[1:55] need to have a vision
[1:58] so being a person of vision does not
[2:01] mean just having natural sight
[2:03] but the word Vision means revelation
[2:08] amen it means having a dream an idea
[2:11] visualizing something
[2:13] and then we know what the prophetic term
[2:16] of a vision is when God shows a prophet
[2:18] a vision exact events that will
[2:21] transpire
[2:22] now our vision
[2:25] can be bled
[2:27] right our vision cannot be doubled
[2:31] otherwise we will be seeing things
[2:34] but our vision I want to say this
[2:36] morning is the word of God Amen
[2:39] amen it is our sure Foundation
[2:42] amen and it must be the word of God
[2:45] otherwise we will be like a ship without
[2:48] a sail and we will be building upon
[2:51] sinking sand amen so
[2:54] when we say we have people of vision we
[2:57] see things that other people see
[2:59] impossible
[3:00] consider to be impossible
[3:03] we are amen and we are not to be
[3:06] distracted from the vision that we have
[3:08] even though daily we will face
[3:10] negativity we will face criticism we
[3:13] will face Fierce opposition
[3:16] but the vision has been revealed to us
[3:18] amen
[3:19] amen and you have got to believe it with
[3:21] all your heart with all your mind your
[3:24] body your soul and your strength amen
[3:27] when you can believe it like that it
[3:29] will be impossible for the vision to
[3:31] fail
[3:33] amen Hallelujah
[3:38] on our own we have no vision that we can
[3:42] say that we have on our own
[3:45] because when we come to the Lord Jesus
[3:47] Christ the Bible says take up your cross
[3:49] and follow him
[3:52] so if a man is saying he's following
[3:54] Jesus and remember what Jesus says he
[3:56] who puts his hand to the plow and turn
[3:58] back he's not worthy for the kingdom of
[4:01] God
[4:03] so we cannot be wondering about buddhari
[4:06] Vision Without a purpose
[4:09] amen without Jesus we have no vision we
[4:11] are destined for help think about our
[4:13] lives without Jesus right now take away
[4:16] Jesus from our lives right now what is
[4:18] our purpose
[4:21] without Jesus we are lost
[4:23] and the only way we can find our vision
[4:25] is to tap into the vision of God and
[4:28] come God's provided way we've got to
[4:31] come to Jesus and he will give us vision
[4:33] for our lives he will give us purpose
[4:35] for our lives yeah
[4:37] amen
[4:39] and not only that he will give us a
[4:41] vision of his word revelation of his
[4:43] word and he will also give us a vision
[4:46] and a passion for his people and for the
[4:48] kingdom of God Amen
[4:51] amen for far too long people have been
[4:53] walking around without a vision without
[4:55] a purpose
[4:56] if I had to question you individually
[4:58] and ask you what is your vision for 2023
[5:02] please don't be a man that says I don't
[5:04] know we'll see what happens
[5:07] find some time
[5:09] amen and establish a vision and a
[5:11] purpose for your life what is it that
[5:14] you want to do
[5:16] amen let's go to a quote indoors indoors
[5:20] preach 1965.
[5:23] the prophet says here I like a man of
[5:26] vision
[5:28] amen
[5:29] very simple I like a man of vision
[5:33] he says I like people that's got
[5:35] something they fighting for
[5:38] amen amen
[5:41] not just laying around and well whatever
[5:44] comes along will be all right
[5:46] he says oh be up and at it
[5:49] I think every Christian ought to be that
[5:51] way find your purpose and go do it
[5:56] amen
[5:57] he says find your purpose and go do it
[6:04] he says have a purpose in life something
[6:07] you're going to do God has placed you
[6:09] here do something about it
[6:13] amen now just reading that quote we
[6:16] realize that our Lord Jesus Christ was a
[6:19] man of vision
[6:21] he lived in a world where he was so
[6:22] focused and so driven to the purpose
[6:25] towards to your sins
[6:27] we know that he was about the father's
[6:29] business and Jesus did not become
[6:31] comfortable with the word and allow
[6:34] people friends family to influence him
[6:37] or to shift his vision or his purpose
[6:39] amen
[6:42] he was so determined and he did not lose
[6:45] focus
[6:46] now whenever I'm preaching spiritually
[6:48] you can apply it naturally it will work
[6:50] effectively
[6:53] I guarantee you it'll work
[6:55] these are spiritual laws
[6:57] the Earth is governed by the
[6:59] supernatural amen amen when we can tap
[7:02] into the supernatural spiritual laws of
[7:04] God we will become prosperous in the
[7:06] natural amen
[7:09] amen then the Bible says seek ye first
[7:11] the kingdom seeking first the
[7:13] supernatural seeking first to spiritual
[7:16] amen because the kingdom is not Earthly
[7:19] the kingdom is Supernatural
[7:21] amen
[7:23] so we find Jesus was not just laying
[7:25] around wondering and saying I'll just
[7:28] see what happens
[7:30] at any point in Jesus life when he was a
[7:33] boy whether he was a young man if you
[7:35] asked him he would tell you what his
[7:37] purpose was
[7:38] amen he knew exactly what his purpose
[7:41] was on Earth at 12 years old Mary and
[7:43] Joseph came to him and thinking they had
[7:46] lost him
[7:47] and Jesus shot them
[7:50] by telling them don't you know that I
[7:53] must be about my father's business
[7:55] [Music]
[7:57] so the father's business became his
[7:59] purpose
[8:00] his purpose was his vision and his
[8:04] vision became his passion
[8:06] he became passionate about it that
[8:09] everything Jesus began to say and do was
[8:12] concerning the vision that he had
[8:15] the vision of redemption
[8:19] ugly look even at 30 years old
[8:21] Jesus comes to the prophet John in the
[8:24] water to be baptized and John feeling
[8:26] unworthy says Lord I need to be baptized
[8:29] of you
[8:31] but Jesus knew that the vision and the
[8:35] prophecy must be fulfilled and he told
[8:38] John in Matthew 3 15.
[8:41] it says that Jesus answering said unto
[8:43] him suffer it to be so now for thus it
[8:47] becomes us to fulfill all righteousness
[8:51] the Bible says then he suffered in
[8:55] amen so what is the Lord Jesus telling
[8:58] John here we've got to fulfill our
[9:00] scripture in a modern age when they tell
[9:03] us does baptism really matter yes it
[9:06] does
[9:08] amen
[9:10] otherwise Jesus would not have
[9:12] commissioned the disciples to go and
[9:15] baptize in the name of the father and of
[9:17] the son and of the Holy Spirit
[9:19] the Holy Ghost falling on the day of
[9:21] Pentecost would not be speaking to Peter
[9:24] and tell him repent every one of you and
[9:27] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[9:29] for the remission of your sins
[9:33] amen we do not need to intellectualize
[9:35] it
[9:36] we do not need to say oh it doesn't
[9:38] really matter
[9:39] we must fulfill our scripture
[9:43] amen so Jesus did not accept
[9:46] circumstances
[9:48] you don't accept just any circumstance
[9:51] that comes into your life anything that
[9:53] never presents you do not accept it amen
[9:55] yes amen do not be coming so you know
[9:59] some people are so accommodating don't
[10:01] accommodate the devil don't accommodate
[10:03] his schemes the devil is out to destroy
[10:06] your vision
[10:07] yes
[10:09] amen
[10:11] Hallelujah think of our lovely Lord
[10:13] Jesus now
[10:15] amen yeah he's walking the Earth as a
[10:18] man
[10:19] and he does not accept any circumstance
[10:22] that comes his way
[10:25] amen and if you are associated with
[10:28] Jesus neither should you amen
[10:31] because Mary in her association with
[10:33] Jesus did not want to accept the
[10:36] situation that there was he had run out
[10:38] of wine
[10:39] it wasn't Jesus that asked for what to
[10:42] be to be turned into wine it was Mary
[10:45] it was Mary's desire in fact it was
[10:49] Mary's vision
[10:50] that Jesus was going to turn things
[10:53] around amen
[10:55] amen so if you are if you are associated
[10:58] with Jesus amen that's just him amen yes
[11:01] amen don't just leave him sitting there
[11:03] while there's no wine while there's no
[11:06] stimulation of Revelation amen activate
[11:09] the gift and say Amen Jesus they have
[11:13] run out of wine and even if the answer
[11:15] is negative pursue the cause
[11:19] Mary told us people do whatsoever Jesus
[11:22] tells you to do
[11:25] amen
[11:26] Hallelujah
[11:28] the man who died his friends refused to
[11:31] accept that he was dead
[11:33] Jesus was preaching in a house
[11:36] there was no way to enter the house
[11:38] so these men took off the roof
[11:42] they refused to accept the circumstance
[11:45] amen amen and they lowered the man into
[11:48] the presence of Jesus
[11:51] amen at all costs get to Jesus Amen in
[11:55] all situations get to Jesus
[11:58] amen
[11:59] Hallelujah this man the Lord Jesus
[12:02] Christ was so full of power so full of
[12:05] the anointing his eye was so fixed on
[12:07] the vision that was given to him amen
[12:09] amen and one day he came into the temple
[12:12] and he took the book and he told him
[12:14] exactly what the vision was amen amen
[12:17] prophecy had been fulfilled but he was
[12:20] not referring back to a zionine prophecy
[12:22] he was not referring to other prophecies
[12:25] amen a voice crying in the wilderness he
[12:28] was referring to our present tense
[12:30] prophecy yes amen amen he was showing
[12:34] them what Jesus is doing now present
[12:36] tense
[12:37] I hope we're learning this morning amen
[12:40] amen when people are wondering what is
[12:42] God doing is God silent take them to the
[12:45] World open them up to scripture in
[12:47] Revelation 10 is our scripture Our
[12:49] present-day reality show them what God
[12:52] is doing in 2023 amen
[12:56] amen
[12:58] Hallelujah Jesus opens up the scripture
[13:01] and he says the spirit of the Lord God
[13:03] is upon me yes can you say that this
[13:06] morning amen amen can you say that we're
[13:08] not a shed off a doubt that the spirit
[13:10] of the Lord God is upon us yes well it
[13:13] ought to be amen we ought to be baptized
[13:15] with the Holy Ghost
[13:17] amen because the Lord God had anointed
[13:21] me you can pick this up in his eyes 61
[13:23] and verse 1. let's see what our lord
[13:25] Jesus is saying the Lord had anointed me
[13:29] amen we're learning now we must be
[13:33] anointed
[13:34] Amen to preach Good Tidings unto the
[13:37] meek so no problem when people don't
[13:39] want to preach they have not been
[13:40] anointed to preach
[13:44] amen you know there's a movement going
[13:47] on saying Don't Preach they're not
[13:48] anointed to preach
[13:51] amen but if you have been anointed to
[13:54] preach Good Tidings into the meek then
[13:56] you must fulfill that vision
[13:58] you must fulfill that purpose
[14:02] he had sent me to bind up the
[14:03] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[14:06] captives
[14:07] and the opening of prison to them that
[14:10] are bound
[14:12] amen
[14:13] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[14:16] Lord what is the acceptable year of the
[14:18] Lord it is the Year of Jubilee where you
[14:21] can go free as Sons and Daughters we are
[14:24] free he of the son of man is set free
[14:27] he's free indeed
[14:29] amen we are no longer bound by tradition
[14:32] of man we are no longer bound by
[14:34] denominational ideas man made religion
[14:37] amen but we have been set free and
[14:40] liberated by God almighty
[14:43] amen hallelujah
[14:46] he says and now this is the part Jesus
[14:49] cut it off there in the middle of that
[14:50] sentence when he said to proclaim the
[14:53] acceptable here of the Lord but now that
[14:56] he has come inside of man ministry again
[14:58] he's come to activate the second part of
[15:01] that prophecy
[15:03] amen many many men that's what
[15:05] Revelation 10 is all about amen this
[15:07] Mighty angel coming down with vengeance
[15:13] he says and the day of Vengeance about
[15:16] God took Comfort all that more
[15:19] to a point unto them that morning Zion
[15:21] to give unto them beautiful ashes
[15:25] this is the season where God is turning
[15:28] Beauty
[15:29] amen for ashes
[15:32] your situation may have been burnt to
[15:35] ashes but God is going to turn into a
[15:37] thing of beauty
[15:40] amen this is the season where the oil of
[15:43] joy for mourning the garments of praise
[15:45] for the spirit of heaviness that they
[15:48] might be called Trees of Righteousness
[15:51] amen amen are you a tree of
[15:53] righteousness this morning the planting
[15:55] of the Lord
[15:57] that he might be glorified
[15:59] amen what is it the Christ in me the
[16:02] hope of glory
[16:05] amen I tell you Jesus was so anointed
[16:09] Jesus did not accept any circumstance if
[16:12] you came to him blind you went away with
[16:14] perfect eyesight if you came to him sick

[16:20] him purple you went back walking Amen to

[16:35] the act of adultery you went Unforgiven
[16:38] set free without your accused of
[16:40] accusing you
[16:42] amen hallelujah if you were dead and he
[16:45] brought you to Jesus you were
[16:47] resurrected back to life amen amen in
[16:50] his presence this morning if your branch
[16:52] is withered away if your desire and your
[16:55] vision has withered away in the presence
[16:57] of Jesus you are going to be resurrected
[17:00] this morning
[17:02] amen God has called you into this church
[17:05] for a purpose amen God has called you

[17:17] yourself to the things of God

[17:24] to walk in prosperity this morning

[17:46] your tomb this morning I'm praying that
[17:48] you will be resurrected back to life

[17:52] lord has died maybe your passion for
[17:54] serving the lord has died but this
[17:56] morning may you experience a
[17:58] resurrection
[18:00] amen
[18:01] Hallelujah even when he was dead in the
[18:04] flesh and he was amen he was still
[18:07] fulfilling the vision of God
[18:09] he said destroy this Temple any three
[18:13] days I will raise it up again
[18:15] amen he was not resting in the grave
[18:18] but Jesus was still fulfilling the
[18:20] commission
[18:22] he had a Ministry beyond the grave and
[18:24] he stepped into his teeth in his body
[18:26] and he began to preach the soul that I
[18:28] imprisoned amen amen
[18:31] hallelujah hallelujah
[18:34] he went back and he spoke to them and he
[18:37] told them about the Redeemer that had
[18:39] come upon the face of the Earth and even
[18:41] though they they still had no amen
[18:44] salvation he still wanted them to hear
[18:46] the gospel amen amen
[18:49] amen he wins amen and he preached in the
[18:52] region of the Lost he preached to Saul
[18:55] that I in prison amen and then he went
[18:58] and he entered out paradise
[19:00] amen so powerful was this Lord Jesus
[19:04] that Amen on the third day amen he rose
[19:07] up triumphantly from the grave
[19:09] amen because why the spirit of God
[19:12] raised him up yes and if that's in
[19:14] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[19:17] to help in you it will also Quicken your
[19:20] moral body it'll Quicken the moral body
[19:22] of the river the sleeping Saints amen
[19:25] because Jesus on the cross he cried with
[19:28] a loud voice and the Bible says when he
[19:31] resurrected amen many of the Old
[19:33] Testament Saints resurrected with him
[19:35] yes
[19:36] amen amen
[19:39] so to sum it up you cannot come into the
[19:41] presence of Jesus and leave the same
[19:43] amen
[19:45] you've got the prophet say that many
[19:46] times you will either live better or you
[19:49] live in a worse of condition
[19:51] think of the Richmond ruler did he live
[19:53] in a better condition or a worse off
[19:54] condition
[19:57] yeah amen so not everyone who comes into
[20:00] the prince of Jesus
[20:03] it's you got to do your part and step
[20:05] into the vision Jesus detailed what he
[20:08] needed to do
[20:10] he needed a vision of how do I get
[20:12] eternal life and Jesus outlined it for
[20:15] him oh yes all he had to do was follow
[20:17] it
[20:19] but he rejected that vision and purpose
[20:22] that God had for his life
[20:25] amen
[20:26] we sing that song don't lose your vision
[20:31] of Jesus
[20:33] and keep your eyes
[20:38] [Music]
[20:39] many friends and your loved ones
[20:43] I've lost their ways
[20:47] and they have lost
[20:49] their vision of him amen
[20:57] so my question to you this morning how
[21:00] is your vision
[21:03] is it getting blurry
[21:08] do you have 20 20 eyesight spiritually
[21:13] everyone was waiting for 2020 it was
[21:15] going to be a major celebration
[21:17] but 2020 changed the entire Earth
[21:21] we are still feeling the effects of it
[21:23] Global economies are crashing
[21:30] can you discern the times and the
[21:33] seasons that we are living in
[21:37] this age is prophesied to be blind
[21:41] the eye to the age is the prophet yes
[21:44] he's the Seer
[21:46] after the eye comes the mind
[21:50] and we know the bride is the mind of
[21:52] Christ
[21:53] but in order for us to receive the mind
[21:55] of Christ there had to be an eye to the
[21:57] age
[22:01] and to reject the prophet of the ages to
[22:03] walk blindly in lead us here
[22:07] the Bible prophesies that gross Darkness
[22:09] would cover the people
[22:11] but we know that is 60 says that a great
[22:14] light has Shone for the believer
[22:17] let's turn to Azad Hosea
[22:20] the book of Isaiah 4 and verse 6.
[22:24] people are being destroyed in this hour
[22:25] because they have no vision
[22:29] people are going to church
[22:31] they are religious people
[22:33] then have you believed that they are
[22:35] Christians
[22:36] but Isaiah 4 and 6 says my people are
[22:39] destroyed for the latter
[22:41] of what
[22:43] knowledge yes
[22:45] my people are destroyed for the lack of
[22:48] knowledge
[22:51] I can say they are destroyed for the
[22:53] lack of having a vision of what God
[22:54] wants for their lives I can say they are
[22:57] destroyed because they have no purpose
[22:58] for their lives
[23:00] hmm
[23:02] which
[23:04] denomination can you go to and tell me
[23:06] show me what God is doing now in 2023
[23:09] according to the scripture
[23:12] not what your false prophet is saying
[23:13] hmm because right now
[23:16] the first sermon on a Sunday they'll be
[23:18] prophesying I prophesy prosperity and
[23:21] blessings over you this is your year
[23:23] this is your season
[23:25] tap into the supernatural connect with
[23:28] me partner with me so we see
[23:32] and you know what the people Faithfully
[23:35] do it
[23:36] but here we are in a message and we
[23:38] don't do things
[23:39] some people that we were more faithful
[23:41] to the waiter and gave him 10 percent
[23:43] than God
[23:47] religiously you even get upset with the
[23:49] wife or the white kid upset with the
[23:51] husband to give him 10 percent
[23:53] you're so religious
[23:55] about giving away to ten percent
[23:58] but when God asks you for ten percent
[24:01] you ignored him
[24:04] amen
[24:05] amen my people perish because of the
[24:07] lack of
[24:08] knowledge
[24:09] now knowledge can come to you but you
[24:12] must have an ear to hear right now you
[24:14] could be turning away the gospel
[24:16] the Bible says he's at Athen here let
[24:18] him hear what the spirit is saying to
[24:20] the church let's turn to other kid 2 and
[24:22] verse 3.
[24:24] 2 and verse 2. now if I'm talking
[24:28] spiritual principles because when God
[24:31] had a vision for us
[24:34] what did the prophecy everything is in
[24:37] the word amen amen
[24:40] can I get a better amen than that
[24:42] everything concerning the Plan of
[24:44] Redemption is in the word
[24:47] now he first had it
[24:50] in his first Bible then he moved it to
[24:53] the second Bible the pyramids now it's
[24:56] in the written word
[24:57] so can I say that the Bible is the
[25:01] vision and the purpose of God
[25:04] in what form do you have it this morning
[25:07] in written form
[25:10] so did God write the vision
[25:13] somebody worked with me this morning
[25:15] amen did God write the vision yes amen
[25:18] and apply that physically
[25:21] I'm going to bring this down practically
[25:23] to you because I've seen it work
[25:25] right division
[25:28] don't just ask God for a thing and be
[25:30] haphazard about it
[25:33] let me read first and I'll detail what
[25:35] I'm telling you
[25:37] and the Lord answered me and said write
[25:39] the vision and make it plain upon the
[25:43] tables make it plain some of you are
[25:46] writing like a 17 mystery back to God a
[25:49] silence day
[25:53] God wants you to ask of him and be
[25:56] specific
[26:00] he says that he may run that readeth it
[26:04] what does that mean whoever is meeting
[26:06] him may go forth and fulfill what's
[26:08] written
[26:10] he says for the vision is yet point a
[26:13] point in time but at the end it shall
[26:15] speak amen and not lie
[26:18] though it Terry wait for it that's the
[26:21] problem we humans have now the waiting
[26:24] period
[26:26] very quickly I tell you you remember the
[26:28] man who came into the prayer line
[26:31] you know the story about the blind man
[26:33] right but there is another story of
[26:35] another man
[26:36] he came back into the prayer line he
[26:38] will add like a shaking thing and you
[26:39] had like you know
[26:42] and he came back and he said I'm still
[26:44] got this the prophet says didn't I tell
[26:46] you you are healed already
[26:47] he says go back and confess it the man
[26:50] went back to his country and he's always
[26:52] whichever City he lived and he began to
[26:54] confess it and confess it his mother
[26:56] became so ashamed and said but he keeps
[26:58] speaking things and the people are
[26:59] making fun of him until one day he said
[27:01] it
[27:02] and his body stopped shaking amen now
[27:05] two to the vision amen amen he spoke
[27:07] with a Ponder of confession
[27:09] I don't care if you're
[27:12] from now
[27:13] for the next five years holy positive
[27:16] confession that you were healed amen
[27:18] it's right
[27:22] he says go eat Harry wait for it
[27:26] now if you're asking God for a job
[27:30] what job do you want
[27:32] what do you want to do you don't even
[27:34] know what you want to do
[27:36] but God says go till the ground
[27:41] in that day there was only one form
[27:43] maybe it was farming they had to live up
[27:45] the produce of the earth now we're still
[27:47] living off the Earth whether it's
[27:49] construction Metals whatever it is it's
[27:51] all taken from the earth man is still
[27:53] till the ground everything that you see
[27:55] physically with your eye was taken from
[27:57] the earth
[27:58] namely one thing that wasn't taken from
[28:01] the Earth
[28:02] when man just spoke and it happened and
[28:04] here the microphone appears everything
[28:07] was taken from the Earth
[28:16] it was a seed planted in the Earth
[28:18] a tree grew somebody cut the tree down
[28:22] amen
[28:24] if you are asking God for your wife
[28:30] describe the wife you want
[28:32] write the vision
[28:36] let me go back and and reiterate this I
[28:39] want everybody to go back
[28:41] and write down what is it that you
[28:43] desire of the Lord and put it in a place
[28:46] where you see it every single day
[28:47] because sometimes you even forget and
[28:50] you don't have faith to believe what you
[28:52] ask the Lord you go away you ask now and
[28:54] then you forget about it
[28:57] recognition
[29:01] you want a house how many bedroom house
[29:03] do you want yes
[29:06] do you want a pool what do you want
[29:12] oh you see right now people are not
[29:14] believing
[29:18] my God owns a kettle on a thousand years
[29:22] your small desire you know you want a
[29:24] house
[29:25] you want a house maybe the best areas
[29:27] these days I don't know maybe ballito
[29:29] Durban North maybe umhlanga God is
[29:32] laughing at you and he's saying look at
[29:33] these people
[29:34] they think that's the best
[29:38] because in our minds that's the best
[29:42] but no I have seen
[29:45] no years heard the things that God has
[29:49] in store for us
[29:53] write it down
[29:58] how many of you follow what I'm saying
[30:00] I don't know if you will follow what I
[30:02] am saying
[30:03] and do what I am saying write down the
[30:06] vision
[30:08] if you are sick write it down I am
[30:12] healed put the date that you're
[30:14] confessing it
[30:16] if you want to say I am healed two
[30:19] thousand years ago put it there
[30:22] and I don't want you to ever speak
[30:23] another word of negativity over that
[30:25] situation yes I don't give your close
[30:28] family member and they know that you
[30:30] don't have one leg
[30:33] every time they see you must tell them
[30:34] I'm walking perfectly I have two legs
[30:37] I'm giving an extreme case because I
[30:39] want you to understand what I am saying
[30:43] I am perfectly well
[30:45] I am perfectly healed
[30:51] find the quote God heals through music
[30:56] God heals through doctors
[30:59] I am trying to bring a practical gospel
[31:01] to you
[31:04] so write it down tell the Lord I want a
[31:08] message called
[31:11] I want a message boy
[31:13] I want her to have long hair
[31:17] I wanted to have a Meek and a quiet
[31:18] spirit
[31:20] I wanted to
[31:22] tell the Lord what you desire
[31:29] amen if you if you find it just let me
[31:31] know amen Allah
[31:34] the spirit has brought that to my
[31:36] remembrance I want to
[31:38] amen God heals
[31:41] music God heals through love
[31:44] you know the quote
[31:46] amen
[31:50] so remember what we are speaking about
[31:52] now this morning a people with vision
[32:00] so let's just read from there
[32:03] he says there's nothing like music you
[32:05] know God heals my music
[32:08] did you know that God heals my music
[32:12] now now if we know that
[32:15] might be listening to music Good gospel
[32:17] music
[32:21] now listen the prophet is detailing how
[32:23] God heals
[32:25] will we make it only one way
[32:28] I need to come in the front I need to
[32:30] pass to lay his hands on me and that's
[32:32] it
[32:33] he's telling you God heals my music
[32:36] are you listening to good music
[32:39] are you listening to songs of faith
[32:42] God heals my music listen to the right
[32:45] kind of music
[32:46] because we do not know which way God
[32:48] will choose to heal you
[32:52] amen amen
[32:55] let's change our ways this year
[32:59] God heals my medicine sorry I'll never
[33:02] go to the doctrine
[33:06] God used my medicine
[33:09] is this your Prophet speaking
[33:11] God heals my medicine
[33:13] sometimes you will use the doctors
[33:18] to form their operation
[33:21] to save your life because if you do not
[33:23] have a quadruple bypass you will be dead
[33:27] so God uses the doctors and medicine to
[33:30] give you a bypass
[33:36] you believe God heals my medicine
[33:39] so God he is my medicine
[33:43] and with that now God heals by medicine
[33:45] there are other forms of therapy that
[33:47] God can heal you about because it's all
[33:49] associated with medicine I'm not talking
[33:51] psychology now
[33:54] right
[33:56] God heals by prayer this is the one all
[33:59] of us are familiar with God heals by
[34:01] prayer God has many ways of healing
[34:07] depends on what type that you need
[34:15] sometimes a little love oh
[34:20] sometimes we need love
[34:24] hello
[34:25] yo I'm talking to robots here
[34:28] sometimes we just need a little bit of
[34:30] love
[34:32] to bring the healing
[34:37] when we are down
[34:38] somebody just offers you a bit of life
[34:42] and love can come in many forms
[34:45] many ways you can show love one to
[34:47] another didn't Jesus say let your light
[34:50] shows shine before men
[34:52] now I want you to know what the light is
[34:54] because he's defining a journal
[34:57] that they might see your good what
[35:00] works
[35:02] so he's defining your life to be your
[35:04] works
[35:06] and he says they might see your good
[35:08] works and glorify your father which is
[35:10] in heaven
[35:13] so we are to express love
[35:18] we can express love when someone is down
[35:20] depressed go to them buy them their
[35:23] favorite meal
[35:24] take them out talk to them encourage
[35:27] them
[35:29] play them their favorite song
[35:31] remind them amen
[35:34] pick them up in the spirit
[35:40] I'm sorry this is too practical for some
[35:42] of us this morning but I am a shepherd
[35:45] amen and sheep I'm dealing with sheep
[35:48] and I'm dealing with Lambs
[35:50] amen I'm not an evangelist to come here
[35:52] this morning I am not a prophet to come
[35:55] here this morning neither am I an
[35:57] apostle
[35:58] neither am I a teacher here this morning
[36:02] but I am a pastor so you'll find the
[36:05] message very pastoral this morning
[36:07] because I've got to tap into my
[36:09] anointing and my gifting as well
[36:12] amen
[36:13] and sometimes it may not be the common
[36:16] thing that's being preached
[36:18] but I'm taking a quote and I'm stripping
[36:21] it down for you amen that God he has
[36:23] many ways of healing
[36:25] yes amen
[36:27] amen
[36:29] look at what he says
[36:30] sometimes they love stretched out who
[36:33] just cure an old sore an old place
[36:35] that's gradually you know when somebody
[36:37] hurts you they spoke bad words against
[36:39] you and you've got that little feeling
[36:41] inside there
[36:42] and nobody knows what I'm talking about
[36:49] you know every time you see that person
[36:50] even though you love them and you still
[36:53] the feeling is still there
[36:56] even though you say you made it right to
[36:58] that person
[36:59] you can't really say a good word about
[37:01] that person
[37:03] but you need a little love to heal that
[37:05] thing
[37:06] he says Italy it'll heal right over just
[37:10] a little love a little kid
[37:13] amen
[37:15] now here's our spiritual prophet
[37:19] did he say anything about the word then
[37:24] they say anything else about fasting
[37:26] praying this step
[37:28] what did he say sometimes we need a
[37:31] little love
[37:34] okay sometimes when you feel all down as
[37:37] we call it a street expression down in
[37:39] the dumps see just put on one of those
[37:42] tapes that music or your record and go
[37:45] to playing it
[37:47] the first thing you know you'll be
[37:49] petting your foot or your hand and it's
[37:51] all over there you're right up and ready
[37:54] to go again
[37:55] amen
[37:57] you see
[38:00] so God has many ways of dealing with you
[38:03] this year and in the years to come amen
[38:05] the reason why I'm emphasizing this year
[38:08] we're not sure if this is the year that
[38:10] we will go away
[38:11] from the Earth
[38:14] I can't focus too much on the future I
[38:16] got to focus on what God is doing now
[38:18] amen because tomorrow is not promised to
[38:20] us right now is what we have let's make
[38:24] the best of it amen
[38:27] so to reiterate our lord Jesus was a man
[38:30] of vision and so should his wife be
[38:32] a woman of vision
[38:34] he lived in a world where he was so
[38:36] focused and driven to accomplish the
[38:38] purpose for which we have sent
[38:42] now never allow people because Jesus
[38:44] never allowed the world all our people
[38:47] the friends to influence him right
[38:50] never allow that to happen to you
[38:53] we were going on appointed we read Amos
[38:57] no so we read Hosea 4 6 he says my
[39:00] people are destroyed for a lack of
[39:02] knowledge right then you name us eight
[39:04] and eleven it says behold the days come
[39:07] and save the Lord God I will send a
[39:09] famine in the land not a famine of bread
[39:13] no I thirst of water but of hearing the
[39:16] words of the Lord amen amen amen so what
[39:19] is he telling us there's going to be a
[39:21] time in famine where there's going to be
[39:22] no vision in the land yeah
[39:24] the word of the Lord
[39:26] there's going to be a famine for it
[39:30] so how are we going to get this
[39:33] Revelation how are we going to get
[39:35] spiritual food in due season let's go to
[39:37] Romans 10 and 13.
[39:40] we're just trying to follow a sequence
[39:41] of events here first people are
[39:43] destroyed by lack of knowledge then the
[39:45] Lord is sending a famine not a bread of
[39:47] water but the word of the Lord which is
[39:49] his vision
[39:51] in Romans 10 and verse 13 it says for
[39:54] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[39:56] the Lord shall be saved
[39:58] but then he goes on to elaborate and he
[40:01] says how shall they call on him
[40:04] on whom they have not believed
[40:08] and how shall they believe in him of
[40:10] whom they have not heard
[40:14] and now shall they hear without a
[40:16] preacher
[40:17] yes amen so there's a fair man in the
[40:20] land
[40:21] but the people in order to receive
[40:23] spiritual food need a preacher yes
[40:28] he says how shall they preach except
[40:30] they be sent
[40:32] as it is written how beautiful are the
[40:34] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[40:36] peace and bring the Glad Tidings of good
[40:39] things
[40:42] then we know that the preacher is
[40:44] depending on the Lord
[40:46] and here is our key and we said the
[40:48] prophet is the eye to the age you're all
[40:50] familiar with the scripture Revelation
[40:51] 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the
[40:55] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[40:58] sound the mystery of God
[41:01] the spiritual vision of God
[41:03] the spiritual things of God should be
[41:06] finished as he has declared to his
[41:08] servant the prophet
[41:10] how many of you know the other song I
[41:13] can't even walk
[41:15] without you holding my hand
[41:18] the Mountain's too high and The Valleys
[41:22] too wide and down on my knees
[41:25] I've learned to stand I can't even walk
[41:30] without you holding my hair amen
[41:37] amen I'm gonna try and bring this to a
[41:40] close now
[41:43] your attitude
[41:45] will determine the vision for your life
[41:51] your attitude towards God and the things
[41:54] of God will determine how spiritually
[41:57] successful you are in him
[42:00] right now and for the rest of 2023 and
[42:03] for the rest of the time that the Lord
[42:05] is here for the Gentile dispensation
[42:08] I'll say it again we are in the closing
[42:10] scenes of the Gentile dispensation
[42:12] when you're reading Acts chapter 2 it's
[42:15] the start it's the alpha age of the Holy
[42:18] Ghost Ministry we are living now in 2023
[42:20] it's the closing scenes of the Holy
[42:22] Ghost Ministry to the Gentiles amen
[42:26] your attitude will determine the type of
[42:28] year it's going to be for you
[42:31] if you're full of faith and positive
[42:35] I'm going to tell you you're going to
[42:36] have a supernatural here
[42:40] amen it's impossible for you not to have
[42:42] a supernatural here if you're full of
[42:44] faith
[42:47] [Music]
[42:49] not only are you going to have a
[42:50] supernatural here
[42:52] the year is going to be full of
[42:53] Supernatural experiences amen
[42:57] we believe the angel of God is here yes
[43:00] the angel of God is a supernatural being
[43:02] then we must have Supernatural
[43:04] experiences amen
[43:08] allow the Holy Ghost to lead us and
[43:10] guide us into all truth because that's
[43:13] what the Holy Ghost was sent for yes
[43:15] amen my advice to you never make
[43:18] decisions that go against the word of
[43:19] God
[43:22] rather take the word of God over
[43:24] everything
[43:25] if it's contrary to the word of God
[43:27] leave it alone
[43:29] God is compromising and weak faith
[43:34] reasoning weakens the faith of a
[43:36] believer
[43:38] and can never bring the promise of God
[43:41] to pass in your life
[43:43] now we know that Satan thrives in
[43:45] reasoning in doubt
[43:50] don't let Satan deposit re
[43:55] EF amen so faith is a positive
[43:57] confession hold that confession before
[43:59] the Lord amen hold it as if you are
[44:02] holding his sign
[44:03] of your belief that God is more than
[44:06] able to bring it to pass
[44:08] amen
[44:13] the prophet says today
[44:15] you might pick this up brother amen in
[44:17] the message inspiration
[44:20] don't we all need some inspiration you
[44:22] know what the prophet is saying in the
[44:24] message inspiration
[44:26] page 28th of January 1956 he says today
[44:30] the reason we're having such times as we
[44:33] are is because there's too much halfway
[44:36] conversations
[44:39] intellectual conversation
[44:42] there is two different elements in the
[44:44] human body that has a mind and one of
[44:47] them or reasoning one of them the
[44:49] reasoning is the mind which is
[44:50] intellectual the other is the soul which
[44:53] does not reason but believes the word of
[44:55] God
[44:58] he says you know some time ago
[45:01] fans laughed at the
[45:03] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[45:08] he said they said the Bible's all mixed
[45:10] up because man there's no mental
[45:12] faculties in the heart to think with but
[45:14] last year science proved that God was
[45:16] right they found right down in the heart
[45:19] of a man not in an animal but in a man
[45:21] there's a little compartment where even
[45:24] the blood cell doesn't even exist
[45:26] and they say it's the occupant of the
[45:29] soul that man by his soul lives there
[45:34] oh
[45:36] amen paragraph 23 he says now each of
[45:40] you have had experiences today think
[45:42] to say it can't happen
[45:45] now what is this he's saying people are
[45:48] going to come to you and tell you that
[45:49] it can't be
[45:51] whatever you're believing the Lord for
[45:52] it can't be it's not going to come to
[45:54] pass he's saying each of you about
[45:56] experiences where somebody say it can't
[45:59] happen it won't be but something right
[46:01] down in your soul that tells you it's
[46:03] going to be amen amen yes it doesn't
[46:07] make any difference what anybody says
[46:09] around unreasonable it seems to be you
[46:12] seem to know that it's going to be that
[46:14] way
[46:15] I mean
[46:17] if you're first in the law for that job
[46:19] is going to give it to you if you can
[46:20] believe your heart
[46:22] no matter the odds are stacked up
[46:24] against you you are going to receive it
[46:28] it's because your soul has testified and
[46:31] reasonings has been cast down as the
[46:33] Bible said it should now
[46:35] we said attitude right we can go into
[46:37] that quite a bit your attitude you know
[46:40] the saying your attitude will determine
[46:41] your altitude our you can go with God
[46:45] so attitude think on that I don't have
[46:47] time to elaborate the next thing
[46:48] influence
[46:51] yeah
[46:52] watch who we allow to influence us going
[46:55] forward yeah
[46:57] From This Moment On never allow negative
[47:00] people to influence you
[47:03] get away from negative people
[47:07] it's always about a negative thought
[47:09] negative idea casting the negative
[47:12] influence on you now it's easy to say
[47:14] customary negative people right but
[47:16] follow my thought if the mother and
[47:18] father is negative it's hard right
[47:21] especially if you're the sun because you
[47:22] don't really want to admit that your
[47:23] father is negative all the time and your
[47:26] mother is negative and always
[47:27] criticizing people and bringing them
[47:29] down am I talking sense reality
[47:33] but can we self-evaluate and say am I
[47:37] surrounded by negative people
[47:41] because you're fine
[47:44] it means lead that way to fall right and
[47:47] you know what they say
[47:49] something about nothing not falling far
[47:51] from the tree the Apple doesn't fall far
[47:53] from the tree if you are surrounded by a
[47:55] negative environment you're always
[47:57] hearing your father and your mother talk
[47:59] negative
[48:00] what kind of fruit do you think you're
[48:02] going to produce
[48:03] full of faith and positive you know what
[48:06] you're going to do you're also going to
[48:07] speak negative
[48:08] because that's the influence
[48:11] but
[48:12] why I brought it down to the home that's
[48:14] the most influential area of your life
[48:16] you spend the most time there now we can
[48:19] take you to the workplace we can take
[48:20] you to your school you can take you to
[48:22] your college don't allow me I'm
[48:24] summarizing and saying don't allow
[48:25] negative people to influence you right
[48:27] amen don't allow the world to influence
[48:29] you
[48:30] and I'm talking when I'm saying the
[48:32] world it can be extend to family whether
[48:34] the Christian denominational people
[48:35] don't allow them to influence you their
[48:38] standards are not missing standards
[48:39] their ways are not our ways neither are
[48:42] their ways God's ways
[48:49] amen
[48:53] okay I don't want to elaborate too much
[48:55] of that now
[49:00] don't we said one thing don't allow
[49:03] people to influence you right
[49:09] but don't allow
[49:11] I'm trying to retake it a little deeper
[49:14] now sometimes you get into relationships
[49:16] with people
[49:19] where you can get influenced
[49:23] because as young people growing up
[49:26] it's common it's natural for you to be
[49:29] attracted towards a girl
[49:31] and a girl towards a boy that's the only
[49:33] way we have it here
[49:37] a girl towards a boy and a boy towards a
[49:40] girl
[49:41] right
[49:44] we don't believe boys like boys and
[49:47] girls like girls
[49:50] we don't believe that I've got to say
[49:52] because they're teaching the schools
[49:54] things
[49:55] these I mean the children in schools
[49:57] these days that it's okay for boys to
[49:59] like boys it's okay for girls to like
[50:02] girls it's not okay amen you will tell
[50:05] your teacher I said that
[50:07] bring me to the principal's office
[50:12] amen
[50:14] if we do not influence our children they
[50:16] are teaching it in schools
[50:18] gender-neutral things
[50:22] you might meet a young lady this year
[50:25] and you can what am I trying to say let
[50:27] me summarize what I'm trying to say you
[50:29] are going to meet people where you're
[50:30] going to allow your heart to become
[50:32] involved
[50:34] and once matters of the heart are
[50:36] involved it's difficult
[50:38] so what am I saying guard your heart is
[50:40] here amen
[50:43] amen
[50:44] you may be praying Lord I need to meet
[50:46] the right woman I need to be meet the
[50:48] right man
[50:50] amen you may make people lose your
[50:52] friend at work people at school always
[50:54] remember you are a Christian and what
[50:56] you stand for when it comes to the word
[50:58] of God
[51:00] when it comes to the matters of the
[51:01] heart God your heart and do not allow
[51:04] yourself to get into a situation where
[51:06] you forsake the word of the Lord to
[51:08] settle for an unbeliever
[51:12] not going to elaborate this because
[51:15] you young men need to stop it if you are
[51:18] not of the age to get married stop
[51:20] flirting with that girl
[51:23] um
[51:26] you must be of the right age
[51:29] you might be able to say well I don't
[51:31] believe in casual dating
[51:34] amen amen don't be chatting up girls
[51:38] don't be chatting our boys for the sake
[51:40] of it
[51:43] if you are not able and ready to get
[51:45] married stop it
[51:47] focus on other things in your life you
[51:50] say focus on what how about get a job
[51:53] foreign
[52:03] how are you going to take care of your
[52:05] family
[52:07] how are you going to take care of the
[52:08] wife
[52:11] amen ready to get married meaning you
[52:13] are mature
[52:15] you're a man
[52:16] you have a job
[52:18] you can take care of the household take
[52:21] out the responsibilities of having a
[52:22] wife being a provider and also being the
[52:25] most importantly being the spiritual
[52:27] leader of home
[52:28] amen all the time women get into
[52:31] marriages and they find out there's many
[52:32] soon non-spiritual
[52:36] they think he went in the room to pray
[52:38] meanwhile they go there and he's playing
[52:39] TV games
[52:41] hey
[52:49] so
[52:50] guard your heart
[52:52] because I'm saying that because it's
[52:54] difficult when you get entangled
[52:57] and you fall so in love with that person
[53:00] and now your heart dictates to you more
[53:03] than the word of God
[53:04] so watch the relationships that we get
[53:07] involved with in all areas I have to
[53:11] close now and I want you all now to go
[53:13] out of this meeting
[53:15] believing that all things are possible
[53:21] I say you will neither be Barren nor
[53:23] unfruitful
[53:26] and your fruit will remain
[53:28] if you abide in the word of God
[53:32] amen you're free to remain your vision
[53:35] will be focused and specific your vision
[53:38] will influence others now you're not
[53:41] just influenced by others your vision
[53:43] will influence others
[53:45] amen
[53:47] and we must share the gospel this year
[53:50] who's with me
[53:53] we must share the gospel and tell
[53:56] everyone we come in contact with what
[53:58] the Lord Jesus is doing in this time and
[54:00] in this season
[54:04] we must be passionate about the gospel
[54:08] we cannot be casual
[54:11] we must not be casually in fact
[54:14] we must be sold out from the cause of
[54:16] the Gospel this year let us be a people
[54:19] with vision
[54:21] how many of you agree with me amen how
[54:24] many of you say Lord if I if I haven't
[54:25] given you my best in the last year or so
[54:27] you get I guarantee you if you were
[54:31] really in inspect your life you'll know
[54:33] if you're being going further towards
[54:35] God or you've been backsliding you know
[54:37] if you've been giving more to God or
[54:39] less to God
[54:40] and let's be honest people here this
[54:42] morning yes
[54:43] yes we want to step into the vision that
[54:46] God has for our lives be a people with
[54:48] vision then you'll understand what
[54:50] Revelation 10 11 says Thou must prophesy
[54:53] again amen I am so blessed I'm just
[54:56] reading what other apostles were acting
[54:58] in the book of Acts and I tell you they
[55:01] are so powerful men

[55:05] leading them and guiding them and you

[55:23] because now we have the fullness of the
[55:25] world
[55:26] and he's going to do it for us
