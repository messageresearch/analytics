those of you there one Sunday amen I'm sure you were blessed with the word amen when the word becomes a reality amen I mean if you know the word didn't just come to give us theology amen he came to equip us to make our sons and daughters put us back in the image of Christ amen amen that's why Jesus every time he spoke to the tree he said you're marveling at the tree you can speak to a mountain amen he came to tell us and you see the Apostle Paul writing that we are joint is with Jesus amen what's a joint here is it a 70 30 partnership what partnership 50 50 joint is amen so everything you've seen Jesus expressed as the God man the bride will now Express amen the feminine part of it amen that's the goal if you think of what the goal of the message is is to give us Rapture in faith rapturing faith lay in the messages amen and what what did he give us the key he says if you can't even have faith for your healing how are you going to have faith for Rapture so when it comes to healing and all of our needs in our lives amen we ought to take dominion over it amen amen there's nothing you can do to attain your healing Jesus daddy two thousand years ago it's finished at the cross he has lie sickness all people we need to attain something we need to work to it but it was all finished at the cross amen and I tell you when you come with that confidence that's where the Apostle Paul says now we enter boldly into his presence amen we have an eye priest hallelujah oh what a glow let's give the Lord a good answer he's a glorious father gave many many men oh hallelujah amen so we don't want to take much time we want to give much time to the world Amen just to let you know the power will drop at eight o'clock it might dip for a minute we're gonna go over to the generator amen so no problem you can continue preaching we're just going to take a minute to switch over to the generator amen hallelujah so we have Apostle Denzel here amen with some of his Believers I believe there's brother blessing from the Alice's church I remember the boys and his family here with Barnabas amen let's give our visitors a hand amen Hallelujah [Applause] dear Pastor Dan matanga amen and his dear wife let's give a hand hallelujah amen and you know there's something about a seasoned man of God yes amen someone who's balanced you the word amen I mean if you like to sit and listen to the wisdom of your elders amen amen that's the way we feel amen just sitting and listening to the brother preach amen because a time-tested memorial knows what he's talking about amen amen so if you pass me when I give you your the amen the Liberty to preach the word of the Lord amen as the holy spirit gives absence amen the one that was sent to lead and guide the church let's stand as we sing one song now and we hand over to our dear pastor glory be to his name amen there's something about the song that the prophet says the angel of the Lord just loved that song amen so let's leave us that old doubt all reasoning maybe you got a question in your mind let's lay down now and say Lord I believe your word amen comes out tonight through your servant even if I don't understand it Lord if it matches your Bible and your word I believe it Lord Jesus and I tell you if you can come now and approach and be reverent to the Holy Spirit of the Lord can move in this place let's sing now only [Music] [Music] all things are possible oh things things only believe [Music] me sing only believe [Music] oh [Music] things [Music] only believe that now let's make it personal and raise our hands and say Lord I believe Lord amen [Music] [Music] Lord I dearly God I clearly [Music] thank you Jesus exciting our dear precious and might of your father like thing to thank you tonight for guttering us up again amen the winners we believe that all things are possible yes we thank you Lord Jesus Christ of this place the elders and the whole change be able to cover up tonight for us that we can have fellowships yes yes we are so thankful to know that we really need that Fellowship yes oh God because it points us away unto you Angel are the author of Fellowship yes Lord Lord Jesus we remember the fellowship you had in the Garden of Eden they will add them before you fall yes Lord it was so sweet every evening you would come and fellowship with them Father God unite as we partake of this word once again may you come Lord go imagine speak to our hands and meet with each other in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen we can take our seats like to reach you tonight in the wonderful name to follow Jesus Christ amen like to thank the pasta here for opening up these doors and you can tell Fellowship I'd like to appreciate also part of the tensile for inviting me to Durban that we can come and be Hallelujah yes amen for that amen I believe we are gathered here for nothing else but the way amen hallelujah that is real and it is true and we know for sure as he Progress way into towards the rapture more and more days of men are over amen yes Lord takes up and he moves it on yes through these vessels amen you go back and see that going to the days of Moses and his ministry to start with it was a one-man band Ministry because as a prophet he was trying to demonstrate and to show something and when he moves of the sin you see that it no longer moves on as a one-man band Ministry yes but now you begin to see Joshua now in the rest of the people you know going around the walls of Jericho yes all those other people Everyone is involved amen and you see we have had a prophet who has come and gone he has played his role but he's given this message like the word says you know this this sign shall follow them amen now it's God now through the believer yes we're doing it and he said the signs shall follow them that day Hallelujah is is the signs that follow yes it's not as that man yes we are not sign Seekers but we we are followed by some amen actually it's not us being followed by the sign whenever the word is preached yes amen because it's it's the word the demonstration of his power absolutely amen you find that we have gathered around this message with this hour that's why you see the prophet it was it was Supernatural yes it was Supernatural you you cannot when once it's just the word it accomplishes amen it fulfills us but there is something that follows it yes there is something that follows it like you hear the talk about brother Branham says now when you will come for says maybe entering through the door there the back he says the moment he came in it looks like there is something that ended in with him something that came with that that was a company here now that's something that's beyond human yes that's something Beyond imagination yes it's something that's real amen something that comes out of that word that accompanied the preaching of that word and when it comes my brother my sister there is no doubt whatsoever that Anything Can Happen amen yes thank you that we are identified with such a message in this end time amen whereby is self-proclaiming itself manifesting amen that's what it is yes the touch of the supernatural accompanz it he says no no church can survive no individual can survive without that touch of the supernatural God in his word that things begin to manifest amen so we have such a great and a big message that we are so privileged to believe that we have nothing to fear we have everything to believe and it proclaims itself amen it proclaims itself through our lives proclaims himself through the preaching of the world and everything and everything now it moves from being a theoretical message but it goes to be a real message so you find that the message is not only Theory but the message is life amen practicality of Life absolutely so that's that's the highest distance now or the longest distance for the message to move from here right into the heart and then it moves into the heart it begins to produce a life and the lies is what is very very important amen Jesus was that small man was a man of few words but you know what really mattered uh in his life was a a is a life yes that's why whenever you would move around and talk around that life is what affected the people it was it was it was not so much of the words he said but the life that followed the few words or whatever he said is the life amen so we believe we are coming into that stage also or we are entering or we have ended that stage where the life of the message the life of the word is reproducing itself through the Believers amen do you believe that tonight now tonight I want to just preach a little short short message here Maybe where we look at uh Isaiah 53 verse 5. Isaiah 53 verse 5. and Mark 11 22-26. Hallelujah Isaacs uh Isaiah 53 5 reads but he was wounded for transgressions he was bruised for iniquities such as ties made of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are amen those stripes we are we are delivered whatever Ephesians 6 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but I give his principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places glory and Jesus entering Satan to them have faith in God Amen for very lie send to you the whole whosoever shall say unto this mountain whatsoever not the pastor not the preacher not the Deacon not the Elder only even the sister even the brother even young men whoever whosoever shall say now when the Bible say whosoever it means you can be placed right in there yes yes you say brother sorry and so if he shall say yes unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt is the heart but shall believe that those things which he saved shall come to pass you shall have whatsoever [Music] I want you to watch that scripture is concentrating on whosoever yeah and he shall whatever he shall say it shall come to pass amen it's you you you you you so the ministry is condescending being God from being the prophets from being the preachers it comes down to the you yes the aim to this one if you shall pray Hallelujah and believe what you say yes pray for amen thank you Lord and you shall say Amen it shall be grounded so it's no longer what the pastor shall say yes it's no longer what the Elder shall say but if you shall say Amen you are the whosoever thank you Lord I can't get him where is he whosoever shall say amen and the ministry has moved through all times and through all stages and so it's now playing around the mouth this dangerous member yeah which can be a blessing and can be really bring Terrible Things yes that's where that's where it is playing around there if you shall Say Amen you cannot say without a mouth without a tongue if you shall say yes it's you to say it so it's come down to you amen amen you cannot blame anyone else amen God blessings thank you Lord amen verse 24 therefore I say unto you one thing so ever you desire when you this is just you yes you you you you when you whatever you desire When you pray believe that you listen and you shall have them so where do I come in as a preacher yes yes Amen in other words it down to the responsibilities upon you so as preachers we are coming to equip you amen with what you are supposed to know man what you are supposed to believe what God is supposed to do through you it's you you you you absolutely it's you the issue is with you yeah if you shall say whatever things you desire yes When you pray you receive them and you shall have them amen that's for that brother that's what that brother that so that brother that's what that sister that sister and we come together with such a revelation and understanding the whole church will be on fire Hallelujah you are saying you are believing yes it's happening that one is saying it's believing and is happening so when you get together brother there is trouble for the devil Hallelujah do you believe that my brother my sister I want to title this message I pick it up from a message that the prophet preached now I want to title this message there is a spirit hanging over you yes have you ever wondered you come to church the word is grish you believe it you say as soon as I move on to this church all things are over now it's okay no more but you are back home you are taking the rat yes next service you're coming but Lord but why but why but why but why so as the prophet says the duty of the ministers he says is to cut the links amen with you of that Spirit yes that you are free yeah yeah then you are able to receive what is yours amen glory that's why we don't receive because there is something offering and hanging over us amen but the preacher man's duties he comes is cutting the limbs yeah he is he is evicting that enemy until you are free to be able to receive no with your thoughts it's already done amen hallelujah why can't you have it the person was caught in here it's in one of my quotations he says now we're not saved to the day we can yes we're not served we were not saved maybe the day we we had the message amen it's two thousand years ago glorious amen but we believed maybe two years ago or five years ago or ten years ago that's when we believed it but we were saved amen so he says by my stripes are you healed you were already healed but it's waiting for you to believe it the Holy Ghost is rightfully there for you but it's waiting for you to believe it and reach out and receive it amen amen your deliverance was paid down forth absolutely it's already yours amen but he's waiting for you to believe amen amen it's like when you came in the message I believe the message without yeah your friends could not believe you that are you you know you you're a drunkard we know you will go for drugs together you say but I'm now a Believer amen they were doubting you and when you continue to confess it I believe it oh yes we can see now that brother that that guy is now a Believer it's when you study to believe but otherwise it's already done for you amen so we see right there will wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of darkness in this world against spiritual wickedness in high places yes brother we are wrestling you know what the wrestler is it's a battle amen it's a fight yes of whoever is going to win it then he takes a a higher post amen over the world who has lost the battle so ours is a battle yes it's a lesson amen if you've ever watch some wrestling what they do those guys are serious yes if it gets you put you under his armpit he begins to hit you it begins to harm you if he takes you down he begins to just give you a hard time yes yes so it's a question of who wins over the other yes and that's the war with the devil it's a terrible War my brother yes you're not just going to receive it on a platter every day of your life you are fighting amen is a wrestling against Power amen a wrestling against principalities arresting aggressive amen this world is cruel so full of demonic power amen and many times they don't know yeah what is happening around us the enemy wants to destroy us wants to pull us down amen but we say my brother we are more than able to possess the country from the children and to the Sea Satan no matter what you do we are telling you tonight we are coming for you we are more than conquerors and we have Victors with Jesus because he says that we are more than evil it is finished amen the devil is fighting a losing battle amen it's just a delayed match amen you know what it is over amen so I'm happy to cut that here with the Victor if you just wave your head tonight oh Satan can you see those hands you are so in serious trouble because the hands are defined you those ends are telling you we are more than conquerors we are more than able yes amen amen thank you so you see right there my brother my sister uh he was wounded for transgressions he was Bruce for inhibited yes Glory that just tells me before peace was upon him with his stripes we are amen those tribes but today we are healed amen so the provision is already there amen all that you ever desire all that you ever need is already undertaken for me it was paid down far it's like Mama is prepared a meal a nice meal our dear brother jensu displays so she prepares nice breakfast some little Tomatoes there whatever some little vegetables some sandwiches there brother she plays it on the table so the problem is not sister Denzel the problem is you brother them who cannot eat food can be prepared yeah but you've got to be able to have the appetite to wash your hands to say this is for me at whatever course I will reach out for the food Amen in order to survive but there's so many in this day the seven cosmio is right before them but they don't dare stress their hand they don't dare wash their hands they are crying babies all their life they are crying oh Lord Oh Lord but Lord but Lord your Christ but there is a temple spread before you my brother pray for you to to just fix the time amen you have no reason to cry yes you have no reason to complain in manner you have every reason to say thank you Lord for what you've done for us brother Lord you are not here my brother my sister but he knew you from before the foundation of the world he chose Zero by his predestinative will by his foreign [Music] yes you are today in this church raising your hand believing the message but it's already done it was only a delayed merger we are here because we are supposed to be here we are saying amen because we are supposed to say we were saved from before there saying amen Hallelujah thank you Jesus amen amen so we sit right there why can't we be healed yeah why can't we be set free why can't we live our old habits why can't we live marijuana all those drugs why can't you leave that beer drinking there is a spirit hanging over you which can't let you loose but tonight my brother we are coming against the spirit and cut off all his legs that you are free to receive your freedom free to receive whatever has desire you have now he says right there in Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God yes amen for very I say that whosoever shall say unto this mountain brother is not like a natural mountain is the mountain of your problem if you shall say to your Mountain amen your situation yes which according to is so high it's so big a problem you can't get under it you can't get over it you can't get around it you don't know what to do but if you say to that mountain if you stick to that mountain if you address your Mountain I said it's not going to address it for you you've got to speak

speak to your condition oh there was no squirrels in the bush yes and the vegetation was not for skills in the world that could not allow spirits to be there and close by to a farmers with their equipment making a lot of noise so they were prohibited factors yeah to be there but when God comes he bypasses all procedures Hallelujah he bypasses all circumstances he bypasses all situations like Sarah who was so old Beyond menopause she could not have a child but when the god of Abraham come he bypass all procedures there was an age sector at that age you could not be able to have a chance but when God came he bypassed that procedure he bypassed that Center and tonight my brother you might help be having the nurse that the doctor wrote that this disease will take your life but tonight what am I saying God is going to bypass all the procedures maybe you're up for an operation but I tell you there is a possibility that before that Operation God will have carried out a supernatural operation and by the time you go there they will tell you we cannot we cannot identify where the cyst is no longer there where has it gone to God bypassing procedure [Applause] Christ when there was no wine because now the wine is finished and he says bring some water and right there he took that water and when he took that water he placed that water and that water literally became wine yes he says Jesus bypassed all procedures he was supposed to have grapes and from grapes then you have water and then you but he just piped us all the procedures and water was taken to wine and one time he just took from maybe one piece of bread and you broke it broke it broke it broke it broke it yeah it was in the process from wheat yeah for you to end up with bread amen but it just kept on breaking man and summer what was breaking never got finished yeah but he was multiplying it brother he was bypassing procedure and tonight also pop can bypass procedure Hallelujah man you want to get married but you look around the church there is no one to marry you you look around the churches there is no one to marry you and my brother my sister you wonder who is going to marry me but God can bypass procedure from nowhere God can bring somebody Glory some 15 20 years ago I was preaching in another country called Holland Netherlands then I didn't know what was happening and then there was a sister at the back there she is the operator she was operating the sound system I didn't even know she was a medical doctor I said oh maybe sister you might you are very worried you don't know where your husband will come will come from but I tell you don't know by believing the word after this Silence of after this sermon maybe some brother from some country will come and approach the person they don't want to marry this sister brother when we left it we went the pastor full to say you know what it didn't take a few months somebody came from Germany he says I want to marry this sister oh my brother [Applause] I pass this procedure [Applause] procedure let them stop process amen procedure makes it impossible procedure makes it costly but when God bypasses procedure my brother he becomes reasonably Hallelujah yes where you were supposed to pray for an operation fourteen thousand then you pay nothing my brother you just say amen and something begins to move on my brother my sister yeah so you see right there whosoever shall say and no doubt he lost he and believes it believe those things that they shall you have to believe that those things shall be amen amen they shall come to pass you have to believe amen you have to confess that you have to say that so that the high priest will take your confession and make it right before God Amen but for men of us God has nothing to confess because we always memoring we are always complaining but we have something positive to take before the high priest amen amen amen so whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you will receive them and you shall have them all amen now he says in this message but when you get that little grain of seed turned on it it's not like the rock of Gibbler it's like the Rock of Ages standing there and you feel the sound of abundance of rain yes you are God's child Satan has put that Affliction upon you and you know what and Christ has already healed every one of you amen Christ has already healed every one of you yes you still feel the pain but by my size are you here amen get it believe it testify about it testify amen say it amen amen amen that's right yes look at what your son is saying yes there's still something that is defying the odds he is believing the promise no matter how rough it becomes no matter how difficult it becomes never give up my brother never give up my sister better things are coming Hallelujah your blessing is on the way thank you Lord thank you Lord you've been praying for your mother for so long A Time praying for your father for so long in time praying for your daughter for soul and your time to receive this message that day is coming amen amen each time you come to church yes yes you just say now someday she will be seated right yeah someday right here all my brothers through that's true my brother that's true my brother that's true my brother your confession which the high priest takes to God Amen he will make it come to pass Glory so he says Satan is good that Affliction upon you now I'm going to my message says a sinner come to the old time say brother brother yeah I want you to pray for me I want to be good I want to be saved I want to be good but I just you pray for me and go back in your sins and he says this boy would come all the time like those people maybe say today whoever want to receive Christ as their personal savior they come tomorrow Tomorrow there's another altar God those who want to give their lives to Jesus is for the first time they come yeah yes they give their lives yeah today they are giving their lives yes tomorrow they give their life they spend one 365 in Dakota days giving their lives when are they going to ever give their lives to the Lord yes and say I have given my life over to the Lord yes when are they ever going to say that amenities this is next night see how many wants to be saved here he stands up that that's that's that that boy he stands up you want to be saved young man he says yes sir that's another night yes well why don't you get saved the boy says I don't know those who want to receive the Holy Ghost why can't you receive the Holy Spirit today I am sick tomorrow those who are sick days up next year the head is up five years why can't you be healed I have an answer for you tonight amen are we together amen well why don't you get served I don't know yet the scripture says he was wounded yes for our transgressions he was bruised for iniquities that she entitlement of his peace upon us and with his tribes we are healed already now let me just keep this he goes on to say the devil was holding that boy amen are we together the reason why he comes every time I want this I want this for years I want this is the devil holding that boy amen he says that's all he wants to do right but there is a spirit a power that won't let him be right Hallelujah there is a spirit a power that won't let it be right but sometimes somebody has got his own things which he cannot let use no matter how much the word is preached it's a spirit it's a power that holds him down he cannot be let loose it takes the preachers to come and they preacher and they are cutting all the links then he can be able to receive his Deliverance you take that my brother my sister he is a slave to smoking he doesn't want to smoke anymore he comes church he says now I I won't smoke but by the time he comes to the he comes the next service again he's tempted to smoke yes there is a spirit there is a power that's holding him hovering over him that won't let him receive his Deliverance but the preaching of the word casts out evil spirits it cuts off all the leaves that brothers and sisters can be able to receive whatsoever has desired Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you you don't want to shout at your wife yeah yeah you don't want to be mean to your wife you don't want to speak raft your wife you don't want to pull down your husband you don't like it you come to church the world is going on you say Lord yes I believe from today onwards help me you just go back home you're able to say sweetie sweetie honey just for that but tomorrow by the evening you bet yourself again that spirit is bother to you yes that preachers followed you all your life you don't know what to do until sometimes you're so tired you are so weary that what's the use of me going to church what's the use of me doing this and that but my brother I'm saying there is a spirit hanging over you but preacher us out there to preach the gospel and cut off all the things that you are able to receive your deliverance Hallelujah Hallelujah he says and God can save you God can save you because he has already done it the only thing you have to do is accept it it's already done I wasn't served 20 years ago I was saved 1900 years ago but 20 years ago I received it and accepted it yeah amen some receive it but they don't accept it this is I've received it I've received it every you received yes I've received but they've not accepted them now when you receive and accept what you have accepted becomes a part of you what you've accepted you move with it what if accepted you live with it but you have to believe it and you are accepted believing and accepting makes it a part of you nothing can no longer take it away from you yeah you see that correct amen so he says it's already done I wasn't saved 20 years ago I was saved 1900 if it hurt him the first sin I had done God would have wiped me off the face of the Earth because he said he would and he has to keep his promise I was a healed 1900 years ago but I've got to accept it amen you were healed 1900 years ago yes that's what he died for and he said it is finished and you have to accept it amen [Music] but as preachers of the world we are cutting off all the links and all the Avenues amen that don't want you to receive that that don't want you to accept that we say healing is yours the Holy Ghost is yours Deliverance is yours Joy is yours and the devil does not want you to accept it yes praise the Lord so there is a spirit that's hanging over you that keeps you from being set yes that keeps you from being healed that keeps you from uh no no being loose from that bite oh it's nice you come to church you hear the words and from now on what I want you to I don't want to talk about my sister I want to talk about my Lord help me there is a spirit hanging over you before you know it you're back to it again yes that Spirit of lying you say Lord I don't want to lie anymore but you're back again you start lying I don't want to cheat anymore you bet you start shooting again there is a spirit that's a hanging over you amen and the only thing says the prophets God kept me from being saved when I was 12 years of old of age because a spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little while longer that's procrastination yes you hear the word it speaks Your Heart You Feel Me Maybe maybe okay I will see the pastor next week maybe after three months I've got to sort this thing out brother that's a spirit it doesn't want you to be delivered amen you keep on lengthening it you keep on taking it further you see maybe I'll come again then maybe there there then I'll see what I can do brother there is a spirit hanging over you that's fighting you today is your day when you shall eat my brother don't lengthen the days you say Lord help me he goes on to say that's the reason he wasn't saved when you become the age of accountability yeah yeah he had already for you yes he goes and say a spirit you got in a crowd and that hovered over you and kept hanging over you do you know you can pick Spirits from crowds yes yes right right oh you know I just accommod my friend to the pub you know but I may believe I don't drink I actually had my why my friend and his friends were busy drinking right in there you're picking Spirits yes amen amen yes true why would you go to places where Christ is not welcome amen where Christ is not welcome I'm also not welcome you know I'm taking wine but you're associating that crowd and before you know it is you move from there you've picked up your spirit and that spirit will aim over you remember that woman with the demon of dancing where she picked it yes the moment she just went into a dance it came over here right in there my brother in that Spirit like a pet which was something like a demonia power amen and those things are bothering us and worrying us every day of our life and we say Lord we don't want this Spirit cut them off we want to receive our blessing from almighty God Hallelujah Paul one time went to a crowd but thank God he was a grouped crowd yes anyone's where he was from there he said his soul also among the prophets he had gotten to the prophets yeah and because he was among them he was anointed by spirit that was upon the prophet prophets anointed by the right Spirit by going to the right places by keeping companion with the right people then that anointing follows you in your life [Music] amen amen so this is my friend it's my friend but he's that friend of yours with all that he does with all the spirits that follow him

give them but when a son will come sometimes you do it but amen amen praise the Lord amen there was a church being dedicated some three 300 kilometers of 100 kilometers from our place so I was also called to go there and preach on the dedication day so we're there there were lots of people thousands yeah ministers we were over 100. so this is from another sister Church of ours she says I purpose I want to call them so for 10 years I didn't have a child but I say Lord I've asked nothing has happened I want to go there and the purpose why I'm going there is I want to have a baby yes social event to the meetings and then when he went right there I think after the first service we just went out some Minister standing there and then there was this sister who came she said pastor I just felt something that will come just greet you shake your hands something in the story she said I've had quite some time without a child I felt maybe the Lord would just do something I said let's pray

day again the meaning separate I said but Lord you are not addressing my issue then this final day then that's dedication okay so we're preaching so I began to witness and say yesterday there's a sister who came with this as I said listen receive whatever it is right here if there's somebody writing that same condition upon that testimony receive your baby and the sister says I was in there I said Lord I have received it's done with him he's finished then I went to their place I think I didn't I didn't know I would meet them there and then the parts of the places Pastor can you just pray for this sister and her husband because they haven't had a child so and then the sister was saying I just agreed towards my pastor say because my husband was not there but as for me I already received yes amen and I just did it for my husband then I think it was was a week or the following week or the other week she phoned to say we went to the gynecologist and the gynecologist I told them it's

promise that baby will come regardless amen that you take it out a little early put the little baby in the ICU I said brother sister don't you worry this baby will leave amen and then one morning's phone said the baby cannot suck her you know this is the doctors they were sitting here from this with all the doctors are saying no but it's high time it's a circle I said when you get there let's just pray over I said no they don't allow for cell phones they say let me pray with you and when you go in there I believe something will happen so she said after prayer I went in there he says I went

and so on so on and she saw that thing followed me all right she was reading a book which was written by one man who was where it is kept from Satanism and this man I think was saying this was saying sometimes even now we how he got the preachers would go to them so now you preacher you have saved God look at the working of that look at your church look at even other Ministries that have come out of you the sister groups you really just look your children are grown up now now I mean you can just rest now he says it's us with Spirits trying to convince him yet his time is not yet and then the preacher will say oh yes I think I'll look at what I've done I think now I must invest he's sending you to a premature grave suddenly saying that that man had repented from Satanism he says that's what we used to do to do to get at the preachers persuade them and then he strikes with the disease we're gonna say oh Lord yes you can take me home take me away where I want to come do you want to go
