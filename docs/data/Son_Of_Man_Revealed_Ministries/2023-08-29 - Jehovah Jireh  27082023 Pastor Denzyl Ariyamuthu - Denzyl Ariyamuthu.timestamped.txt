[2:40] him much Thanksgiving amen amen
[2:43] greetings you brothers and sisters and a
[2:45] wonderful name of our Lord and our
[2:47] Savior Jesus Christ while we're standing
[2:49] together
[2:50] Colossians chapter one
[2:53] we're going to read from verse 12.
[3:02] Colossians 1 from verse 12.
[3:07] it says giving thanks unto the Father
[3:08] which had made us me to be partakers of
[3:11] the inheritance of the Saints in light
[3:14] who had delivered us from the power of
[3:16] darkness and translated us into the
[3:18] kingdom of his dear son in whom we have
[3:20] Redemption through his blood even the
[3:23] Forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[3:25] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[3:28] creature for by him were all things
[3:29] created that are in heaven and that are
[3:32] in Earth visible and invisible whether
[3:34] they be Thrones or dominions or
[3:36] principalities or Powers all things were
[3:39] created by Him and for him and he is
[3:42] before all things and by him all things
[3:44] consist and he is the head of the body
[3:47] the church who is the beginning the
[3:49] firstborn from the dead that in all
[3:51] things he might have preeminence we're
[3:54] going to turn to John 1 1.
[4:00] um very familiar scripture also John 1 1
[4:04] it says
[4:05] in the beginning was the word and the
[4:08] Word was with God and the Word was God
[4:11] you may take your seats this morning
[4:14] for a title we're going to title the
[4:16] sermon provision in the word
[4:20] amen and so we are happy that we could I
[4:22] mean fellowship with you this morning
[4:24] and I'm thankful to you Pastor Adrian
[4:26] for the invitation to minister
[4:29] and uh it's a good friend of mine also
[4:32] and we appreciate the friendship and
[4:35] love and appreciate you all very much so
[4:38] we are glad that we could be here yeah
[4:40] with my family also this morning
[4:41] normally they don't like to travel with
[4:44] me but they for some reason they wanted
[4:46] to come today I don't know why
[4:49] but they wanted to come so they are here
[4:51] this morning
[4:52] and so
[4:53] um I trust the things that we'll share
[4:55] will just be a blessing amen and uh at
[4:58] the Holy Ghost can take control
[5:00] we can put down our notes and we can
[5:03] have our thoughts about what we think uh
[5:06] could be a blessing but unless he comes
[5:09] and does something and so that's what we
[5:11] have expectation is this morning he said
[5:13] the Lord will come down and come in uh
[5:16] Minister and remember there was a pastor
[5:18] that told me one time he had his son
[5:20] preach for the first time
[5:22] and after you started Bridge he said Dad
[5:26] how did they do he said look you had
[5:27] Nice Notes you had nice points but there
[5:29] was no anointing okay so next time pray
[5:31] for the anointing when you're preaching
[5:33] and so I always pray for that Lord I
[5:35] said Lord when we have our notes
[5:37] prepared and uh please send an anointing
[5:40] also at the word that's being preached
[5:42] will come in anointing the people will
[5:43] be anointed to receive the word as well
[5:45] so I trust this morning it'll be the
[5:47] same that it'll be an anointing that
[5:50] comes with the preaching and from the
[5:52] from the congregation together we'll
[5:53] pull on the word we'll pull on each
[5:55] other and we'll have a blessed time this
[5:58] morning
[5:59] it's important to raise uh raise up out
[6:02] of this Earthly place of Leo this year
[6:05] and it's a it's a tug of war that we are
[6:08] in Daily we're fighting this battle we
[6:10] are we're living in two dimensions in
[6:13] this laodicean uh Dimension and also in
[6:16] the bride the bright age the bright
[6:18] Dimension like brother Venom says and so
[6:20] we have to live in the Supernatural and
[6:23] we're going to be living in Two Worlds
[6:25] at the same time but the bride you must
[6:27] remember is called up higher and we are
[6:30] called up into an Open Door age
[6:33] and the problem says that open door the
[6:35] door is Christ the open door is revealed
[6:38] Christ in this day so it's a revealed
[6:41] Christ that we would gather around the
[6:43] Bride of Jesus Christ and like the
[6:45] scripture says where the carcass is the
[6:47] eagles they gather themselves together
[6:49] and so we gather to hear the word
[6:51] brothers and sisters we always gather to
[6:54] hear the word the word which is the
[6:56] logos the word which prevents says the
[6:58] logos is the anointing or the anointed
[7:01] ones that's where we gather
[7:04] and so the word is preached
[7:08] um there's anointing of the logos and
[7:10] there's always a power that goes forth
[7:12] when the word is preached and the
[7:14] Believers have to believe that when you
[7:17] come to the fellowship and the word is
[7:18] being preached you have to believe that
[7:20] there's a power that goes forth when the
[7:22] word is preached it's not it's not about
[7:24] who is standing behind the pulpit and
[7:26] preaching it's about the word all the
[7:28] time when the word Goes Forth there's a
[7:30] power that goes with the word
[7:32] and so like the prophet says he speaks
[7:35] about creation he says the word of God
[7:38] went forth he said the word of God went
[7:41] forth and he said let there be light he
[7:44] said and then the light followed he said
[7:46] why because his word has a creative
[7:48] power all the time
[7:50] now he's the word is not a limited
[7:53] brothers and sisters and you have to
[7:55] remember that the word is the same
[7:57] yesterday today and forever the word the
[8:00] the nature and the character the
[8:01] attributes of the word won't change so
[8:04] if the word that when fought in the
[8:06] beginning said let there be light and
[8:08] there was a creative power in the world
[8:10] and light followed when the world is
[8:12] preached again now it will have the same
[8:14] creative power
[8:16] it has to follow that word button
[8:18] sisters because it's not unless it's the
[8:20] word of a man if it's the word of a man
[8:22] then it will fail hopelessly but if it's
[8:25] the same word of the Lord then when it
[8:27] goes part it will do the same things
[8:29] it'll have a greater power and what it
[8:32] says will follow when it is shed
[8:37] so uh that's the way God does it and uh
[8:41] he sends his word uh prabham says he
[8:44] sends his word for this hour and the
[8:46] Holy Spirit comes and he makes that word
[8:48] live
[8:50] the prophet speaks about the creative
[8:52] power he calls the creative power the
[8:54] power of faith
[8:56] means that every single one of us can
[8:59] have the creative power it's called The
[9:01] Power of Faith he says when two
[9:03] omnipotents come together he says to
[9:06] Omni faiths come together he says
[9:08] something he's got to shake
[9:10] whatever you say with that creative
[9:12] power of the omnipotent God Prophet says
[9:16] it creates a power and it goes forth
[9:19] Yonder and it brings it to pass what you
[9:22] say
[9:23] two omnipotence
[9:26] I want to read a culture work works is
[9:29] the faith Express 65 11 26 paragraph 151
[9:35] just to lay lay a few things and as we
[9:37] get into what we're going to say
[9:46] when that word went forth now it becomes
[9:50] a seed
[9:51] amen it has to fall somewhere
[9:54] the word has to fall somewhere
[9:56] and if God said it there's bound to be a
[10:00] womb somewhere for it to fall into
[10:03] just as he said all things are possible
[10:06] to them that believe if you say to this
[10:09] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[10:11] your heart you can have what you said
[10:14] you see there's got to be somewhere
[10:17] that's right
[10:18] unquote
[10:20] so the word is a seed
[10:22] and there must be a womb somewhere here
[10:26] this morning
[10:27] somewhere here this morning that will
[10:30] receive the word when it is preached
[10:33] and when it is received in the right
[10:35] whom it will materialize to that
[10:37] individual
[10:39] you understand Francis when the world is
[10:42] God goes forward there has to be a room
[10:45] to receive that word because the word is
[10:47] a seed
[10:48] that's going to fall on a home and when
[10:50] it's received in their right womb with
[10:52] the right kind of Faith it's got to
[10:54] materialize to that individual
[10:59] says when the angel came to Mary
[11:02] the prophet says she was thinking about
[11:05] the scripture in Isaiah
[11:07] says that a mind was on that word mind
[11:11] was on that scripture and uh the prophet
[11:14] drama times dramatizes it it says Mary
[11:17] and Joseph had been to the synagogue
[11:19] that morning and the priest was speaking
[11:22] about the book of Isaiah a virgin shall
[11:24] conceive and so when she when they come
[11:27] home they've been talking about that
[11:28] scripture of Isaiah 7 14 a virgin shall
[11:32] conceive and a mind was on that
[11:33] scripture
[11:35] yes beholding virgin shall conceive
[11:37] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[11:39] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[11:42] conceive Isaiah 7 14. amen and so she
[11:46] heard the word being preached and she
[11:48] was pondering on that word means that
[11:51] after the word was preached in the
[11:53] synagogue she went home and she stayed
[11:55] under the anointing of the word amen
[11:58] amen now I hope you I hope you can catch
[12:01] that this morning
[12:02] means that when you leave the door this
[12:05] morning you don't leave the word back in
[12:07] the church
[12:08] but the word must go with you and you
[12:11] must stay in the anointing of the word
[12:12] and your mind must be pondering on that
[12:15] word
[12:17] why because you want that word to
[12:19] materialize you want that word to
[12:21] manifest in your own life
[12:24] and so Mary when she left the synagogue
[12:27] she went with the word the word that the
[12:30] pre the priesthood preached she went
[12:32] with that word at home she's pondering
[12:34] about that word
[12:37] and then the angel came to Mary and
[12:39] spoke and the prophet says that mary
[12:43] caught the germ of the word a virgin
[12:46] shall conceived in her womb
[12:51] when the Angels spoke it she caught it
[12:54] and she held on to it and then she said
[12:57] be that unto me according to Thy word so
[13:00] she caught the germ of that word that
[13:02] scripture a virgin shall conceive
[13:05] and then it materialize in her body the
[13:09] word spoken by the angel started to
[13:12] create in the womb of Mary a body again
[13:16] you see the word and its creative power
[13:20] do we have Mary's here this morning
[13:23] that when the word is preached they're
[13:26] able to catch the germ of the word
[13:28] and say be that to me according to the
[13:31] word that is being preached that jam is
[13:35] life this morning
[13:37] he stayed under the anointing of the
[13:39] word when it was preached in that day
[13:42] like there was two women one time
[13:44] brother Branham speaks about the two
[13:46] women that come in the prayer line and
[13:48] they had been prayed for in the service
[13:51] he says one had a stomach problem and
[13:54] she could not eat anything she eats she
[13:56] would take out she was very sick and the
[13:59] other had a cancer in the face
[14:01] and the prophet says the boat had been
[14:03] prayed for and says the angel of the
[14:06] Lord announced their healing
[14:10] amen and um he said uh and and the
[14:13] prophet says now go home and receive
[14:15] your healing
[14:17] now you might
[14:19] you might look for a supernatural Angel
[14:22] this morning it'll be good if you see it
[14:26] but the prophet says the angel of the
[14:29] Lord is in this message
[14:32] I mean the very word that we preach is
[14:34] the Angel of the Lord the very word that
[14:37] we preach is God himself as the prophet
[14:40] says the angel of the Lord is in this
[14:41] message the angel of the Lord that's
[14:44] going to visit you is going to come to
[14:45] the word the preaching of the word the
[14:47] preaching of the Prophet sermons is the
[14:49] Angel of the Lord coming to you amen
[14:51] the Robin says the angel of the Lord is
[14:54] in this message
[14:56] and the message is the word of God which
[14:58] is God himself
[15:04] and so the angel of the Lord
[15:06] when the word goes sport
[15:08] the angel of the Lord he brings that
[15:11] word to us
[15:12] and he will also bring that word to pass
[15:17] because the word of the Lord will not
[15:18] return void
[15:20] and so Prophet says yeah these two women
[15:23] had went home after the angel of the
[15:25] Lord had pronounced their healing
[15:27] and he said it was six weeks that had
[15:29] gone by
[15:30] think of that because we want the
[15:33] miracle right now if we prayed for today
[15:35] it must happen now if it doesn't happen
[15:37] now or what it was not spiritual enough
[15:39] but maybe we are not spiritually now to
[15:42] wait upon the God's word because the
[15:44] prophet says yes six weeks had gone by
[15:47] and there was nothing
[15:49] and so after six weeks there was no
[15:51] healing and the lady with the stomach
[15:53] trouble she tried to eat every day the
[15:55] prophet said but with no joy
[15:59] but remember when the word goes forward
[16:01] it will not return void
[16:04] but accomplish what its purpose for the
[16:08] prophet says six weeks later one morning
[16:10] she felt something cool come over her
[16:13] and instantly the woman got healed
[16:17] and the problem that she ran to a
[16:19] neighbor that was in a prayer line with
[16:21] her the one with the cancer on the face
[16:24] and when she got to a house she heard
[16:26] her screaming and shouting and praising
[16:29] God and when she went inside she saw
[16:31] this woman dusting the bed trying to
[16:34] find that piece of cancer that fell off
[16:40] and the problem says the word had went
[16:43] forth in the meeting
[16:45] and the angel of the Lord stuck around
[16:48] the neighborhood all that time
[16:52] and after six weeks of sticking around
[16:54] in the neighborhood the angel of the
[16:56] Lord visited their home
[17:00] why because the word of the Lord it went
[17:02] forth it will not return void but it
[17:05] accomplished that which is purpose for
[17:07] the healing was pronounced and so the
[17:10] angel of the Lord was waiting in the
[17:12] area waiting in the neighbor to bring
[17:14] that word to pass
[17:21] you hold on to that gem if it doesn't
[17:24] happen day one day two week one week two
[17:26] but you still hold on to that jam
[17:28] because the angel of the Lord that gave
[17:30] that word over the pulpon will see to it
[17:33] that it is met
[17:39] so we are saying that when the word is
[17:41] preached the angel of the Lord in this
[17:43] message that's bringing this word will
[17:46] bring it to pass in our lives
[17:49] you gotta catch the gem of the word for
[17:51] in your spiritual home and you must hold
[17:54] on to it brothers and sisters because it
[17:57] has the power to create
[17:59] and the prophet says the power to create
[18:01] is called faith
[18:04] when you leave yeah you've got to stay
[18:07] in the Supernatural
[18:10] you got to stay in the Supernatural for
[18:12] it to come to pass
[18:13] you can't leave you and leave your
[18:15] blessing back in the house of the Lord
[18:17] you've got to go out go out and confess
[18:19] your healing go out there and confess
[18:22] your deliverance go out here and ponder
[18:24] about the word that have been preached
[18:27] unto the angel visits your neighborhood
[18:30] comes into your home and brings that
[18:32] word to pass in your life
[18:39] don't let go once you catch the gym
[18:42] but the man speaks about Daniel one time
[18:44] he said Daniel was praying for 21 days
[18:47] he says in the for 21 days his prayer
[18:50] never went to God
[18:51] he says because the kingdom the prince
[18:53] of the kingdom of Persia was opposing
[18:55] his prayer
[18:57] the angel could not get to Daniel when
[18:59] the angel came to Daniel he said for 21
[19:01] days I could not come to you but 21 days
[19:04] your prayer could not be answered
[19:05] because the Prince of Persia was
[19:07] opposing your prayer
[19:10] so what is the prophet saying that
[19:12] you've got to hold on to that faith
[19:14] you've got to wait if it's being opposed
[19:17] but the angel will break through for you
[19:20] once you Captain catch the jump but the
[19:23] man says once you catch a drum go out
[19:25] praising the Lord
[19:27] never have a negative testimony
[19:32] you love the Lord
[19:34] so
[19:35] this morning we're going to be touching
[19:37] on a few things and I trust that it will
[19:39] give us Grace
[19:42] um this morning I've been speaking on uh
[19:45] the Redemptive names of Jehovah on our
[19:48] Tuesday night services and I thought
[19:50] that this morning we would touch on
[19:52] Jehovah Jireh
[19:55] and what you the name Jehovah Jehovah
[19:59] means to exist
[20:02] ought to become known
[20:04] means to exist means he's the one that
[20:06] exists he's the ma is the one that
[20:09] always exists he is the I am
[20:13] he is the self-existing one he is Elohim
[20:17] Jehovah is Elohim the one that exists or
[20:20] the one that self-existed
[20:23] Jehovah means to become known means that
[20:27] he wants to make himself known
[20:29] this self-existing one Elohim the South
[20:33] existing one Jehovah that exists and in
[20:36] him is all the goodness in him his life
[20:39] he wants to make himself known or wants
[20:42] to reveal himself
[20:44] so in other words this great Jehovah who
[20:48] exists and wants to make himself known
[20:50] he has all of these Redemptive blessings
[20:53] in him all of this Redemptive nature and
[20:55] characters in him all of the Redemptive
[20:57] names in him and so he wants to make
[21:00] himself known he wants to make himself
[21:01] known as Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha and
[21:04] Jehovah Nissi so he wants to make
[21:06] himself known so Jehovah is the one that
[21:09] wants to make himself known amen
[21:12] but the prophet says
[21:15] that when he existed alone as Elohim he
[21:18] was too mysterious to be understood
[21:21] means that he could not reveal himself
[21:23] as Elohim
[21:26] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[21:27] 6307-28
[21:30] paragraph 21 141
[21:37] brother Adam says the first thing was
[21:40] that God wanted to reveal himself to the
[21:43] people
[21:44] 142 he says he couldn't do it as a as
[21:48] great Jehovah God who covered all
[21:51] space-time and Eternity Jehovah is the
[21:54] one that wants to reveal himself we said
[21:55] but he could not do it in that form
[21:58] so he could not he is too great to ever
[22:01] be revealed to people because it would
[22:04] be too mysterious
[22:05] how could that great being that never
[22:07] did begin then after you went beyond the
[22:10] cycle of hundreds of billions and
[22:12] trillions and trillions of years of
[22:14] light space and on out into the infinite
[22:17] into the eternity and a great creature
[22:19] that was that was all that and still is
[22:22] unquote
[22:26] is telling us that Jehovah God Elohim he
[22:31] is too mysterious to ever be understood
[22:33] or in that form that he existed he could
[22:37] not reveal himself he could not make
[22:38] himself known yet Jehovah means the one
[22:41] that wants to make himself known
[22:46] so he will make himself known we know
[22:49] and he will Express different attributes
[22:51] Express the different Redemptive names
[22:55] Jehovah Jireh
[22:57] uh Jehovah I find the different names
[22:59] but this morning we're going to speak on
[23:01] Jehovah Jireh
[23:03] and Jireh means
[23:05] he that sees
[23:08] oh Jara means
[23:11] cease to it
[23:13] all it means makes a provision
[23:16] in other words
[23:18] uh jarrah means the one that sees
[23:22] he sees to it and he makes a provision
[23:24] for it
[23:26] Jehovah existed alone
[23:28] and he wanted to make himself known as
[23:31] jira
[23:33] the one that sees and how does he see
[23:36] him says he sees by foreknowledge
[23:40] nothing happens without him knowing
[23:42] about it first
[23:44] Jehovah knows the beginning until the
[23:48] end
[23:49] he saw the fall of Man
[23:52] and he is jaira the Bible says that our
[23:56] hair in our head is numbered
[23:58] he says we cannot lose one strand of
[24:00] hair without him knowing Sparrow can't
[24:02] fall to the ground without him knowing
[24:04] the back cannot bear its eye without him
[24:06] knowing Jehovah Jireh the one Jireh is
[24:09] the one that sees by poor knowledge he
[24:11] knows all things
[24:13] and because he sees the other
[24:16] interpretation is that he sees to it
[24:18] also
[24:19] he's not Gyra the one that sees and then
[24:22] leaves it
[24:24] and that hope something happens when he
[24:26] sees it but no he sees it and he sees to
[24:29] it
[24:30] he makes a probation for it
[24:33] so in other words
[24:35] Jehovah that existed before the
[24:38] foundations of the world before man was
[24:41] even created he saw the future and he
[24:44] saw man would fall
[24:45] and when he saw man would fall he said
[24:48] I'm gonna make a provision for man
[24:50] before he falls
[24:52] you understand that button sisters he
[24:55] doesn't wait for the problem to find the
[24:57] solution he has a solution before the
[24:59] problem
[25:00] he doesn't wait for you to have a need
[25:01] before he provides for your need he
[25:04] already has a provision
[25:06] said before you raise your hand God
[25:08] already knew your problem but he just
[25:11] waited for you to action your faith and
[25:12] say I lift my hand I surrender to him he
[25:15] already knows how it needs he already
[25:17] knows when he's in need and he has
[25:19] already made a provision
[25:21] so he knew man was going to fall and
[25:24] goal of creation will fall before the
[25:26] foundation of the world the Lamb of God
[25:28] was slain
[25:29] eating that God
[25:31] in other words he saw the fall of Man
[25:33] and before Man was created he provided
[25:36] for man the Lamb of God was slain in his
[25:38] thoughts
[25:41] that's Jehovah Jireh that's how Jehovah
[25:44] Jireh Works he knows what it is going to
[25:46] be and he makes a provision before
[25:49] God had seen it
[25:52] and uh then he makes a provision for hit
[25:55] God makes a provision for the fall of
[25:58] Man before man was even created
[26:01] in the thoughts of God the Lamb of God
[26:04] was slain God himself saw himself
[26:07] becoming flesh so himself becoming the
[26:10] lamb to become the atonement for sin to
[26:13] reconcile man back to himself
[26:17] but look what God saw himself do
[26:20] become flesh was going to take a long
[26:23] time
[26:25] said the creation of the Earth in the
[26:27] beginning God God created the Heaven and
[26:29] the Earth full stop granted it took
[26:31] millions of years just to create heavens
[26:33] and earth
[26:34] he said but every other creation the
[26:36] First first day second day was a
[26:37] thousand year at a time but it says
[26:39] before that the Heaven and Earth
[26:40] creation full stop was millions of years
[26:43] so God saw himself become the lamb God
[26:46] saw himself become flesh he took
[26:48] millions of years before he became flesh
[26:50] but the provision was already made
[26:58] so he had a provision
[27:00] and um the prophet says yeah that God's
[27:05] all or he says it but not not as a uh
[27:08] verbatim he says God's first provision
[27:10] was himself becoming the logos
[27:15] God's first provision was Christ
[27:18] and Birmingham says God's first decision
[27:20] is perfect
[27:22] means that when God thought he was going
[27:25] to fix the problem he says I am going to
[27:28] give the solution and the solution is
[27:30] going to be me myself becoming a logos
[27:33] the word
[27:34] Jehovah's provision was Christ
[27:38] like we ran in Colossians all things
[27:41] were made made by him that's Christ for
[27:44] him for his good pleasure and before him
[27:48] was nothing made he knees before all
[27:50] things
[27:51] now we're not talking about the physical
[27:53] body of Jesus Christ
[27:55] that walked on the earth two thousand
[27:57] years ago but we are talking about
[27:59] Christ according to all the prophet
[28:01] teaches us what Christ says
[28:05] all things consist by Christ all things
[28:08] were made for Christ by Christ for his
[28:11] good pleasure
[28:12] and the problem says Christ is the logos
[28:16] Christ is the word himself which is God
[28:18] himself
[28:19] the one that changes form in the
[28:21] beginning was the word the word was with
[28:24] God the Word was God in other words you
[28:27] can say in the beginning was Christ the
[28:29] Christ Christ was with God and Christ
[28:31] was God in the beginning was light light
[28:34] was with God and light was God in the
[28:37] beginning was the anointing the
[28:38] anointing was with God and the anointing
[28:40] was God in the beginning was the
[28:41] anointed one and the anointed one was
[28:43] with God the anointed one was God Amen
[28:47] in other words when Jehovah Elohim saw
[28:50] that it was going to need he was going
[28:52] to make a provision and his provision
[28:54] was going to be himself condescending
[28:57] into the logos the word which is Christ
[29:03] the Lord Jehovah's provision was Christ
[29:06] Jehovah's provision was the word
[29:08] Jehovah's provision was the logos that's
[29:12] his first decision it's his perfect
[29:14] decision and it will not fail
[29:18] praise the Lord the Jehovah Elohim if I
[29:21] can call him like that he changed his
[29:24] form he can't descended to become known
[29:26] as the logos the word Son of God or
[29:29] Christ
[29:30] inside of Jehovah was all of these
[29:33] attributes itself Elohim was all of the
[29:36] attributes
[29:37] all of these thoughts
[29:40] and he expressed all of these thoughts
[29:42] in the word
[29:43] all of these thoughts in the logos
[29:47] now inside of him we know we had he had
[29:50] the attribute of being a Healer
[29:53] that's why it's called Jehovah the one
[29:55] that wants to express himself as a
[29:56] Healer Jehovah Rapha
[29:59] and so he expressed that attribute in
[30:01] the word the logos
[30:04] now I'm going to share all these quotes
[30:05] and so that we can just all be on the
[30:08] same line of thought this morning the
[30:10] end time sign seed
[30:13] it starts up with so I never touched the
[30:15] child
[30:16] he's talking about a child that was six
[30:18] uh six 620319
[30:21] Prophet says so I never touched the
[30:23] child at all
[30:25] I went right to the pulpit with the word
[30:28] and stayed right with the word
[30:30] and the word healed us so instantly
[30:33] until she got up and walked away
[30:36] he's all right now living like anybody
[30:38] else so means he's saying she's all
[30:40] right now living like anybody else can't
[30:43] find it say something anywhere never
[30:46] even touched what he wants to say never
[30:49] he or never even touched her so brother
[30:52] is saying I never even touched her I
[30:55] never even prayed for her but the word
[30:57] went far
[31:00] and he says you see the word went forth
[31:03] she believed the word
[31:05] and the word is God's life and God's
[31:08] power
[31:09] and the word is what does it the word
[31:12] heals the sick
[31:14] unquote
[31:15] so we find our judge that all the
[31:18] attributes of healing was all poured out
[31:20] into the word the logos so in other
[31:23] words Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Sharma the
[31:25] one that wants a year all those
[31:27] attributes is in the word
[31:31] his perfect provision was the word
[31:35] itself
[31:36] his public provision was the logos
[31:38] itself his public provision was the
[31:41] anointing or the anointed one or the Son
[31:43] of God himself before he become flesh
[31:46] means his perfect provision was himself
[31:49] changing his form
[31:51] Hallelujah so he could make himself
[31:54] known
[31:55] make his attributes known
[31:59] so in Elohim had the attributes of being
[32:01] a
[32:02] he Prophet says the word Is A Healer
[32:05] the word heals instead of healing was
[32:08] the attribute to be a savior Jehovah
[32:11] said can you and he expressed all of
[32:14] that attribute in the word in the quote
[32:17] God keeps his word 570306
[32:20] the very short quote
[32:23] he says men are not saved by emotions
[32:26] and all the little sad stories you tell
[32:29] man saved by the word of God
[32:32] that suddenly fixed me up
[32:35] end of quote means man is not saved by
[32:38] emotions not saved by little sad stories
[32:41] but man is saved by the word of God
[32:45] it's the word that was made flesh it's
[32:49] the word that become the atonement the
[32:51] body was just gonna be the sacrifice on
[32:53] the cross but Saving Grace was through
[32:56] the word
[32:59] you love the Lord
[33:01] you know even the slain slain lamb in
[33:04] the Old Testament could not do anything
[33:05] because they needed the blood from that
[33:07] lamb
[33:08] because the blood was their life
[33:11] the slain goat could not do anything
[33:12] because they needed the blood from the
[33:14] goat to go into the most holy place the
[33:16] slain body of Jesus Christ cannot do
[33:18] anything unless the life comes out of
[33:20] that body and comes onto a believer
[33:22] the light is the word himself it's the
[33:26] word that heals it's the word that saves
[33:30] you you know we normally say I I we are
[33:33] healed I'm saved because Jesus was
[33:35] hooted for my transgression bruised my
[33:37] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[33:39] was upon him with his stripes I'm Healed
[33:41] well you have to know what we are
[33:43] talking about
[33:44] who is this Jesus
[33:46] Jesus is the word made flesh
[33:50] the book The Invisible Union of the
[33:52] bride of Christ 65 11 25 paragraph 274.
[33:58] you bear with me I'm just laying down
[34:00] something
[34:02] he says pure unadulterated he says oh
[34:05] Hallelujah leaving soon for the skies
[34:08] amen standing ready think your garments
[34:12] washed By the Waters of the bleeding
[34:14] word
[34:16] the word become blood the word bled for
[34:19] you and you are washed in the bleeding
[34:22] word the word bleeding program says the
[34:25] life of God in the word and the Word was
[34:28] bled for you that you might be washed
[34:30] from the foot of these prostitutes and
[34:33] be cleansed and certified by the washing
[34:35] of the water of the word and makes your
[34:38] mind and heart stayed on God and on his
[34:41] word
[34:43] so we have to get our thinking right
[34:45] brothers and sisters because we are
[34:47] stuck in the old traditional
[34:49] denominational teaching about who God is
[34:51] and we go back to a man with a long
[34:54] beard and a long hair and a white
[34:55] garment but that man is the word made
[34:57] flesh
[34:58] that man is the logos himself
[35:01] condescended created by creative power a
[35:04] body to come and become a sacrifice
[35:07] that's right by the battle yeah he said
[35:09] after the opening of the seals he says
[35:11] the Bible becomes a new book after the
[35:13] opening of the Season says the word bled
[35:16] for you the word died for you you are
[35:19] Washed by the bleeding word
[35:22] all of God's attribute was expressed in
[35:26] the word
[35:27] elohim's provision was in the word the
[35:30] logos a perfect provision
[35:33] unquote
[35:35] they see Jehovah's provision
[35:38] was the logos
[35:40] or Jehovah's provision is the word all
[35:43] the time and the word is he himself
[35:47] means that he changing his mom he
[35:50] Jehovah becomes our provision
[35:54] in the beginning was the word the word
[35:56] was with God and the Word was God and
[35:58] then that word became flesh
[36:01] God's provision for man
[36:04] is the word himself the one that changes
[36:07] form that we come from invisible to
[36:10] something visible
[36:11] God's provision before the foundation of
[36:14] the world was the word of the logos
[36:17] God's provision is the word and the
[36:20] logos today still
[36:23] because if it changes it means god
[36:25] changed and God cannot change
[36:28] God cannot change and still be God
[36:32] 's provision is himself but he changed
[36:36] his Spawn from Elohim to become the
[36:38] logos or the word and in the logos the
[36:41] word is all our provision
[36:44] every need that we have is met by the
[36:47] word
[36:50] Hebrew study in verse 8 say Jesus Christ
[36:53] is the same yesterday today and forever
[36:56] in the book calling Jesus on the scene
[36:58] 630804 paragraph 90
[37:02] Ram says
[37:05] he said this is him
[37:07] in the beginning was the word and the
[37:10] Word was with God and the Word was God
[37:12] and the word is the same yesterday today
[37:15] and forever
[37:18] it's still just take this it's the it's
[37:21] the remedy
[37:23] it's the medicine it's the cure for
[37:26] every breakdown it's the cure for every
[37:28] Cancer it's a cure for every ailment
[37:31] it's God manifested in a word the word
[37:34] is God
[37:36] amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[37:38] today and forever is not in reference to
[37:41] a physical man a body that was created
[37:43] but it's the word that is the same
[37:46] the word that does not change the word
[37:48] that is eternal the word that is God
[37:51] himself
[37:53] which is Jehovah's provision
[37:57] it's what makes him Gyra is the word the
[38:01] word manifested makes him gyro this
[38:03] morning
[38:05] and brother bear says it's the remedy
[38:07] it's the medicine it's the cure for
[38:09] every breakdown it's a key of every
[38:11] Cancer it's a cure for every ailment
[38:12] it's God manifested in a word the word
[38:15] is God
[38:18] so the word of the logos himself is the
[38:21] same all the time he Remains the Same he
[38:24] cannot change he cannot change his mind
[38:26] he is the constant he acts the same way
[38:29] he always done
[38:31] he behavedness in One Way Before He'll
[38:34] behave the same way now but the Bible
[38:36] says
[38:37] when God made man in Eden
[38:40] what did he give man to fortify himself
[38:43] gave him the word
[38:45] nothing else but the word
[38:47] the prophet says the word is the same
[38:50] he says but the veil keeps changing
[38:53] when he is a cried out to God for
[38:55] deliverance God come down to Moses the
[38:58] word came to Moses but he veiled in a
[39:01] bush
[39:02] when they were in the wilderness
[39:04] the prophet says they needed a deliverer
[39:07] when he went in the wilderness the word
[39:09] veiled in a plural of cloud
[39:11] amen he said the same word change its
[39:14] Veil and he was veiling they put up fire
[39:17] at night
[39:19] and when Moses built a tabernacle he
[39:21] says the word came down and veiled
[39:23] behind magic skin
[39:25] the prophet says in Mighty God unveil
[39:28] unveiling God it says the word Veil
[39:30] behind the skin of Moses
[39:33] he says the same word veiled behind
[39:35] Solomon
[39:37] 2000 years ago the veil had changed the
[39:40] veil the word become veiled in a flesh
[39:43] of a man called Jesus Christ
[39:46] but the word is the same
[39:48] but the veil kept changing
[39:51] so Jehovah means to become known
[39:55] to reveal himself and he chose to reveal
[39:57] himself in the logos or in the word
[40:03] Jara to make provision
[40:05] his provision is the word his provision
[40:07] is the logos and it's a perfect decision
[40:10] brothers and sisters
[40:13] every need of man is met in the logos
[40:16] every need of man is met in the word
[40:19] by the word because it's God himself
[40:22] when God asks Abraham he said take your
[40:26] son
[40:26] up to Mount Moriah to offer him as a
[40:30] sacrifice
[40:32] Isaac said father we have the word and
[40:36] we have the fire but where is the
[40:38] sacrifice
[40:40] and Abraham answered and said God will
[40:43] provide himself the lamb
[40:48] now you know when you read that uh that
[40:51] that portion of scripture there was real
[40:53] omnipotent faith that Abraham had
[40:57] because when Abraham spoke this word it
[40:59] had creative power
[41:01] and God heard the word of Abraham and
[41:04] God answered
[41:06] Abraham yeah
[41:08] notice God never spoke to Abraham about
[41:11] any lamb or any Ram he just said take
[41:14] your son Isaac up to Mount Moriah and
[41:16] offer him a sacrifice to God
[41:20] never said anything about a lamb or a
[41:22] ram but Abraham caught the mind of God
[41:26] Abraham caught the word of God
[41:28] and God honored it because it was his
[41:32] word
[41:34] you you understand it brother and sister
[41:37] why God honored the words of Abraham
[41:39] because that was God's word
[41:43] God Abraham said God will provide
[41:45] himself a lamb
[41:47] or should we say like this yeah God will
[41:50] provide himself
[41:52] as a ram
[41:55] means that every need as we said is met
[41:58] in him
[41:59] every need is met in the word
[42:03] the prophet says
[42:05] this Bible
[42:07] is the is is God in print form
[42:11] it's called the word of God but it's
[42:13] actually God in print form
[42:17] there's many occults like that that you
[42:19] find in God in pin form is his Bible
[42:22] he says this Bible that we that we have
[42:25] is God in print form
[42:27] means whenever God expressed in the
[42:29] logos he put it here in print form on
[42:32] these pages
[42:34] now these words Bible is called The Holy
[42:36] Bible
[42:37] and remember there's only one that is
[42:40] Holy and that's God himself so how can
[42:42] this book become a holy book
[42:44] unless it's the holy God in print form
[42:48] and Superman says the Bible is God in
[42:50] print form he says it's the thoughts of
[42:53] God laying in the Bible in seed form
[42:57] you understand that he says the very
[42:59] thoughts of God are laying in the Bible
[43:01] in seed form
[43:05] he says that when a Believer reads the
[43:07] Bible and catches the thought that God
[43:10] had put in print form
[43:11] he says then it will materialize in that
[43:13] believer's life
[43:18] now we want to turn to Genesis chapter
[43:20] 22.
[43:26] Genesis 22 from verse 7
[43:30] . just touch on this
[43:33] story of Abraham and Isaac a little bit
[43:36] this is an Isaac spake unto Abraham's
[43:38] father
[43:39] and said my father and he said yeah yeah
[43:42] am I
[43:44] my son
[43:45] and he said behold the fire
[43:48] behold the wood
[43:50] but where is a lamb for a burnt offering
[43:53] and Abraham said my son God will provide
[43:56] himself
[43:58] a lamb
[44:00] for a burnt offering means God will
[44:02] provide himself as that lamb for a burnt
[44:05] offering
[44:06] because he is the provision
[44:10] the word himself became flesh
[44:13] Jesus Christ was not another person that
[44:16] was going to come and die but God was
[44:18] going to provide himself a lamb two
[44:22] thousand years ago
[44:24] let me give you a quote before can you
[44:26] show us the father
[44:29] 630606 paragraph 186
[44:34] and Prophet says and God's law has
[44:36] penalty
[44:38] that in the day you eat thereof that day
[44:40] you die
[44:42] and when men eat thereof he said there's
[44:44] not he said 187 he says God could not
[44:47] send another person to take their place
[44:50] it would be unjust again
[44:52] for to for me to make this brother die
[44:55] for what this other brother done
[44:58] it would be wrong you see God had to
[45:01] come himself
[45:03] and the only way he could do it would be
[45:05] it would be it would come in his own
[45:07] flesh
[45:08] which was his own Creative Body that he
[45:10] made himself that he could suffer dead
[45:13] amen
[45:14] amen so my mom is saying God will be
[45:16] unjust
[45:17] if God put it on another man so God's
[45:21] provision had to be himself
[45:23] Burger 188 he said there is the gospel
[45:26] in the power
[45:28] that's God manifested In the Flesh
[45:30] Emmanuel to take away the sins of the
[45:33] world and in that blood We Trust not in
[45:37] the Jew or the Gentile but in the blood
[45:39] of God which was Jesus Christ that's the
[45:42] reason he said I and my father are one
[45:45] my father dwelleth in me it was the
[45:48] father in him brother and says
[45:51] what is the prophet saying here it was
[45:53] the logos or the word made flesh inside
[45:55] of him that came to die at Calvary
[46:00] so the culture that we're reading is
[46:02] whatever he's saying it's unjust if God
[46:05] who is the word
[46:07] God who is the logos God who is the Son
[46:10] of God is unjust if you send somebody
[46:13] else to die
[46:14] so God provided himself
[46:17] the logos the word to come down and
[46:19] become flesh to die for the sins of the
[46:22] world
[46:23] amen
[46:25] and that's why I said when Abraham said
[46:28] God will provide himself God haunted
[46:30] those words because it was God's Own
[46:32] word
[46:34] Abraham said God will provide himself a
[46:37] lamb
[46:40] notice before the world could exist
[46:43] God provided himself the logos
[46:46] God provided himself the word as our
[46:50] provision
[46:52] now you're watching Abraham just catch
[46:55] your story a little bit
[46:57] God said to Abraham
[46:59] you know the prophet has taught us that
[47:01] when you read the Bible
[47:03] the Bible can be a storybook
[47:06] or the Bible can be made alive for your
[47:08] day
[47:09] as Satan word of God is not a dead book
[47:12] it's a living book and so when you read
[47:15] the Bible you must see yourself in the
[47:17] scripture you may see your day and your
[47:19] message in the scripture
[47:22] and so God said to Abraham he says take
[47:24] thy son thine only begotten son whom
[47:28] doubt lovest
[47:30] now you notice that there's a jewel
[47:32] inspiration here in the scripture
[47:35] because
[47:37] it's God you're in Prophecy
[47:39] and one of the thing is Jesus Christ
[47:44] the only begotten
[47:50] the only begotten son of the father
[47:54] and your God is saying to Abraham take
[47:56] thine son
[47:58] that only begotten son
[48:00] but we know that was not the only
[48:02] begotten son of Abraham
[48:04] because Abraham already had an ishma
[48:07] before Isaac can come along but yet the
[48:10] scripture is saying Abraham who is the
[48:12] father
[48:13] take thy son thine only begotten son
[48:18] whom thou lovest
[48:21] can you see the words
[48:23] that God is relating to Abraham
[48:28] the father has an only begotten son
[48:33] the scripture says Jesus Christ whom the
[48:35] father loved and put all things in his
[48:38] hand and yet God is saying to Abraham
[48:41] take thy son and only begotten son whom
[48:43] thou lovest
[48:45] so even God you're in Genesis he's not
[48:47] even talking about Isaac he's talking
[48:49] about himself that will become flesh
[48:52] and Abraham catches the word of God and
[48:55] he says and God will provide himself a
[48:57] lamb
[48:58] means that God is speaking in Prophecy
[49:01] Abraham is responding in Prophecy
[49:09] so yeah when we hear this conversation
[49:12] is speaking about God's own son
[49:15] God himself that becomes a provision as
[49:17] the lamb
[49:18] then Abraham said to Isaac God will
[49:21] provide himself a lamb means the logos
[49:23] himself will become human flesh
[49:26] to take the place of every sinner on the
[49:28] cross
[49:29] he will hang on those sticks that man
[49:31] golgana
[49:32] God's thoughts expressing
[49:35] in the word before the foundation of the
[49:37] world now it has creative power
[49:41] he spoke it before the foundation of the
[49:43] world but that word was going to create
[49:45] later on
[49:48] so that's why I'm saying brothers and
[49:50] sisters if it's going to take God
[49:52] millions of years for his spoken word to
[49:54] create a body for him to come and become
[49:56] the sacrifice what about you and I why
[49:58] can't we wait 21 days in six weeks and
[50:01] three weeks and two weeks if the word is
[50:04] spoken if God could wait for that word
[50:06] to be material to materialized so long
[50:08] how how much more can we wait
[50:11] for a month or two months or a year or
[50:13] six months or six weeks whatever it is
[50:15] but how much more we can wait this
[50:17] morning when the word goes forward
[50:20] for it to materialize
[50:23] that's what the prophet is teaching us
[50:24] it says You must you must stay under the
[50:26] anointing when it's revealed to you and
[50:29] it's you know it's finished you hold on
[50:31] until it's until it's finished
[50:34] don't look at the symptoms and be
[50:35] discouraged
[50:40] so God's thoughts was expressed in the
[50:42] word before the foundation of the world
[50:44] and his word that a creative power
[50:47] and it had to wait for a certain time to
[50:50] create a body a lamb
[50:53] Abraham caught the revelation of the
[50:55] word and he spoke it
[50:57] you notice here Abraham said God will
[51:00] provide himself a lamb
[51:03] a lamb is a young sheep
[51:05] not not an old one
[51:08] and Jesus Christ was the Lamb of God
[51:11] and he was not an old man he was 33
[51:14] years old
[51:15] he was the Lamb of God he was young
[51:18] and he was the one that was to take away
[51:20] the sins of the world
[51:22] the scripture says he was led like a
[51:24] lamb to the slaughter
[51:27] Calvary two thousand years ago
[51:30] but you watch it the Bible says Abraham
[51:32] raised his hand and an angel speaks to
[51:35] him
[51:39] let's go to verse 9.
[51:41] there's two things Happening Here
[51:45] are happening here
[51:46] the one yeah is
[51:50] Mount Moriah then Abraham's having a
[51:53] conversation with Elohim with God
[51:55] himself
[51:56] and God is prophesying about a future
[51:59] event and Abraham in response he catches
[52:02] the mind of God and he's prophesying
[52:03] about a future event
[52:05] that future event is about a lamb and
[52:08] the lamb materialized 2000 years ago
[52:11] Jesus Christ but watch the third thing
[52:14] that is taking place on Mount Moriah
[52:17] verse 9 it says and they came to the
[52:20] place which God had told him of and
[52:22] Abraham built an altar there
[52:23] and laid the wooden order
[52:26] and bound Isaac his son
[52:28] and laid him on the altar upon the wood
[52:31] in verse 10 and Abraham stretched for
[52:33] his hand and took the knife to slay his
[52:36] son
[52:37] verse 11. 11 is 10 plus 1.
[52:43] and the angel of the Lord
[52:45] it's an Angel that's what the Bible says
[52:47] right an angel
[52:49] called unto him out of the out of heaven
[52:53] now this Angel is not yet on Earth but
[52:55] this Angel is in heaven
[52:58] in verse 11 10 plus one
[53:02] and the angel comes out of heaven
[53:05] is it Abraham Abraham Abraham said
[53:09] yemayi verse 12 he said lay not thine
[53:12] hand upon the land
[53:14] neither do thou anything unto him for
[53:17] now I know that thou fear is God seeing
[53:20] that thou is not with hell thy son thine
[53:23] only son from me
[53:27] now this is an angel that comes to
[53:29] Abraham but now the angel is saying you
[53:32] are not without your only son from me
[53:34] in other words this Angel is God himself
[53:37] God coming down in a form of an angel in
[53:40] verse 11 10 plus one
[53:44] means god appearing as an angel
[53:46] Revelation 10 1.
[53:48] we're going to watch the two prophecies
[53:50] at Mount Moriah
[53:53] Isaac is on the altar but Abraham says
[53:56] God will provide himself a lamb and the
[53:59] lamb was made flesh at Calvary
[54:02] but this is a different scene that is
[54:04] taking place
[54:05] now an Angel is coming down on Mount
[54:07] Moriah
[54:08] and this Angel is coming down and
[54:10] Abraham is speaking to the Angel and the
[54:12] angel is revealing that I am God
[54:14] Almighty amen
[54:18] means it's a coming of Christ to Abraham
[54:23] you love the Lord
[54:26] in other words burn sisters there's two
[54:28] comings being revealed Right Here Mount
[54:30] Moriah
[54:31] the first one behold God will provide
[54:34] himself a lamb the first coming
[54:37] but there's another coming there's the
[54:39] angel coming down from heaven Revelation
[54:41] 10 1 he's declaring that I am God
[54:44] himself and now there's another message
[54:46] another coming
[54:51] notice the Revelation yeah unfolding of
[54:55] this angel coming down to Abraham
[54:57] the angel said thou did not did uh
[55:00] doubted not with all thine only son for
[55:03] me
[55:04] in other words these angels coming with
[55:07] a seven seal mystery
[55:10] the mystery that come to the seven Angel
[55:13] messenger the mystery of God will be
[55:16] finished
[55:17] and his Angel yeah he's saying to the
[55:19] prophet Abraham
[55:20] that this is me God Almighty coming down
[55:23] now at Mount Moriah
[55:25] lay not your hand on the land
[55:28] so God is revealing the mystery of
[55:30] himself through an angel to Abraham
[55:34] verse 13 look what Abraham does
[55:37] Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked
[55:43] Abraham's not looking on the ground
[55:46] Abraham's lifting up his eyes
[55:48] the Angel is coming down
[55:51] verse 11 10 1 the angel is declaring
[55:54] that this is God Almighty coming down
[55:56] Abraham lifts up his eyes and Abraham
[55:58] looks into the sky
[56:01] if I'm wrong you can tell me I'm wrong
[56:05] he looks and the Bible says and behold
[56:08] behind him a ram caught in the thicket
[56:11] by his horns
[56:15] now it's very strange brothers and
[56:16] sisters
[56:18] there's two things here
[56:20] if a normal person just reads the Bible
[56:23] and wants to condemn our Bible they're
[56:25] going to tell us Abraham said the Lord
[56:27] will provide a lamb God put a ram a lamb
[56:32] is under 12 months old a ram is much
[56:34] older than 12 months
[56:36] so they can technically come and tell us
[56:38] a lamb and a ram now is two different
[56:40] age groups they can come and question
[56:43] what we are saying in the Bible
[56:46] then you read the Bible here it says
[56:48] Abraham lifted up his eyes
[56:50] he looked so he's looking upwards but
[56:53] behind him is a ram caught in the ticket
[56:55] of his horns means that he's looking
[56:57] upwards and when he looks up he sees
[56:58] alarm in the sky caught in the ticket
[57:01] by his horns
[57:05] notice the mighty angel
[57:08] provides himself as a ram this time
[57:12] not as a lamb
[57:15] a ram is a mature sheep
[57:18] like you and I one time we were five
[57:20] years old another time we are 20 years
[57:23] old then another time in your life
[57:25] you're 30 years old and so forth and so
[57:27] forth but you know it's the same person
[57:29] but just different dispensations of Our
[57:32] Lives
[57:33] one time we're like a lamb we are young
[57:35] one time we're like a ram we are old but
[57:38] it's a self-same person but the
[57:39] dispensation of our life is changed
[57:44] it's not what I'm saying here is Abraham
[57:47] is speaking about one dispensation in
[57:48] the lamb and then there's another
[57:50] dispensation being revealed also on
[57:52] Mount Moriah
[57:53] the two comings
[57:57] so you see it's the same person
[57:59] but being revealed in different
[58:01] dispensations
[58:03] so too is the Lamb and the ram it's a
[58:07] same person but being revealed in
[58:09] different dispensations
[58:12] Abraham said God will provide himself a
[58:15] lamb and the lamb was provided at
[58:17] Calvary but this time God Is providing a
[58:21] ram also
[58:26] the ram
[58:27] like Buddha ma'am says
[58:30] now it's the second crucifixion
[58:33] it's a different dispensation
[58:35] remember the problem preaching
[58:37] indictment message
[58:39] he said I indict this generation for the
[58:41] second crucifixion
[58:43] of the word afresh
[58:46] the word bled for you at Calvary because
[58:49] the word was made flesh now the same
[58:51] word again in this day is bleeding again
[58:54] it's the same bleeding word but in that
[58:56] dispensation he was a lamb and this
[58:59] dispensation he's a ram
[59:02] you gotta understand what I'm saying now
[59:05] the problem says I indict this
[59:07] generation with the second crucifixion
[59:09] of the word of Flesh because it rejected
[59:12] Revelation chapter 10.
[59:16] Abraham now sees a ram and not a lamb
[59:21] a ram is a mature sheep means that is a
[59:24] ram looks much older
[59:28] when you watch him appear on Sunset
[59:31] Mountain
[59:32] Prophet says he has a white wig on
[59:36] Mindy speaks about maturity
[59:39] the promise calls him the Ancient of
[59:41] Days
[59:42] he's looking older at 33 he's got normal
[59:46] looking hair black or brown whatever it
[59:48] was but at the age of but in this age
[59:51] when he comes he has a white wig on
[59:54] means two thousand years ago he was a
[59:56] lamb looking young 33 years old but now
[59:59] when he comes on Mount son said he's got
[1:00:00] a white wig he's looking like a ram
[1:00:04] Howard says he appears on Sunset
[1:00:06] mountain with a white wing he is Judge
[1:00:11] causing the Ancient of Days
[1:00:13] means now it's a ram
[1:00:15] oh it's the Lamb with white hair
[1:00:18] different dispensation of the same
[1:00:20] person
[1:00:28] the angel
[1:00:30] he said to Abraham
[1:00:32] or the mighty Angel like we're saying
[1:00:34] comes down to Abraham
[1:00:36] and he makes a provision
[1:00:40] he makes a provision for Abraham but he
[1:00:42] also makes a provision for Isaac
[1:00:46] Isaac is the true Seed of Abraham
[1:00:51] and Isaac would have died there on that
[1:00:53] mountain
[1:00:55] but you know we also would have died
[1:00:59] like Isaac would have died
[1:01:02] would have died because the prophet says
[1:01:04] we were in a denominational death trap
[1:01:08] we were under a Pentecostal
[1:01:10] denominational teaching
[1:01:13] but then the angel has to come
[1:01:16] the angel had to come so it could
[1:01:18] deliver Isaac
[1:01:20] the angel had to come now because it had
[1:01:22] to come with a message of Grace Grace to
[1:01:25] deliver the true seed again now
[1:01:29] this Mighty Angel comes to Abraham
[1:01:31] he makes a provision for the true Seed
[1:01:34] of Abraham to escape judgment and death
[1:01:37] Abraham types a prophet the angel comes
[1:01:40] to the prophet but he delivers the Seed
[1:01:43] of Abraham
[1:01:44] the mighty Angel comes down today to a
[1:01:46] prophet
[1:01:47] but he comes to deliver the true Seed of
[1:01:50] Abraham you and I
[1:01:54] he looks behind him Abraham
[1:01:56] you see the ram caught in the thicket of
[1:01:59] a bush
[1:02:01] remember I said that Abraham looks his
[1:02:05] eyes are lifted up and he looks he looks
[1:02:07] up and it seems now as if Abraham is
[1:02:10] looking up and he sees a ram caught in
[1:02:12] the ticket of a bush
[1:02:14] me the head of a ram in the bush
[1:02:18] the Hebrew word for am
[1:02:20] is the word AV
[1:02:24] it means ticket
[1:02:26] the ticket of a bush
[1:02:28] but that word has a dual purpose
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:32] in other words when you read that you
[1:02:33] read it the ram the head of the ram is
[1:02:36] stuck in the thicket of a bush
[1:02:38] but the other meaning of the word have
[1:02:41] means a thick cloud
[1:02:46] lifted up his eyes and he looked
[1:02:49] he saw the ram the face of the Ram stuck
[1:02:52] in a thick cloud
[1:02:55] you see that brother and sisters
[1:02:58] now it's for believers
[1:03:00] it's our message today yes we're gonna
[1:03:03] look into the Bible and we see Isaac and
[1:03:05] Abraham and we say oh well such Grace
[1:03:07] Jehovah Jireh when we look in the Bible
[1:03:09] and Abraham says God himself shall
[1:03:11] provide a lamb and we look back two
[1:03:13] thousand years ago oh that was Grace
[1:03:15] 2000 years ago but what about today
[1:03:18] how does that scripture fulfill today
[1:03:20] and so the Hebrew word for AV means
[1:03:24] sticking up a bush or it means a thick
[1:03:26] cloud
[1:03:27] means when Abraham lifted up his eyes
[1:03:29] and he looked in the sky he saw a thick
[1:03:31] cloud
[1:03:32] and in the thick Cloud was a face a
[1:03:34] realm of a heart of a the face of a horn
[1:03:37] the horns of a Ram stuck in that cloud
[1:03:44] you see that brown sisters
[1:03:46] in other words
[1:03:48] Abraham lifted up and looked he saw in
[1:03:51] the ticket of a cloud a Ram's face
[1:03:56] the ram the face of a Ram stuck in the
[1:03:58] cloud
[1:04:01] you see what's happening on Mount Moriah
[1:04:04] Mount Moriah is the exact same spot
[1:04:07] where the temple was built later on
[1:04:11] where the holy Place laid on that
[1:04:13] mountain
[1:04:14] it was the exact same place the cloud
[1:04:17] would go and sit behind the most holy
[1:04:19] place
[1:04:20] means a cloud was going to descend on
[1:04:23] that mountain
[1:04:25] on Mount Moriah and Abraham yeah
[1:04:27] entitled looking up and the ram is stuck
[1:04:29] in a cloud
[1:04:31] it's our message brothers and sisters
[1:04:36] the two events
[1:04:38] I'll prophesied Young montmoriah Abraham
[1:04:42] speaks about the first coming in lamb
[1:04:43] and then God reveals the second coming a
[1:04:46] Ram stuck in the ticket of a cloud
[1:04:51] on the day of the crucifixion the
[1:04:52] prophet says when Christ hung on the
[1:04:55] cross the lamb
[1:04:57] he says that the priest went into the
[1:05:00] temple
[1:05:02] and he was offering incense in the
[1:05:04] temple
[1:05:05] and Christ the lamb was hanging on the
[1:05:07] cross
[1:05:08] he says that when Christ gave up the
[1:05:11] ghost the Earth shook would not break
[1:05:15] and when the Earthship would not break
[1:05:17] the promises and the Bible says the
[1:05:19] temple veil went into
[1:05:22] it and said when the temple veil went
[1:05:24] into the priest looked out of the temple
[1:05:26] he saw a man hanging on the cross and
[1:05:29] the promise is the Lamb was hanging on
[1:05:31] the cross
[1:05:34] on that crucifixion day
[1:05:37] Christ the lamb hanging on the cross
[1:05:40] cross
[1:05:41] Jehovah provided himself a sacrifice
[1:05:46] then the prophet brings it down to this
[1:05:48] day
[1:05:50] and he preaches an indictment message
[1:05:53] god making another provision
[1:05:56] he said the mighty Angels descended
[1:05:58] crying Grace Grace Grace
[1:06:00] but the promise of wine is bringing
[1:06:02] grace to the bride he says it brings
[1:06:04] judgment to the denominational world
[1:06:08] why because they crucified the word of
[1:06:10] thrush
[1:06:12] they put him on a denominational cross
[1:06:14] in this day
[1:06:16] and the Bible says Revelation 10 1 when
[1:06:18] he comes down he cries out with a loud
[1:06:21] voice
[1:06:23] seven Thunders are to The Voice
[1:06:26] what happened on Mount Sunset the Earth
[1:06:28] shut Like An Earthquake
[1:06:31] can you see the event replaying itself
[1:06:34] the prophecy of Genesis 22 being
[1:06:37] fulfilled
[1:06:39] Abraham sees a lamb
[1:06:41] Calvary God brings a lamb today's
[1:06:44] message
[1:06:46] they have the sticks that Christ must
[1:06:48] lay on they have the cloud in the sky
[1:06:50] the ticket of the cloud that will be
[1:06:52] crucified now on a dinama national cross
[1:06:56] you love the Lord
[1:06:58] the angel comes down the cloud appears
[1:07:01] on Mount sunset
[1:07:02] it's a face it's a face in the cloud
[1:07:06] because it's a ram in the ticket of a
[1:07:09] cloud and there's a face in the cloud
[1:07:11] means that his face is stuck in the
[1:07:13] cloud the ticket of a cloud
[1:07:16] the same lamb but he has white hair
[1:07:20] a dispensation change
[1:07:23] he's rejected in this day
[1:07:25] the word is crucified afresh in this day
[1:07:29] and what happens just like that they had
[1:07:31] Calvary there was an earthquake on Mount
[1:07:33] sunset
[1:07:34] the Earth shook and Bob says what
[1:07:37] happened in this day he said then the
[1:07:39] nominational veil renting too
[1:07:44] is that right brothers and sisters
[1:07:46] said that
[1:07:48] a denominational Veil went into this day
[1:07:52] he said we've been blinded by the normal
[1:07:54] National vein all of these years
[1:07:57] until this Angel comes down and opens
[1:08:00] the seal and the Bible becomes a brand
[1:08:02] new book and by the rejection of this
[1:08:04] message the denominational veil has been
[1:08:06] went into
[1:08:08] the Earth shakes and when the bride
[1:08:10] looks we look we lift up our eyes and we
[1:08:13] look Dame the ticket of a clown is a ram
[1:08:16] god making a provision for the bride
[1:08:20] thank you
[1:08:21] now the prophet says now we look beyond
[1:08:24] the denominational Veil like the priest
[1:08:27] now the veil was 22 and he looked beyond
[1:08:29] the Veil
[1:08:30] and the veil revealed a man hanging on
[1:08:33] the cross a lamb God's provision the
[1:08:36] word himself the logos materialized in
[1:08:38] human flesh was hanging on a cross
[1:08:42] the veil was ran now they look beyond
[1:08:45] the denominational Veil two thousand
[1:08:47] years ago the Jewish dinama National
[1:08:50] Veil the Jewish tradition they look past
[1:08:52] their tradition and they saw God's
[1:08:54] provision on the cross
[1:08:56] now when we are stuck we are like Isaac
[1:08:59] we should have been put to death a
[1:09:01] spiritual death but God has made a way
[1:09:04] for us God has made a provision for us a
[1:09:07] Ram stuck in a thick cloud
[1:09:11] and what happens when they're rejecting
[1:09:13] the denomination of veil renting too
[1:09:16] now we can lift up our eyes and we can
[1:09:18] look and we can see God's provision it's
[1:09:20] the same word the same logos God himself
[1:09:24] coming down in this age
[1:09:29] if it was someone else it'll be unjust
[1:09:32] it had to be he himself
[1:09:34] coming in this age to come and take us
[1:09:37] out of a denominational death
[1:09:43] we look past the denominational Veil we
[1:09:46] lift up our eyes and we see a Ram stuck
[1:09:48] we see a face in the ticket of a cloud
[1:09:51] Bible said who was worthy to take the
[1:09:53] book
[1:09:54] the lamb was worthy to take the book
[1:09:57] and the lamb has come down this day but
[1:09:59] he's come with a white wing making him a
[1:10:01] ram make him a judge the older than the
[1:10:04] older version of a lamb or the different
[1:10:06] dispensation that is revealing himself
[1:10:09] and he comes to judge those that reject
[1:10:12] this message
[1:10:13] he's the Ancient of Days he's the white
[1:10:16] wing one he is the Lamb that has come
[1:10:19] with Grace
[1:10:20] but dressed in a white wig as a ram
[1:10:23] we look into the cloud
[1:10:26] we look into the sky
[1:10:28] well the BAM says there was no moisture
[1:10:32] in the sky at that height for the cloud
[1:10:36] to be formed
[1:10:39] said there was no moisture that
[1:10:42] cloud
[1:10:43] in the sky
[1:10:44] what happened that day on the 28th of
[1:10:47] February brother and sisters
[1:10:49] was God confirming his word
[1:10:52] what was spoken in Genesis 22
[1:10:56] God put it in the sky
[1:10:59] what was prophesied in Genesis 22 when
[1:11:02] there was no moisture gone by his own
[1:11:05] word sent his word for it had a creative
[1:11:08] power it put a cloud in the sky
[1:11:11] I hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:11:14] you read Genesis 22
[1:11:16] there is the word of God
[1:11:19] thousands of years later the word that
[1:11:21] went forth to Abraham it materializes on
[1:11:24] Mount sunset
[1:11:26] God's word becomes materialized and it
[1:11:28] puts a cloud in the sky where there's no
[1:11:30] moisture there
[1:11:33] the same one that created the squirrels
[1:11:35] in the wilderness when there was no
[1:11:37] squirrels there
[1:11:38] God bring his word to pass
[1:11:41] God's God's Own creative power after his
[1:11:45] word has gone forth
[1:11:48] God himself has done it in this day
[1:11:51] he does not leave it for the
[1:11:52] nominational church it does not leave
[1:11:54] for a movement it does not leave for a
[1:11:56] man he did not leave it to William
[1:11:58] Branham but God himself becomes the
[1:12:01] sacrifice this day God himself created a
[1:12:04] cloud when there was no Cloud God
[1:12:06] himself comes again to deliver us public
[1:12:08] denominational death
[1:12:11] God's provision the logos of the word
[1:12:15] his creative power went beyond and it
[1:12:18] created himself
[1:12:19] this day in the form of a cloud a
[1:12:22] sacrifice for us
[1:12:25] Abraham call the name of that place
[1:12:27] verse 14.
[1:12:28] Genesis verse 14.
[1:12:32] Abram called the name of that place
[1:12:34] Jehovah Jireh as it is said even to this
[1:12:38] day
[1:12:40] in the Mount of the Lord it shall be
[1:12:42] seen
[1:12:44] the reference they they are referring to
[1:12:46] here
[1:12:47] Mount Moriah is the Jewish temple
[1:12:50] says even till this day it shall be seen
[1:12:53] but what shall be seen what does the
[1:12:55] temple have to do with what happened on
[1:12:58] Mount Moriah
[1:13:01] because there the lamb was slain
[1:13:04] for the ram was slain of Mount Moriah
[1:13:07] but at the Temple mount the lamb is not
[1:13:09] slain Jesus was slain
[1:13:12] here
[1:13:15] but what happens in the temple the cloud
[1:13:17] appears in the temple
[1:13:19] what happened in Genesis 22 was not a
[1:13:22] lamb was a ram
[1:13:24] a ram is Av the thickness of a cloud
[1:13:27] and here the scripture says and Abram
[1:13:31] called the name of that place Jehovah
[1:13:33] Jireh as it is said to this day in the
[1:13:36] Mount of the Lord it shall be seen
[1:13:39] what is sin there's a temple built on
[1:13:41] the exact same place
[1:13:43] the exact same place the cloud descends
[1:13:46] and rests Beyond the Veil
[1:13:48] take the bride reads the same scripture
[1:13:50] today
[1:13:52] we'll read it like this and the scene of
[1:13:54] Abraham
[1:13:55] call the name of this place
[1:13:58] Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day
[1:14:01] in the Mount of the Lord mount Sun said
[1:14:04] it shall be seen
[1:14:08] God has provided himself a sacrifice
[1:14:11] this day
[1:14:12] we'll received a Capstone message
[1:14:15] Jehovah Jireh is manifested to his
[1:14:18] reveal word in this day
[1:14:20] Jehovah Jireh has made a provision for
[1:14:22] the bride this day
[1:14:24] we were laid on the denominational
[1:14:26] man-made cross
[1:14:28] the destined for Spiritual death
[1:14:32] but Jehovah Jireh made a provision he
[1:14:35] come himself in this hour
[1:14:37] he become that rejected word this hour
[1:14:40] he become the bleeding word this hour
[1:14:43] God provided himself a ram
[1:14:47] and because jovajara has made the
[1:14:49] provision we have passed from Death To
[1:14:52] Life
[1:14:54] eternal life we have gone past the
[1:14:57] denominational Veil we have crossed over
[1:14:59] on the other side with ram says we have
[1:15:02] broken past tradition we have come into
[1:15:04] the promise word for age
[1:15:08] like Isaac passed on dead unto life
[1:15:10] we the two seed apart from debt to
[1:15:13] eternal life
[1:15:14] we are passed from denominational
[1:15:16] Darkness to the bright light
[1:15:19] the same Cloud the Bible says that gave
[1:15:22] light to Israel
[1:15:24] put Darkness upon Egypt
[1:15:26] we have come out of the doctors of Egypt
[1:15:29] and we are walking in the light of the
[1:15:31] cloud we are walking in the light of the
[1:15:34] bride's light this hour
[1:15:36] the logos himself the word is here and
[1:15:39] he's God's perfect provision for us
[1:15:41] today
[1:15:42] when we lay down the denominational
[1:15:44] cross he said I'll provide myself
[1:15:46] a ram for the Bride of Jesus Christ they
[1:15:49] won't die the spiritual death they won't
[1:15:52] die in darkness but I'll provide a light
[1:15:54] for them I'll provide a way for the
[1:15:56] Bride of Jesus Christ This Day
[1:15:58] we can take Genesis 22.
[1:16:01] Abraham and the Mount of Mariah and we
[1:16:04] can say this day this scripture Genesis
[1:16:07] 22 is fulfilled in our lives
[1:16:11] Jehovah Jireh was made a provision
[1:16:14] himself coming down a mighty Angel
[1:16:17] declaring to this Prophet it is I am
[1:16:20] said it is
[1:16:23] six seals that reveal himself but the
[1:16:26] seven seal brings him back to Earth
[1:16:28] it is our Lord up there it's God's
[1:16:31] perfect provision
[1:16:33] Jehovah the one that exists and wants to
[1:16:36] reveal himself the one that sees and
[1:16:39] sees to it and provides for it God's
[1:16:42] provision was the word the logos himself
[1:16:45] God become the word the logos himself
[1:16:48] God become flesh the lamb 2000 years ago
[1:16:51] and God himself comes this day as a ram
[1:16:54] to make an appropriation of our sin
[1:16:57] again
[1:16:57] take us out of spiritual darkness and
[1:17:00] spiritual death into eternal life is
[1:17:03] Jehovah Jireh to the bright today
[1:17:05] himself has come not left it for someone
[1:17:08] else but he's come to deliver the Bride
[1:17:11] of Jesus Christ and now what is he given
[1:17:14] us he's given us his own word that is
[1:17:17] being made flesh
[1:17:19] he didn't give us any kind of word he
[1:17:22] gave us the word that was there in the
[1:17:23] original
[1:17:26] the original word is the spoken word
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:30] and now the books that we are reading is
[1:17:32] not a coincidence it's called a spoken
[1:17:34] word of God
[1:17:36] means that God has put back into the
[1:17:38] church the spoken word again
[1:17:40] has made a provision for us brothers and
[1:17:43] sisters and restoration this morning
[1:17:45] shall we all stand
[1:17:50] I land over to God Seven
[1:18:11] hallelujah amen you appreciate the word
[1:18:13] of the Lord amen hallelujah surely we
[1:18:16] can Rejoice around the things of God and
[1:18:18] the revealed word for the hour amen
[1:18:21] hallelujah you know the prophet they
[1:18:23] were baffled
[1:18:24] at this cloud and nobody else could
[1:18:27] explain the cloud
[1:18:28] nobody else could explain this
[1:18:31] amen they took it to scientists
[1:18:34] nobody could explain it even now it
[1:18:37] remains a mystery
[1:18:39] amen but the prophet explained it amen
[1:18:43] Oral Roberts didn't explain it Billy
[1:18:46] Graham didn't explain it but William
[1:18:48] Branham explained it and they said why
[1:18:50] don't you go down to the scientists and
[1:18:52] tell them he said it's not for them he
[1:18:54] says don't take your pearls and cast it
[1:18:56] before swines they won't believe it
[1:18:58] anyway amen hallelujah
[1:19:00] so this the reason why
[1:19:03] This Cloud existed there where there was
[1:19:05] no moisture this is not a rain cloud
[1:19:08] this is seven angels that formed the
[1:19:11] cloud
[1:19:12] and the prophet of God says that the
[1:19:14] Angels himself was his wig
[1:19:16] amen hallelujah and that's where we were
[1:19:19] in that story of Genesis 18. remember it
[1:19:22] comes with two parts now so the message
[1:19:23] fits in properly there amen
[1:19:26] first he comes to Abraham and Sarah to
[1:19:28] tell them they're going to bring forth
[1:19:29] the Son and the second part of Genesis
[1:19:31] 18 he's going down his judge to Sodom
[1:19:34] and Gomorrah amen so the prophet says
[1:19:37] there's three things that lay before us
[1:19:38] now amen hallelujah in the anointed ones
[1:19:41] at the end time and he talks about these
[1:19:43] three things that lay before us now
[1:19:45] Sodom amen the Earth is in a certain
[1:19:47] condition
[1:19:48] amen he says Janice and jamaris are
[1:19:51] rising up again
[1:19:52] amen and isn't it strange that now in a
[1:19:55] certain condition they are talking about
[1:19:57] new bodies in a perverted form they're
[1:20:00] not happy with their body
[1:20:02] they're talking about body change that's
[1:20:04] the trans movement now
[1:20:06] they want a body change
[1:20:08] so that in a perverted way they are
[1:20:10] talking about body change they're not
[1:20:12] happy in their own body
[1:20:13] but it's a perversion of us and the
[1:20:16] expectation for our new body
[1:20:18] amen hallelujah and I'm glad that the
[1:20:21] Bible called him a ram because a lamb
[1:20:24] could be male or female right
[1:20:26] [Laughter]
[1:20:28] but when he said a ram
[1:20:30] amen hallelujah a ram is a male
[1:20:34] amen Jesus Christ
[1:20:36] amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:20:39] and then Revelation 10 7 when he shall
[1:20:42] begin to sound not she
[1:20:44] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:20:46] of God will be finished amen so some
[1:20:49] wonderful thoughts amen we can go on and
[1:20:51] on just uh elaborating on those thoughts
[1:20:53] but really appreciate the word of the
[1:20:54] Lord let's give the Lord a good answer
[1:20:55] of risk amen one of the beautiful
[1:20:58] thoughts that I had there was when the
[1:21:00] brother was preaching amen and he's
[1:21:01] talking about how God when he has a uh
[1:21:04] his first thought is a perfect thought
[1:21:06] amen he said what it's the first
[1:21:09] decision is the perfect decision the
[1:21:11] first thought is a perfect thought now
[1:21:14] when you are thinking about the Redeemer
[1:21:16] would the Redeemer be the first thought
[1:21:18] or the one who's Fallen be the first
[1:21:20] thought
[1:21:23] why would you have need of a redeemer
[1:21:26] if there's nobody to be redeemed
[1:21:28] what's it saying brother Joshua is
[1:21:30] telling me last week
[1:21:31] Redemption is for
[1:21:34] you you were giving me a nice saying
[1:21:36] there last week
[1:21:37] hey
[1:21:38] yeah yeah creation and Redemption
[1:21:41] Redemption amen God created the Earth
[1:21:44] God created the Redeemer to redeem us so
[1:21:47] who would he have thought of first
[1:21:50] when he had thoughts of Jesus Christ
[1:21:52] because we are part of him he had to
[1:21:54] think of us
[1:21:55] so we were part of first thoughts
[1:21:57] so that's why I'm saying you had a
[1:21:58] perfect thought
[1:22:00] greet your brother and sister and say
[1:22:01] God bless you perfect thought
[1:22:04] you're a perfect thought amen
[1:22:07] some of you are husbands telling your
[1:22:09] wives that and they're like yo
[1:22:12] perfect thought amen amen amen he knew
[1:22:16] me yet he loved me amen what a glorious
[1:22:19] father this is and that's why the Bride
[1:22:21] Can Rejoice you know we've we've gotten
[1:22:23] so accustomed it's been a long time that
[1:22:25] we just fellowshipping around the
[1:22:27] message of the hour that we've forgotten
[1:22:28] where God took us from this
[1:22:30] denominational rut filth
[1:22:33] amen where they crucified the word
[1:22:35] they've gone for Creeds and dogmas amen
[1:22:38] they lay aside the scriptures you show
[1:22:40] them baptism they don't want to believe
[1:22:41] it you show them goddess they don't want
[1:22:43] to believe it you show them no women
[1:22:44] preachers they don't want to believe it
[1:22:46] but we have been restored back to the
[1:22:48] original word
[1:22:50] amen and the Bible says heavens and
[1:22:52] earth will pass away but my word will
[1:22:54] never pass away
[1:22:56] you look up to the first Bible the
[1:22:57] zodiac is still there
[1:23:00] you look to the second Bible the pyramid
[1:23:02] in spite of the flood the pyramid still
[1:23:04] stands the pyramid Woods to the flood
[1:23:06] because that was God's second Bible
[1:23:08] and this is God's written form of the
[1:23:11] Bible now these heavens and earth will
[1:23:13] pass away but his word all three forms
[1:23:15] are here
[1:23:16] the heavens the pyramid and the Bible
[1:23:19] and now all of that the word has become
[1:23:22] flesh in you and me amen amen they don't
[1:23:24] have to look to the heavens anymore
[1:23:26] they don't have to look to the pyramid
[1:23:28] anymore
[1:23:29] and the prophet says sometimes they
[1:23:31] don't even have a bible to read but when
[1:23:32] they look at you
[1:23:33] they look at me it's the only Bible they
[1:23:36] will ever read so how much we ought to
[1:23:38] say Lord Make Me In Your image amen
[1:23:40] let's sing be it unto me according to
[1:23:42] Thy word amen we can find it out there
[1:23:44] in the woods amen be it unto me
[1:23:47] that's what Mary said you know I was
[1:23:49] thinking Mary is really a beautiful name
[1:23:53] but nobody really names their daughters
[1:23:55] Mary I wonder why
[1:23:58] but it's a beautiful name brother Caleb
[1:24:00] if you're looking for a name
[1:24:03] amen Mary the then the prophet saying
[1:24:07] pick up your pen and write as the word
