[0:00] and tonight we're starting on the sixth
[0:03] chapter of
[0:04] Revelation now as we study this chapter
[0:08] we're referring different places even to
[0:10] Old and New Testament alike because the
[0:14] entire book is the revelation of Jesus
[0:17] Christ amen that's all together the
[0:19] revelation of of the Lord Jesus the
[0:22] revelation of Jesus Christ it's God
[0:26] revealing himself in the book revealing
[0:30] himself through Christ in the book and
[0:34] Christ is the revelation of God Amen he
[0:37] come to reveal God because he and God
[0:40] were the same God was in Christ
[0:43] reconciling the world to himself you see
[0:47] the book actually was planned and
[0:51] written before the foundation of the
[0:54] world Amen this book The Bible was
[1:00] really written before the foundation of
[1:02] the world and Christ being the lamb was
[1:06] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:09] and the the members of his bride their
[1:13] names were put in the Lamb's Book of
[1:15] Life before the foundational world but
[1:19] it's been sealed
[1:21] up and now it's being
[1:25] revealed whose names were in there all
[1:29] about it what a great thing and there
[1:32] about 12:00 in the day the Holy Spirit
[1:35] just swept right down into the room and
[1:37] the whole thing is opened up to me
[1:42] there of this of this first seal being
[1:46] open I'm as positive as I'm standing
[1:49] here tonight that this is the gospel
[1:52] truth that I'm going to
[1:55] say now we find the Lamb with the book
[1:59] now
[2:00] and now in the sixth chapter we
[2:04] read and I saw when the lamb opened one
[2:07] of the seals and I heard as it were the
[2:10] noise of a
[2:12] thunder and one of the four Beast saying
[2:16] Comm and seed and I saw and behold a
[2:19] white horse and he is set on him had a
[2:22] bow and a crown was given unto him and
[2:26] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[2:30] but it isn't this kind of a book it's a
[2:33] scroll and then when the scroll is
[2:35] Unwound that's one that land right in
[2:38] the scroll is number two and right here
[2:40] says what it is but it's a mystery so a
[2:44] revelation is something that's made
[2:47] known of something something that's been
[2:50] revealed and now notice so you once
[2:54] forget it it is closed up until the
[3:00] latter
[3:01] [Music]
[3:03] time the whole mystery of it is closed
[3:06] up until the latter times we find that
[3:10] in the scripture here now the mystery of
[3:13] the book are revealed when the seals are
[3:17] broken and when the seals completely are
[3:20] broken the time of redemption is over
[3:23] because the lamb left the intercession
[3:26] boat to walk out to take his clean he
[3:29] was a mediator between that but when the
[3:32] real Revelation happens on the seals as
[3:35] they begin to break the lamb is coming
[3:38] forth from the sanctuary now he said
[3:41] there is a white harsh Rider but what
[3:45] the mystery of it is there a mystery
[3:47] that goes with that Rider now what it
[3:50] was they didn't know but it's to be
[3:52] revealed and I saw when the lamb opened
[3:57] one of the seed wonder what that Thunder
[4:00] was St John 12 chapter and just hold it
[4:04] a minute St John the 12th chapter when
[4:08] the Thunder remember a loud clapping
[4:12] noise of a thunder is a voice of God the
[4:16] first seal when it was open in the
[4:20] symbol form it thunder and what about
[4:23] when it's open his reality form it's
[4:26] thundered as soon as the lamb struck
[4:29] back to Sea
[4:30] and what did it reveal not all of itself
[4:33] first it's to God next it's in the symol
[4:37] then it's reveal three things and only
[4:39] it to be revealed at the last day when
[4:42] this actual seal is
[4:44] broken broken to who not to Christ but
[4:47] to the
[4:48] church oh my that just makes me tremble
[4:52] I'm on a thunder trap no doubt John
[4:54] might have jumped up in the air one of
[4:57] thunder roars and then one of the four
[4:59] people he said now come see what it is
[5:03] what's revealed the
[5:06] [Music]
[5:07] oh John write what you see so John goes
[5:12] to look see what it was John goes to see
[5:16] what the Thunder said it's then that
[5:19] this creature told John come see what
[5:23] the mystery is under the first
[5:26] seal the Thunder the voice of the
[5:29] creator has uttered it now what does
[5:32] this White Horse me and he that sat on
[5:35] him had a
[5:37] bow and a crown was given him he didn't
[5:40] have it
[5:41] then unto him and he went forth
[5:44] conquering and to conquer now what does
[5:46] the white horse mean now here's where
[5:48] the Revelation comes but my Revelation
[5:53] by the holy spirit is not that way my
[5:56] Revelation by the holy spirit is Christ
[5:59] and and the Holy Spirit is the
[6:02] self-signed
[6:04] person owning a different farm so here
[6:07] stands Christ the lamb we know he was
[6:10] the lamb he stand here at the books in
[6:12] his hand and there goes the white horse
[6:13] rider so it wasn't the Holy Spirit and
[6:17] so how could Christ be out there the
[6:20] White Horse conquering and standing here
[6:21] with a book in his hand it isn't th it
[6:25] isn't Christ
[6:27] notice now the holy spirit in the
[6:31] Revelation and Christ is the holy spirit
[6:34] is Christ in another form right notice
[6:39] it is the Lamb that open the
[6:42] books and the lamb is
[6:45] Christ and Christ is not seen
[6:49] anymore from then but he is seen in the
[6:53] Book of Revelations the 19th Chapter
[6:56] coming on a white heart amen and he that
[7:00] set on him was called faithful true
[7:03] righteous does he judge and make walk
[7:06] his eyes were flames of fire and on his
[7:09] head was many crowns look at the diadem
[7:13] and he had a name written that no man
[7:15] know but himself I
[7:18] notied no man know but himself and he
[7:21] was clothed with the vesture di and
[7:24] blood and his name is called the word of
[7:26] God notice and the army
[7:30] which were in heaven followed him upon
[7:32] white horses clothed in fine linen white
[7:35] and clean and out of his mouth goes a
[7:37] sharp sword that with it he should Smite
[7:41] the Nations and he shall rule them with
[7:43] a rod of iron and he tread The Wine
[7:47] Press of the fierceness of the wrath of
[7:49] almighty God and he had on his vesture
[7:52] and on his by a name written king of
[7:56] kings and Lord of lords there comes the
[8:00] Messiah there he is not this fell on
[8:02] this horse back here
[8:05] notice the rider on the White Horse
[8:08] don't have any name you might used two
[8:11] three
[8:13] titles but he hasn't got any name but
[8:16] Christ has the
[8:18] name what is it the word of
[8:21] God in the beginning was the word the
[8:23] word is with God and the Word was God
[8:26] and the word made
[8:28] flesh the rer has no name but Christ is
[8:32] called the word of God who is this
[8:35] mysterious Rider of the first church age
[8:39] you want me tell you who he is he's the
[8:41] Antichrist exactly what he is now
[8:45] because you see if an antichrist Jesus
[8:49] said that the two would be so close
[8:52] together and so it would deceive the
[8:53] very elected the bride if it was
[8:56] possible Antichrist it's the anti Christ
[8:59] Spirit Glory notice and when this holy
[9:04] spirit that we have becomes incarnate to
[9:08] us the one that's in our midst now the
[9:10] form of the Holy Ghost becomes incarnate
[9:13] to us in the person of Jesus Christ we
[9:15] don't
[9:17] [Applause]
[9:18] [Music]
[9:20] King right what are we saying who is
[9:23] this Rider this horse rider you know
[9:26] what it is it's Satan's super educ
[9:30] this is a Satan Superman with education
[9:33] with wisdom with church Theology of his
[9:37] own word of his own making and he rides
[9:39] his white denominational horse to
[9:42] deceive the people and the Antichrist
[9:45] takes it all and the Bible said that he
[9:49] deceived all
[9:51] ainel all upon the face of the Earth
[9:55] whose names were not written under those
[9:57] Shields from the
[10:01] now notice he'll conquer and almost has
[10:06] in his grip right now while he's still
[10:08] Antichrist before he can become Thief
[10:10] may be one thing that can conquer those
[10:12] that's got their names written in the
[10:13] L's Book of Life from the foundation of
[10:15] the
[10:16] world I notice and the same time this is
[10:20] going on just before this takes place
[10:22] rather on the earth God has promised
[10:27] while all them Scruples of denom
[10:29] minations arguing their difference about
[10:31] the
[10:32] Creed God promised that he would send us
[10:35] a true prophet of the true word with a
[10:39] message to return to the original word
[10:42] of God and the faith of the fathers to
[10:44] bring down the power of the Holy Ghost
[10:46] amongst the people with a power that
