precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah what a privilege to come back in the house of the Lord to worship him and give him praise amen amen let's go to our Bibles even as we go to the word of the lord we go to Genesis chapter 1 amen so if you were here last week you would hear amen the different ministers were preaching on the cloud amen and they were showing you how the cloud in the Old Testament the cloud in amen was there for 6 days on the mountain and then on the seventh day amen Moses went up into the cloud he was caught up into the cloud and then we see brother brandham amen the cloud was year for 6 days and then on the seventh day he was caught up into the cloud amen amen am Hallelujah so there was a purpose for that amen and we know the cloud is not a water vapor Cloud hallelujah amen the cloud is the prophet is tying up now you remember what he said if the vision is scriptural it must be interpreted by scripture so being a scriptural prophet he goes to the scripture and he takes Revelation 10 to interpret the vision that he had about seven angels coming to him amen amen praise the Lord thank you L amen so we'll read here in Genesis chapter 1 amen we got to look at the origin of man maybe you're asking why you so fixated on men why you keep because we are men yes amen you know if you lost something you'll spend day and night to get back to what you lost am amen so where we are right now we're not in our ought to be condition amen and I think some times the channels get clogged up because there's a difference between the Genesis one man that God made and what we call today as human that's an Earthly thing that these people put a name to call us human there's nothing human about us you know we when we talk to one another we also try and find sympathy with it and we say oh I'm only human I'm subject to faults and mistakes who told you that you're human amen amen amen you're talking the the language of the world Amen you're a son and daughter of the most high God amen amen and that's why I'm saying our language needs to change amen everything about us needs to change to realize that we are made you know the prophet says if you take a a teaspoon of the ocean everything that's in that deep ocean day is in that teaspoon amen so we reading the quotes about how you rotated off of the eternal spirit when God created you amen the spirit man so you are have the same attributes the same substance the same material as God Amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah thank you Lord amen and I pray that Revelation really opens up to us thank then we move away from the carnality of life amen when we realize who we are to be then Romans 8 will become more clear to us where it says we are groaning within ourselves amen longing to go back to our first estate amen amen Hallelujah I know some of you want to believe that amen God had made you just to be a human mortal being on the Earth but God made you to be a God on the earth amen that's right Genesis 1:26 so God is finishing creating all all of creation he comes now and he says let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over the Earth Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so notice the first part if he's going to make Man In His Image and after his likeness he needs to use the god substance the god material yeah he's not going to the ground yet can you say amen amen can somebody believe that yes amen yeah he's saying let us make man in our image if God wants to make Man In His Image he must use the same substance he must use if he wants to make him in the same likeness he must use the same substance then he gives him Dominion 27 so God created man so first he asks the question now watch many trinitarians think they got us there by saying when he says let us make man right but watch 27 puts it in context and it speaks of God singular amen amen created Man In His Image not their image In His Image in his own image in the image of God created him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said un unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth amen amen you see who God is giving Dominion to he's not saying I'm going to control these things I'm placing you man to have dominion amen amen hallelujah and you must be fruitful amen amen so God has it in his mind that this man must reproduce himself and God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the all the Earth every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and to every foul of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the Earth Earth wherein there is life I have given every green herb for meat and so it was and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day amen you may be seated the Lord at blessings to the reading of his word so if God intended this man to have dominion over the Earth how is he going to control the Earth so the power of the spoken word amen amen amen you remember now brother random after the seals he's speaking on Amen that the spoken word is the Original Seed amen The Original Seed in the beginning was God's spoken word let there be so if God made this man after his own substance after his own Essence his own character his own nature this man possesses the ability to speak amen amen amen let's go to our next scripture we'll go to Psalm 115 amen so we always say God is God of the heavens and man is God on the earth that's how God intended it to be amen so we take the scripture here in Psalm 115 and we'll see here Amen in verse 16 it says the heaven even the heavens are the Lords but the Earth at he given to the children of men amen amen amen the Earth is given to the children of men now those are sons of Adam amen so we find here amen let me ask you this question before we continue are you satisfied with your current condition as a son and daughter of God are you where you ought to be spiritually in your growth and journey in Life or do you desire more amen amen so if God had to call you home today are you satisfied that you have fulfilled the purpose of God amen or will you say Lord I just need a few more years to put myself in order put things right amen amen what would it be because we ought to be ready at all times amen amen amen we something is definitely wrong because it can't be 60 years after the prophet brings such a powerful word to the Earth word that is perfect word that is here to produce a perfect faith in a people that all that he prophesied about the people of God that those people are not in alignment with what he spoke that's right then there's got to be a problem and like we've been doing spiritual Diagnostics and we realize amen that in order to get the glory back you've got to connect with the angel of God amen amen yes amen you've got to be able to connect with the angel of God in order to be able to operate as a son and daughter of God in this time and season we have beautiful sermons which we might call sermons but they were truths spoken to us these are the divinely revealed mystery truths yes amen amen so these mystery truths that were revealed to us were not just beautiful sermons but it was Amen to take away our IIA yes to make us recognize who we are as Sons and Daughters of God to make us realize that we are not just mortal mere mortal men but we are supernatural beings amen amen amen hallelujah therefore as supernatural beings we take control over every situation in our lives amen we take dominion over every situation amen hallelujah so God does not want us to stay in the condition that we are in right God wants us to progress and come up higher in the things of God come up higher in our Revelation come up higher in our spiritual walk with him amen until we become amen so full the prophet says amen that you become a Powerhouse of God Amen a living Tabernacle of the most high God so we find the glory what we just read there now the glory was given to men yes that is why Satan comes into the garden because because he sees the glory of God in this man he see this man with the possesses the ability to speak you remember Satan wanted to be like the most high God and now he's a man on the earth like the most high God Amen Hallelujah so God had made a man in His image and his likeness but Satan wanted to make a man in after his image he wants to make a man after the image of the Beast oh thank you Jesus so say comes knowing that he can use the body of the serpent to infiltrate the the plan there and he he takes the body of the serpent he incarnates The Serpent and he injects his seed into the human race yes that's what's called The Serpent seed yes amen but when this fall happens you find the curse the glory is taken from man eternal life is taken from man man loses his Godlike qualities amen amen hallelujah so this is now fallen man these are sons of Adam who can never redeem themselves that's right because no man is found worthy no none of the sons of Adam were found worthy to bring Redemption back to man right amen amen they tried to find it through the prophets amen but each one of them had their weaknesses amen each one of them typed Christ in part but all of them had weaknesses that they could could not fully Express the glory of God through their lives so if the glory is taken away from man and like the prophet says he calls it the title deed the title deed to man's inheritance which is eternal life the power of the earth power over the Earth amen and fellowship with God this is taken away from man the title deed to the Earth and It Go the prophet says Satan can't take it that's amen he's not authorized to take it so the book has to go back to the original owner yes amen amen and that's God Almighty amen but God knows that the book does not belong in heaven oh that's right the authority over the Earth does not belong in heaven yes it belongs to the Earth yes amen amen it belongs to man amen hallelujah hallelujah so we find here remember God is Not defeated in his purpose God now allowed this and he gave made man with the ability to choose so he gave man the ability to choose and that choice amen is what Satan worked with he used doubt and he used reasoning yes and he came through the woman and he deceived the woman amen hallelujah and that's how he swed his seed into the human race and that's how the glory was taken away from man and you find that God put a cherubim there with a flaming sword so that man could not he says if man took from the the tree of good and evil man can now take from the Tree of Life but God does not want man to have eternal life in a fallen State amen so he protects the way to the tree of life amen yes so man can't regain his glory yes he's got to wait for the appointed time and the appointed season oh yes amen praise the Lord man has got to wait for the appointed time and the appointed season amen when somebody will be found worthy to bring back man's inheritance to the Earth amen yes Lord thank you amen I want you to know that you are not in you ought to be conditioned you the family that you were born in is not amen you ought to be conditioned amen hallelujah that is God's permissive will that you came through a sex body amen but the real you I'm talking on the inside of you you possess a seed gen Gene of God within you a germ of God within you amen a soul that God put within you and only you can be reborn when Jesus said you must be born again he's talking about people who have the C Gene of God within them not everybody can be born again there are millions of Christians but they are not born again brother brand says only those who they have SE Gene of God within them can be reborn give God praise amen that's predestination for you thank you Lord yes amen so no matter how much they they toy with the idea you must be born again be born again born again they cannot be born again because they don't have the Gene within them only Sons and Daughters can be reborn thank you amen now you know why Jesus said all that the father has given me will come to me and not one of them is lost amen hallelujah these scriptures are there amen and when you try to show people predestination they don't want to believe it amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord amen aren't you glad that not one of you you is lost amen amen you might grope around in sin for a while amen but if you're an attribute of God Amen if you came from the back part of God's mind amen you're going to burst through every sin you're going to burst through every unbelief amen you're going to come forth in this time and season and take your place as a son and daughter of God on the earth amen and Satan and none of his demons can stop you from coming forth oh thank you Lord amen so we find here that 4,000 years pass and God now amen in his predes plan he knows that he can't send somebody else to the Earth amen but he's got to come back to the Earth amen and he can't work to the body of a man but he's got to create himself a body have I created amen yes amen L I come in the volume of the book amen so the word became flesh that's John 1 now the word becomes flesh and it dwells amongst us amen and when you're looking at Jesus you are seeing the type of man that we ought to be amen because Jesus did not buypass his theophany amen hallelujah you are seeing a God man you are seeing a man in control of creation you are seeing a man who can restore man the eyesight because he has the authority on the earth he can speak to winds he can speak to waves amen he can multiply Fish and Loaves he has complete dominion over the Earth amen amen amen creative power is locked up in this man because the fullness of God was in Jesus Christ yes he dwelt in him bodily amen so when they looked at this man they had never known a man like this so they start to question what manner of man is this that even the winds the waves the Seas obey him we don't know about this kind of man and in this 21st century they still don't know about this kind of a man because this kind of man is on the Earth again Mark 11:23 man a man who possesses the power to speak over situations a man who is able to believe his own word and not doubt his own word that man is back on the Earth again amen give God praise amen they didn't understand it back then they had the question back then what manner of man is this and they still have the question here today when they see Sons and Daughters of God operate under the power and the anointing of God they say what manner of man is this amen oh thank you Lord amen hallelujah so Church what I'm trying to tell you you and I cannot be silent amen Earth responds to your voice amen Earth responds to the vibrations coming out of your mouth amen so you need to take control of every situation you need to stand up in this hour and take control of every trial every circumstance every sickness don't back down amen maintain a positive confession you may not see the result right now but remember a grain of sand is moving from the mountain keep maintaining a positive confession say Satan I will not back down I have come to take back everything that you have stolen from me my health my wealth my family my children I am taking it back in this time in this season amen cuz this is the Year of Jubilee and in the Year of Jubilee everything that was lost must be returned Amen to the original owner yes amen oh thank you Jesus and there's no bargaining in the time of Jubilee there's no bargaining to say okay I'll give it back to you if you do no if it belong to you in the time of Jubilee it must be released to you amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah yes so the glory belong to man amen and Jesus brings the glory back to the Earth yet he can't share his glory with anyone yet because he says when I go then I'll send the holy spirit amen thank you Lord amen and it seems like a clear picture receive he the Holy Ghost to receive the glory of God and come back into your original image amen amen but then the cares of Life come amen and you can't grieve the holy spirit so people choose to for a religious spirit rather than the Holy Spirit oh people choose the traditions of a messy should church amen to follow it and say we believe certain certain things but they've excluded the Holy Ghost you can live so close in the message and look so close like a message believer but not have the Holy Ghost amen amen amen amen and it behoves Us in this time amen that you must be filled with the Holy Ghost amen the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost the prophet says which we've seen work in a small measure in Amen in his own humble Ministry but he says as we now nearing The Headstone you'll see it come to its fullness thank you I ask you what are you looking for oh yes amen hallelujah are you looking for amen a bigger bank balance are you looking to secure your life here on the Earth are you looking amen what are you really looking for amen amen we are not called to be living the way that we are living amen we are called to discipleship amen we are called to be Sons and Daughters of God I ask you who are you discipling who are you speaking to amen the disciples went about witnessing amen they were not taking a message and just taking it for themselves amen the commission is going to all the world and preach the gospel amen amen than you Lord what are we doing thank you Lord are we we just to sit here in a message Church 40 years amen 50 years however it is I think we're going to get a long service award help us Lord amen we are to be stewards of the Gospel stewards of the Kingdom amen hallelujah declaring to the Next Generation the truth of what God has done for us because I tell you there's a generation coming and maybe even here in the messy church that don't even know the works that was done in the life in the ministry of the Prophet they don't know what Luke 17:13 meant they don't know what The Cloud of Glory means amen oh yes Hallelujah but who passes on the Heritage yes we've got to prophesy again amen amen we've got to prophesy amen hallelujah and make known the Deeds of God amen amen praise the Lord yes amen otherwise we can all choose to live a good you know in latest year they it's Rich it's increased with Goods yes you can if you if you put your mind to it if you go to study find a good job you can buy a home you can buy a car you can live a comfortable life but we are not called for that that's right amen amen and I pray that as I'm speaking to you tonight that there's a gene within you connecting with saying I am that man that he's talking about amen I have representation within me to know that I'm a God on the earth I'm not called to be ordinary yes amen amen I'm called for something greater amen Greater Works than these shall he doen amen said our lord Jesus so I'm called for Greater Works I'm called for greater things amen thank you Lord hallelujah so I ask you discipleship amen are you a good disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ amen or you think Jesus just said 12 and one betrayed him and now he's left with 11 and then Paul comes to replace him and then there's 12 disciples amen and you are called amen where do you find yourself in the body of Christ amen amen do you think that a 21st century disciple is not existent amen but a 21st century disciple ought to be on the scene now amen amen and we should start simple we should start small amen you can start to witness to your people and if you don't possess the power because not everyone is gifted with the word of God you tell them why don't you come with me to church yes that's right start with your cousins start with your friends start with your sister SS start with your brothers start with your nieces start with your nephews amen that's right tell them come stay over and I'll take you to church amen hallelujah start simple Yes start small amen amen start to influence your neighbors tell them you know what we've seen the power of God move amen because you remember healing is the bait we've seen the power of God move and I know amen without a shadow of doubt that the angel of God is here amen moving in a supernatural way we don't have any doubt about that amen 2023 established the angel of God back in the church amen hallelujah connected back to our rightful inheritance amen so there's no doubt there ought to be no doubt in anybody's mind about the supernatural power and the glory of God thank you thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen this year amen we are focused and what the Lord is doing in our lives is to display and manifest himself fully through us why do you think the Revelation is coming in such a strong way to tell you that you are the same substance as God Amen oh yes amen thank you Lord amen praise the Lord because he wants to manifest himself the fullness through the body of Christ am amen and we can't be slack concerning the things of God we've got to be on the Move amen amen we've got to be focused we've got to have a vision amen hallelujah even in your own lives let me ask you what Vision do you have for your life amen what purpose do you have yes the Bible says seek you first the kingdom of God young man young woman let me ask you are you seeking first the kingdom of God Amen praise the Lord are you seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness the Bible says all of these things shall be added unto you amen if you're going to look at what Jesus is talking about all of these things talking about your daily needs the cares of the life amen hallelujah amen so here comes the Lord Jesus Christ and he is the perfect sinless spotless lamb that can take away the sin of mankind amen yes because he is God in flesh and he's called the Lamb of God and John identifies him and he says Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world amen amen praise the Lord Brothers I don't think there's load sharing tonight amen but you can just check that they've suspended Shing as far as I'm I'm aware amen praise the Lord amen so behold the lamb now watch even before Jesus does anything John prophesies even before Jesus does anything yes John prophesies Behold the Lamb of God Amen that takes away the sin of the world Amen come on now yes the of Elijah is prophesying over the groom amen when you're reading William brandham the for Elijah he's looking at the bright broom and he starts to prophesy over you he says a sinless spotless amen spotless wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah she's born of his bone she's flesh of his flesh amen yes Lord amen amen thank you amen amen hallelujah when Adam looks at at Eve he identifies her he gives her her identity and he says you are me yeah you are me right he comes in this time and in this season amen and he says this bride you are me you are me reproduced on the earth you are my feminine part amen hallelujah and because the feminine part the deception came through the feminine part in the beginning I'm going to have the feminine part on display at the end and this one will not fall by reasoning this one will not doubt the word amen this one will stay true to the word amen Satan will come and try at every point but this one will be Resolute on the word it is written it is written it is written amen this one is established on the word of God Amen this one is established on the mechanics amen and this one has the Dynamics amen that has come upon the mechanics to make it live amen so that Satan can reason with this the written word because she is the manifested word amen because the words have moved from out the pages of the book and now when you're looking at me and you you are seeing the word on display amen you are seeing a product of the word amen hallelujah no longer just a written word amen but now moved into tablets of Flesh amen amen hallelujah when I look at you I'm looking at the manifested word I'm looking at prophecy hallelujah amen so when very quickly now Jesus comes there and he pays the price for Redemption but that's paying the price for Redemption laying down his very own life amen but Redemption all also requires just not only just paying the price but it also requires the the claiming part yes amen amen so now remember a man needs to get to to Heaven yes where's the book Amen in heaven yes Revelation 4 you go and see it there amen one sitting on the throne he's got the book yes what is the book the title deed to man's inheritance but now there's no man on the earth that can go up to heaven except the man amen thank you Lord so he comes amen he you know he died they killed him on a Roman cross on a Roman Tree amen hallelujah they put him on a tree because man stole from the tree amen they put a crown of thorns on his head because that was part of the curse yes the thorns and thistles oh yes am amen so he's basically taking the curse upon himself Wonder amen he's literally taking the curse upon himself amen and he's put on display he dies amen but he prophesies about his own death and he says bury this temp amen put this temple in the ground after 3 days I'll raise it up amen so we know what Jesus does Amen if we know amen that you can go and read in tement and all these messages and the prophet will tell you exactly what Jesus Does on the ministry the ministry in the grave how he goes down there to the souls that are imprisoned amen and he preaches to them those Souls Amen in Noah's day and how they rejected the message and he goes to present the gospel to them and then how he takes the keys of death hell and the grave amen he gives Satan a great big kick amen and then he ascends and he goes to the paradise and then he empties out paradise amen hallelujah amen amen and then on the third day Jesus Christ Our Lord and our savior he rises triumphantly from the grave right amen no other man did that I have power to lay my life down I have power to raise it up again amen hallelujah the gospel of the Cross is so powerful the gospel of the Cross amen still stands strong today it still stands as a testament amen of our living through God yes amen amen we are to Rejoice about the cross amen we ought to Rejoice about the res ction of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen no other person can boast about that amen hallelujah and if you know amen when he died I died when he rose I Rose amen and that's his empty grave there in Israel but that's also my empty grave because I shall never be confound to a grave amen amen amen Ain't No Grave oh yes going to hold this body down oh a no No Grave going to hold his body down amen can't keep me down that's right amen hallelujah demons are raging back at you you tell them please be still amen amen praise the Lord you know Satan want to wipe you out in an instant but the angels of God encamped around you you fear the Lord in this hour amen amen amen amen God has a work for you to do Satan can't take your life prematurely Satan can't touch your life amen amen if he wants to touch your life he's got to wait in que like he did in job's time and then he's going to ask permission yes amen you know who you are you're B with a price amen you belong to the Lord God Almighty don't keep confessing oh Satan is after to me the devil's after me what's all these things talk she's after you you you got Devils on the run you confessing those things you know what the devils are confessing they screaming and shouting for their lives and they're saying that guy's got me on the Run move move move he's cast me out I'm looking for another body amen don't adopt language of humans that's right oh thank you Lord amen know who you are amen Shake It Off The Prophet says he comes to give you any sickness amen you say Return to Sender don't sign for anything amen amen he's got a box of rattlesnakes there he's got a box of sickness amen tell them you dumb lying demon I do not have that I declare amen take it back amen your lie came from the pit of Hell so take the sickness back with you to Hell amen and you got to realize you possess the power to bind amen whatever you bind on Earth is bound in heaven and you got the power to cast out I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy so when he comes to present things before you you got to bind him amen and then cast him out am amen and instruct him do not return back to the house sir amen I'm trying to place the authority back in you to show you that The Cloud of Glory that we are talking about that God had sent back the glory down to the Earth but this Glory was for a specific time and for a specific season but I'm preaching to connect to people who can recognize and see themselves as part of that people amen amen hallelujah I'm looking for that se genene within you amen and I'm preaching to that se Gene within you to take away the Amnesia and tell you who you are yes amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen I am looking now the Holy Ghost is going forth searching the Earth for for those Sons and Daughters of God that he had kept back for a specific time for a specific season Sons and Daughters of God that will connect with the anointing in the hour that will rise above their circumstance and say that's me amen thank you blessed be your name not have faith today and then tomorrow you don't have faith when you see a symptom amen but stand immovable amen hallelujah say it is finished amen by the stripes of Jesus I am healed amen the blood of Jesus cleanses me from all sin we can't be struggling now with issues about amen our past condemnation and our past sins amen hallelujah there is therefore now no condemnation thank you Lord to them which walk after the spirit and not up to the flesh amen oh yes amen we ought to be gone past those things Satan keeping you down in condemnation Satan keeping you down in fear telling you you're not good enough telling you you're always a failure amen you are listening to the devil's lie listen to the word of God that tells you you're a son and daughter of God Amen rise above your situation amen amen don't don't look at your amen whatever you see however you see yourself and measure yourself but the way you see yourself measure Yourself by the way the word of God sees you oh Hallelujah stop to believe in yourself say I am more than enough amen God had placed within me the His Holy Spirit and great is he that is within me than he that's in the world Hallelujah you Lord praise the Lord thank

Hallelujah yes amen thank you Lord yes thank you Lord they say they're going to fire you amen what you scared about his word amen know your worth know your value know who you are thank you Lord amen hallelujah praise the lord lord so yeah the Lord takes a man needs to get to heaven to bring the title deed back to the Earth yes amen so the only one now that raises up triumphantly on the third day is our Lord Jesus Christ and after 40 days he ascends to heaven and the angels tell him the same Cloud that you see take him up yes in the way that you seen him go up in the same way in like manner he shall return amen now however if you know if you understand the mystery about the cloud you would know amen that that cloud is talking about seven angels I'm looking for Faith connectors now amen that cloud is talking about seven angels the cloud that came down in Mount Transfiguration was seven angels the cloud that came and overshadowed Mount Si was Angels amen oh come on F connectors amen yes amen we aren't dealing with M clouds here amen we're talking about supernatural amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord so the Lord God Almighty amen Jesus Christ the man the perfect man goes to heaven and now you'll see there in the fth chapter of Revelation the man they're looking for the man now remember very important here John is in Revelation chapter 5 John is a type of the bride and he's observing the sin yeah and he is watching that now there's a book in the hand of the one that is Seated on the throne yes and a strong Angel if you go and look at that word it's a mighty Angel yes proclaims who is worthy Amen to take the book it's now after seven Church ages remember they couldn't find Jesus because he was in the sanctuary he's the high priest am amen making intercession that's now Revelation chapter 1 the one in the midst of seven golden candlesticks amen hallelujah so they Search Heaven they search the Earth they even search beneath the Earth meaning the realm of the Dead to find a man who's worthy to bring back the glory down to man to bring back man's inheritance so that he can possess the power of the spoken word yes amen so that he can possess eternal life he can possess fellowship with God yes yes amen and dominion over the Earth but there's nobody found worthy including John who is the bride yes amen if you read the breach message you'll see where brother Brandon talks about what the book actually is amen it's a book of redemption it's a titled deed of man's inheritance and it says it's traced all the way back to the original owner amen meaning that there's no other ears you see you see there in El's inheritance what was Boaz doing he was redeeming elc's inheritance but there was a nearer Kinsman amen amen amen but he did not want to take responsibility to redeem elc's inheritance right so he goes before the elders yes this is what is happening in Revelation 5 now Jesus before the elders Elders if you read Revelation 5 you'll see the elders are there yes amen so it's Boaz going before the elders and you know he takes his sandal and he beats it amen hallelujah amen and he says let it be known today that I am redeeming elc's inheritance that's Nomi and together with Nomi his a daughter-in-law ruthen yes that's right yes so Satan can't redeem this book in heaven you can't bring the glory back to the Earth John can't do it the 24 Elders can't do it the Beast can't do it the angels in heaven can't do it but they can't find one worthy so you got to ask yourself if they searched Heaven they searched Earth they search beneath the Earth why couldn't they find Jesus because Jesus is a now called the high priest after the order of MDC and you know the high priest when he went into the sanctuary nobody could go into the Sanctuary they had to wait for the priest to come back out that is why they could not find Jesus amen they had to wait for seven Church ages to finish when he asked to make intercession for seven Church ages make an atonement for seven Church ages amen by the end of the seventh Church age he is coming back out from the sanctuary amen amen because he had to make intercession for every name that was in the book yes because he's now taking you from the L from The Book of Life remember through your natural birth you came in The Book of Life yes and he's transferring you to the lamb section Hallelujah putting you back in your original position oh yes amen you see in the Book of Life all man born of a woman can appear there but in the Lamb's Book of Life the lamb section it's only his redeemable attributes that are found in the lamb section of the book of life amen praise the Lord amen so you f you see here nobody's found worthy but then one of the elders says John don't weep yes for the lion of the tribe of Judah had prevailed am amen amen and he is worthy to take the book amen notice again prophecy before he does it you see all this time I'm prophesying to you about your original condition before you can probably even do it I'm telling you you're a God man telling you you're a God woman on the earth that's right I'm prophesying it before you so what did the Elder cry behold the L John said it obviously on the earth Behold the Lamb of God before he did it here now in heaven the Elder says the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed Amen to take the book amen before he does it that's then he comes forth and he does it amen so I'm I'm praying tonight that somebody will catch what I am saying amen I'm prophesying you ought to be conditioned and then I'm waiting for you to come and do it amen amen amen amen so now Jesus comes we know when John turns to L he doesn't see the lion that the Elder say he sees a lamb as it had been slain and then he takes the book from the one that's Seated on the throne amen and then you find there now going into Revelation chapter 6 he starts to break those seals he starts to expose the Satan the Satan schemes and he's right and we know he's broken they in symbol form nobody understood what the symbols were yes amen so he breaks it first in symbol form and then we find amen it unfolds all the way to Revelation chapter 8 where when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour you know uh there's some preachers who preach this and I just want to correct this you may hear even some popular preachers preaching this they say you see he broke the seven seal first because when he's breaking the first seal it doesn't say he broke read it there in your Bible you know what I'm talking about amen because I know some of you will never go home and read this revelation amen Revelation 6:1 what is this read here and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals so now they put Revelation to it they put their own Revelation to it you see they say see it doesn't say open the first seal it says open one of the seals so meaning he broke the seven seal right but then the argument Falls flat when you go to Revelation chapter 8 and there it says when he had opened the seven seal understand what I'm saying Revelation 61 says you open one of the seals right then you'll find Revelation 63 tells when he open the second seal then he goes third seal fourth seal fifth seal Sixth Seal then he comes to Revelation chapter8 and it says when he had opened the seven seal amen amen yes so 61 can't be the seven seal everybody understand am so when you hear somebody tell you that I'm showing you in the scripture that it's inaccurate amen hallelujah praise the Lord so yeah now the Lord Jesus Christ takes the book he reveals it in Revelation form in in symbol form and then now remember it's not different like the prophet would say I'm going to try and close now it's not like the prophet would say different people he says it's the same person changing form he says the book is not changing hands it's the person changing forms that's right amen hallelujah amen so he's changing form and we know now you got to tie in Daniel's Prophecy with this because he says in that day Michael shall deliver the names that are found in the book so who's Michael is an angel amen who's Michael Christ amen this is Prophet now yes amen you've been reading the message for all these years you know Michael is Christ yes amen hallelujah you know the Sevenfold amen Sevenfold Glory of his amen presence you know he reveals himself amen hallelujah you know about the seven spirits of God amen amen can you say Amen you know about all of these things so comes down now in Revelation 10 very important now Revelation 8 says when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven brother Bram says if you want to see the setting of Revelation 81 which is the seventh seal you'll find the setting found in Revelation 10 that's a quote the setting of it is found in Revelation 10 what do we find in Revelation 10 is that a mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with with a cloud amen amen am so can I say the mighty Angel is clothed with seven angels amen if we know what the cloud is come on now yes can I say that yes because the angel himself was his wig so we understand that so there's the mighty Angel come down clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun his feet tillers of fire very important now Yu's book and he had in his hand a little book open so the book is back on the earth amen yes amen I just showed you it was taken away Gone to Heaven Jesus Takes the book but now the book has come back to the Earth that's why we Rejoice amen the book titled deed to man in inheritance has come back to the Earth amen hallelujah now you can't live like they lived in the church ages oh thank you Lord the Holy Ghost is not outpouring himself in the manifestation of the gifts as in isza Street yes nether is moving through Sensations neither the Holy Ghost is not even moving right now amen hallelujah through just Angelic form but the Holy Ghost has now possessed a people amen the glory has come back to the Earth amen so what am I telling you the Cloud of Glory brought back man's inheritance to the Earth the mighty Angel has brought back your inheritance to the Earth so that you can be a son and daughter on the Earth again amen yes and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right hand right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices right and when the seven Thunders had out their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders ated and write them not now you know we even read the quote on Sunday that he'll reveal the Mysteries contained in the seals The Mystery of the seven Thunders and it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers amen so people have tried to hpe up these things and tried to create a Doctrine around it but it was really the revelation of the word of God revealing all the mysteries of God giving us a faith in this hour that was the Thunders to awaken us amen oh yes but they tried to make it a special Doctrine and preach it in an intellectual way that people couldn't even understand what they were saying yes amen praise the Lord but it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that will do what fulfill Malachi 4:5 and 6 amen turn our hearts back to the faith who brought this message Mighty Angel seven angels that's why we rejoicing at this time amen amen the book has been brought back to the Earth therefore you can't live a defeated life therefore now in this time in this season it's not like in the church ages it's not even the caliber of people that brother Bram was preaching to in his day come on now amen amen I just told you the Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 I'm talking about the Elijah Prophet was prophesying about a coming bride a coming people who will be a super race a super Church an invincible Army doesn't that sound like Elijah Pro John prophesying about Jesus you shall be a super raise a super Church even before there was a church he's prophesying these things about you come on you need to rise up to this you need to Rejoice around these trucks amen you need to excite yourself with these truths to say this is me thank you Lord amen amen but we can't get and we've seen this evident the truths can be taken away from us these truths can become you can Rejoice sometimes you rejoice around you for a while and then you get back weighed down by the cares of Life weigh down because you can't pay a bill weigh down because of sickness weigh down because and then you forget the promise of God we in the season of the rapture we in the season of the body change we're in the season now where Romans 8:23 is coming alive We Grown within ourselves grown within ourselves longing for what for inheritance full inheritance full Authority full sunship amen groaning within ourselves are you the Mark 11:23 man who can speak believe his own word don't doubt it yes and believe that which he has said has already come to pass am amen amen disciple start to tell people you're praying for listen I'm speaking words over you I don't want you to confess a negative thing again keep confessing that I am healed I am healed I am healed I am delivered I am set free I have a job I whatever you're praying I'm talking about the natural now start to believe for it start to speak it we find all of these testimonies about John Ryan the man that had amen jerking body amen the man that needed a new heart a new limb a new lung what they had to do he says don't care what the doctor says don't pay any attention to what the doctor say Amen pay attention to what the word of God says and don't let the word of God lie here in the pages of the book you become the manifested word as you speak the word you say Lord I believe your word [Music] amen sickness can't hold you down trials Can't Hold You Down circumstances Can't Hold You Down amen you're a powerful people amen you're an invincible Army you're a super Church yes you are called for more you are called for greater I'm not satisfied living a natural life I'm called for greater amen I'm called for more powerful I'm called for much more than this how many of you can identify with that I'm called for more how many if you don't feel at home in this world anymore how many if you feel your feel amen meant for Glory you are meant and designed for Glory of God in this hour I tell you it's another time and season when the angel came back with the open book it's another time and season for The Descendants on the earth for the people that's here to receive the word yes amen hallelujah Satan running around now trying to find the book he knows the book has returned to the Earth so what do you think he's going to try and to keep the revelation out of the people keep them recognizing amen not from recognizing that they possess the book making them doubt the prophet's message yes making them doubt the things about the cloud amen you talking about a cloud the cloud brought back the glory amen follow Revelation 10 the glory came back to the Earth yes yes amen that's right and go past 10:7 because we all saw the glory revealed in Luke 17:30 through Revelation 10:7 a son of man revealing the son of man the sign was undeniable he could speak and discern the hearts of the people yes with his back turned to them he could tell and discern them amen oh yes no sickness could stand before them amen he could speak to a storm and the storm would obey him he could speak to the Beast of the field and the Beast would obey him he could speak to Flying bees and the flying bees would obey him he could speak Amen to the fish of the sea and the fish of the sea came back to life amall Lord showing you man coming back into his Dominion Authority he's walking into virgin Timber there amen and the prophet says amen I'm laying there I'm looking at this deer and I look at my hands I see has turned young again God had to take him away because he would have been raptured otherwise hallelujah amen he would have had a hoch experience and you saw the Glimpse there when he's given the description he says I was there and I saw I turned young again and I looked before me and there stood my wife and she was young come on now amen he was living so connected so close to this amen that he started to change Dimensions so God had to take him off the scene because it was not yet time and season for Enoch for him to have an Enoch experience oh yes what was it showing God had fully adopted this son and what was he doing waving him before the people hey bride of Christ amen that's why you looked at this Prophet for so many years and you said what manner of man is this amen hallelujah people amen start to look to this man but I tell you amen the attention was not for you to look to this man alone amen as much as God used his body gloriously amen the attention was you can come to this image if you follow the walk in the same way if you follow the same Footprints the same message that he brought you can come into this image because I'm waving the shei before you to show that many more Sons shall come to life oh yes give God praise amen glory glory glory praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen amen hallelujah so the glory that's what 963 is about 28th February they deny it because Satan is trying to deny that the glory has come back to man now remember it can be there in Prophecy for many years but the people need to awaken to it yes and God is awakening us to it oh yes God is awakening us to it now Satan is coming you're going berserk the book is back on the earth I must get to the book but John ate the
