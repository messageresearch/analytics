amen and I believe you all blessed with the word of God amen hallelujah amen I was out there at IL Tabernacle and it was a privilege to be a part of the celebration of Pastor Dan n amen having turned 80 years old you know the Lord had changed the years of man on the Earth and man was never meant to die but after the fall in Noah's time he said man's days will be 120 years amen but then sin that still kept in and then he reduced the number of years for man and then you find in the Psalms it's telling you that it's appointed to every man three score and 10 and he says if by virtue of Grace then 80 years amen so the brother has seen 0 years some people live a bit longer but a man he's been faithful in the gospel faithful Steward of the Lord amen he's been a faithful servant of God so continue to pray for Pastor Dan we're not sure amen how much longer the Lord will allow him to be here but we need to give honor where honor is due amen amen hallelujah and we rather give them a rose while they alive yes amen amen now think about it this way God called him to be one of the first men to be in an area where there was no mess's church and to do something and believe something that's rejected of men they're calling you a cult they calling all kinds of things so you must really hear from [Music] God Amen to be able to go out yes Amen to stand in the midst of criticism yes Amen to stand as one of the Pioneers there's nobody else no other churches around so you must have heard from God Amen he went out with the 10 meetings and he went out amen evangelizing amen and the Lord has been gracious to him I believe amen you know the prophet says that he was taken up into this place and he was shown a time of rewards hallelujah amen I believe our brother has a great reward in store brother Bram says one Soul attached to your name it'll be wrapped around your name for eternity and he says one soul is worth 10,000 worlds amen so we should do what we can to witness for the Lord amen praise the Lord so I was really happy to be there a part of the celebration and share the word of the Lord uh if you don't know amen Pastor Dan actually dedicated me as a baby amen so for me it was a special privilege to be able to go there and honor the man of God for his 80th birthday amen so he's been a pastor to pastors Hallelujah he's been a faithful servant of God and we pray the Lord will continue to bless him amen so let's turn to our Bibles praise the Lord amen let's turn to Ephesians chapter 1 I want to say this to you this evening grace be to you amen and peace amen from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ amen according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now that's God's expectation of us amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen you may be seated praise the Lord amen so people in this life they live their lives wondering what their purpose is what am I really called for and nobody really can find the answer to it except we find it in the word of God when men probe they probe and they look at maybe Evolution and they probe at how they were formed on the earth and they science wants them to believe or the world system want them to believe that they are random act there was no thought put into it they just evolved out of nothing amen that's what they indoctrinating the people with so they feel they are worth nothing therefore they gone through something now where they're going through a gender crisis they don't even know their identity amen whether they're a man or a woman they can't Define what a woman is they can't Define what a man is amen that has reached a level of insanity amen but what a comfort we have to know that we can go to the word of God and not only tell you your Origins but also tell you what he predestinated you to become amen amen hallelujah yes to go to the word of God and show you not only your Earthly journey in life but show you your pre-existence your Earthly journey and your future home amen only the word of God can provide these answers amen so we stand here today amen as we approaching the Zero Hour very important time for us now we are approaching the Zero Hour amen that's right and the countdown has brought us to this place yes amen amen the cown has brought us to this place the countdown started in the Days of Elijah yes in the days of the seventh angel amen but the down has brought us to this Zero Hour Amen in brother bram's day we talk about 3 Minutes to Midnight I tell you the clock has moved much further we have approaching the Zero Hour you know the prophet Will Tell Us in the message countdown God doesn't count the way man counts they count 10 9 8 7 6

over the place Focus amen take a scripture and keep repeating it amen so look at a scripture meditate on that scripture until all the thought thoughts of the day have gone by all the other thoughts have gone out now you can focus on the scripture you know the prophet says an amazing thing giving us a secret to something statue of for perfect man he said I'll go into the wordss and I'll meditate on the Lord and I'll just think on a number and it says I'll keep thinking on it like 1 * 1 is 1 * 1 is 1 1 * 1 is 1 1 * 1 or 2 * 2 and 2 * 2 how many of you ready the most connected man in the Age is telling us something there he says this thing will just keep coming and he'll just keep meditating on it and then all of a sudden something will break he L break into a vision and he'll see something and the spirit of God will tell him go here here here here here some of you are looking at me like you never heard these things and the prophet will never say something like this amen I me if you know the prophet explained the gift too much yes the angel told him that you've explained the gift too much that's why they arose kindal impersonations now I ask you if the caral impersonators can study this life in Ministry and when he gave away too much how about us students of his message amen if he gave away too much it's in there amen amen so he says if it doesn't break into a vision it'll break into the world and then he'll take his pen and start writing scripture upon scripture and he'll tie this with that and he said he's got an Abit of doing drawings amen you'll see he's got an Abit of doing drawings to to bring it out amen praise the Lord amen but he's taking away your lock of hair he's taking away he's come now and you're thinking the pope can't deceive me Antichrist can't deceive

spirituality is gone but these men in the midst of the open hounds amen they say Amen so that I know it's not true that I'm talking about come on now in the midst of their trial in the midst of the

cries and he must come down yes we stand here today and say even so Lord Jesus come amen now you and I stand like we read there in Ephesians you going to read that anybody ask you what's your purpose in life show them Ephesians 1:3 from 3 that's my purpose God wrote that about me the position I'll come to what he call me holy unblamable predestinated to be Sons children of God yes that's God wrote that about me yes amen but we stand in this privileged position how many of you feel it's a privileged position ought to be called from millions of people yesen what a privilege has been given to us what an honor has been given to us amen we stand in this heavenly position to be able to stand here and see things clearly the the way we do yes amen without doubt without reservation amen we are using the looking glass of God's word amen amen and to see the whole book open before our very eyes to see the entire book open before our eyes what a privileged position we are in church amen what a privileged position to be able to see the mysteries of God because to you it has been given to know and understand the mysteries of God the mysteries of the kingdom yes Amen to see and understand the

position I'm saying it so many times we are in a privileged position amen hallelujah we are called to Heavenly places we are called didn't we read in John in Revelation 4 we are called to come up higher amen while the latest see mess was going on there's a knock on the door Jesus is put outside the church he tells them if you overcome if you open the door to me you can come sit on my Throne hello and how you what do you know next chapter somebody overcame somebody was elevated to a position to see things yes yes amen somebody said was called to come up higher amen come up higher now I want you to know the sequence of events in that book is literally how we were latestly I kicked him out we opened the door we were drawn into this elevated position and we were taken into the throne room because the mystery of God must be revealed amen under the seventh Angel's message according to Revelation 10:7 yes and we are shown the throne room and shown the one God Amen one sitting on the throne amen amen praise the Lord am amen so we are called to come up higher now who was called to come up higher his name was John John is a type of the Bride amen amen John is a type of the Bride amen the bride was called up higher what a privileged position has been given to the bride amen what a position what a privileged call we have heard even our ears were anointed to hear this amen yes amen yes amen hallelujah a special class of people is what the prophet of the age called you yes give the Lord a good and clamp of praise for being a special class of people amen special class of people who can handle the Revelation amen not get confused amen I want you to know there is no Babylon in the message of the hour How can there be confusion in the message of the hour there is no confusion amen praise the Lord so we are called to come up higher when we read the news now we see how things are being strategically placed positioned and aligned to fulfill the end time prophecies hallelujah amen maybe maybe a few months ago amen before October the 7th you don't think much about Israel being in wars and caught up in Wars amen but God was showing you showing you what's happening to spiritual Israel that's right because spiritual Israel connected with the angel of God in 2023 ah amen that takes Faith to believe amen because it's God in Simplicity hallelujah amen around the world people didn't know but they were connecting Exodus [Music] 23:23 I sent my angel before thee and the angel of God was connecting with the bride worldwide and started to change their Ministries without them even knowing amen that they all start to say the same thing amen they all start to reposition the bride they all start to reestablish amen amen yes the Believers and they all start to talk about the Holy Ghost and how to receive the Holy Ghost and how to come back into your land yes but that was spiritual Israel taking up the fight connecting with the angel of God amen amen but then watch the attack come upon natural Israel 10th month seven day spiritual attack on natural Israel why 200 million demons now I ask you to identify the attack on spiritual Israel identify the attack on your life see how he's taken away see how maybe he's made you compromise see how he's been attacking that's just what you're seeing happen in the news to Natural Israel is only a sign for you to wake up yes amen and take be aware because they were taken unawares amen right amen hallelujah but you have Watchmen on the tower that this bride will not be taken unawares to keep you in remembrance of the prophet's message amen hallelujah to keep you amen fed in the time of famine to keep spiritual food being poured out to the people amen so when we read the news we can see everything real aligning shifting shaping amen politics amen America telling Israel please don't attack Iran don't retaliate hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen this I'm saying it again this is a privileged position to be able to see these things this is the Bright's privileges amen this privilege is given to Sons born Sons trained Sons amen sons who have gone through an experience amen all

adopted Hallelujah let me tell you something he's come to empower you this time yes and in this season yes where you'll obtain everything except the new body but you'll be in position of authority and Power the only thing you'll be lacking in this time of season is the new body but in position and in Authority you stand here knowing you're a son of a king thank you Lord thank you Lord amen praise the Lord thank you Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah born Sons strange Sons amen Holy Ghost filled Sons and Daughters of God we see these things going on with eagle eyes and we understand the times and the seasons amen this is not given to somebody else this privileged position is not given to all the denominational preachers I could name them right now but I don't want to waste my time amen this ought to be treasured amen this ought to be valued it ought to be appreciated amen we ought to have a heart of gratitude come before the Lord every morning come before the Lord every evening thank you Jesus thank you Lord that you have called me to this position oh god father this is a sacred trust that's been given to me and I value this position you have given to me oh God help me Lord not to squander my inheritance yes amen this is not the time and the season to be a prodigal son amen this is the time you are to be returning back to Father's House amen and if you have been a pro prodigal son maybe you've squandered all of Father's inheritance amen father's inheritance is gifted you but you squandered the gifts amen he's placed you for a specific anointing but you squandered the anointing when you come back to Father's house he's going to reano you he's going to regift you amen if you come back to Father's House don't come with a mentality of servant here in father's house he's going to put you back in your position that's what the ministry of Malachi 45 comes to do to turn your heart and put you back in your position somebody give God [Applause] [Music] praise amen we got to realize what our father is amen we talk about that slave amen who stood upright in the midst of slavery in the midst of terrible conditions around him he stood as a son of a king I'm asking you

quite sad talking to Buzzard amen it's quite sad talking to chickens amen because you cannot relate anymore yes when you talk to chickens and Buzzard they are talking chicken language foul language amen and sometimes you got to come down to their level because they associate with you in form of friends and families and now you come there and you hearing them but you just come from Heavenly places and this language is stor to you amen hallelujah amen you can't St up that and you want to fly back up praise the Lord amen amen this is not the time amen for a season of debates and the season of fasting and the season of fighting the time has come to position ourselves in our ought to be conditioned why you think the Bible says let him that's filthy be filthy and let him that's Unholy be Unholy let him that's holy be holy amen amen oh praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen that's why the apostle Paul he reached such a level he said let us put away those childish things like fasting on doctrines of this and that and this and that baptisms and godheads and all of these things but he says let us move onto Perfection I would have loved to have this conversation with you maybe 5 years ago or 10 years ago but right now my focus is changed right now my diet has changed right now my sight is fixed Heavenly amen amen amen so we want to thank the Lord that he's been rich in Mercy like the Bible says in Ephesians he's been the god of Grace he's been the god of Mercy many times Satan could have ended our Lives Many Times Satan come upon us we could have been despondent

he's poured his grace upon me called us to this elevated position so that we can see a far off we don't have to be Earthbound and trapped by latan spirits in the chicken yard but I can SW like a flying eagle because I've been equipped with the spirit of a flying Eagle amen the bride under a messenger amen becomes the final voice to the final age some people call their own Prophet a liar some people call their own Prophet a liar and how of you know sometimes they don't physically say it with words but there's a saying that actions speak louder than words so they call their own Prophet a liar in fact they call call their own father a liar because their father said the bride under her messenger becomes the final voice to the final age your father said it now you want to make your father a liar by denying it by silencing the final voice amen but when we are flying now soaring amen we are not bumping into any other birds yeah we only should be bumping into Eagles amen we should

little higher you know the prophet of the age was caught up in a constellation of angels his position was elevated position was elevated I was hearing a brother say this and it really got me to think maybe we didn't understand those things too well maybe we don't understand it to its full effect what happened he's caught up in the constellation of angels and he's trying to describe it hello you believe the prophet was caught up yes amen amen you can read in the Book of Matthew Mark Luke and John when they are telling you the account of when Jesus is lifted up into a cloud on Mount Transfiguration and now they entered into the cloud yes amen so ask you yourself this when science took the picture they measured it at being 26 mil high and 30 Mi wide but the Striking thing is cuz you think the prophet maybe was caught up here there there is no oxygen at 26 mil High yeah hello so how can you breathe there they say that altitude you can't breathe you'll die so what happened to you hello why you looking away I'm asking you to face up to the question amen come I go put you 26 miles high and see he says in a moment in the twinkling of an eye faster than you can blink your eyes he's trying to tell you something there quicker than you can blink your eyes he was caught up into the constellation of angels amen praise the Lord food for thought right you can think about it I never tell you anything anything I just asked you something and I told you can you breathe there that's all I asked you amen C up in this constellation caught up now you know when we're in an
