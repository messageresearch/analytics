========================================

[Music] and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit they often did eat and gave unto her husband with her and he did eat three seven and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons so eating on this fruit made them recognize that they were naked it made them recognize their moral condition or should i say their immoral condition amen then we drop down to verse 12 brother caleb and he says and the man said the woman whom that gave us to be with me she gave me off the tree and i did eat so we're seeing a whole lot of eating and the lord said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat so what is this heating about it's symbology let's go to proverbs 30 and 20 and see what the teaching is about it's not eating off an apple a pear apricot the church world is deceived that's another creed and dogma that was brought in you see a serpent wrapped around the tree with an apple in his mouth first place nobody would go near a serpent with an apple in its mouth proverbs 30 and 20 look at what eating represents such is the way of an adult who's woman she eaten why put her mouth and said i've done no wickedness and i have done no wickedness revelation 10 8 after the prophetic anointing has come upon the earth after revelation 10 7 when that voice begins to sound and the mystery of god is revealed then comes revelation 10 8 and a voice which i heard from heaven speak unto me again go take the little book which is open in the end of the angel which stand it upon the sea and upon the earth watch all this angel is positionally placed that's revelation 13 a beast rising up out of the sea a piece rising out of the earth so the angel is positionally placed suppressing these two powers amen i went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book watch one with authority one with boldness amen give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up amen yes and he shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey you remember wednesday's message we broke all of this down amen hallelujah it shall be in thy belly butter but in that mouth sweet as honey amen let's go to the next verse and i took the little book out of the angel damn and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me that must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings [Music] we broke the down in the last message showing you how it was a fresh anointing the complete plan of revelation was now revealed to a bride the hidden mystery that was in the best part of god's mind had never hit the world before but now through the descending of the mighty angel the covenant angel when he descends with the book redemption's plan is revealed to an end-time people and even though jesus prophesied in amen in the book of matthew 28 i told them go into all the world preach the gospel yeah they were preaching a partial gospel that's right because the lamb had not yet taken the book in revelation 5. amen but after this lamb ascends to heaven and he begins to take the book and open the seals down comes this messenger the angel of the covenant with an open book back to the earth and his fresh word of prophecy must be prophesied to the people complete plan must be revealed to a people that's why the world is prophesy again amen implying the prophecy has gone forth but you need to do it again amen but watch where the prophecy is going now it's going to many people nations towns and kings means it's a job for you and i to find these people yes sir amen let's find them this morning amen amen let's go to revelation 13 verse 7. let's see where the people of nation tanks and kings are so we know where the prophecy needs to go because remember part of the third paul is preaching to them lost yes and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and overcome them and power was given to him over all kindred towns and nations who is this we're talking about the beast all right power is given unto him over kindreds towns and nations let's follow these people revelation 17 1 and they came one of the seven angels without the seven vials and talked to me saying unto me come up either and i will show thee the judgment of the great orb would sitteth upon many watches who's the great all mystery babylon mama is sitting on people mama is oppressing people mama is a gold digger digging out the money from the people a man the richest mama you know and she's sitting on many waters let's go to verse 15 with the caleb to get a definition of what these waters were and he said unto me the watchers which they saw where the horse sitted are multitudes and nations and towns now you know why your prophecy is to preach to the laws they are oppressed people would rather settle for a creed than a dogma than the pure unadulterated word of god true and let me tell you our daughters are no better man daughter lent prosperity gospel from mama that's right so seed sow a seed of a thousand dollars says benny him be connected to the anointing why would you want to be connected to a demonic anointing when the bible says come by of me [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen now we find that this beast that we are talking about this beast that was wounded to death this roman system legs of iron ran all the way into the toes but mixed with clay clay typing of people but the spirit runs through the people now we are talking about the final prophecy in the age of the ten toes we find that it was wounded unto death but imperial pagan rome that fell amen became people wrong the strongest empire the roman empire which god had used at that time to bring a persecution on the people that had rejected christ had now been conquered but under constantine it came back to life when he saw his kingdom was being overtaken what did he do he put a cross on his shield church and state he put a cross on his shield and he went into battle he brought the christian faith into pagan rome they used to worship the sun god now they said we worship the son of god people roam and infiltrate to the whole world a power is absolute amen the prophet says she uses kings and merchants in a deadly religious and final financial strength she is governing as goddess of this present age she is also the dragon that stood waiting to devour the man-child we know that error tried to kill the lord jesus and failed later jesus was crucified by roman soldiers but he is now caught up to the throne that's revelation chapter 12 now along with what we said and if we recall the vision of daniel which you just went through the last part of the image the last world power was in the feet that was iron and clay the iron is the roman empire but now it is no longer solid iron clay is mixed in yes it is there and running world affairs in both the democratic nations and the more despotic ones the lonely shirt is in every nation it is mixed up in it all yes i want to tell you that the roman church is in every denominational church this morning because they have come an economical move amen they have come under that one world religion so that worship this morning that image unto the beast has already been erected and this morning millions and millions are worshiping the image of the beast amen what did jesus say the father is seeking those that will worship in spirit and in truth there is no truth out there there is no spirit out there they've rejected the leadership of the holy spirit but you're in the message of the hour we rely upon the leading of the holy spirit amen amen you are in the message of the hour that is present-day truth amen walk in the light hallelujah he is the light amen amen oh hallelujah running world affairs running democratic nations the more despotic ones the prophet says look at the end of gold babylon amen look at how it amen was defeated look at all the needs and persians the greek empire the roman empire was defeated but look who's been ruling now for over 2 000 years amen amen that's right amen but thank god the prophecy amen if we are saying there's a prophecy in the last days in the days of the ten toes there is prophesied to come a song a stone that's rolling in babylon amen a strong prophesy that was cut out without him saying man our lord jesus christ is coming back to wash your feet amen how is he doing it through revelation upon this rock peter i will build my church the gates of hell shall not prevail against revelation revelation that is given to a people on the earth titled deep being given back to our people amen amen the god of heaven cut his stone out of the mountain without hands and smoke the image in its feet and broke all the gentile kingdoms down and the kingdom of christ will rule and reign amen this is what the prophet identified falling the two big toes in the ten toes eisenhower and khrushchev eisenhower was the us president crusher was the right soviet union leader the next picture all right so here he is and this is what the prophet picks up in 1960 12th of october crochet pounds his shoes now there were five eastern nations and there were five western nations and the prophetic eye of this eagle prophet looking through scripture picks it up and ties it with daniel's vision and said we are living in the age of the ten toes he said look at those two big toes this is here now at the un general assembly and iron and clay does not mix eisenhower was representing the western nations khrushchev was representing the eastern nations they became into a disagreement so much so he could not handle it and to express his outrage that this is not normal behavior for somebody to take off their shoe and start beating the guests does he look like a madman banging his shoe shoe banging at the ul throwing a tantrum telling you there will not be a mixing of these powers remember there are 10 kings prophesied 10 awns 10 crowns right the prophet says they are raised up for a specific purpose they're not mixing together iron and putin was put in you know putin means put in break the word up put an in he was put in biden sleepy joe if you don't know who's running things behind the scenes obama this was obama's deputy and they never got to fulfill all of their plans major thing happened recently because we're living in the days of sodom and gomorrah you remember obama made it legal for gay rights first time now last weekend this national thing in the u.s a man who identifies as a woman competed against women in a swimming race and he won the race he called himself transgender you know what they say they identify as a woman now you can in this day and age they tell you that your mother and father cannot tell you what gender you are when you come of age you can decide what gender you are they call it gender neutral now this is not small things because as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be now what is it done for women's rights poor women have been fighting for so long equal rights equal rights equal rights now all the rights were taken away because they fought for rights in our age of people's rights they fought for their rights so much that now men have the right to become a woman and compete in their own race and beat them now where they've been complaining that we were unfairly treated that men have been putting us down we want equal rights they've given too much rights that now men are competing with women you'll find it happening more and more you won the swimming race now there's a big outcry against that they should put tougher restrictions they shouldn't allow these men to take part with women all you got to do is tell them you identify as a woman and you can compete with a woman so we live in an age of people's rights now we showed you the picture the two big toes biting and putin it's come down but watch in the age of the two big toes let's continue reading what the prophet said here just to give you context it says let me give you something on the iron in clay remember when crusher beat yeshua on the desk at the u.n well there were five eastern nations and there were five western khrushchev spoke for the east and president eisenhower for the west in russian khashoggi's clay and eisenhower means iron the two main leaders of the world the two big toes of the feet of iron and clay were side by side he says we are in the end of it all then he says who is able to make war with the beasts now they are in some present times some great names in the world there's mighty nations but right now rome is calling the tune the pope is in the driver's seat and his power is going to increase no one can war against him all shall worship the beast except whose names are written in the lamb's book of life thank god for the sheep will not worship him everyone but the very elect will be deceived but they will not be deceived for they heard the shepherd's voice and they follow him amen amen now why i was tying that up hollywood puts it in there movies the politicians are now you can see they're putting it outside the u.n what they're doing then you remember the last time we showed you about the seagull and the crow outside the vatican we showed you one was a bird of the sea one was a bird of the land all typing revelation 13. then i found this cartoon because cartoonists can also put it out there we spoke about the true banging thing look at how this artist did it why is he typing putin to khrushchev he says back to the good old days why did the prophet identify this event as the ten toes watch this artist putin's got a shoe in his hand and he is saying it's the exact same thing as what khrushchev did church this is now how many years later 62 years later 62 years later how much more has that kingdom weaken now in the days of the prophet you know what he said he said look our poke now he's trying to bring about this one world religion we showed you in the last message how he's already signed it up 62 years later what was prophesied he's already come to pass 62 years later there's a people on the earth who are not deceived a stone coming forth to crush the ten toes amen watch now this is not an ordinary picture he is telling you look at the present time back to the good old days let me break it down to you spirits do not die don't look at the man amen same spirit that anointed crusher same spirit announcing future [Music] oh two hundred million demons let loose at the river euphrates said islam mussolini silent anointed these men to drive the jews back to their homeland and he says they've been coming now this is in the messy seventieth week of daniel he says they've been coming for the last 40 years 70th week of daniel was preaching 60s they've been coming for the last 70 years back to the homeland and we preached the messenger last time showing you the reason for the russian invasion it's because they have the highest population of jews staying in ukraine and god is and you remember we showed you the picture and the article where they bombed their isolated jewish town it's time to drive the jews back to the homeland amen you say don't they have enough jews in the homeland no they all need to come under the ministry of moses and elijah they all must be given a fair chance we preached you they must recognize the day and their message so god is driving raising up putin as a tool like the pharaoh to drive the ukrainian jews back to their homeland but he's also giving the world us time we touched on the support earlier when there is pressure when these are at war there is scarcity of oil bringing into light matthew 25. where there is a shortage of oil what is oil signifying the holy ghost what does the holy ghost bring revelation it's time for a simulation of revelation it's time not to go you want to go back to those good old days i say it's time for the bride to go back to an acts 2 38 revival amen another moving of the spirit amen another sweeping time amen where those men were not afraid amen these men are not drunk as you suppose seeing that it is the third hour of the day but this is that what's the prophet william branham have prophesied that in the last days there will come another prophetic class of people in the land again who under their messenger will become the final voice to the final age in the age of the 10 goals amen amen amen hallelujah now watch when the nations are so weakened when it's iron which is a much weaker metal running through clay and he says they can't mix the prophet says what they were trying to do they married their catholic daughters to the protestant boys and you know they're they're very strict about how the child must be raised and he says they made it law that the children must be raised catholic so breaking that hold he says they can't mix now we want to end quickly with this to show that in the midst of iron and clay we're talking about that image now remember the image was a gentile kingdom head of gold right coming down to the toes iron and clay talking about a political system that will rule the earth in the midst of this god is raising up a people but they are not made of clay they are not made of iron he calls them pure gold amen taking us back to another head seven golden candlesticks he says and thou shalt be made a candle stick of pure gold be beaten work of the candle be made he shaft his branches his bowels cuffs his flowers shall be made the same the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold now watch when i'm reading this i'm talking about you her righteousness is his righteousness unfiltering and failing it's not your works lest any man should boast her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him amen what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest amen there is no fault in her amen she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her lord and all his words are perfect in fact in her he summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for god had spoken it now he says the candlestick of gold is beaten gold handcrafted and beaten gold according to a blueprint which was spirit given outside of our lord and master jesus christ was ever people so beaten and purged as the bride of jesus christ surely she is filling up the suffering that christ has left behind her goods that are spoiled her life is in jeopardy she has accounted a sheep for the slaughter she is killed all the day long she suffers much and in it all she retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of christ and as gold is malleable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of god will bear a suffering for the lord not bowed not broken not destroyed performed as a thing of beauty and a joy forever by the trials and testings of this life amen amen he is bringing you forth this gold side in fire but remember the point of this message is in the midst of these ten toes when we see it coming to an end now the prophecy must go forth because you see where the peoples of the nations are you see the [ __ ] sitting on earth when you're sitting it's controlling her they are trapped in that denominational system they are trapped in that hindu system trapped in all religion but the prophecy must go forth because the last part of their third pull was to preach to the lost now i just showed you how the you are being tried you are being beaten you are being brought forth as gold amen you're born in fact you've been designed for this hour you don't see things the way the world see things people see things and they can't understand russia ukraine war you understand it because the prophet says you're from another world the spirit comes from above where holiness and righteousness dwell right we know the spirit comes from that seventh dimension he says born again christians is an odd ball to the world because you've been changed you're from another world your spirit is from across the chasm if you're not different there's something wrong you're still earthbound you ought to be heavenly minded and heaven lives by the word all our lives are to be so submitted where the holy spirit will live through us speak to us let's not forget the final prophecy in the age of the ten toes don't be slack concerning the things of god if god has called you to preach and preach if god has called you to witness and witness if god has called you to testify testify amen any day now my lord is coming he'll be returning for you [Music] sing it again for you and me oh i've been watching and i've been waiting just any day now [Music] one [Music] for you and me [Music] i'll see [Music]
