inheritance amen for our safety yes Hallelujah but the devil don't want that yes so he he's doing everything he can and today the word is just going after that because even our jobs people put so much

the Lord Brethren let the presence of Jesus Christ the word of God have preeminence in our life amen and it is every aspect of your life amen AB amen praise the Lord all parts amen hallelujah God want

on the message and say oh it is son uh Prophet message this message is not a Prophet message amen it is from the Throne of God God used the prophet to bring his word praise the Lord amen thank you Lord some say he made a mistake but I tell you Brethren that every mistake of a prophet is a message Moses made a mistake but that was a message to you and I to learn from yes Isaiah made a mistake yes yes he was just looking at the king the king had prospered and asai was just behind the king until the king one day went to the temple try to offer sacrifice he told him King oh that this is not your place he said believe me I am the king I can do anything and God Str him with Leprosy when that happened Isaiah came to himself when he want to pray and then God revealed to him Hallelujah so every prophet Hallelujah they might make mistake but it is for you and I to learn amen when Moses struck the Rock God said to him you have not stif faring before the people it was a lesson for you and I to learn from yes no matter how how great God uses you Hallelujah he want you to stay humble amen yes Lord never think one day oh I'm so great yes I'm so big I can do anything I want no don't get familiar with God Amen always stay humble let him have the preeminence Hallelujah yes praise the Lord that is the problem with the world today even some some people who come in the circle of Christian

for our good yes amen not for him plus me minus me God is still God yes so if I come to the place and say oh I'm so big I'm I'm now this I'm that God can pack me out of the way yes and God is still God yes Jesus said to the children uh of Israel if you tell the children to shut their mouth God have power to raise us Stones amen so we need to stay humble amen so that God can work on us amen amen he said that's right I don't care is throne Dominion whatever it is Heavenly Thrones kingdoms whatever it might be in the great Supernatural realm Beyond in the eternities where it was whatever it was angels Gods whatever it was he is before all things amen amen praise the Lord and today some of us don't want for him to be before us God is a leader and if he's in your life he will lead you amen you don't lead yourself that is why Paul could say I'm a prisoner of Christ amen he leads us we are sheep sheep without Shepherd they are vulnerable yes amen they will go astray yes and that is why the word is going astray today they are doing their own things and the word will go that way into destruction yes because without God you can do nothing amen praise the Lord absolutely can't you see him

and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself amen by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven there is that great being we are talking about the beginning of the creation of God now his his very whole purpose was the C CR mean the church amen all that God was thinking of all that he was doing he was thinking of the Bride amen praise the Lord when he made the Earth he was thinking of his bride when he made everything he was thinking of his bride it was in him that he will have a bride without spot or wrinkle amen so because of that even Christ died before the foundation of the word amen he had you in his mind amen praise the Lord he knew you would you believe the message of the hour yesen we talk of Jesus birth being so uh wonderful it's a miracle but you know about you amen yourself yes for you to be here today it took God so many amen some of our fathers went through War yes some through pestilence some true

Spirit we are all baptized in one body the church the body of Christ Hallelujah yes the body of Christ this mystical Body of Christ sons of God from all over the I mean the word amen from every corner

praise the Lord and Paul said this bride will be without spot or wrinkle amen she can't help but being what God say she will be yes amen because we come from God and we are going back to God yes yes amen praise the Lord amen yes we come from God and that is why we hear from God yes amen like the little iglet yeah amen the story was told the Hunter went in the bush and took the eagle egg and brought it and put it under the hand and it was there the egg has along with the chicken eggs and they all there maybe they hand do and then the E will watch and say what what are they doing the the

in government you are you are deceiving yourself amen if you put your hope in the the the United Nation you are deceiving yourself amen praise the Lord let God have preeminence in your life yes Lord one thing he never he never he never he he he he never lose the battle praise the Lord amen so he had you in his mind yes yes and like Paul said we should love as Christ love the church amen yes Lord praise the Lord amen and he gave himself for it amen can you imagine that this great God coming down made his lower than Angels just for you yes he took all the pain yes all the shame yes that you and I supposed to go through yes that's right just so that you can have salvation thank you Jesus amen amen thank you Lord he said now inside that is Spirit which you become when you are born in the earth and the Breath of Life is breathed into you I mean into him that spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God but it was permitted by God yes when you come into this word the spirit that you have it is not given from God that is why he said you must be born again praise the Lord amen like I was saying to the church the other day he has to give you his spirit so that he have to give you a new spirit so that you can get along with his spirit amen amen he said for every child that is born in the word is born in sin shap in iniquity come come to the world speaking lies that's right so that person inside there is a sinner to begin with amen now is got five inlets first I know is Imagination conscience memory reasons affections love there are five inlets to the spirit you can think with your body you have to think with your spirit amen he said you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit amen you can't have you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculties at all your body your your body doesn't your body doesn't amen so you have to think with your spirit you have no reason I mean you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being because reason doesn't see taste feel smell or hear reason is what you can make in your mind if you are asleep or you are out your body is laying there dead but your spirit can still reason yes there are five senses that control that Inside Man yes amen now to the last man which is the the soul there is only one sense that controls that yes and that is moral agency free will to choose or to reject amen hallelujah so you either choose to receive or to reject you can either have faith or you can doubt yes amen that is the soul so it is only one and like um the prophet said it's like television there's no station in the television but this the television has uh the mechanism that get the station so when you turn the channels yes whatsoever Channel you turn it to it catches it yes amen so for us if you if you doubt you are opening your channel to the devil yes and if you have faith then you open your channel to God amen amen yes and when you open your channel to God then God enters in and he have the preeminence in your life amen hallelujah yes say I watched one time at the seashore where a wind was glowing and it was just shaking it was up at Lake migan I was standing out there washing the waves as they would come in and the water the waters is jumping and the boat acking and I thought what is that going on I thought why the lake is having a r survival yes amen is it I mean that's it it's jumping and shaking why there is a rushing Mighty Wind coming down out on it yes I thought well you know what there isn't one more drop of water in it right now then what it was when it was perfectly still no more water in it is just all stir up well now what it stir up about you know what is stirring up of the water does washes all the trash out of amen hallelujah up on the banks Hallelujah when there's a Revival yes it washes all the trash out amen we need a Revival to wash all the trash out Hallelujah yes that is what Revival does he said that's what we need a washing of unbelief out on the bench let the word of God have preeminence that's what we need a Revival and wash all the unbelief out and all the box and superstitions and things come out and see that God is still God hallelujah this is not something that we we just want to be church goers yes this is not something to say oh I just believe the message this is something that we should we should possess the life because if there's any one to represent God it is the church yes the Bible say all that was in God yes was put in Christ and all that was in Christ was put in his church it is about time yes that God should have preeminence in his church amen we want to see godj amen amen When Faith takes the preeminence there is no more room for fear amen It cast it away amen and may all of our deps be driven from us now yes that the holy spirit will have preeminence in every heart amen and every mind amen Soul yes Lord amen amen look on my Transfiguration when the testimony of God himself this is my beloved Son hear ye him the fullness of godhead is made known The Secret of mystery is now revealed that God is Man God and man become one the anointed man Christ what does Christ mean the anointed one yes the anointed one that was anointed with the fullness of the god head bodily oh my how can people doubt it yes amen people are still doubting it today yes and if you doubt it yesterday you will doubt it today if you doubt that Christ was the manifestation of [Music] God the invisible God became visible amen he became the embodyment of God God was in Christ reconciling the word unto himself he said unto himself so the body was born and that is a mystery Hallelujah today people say how how can it be this great go was born in a manger yes but God is revealed in Simplicity amen am when you are looking for God in high places you miss God yes because he go to the lowly yes when he even came they said he was he was uh friends of sinners at one point the Bible say he had need to pass the way of Samar a woman with ill thing she's no good she don't go when virgins go to fresh water she go in the quietness of time no one around her because of Shame yes Amen in that shame was a seed of God hallelujah and God had to pass that amen amen no matter your condition if you are a child of God God still love you God care for you God want to serve you amen and he want to have preeminence in your life you know when God comes oh so many things happen yes your life change because the Bible say If any man be Christ is's a new creature yes amen the old things are passed away and All Things become new amen hallelujah amen yeah that new thing is not this body yeah yes because this body will get old yes and wrinkle but that new thing is the renewing of your mind amen that God should have the preeminence in you yes amen that when God tells you something you hear in and you do them amen this message is not for profession it is possession possession you possess the life because Jesus said the word that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen people say oh I'm in the message but I asked the question is the message in you amen praise the Lord because God is coming for a bride that is like him amen hallelujah hallelujah he says when he created the first man the Bible say he created The Man In His Image and likeness so God could see Adam and see himself in Adam amen and God is coming for a bride that you will see himself in thatl amen amen this last day bride must be like Christ amen and that is why the fullness of the word is being revealed yes absolutely the word was revealed for the BL to know herself Lord hallelujah the the sea was not open for no one else but for the BR to know herself for her to know her inheritance for her to know where she's going and know who God have made amen amen because when you don't know who you are you can never perform what you were call amen yes many people today are living underprivileged life they don't know themselves yes and if you don't know yourself you can do anything yes amen but we need to come to ourselves absolutely like the protal son he took his possession and went far off country like some of us today we leave God and go into things yes and we think we are living lives but then when we come to ourselves like him said see me here I shouldn't be here my father has everything even my my father's Serv they eat and they waste food why should I be here yes yes amen our father has everything amen the world has nothing yes everything that you

must be born again amen hallelujah so that even when we die we will still live am live thank you Lord hallelujah and through that purpose that he achieved a church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in the last day amen hallelujah when he gets the preeminence in the church the position his place in the church Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also even more than this yes shall he do hallelujah thank you Lord that is where the church should come to amen God should have the preeminence yes and let me tell you church God

you said perform what you said amen do it amen to modernization have made us to believe in ourselves yes sometimes we don't even pray for things with thing we can do it in ourselves amen but it's not possible amen you might go a little yeah and think you are getting there like the rich young man go sell all you have give to the poor pick up your cross and follow me what I should give out my repetition I should I should I should become poor how that people look up to me that is too hard for me yes he left and he taught things were working and that is what the world do when you leave the world will embrace you but the word is not a friend yes after he left business went f for a while he broke down his bond build bigger one and call a party come let us rejoice business is good the money is here let us enjoy ourselves in that very day God said you fool oh yes you see how when you leave go you destroy yourself amen and that is what the devil want us to come to the word of God shouldn't have preeminence in our Liv yes we can you can make it yeah with your smartness you can make it yes with your education you can make it with your strength you can make it with your beauty you can make it yes but he's only doing that to get you away from the word amen for the word of God don't I mean shouldn't have preeminence yes so that by doing so you go into destruction yes he just wash you amen let him just leave the word as he did to e yes you would not surely die yes the day you eat of it your eyes will open and the woman said eyes will open as a matter of fact you'll be like [Music] God me being C wow okay the woman left the word just one word just injected one word yes let us stay with the word amen as he told Joshua told josua seven Moses is dead but still with his

fellows have left off here in the last day yes and By His Holy Spirit by his holy spirit reveal all the mysteries of the Seven Seals see he is expressing himself amen that his purpose that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second four of his three manifestation three four manifestation first to express himself in Christ then Express himself to the church and the same thing Christ was the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the church becomes the word when it let the word go through amen hallelujah the word today must be made flesh

what anything else look like I don't care if the intellectuals say this that the other it has nothing to do with it God's word says says so and we are more than able to take it well does not Hebrew 41213 say the word of God is quicker and sharper than two soul and can descend the very TSS of the mind and he was the he was that word and when that word is preeminence in the man the same thing takes place again amen if it is the word amen amen once again God has had a threefold purpose in this great mystery secret God in his great mystery secret that he had before the word begun the first thing was that God want to reveal himself to the people to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily second secondly to have the preeminence in his body of Believers amen that is that is his bride that he might live in people to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people hallelujah the see that happened to Christ yes he must do it in Sons and Daughters of God Amen and the bride is here to do that he said to manifest every promise in the last day that he promise for the last day when he gets the preeminence in
