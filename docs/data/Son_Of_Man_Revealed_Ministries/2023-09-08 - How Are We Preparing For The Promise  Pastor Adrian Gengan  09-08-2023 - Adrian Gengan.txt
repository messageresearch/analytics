more excited amen we can see scriptures coming to pass amen we can see prophecy is coming to pass and more especially we can see we are becoming more into his word image hallelujah amen yes that's our

in the house of the Lord amen amen praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus wonderful is your name amen thank you Jesus amen I notice a lot of songs were being sung about coming of the Lord and amen going away amen and I believe that's the time and hour that we're living in so we'll try to Titus Chapter two amen read from verse 11 . you speak a little thoughtful and I'll pray night service amen maybe just a little question in our title to ask how are we making preparation amen amen amen so Titus Chapter 2 verse 11 says for the grace of God that bringeth salvation at the pier to all men amen just that verse alone I just want to Rejoice because it's by Grace the grace of God and brought salvation it's not my own words it's not your words it's not our own choosing it's God who chose us therefore I can't fail Hallelujah if he shows us from before the foundation of the world how are we ever going to fail how are we ever going to fault her how are we not gonna make it amen hallelujah we have already made it yes yes if healing is to be taken by that attitude that we are already healed salvation is the same thing he that believes confess with his mouth believe in his heart amen he shall be saved so everything in this life is working by a law and it's to believe by faith so it's the same way I've already made it it's already done teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world so how are we making preparation there are we following this are we living soberly righteously and godly in this present world now what is the condition of the present world the present world is unworthy it's unrighteous amen it's in drunkenness nakedness amen looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ amen thank you amen that's what we are looking for that's where our eyes are looking and focusing now that's what we are making preparation for looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people yes zealous of good works these things speak these things amen and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee amen the Lord blessings to the reading of his word amen praise the Lord hallelujah thank you amen hallelujah amen I know we are rejoicing in the Lord amen just uh don't forget amen for those of you that were not sure maybe you've forgotten amen that uh we got some extra youth meetings coming up this weekend amen the youth meeting on the 12th at 10 30 a.m at the Emmanuel Tabernacle in Melbourne amen so it's all unmarried you welcome to attend that and uh be a part of that services amen so that's 10 30 you all remember that amen tell encourage young people to go and there'll be a light meal provided then the combined meeting has been moved forward to the 13th of August 4 P.M Durban girls Secondary School amen so just keep these meetings in prayer that the youth will be blessed in that meeting amen hallelujah so to all our Godly women the world is celebrating women's day and that's why we got the day off right so but they are Godly women amen and we thank God for godly woman if there were no godly woman we wouldn't have families yes amen we wouldn't be able to keep the morals and standards of the message yes I don't know if you're thinking about that right now but if our woman didn't support us amen yes in the gospel and in the Kingdom the woman were always co-workers in the kingdom of God you read the book of Acts that were always co-workers for the Branham says when God calls a man he calls his wife also oh I don't know if you hear it yes amen amen amen yeah yeah amen when the prophet was preaching and hammering the woman he was hammering the ungodly women right but we are to honor Godly women your wife is listening to you right now and she's not happy with your your sad amen we are to honor Godly women yes amen hallelujah woman that God is raised up in this hour Amen to stand beside us in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and I want you to know if you trace down to history you will see that women were used in the lineage of Jesus Christ women were used at his crucifixion and at his resurrection the men were scared they ran away yes if these two women didn't uh three women didn't go down there on Sunday morning the angel couldn't have told anyone he's risen yes but because some women had a concern amen they went there and they met the angel of the Lord amen amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord so women the fall came through women but Salvation has come through a woman as well Mary amen The Chosen vessel that was highly favored amongst all women amen and then you see amen how God used amen people like Rahab amen people like Ruth amen glory be to his name amen I see you very uncomfortable when we talk about godly woman and praise them amen amen you're so used to bashing the woman okay but we thank God for women so we say God bless you to all our Godly women and mothers amen they can create homes for us that we can live the gospel we can teach the gospel amen praise the Lord Give the Lord a good act of Praise come on amen Rejoice I don't know why you're like hey it's good things about women yeah come on now amen hallelujah so we we're talking here about how are we preparing for the promise how are we preparing for whatever now the promise can be anything but we are talking here we just read about the promise of the coming of the Lord right but you may be preparing for many other things in your life now you can't approach things without preparation anything in life requires preparation and we as humans are so particular about our preparations we will take a great time and strengthen and create sacrifices to make preparations for Earthly things you younger people that's in school or maybe you're preparing for exam or preparing for whatever the test you're doing you will take great pains and and go late hours into the night to study make preparation because you want to pass your test but when it comes to the things of God we don't take that same time the same pains the same efforts the things of God become casual to us yes amen we don't we don't approach him to the same fervency about sleepless nights studying the word of the Lord I know there's a few but I'm saying in reality how much of how many of us have sleepless nights because the word of God is so impressed Upon Our Hearts and all we can think about is him all we can think about is his word yes Lord amen how many of us can get up amen early parts we burn the midnight oil for an exam but how about we Burning Midnight Hour to understand this word to read his word to get closer to God amen amen but that's how we are making preparations for the coming of the Lord amen so real faith will create an expectation in you we've been talking about freed for a while now amen you know that we said that this year shall be the most Supernatural year for the church but how have you been preparing for it have you been a casual Observer waiting to see all the supernatural or have you become involved in it are you part of the supernatural acting of God Amen but real faith will create an expectation and will move you to make preparations whether you see it or not whether you see signs of it or not you will start to make preparation for it amen amen now the prophet teaches us that there are two things that control the world and that that control people that control churches controls individuals control Nations and that is fear and faith only two things he says Russia and even right now Russia is in the news he's trying to control Everyone by fear and we are trying to amen get the people of God to move into faith in this time amen hallelujah I mean if you know the thing required for the Rapture is sweet that's why it's called rapturing faith amen hallelujah so what is that if you're calling about let's say healing Faith you need to have confidence in the word of God what he says about his word that even if there is a sickness come upon the Earth today that God has never healed that sickness before follow my thought now don't base it on because God healed that person of cancer one time he'll heal me again yes if it's met on the same conditions yes but I'm saying believe the word of God so much that even if it's a new disease even if it's a new sickness he's still able to heal it because when he said we were here for all sicknesses he didn't label the sickness yes well thank you Jesus amen thank you Lord it just says bye you swipes we were healed now if you really understand the mind of God when he's saying bye you sweat you were healed he was dealing with Redemption so he redeemed man completely so that every sickness was covered under that yes so don't care what comes tomorrow thank you she'll apply the word that's why the word of God is the same yesterday today and forever thank you Lord sicknesses that exist today didn't exist probably back then but he's still the same God who heals amen so you can't have both fear and faith sometimes it happens and it cripples me but one will cancel out the other amen yes one will cancel out the other you can't be fearful and then saying I'm having free then you're like that boy walking through the graveyard whistling amen is fearful but he's whistling as if he's got faith and he's Brave amen now we also know that fear has no value to it absolutely no value because fear is useless yes amen fear hasn't got one good thing about it amen the prophet will use this example and he says if you were going to be shot in the morning what good would it do to be fearful will fear change the situation he says what good amen but he says if you have faith faith can do you some good because faith can get you out of that situation Faith could deliver you but fear won't help you amen your fear will just get you all worked up amen fear will get you more nervous amen now take that away from being shot now and into your situation some of you are trusting God for things but you are fearful you are thinking maybe God won't answer me you are thinking what in case this doesn't work then your faith is not based on the absolute that's right amen hallelujah you can't be double-minded about the things of God and about the promises of God Amen Faith could deliver you amen feel one helped me didn't Jesus tell us amen not to worry he said do not worry do not worry do not be anxious about anything worry cannot help the situation but amen what can turn it around his faith in the word of God amen so we got to stay in the right atmosphere of faith amen anybody that's coming to India your atmosphere of Faith you've got to tell them hold on hold on hold on now that's right I'm trying to live in this world of perfect faith and you're trying to bring all your unbelief and negativity around me I will have none of it amen you go change your atmosphere and then you can talk to me yes don't allow people to change the atmosphere around you yes thank you Father amen hallelujah at work they play music and it creates a bad Vibe and a bad energy so I got them I got this guy yesterday yeah yesterday I told him please come I don't care I put the letter there and I cut the wire so there's no music coming into my office now amen yes amen we've got to stay in the right atmosphere sometimes it'll make you do bold things but you gotta stay in the right atmosphere why we're allowing these unbelieving Devils to come and intimidate us and breath in a bad atmosphere because these strong scary spirits amen but you don't care you wait to jump in the taxi you'll wait that tax you got no speakers so you're waiting for the next taxi that's got some [Music] hey so what I'm saying preserve your atmosphere of Faith you've been laboring so long to live in an atmosphere of free you can't allow other people to come now and and change your atmosphere to influence you you're supposed to build upon your Most Holy Faith amen so we ought to be progressing we ought to be able Faith ought to be measurable and faith is miserable because Jesus spoke about it amen he spoke to the disciples and he says oh yeah little faith yeah yeah then when he seen another person he says I've never seen such great faith in all of Israel so faith is miserable amen and if God had to ask you this evening how miserable is your faith how does it stand on God's feet scale amen will your faith chip the scale or if you'd wait in the balance and found wanted amen hallelujah but we're coming now into a time where we must have perfect Faith amen amen yes it's no longer just an option we've got to have perfect faith amen amen hallelujah amen so we're going to stay in the right atmosphere and you must believe in God and believe in his word as the absolute I need that to sing now from just your head to your heart that this Bible and everything that's written in the Bible is the absolute amen even if the flesh be resisted amen you believe it in your soul thank you Lord yes yes amen hallelujah God keeps his word I mean if you believe that God I mean if you have experienced God keeping his word amen he'll do that amen hallelujah God will never go outside of his word for anything whatever amen God will not change his mind about his word amen he makes it amen he gives his word once and he never goes back to change it and God promises are the best the world gives us the worst but God promises are the best amen I wouldn't be happy with any other promise beside the promise of the word of God Amen the world may think amen we are living boring miserable lives amen so no no join it no fun amen because he quit fun to drinking smoking gambling maybe a little amen drugs a partying and dancing amen that's how they quit these things but we are living the most joyous life we are living the most prosperous life Amen in Jesus Christ in his word amen amen hallelujah now the prophet is going to give us an example here and he's telling us about this doctor that he knew Sam can I get some water amen he's telling us about this doctor that we knew that he knew and this doctor's brother-in-law add cancer in the throat and he tried to operate but he couldn't get to the cancer so this man came to the prophet and he had uh Faith to believe right watch the way I'm saying it now because you must have faith to believe amen even with the Divine gift yes yes it takes the faith of the person the Divine gift is there to raise your faith up to that level that if God can know and discern a thing about me surely his word is true amen hallelujah because heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away amen the reason that we said this on Sunday the Reason God sent a Divine gift and the son of man Ministry coming to return now to the people people do not believe the Bible yes go there to get the attention again thank you brother Sam God had to get the attention again amen the message of the hour came to get us back to the word seven Church ages that come amen and they are teaching had gone away from the word of God but your karma David in the hour in the midst of Goliath amen he came amongst all denominational Giants to stay with the word of God he came to tell them that Hebrews 13 8 is still in existence he came to tell them that Mark 16 is still in existence but they didn't want to believe it amen so God gave him a gift and he said if you get the people to believe you yeah not even cancer will stand in your way so this this man got healed and hear what the prophet is saying now you're speaking to this Doctrine you know doctors are scientists and they don't believe the things of God so this doctor is telling him I believe if it went out and touched a tree and he had faith in it if you have faith you would have been healed the doctor is telling the prophetess I believe if it went out and touched a tree and said he had faith in it so the prophet stops him and he says no it won't so what is he telling you don't listen to people's nonsense stop them in the tracks correct the error yes amen if somebody is telling you where I went to this one priest and he prayed for me and stop them salvation is only through Jesus Christ healing is only through Jesus Christ amen he says no their own work he's got to have grounds for free catching a tree that Superstition the prophet is saying touching a tree superstition amen you've got to have ground by faith and Faith cometh by that hearing and hearing of the word of God amen so you can't approach the word of God like a newspaper because you can't have confidence in the newspaper that's written by man that's written based on the opinion that's based on biased reporting so God's word is not biased amen hallelujah and God is no better than his word just like how you and I know better than our world Amen Hallelujah so whatever the Bible says it's settle forever now we've got to understand this one concept how do you know you are saved you came to the Lord you asked him forgiveness of your sins you confess with your mouth you believed in your heart and you believed you are saved or if you've got any evidence of it so you're telling me you're saved by faith you believe you believe you're saved by faith grace through faith right but you get what I'm saying you believe the Lord's word you believed Jesus Christ when he said no man can come to the father except through me you believe Jesus when he said I am the way the truth and the life you took the words of Jesus and you have faith in the words of Jesus and you believed it the same way it comes to Healing you believe the scripture the same way because I'm sure there's not one of us sitting here today that doubts our Salvation the same way healing is a finished work don't doubt it believe it right you've got to come right back to know the word is the truth so whatever we established so far make the word of God our foundation it's the absolute it will never fail so we know Hebrews 4 tells us the word of God is powerful the word of God is sharp then any two-edges sword cutting amen even to the marrow of the bone and it is the designer of the thoughts and sees the intent of the heart now the Holy Ghost in you can bring any word of God to pass you hear what I said yes it takes the Holy Ghost in you to make the word manifest amen so we are living right now and we are believing and expecting God to fulfill all that he has promised in his work for this end time he has an end time being people believing his word to meet the entire conditions Amen in that condition that's virtuous so he's got to have a people so built up to withstand this end time conditions amen amen and a real expectation in our heart right now is built on thus saith the Lord we believe that we have that said the Lord just like our Noah had thus saith the Lord and he told them it's going to rain they laughed at him they mocked him and now I have to stand in the midst of a time when it never rained before and he had to preach rain amen yes you think it was easy for Noah amen but he believed God's word so much and it wasn't even the written word [Music] amen we have the written word to read it day and night and understand it and believe it and you know go over it he heard God's word once God give to give him the blueprints and he had to go about making it while he's busy preparing and making it watch the type now with us while we are making preparations the scoffers are coming scoffers are coming amen scoffers they couldn't stand in the day of the prophet and and would stand him amen with the pillar of fire in 1950 they couldn't withstand him when he told him about the seven angels in the cloud and the prophet whipped those 300 denominational breaches and now their children are mad about it yeah now that he's dead and gone well he's in the sixth dimension now the children are saying hey look how we eat our fathers let's raise up let's question this thing why don't they question it then yes when the witness was there yeah when you could have answered the question but you see Satan let it lay he said I'll bring doubt in the end time did God say did the prophet say this nice don't reason with the Enemy amen when they come ask you a question hey I've got no time for you please that's right amen I don't want to reason about this Cloud I don't want a reason about the pillar of fire yes please go your way yes yes don't even entertain it amen so just like how Noah had to build in a time where of grapes or scoffers we are building now we are building this Great Pyramid City seven steps to the king's chamber amen seven steps of perfection yes amen so we are building in this great time amen and we must build with a sword in our hand and build you remember they were building the walls of Jerusalem again they had a sword in their hand and they were building with the other hand amen so you know what the prophet is saying you know he says this is 31 years okay just wait for this power maybe you're asking the Lord for something and you're not getting an answer that you want amen maybe you're trusting the Lord for something and you are not getting the answer for what you want God won't leave you wondering amen that's what the prophet is going to bring to us now just tell me if this thing is showing for you okay you got it on the screen as well so he says this is 31 years in the ministry for me and I know what I speak of and I've never sincerely in all my life ever asked God anything with this Bible open unless he gave it to me or he told me why he couldn't do it because there's sometimes he can't give it to me because I think I want it and he knows better but he's always come and told me why amen amen now what does that tell us he waited for an answer whether it came or not but how many of us are waiting for you know most of us are using God like a lucky charm we don't really want to commit to him we just want to use him for the blessings then we know better than denominations are you hearing me we have access to the promises of God because we believe the word we can't only come to God and only focus on bless me Lord bless me Lord bless me Lord you know what you're asking him you're actually asking in disbelief you are asking God to do something that you already got don't ever pray bless me Lord bless me Lord bless me Lord he's already blessed you yes amen yes amen you know where we are in Ephesians how many of you know that that's right but the Joshua quoted in his prayer Ephesians we are blessed with all spiritual blessings but you see if you don't believe that's another promise in the Bible amen so you keep going the Lord bless me Lord bless me Lord bless me Lord you're already blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places but did you where are you blessed in heavenly but maybe you're not there in Heavenly places that's why you keep asking him I'm not talking about all of you now the person that's always asking for blessing ask yourself maybe I'm not in a Heavenly place that's why I can't attain these blessings so what the key is Lord take me to Heavenly places come on now take me to Heavenly places so I can access all of these blessings amen don't really want to approach God and say oh no I just want this Lord I don't want that no amen so teaching us here now that the prophet waiting for an answer so he was determined he was dedicated amen so to me to come just come here now and use God as a lucky charm and just think hey I'm going to say this one thing here and God's gonna answer my prayer no are you waiting on the Lord amen amen the spirit just opened that very clearly to you now amen get into Heavenly places first amen so we know that Noah had to wait where to build in the time of great scoffing right when it was there was no rain and then we we went we went into our Abraham lift his own Hometown and I just want to get to this quickly because the prophet tells you beautifully how just to just to maybe build your faith a bit he says Abraham was 75 years old his wife was 65 years old and Abraham you're going to have a baby by your wife Sarah well he went out and got all the arrangements made what we were talking about how are you preparing for the promise how are you preparing for whatever promise you are waiting for the spiritual promise we are waiting for is the body change the Rapture yes right that's the spiritual promise but maybe you've got other promises in the word of God maybe it's healing maybe it's salvation maybe it's the Holy Ghost how are you preparing for that promise Whatever You're Expecting he went out and got all the arrangements made now brother Caleb Sister Sarah you all are already expecting a baby so y'all it's easy uh for y'all to make preparations you see a court you want to buy because you know there's a baby already there it's done confirmed right you are making preparations or maybe I don't know maybe brother you haven't bought a single thing yet you're waiting to see the baby first to say okay then have you already started by so you're making preparations right you already started making preparation now when Abraham and Sarah no sign of pregnancy they are moving by faith no baby they're moving by faith only that God said I will I will give you a child right he was expecting it he was expecting the baby to come anytime will it be the next 28 days you'll know about it see the first time I imagined he said to Sarah how are you feeling dear after a month at past no difference ah I can pray for one month and wait so long I must wait you mean God don't know what I want hold on right I'm trying to get to appoint you now the first time I imagine he said to Sarah how are you feeling dear after the first month had passed no difference thank God we'll have it anyhow amen yes go ahead he started to tell Sarah now go ahead and make little booties and get the little jacket ready get the bird eye and the prince cause we're going to have it that's right I'm expecting it that's right put them in your hope chest and get ready cause it's coming what is he talking about put them in your hope chairs faces the evidence of things oh for what is hope it's your desire it's your thoughts amen he says put them in your hope chest and get ready because it's coming you see if you really believe what you're talking about you go testifying about it you want you won't care if you sound like a madman even if you don't have it like the next time somebody asks you and you believe in I know I'm bringing it down to something very final now right but please I'm just trying to bring it for a point if you are believing in your dream in your imagination that you are driving a BMW whatever M4 and whatever and somebody asks you what car are you driving if you really believe it even though you don't have it you will tell them what car you're driving you see I've got one amen for the Caleb you know I try to buy it what am I saying your confession will become an expression of your faith you go around telling everybody you go around telling everybody whether it brings you a bad reputation or not because it's faith you remember John Ryan the blind man was he could he was he still blind when he was testifying he went and told everyone praise God I'm Healed praise God I'm Healed praise God I'm Healed amen he says put them in your hope chest and get ready cause it's coming a year passed oh my God any difference here not a bit we're going to have it anyhow I'm expecting it amen God said separate yourself from your Kindle that's what you have to do a lot of times amen amen so start to look now why why why isn't the promise coming get rid of the unbelief get rid of all the the Netflix get rid of all the movies get rid of all the junk and get into the word of God get into the promises of God because I tell you if you're really desperate for God if you're really desperate for you to come to pass you will sacrifice everything for it that's what you've got to do separate yourself from a lot of unbelief amen and remember until Abraham fully obeyed God the blessing never come until he fully obeyed God he took daddy along he caused trouble he took luck finally caused trouble and then as soon as he got separated from everything he fully obeyed and when he come to full obedience then God brought the blessing so are we walking in full obedience amen are we walking in full obedience in this hour that's what God is expecting from us right just to reiterate this point now about our our attitude should be now this I want you to take it far above just healing now anything in life this should be our approach this is what I'm saying already confess it why don't you come on your own faith now being that God has proved that he's coming that is here come on your own faith and go out of the building rejoicing saying thank God I'm healed amen that's what he said yes amen amen yes so whatever it is in life whatever is in that hope whatever's in your thought desire that's what he said too already confessing Romans 10. amen confess with your mouth believe in your heart you know what the problem was in Mark 11 there what did Jesus say man had come to a point where he doesn't even believe his own word that's why he's powerless on the Earth but Jesus told him if you believe what you have said people speak and they don't believe what they say yes Jesus Is Telling if you believe what you say yes you shall have what you have asked amen I want to take you now to another another example now we all know John Ryan right but here's another man and this man had come through the prayer line and the Lord told him that uh I'll just read a bit of it maybe you'll you'll get a what I'm trying to say maybe you won't go through a whole lot of it amen but I believe amen it'll help some more of us amen what's the thing needed in this hour faith but I'm asking how are you preparing for the promise how are you preparing I'm trying to show you how you hold to the promise how you make preparations for the promise so he says little fellow pass by and said God bless God bless you brother you believe a home now let your faith make you whole passed on by like that wow no prayer amen some of us if we didn't get prayed for we'd be very discouraged I made an effort I went early I got a prayer card I go into the line I'm expecting the prophet to pray for me the brother passes through the prophet asks him a question you believe with all your heart he said I do he says go home now your faith will make you whole amen you see it's what you believe right it's what you confess the power The Authority lays within who amen come on now you got it amen the power The Authority lays with the preacher lays with us you mean we had it all along yes yes amen go home now your faith will make you whole pass them by like that yeah you come back in the line now you came back in the line because nothing happened right brother Brandon you told me I was healed and I'm still jerking so this boy when he was when he was so this man when he was a boy if they dropped the baby and he developed something called policy and he used to jump I don't know exactly what the actions is I'm just saying joking because the prophet is saying jerking but he had like maybe a nervous you know nerves got damaged or something that caused him to be this way he says brother you told me you believe me he said I do you're not acting like it now I've been preaching here for some time other brothers have been preaching here you told us you believed us yes yes I need you to start acting like it to believe what I told you well I do believe it well what are you coming back and telling me you wasn't healed see how easy it is the prophet is saying it's easy what are you coming back and telling me he wasn't healed he said well brother Brandon am I heal them I said yes sir just as you believe you are amen amen yes just as you believe you are did you believe he heard my prayer he told me if I'd be sincere when I prayed get the people to believe me that nothing would stand before the prayer you believe that yes sir with all my heart he says go on I said go on he said okay he started back a few minutes yeah he comes through the prayer line I haven't stopped yet brother Brandon now he keeps telling the prophet I haven't stopped believing he says well look I'm not taking I'm not talking about when you stop now you might not stop for a week 10 days three months four months or two years [Music] I said Abraham waited 25 years on his see is that right and scripturally you know it you believe what I have told you he said well I don't get it brother Brandon I said brother the angel of God who is declaring that I told you the truth told me this if I could get the people to believe me and be sincere when I pray he said oh I see it I see what you mean I'm already got the healing I'm just waiting for it to stop the joking to stop I said that's right I've already got the healing I'm just waiting for you to stop yes I've already got the promotion I'm just waiting for my boss to get it in his head I've already got my salary increase I'm just waiting for payroll HR to process the documents I've already got it that's right said all right said I'm Healed and went on you know and kept saying praise the Lord he was healed about six weeks to be safe so he he went back home now and he started to tell everybody he started to testify in the town that he's healed of this jerking condition and the prophet was in another meeting and he received a phone call from this boy's mother with his man's mother and she started to tell him about how this man was testifying and causing a racket in the city and telling all the friends and neighbors and everybody that he was healed and everybody was laughing at him he came here a few weeks ago saying some Divine healer and healed him he's been going around your hollering praise the Lord he's healed and everything else like that he's got the whole neighborhood talk well there's no difference in to the boy amen said now we Christian people she's beginning to tell the boy now we are Christian people as well then he tells the mother he says mother I saw blind people see I saw deaf people here I seen cripples walk away and pass through the line and he told me to believe that I was healed he said the angel told him that and what the angel told him on the other things he's right and I'm Healed and nobody is going to make me say different I'm gonna stand right with it even and said he did that for several weeks and he said he would come down and set in a chair and say well thank God for healing me just shaking his heart as he could and said the people why he got an approach the neighbors would laugh at him they'd all go saying well I guess he's healed there he goes look at him shaking now isn't that a shame that somebody has deceived somebody like that isn't that ashamed the neighbors would say well that's why I want to be arrested ought to be run out of the country for telling the boy that he says my and the lady starts to say my relative from the country what's the matter with him he got down there and some preacher got him all worked up told him he was healed he's been carrying on like that ever since saying he was healed laughing at him you know and then the mother got to laughing at him just to make him stop them even his own mother laughed at him thinking he listened to the mother said he's bringing your approach he'll never it'll never bring a reproach on testifying for what Christ died on Calvary no sir he healed every person when he died on Calgary you have to accept it he sat down then one day he came he sat on the chair he was shaking like that he kept on shaking he said he got to crying and he said we got to laughing at him and he said all of a sudden he jumped up to his feet just as still as he could be said now I'm Healed that's right God had visited him she said Reverend Brandon we made him sit down on the chair there for hours to be sure he never shook a bit we took him down to our church very noted but bad church it was broadcast right through there we took him to the church the pastor looked over him and said a notable deed has been done then we took him to the medical doctor Saturday and they examined him and there there's nothing wrong amen yes hold to it make preparation for it amen confess it believe it yes how about we making preparations for the promise amen glory be to his name amen hallelujah confess with your mouth believe in your heart amen and you shall have what you say glory be to his name amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen can God trust us because Jesus said when I come back will I find faith on the Earth why is the spirit speaking to us constantly about faith amen faith faith faith it's the time it's the season right now amen hallelujah what are we waiting for a body change right word brother Ramesh we are all waiting for it body change but notice what are they talking about in the world right now and they're talking in the perverted sense Sodom is talking about their body change their body in a perversion they're talking about body change changing it amen hallelujah so how are we preparing for the promises of God how are we preparing amen for the coming of the Lord what are we looking for what is our expectation the Apostle Paul is telling us the entireters looking for that blessed hope what are we looking for are we looking to win the lotto are we looking for the next Netflix movie are we looking amen for the next soccer game for the next Premier League match what are we looking for the Bible says where your treasure is that's where your heart is so the thing you spend the most amount of time that's where your treasure is yes you don't have to tell me a single thing you don't have to tell your wife a single thing you don't have to tell your children a thing they see it wow look at my father how enthused he gets so excited when he's involved in this thing [Music] Holy Night other times his emotions are all over the place where your treasure is that's where your heart is yes Lord now you see some of us get really excited in church then you know where our treasure is amen hallelujah now I want you to know if you've been starchy if you've been cold and formal that can change right now yes amen and God's not going to change you Force you and change you who's gonna ask for the change because the Holy Ghost is a gentleman is waiting for you to ask him yes that's right you know I was going to read the sport and maybe we'll read it some other time I don't have it here that's why I won't read it now is the prophet of God is telling you that he was sitting in the church and he saw this young lady and she's began to dance she got it from the piano and she began to dance and she was dancing and praising the Lord dancing and praising the Lord and he says I got a little critical about her he says that he went back to his church and he says you know what the spirit of God began to move there and he says before you know when he started to tap his foot and I remember he was a really good Baptist so he was coming amongst the Pentecostals amen where the spirit of God was moving amen hallelujah praise the Lord and You Feel The Beat come on now yeah amen and he says come to find out I found out why dancing is so important he says because dancing proclaims the victory that you are victorious and a victory is that you have already obtained it amen so you ought to dance and praise the Lord and thank him and give him praise with a victory amen amen hallelujah some of us have never worshiped in church some of us have never raised our hands in church some of us have never said a good praise the Lord some of us have never said amen amen thank you Jesus but that's going to change and the only person can change it is amen turn to your neighbor and say I'm going to change see now and tell them now I'm going to talk a bit more louder than that when I'm praising God [Music] the Bible says Triumph don't be ashamed be boastful we just read about a young man here amen you think fear could have got him anywhere I mean think of the embarrassment the shame that he must have been facing in that approach being laughter and you know when when normally you got a problem and you're shaking like that people are always looking at you and they treat you inferior so he had to withstand all of that I'm asking you young man younger what complexes are you facing you're facing some complexes you can't even talk we greet some of the young people here they're like yes ma'am no ma'am not even sorry I'm saying two words the answer one yes no that's it they can never make conversation back that's a complex it's not normal amen it's not normal if you think if you think that I think maybe you're not talking to me because maybe you you got so much of respect for me you're not fooling me you know what I mean then why don't I see you talking to the next brother that's a complex that needs to be eliminated there's nobody in the church that should be without a voice amen that should be without the Praises of God Amen all our communication all our speech amen should be we should not evil corrupt communication we ought to be encouraging one another in that praise the Lord [Music] let me ask you if you're saying uh I I can't send you text messages who are you sending positive and scripture text messages too who are you encouraging amen who are you encouraging I encourage you whatever Bible verse you're reading for the day post it on our group let us read it too now then you're going to see it coming on the WhatsApp group all hours of the day because people are reading the Bible different parts of the day and praise the Lord what a blessing that is yeah then we'll know hey look at this brother what he's reading wow praise the Lord hey that inspired me but now you're so dry you love Fellowship because that's what the victory presented leaves and looking afar off some of you already know because you read the word you read The Prophet's messages right you know restoration of the Braintree and the leaves types Fellowship Jesus looking from afar saw the fig tree that he had leaves Fellowship I love Fellowship love Fellowship you gain every service but when you're fruit nobody can eat of you try who says this brother this brother this brother even me don't need encouragement but when we come to eat of your fruit try amen let us not be like that say Lord I want to have the food of Jesus Christ I want to have the fruit of Christ Lord Lord there I read about the fruits of the spirit Lord Jesus go and find when we talk about these things how many of you know where the fruits of the spirit are written in the word if you don't know go and look for it I know you're a masters at Google you'll even not use voice recognition talk then say and saying gifts of the Spirit nine fruits of the spirit hey let Google work for you technology so next week we're gonna test you on the fruits of the spirit everybody say amen amen with the gesture on the fruits of the spirit amen glory be to his name amen the fruits of the spirit then we'll test you on the five office gifts see if you know the five office gifts what scripture it is because if you're going to read what the five office gifts were supposed to do believe me you'd be knocking on the five office tickets was because the key to you achieving all that you're supposed to in this hour is through the five office gifts yes right so we know this spiritual gifts in the church as well amen but I'm saying how are you making preparation or what we are preaching week in week out week in week out are we wasting our time or are you really making preparation are you really making preparation you

faith is a must faith is compulsory in this hour you can't live without faith if you're living without faith you are living a defeated life because Faith looks at the Unseen amen Faith looks to the Unseen and it brings those unseen things into the real world Faith looks Faith believes Faith holds faded muscles faith has hair on its chest faith is strong faith is Burly faith is boastful yes Faith does not back down amen oh you know I love this when I said the prophet says God hates cows he says God can't use cowards what is a coward someone who has no feet no faith in the Army no faith in his team no faith in himself so he deserts the team deserts the Army he's a coward he said God hates cowards God hates a man without faith yeah yeah it's impossible to please God without Faith amen let's give the Lord a good answer for praise amen how about we making preparation for the promise and can we say with any promise it is finished that's how we ought to believe it any promise you are believing it's finished it's already done it's finished I've got it I've got it amen and you live it you acted you live with you acted you believe it you walk in it you confess it you believe it until
