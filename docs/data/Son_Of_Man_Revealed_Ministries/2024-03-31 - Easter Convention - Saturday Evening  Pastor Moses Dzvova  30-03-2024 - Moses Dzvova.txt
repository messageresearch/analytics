you in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we thank God for a wonderful atmosphere so without wasting much time let's go straight to the word Matthew chapter 17 Matthew chapter 17 we read from verse 10 the Bible says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come amen so they knew that Elias was supposed to come and we all know that Elijah God loved the spirit of Elijah that it had to come five times are we together it came on the original Elijah and it came on Elisha with a double portion I believe that you and me we are the Elisha with the double portion I remember Elijah said Elijah said what must I do before I am taken away from you and Elisha said I want a double portion and Elijah said you have asked for a heart but nevertheless if you see me going you are going to receive that double portion so I also want to say if you see me preaching until I head over the service to the pastor then you receive your desires if you sleep I'm not responsible if you see me amen hallelujah praise God are you happy [Music] are you under expectation amen let's continue and his disciples ask him saying why they say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall face come and restore all things so what must Elijah do Elijah must come and restore all things hallelujah amen Elias must first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias is come already and they have and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listen likewise shall also the son of men suffer of them we may be seated may God bless you amen hallelujah amen so I'm not saying they should increase the volume but I think it's a draging me a little bit maybe it can be tuned a little bit amen so how many are been blessed how many are under expectation amen praise be to God yeah it's more like yeah so how many a b bless so I just want to read a a quotation where I'm going to take my my text hallelujah amen so we just want to just give a small title just want to give a small title amen we are talking about the long awaited restoration and the final quickening for long awaited restoration are we together I will restore says the Lord do you love him so we are talking about his long awaited restoration are you there for restoration huh some of you you know restoration you can touch it in different aspects hallelujah amen so in the message a resume of the ages brother Bram says this age started just after the 10 of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to be the [Music] bride she the bride she was at Pentecost can I repeat it again this age as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride we must be the bride there is a difference between the bride and the church Noah was the type of the church he went through the tribulation but Enoch was the type of the grind he was rapted are we together so when I think about you know when you bought an aeroplane there is a business class and the economy are we together but you both reach the Destin are we together but those who are in the economy they will be in the tribulation they have to go through rigorous processes checkins and this and that but those who are in the business class they are treated special are we together they don't go through hassles are we together just like our Pentecostal friends some of them will be there they will make it but they will make it VI the tribulation but you and me are we together the same are economy others are on the business class so Noah was in the business class you know was in the business class huh are we together and Noah was in the economy he went through the what the tribulation the bride will not go through the tribulation are we together there is no man that wants to make his wife to serer so you are Mrs Jesus are we [Music] together can I say this before I continue you know my brothers sisters you understand this I don't care whether you have a stit husband but when the time where you are pregnant that's where you take advantage HH you just say you see my tmy I need ice cream my pregnan needs McDonald the husband will buy even if you say I need some mango your husband will climb the tree to hear what I'm saying because you are pregnant with his seed so during these meetings you must you miss Jesus the prophet says that the bride will never be impregnated she's already pregnant with the world I am pregnant and Jesus Christ is responsible how many can say I said my pregnancy want my husband the Lord Jesus Christ will die are you [Applause] [Music] pregnant so that's what I'm saying I need the token say I need the power my husband the Lord Jesus Christ sisters take advantage how many can say am are you happy do you love him amen the bride won't go through the tribulation are you happy like I said I just want to see how I arrange my things but like I said a corruption won't set in hallelujah amen God bless you Pastor n hallelujah how many love our elders God bless you all the God's generals I appreciate you Hallelujah I am not worthy are we together but it is just falling my Lord amen so now let's H read quickly hallelujah amen we are talking about the restoration the long awaited restoration listen this age started just after the 10 of the 20th century as it was to be in the age in which the true church would return to be the bride she was at Pentecost we know that huh they must of necessity be a return of dynamic [Music] power the master of necessity be a return of dynamic power how many say these me they must of what of necessity being a r of dynamic power hallelujah oh how are going to keep the fire ping how many are going to keep the fire ping tell your neor and say come on say amen hallelujah let's create an atmosphere because it is the anointing that breaks the Yoke everything needs an atmosphere do you love [Applause] him we know we know that they must of necessity be a rain of damic power then the prophet says the Believers s this in their spirit and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century listen now what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gift of the spirit listen now so people they were sensing a return of dynamic power so as they sensed the return of dynamic power some Believers started prophesying started speaking in Tong are we together the gifts of the Spirit they were now in operation but watch now are you there God bless you listen it it was then believed now it's good can amen it was then believed that this was indeed H the long awaited restoration so this is a tou one now I hope I have to say this humbly past name I'm not against the N spiritual gift I'm not against anything but I want you to hear what brother bam says people my brother God bless you as people were manifesting the gift speaking in Tong they thought that was the long awaited what restoration then the prophet says it was not so why we are here Pastor the manifestation brother es the manifestation of the N spiritual gift it's not the long awaited restoration is that right no I just want to hear an amen is that right it's not me are we together it's the prophet is it wrong to speak in Tong no are we together even in my church there is some sometimes sometimes when the Holy Ghost comes down sometimes a sister Rises up speaks in tongues say the lord it's Pastor MOS speaking it's me do you hear what I'm saying and we thank God for that are we together but it's not what the long awaited restoration after we speak in t we have to go higher we need a religion we need something that is more than the N Spirit of gift the prophet says T is the list of the N spiritual gift how many say Amen but you love him I remember the Prophecies of d h you have chosen the narrow a huge portion of Heaven be and even when I was listening to the TS some of the TS you would hear Tong being spoken how many can say Amen it's not a crime it's not a sin even to maybe after I finish preaching someone gets inspired and speak in Tong it's still correct but if you say that's the long awaited restoration that's when the era comes how many say how many are being blessed amen I know we are traing on thin eyes you know when we touch about these things we are trading on what on thin eyes Hallelujah but let's continue do you love him it was believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration the prophet says it was not for the latter rain came can can come only after the former reain after the former reain which is the or teaching rain Hallelujah the latter rain huh the L rain then is the harest rain HH how could this this say how could this be the real thing which real thing the manifestation of the gift so brother says how could this be the real thing when the teaching R had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and take the hearts of the children back to the pente fathers it's not yet comeall are you not going to Stone me are you not going to sto me is there corruption as yet are we message of the hour hallelujah amen God bless you CH you are a wonderful audience I don't feel some resentment Hallelujah you can take the word may God bless the pastors you know sometimes Pastor visiting ministers when they see people jumping shouting they feel they are more powerful but they don't know that it is the local pastors that laid the foundation I was hearing Pastor M said pastor Moses what you are preaching it's exactly what we preaching in our church even Pastor who is this Adrian he was say Pastor Moses if you had what we were preaching in our church you just came exactly Hallelujah do you understand my brother my so it makes us my job to be easier because we are in familiar hallah ground so let's clap hands for our pastors you are making my job to be easy hallelujah amen God bless you pastors Hallelujah God bless you I won't be fooled to think that I'm powerful how many can say Amen it is the pastors that have planted the seeds amen so let's continue he says the latter rain then is the harest rain how could this be the real thing huh let's jump listen are you happy he says the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and take the heart of the children to the pente fathers had not yet come that's L that's what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the rure it's not come so the final wecking how many can say amen and the restoration is not the ni spiritual gift though it is good as good as the gifts are I'm just reading I've not added anything I'm just reading Hallelujah can I repeat it again that's what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Raptor it not come Hallelujah in it oh oh oh he says in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifestation in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you in it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that was not the real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized and wrot their unscriptural doctrines and built their own F season as every other group ahead of them did how many are being blessed that's why I'm saying the LA awaited the LA awaited restoration and the final quickening is it thanks your gift the long awaited restoration is it the is it the speaking in Tong can I hear [Music] again so I can continue but is it wrong is it wrong for people to speak in Tong yes hallelujah it's there are we together it's a portion of the word of God are we together we can't say we don't want to hear someone speaking in Tong no when God wants to speak are we together God is Sovereign are we together what we can only do is to make sure it is done according to the [Music] order you know they was a certain brother in a meeting like this it was a wonderful meeting a convention and then he just stood up in the last day of the meeting and he spoke in tongues he broke in tongues and there was no interpreter and the elders who knew the word that they must be an interpreter they said brother there's nothing wrong that you spok in Tong but why is it there was no interpreter and you know what the brother said the brother said I thought that such a good meeting like this could not end without time how many do you see now it's not for sure of it has to be God and if God can use somebody to speak in Tong you can feel it you can see this is God hallah how many can say Amen do you love him can iue he said no no no no these were wonderful meetings they should not end without a turn we don't play like go with God like that are we together this is serious business oh friends the long awaited restoration so like I said pastor N I don't want to go in circles I just want to go go straight to my message Hallelujah huh restoration can I say this Malachi 4 did not come to restore gifts he did not come to restore prophecy Malachi 4 came to restore the [Applause] word how many believe that [Applause] H what is restoration do you see this B here it's here are we together if I drop it down here are we together it's not restoration if I'm saying I'm restoring the Bible I have to put it back where it was are we together friends the prophet says restoration is bringing back to the former instead listen the fall did not happen at Pentecost how many can say Amen the fall did not happen in Street the fall did not happen in the days of Jesus where did the fall take place the fall took place in [Applause] EG is that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the prence then number three a restoration of e can I say this past name we are going to that fire [Applause] Pentecost how many can say Amen we are going where to it but fire what when we are at Pentecost when we speak in Tong we thank God when we prophesy we thank God when the gifts are manifesting among our presence we thank God but let's not put a full stop we are still on our way we have not yet arrived how many can say Amen when we are Pentecost if we are but when we are at Pentecost we are in the right direction how many can say we are in what we go to Pentecost fire how many can say Amen the gift are a sign they are a sign post that appointing you to the destination I once preached a message in my church signs and destinations do you believe it hallelujah how many say Amen do you love him amen huh the restoration of the word are we together the long awaited restoration are we together do you love God hallelujah don't be offended how many can say Amen when you hear someone speaking in T it's still fine are we together when someone prophesies it's still fine but if someone says speaking in times is the Bri Revival how many say can I read this in the message that they see Hallelujah can you say Amen am can you say hallelujah hallelujah can I continue a little bit are we still free from corruption are we still free from corruption let's continue paragraph 182 I like this quotation the prophet says Pastor now that's what the reason today that is revivals that we are supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real steering says no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we hav't oh theyve got millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowh amen oh no so we have been having denominational revivals thinking is the pr I'm reading it's not me how many can say amen and then let's continue then the prophet says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to steer the bright see we are looking for it now even during these meetings I am looking for the real restoration for the real price Revival Hallelujah he says now it will take those seven ano there to wake up again see yeah he will send it may God send it this meetings may God send the how many can say we want something which is higher than the chance something which is higher the gift the word is in the Bri and she has the Lord Brother can I say this huh just ification L sanctification Wesley restoration of gift Pentecost we are still going higher that's why I sent Pastor n the bride we are Pentecost plus how many love [Applause] that Pastor es P plus we have justification sanctification restoration of gift and adoption how many can say Amen we are astronauts Lu was W automobile how many can say Amen Pentecost a but you and me we are astronauts listen to what I want to say H I'm not against gift but I'm talking about speed and accuracy do you hear what I'm saying the C is going what higher and higher adoption the de PO is higher than the restoration of gifts do you believe it can I say this Luther was using horses and PES are we together if you want to use a was from Hari to De the might die along the way and then when you use the the automobile the car it can take 3 days maybe that's better but if you use now an aane just 2 hours you are in what in t but if you use an as if you use an astronaut listen people say there is many ways of giving a kid are we together so I'm talking about different types Hallelujah of Transport my brother Lu used what the was W went and otif fire the Pentecost went and otive also fire it was aeroplanes now H so listen if you want to cling to the tong and gift and refuse huh the astronaut wait how many say Amen H I said if you want to use a car let's be honest will you choose a car to come from to yet there is an let's be honest so when I'm talking about this I'm not saying when we lay hands on you when we perform the gift you won't be healed you will be healed but it will take time to hear what I'm saying if I want to pray for everyone here all of you will be healed but I will sweat I will be tired if I want to pray for this sister here from and then I want go I one hour chasing away that demon then I catch another one from P the demon in Jesus name in hour with that one then I hold another one from 2 hours when I finish everyone here what if I go to my IDI brother how many can say

Bright Tree it was in a better condition huh remember there was fruits representing the fruit of the spirit is that right and there was leaves that represented Divine Fellowship there was a B brother says it represents the do of the church and there was a life so brother Bram says there was an insect is one insect changing form it started as a Palmer and it became a Locas are we together and it became a can then finally it became a cater one insect from a pal to a low to a to a so the prophet says that the the pal ate the Ro are we together and then when it changed Hallelujah can you say Amen keep the fire P say seek Him Hallelujah when it became a loc it ate the leaves there was no Fellowship anymore are we together and then when it became a conquer it removed the doctr of the church

can you say hallelujah hallelujah I almost spoke in Tong how many can say Amen the atmosphere is so good is that right so listen Paul when he left the se he left that Bright Tree in the only thing that was remaining was the head stone was the cap Stone that's why Paul says I know in part I prophesy in part that when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away what was

watching baseball no he was giving examples that could relate John the Baptist was giving examples of snakes are we together and Grasshoppers and that's what he was seeing how many say he says M will be revealed in the last day when the seven Angel's message listen not when he starts out doing this part when he begins to sound his message not when he starts out doing what peace but when he begins to sound his message not the yes in PR but when he begins to sound the message these Mysteries then will be revealed and here they are not knowing them and you people are a witness of that Luther pre justification wesle sanctification the Pentecost the restoration of gift but William Bram he preached that dead pool he preached the seven se he preached the token so here Dro something he's speaking about the years of preparation do you hear what I'm saying so it means in the message there are years of preparation even when you are eating breakfast when you are eating a certain course menu we go to the hotel how many can say Amen you start with STS brother es they give you BS they give you soup so if you don't know if you have not been in a hotel you will be full with a soup with a BS with

Lord PR Lord I don't want to be full with the stat I want the seven [Music] coor there is years of preparation listen H every service has got quiet time s service that's preparation then the main preaching that's the most important thing so some people come they are quiet praying reading very nice when people are seeing it they dancing and everything when Pastor ad comes to preach they sleeping why you are full with the status you have forgotten the main thing one thing is needful Hallelujah Hall preparation so can I say this I said PR justification sanctification CA restoration of gift re will adoption po s seal but watch now when Mali came on the seene I want to explain the years of preparation Hallelujah Mal 4 a Ministry like John the Baptist do hear that there a Ministry like Elijah of the Bible so Elijah and the prophets of there was a message that was supposed to take place what was the message the god that answers with fire let him be the God so the prophets of they cut themselves they shouted they did this can I say this H God is Not brought down by [Applause] emotions but God brings my emotions do you hear they shouted they jumped but nothing happened and in the evening time in the evening time Elijah came on se he said you guys huh your God is he offline has he run out of data he was smoking there go read the Bible and then listen Elijah did not just right he started by the preparation the years of preparation He restored the altar hallelujah hallelujah hallah the years of preparation are we together friend maybe the preparation took 90% or 99% or 90% when everything was in order he just offered a 30 second prayer father I've done this according to your word Let the Fire Fall and fire William from 19 83 to 1962 he was in the years of preparation he has not yet preached his [Applause] message hallelujah hallelujah can you say Amen that message of we brother was the message of the Dead po was the message of the seven seal the prophet says for this alone the mysteries of God is the ministry of the S AG the seven Angel is the messenger are we together of the seven seal do you believe it do you believe it in the days of the voice of the seven age when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished yes how many can say the ministry of Elijah is the ministry of mysteries we are called by the how say the ministry of the seven messenger is to preach and open the mystery of the seven seal and call out that our change awakers [Applause] Hall that's the message of William the revelation of the seven SE We Don't Preach from a closed book but the Pentecost house the Ang all these churches they are preaching from a closed book Because when the priest huh opened the book the book was given to Jesus open and Jesus read and said this day this scripture is fulfilled and Jesus closed the book and Ed it over to the Catholic PRI and that book has been closed ever since so they were preaching from a closed book but you and me in 1963 I saw another come down with an open book we are preaching that this is an open book [Applause] [Music] Ministry amen hallelujah hallelujah can you say hallelujah hallah can you say praise the Lord the Lord for his message is the seven but when he came listen when he came on the sin H he saw people baptizing in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost he saw sisters preaching he saw things which were in order so will when he came he could not put the headstone he could not preach the seals when there was no old that's why he started making [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he say say is this the [Music] time it his message which he suspended things were not in order but when he saw that everything is now in order the leaves are there the fruit of the spirit are there the do is there the life is there and Willam says say is this the time the time for Hallelujah the time forward the time of preparation is over now let's get into the message can you say hallelujah hallelujah can you say praise the Lord say is this the time he said the time is come to teach the church the deeper things of God and R off this me Bel and get into something real how many can say say is this the [Music] time there is years of preparation but it's not his message okay can I shock you who preached and said women should not put on trousers who said that who said women should not pleas put on huh it was Moses in the Old Testament are we together who said women should not preach it's po so now what did William so you mean will a message he's preaching the message of Moses he preaching the message of Paul do you see what I'm trying to say is with his message but why was Willam Bram talking about women preaching why was he talking about TR us he was reped the all do you hear what I'm saying that's why he preach said the restoration of the tree what was he doing he wanted to bring back the P tree to the level where so when was saying hey you come to a church there's no fut GI what was he doing he was putting the fruits again you see the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] am Pastor it was time for what to Beed it was time for to have another says is this the time of my message is this the time to reive the seven ders to open the seven SE how many say may God bless you chur do you believe it the years

we together he took a crow hit top of the mountain and there was white green night where the Sun never shined and Willam says look on this while I go west while I go what West to bring the interpretation while was going west he looked with a corner of his eyes he saw brother what going with the St they enjoyed the STS and went away until there were only few people who were remaining so when you hear people saying that s was not opened just say you are the person that lived before the interpretation came if you ex Mal 4 was going to come with interpretation and the prophet says there was an angel which was notable which was on my right swep swep to how many can say that was a who was that [Applause] angel who was that angel oh hallelujah praise be to God the long awaited
