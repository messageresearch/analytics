denominations yes our Redemption is not in part our Redemption amen he comes to show us that we are part of him amen amen our Redemption takes us past Lu's justification yes Lu's justification says

be here amen amen amen so don't worry about who's not here amen he specifically ordained you to be here amen so he has something in store for you Hallelujah it seems like amen the a portion of uh hell is running loose with the flu amen and affecting everyone with the flu but nonetheless his grace is sufficient for us hallelujah amen we pray we be blessed with the word tonight amen let's turn to the Book of Exodus 2:23 amen we don't have the projection or anything tonight so we'll just try and go slowly through the scriptures and the quotes So that you catch it amen Exodus 2:23 Bible says during that long period the king of Egypt died the Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out and they cried for help because of their slavery went up to God God heard their groaning and he remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob amen he's the god that remembers his promises amen verse 25 so God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them amen so we read in verse 23 once again amen you the Israelites they groaned in their slavery and they cried out to God they cried for help because of their slavery went up to God so in 23 if we are to read it another way in 23 the children of God started to cry unto God Amen because of the slavery that latest year had put them in amen because of the slavery that through the years amen the enemy has tried to get a hold of God's people but God's people begin to cry they begin to consecrate them El they begin to Res surrender themselves amen amen and then in 24 God says I've heard they're groaning I have heard the people crying unto me amen now here is coming God's glory amen because he's he he has heard the Cry of his people and he says I have remembered my promises Amen in other words I remembered the promises I made to my servant ranom amen that this people will share in my glory that this church will be super race there'll be an invincible Army amen that this bride will not fall am amen God says I've remembered my promises and then look in verse 5 25 he says God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them amen God is concerned about you amen God knows the struggles you go through amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so for our topic tonight we just want to talk on about the final Vindication of William bram's message the final Vindication amen now I could have titled this the final Vindication of Malachi 4's message and that's what I had initially but then I said to myself why must we be ashamed of the name amen you know when we referring to John the Baptist we refer to John the Baptist we don't refer to Malachi 3 yes we're not ashamed of the name John the Baptist because he f full Malachi 3 so William brandom and for those listening on the online audience and who might not know who we're talking about William Brandon fulfilled the scripture of Malachi 4: 5 and 6 hallelujah amen so when we are talking about Malachi chter 4 we are referring to William brandom amen so we want to know tonight what is the final Vindication of William Brandon's message amen amen thank you Lord we see here here was the children of Israel in the book of Exodus and we know how they they got into this condition after years of Joseph passing away they Rose a pharaoh who knew not Joseph amen amen and the people of Israel started to work for the Egyptians as slaves and the Egyptians started to treat the children of God very badly they started to be heavy task Masters obviously it didn't just start like that it must have started with the Israelites just working normal jobs But as time went on the Egyptians saw the productivity of the children of God they saw how blessed they were amen they saw that everything they put their hand to they were blessed at and so they thought to theel how can we cultivate this now and so they put the children of God under slavery and so the children of God begin to cry out they begin to cry out to God Amen and now in this message I also want to show you in this message that when God delivered the children of Israel it was not just God who was in the form of the Angel right the pull of fire and it was not just Moses I'm going to show you that a there was a Aaron also in the picture amen when it came to the Deliverance of the children of God from Egypt in the first Exodus it was God with his Prophet with Aaron and a what does Aaron type Aaron was the priest the levitical order so Aaron typed the priesthood so Aaron typed the fivefold ministry one Aaron also typed the children of God because the priest stands on behalf of the children of God Amen right so we want to show you that Aaron types the priesthood he types the children of God he also types at one point in his ministry he types the Fallen church as well and we're going to show you that amen but my point is that when Deliverance came to the children of Israel it was not through Moses alone amen now here was the people of God and they cry begin to come out to God and God is hearing their cry now because remember we said we don't serve a god that is deaf amen we serve a God that hears we serve a God that knows all things amen and he made a promise amen that these people were going to soier in a Strange Land for 400 years amen and he seen that the time has now approached and the children of God begin to cry out you'll notice always when there's going to be a change of dispensation there's a cry out in the children of God why because there's an instinct within them telling them that there's a change of dispensation amen so they begin to cry out to God and God says I have heard they cry God says he's he cares for his people amen amen see God sees you in your situation yes whatever you're going through maybe you're going through hardships maybe even at work you going through hardships amen maybe you're coming under a heavy task master at work amen and you're crying out to God why can the situation change or why can't things be better but God hears your cry amen and God has Deliverance for you amen maybe you are enslaved by the things of the world and you struggling with sin maybe you're struggling with weakness you're struggling to overcome amen later has it hard on you amen Satan has got his 200 milon demons as task Masters over you amen and he's trying to bring you down every day you're trying to climb back up and serve God and then he wants to knock you down amen but God says I have heard the Cry of my people amen yes amen God cares for you amen amen amen oh no matter what it is maybe you're facing you've been facing sickness for years and you can't seem to be get to get Deliverance out of a certain situation but God says I care for you thank you Lord amen I know that my grace is sufficient for you remember when Paul cried out to the Lord and he said my grace is sufficient for you amen God never let his prayers go unheard the same with William brandom he cried out to God to heal him for a certain sickness all those years and eventually God sent him the seven Dove amen because God cares for you amen hallelujah amen amen in Exodus chapter 3 and verse 7 the Lord said I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and I'm concerned about their suffering see once again God is is expressing his concern to Moses so I have I have come down he says I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them out of the land into a good and spacious land so once again even like when the when the Hebrew boys were in the father God himself came down amen because when the children of God are in trouble amen God doesn't send anyone else but himself he comes down himself amen because he is the Redeemer thank you amen he is the mighty Redeemer so when his children is in trouble God comes down himself amen amen and and look what he wants to do now he wants to rescue them from Egypt and he wants to bring them into a spacious land a land flowing with milk and honey oh amen the home of the Canaanites and so forth amen so God doesn't just want to rescue you from your situation God has a better plan for you amen amen he says I know the plans I have for you plans to prosper you amen that you be in good health amen that you prosper in the natural things that you prosper in spiritual things that your soul Prosper amen God cares for you that much that he doesn't just want to rescue you but he wants to provide for you he wants to be your provider he wants to be your healer your sustainer your comforter amen he to bring you out of one condition and take you into a better condition amen amen hallelujah that's the God we serve yes and now the Cry of the Israelites has reached me and I've seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them amen 200 million demons oppressing the people verse 10 so now here's what God says now so now I am going to send you to pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt now first God said I coming down but now he says I am going to send you so how is Deliverance coming how is God going to bless you yes how is God going to rescue you amen how are you going to overcome the task masters of latera that wants you enslaved amen God is sending a message with his Prophet yes amen amen we sing the song our Moses has already gone to prepare the place amen he brought us through the Jordan and he was taken away amen hallelujah overcoming power is what we have have in this hour amen so all your blessings are tied to that to the message of the hour amen how is your deliverance coming via the message of the hour amen God is sending a Vindicated message he's sending a Vindicated Prophet yes and in that God is said I am coming down amen amen hallelujah huj and your deliverance can only come through that this is why in Malachi 4 he says behold I send you yes and notice before he says behold I send you Elijah he says remember Moses why because in like manner God went to deliver the children of Israel in the time of Moses just like how he sent Moses with a message a strong and of Deliverance amen a onean Invasion hallelujah amen in this age God sends a one man evasion amen he sends him seven times around the world Hallelujah and in this message he's coming Deliverance for God's people to deliver them from the task masters of L Hallelujah behold I send you and four speaks of Deliverance amen hallelujah amen so God is sending Deliverance via a message amen and when the people receive the message they are receiving their Deliverance when they received Moses they was receiving their deliverance and when they refused Moses amen judgment Came Upon them so let let's look at Aaron's involvement now we say that God speaks to Moses right God meets him in the pillow of fire and God is commissioning him and Moses begins to I want say argue but he begins to reason with God and he says God why if they don't listen to me my speech is you know not that good I'm I have stammering speech I'm not I'm not good with speech why do they don't listen to me so God now begins to get angry with Moses and eventually God tells Moses use your brother Aaron right and God says to Moses that you will be a god unto Aaron and Aaron will be your Prophet amen let's read that amen the Lord and the Lord's anger burned against Moses and he said what about your brother Aaron the Levites amen the priest now the ministry I know he can speak well amen this is what God is saying about the ministry now I know that he can speak well amen amen he is already on his way to meet you and you'll be glad to see you you shall speak to him now God is saying Moses you shall speak to him and put words in his mouth amen so the words in the ministry in the fivefold ministry those words have been put there by the prophet of the age why because he said say what the tape say amen he store the message up in books and tapes and he says stay with what the tape says amen and he says I will have both of you speak and will teach you what to do so God is not only going to help Moses God is going to help Aaron as well amen God is going to be with the fivefold ministry as well amen he will speak to the people for you you see the prophet is already left the scene he's no longer here amen and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him and God says but take the staff in your hand so you can perform signs with it now look the Lord said to Aaron now now the Lord appears to Aaron and he says go into the Wilderness to meet Moses you see the fivefold ministry has also has to come to the backside of the desert amen they also have to have that experience where they come to the backside of the desert and he has to meet Moses at the Mountain of God amen amen you see the ministry also has to come to the Mountain of God where the angel met the prophet why because we also have to connect with the same angel amen amen oh yes Lord amen hallelujah you see the fivefold gets the instructions from Moses by the books and tapes amen it's recorded spiritual food stored up in due season because it says yeah and Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had sent him to say and also about all the signs he had commanded didn't he tell us about the two signs the first pool and the second pool and then he explain to us about the third pool amen [Music] and Moses and Aaron brought together all the Elders of the Israelites and now watch now Aaron told them everything the Lord had said to Moses so Moses is not telling them Aaron is speaking to the people of God and Aaron is bringing to them what God said to Moses amen amen because the prophet says young man will come and carry this message onto the coming of the Lord and they will make sensory to the people amen hallelujah amen that's right and then the people believed and when they heard that the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their Mery they bowed down and worshiped amen hallelujah yes amen now let's go on further to in the story to see now how Aaron now starts to take on his role in Exodus 11:10 Moses and the Bible says Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh but wait now I thought that Moses performed all the signs and wonders but here the Bible saying Moses and Aaron performed all these signs and wonders before pharaoh and Pharaoh hardened his heart and he would not let the Israelites go out to the of the country Exodus 5 verse3 then they said the god of the Hebrews has met with us now let us take now this is Moses and Aaron speaking to pharaoh and they say to Pharaoh now let us take a three-day Journey Into the Wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord Our God or he may strike us with plagues or with The Sword and the king of Egypt said Moses and Aaron why are you taking the people away from their labor get back to your work then Pharaoh said look the people of the land are numerous and you are stopping them from working that same day Pharaoh gave this order to slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people to say you are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks let them go and gather their own straw Now watch how the enemy gets angry when God is coming down to bring Deliverance to his people amen Pharaoh begins to make life much harder now for the Israelites why because Moses and Aaron tells Pharaoh we want to go for a three-day Journey To Worship in the wilderness and Pharaoh begins to tell them let them make more bricks the same amount of bricks but with no straw don't provide the straw for them but require them to make the same number of bricks as before don't reduce the quota and he says they are lazy that is why they are crying out let us go and sacrifice to our god so look at pharoh now he saying this people don't want to do their work they want to that's why they want to go and worship their God and so he says make work harder for these people so that they keep working and paying no attention to liar so now look at this why is Pharaoh making their lives hard what's the number one reason he he doesn't want them to go and worship their God and this is the same Spirit now in later amen when we want to worship God we want to have time for God Amen we want to read our Bible we want to pray but the Same Spirit of pharaoh he saying no make them work harder make them focus on their careers make them focus on material things amen make them focus on obtaining more and attaining more amen look at our F saying they lazy and look at how the world wants to encourage you know don't be lazy work more work more hours work over time amen get more get more into debt hey man look what does straw do to a brick so in those days they made bricks via clay and Clay takes very long to dry so they put straw in the brick because the straw opens up the clay and allows you to dry faster so the brick is made quicker so by Pharaoh taking out the straw it took them longer to make these bricks you see so that's the in the same way that is how later works it says let's make things harder for them so they have to keep working let's increase the mortgage bonds let's let's increase the interest rates let's make the cost of living higher so they have to work over time they have to only focus on material things just to survive no amen you end up working for years and years and years just to pay off your house by the time you pay off your house you're already old man amen look at the Same Spirit now that was driving the children of Israel and why because he wanted to stop them from going on a three-day Journey you see the children of God wants to go on a three-day Journey from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost but lateria wants to restrict you from doing that why because when you go from those three stages you begin to form into the word image amen you begin to become a new creation in Christ Jesus amen and you begin to put on the very image of Goden you become an adopted son of God Amen and Pharaoh can see if this people go and worship amen they are going to start to get an identity of who they are again amen we have now cultivated in their minds that they are slaves we have spent years and years and years to influence them and to make them believe believe that they are slaves yes amen but now if they go on this three-day Journey they are going to start to get an identification again amen they're going to start to realize who they are and once they realize who they are they can start to become like a great nation again amen he says they are great number he knows that they can be a very great nation so he wants to keep them trapped amen he wants to keep them with spiritual Amnesia so that they don't know who they are they continuously believe they are slaves but little did he know that this were the children of God yeah amen they were like that slave who do not forget his identity amen amen they knew the identity as children of God that is why they cried up unto God Amen they remember what promises God made to their forefathers amen amen so they cried out unto God but remember in as much as Pharaoh was hard on them God now said I have remembered my promises amen no matter what Pharaoh can do to you God has said I have remembered my promises amen who is the Greater King he is the great king amen he puts Kings into place he puts presidents into position hallelujah hallelujah amen God says I have come down to deliver amen now let's look at Exodus chapter 7 here's Moses and Aaron again before pharaoh and it says so Moses and Aaron went to pharaoh and did just as the Lord commanded Aaron threw his staff down in front of pharaoh and his officials and it became a snake now I thought Moses threw his staff down because in the movie it shows me that Moses threw his staff down Prince of Egypt the church WIll Tau us that Moses threw his staff down and performed the signs but here the Bible is telling us Aaron threw his staff down Amen in front of pharaoh and Aaron now is performing the supernatural verse 19 and the Lord said to Moses tell Aaron take your staff and stretch out your hand over the Waters of Egypt over the streams and canals over the ponds and over all the reservoirs and they will turn to blood and Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord commanded so here again the Lord is saying tell the Lord is saying to Moses tell Aaron stretch his rod over the SE I thought Moses stretched his Rod over the Nile and turned it into blood but here the Bible is telling us Aaron did it amen amen but God is instructing Moses and Moses is instructing Aaron amen oh we seen a Synergy here between the prophet and the fivefold ministry and the people remember Aaron is also typing the people of God Exodus chapter 8 and then the Lord said to Moses tell Aaron stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt and so Aaron stretched out his hand over the Waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and cover the land once again not Moses Aaron stretches out his his Ro and performs the supernatural now here's a canundrum I thought Moses was performing all the 10 plagues now if you go on to read the rest of the plagues you'll see that in some instances Moses does do it but it's showing you that Moses and Aaron is working together here it's not just Moses performing the supernatural amen you see Moses now is telling Aaron what to do Moses is prophesying and Aaron is prophesying again am we see in Revelation 10 8-19 effect because Moses is hearing from God and prophesying and now here is Aaron coming and prophesying the same thing again amen amen see the bride and the elect also has the power to perform the supernatural amen she also has a Ministry in partnership with the angel and the messenger because what the prophet tells us that the that the bride under her Messenger will be the final voice to the final age you see Aaron under Moses was the final voice to Egypt amen we didn't see that before cuz we only saw Moses but Aaron under Moses was the final voice to Egypt Aaron had thus say the Lord or he kept still amen only when Moses Moes prophesied do this then Aaron moved a amen God spoke to Moses Moses prophesied and Aaron prophesied it again amen you see how the church amen the church has always portrayed that Moses is doing everything and even like that in the message all through the years it was all about the Prophet The Prophet The Prophet The Prophet did this the prophet did the supernatural am man they begin to idolize what the prophet doing not realizing that we were called for the same purpose to work in partnership with the angel of the Lord amen you see there's another eron on the scene now another levitical order the fivefold ministry and the people of God Amen that has now been the final voice to later see am amen amen in Exodus chapter 3 and God said I will be with you and this will be the sign to you that that I have sent you now pay attention to this because my title is what is the final Vindication of William vandam's message God is saying to Moses when when God first meets Moses he's saying and this will be to you to Moses a sign that I have sent you when you have brought the people of Egypt out of Egypt when you have brought the Israelites out of Egypt and they will worship God on this mountain so God is saying when you deliver the people out of Israel out of Egypt and you bring them to this mountain to worship that is a sign unto you that I have sent you so all the supernatural signs that Moses did the first and second pool and so forth was not a sign to Moses that God had sent him the final sign the final Vindication that Moses message was true was when the people of God comes to the Mountain of God to worship and they're delivered out of Egypt yes you see the same Mountain where Moses seen the glory of the Lord the same Mountain where Moses met the angel of the Lord the pull of fire in the burning bush amen amen the same Mountain where where Moses can come down the mountain with an open book amen when he comes in type now with the Ten Commandments he comes down with a book to the people he says when the people come to that same mountain in other words when the people begin to connect with the angel when the people comes and experience my glory yes when the people comes up to to this mountain of Glory that will be a final Vindication of your message amen now here come Psalms 24 who shall Ascend up into the hill of the Lord you see Psalms 24 we read the Earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell in and he had founded it upon the Seas amen and established it upon the flood you see the Lord is talking about the Earth the dry land here and the Seas we know this is typ in our Revelation 10 amen the the mighty Angel descending upon the land and sea amen and he said who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord amen this is the mountain now that the people of God are coming to or who shall stand in his holy place he he that hath a clean hand and a pure heart amen he who had not lifted up his soul unto vanity no Swan deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord now remember how is God we said how does God deliver you via the message amen those that receive the message and come up to the same mountain and meet with the same angel that the prophet met and connects with the same Angel amen that is going to be the final Vindication amen amen the Bible says who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle amen why he's Mighty in battle because he rescued you amen he rescued you from the Egyptians he said the Egyptians you see today you'll see them no more yes amen amen hallelujah so what is the final Vindication of Malachi 4's message the final Vindication of William Brandon's message there's going to be a people amen that begins to connect to the angel of the Lord amen there's going to be a people that begins to share in the glory of the Lord they come to the Mountain of God and Ascend up into his glory there's going to be a people that comes up to mount Transfiguration and begins to become adopted sons of God there's going to be a people amen that can come up to the Mountain of God where the open book came down the mighty angel came down amen and they can receive from the open book amen when the people are on the scene and they are manifested and they come to full maturity like Jesus Christ on Mount Transfiguration that is the final Vindication of William bram's message amen not all the the first pull and the second pull and so forth but when there's a people that comes to full maturity amen a people that comes to full adoption and notice how in this hour now God has brought a change in dispensation amen we are starting to become mature Sons and Daughters of God what are we doing we are sending up the hill we are sending up Mount Transfiguration where God can now be proud of us and start to perform the adoption ceremony amen amen hallelujah and this people is the final Vindication amen because why the bride is the final voice in the final age yes amen remember I told you Aaron is typing also the bride of Christ the people of God and just like how Aaron prophesied again the bride now is prophesying what William Brandon prophesied the bride is saying the same thing yes amen the same thing that the tape says the bride is saying we when William brand prophesy judgment upon the Earth the bride is prophesying the same things when you are telling people that Los Angeles is going to sink you are prophesying again amen when you are telling people that America is going to go up and smoke you are prophesying what William Von prophesied amen amen when you are prophesying that this bride is an invincible Army you are saying what the tape said you are prophesying what William Bram said amen so the bride is in Partnership amen you see the bride is ascending amen the same Mountain of God amen hallelujah amen amen so then there came a Time amen when Aon now types also the Fallen church we see in Exodus chapter 32 amen the Bible says when the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain amen the people begin to get worried now where is Moses where's the prophet they gathered around Aaron who is the priesthood now the the fivefold ministry the preaching the ministry and said come make us Gods who will go before us as for this fellow Moses see they forgot he is a prophet of God now they say as for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt we don't know what has happened to him Aaron answered them and said take off the gold now here is the ministry now hearkening unto the voice of the people the ministry that supped to be upholding what Moses taught them the ministry that supped to be upholding the standards of the word is telling them take off the gold earrings that your wives your sons and your daughters are wearing and bring them up to me so all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aon and we know how Aaron now started to take the jewelry and he started to form this golden calf and he started to Fashion it amen like the gods of Egypt so what did the church do when William Brandon was on the scene you had all the denominational world the churches and they started to Fashion themselves after the world the same things that they were delivered from when they came out of Egypt came out of the World when they got saved amen remember they had a genuine experience when they came to the Lord they got saved amen and they come into these churches now but now they had nowhere to go they had no Prophet amongst them why because they rejected William Brandon yeah and so they begin to influence their Ministries their famous preachers they popular preachers to form themselves Idols of the things of the world and they begin to take up the wealth of the world that is why you find all the churches that chase after money all these preachers that to chase after money and the things of the world why because they had abandoned the prophet they rejected the prophet's message amen and so now they started to hearken unto the people they knew that they needed to keep the people they wanted the numbers yes so they thought what can we do to keep the numbers so to satisfy the people they started to water down the gospel of Christ they started to take from the things of the world they started to Bob their hair they started to wear makeup this the preacher started to smoke they started to allow occasional drinking they started to amen allow all of these things to come into the church Sodom sodomites and all of these things started to come into the church amen like the children of Israel begin to do when Moses was up on the mountain receiving amen what was Moses receiving he was receiving directly from God the Ten Commandments and here was William gram he was going west Amen to receive of God the open book to receive of the Seven Seals amen but once he was coming down coming back with the Seven Seals and coming back with the open book he begins to see the people in this condition like Moses saw the people now when he came back down the mountain he saw the people in this condition a fallen church amen a church laid out in sin amen and so what did Moses do he broke the two tablets amen and he pronounced judgment upon them Amen in likewise now when the prophet now comes with the open book and the seals are open and he sees the church in this condition watch where the Prophet does he starts to preach Satan's Eden he starts to preach God of this evil age amen he starts to he starts to uh preach I indict this generation for crucifying the word again what is the prophet doing he's not in Breaking the word in opening the word and breaking the word like Moses broke the tablet he's pronouncing judgment on all those that have rejected the message amen but you see this is where the church fell amen they started to take on the things of the world this is why there's such a big responsibil uh responsibility on the ministry to make sure that they stay with what Moses said with what the prophet said amen and stay with what the T said you see they couldn't wait any longer Moses went up into the mountain and the Israelites began to get patient they couldn't wait any longer and the prophet says the Pentecostals and the denominations couldn't wait any longer they supposed to be waiting for the mighty outpouring of the Holy Ghost they supposed to be waiting for the same message that the prophet was waiting for but they couldn't wait anymore so they started to impersonate you begin to get guys like T Osborne and all of these guys that started to impersonate the prophet why because they couldn't wait yeah just like the children of Israel they couldn't wait while Moses was up on the mountain and the prophet said because they couldn't wait they begin to take all of these gimmicks they begin to take all of these impersonations and he says why take all of these impersonations when the skies are full of the Pentecostal blessings amen you see but this is what the church begin to do and they begin to idolize these things and they now said behold these are the things that delivered you out they started to make speaking in tongues the evidence of the Holy Ghost they said when you receive the evidence of the when you receive speaking in tongues you receive the Holy Ghost this is what delivered you out of Egypt you see they couldn't wait for the prophet hallelujah amen you still with me amen amen hallelujah amen amen amen so they what what do they start to do they start to influence Aon Amen to water down the gospel and what does 2 Timothy 4 says for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine yes but after their own lust they will keep amen who who's going to influence the ministry the people they will keep to themselves teachers having eing years and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and they shall be turned unto fables amen amen look at the fables now they are saying it wasn't Moses the prophet and his message that delivered you it was a golden Cal that delivered you fables amen but watch thou in all things enjoy Affliction amen Paul is telling Timothy to do the work of an evangelist and make full proof of thy Ministry and Paul is tell when Paul is telling Timothy this Paul is saying it's almost the time of my departure so it was at the ending of Paul's Ministry that he is saying that they are going to Heap TOS teaches have 18 years just just like that Moses was coming to the end of his ministry when they begin to do this just like William Brandon when he comes to the end of his ministry now the church World goes out in such a fallen condition to the point where he says I refuse to pray for them anymore he says the system is cursed and what did Aaron use to form this he used the very gold and the earrings amen that they took out of Egypt so this is a sign of showing them how they brought the world into the church they brought worldly music into the church they brought the worldly ways of doing things into the church amen amen they made everything about blessings yeah now was there anything wrong in being blessed there was nothing wrong in being blessed because remember God was the one who told Moses that when you leave in Egypt I will make the Egyptians favorable unto you that they will give you the gold and silver so God hey man what a God we serve a god of favor that will make even the heathens bless you even those that cursed you and and and was your Taskmaster God will make them bless you amen because that's the God we serve amen that's the god that we serve he will bless you by all means why you are the children of the most high God Amen so but now here Aon is taking the same spoils that God blessed them with amen and now he's making this into an idol amen so that is why amen the prophet when he comes down after breaking the seals amen he starts to preach all these messages he starts to preach God of this evil age he starts to pre Serpent's uh the serpent seed amen Satan's Eden and all of these things yes and he says I indict this generation that's exactly what Moses was doing why because the church world had fell but now whilst they had fell there was still an elect that stayed true to Moses's message amen there was Joshua and Caleb amen amen they were still the elect amen that knew that even though Moses had gone up into the mountain amen they were willing to wait for the outpouring they were willing to wait amen for what God had in store for them amen amen so just like that even though the church world had fell there was a people amen all through the years of the message amen there's been a people who's been patiently waiting amen patiently holding on to the words of the Prophet amen patiently amen 40 years 50 years 60 years in the message amen they've been patiently waiting what they've been waiting for this season amen this season when there's a mighty outpouring now of the holy spirit amen and when God is now ready to move amen now they are ready to receive of God they didn't take on the gimmicks amen over the years even in the message people uh rose up amen starting to amen call themselves The Messenger the eighth Angel and so forth started to form all of these doctrines why just like the prophet said they could not wait yeah they could not wait for the pouring the outpouring of what God wanted to do they could not wait for the Dynamics to fall upon the mechanics so they started to manufacture remember the prophet is saying Pentecost started to manufacture they couldn't wait for it so they started to manufacture it so that's what some people in the message started to do they started to manufacture they started to get hyped up over things over doctrines like the seven Thunders and virtues and all of these things they started to manufacture these things because they couldn't wait for the Dynamics to fall upon the mechanics amen because once the Dynamics falls upon the mechanics it makes it alive it makes it to live in you and I and once it's living in you and I then you don't have to manufacture anything it produces the results amen you see if it's just the mechanics alone it can't produce the results and if it's not that is why then you got to try and manufacture something but when the Dynamics is falling then the Dynamics and the mechanics together now produces the results amen but they couldn't wait amen but there's been a people of God that has been waiting and there's been a people of God that has come under preparation amen and and now is the time amen that the people of God are ready Amen to do the Greater Works amen he says the people of God will do great exploits amen amen hallelujah amen amen so just to read a few quotes amen the prophet in in in the spoken word is the Original Seed now he says a few things amen about the seed and about a people who is going to produce what was in the seed he says now there has been three different kinds of seeds planted it denominational seed by Bly gram he was the head planter Oral Roberts for the Pentecostals the Pentecostal seed has been planted I'm talking about the prophecies I'm talking about organization now and the word has been planted so three seeds went forth amen the denominational seed by buly Gram the Evangelical and so forth the Pentecostal seed by a Roberts and the prophets is the word seed amen that was planted by the messenger of the hour now this is why you cannot mix up the three because a seed can only bring forth after its own kind and if there are three different kinds of seed the three are going to produce different results amen the three can produce the same fruits amen if you think that the Pentecostals even though they have the gifts if you think that they are going to produce the word of God manifested in his hour you are mistaken amen they could only go as far as producing the gifts but there's a people who has the seed word of God that's going to produce the word seed of the hour amen amen that's going to produce the Son of God again now the prophet says now you'll have to understand folks I ain't going to say this no more unless God tells me see he's feeling checked here amen I want you to get this good and clear three seeds has been planted that's the reason the planting it's about over amen and the prophet says the seeds must be planted before the rain falls amen yes the prophet goes on to say I believe that it is near Harvest Time amen remember he's not saying it is it is Harvest time he's saying it is near Harvest time we know now we are in the Harvest Time amen the seeds have been planted the denom National seed of the churches such as the evangelicals the Baptist and Presbyterian and Lutheran and the Pentecostal seeds have been planted amen great men like Oral Roberts Tommy hick and Tommy Osborne Great Men of God and I believe that the word of God has been planted amen aren't you grateful amen that amen you know Jesus spoke about the parable of the s that went to se amen there's one that has solded the word of God unadulterated away from any of those organizations that's what's the matter the seed plant must have seed water before it can grow it must have water to fall before the seed that's planted can grow now the prophet says now just wait a minute you take the word former in Joel 2 and look at it and see if the Hebrew word which is Mora or Mora and get the Hebrew word interpreted it means teaching amen the teaching has went forth we just been revision now the teaching Reign has went forth the denominational teaching Reign has went forth they said a million more in 44 the Baptist and so on Oral Roberts and them brothers with the Pentecostal move amen they moved up into the millions see the seed has went forth the word for the minority the group now watch remember the word Mora means teaching the former Reign it says is the teaching Reign teaching rain went for polygram has struck the world the Pentecostal struck the world the word has struck the world look at these three revivals going for all at the same time planting their seeds amen going around the world planting their seeds amen three kinds of Believers amen remember but the word seed is been planted now what's the matter now she is now waiting for the latter rain that's when she produces her fruits amen amen so we've had years and years of the teaching reign in the message amen we've been taught the word we've been disciplined in the word we've been taught all of these things all of the doctrines of the message Cod and all of these things we've went through the teaching rign which is the former Reign amen but the latter rain now is what causes us to produce the fruit the results now he says I hope you get her then the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of trop you will reap amen amen amen yes so if the word is planted in you you can only produce that kind of a fruit amen amen then that kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap if the denomination if the doin denominations wants more members that's what they're going to get that's what they've got the Pentecostal wants more Pentecostal that's what they're going to get but the word is going to introduce Sons and Daughters of God Amen do we have sons and daughters of God in this hour amen why because there was a prophet planting the word seed amen you see you do understand that only because there was a s planting the word seed you can come forth in this hour amen because only the seed that was planted can come forth look at the great latter rain supposed to be done how the world how they would run over the wall leap over things and how they'd be this great this is the prophet not describing describing the attributes that are in you because remember whatever attributes are in the seed is in you if you are the fruit amen this people will be an invincible Army amen amen he says the kind of trop you get is the kind of seed you put in the field the latter rain is fixing to fall you've held the seed there long enough oh you see you've held the seed there long enough for all these years in the message the prophet is saying you've held there long enough unbelieving you've believed the word and you're looking for a coming son and he's coming amen that's the real church today so what's the real church today those amen that can produce the coming son amen if you're not producing the sun then you are not the real church amen because only the word of God can produce the sun because Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word amen the word formed within Mary amen produced the son and the Word was made flesh yes amen so if the word is within you it must produce the sun amen amen the prophetes and what they trying to do they're trying to manufacture the latter rain remember I told you they didn't they couldn't wait for it all along the Dynamics so they started to manufacture the latter rain and the prophet says it's just nonsense why the latter rain will sweep the world being a former rain sewing the words that's right now you'll see what the latter rain produced say you see just like Eve Eve could not wait any longer for Adam the prophet says I'm taking this now from spoken what is the Original Seed he says that Eve instead of waiting for Adam aen to speak the word and produce the son in her could not wait any longer and so she gave herself up to the serpent Sarah could not wait for the promise to come to Pastor she said take HEI the thy servant you see the church world could not wait amen so they begin to manufacture things amen amen but this bride the true elect of God like Mary amen waited amen remember Mary was a virgin what does that mean it means she was waiting for marriage it means she was waiting for the right time and season amen Mary was not impatient Mary did not try to manufacture anything amen so like that this bride amen now has been impregnated with the word of God amen amen and now she's going to produce the results you see why is protecting the word of God so important it was the word of God in Mary that was made flesh that produced the results this is why Amen in the message we've protected the word all of these years it's because that same word of God in you that is going to produce the results amen it's not a different word word it's not some just some Supernatural thing that's going to come down it's the same word that you've been watching all along is going to produce the results amen hallelujah amen the word of God living in US am amen this is why the word of God is so important amen not a Creed not a Dogma like the church World took but amen like Mary we take on the word of God yes now the prophet goes on to say that because the denominations planted they seed what crop did they reap reap they reaped a crop the prophet say of Ricky and Ras aen of Jezebel of painted faces they reaped a crop of wishy-washy Christians and of backsliding preachers and man preachers without a backbone that's the kind of trop they reached such a fallen condition that the prophet said give it 20 more years and the Pent the Pentecost will be far more worse than what the Catholic church is that's the crop that they have they are producing because that's the seed that was planted so the prophet says if that seed that was planted produced its crop how much more the word of God which was planted in seed form how much more is that going to produce the fruits in this hour what kind of a church amen if that produced a fallen Church what kind of a church is the word of God going to produce in this hour amen what kind of a people amen amen a people amen that can produce the very results of the word amen a people that can produce amen the Son of God manifested in flesh again amen a people that can produce the word amen the image Son of God Amen before the people yes why because the word amen imagine how much more potentials lay in that seed word amen if if a seed of discrepancy that was solded had so much of potential that it could make up the Pentecostal Church far more worse than the Catholic Church how much more potential Lays in the true seat of God yes amen amen how much more potential amen lays in you and I am think about it the church well has become this great thing this great organization they've taken over the world the church world Amen they've accumulated so much of wealth all of these churches all of these great preachers highly respected and all of these things they made a great name for themselves and if they as the seed of discrepancy are doing that then surely the the bride of Christ which has the seed word of God is going to produce the Greater Works amen amen the bride of Christ is going to produce all that God has promised throughout the word and that is why amen we title this message that we are the final Vindication of William Brandon's message because if the bride does not produce what this message has says said it will produce then William Brandon's message is not true but when the briad produces it it's a final vindication and then she becomes the final voice to the final age you see it's not just preaching out there and telling the people God sent a prophet that's not being the final voice to the final age you got to produce the result that was in the seed and when you show the fruits and they can see the fruits then now you have the final voice to the final age that is why when Moses and Aaron begin to show to the Egyptians the signs that was performed they became the final voice to Egypt amen so the bride of Christ is here now in this hour producing the final Works producing the supernatural producing the attributes of God and that is why they are the final voice in the hour amen amen the the parable of when Jesus said to his disciples gave them a parable or speaking to the Pharisees he said you know there was this landlord that planted a vard and as it became prosperous he started to hire workers to work the vineyard and he went away and over the years when it became time to give the fruit of the vineyard these workers now didn't want to produce the fruit and they started to kill all the Servants of God that he sent eventually Here Comes the Sun now and they kill the sun they say this is the air we'll kill the Sun and so what does the owner the landlord of the vard do he says he will come and he will slay them and he will give the vineard to another who can produce the fruits that's what the Bible says amen so God in in in the in the dispensation and change from the Old Testament to the New Testament took the vineyard from the Jews who could not produce the fruits and gave it to the Gentiles and now in the end time where the church world could not produce the fruits God has taken it away from them and he says I will give it to a people who can produce the fruits a people who has my potentials amen a people who is just like me and can speak like me they will produce the fruits in the hour amen so you see we amen are in partnership with God we are in partnership with the angel we are in partnership with the prophet because the bride under her messenger amen is going to produce the final Works amen amen so amen just to wrap things up and to sum up everything that we have been saying here amen Moses and Aaron and the angel of the Lord worked together and became the final voice to Egypt just like that in this hour now the bride under her messenger is the final voice to this age and she's producing the potentials she's producing the attributes of God she is producing everything that was laying within the seed why because it's Harvest Time amen amen the fruits are on display amen and you can't hide when the fruits are on display amen hallelujah amen just like how the denominational World they can't hide what they are and they are not trying to hide what they are they are very open about it they are no longer shy of of it you'll find them very openly accepting gays and lesbians in the church all over YouTube and all of these things they're not shy about it anymore they know who they are they know that they are reprobate amen they know that they cannot produce the word of God in this hour but just like that oh just like how the church world is no longer shy about it heyen the bride of Christ is no longer shy about who she is amen the bride of Christ amen has now stepped forth amen she begin to come become bold amen she begin to now grab the book from the hand of the mighty Angel yes amen she begin to eat the book and now she can identify and say I am the final voice to the final age I am coming to adoption I am becoming a spiritual mature son and daughter of God Amen we are no longer shy about it hey man we are now openly proclaiming that we under our messenger William yes amen who was the true Vindicated prophet in this hour amen who was the final prophet of the age we under the message of William brandom are the final voice to the final age amen if you're looking for someone to produce the seed word of God in this hour it's us amen it's the bride of Christ amen no one else is going to produce the word of God in this hour but the bride of Christ amen amen do you believe that you are one of them amen you believe you are the bride of Christ that has the potentials of Christ amen amen how can you not have the potentials when the seed word is within you amen and all through the years that seed word has been laying in the presence of the sunlight amen it's been ripening and ripening in the presence of the sunlight but now amen it's producing the crop amen it's producing the Harvest amen hallelujah and remember when you are producing the fruits it's for others to enjoy amen hallelujah it's for others to see the fruits on display amen hallelujah I pray you've been blessed tonight amen I don't want to go much further than that I know many people are unwell and stuff amen but just to encourage you amen it's not just the prophet it was not just Moses amen hidden in there there was Aaron amen who types the priesthood who types The fivefold Who types the children of God Amen Hallelujah the children of God in this hour are producing the fruits of the hour amen hallelujah let's stand at this time [Music] amen have us time amen all the potentials that laid in the seed word is now coming Amen to fruition oh hallelujah amen amen all seeds now are coming to fruition the seeds of discrepancy are coming to fruition amen the seed word of God is coming to fruition amen the Antichrist is coming to his amen glorification the church Church world is coming to their glorification and the bride now is coming to her glorification amen how is she
