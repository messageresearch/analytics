[0:00] Amen. Much better attendance. See, I'm
[0:02] taking note and I'm complimenting the
[0:04] people that have not come last week or
[0:07] the other weeks. But even brother Kenzo,
[0:09] his birthday today. Come on, let's give
[0:10] him a hand. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well,
[0:14] bless you, brother Kenzo. Amen. How old
[0:16] are you today, brother?
[0:18] &gt;&gt; 56.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; 56. That's the age the prophet was when
[0:21] he left this life. 56. Amen. Quite a
[0:25] young man, but the prophet always
[0:27] thought he was old. Remember 1960 when
[0:29] he's sitting there on the bed
[0:32] &gt;&gt; and he thinks he's very old.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Kenzo, the Lord bless you.
[0:36] The Lord keep you. Amen. Lots of
[0:38] birthdays this week. Brother Kenny's
[0:39] birthday was yesterday.
[0:42] Kenzo's birthday too. And somebody's
[0:44] birthday is tomorrow.
[0:47] Joseph and somebody else. Amen. Praise
[0:50] the Lord. We all know. Amen. So we pray
[0:53] that the Lord will be with you. Bless
[0:55] you. Amen. And let's turn to the Bible
[0:56] as we read our scripture.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn to second Peter. We were
[1:11] reading that on Sunday.
[1:22] Amen.
[1:25] Brother Josh, can you read that for me?
[1:26] Amen. According to where he's talking
[1:28] about his divine nature and his power,
[1:30] just that one verse there.
[1:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:39] Second Peter chapter 1. Amen.
[1:48] Yes, that's it.
[1:50] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[1:52] Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
[1:54] his abundant mercy, had begotten us
[1:57] again unto a lively hope by the
[2:01] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[2:03] dead to inheritance incorruptible and
[2:06] undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
[2:10] reserved in heaven for you, who are kept
[2:12] by the power of God through faith, and
[2:15] to salvation, ready to be revealed in
[2:17] the last time, wherein ye greatly
[2:21] rejoice, though now for a season, if
[2:24] need be, yay, I in heaviness through
[2:28] manifold temptations, that the trial of
[2:31] your fate, being much more precious than
[2:34] of gold that perisheth, though it be
[2:37] tried with fire, might be found unto
[2:40] praise and honor and glory at the
[2:42] appearing of Jesus Christ, whom having
[2:46] not seen, ye love, in whom Now ye see
[2:49] him not, yet believing ye rejoice with
[2:53] joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[2:57] Receiving the end of your faith, even
[3:00] the salvation of your souls. of ut
[3:03] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[3:06] search diligently
[3:08] who prophesied of the grace that should
[3:11] come unto you searching what or what
[3:15] manner of time the spirit of Christ
[3:17] which was in them did signify when he
[3:21] testified beforehand the sufferings of
[3:24] Christ and the glory that should follow.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You may be seated. God bless
[3:30] you.
[3:34] See if I can get my notes here. Amen.
[3:35] So, we continuing from Sunday. Amen. God
[3:37] bless you with the Luke, Sister Pastel.
[3:39] Amen. Pray you be blessed in the house
[3:40] of the Lord. Amen. So, we were looking
[3:42] at there's no signal, dear brothers.
[3:44] Amen.
[3:48] Remember, we're looking at divine power.
[3:51] How many of you know we were following
[3:52] crowning our ministry as adopted sons?
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember when Jesus went on
[3:57] high, he said, you shall receive power
[3:59] after the Holy Ghost is come upon you.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; And Jesus was not lying.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; The question they asked Jesus, when
[4:08] shall you restore the kingdom?
[4:10] &gt;&gt; They wanted a king like David. They
[4:12] wanted a king like Solomon.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; They thought Jesus had come to establish
[4:15] an earthly kingdom.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; But then Jesus switches their mind and
[4:19] say, "Hey, I haven't come here to set up
[4:20] an earthly kingdom. You shall receive
[4:22] power because you were made to be kings
[4:24] and priests on the earth.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; I'm equipping you as the king of the
[4:28] earth.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he's sending back the power,
[4:32] the original spirit that Adam had that
[4:35] was lost in the garden of Eden. He now
[4:37] restores it back to Adam again, which is
[4:39] now the disciples.
[4:42] So, one aspect of divine power is what
[4:45] we are looking at is creative power.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get distracted by the
[4:50] screen. That's just to keep you awake.
[4:54] Amen. Praise the Lord. Creative power.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; It's an aspect of divine power.
[4:59] &gt;&gt; Now, we know there are many kinds of
[5:00] power. Love is a power.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; We were speaking about a character
[5:04] development and how your character now
[5:06] becomes a seed from which you rule.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Because love is a character trait.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Joy is a character trait.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Meekness, patience, temperance is a
[5:16] character trait. And we start to rule
[5:18] from the seat of power.
[5:20] And because we have the character of
[5:23] Christ now that becomes foot to rule.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord. Amen.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Because character with power is foot to
[5:29] rule.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, we're moving into
[5:32] a time and season now.
[5:35] Amen. Where God has got to get his sons
[5:38] and daughters positionally placed so
[5:41] that he can operate through her. God has
[5:44] not taken us through seven church ages
[5:46] and built us all the way from faith to
[5:48] Amen. the capstone of love for him not
[5:51] to use us completely.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; When I say use us completely, he wants
[5:55] to tabernacle our bodies.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before I forget, I want to welcome
[6:00] sister Alicia. Amen. In the back,
[6:01] brother Shan's daughter. Amen. Let's
[6:03] welcome her. Amen. God bless you,
[6:05] sister. Good to see you there in the
[6:07] house of the Lord. Amen. We've been
[6:10] praying for you if you didn't know.
[6:12] Amen. So we'll continue to keep praying
[6:14] for you. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; So the prophet of God says here now,
[6:19] Amen. So we've come through seven church
[6:20] ages, right? He says, "This age started
[6:22] just at the turn of the 20th century."
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; As it was to be the age in which the
[6:29] true church would return to being the
[6:31] bride she was at Pentecost.
[6:36] Amen. So I don't know. This one keeps
[6:38] doing its own thing. Praise the Lord.
[6:40] But pay attention to this. He's saying,
[6:42] "We know that there must be of necessity
[6:45] a return of dynamic power."
[6:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; There must be a return of dynamic power.
[6:53] Now, why send the power?
[6:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Remember, we are in the Omega age.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Now, to know why send the power back in
[7:02] the Omega age, you got to know it was
[7:04] there in the alpha age.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:08] When God said let us make man in our own
[7:10] image.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible says then God created man in
[7:14] his own image.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Right? That was Adam had all the
[7:19] attributes of God. He had all the nature
[7:21] of God.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; He had all the qualities, the
[7:23] characteristics of God.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; But the likeness part is which he was
[7:28] going to grow up in.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; He was going to grow from faith all the
[7:32] way to the capstone of love. Amen.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; So, Adam possessed within him the power
[7:37] to speak to animals.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; The power to name animals. He had the
[7:41] mind of Christ and he knew what to do
[7:43] with the word.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; So remember now, don't lose this
[7:50] thought.
[7:52] In what state did God create Adam and
[7:55] Eve? In what part of the condescension?
[7:58] It wasn't in spirit form.
[8:01] Brother Brandham says it was in the
[8:03] state where he had condescended from
[8:05] spirit to word.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; It was in the form of Melzdc who is the
[8:11] fullness of the word.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he says out of this rich
[8:16] spirit came forth the logos. The logos
[8:18] is the word.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; You can get no higher state of the word
[8:21] or no more mature state of the word than
[8:23] mazdc.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Mazdc is the full state of the word.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:30] Lord.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Adam was growing up to be like
[8:35] Melazedc.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; To possess creative power.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; When God told Adam multiply and
[8:42] replenish the earth, he was expecting
[8:44] Adam to grow up.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; Now, I know a lot of you are thinking,
[8:50] "Oh, how can Adam grow? How come Adam
[8:52] grow?" But the Bible says Jesus grew in
[8:54] wisdom and in stature.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. We can believe that Jesus
[8:58] grew in wisdom and in stature, but we
[9:00] don't want to believe that Adam grew in
[9:01] wisdom and in stature.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; But this is where the problem came. Eve
[9:09] could not wait. The prophet would tell
[9:12] us.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. I think it's in the next
[9:15] one. You probably see it there when it
[9:17] flashes you away.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Adam's bride could not wait.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; God had told Adam and Eve, "Multiply and
[9:24] replenish the earth." It was an oncoming
[9:27] promise.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; So for Adam to produce his part of the
[9:31] word to multiply his own God's species.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; I say it again. There was one species
[9:36] that has not been reproduced since
[9:38] Genesis.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; And it's only in this time.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; It's not in the time of Ephesus. It's
[9:45] not in the time of Smyrna. It's not in
[9:47] the time of any other age. It's only in
[9:50] this time that God has got a bride that
[9:52] he can marry and reproduce the life of
[9:55] Christ.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; So, it's only now that God's specy can
[10:00] be reproduced. And that's why Romans 8
[10:02] says all creation is waiting for Jesus
[10:05] Christ to reproduce himself so that sons
[10:08] and daughters of God can be back on the
[10:10] earth.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; So, Adam's bride could not wait, but she
[10:17] mingled the seed illegally.
[10:19] The prophet says she illegally mingled
[10:21] the seed.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; He says we were supposed to believe
[10:24] God's word and alone, but Adam's bride
[10:26] could not wait.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; She went forth first.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; And and he says that's the way the
[10:31] church does. We always want to
[10:32] manufacture something.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; You find people with no gifts want to
[10:36] manufacture gifts.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; People with no gift of prophecy want to
[10:39] manufacture gifts of prophecy.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; People with no gift of healing want to
[10:43] manufacture gifts of healing.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We always get in trouble when we
[10:46] move ahead of God's word. That's right.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Janice and Jamus look
[10:52] powerful.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Their sticks also turned to serpents,
[10:56] &gt;&gt; but it was not of God.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; So, don't go chasing signs.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus warned us.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Don't be a generation
[11:07] that seeks after signs."
[11:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Got to work it up on the platform.
[11:13] He says, "Amen. She's got to have
[11:15] everything. Manufacture something."
[11:17] Amen. He says it's a phony. This would
[11:19] be Amen. He says if it wasn't a phony,
[11:22] he says the world would be a flame with
[11:24] the power of God.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; The church would be on fire.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; The dead would be raised and all kinds
[11:31] of things would be taking place.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; Now I ask you, if we are the true church
[11:39] of God,
[11:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; We are the wife of the Lord Jesus
[11:43] Christ,
[11:44] &gt;&gt; the dynamic power must be in us.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say it as well that
[11:50] the dynamic power is in the bride.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; But she needs the character to operate
[11:56] the power.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; And she needs the faith to operate the
[11:59] power.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; And that's where now let's be honest
[12:04] with ourselves. How are we advancing the
[12:07] kingdom of God when 24/7 our minds are
[12:10] on the things of the earth?
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; We were called not to be, Amen. ordinary
[12:15] people on the earth. We were called to
[12:16] be disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; But let's be honest. So the way the
[12:21] pressure of life is, we are so caught up
[12:23] in trying to uh get money to buy food or
[12:26] to provide a a shelter over our heads
[12:28] and clothing for our body that we do not
[12:31] possess the time.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; To advance the kingdom of God.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; But somebody needs to do it.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who will say here am I Lord send
[12:47] me
[12:49] &gt;&gt; now? Now, now watch how God works. God
[12:51] always multiplies what we give him.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Luke 6:38, "Give it
[12:58] shall come back to you.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Good measure, pressed down, shaken
[13:02] together, and running over."
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Now, we can't be saying, "Lord, Lord, if
[13:07] you only give me the time, Lord, I would
[13:09] go and and and and win the nations
[13:11] through you.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; I would prophesy to nations. But you got
[13:14] 10 minutes and you're prophesying to
[13:16] nobody.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, if you only give me Lord money,
[13:20] I'll go across the seas for you. But you
[13:23] can't go across the street for him.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Remember stewardship. What we give to
[13:30] him, he will take it and he will
[13:32] multiply it.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; So if we can say, Lord, honestly, all I
[13:37] have right now is an hour.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Then give him the hour.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:44] Give him the hour and watch what God
[13:46] will do with that.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you're struggling in
[13:50] your prayer life and you say, "I can't
[13:52] stay on my knees for an hour."
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Well, why why don't you give him what
[13:57] you can
[13:59] &gt;&gt; If you can only manage 15 minutes now,
[14:03] give him 15 minutes.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; But pray with all sincerity.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I ask you again. Amen. Let's
[14:10] reestablish our prayer life with the
[14:12] Lord.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; Let's reestablish our Bible reading with
[14:15] the Lord.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Let's reestablish reading the message
[14:18] book because we say we believe a prophet
[14:20] yet we don't read it.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; We say we believe on the Lord Jesus
[14:23] Christ but we don't read his word.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; We say we we believe in the Lord and our
[14:27] connection with the unsealed realm is
[14:28] prayer but we are so disconnected.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; If we ever get disconnected from
[14:32] internet all hell would break loose.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; We create our own hell.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we ever get connected where?
[14:40] Amen. We out of signal. You You almost
[14:42] like panic.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; I'm cut off.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; But soon as you get internet, it's
[14:51] mindless conversation.
[14:54] The first thing you do explain to 10
[14:55] people, oh, I didn't have internet
[14:57] connection. Sorry, I didn't answer your
[14:58] call.
[15:00] We are so concerned being connected with
[15:04] earthly things. But when it comes, we
[15:07] lost our heavenly connection. I haven't
[15:09] prayed in a week.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; I haven't prayed in a month.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; But God wants you. He's waiting for you
[15:23] to connect with him.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says if the true power was
[15:28] in the church
[15:30] &gt;&gt; and not manufactured,
[15:32] he says the dead will be raised. Yes.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says the church would be on
[15:38] fire for God.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; When we come to church, we should be so
[15:41] prayed up.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be waiting to come to
[15:44] church to now work ourselves up in
[15:46] prayer.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; We should come knowing, being conscious,
[15:48] I'm going to meet with the King of
[15:50] Kings. I'm going to meet with the Lord
[15:51] of Lords.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those of you that are singing,
[15:54] ought to come prepared. Amen. A fire in
[15:56] your song. Amen. To come and minister to
[15:58] the people of God.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Everything is a gift
[16:04] unto the Lord. The musician should be
[16:06] Amen. prayed up.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The musicians even before
[16:10] the service should not be having
[16:12] mindless conversation, idol
[16:13] conversations.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Watch musicians. They
[16:18] are like disappearing uh CIA agents.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; You'll see it more in the big meetings.
[16:25] Yes, small meetings. They'll get caught.
[16:26] They'll know if you they're not in the
[16:28] service. But you watch the big meetings
[16:29] in the conventions in the combines. You
[16:32] know when the the musicians are going
[16:34] see where they are gone. They're not
[16:36] sitting in the service.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; They're roaming around outside.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; They're so thirsty. They went to the
[16:41] tuck shop to buy drinks and everything.
[16:43] And they spend the entire service
[16:45] criticizing how the sound was and how
[16:48] this was wrong and how that was wrong.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Musicians, am I right?
[16:53] &gt;&gt; Hey, come. Do we have honest musicians
[16:55] here? Come. Can the musicians say amen?
[16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; But that's what happened
[17:02] &gt;&gt; now. They were so upset with everything.
[17:04] But they now when the pastor says come
[17:06] after the service and play, they go back
[17:07] and they play now with all kind of dead
[17:09] spirits.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; They didn't hear a single word the
[17:12] pastor preached. All they had was
[17:13] Tropica.
[17:17] Praise the Lord.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Satan can impersonate any kind
[17:26] of gift that God has got.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Hey, are you listening?
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Prophecy.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Satan can impersonate it.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; But he cannot bring that word.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; So, what some of those people like to
[17:41] prophesy? They got no word.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; They got no depth of the word.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; Word to transform the people and what to
[17:50] equip the people. Amen.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; When they prophesy, all they want you to
[17:54] do is look on me.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Look at how powerful I am.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Look at how powerful I am.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; But he says they can't bring the word.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; Now, this I'm just reading this to back
[18:07] up what I was saying that Adam was going
[18:09] to grow up into the mature state of the
[18:11] word, which was to be like Melzdc
[18:13] because M Adam possessed the power to
[18:16] speak to winds.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; Power to speak to waves. So which means
[18:19] he control the elements.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; But when it came to creative power
[18:25] &gt;&gt; to speak like Melzdc,
[18:27] &gt;&gt; that's the image he was growing up into.
[18:29] And that's the thing that Eve could not
[18:30] wait.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; So here what see what the prophet calls
[18:34] him. He calls him a spoken seed word of
[18:38] God.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; So you know the seed is not mature.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Adam was a spoken seed word.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Seed needs to be planted. Amen.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Seed needs to now add to your faith
[18:51] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[18:52] godliness, brotherly kindness. So, Adam
[18:54] was going to grow up. How many of you
[18:56] can see that he was a seed
[18:58] &gt;&gt; word of God?
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; And he was going to come into the
[19:02] likeness of Melzdc. If you don't believe
[19:04] me, go and read Genesis 1:27. When it
[19:07] says, "And God created them in his own
[19:10] image." He leaves out the word likeness.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. Because that was the
[19:13] path that Adam was going to grow up into
[19:16] &gt;&gt; the likeness of God which is now in the
[19:18] end time. Peter describes it from faith
[19:20] all the way to love.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he was given a bride to
[19:25] reproduce himself. That's why the bride
[19:27] was given to him to reproduce himself to
[19:30] produce another son of God.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; But Satan came in through the serpent
[19:35] and said, "I'm going to offer you
[19:36] another way.
[19:39] You can either wait for Adam to come to
[19:40] the mature state of the word
[19:43] and speak
[19:47] if you shall have a son and his name
[19:48] shall be called s and Eve was supposed
[19:51] to say be unto me according to thy word.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; What Adam and Eve failed to do the holy
[19:57] the Gabriel spoke to Mary and confirmed
[20:00] that by creative power Mary could
[20:03] conceive.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Right.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:08] Okay.
[20:09] So, we find here that the serpent told
[20:12] Eve, we can produce another way. There's
[20:15] another way. You can either wait to
[20:17] produce God's provided way or there's an
[20:20] alternative way you can reproduce the
[20:22] animal way
[20:24] &gt;&gt; because remember God had put them in an
[20:25] animal body.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; So, he was not prepared to wait for the
[20:30] son of God to come to maturity and speak
[20:34] &gt;&gt; creative power.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:37] So she chose the animal way.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; She left the guide. Adam was her guide.
[20:41] Adam was her teacher. Adam was her
[20:43] spirit of truth. But she left the guy.
[20:46] She left the teacher. She left the
[20:47] spirit of truth.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; She fell. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're in the message. I I wish
[20:58] really wish you could have seen these
[21:00] things. Uh,
[21:02] brother Caleb, I think we really need to
[21:04] buy another thing because this unit is
[21:06] it's malfunctioning
[21:08] and anything that's not in his image and
[21:10] likeness is malfunctioning.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; So, if this thing is malfunctioning,
[21:14] let's change it. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[21:16] It's not very nice to be trying to show
[21:18] people quotes and they can't see it. So,
[21:20] in the message marriage and divorce, the
[21:23] prophet is now confirming that the bride
[21:24] was supposed to come from the word by
[21:26] spiritual multiplication.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. showing that Adam because remember
[21:31] God created what first a spirit man.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; So the type of man that Adam was
[21:35] supposed to reproduce was a spirit man.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Everyone understand
[21:40] that point.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; He says we don't need new membership. We
[21:43] need a revival of divine power.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; And joy in human hearts that transforms
[21:47] them away from the things of the world
[21:49] and makes them new creatures. So the
[21:52] power of the Holy Ghost that he's put
[21:53] into our hearts makes us new creatures.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Old things have passed away.
[21:58] If you're old, all things have become
[21:59] new.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a revival of divine power.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; But you know, sometimes there's power
[22:06] that can remain dormant.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet calls it untapped resources.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Why? The cares of life come to choke it.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; The cares of life. Oh, I can't express
[22:16] divine power because I've got to pay t.
[22:19] I've got to pay interwini municipality
[22:21] bill. I've got to pay for my water and
[22:24] lights.
[22:28] suppressing what is laying within you.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; You were called to be a son and daughter
[22:33] of God.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; God is more interested in your spiritual
[22:39] well-being than your natural being.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; So, Amen. He says it transforms us.
[22:49] Amen. Away from these things. And he
[22:51] says, "We expecting to see God pour out
[22:54] his divine power."
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; We expecting to see God pour out his
[22:59] divine power.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Now, how many of you know that if you're
[23:02] not expecting something, you won't even
[23:03] look for it. You won't even appreciate
[23:05] it when it comes.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[23:10] For example, if there was a crippled
[23:12] person sitting here and you never had an
[23:14] expectation in your house to see the
[23:15] supernatural or the miraculous,
[23:20] &gt;&gt; we prayed for that crippled person and
[23:21] they got healed.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; You know, you'd be enthused for a
[23:25] moment.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; You'll walk out of here unfazed. You
[23:28] might even forget about it in the
[23:30] morning because you were not expecting
[23:32] it.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; We sing that song, I've come expecting
[23:36] Jesus.
[23:38] But we don't really realize that what we
[23:40] are saying is we're coming to meet with
[23:42] him personally.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; How many of us ever track our spiritual
[23:49] growth?
[23:50] &gt;&gt; Track our spiritual life. It every one
[23:53] of us young people even
[23:55] have a desire to grow spiritually in the
[23:57] things of God.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Have a desire to grow up in the things
[24:00] of God.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. How long will we be? Amen. Just
[24:04] babes in Christ.
[24:07] We want God to rock us to sleep every
[24:09] night.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; When are we going to be sons and
[24:11] daughters of God?
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Who God can be proud. Amen. And say,
[24:15] "That's my son.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; That's my daughter."
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can have confidence in them.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, why did he give us divine
[24:24] power?" The prophet of God is telling us
[24:26] that he gave us divine power to break
[24:28] the power of Satan over this life.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We've got to be able to
[24:34] break the stronghold of Satan.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; And many times we are running to
[24:39] everybody else, but the power is laying
[24:41] within us.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; How many of you know that sometimes you
[24:48] lose your keys? And you're going and
[24:50] you're running to your wife, I lost my
[24:51] keys. Where's my keys? You're going to
[24:52] your children, where's my keys? But the
[24:55] key is in your pocket.
[25:02] Then now they tell you sit down, replace
[25:03] your steps, check everywhere. Then now
[25:06] when you feel the key in your pocket,
[25:07] you feel very
[25:12] stupid.
[25:15] You might, you know what I mean?
[25:18] &gt;&gt; So what am I saying? The power is within
[25:21] you.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; We need to shake off the shackles.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; We need to shake ourselves from
[25:26] unbelief.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith needs to stir up the divine
[25:30] power of God.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. and realize that the power is
[25:33] laying within me
[25:34] &gt;&gt; as much as yes maybe my faith levels are
[25:37] low now because there is levels of faith
[25:40] &gt;&gt; right
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke to the woman oh we have
[25:42] little faith so people can have little
[25:44] faith
[25:45] &gt;&gt; and then he says I've never seen such
[25:47] great faith so faith is measurable
[25:52] &gt;&gt; so yes maybe sometimes I need to go to
[25:54] brother Jeff and and just get a boost
[25:57] &gt;&gt; like when my car battery goes low
[26:00] &gt;&gt; I need to borrow jumper cables,
[26:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[26:02] &gt;&gt; I need to now connect it to his battery.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; And I need to start swinging my car.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; So if you're ever feeling down, don't
[26:10] ever feel down and out.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; Get a power boost.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Don't you know the
[26:17] scripture says one of us can put a
[26:18] thousand to flight and two of us can
[26:20] send a legion fleeing.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We get supercharged when we come
[26:25] to fellowship.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; We get supercharged. Amen. When we talk
[26:28] to one another and our faith levels are
[26:30] being built up,
[26:31] &gt;&gt; we realize, amen, who we are. We're a
[26:33] son and daughter of God. Amen. I'm not
[26:35] just called, Amen, as an ordinary person
[26:37] on the earth, but I've been called to
[26:39] the highest position on the earth. Right
[26:41] now, I am the most important person on
[26:43] the earth. Amen. I am more important
[26:45] than President Trump. I am more
[26:47] important than Amen. the Pope Leo.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[26:52] The major player on the earth right now
[26:53] that God is working with is the wife of
[26:56] the Lord Jesus Christ. Can somebody
[26:58] agree with that?
[26:59] &gt;&gt; People are more excited about Putin.
[27:01] People are excited about the Pope.
[27:03] People are excited about Russia. People
[27:05] are excited about uh this guy Trump.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; But they don't realize the most
[27:10] important player right now.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that is in the three-fold
[27:13] mystery purpose of God that was locked
[27:15] up in the back part of God's mind that
[27:17] he's been working to achieve through all
[27:19] the ages is you and I
[27:21] &gt;&gt; pull us out of our condition.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to realize who we are.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; And there's only one thing the prophet
[27:33] says now in that day you know I am in
[27:35] the father, father in me, I in you, you
[27:37] in me. You all know that scripture.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; What day is that?
[27:42] What what is this intermingling?
[27:44] &gt;&gt; This I'm in the father,
[27:47] &gt;&gt; the father in me, I in you, you in me.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; What is this intermingling?
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Sounds to me like marriage.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Ah, come on.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; So the marriage is only in the
[28:02] headstone.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; What is the scripture?
[28:09] Everybody understands the scripture.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; I'm in the father, the father in me. I
[28:14] in you, you in me.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; It's the oneness of the godhead.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; It's the oneness of the godhead.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe Jesus is part of
[28:25] the godhead?
[28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe you're the wife
[28:30] of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[28:32] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe the two is one?
[28:36] &gt;&gt; So then where are you really?
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[28:39] If you're in the headstone, you must be
[28:41] part of the Godhead.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; The three-fold mystery purpose which was
[28:44] locked up in the back part of God's
[28:45] mind. You even came out from the at the
[28:47] cross when they pierced his side and the
[28:49] church was birthed.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; He released you at the cross.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now in this end time, so he
[29:00] released you just before Pentecost,
[29:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[29:04] &gt;&gt; He released you just before Pentecost.
[29:06] And on the day of Pentecost, he sent the
[29:09] spirit back to the earth.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; To connect with the body.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; But now in the end time, he doesn't just
[29:16] leave you there. He comes back as the
[29:18] male person.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the headstone coming.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; He's coming now to unite with the body.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch. He says that that day,
[29:34] he's trying to define what he means by
[29:36] that. That day he says because the same
[29:38] power of God was in Jehovah God rested
[29:41] in Jesus Christ. The same power that
[29:43] rested in Jesus Christ rest in the
[29:45] placed sons in the body of Christ.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to chew that and digest it
[29:54] quickly.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it slowly again. The
[29:58] power that was in Jehovah, the power to
[30:00] speak,
[30:01] &gt;&gt; the power to create.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says rested in Jesus Christ.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Then he says the same power that rested
[30:11] in Jesus Christ rest in placed sons
[30:16] &gt;&gt; in the body of Christ.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm digesting
[30:22] it. I'm getting it slowly. You mean in
[30:24] Genesis 1 when God said, "Let there be
[30:26] and there was that power is in me."
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. But you see, it takes
[30:32] faith to believe that
[30:34] &gt;&gt; or you can't move it.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Do you know it takes faith to believe
[30:37] that the power is in me right now?
[30:40] &gt;&gt; I can go up to my circumstance,
[30:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[30:44] &gt;&gt; And you know, you got to know how to
[30:46] pray.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; You go to that circumstance. You go to
[30:50] that situation. You go to that demon
[30:52] &gt;&gt; and you say, "All that was in the
[30:53] father,
[30:54] &gt;&gt; that was poured into Jesus
[30:56] &gt;&gt; is now poured into me."
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Demon shouldn't be able to ask you at
[31:00] this time. And Paul we know
[31:02] &gt;&gt; and this we know who are you?
[31:04] &gt;&gt; He's supposed to know who you are.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; You know why demons don't even ask that
[31:09] question? We don't even challenge them.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; We we are very scientific and and
[31:16] professional in this age.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; We know the scriptures too well.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:21] So now when there's a demon possessed
[31:22] person there, we say, you know what, I'd
[31:25] rather leave him with the one demon
[31:29] because you know Jesus what he said if I
[31:31] cast that one demon out,
[31:34] I know this fell doesn't want to receive
[31:36] the Holy Ghost.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; So now I'm going to cast that demon out.
[31:39] They go wandering in dry places
[31:42] and seven worst demons come upon him.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; So I'd rather handle this one demon.
[31:51] Amen.
[31:53] Very scholarly people.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; So we sit in the church with demons.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; We sit in the church where the word
[32:04] doesn't have the power to convict you.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; You know like that woman the prophet was
[32:09] giving examples. He says I she was
[32:11] saying I could see my mother's soul fry
[32:13] in hell and it wouldn't even move me.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; We got people sitting in the church
[32:16] still. Ah, preacher. No matter how hard
[32:18] you preach, no matter what you say, I
[32:21] shall not be. I shall not be.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; That's their favorite song.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Nothing moves them.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; They can see uh signs. They can see the
[32:36] prophet prophesy that the pope will come
[32:38] from the USA.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Nothing moves them.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; They can see Israel at war. USA engaging
[32:45] in war. Nothing moves them.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; They can see Russia. Now people don't
[32:52] know why the war in Russia.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; If you go and read and you read there,
[32:56] why war in Russia? The war in Russia
[32:58] because the largest population of Jews
[33:01] &gt;&gt; was there in that European countries.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[33:07] The word is called aliyah. You go and
[33:09] Google it, you'll see. Since the war in
[33:11] Russia,
[33:12] &gt;&gt; they have had the largest amount of Jews
[33:14] go back to the homeland. That's right.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; They were displaced.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; And if you're wondering why Russia can't
[33:21] make inroads into Ukraine,
[33:24] you got to read Revelation chapter 7.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; He's got four angels holding back the
[33:28] wings.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Hold back the winds.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; So even Putin is frustrated because he
[33:35] know he's got the military power.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Putin has the military power.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Putin is a superpower. Putin Amen. The
[33:43] the prophet prophesies that Russia will
[33:45] be the one that blows up the Vatican,
[33:47] &gt;&gt; will be the one that blows up the USA.
[33:49] So they have the potential,
[33:51] &gt;&gt; but they can't make any headwinds
[33:53] because
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Besides the four angels that are holding
[33:58] back the winds in Revelation chapter 10,
[34:01] there's an angel, mighty angel coming
[34:03] down.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; And putting his feet on the lamp and his
[34:06] foot on the sea. One foot on the sea,
[34:08] one foot on the land. You got to go to
[34:10] Revelation chapter 13 to see the two
[34:12] piece. One coming out of the land, one
[34:14] coming out of the sea. These powers are
[34:16] being suppressed by the mighty angel.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; So even though they are moving into gear
[34:22] and into position and into place, they
[34:24] cannot move because angels are
[34:26] suppressing them.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wonderful.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; And why? For the protection of the
[34:33] bride.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Because if he allows them to go into the
[34:37] bride is not in position yet.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, get in position.
[34:44] Amen. Now, how much more must we show
[34:46] you sign after signal,
[34:48] &gt;&gt; sign after sign that we are in the end
[34:50] time
[34:51] &gt;&gt; and we showing you the greatest sign
[34:53] right now is to see that you are coming
[34:55] into position.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; That suddenly now you are not interested
[35:00] in the things of God. Suddenly your
[35:02] heart is being turned to the things of
[35:04] God.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Those are signs. Praise the Lord.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Now watch. He says, "Let me say this. If
[35:10] you count me a fanatic from this night
[35:12] on, the very same thing that I'm
[35:14] speaking of will be done. What thing
[35:15] will be done, Brother Brandham? There'll
[35:17] be a power put into the church.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Watch the way he says it now. He says
[35:24] there'll be a power put into the church.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; And now he's coming in. The Holy Spirit
[35:30] will so anoint the people, they'll speak
[35:32] the word.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; And it will create itself right there.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for it to flash so you see
[35:44] it.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; They'll speak a word and it'll create
[35:47] itself right there.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; So, which means that part which Adam
[35:51] didn't go up to,
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; you are now getting up to it.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; I say again, we are not in the legacy
[35:58] age.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; People want to be in the legacy and age
[36:06] under Leosian spirit.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; We are in the age of adoption. Adoption
[36:13] doesn't happen in the later scene age.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Adoption happens in the headstone.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; He says as she near that headstone
[36:20] should be so much in his image and
[36:21] likeness.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to shake yourself from
[36:25] that legian condition.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Do you know what happens when you
[36:30] believe you're in the legian condition?
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Do you know what where the greatest
[36:35] battle is fought?
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; It's in the mind. Yes.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; So which means you can be staying in
[36:39] amlanga rocks
[36:41] &gt;&gt; but I convince you you are staying in
[36:43] low amlanga.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; So that's the state of mind.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Let me not pick on Phoenix.
[36:55] Give me another area.
[36:59] Okay. Let's not pick areas. You're
[37:02] living in a palace.
[37:04] But I got you believing you're living in
[37:05] a squatty camp.
[37:09] So everything will be governed that you
[37:11] believing that your conditions are
[37:13] squatted cam conditions.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; So I'm saying I I'm actually bringing up
[37:19] to speed that we are not in the latest
[37:21] and age.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; He pulled us out. The shout pulled us
[37:25] out.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; What was the eagle story all about?
[37:30] &gt;&gt; The shout came to pull the eagle from
[37:32] the chicken
[37:33] &gt;&gt; from the later age. Hallelujah.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Which means you're no longer in Leosia.
[37:37] You're pulled into heavenly places.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; I never said there's an in age.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; I said he pulled you out of that seven
[37:47] church age and he took you into heavenly
[37:50] places.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; The dimension of the shout.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It'll you'll speak.
[37:56] It'll create itself right there. Now,
[37:58] the problem is people don't speak.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; That as well.
[38:04] We don't believe we possess the power to
[38:05] speak. Mark 11:23, "If I say to this
[38:08] mountain, be thou moved.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Don't doubt in my heart, but believe the
[38:12] words that I have said shall come to
[38:13] pass, it shall happen."
[38:17] He says, "We haven't seen powers like
[38:19] this coming to the church. I know it for
[38:21] a fact." Saint then he goes to the Now
[38:23] remember this is the scripture for
[38:25] little gods.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; This is the scripture where Jesus was
[38:30] teaching the disciples how to speak like
[38:32] Adam. Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; He spoke to the tree and the tree
[38:35] withered away. Then they come to him,
[38:37] "How did you do this?" Then he explains
[38:40] to them how sons ought to speak.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; This is a scripture that was unlocked by
[38:46] one man.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; No other man brought the scripture. No
[38:51] denominational prophet. Or Roberts
[38:53] didn't do it. Billy Graham didn't do it.
[38:55] No preacher TL Asborn. None of Fosworth.
[38:59] Nobody operated the scripture. But one
[39:01] man in this age unlocked Mark 11:23 to
[39:04] us.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; He was sitting there in the woods uh
[39:07] wondering about the world. He's sitting
[39:08] there and he says he looked at his
[39:10] Bible. He says, "I always wondered about
[39:12] Mark 11:23."
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; And the Lord is going to teach another
[39:19] Adam now how to speak.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "Didn't you come here on
[39:23] squirrels?"
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, I did.
[39:28] Now watch your daily situations.
[39:30] Sometimes God is putting us in
[39:32] situations where what we are going for
[39:34] is not there.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; And the things that we are looking for
[39:39] going you you find there's some
[39:41] disruption and it's not normal. We walk
[39:43] away frustrated.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Are we looking for the God moment in
[39:46] that?
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Then the you know the the Lord tells the
[39:54] prophet, "Well, why don't you speak?"
[39:55] Mhm.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; And that's for the first time
[40:00] an amateur God.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Operated the scripture.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Now watch God in his grace. It wasn't
[40:09] high level on the platform when the
[40:10] third pull
[40:12] &gt;&gt; was opened.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; It was in the It was in a hunting place.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; He was teaching his prophet.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; So God is going to use you and teach you
[40:23] even in your own home. Amen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe your cupboards are dry.
[40:31] You're running out of stuff.
[40:34] You wanted mutton biryani, but there's
[40:36] no mutton.
[40:41] Amen. Do you know there there are cases
[40:43] like that? Because we have luxury. We
[40:45] know if we don't have mutton now, I'll
[40:46] go ask my neighbor for 50 and maybe
[40:48] he'll give me.
[40:49] But do you know that there are places
[40:51] where they have no access? They can't
[40:53] even ask their neighbors, friends,
[40:54] family, or whatever. They've got to
[40:56] trust in God alone.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; And they pray that there's enough
[40:59] testimonies.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; They'll pray and they'll see it right
[41:04] there.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; God training us, God showing us the
[41:10] power that's within us. This is divine
[41:12] power that came with divine character
[41:15] being came because of the divine nature.
[41:17] Right? He says the placing of the
[41:19] church. Now whenever he says placing of
[41:21] the church that's called adoption right
[41:22] and adoption is only in the headstone.
[41:25] When the fullness of the power of the
[41:27] Holy Ghost comes into the church then
[41:29] the critics's mouth will be shut. It'll
[41:31] be for a short time.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Right. So it's going to be for a short
[41:34] time. So remember when something is
[41:36] pouring out in a short time you've got
[41:38] to be able to access it.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now remember when time
[41:43] and season comes around it don't last
[41:45] long.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Brothers I'm putting you on notice. The
[41:47] things we preached 3 months ago may not
[41:49] be applicable right now
[41:50] &gt;&gt; because that season has passed.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; But that was molding us and bringing us
[41:55] up to a level.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Did we not read that God has new
[42:01] promises for each new year?
[42:03] &gt;&gt; This is the prophet speaking now.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; He says God has promises for each new
[42:06] year.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; And he says, I want the promises for
[42:09] this year.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; But people still want to talk about
[42:13] yesterday. Mhm.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; The way the Holy Spirit was correcting
[42:16] us in the last season is not how he's
[42:18] correcting us now. Don't be stuck in a
[42:20] past season.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; If you're going through a season of
[42:28] drought in your finances, some people
[42:29] want to continually be stuck in that.
[42:31] But a season lasts 3 months
[42:33] &gt;&gt; in the natural. How about we go in the
[42:36] spiritual realm and command things
[42:38] around us and say a season ought to last
[42:40] three months alone.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm a son of God. Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Let this season pass."
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Do you know there's something about a
[42:49] season? It makes you do things you don't
[42:52] want to do.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; You see, Brother Kenny don't like
[42:56] jackets. Don't like jerseys. But when it
[42:58] gets extremely cold, the season changes.
[43:01] The season forces him
[43:03] &gt;&gt; to put on a jacket.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; The season will make you do things that
[43:08] you don't ordinarily like to do.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:14] Some people like to be warm, but when
[43:16] summer comes around, especially in
[43:17] Durban, it will force you to remove your
[43:20] jacket.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Remove your scarf.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; You don't see brother Joshua coming in
[43:24] the heat of summer with his scarf and
[43:26] his head and everything.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; What commanded that? The season.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; So God has us in different seasons of
[43:33] our life and different season are
[43:35] commanding us and requiring of us
[43:37] different things in our lives.
[43:39] Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. What am I saying? We've got to be
[43:47] moving with the Holy Spirit.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; I wish I had the quote right now. I was
[43:54] going to show it to you the other day.
[43:55] The prophet of God is saying that people
[43:58] want to be warmed by a painted fire.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. People want to be warm by a
[44:02] painted fire. He says they get into the
[44:04] sedoff trying to
[44:07] warm you up with the testimony from
[44:09] years ago.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[44:15] We are saying is the same yesterday,
[44:16] today, and forever.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; But now we'll tell you about a testimony
[44:21] that happened. Amen. A few years ago,
[44:25] &gt;&gt; maybe even longer than that.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; And we're expecting you to get warm by
[44:29] that.
[44:33] How many of you know what 50 years ago
[44:35] is called?
[44:38] It's called history.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; History is a picture.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; And I can't warm you with history.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; It can it can it can stir your faith,
[44:52] &gt;&gt; right? But the stirring of your faith
[44:55] must be able to say that I'm feeling
[44:57] cold today and I'm going to take some
[44:59] wood and I'm going to make a fire today.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; I'll say this again. How the Lord has
[45:12] been working with us. I'm not saying
[45:14] currently enough.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; We would normally go to a testimony and
[45:18] say how God worked in times gone by.
[45:23] Right?
[45:25] But we need to if we are really sons and
[45:27] daughters of God, we need to bring it to
[45:29] now.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; So which means the sick shouldn't be
[45:33] amongst us.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; We should be operating.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; If there be any sick amongst you, call
[45:41] the elders of the church.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Let them anoint you with oil. That's if
[45:45] you can't come to church now. There's a
[45:47] scripture for that.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; You're not able to come to church. So
[45:51] call them to your home. Let them anoint
[45:52] you with oil.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; If you got the faith of the centurion,
[45:55] you can send somebody and say, "Speak
[45:57] the word."
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Somebody is sick at home.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody in hospital, go pray for them.
[46:07] We've seen enough testimonies.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; You know, yesterday I'll give it. It
[46:12] sounds like such a minute testimony, but
[46:14] I'll just tell you nonetheless. So my
[46:16] brother-in-law went to China or was on
[46:19] his way to China. But you know that Iran
[46:22] blew up the US army base in Qatar or
[46:24] somewhere there. So they closed the
[46:26] airspace, right? So my sister was
[46:28] panicking because they couldn't land in
[46:31] Qatar. They had to redirect the flight
[46:34] and he went to I don't know which
[46:35] country he went to, but they lost
[46:37] connection with him.
[46:39] Right? So this was Monday night. Monday
[46:42] night we were doing home visitation. So,
[46:44] I never saw the message till late at
[46:47] night. So, I messaged her in the morning
[46:49] and I asked her, "Have you heard
[46:51] anything from Joshua?" She says, "And
[46:52] I've got the voice recording and I've
[46:54] got the timeline of it." And I want to
[46:56] show you how precise things can be.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; She just sent me a voice note to tell me
[47:01] she has not heard from Joshua since.
[47:04] So, my response was to be consoling.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; And I said, "It's okay. You'll contact
[47:12] you shortly.
[47:16] It may have sounded like a consoling
[47:17] word, but in the next minute he messaged
[47:20] her.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; The very next minute he messaged her.
[47:25] She she sent me another voice message.
[47:27] He just messaged me now. I said, "Go
[47:29] read reread what I just sent you."
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amenise.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; But we're talking about divine power and
[47:39] &gt;&gt; the power creative word.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. somebody who's uh lost touch with
[47:43] her husband
[47:44] &gt;&gt; for hours was panicked not knowing
[47:46] what's happening because they're closing
[47:47] hair spaces and I just tell her he'll
[47:50] contact you shortly.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; I didn't know he was going to contact
[47:53] her shortly but something within me said
[47:54] tell her this.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; And within the next minute he messages
[47:59] her.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; You carry a power within you.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. The problem is we are not
[48:11] exposing ourselves to harness that
[48:14] power.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet himself was
[48:17] rebuked. He said, "I let the sick lay."
[48:21] &gt;&gt; The prophet was so concerned about
[48:23] people. You know, there's a quote like
[48:24] that. He says, "But I let the sick lay.
[48:27] I didn't do enough. I always waited for
[48:29] him to push me to do things."
[48:31] &gt;&gt; You know, all of these things, right? He
[48:33] says, now I'm going to close here. The
[48:35] church still has power.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; God never taken his power from the
[48:38] church. Yes.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; But the church don't have faith enough
[48:41] to act upon it. That's all. It's just
[48:43] that simple.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just to type here what what
[48:51] what the prophet is saying, there's
[48:52] coming a time in this nation. Now,
[48:54] watch. He's also speaking here this in
[48:56] prophecy when this nation is going to
[48:58] exercise all the power that the beast
[49:00] had before it. And I'm telling you, we
[49:01] are seeing it now.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; We are seeing this nation exercise the
[49:06] power of paple Rome.
[49:09] Right? See, this nation will do that.
[49:12] Revelation 13 explains it. Okay? I want
[49:17] to get past this. I'm going to show you
[49:18] something here.
[49:24] Right? So, he says you'll have to be in
[49:26] the world council of churches. And now
[49:28] on persons like ourselves, we're going
[49:30] to be cut out of all that all together.
[49:33] Amen. It says he's tightening. And when
[49:36] that time comes, the press comes to a
[49:38] place where you're pressed out. And then
[49:40] watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a
[49:42] few minutes. Watch the third pulled in.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; See, it'll be absolutely to the total
[49:50] loss. It'll be for the bride and for the
[49:52] church. And I say this by the power of
[49:54] the revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[49:57] Everyone in our doctrine, in our
[49:58] baptism, we've come to a place, but
[50:00] there's some key to unlock something
[50:03] here. Now watch he's saying we need a
[50:05] key to unlock the power.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Don't miss this now. I'm closing. He
[50:09] says we need a key to unlock the power.
[50:12] And watch what he says. Then he goes now
[50:15] once he says we need a key to unlock the
[50:17] power. He says he saw a book on seven
[50:20] seals. Daniel saw the same. And when the
[50:23] thunders utter their voices don't write,
[50:26] but it'll re be revealed in the last
[50:28] days. We're at the time. We're at Kadesh
[50:30] right now. So what are you saying? The
[50:32] thunders will unlock the power.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; We need the power. But he's saying the
[50:40] seven thunders will unlock the power.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Right. Praise the Lord. He says here in
[50:46] paragraph 180, he says, "Wait till them
[50:48] seven thunders utter their voices to
[50:50] that group who really can take the word
[50:52] of God."
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Are we a group that can take the word of
[50:54] God
[50:56] &gt;&gt; and hand it there?
[50:58] &gt;&gt; It'll slice and cut. Now let me tell you
[51:00] something. Slice and cut is not a pretty
[51:02] thing.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Slice and cut is a time of war.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; You got to be a warrior.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Slice and cut means you are going to cut
[51:09] and chop. It's not a picnic.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; You're not cutting birthday cake here.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; You're in a war.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Seven thunders. The sword of the word.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; You slice and you cut.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; And they can close the heavens.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; They can close the heavens.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; They can shut this or do that
[51:37] &gt;&gt; whatever they want to.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Right. He'll be slayed by the word that
[51:41] proceeds from his mouth. Now watch how
[51:44] he's saying it. From his mouth. And I
[51:46] don't know if you know there are quotes
[51:47] where the prophet is saying, "God don't
[51:49] have no mouth but your mouth."
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; God don't have no hands but your hands.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; God don't have no feet but your feet. So
[51:55] out of his mouth, out of the mouth of
[51:57] the bride,
[51:58] &gt;&gt; thank you.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; He's coming forth the word. They can
[52:00] call for 100 billion tons of flies if
[52:02] they wanted to.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Whatever they say is going to happen
[52:06] because it's the word of God coming from
[52:07] the mouth of God.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; It's his word. He always uses man to
[52:15] work.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; God could have called him flies down
[52:18] there in Egypt, but he said, "Moses,
[52:20] that's your job." Praise the Lord. We
[52:22] know that point. Amen. We're moving now.
[52:23] He says, "The church is no longer the
[52:25] mouthpiece of God. It's his own
[52:27] mouthpiece." Talking about
[52:28] denominations. God is turning on her. He
[52:30] will confound her through the prophet
[52:32] and the bride.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; For the voice of God will be in her.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Hey, I know some of you like to read
[52:38] that the voice of God is in the prophet.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; But that's passed.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Are you reading this? He will confound
[52:44] her through the prophet and the bride.
[52:46] But then he says, "For the voice will be
[52:47] in her."
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; So, what is God calling on us to do now?
[53:02] There must be of necessity the return of
[53:04] dynamic power. And I'm saying the
[53:06] dynamic power is already in us. We need
[53:08] to have the faith to operate the power.
[53:10] We need to have the character to operate
[53:11] the power.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Then again, it's coming down. I could
[53:17] have said all of that and excited you
[53:19] that you have the power. But if you
[53:20] don't have the consecration, you can
[53:21] never unleash the power.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Do you know how many hours Jesus spent
[53:27] on the mountain praying? That's right.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; How many hours he spent morning, noon
[53:32] time, evening time
[53:33] &gt;&gt; to come maybe do one miracle.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he prayed and he
[53:40] fasted all night
[53:42] &gt;&gt; when he was going to choose his 12
[53:43] disciples.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. He comes down from up the mountain
[53:46] and he chooses his wealth.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; We when going for job interview, we tell
[53:52] the whole world to pray for us. You
[53:54] spend more time phoning everyone, hey,
[53:55] pray for me. Pray for me. Pray for me.
[53:56] Pray for me. I'm going for this. You
[53:58] yourself don't end up praying.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; You're sick. You're telling the whole
[54:03] world how sick you are, but you yourself
[54:04] are not praying.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; You're thinking you're sounding
[54:06] spiritual. Pray for me. Pray for me.
[54:08] Pray for me. What happened to your
[54:10] mouth?
[54:12] Amen.
[54:14] Amen. We've got to realize
[54:17] &gt;&gt; that the power of God is tabernacling
[54:20] us.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; I am the anointed one for the hour.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; When I'm saying that now, I mean, you
[54:27] must say that. Don't come quote me and
[54:29] said I said I'm the anointed man for the
[54:30] hour.
[54:33] Right? Which means Caleb is the anointed
[54:35] man. Both Calebs. Amen.
[54:39] Brother Kenny is the anointed man of the
[54:40] hour. Brother Nathaniel, brother
[54:42] Sunonny, brother Willie. Amen. Brother
[54:43] Joshua, brother Jeffford, brother Amen,
[54:45] brother Tyler, Brother Luke, Brother
[54:47] Kenzo. I am the anointed man of the
[54:50] hour.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; I carry the power of God within me. What
[54:55] kind of power you talking about? Let me
[54:57] show you. You see this power that says,
[54:58] "Let there be."
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; My prophet who I believe said that power
[55:03] lays in me.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] I really thought it had gone over time,
[55:12] but they hadn't. So, praise the Lord.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; We're on time.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Enough time to pray now because this is
[55:18] our winners in that prayer meeting.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, after preaching
[55:21] about dynamic power,
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; There shouldn't be one case here.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; That leaves this place
[55:29] &gt;&gt; without the prayer being answered.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; I remember I don't I think it was sister
[55:35] Crystal's testimony the last time when
[55:37] brother Joel came.
[55:39] Remember she sister Christelle came
[55:41] forward for prayer.
[55:43] Amen. And she had a nerve problem in her
[55:46] back.
[55:48] She came prayer line. She says she went
[55:52] home and it was gone.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; There must be of necessity be a return
[56:01] of dynamic power.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Here's brother Joshua sitting here.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Here's the evidence next to him.
[56:09] She probably got tired of his
[56:10] complaining about the back pain,
[56:13] &gt;&gt; but she knew there was an untapped
[56:14] resource that she could tap into.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; So they were there in the family altar
[56:20] and after they had all dispersed,
[56:23] brother Joshua was still having their
[56:24] pains,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; she comes back to him with and brother
[56:27] Joshua says, if you all know sister
[56:29] Vanessa, she's not very super spiritual.
[56:32] I can say like keep boasting and saying,
[56:34] you know, if you know what I mean. She
[56:37] doesn't portray herself as a super
[56:39] spiritual woman that say the Lord.
[56:43] But he says the countenance on her was
[56:44] different this time when she came and
[56:45] she says you're always complaining about
[56:47] your back. Let me pray for you.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; How many wives
[56:51] &gt;&gt; wonderful
[56:51] &gt;&gt; would have the courage to go pray for
[56:53] their husbands.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hey, they can shout at
[56:58] the husband.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; They can complain
[57:04] &gt;&gt; but pray.
[57:08] pray for the husband. So she goes and
[57:10] pray for him
[57:13] and she goes back simple prayer
[57:17] and brother Joshua has never taken
[57:20] another tablet.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; The pain completely left him.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; And he's never had a repeated episode.
[57:26] Even now we can testify it's been two
[57:28] years
[57:30] &gt;&gt; 2023, right?
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; And now it's winter. Did the winter cold
[57:34] affect you?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; No. But that's divine power.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; You see the power. Now, how many years
[57:40] were you suffering with that, brother
[57:41] Joshua?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Long. Very long.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Very long. But it took somebody who was
[57:46] said I now will access divine power.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; We know it was a a year filled with high
[57:54] powered preaching on the angel of the
[57:56] Lord.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; And that's what stirred the faith of the
[57:59] people.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; And we were talking about reestablishing
[58:02] the prayer life in everyone's home.
[58:05] Amen. And we started to see so many
[58:08] miracles and healings and testimonies.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; One after the other.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know all know the testimonies
[58:17] that were coming out.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? We can know something
[58:22] and then it can go dormant.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Like I'm saying, you got light
[58:28] bill, you got bread to buy, you got
[58:29] this, that, and the other. I'm saying
[58:31] with all of that, let's not forget that
[58:33] we are sons and daughters of God with a
[58:35] kingdom mandate.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; To advance the kingdom.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And God didn't of the south for nothing.
[58:44] He wants to use you and I in the same
[58:45] time.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; And whether you like it or not, God is
[58:49] coming now. You remember when he came to
[58:50] uh Sarah in Genesis 18, she was not
[58:53] ready. But whether she was ready or not,
[58:55] it was time and season.
[59:00] When when the angel came to me to Sarah,
[59:02] was she still doubting?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Was she still doubting?
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Did she laugh?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; But time and season. You remember I'm
[59:13] telling you about time and season? The
[59:16] season will bring upon you things and
[59:18] make you do things you never thought you
[59:20] would do.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; When the boy was returning back to his
[59:23] father, the prodigal, he was going with
[59:25] the mindset of I'll be a servant. But
[59:26] the season had changed. When he got
[59:28] home, his father said, "It's time for
[59:30] adoption." I don't know what you're
[59:31] talking about servant here.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Time and season has changed, church.
[59:34] Let's stand together. Give God praise.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Amen.
[59:44] Hallelujah.
[59:47] The power of God is in the church.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; The power of God is within me, within
[59:52] you.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God God can change circumstances.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Young lady, young man, if you trust God,
[1:00:03] you'll start to see things happen in
[1:00:04] your life even now.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you have even begin to
[1:00:08] start to witness things, things you
[1:00:09] never thought would happen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; God can establish you. God can do a work
[1:00:15] in your life.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Glory be to his
[1:00:21] name.
[1:00:23] Amen.
[1:00:24] What a mighty God we serve.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; What a holy God we serve.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when the power of God is
[1:00:33] released,
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; remember what he says. God will put a
[1:00:36] power into the church.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe thinking now, where's the power?
[1:00:41] Well, you need to pray the power.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost, the
[1:00:45] power comes with the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and there's nothing wrong with
[1:00:49] asking for a refilling of the Holy
[1:00:51] Ghost.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the prophet says the
[1:00:52] dynamics of this church will be a
[1:00:54] refilling of the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; So you don't need to leave this place
[1:00:59] the same way you came in.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to start now to put the
[1:01:05] word of God in your mouth.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; And I want you to begin to to start to
[1:01:09] speak things
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; because nothing will happen on this
[1:01:13] earth. Earth is effective by the power
[1:01:15] of your voice. Yes,
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham will go on and he
[1:01:18] preaches message and he'll tell you how
[1:01:20] the spoken word is the original seed.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Nothing else. The spoken word.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Not the revealed word.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; But the revealed word must become the
[1:01:30] spoken word.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just Amen. Let's just
[1:01:37] sing. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's sing uh
