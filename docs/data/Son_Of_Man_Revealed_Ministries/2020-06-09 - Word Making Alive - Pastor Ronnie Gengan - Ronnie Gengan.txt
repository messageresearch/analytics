also [Music] let's see who we are this morning amen father who we are while we are here god has made a way for us all right amen his words will never fail he's given us promises and he's got to keep his promise amen god is not like us we make a promise and don't keep it let us label therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of god is quick and powerful amen and sharper than any two-headed sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart praise the lord amen lord jesus we thank you lord for your grace once again we can be gathered here and lord we look around the country and around the world is millions are gathered millions of people are going to show the faith in god wherever they go they've got to show the faith in god but we thank you lord we can be gathered here little group we thank you for your word that you have sent to us yes that is keeping us alive amen yes that is what we are believing lord many amen gathered and they creed and a program or some other thing lord but we are gathered now by the revelation of your word amen you give you praise and glory thank you take away this morning all our doubts and gloom and doom and despair yes and maybe we put our faith in thy word yes but you said everything will pass away but your words will not fail and our faith is thank you thank you upon the word yes that you're provided for us in this day lord devil lord we surrender all to you this morning take our thoughts our hearts our mind and everything and maybe concentrating on you for your words a lot of faith covered by the hearing and yelling of the word let's forget all about what happens at home and what happens at work and what happens in the world we're not concerned about our soul and we concern about your promised lord be with us and bless us touch and quicken speak in love they that are not well yes lord we pray lord for sister kim and from the same delivery of the baby and you'll be with him the holy spirit yes lord be surrounded around them this morning lord bless our brother on the sunday this morning to pray lord for the speedy recovery lord yes blessings bless your will to our hearts now even as we have gathered here may our offer quick means to make a lie amen quick means to make a lie amen the word of god makes a lie and it's powerful how many of you know what powerful means yes powerful how many of you know what powerful means full of power the word of god is quick and powerful amen the word of god makes alive amen people can be gloomy and down and all but let the true word of god strike them place them alive amen so to make a line see sharper than the two-edged sword i don't know how many of you see the sword and i believe it's very sharp amen the brother described the sword when he fell into his hands amen he goes glistening man and he was scared of holding swords because they're very sharp that's right so the word of god is sharper than the sword amen amen so what the sword does in the i know in the old days they used to do the swords fight with the sword and if that can cut the guy's head off [Music] it was sharp [Music] because david never had a sword he killed him with a slingshot but he cut off his head with the saw amen and they say goliath was a big guy and you know 10 feet tall now with david the bible says he was running for him to take that sword and really swing it and cut his head that took the power of god amen he had to cut his head off so the word of god is quick powerful sharper than any two-edged sword amen it cuts asunder see the true word of god cuts the people amen amen you see where people are true that if god is speaking to them they get upset because the world cuts them when you tell them the truth when they get angry what is cutting them piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit see the word can divide and cut between the soul and the spirit amen praise the lord and of the joints and narrow the word of god can cut right there amen amen right in the middle [Music] and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen amen the word of god is a designer amen amen of our hearts the intent of our hearts which is the actions of our hearts the word of god knows the actions of our hearts praise the lord i'll be glad for that amen neither is there any creature that is not manifested in sight he knows all things amen he knows about every creature but all things but all things are making and open until the eyes of him with whom we have to do amen praise the lord so he knows all things the word of god is powerful and uh you can kind of sunder you know any part of your body can know the thoughts of our hearts and we've seen that in our day amen amen so it's a word of god knowing the secrets of the hearts yes amen the son of man was here amen the word making known the infants of the heart those people that were blinded and confused they said it's a man they said it's a mind reading mental telepathy but the word of god is powerful amen quicker than any two of the songs i was going to mention this but i forgot about this brony to my memory now we're going to give the young people some award all the young people male and female right i want you to go and find out look through all the message and find out all the marvelous things that god has done amen amen in healing and paradoxes amen amen many young people you're raising praise the lord right so you're gonna read your messages and find out all that what god has done in the message every healing record listed amen and outside of healing all that god deserved the hearts of the people telling them the secrets just list all that and paradoxes of supernatural things taking place amen because you can take this message and take it right down to the old testament amen and you can see that paradox is continued from there right to this day you know like elijah the man borrowed a hex and the hex fell into the water amen yes and he didn't know what to do borrow it you know like some people borrow things and don't return but this guy got worried now i'll put up this axe i need to return it elijah came to know about it he took a sticker through it in the water there and that hex that came swimming up amen amen against the force of gravity but god has done the same thing today many things yes right so what you're going to find out all those things we're living in the modern age we've got smartphones you've got that tablet there you've got the hub over there you've got the bible there you can go pick it all up easy right so we want you to come up with all those uh things that god has done and and you see how amazing thing is done god knowing the secrets of the hearts whether for healing or any other thing and he made it known to us in our day amen right so he knows the actions of the heart god knows the actions of our hearts amen right about and it says here as a man thinking it is so easy amen as a man thinks so easy what our thoughts are all the time that's what we are amen praise the lord what's our thoughts are all the time that's what we are right you can judge for yourself now amen let us examine our own selves what our thoughts are all the time that's what we are a lot of people like to break sometimes you know i'll never leave you i'll be with you i'll stand with you that same one goes away one turns on you the one that says i'll never leave you turns on you the one that shall never leave the message they left the message see so no man is better than his own word we can we can say something or make a promise and not keep it yes amen so he won't keep it so no man is better than his word right we can say make a promise break their promise now we know that whether when they say when promises are made during a time of marriage right people say i do but they don't yeah how many people that don't stand there oh because the priest is there all the people here will you be faithful to this wife will you have no other woman before that would you promise to love a cherished kid yes i do but they break it amen and this is a muslim it is secret this is standard because the prophet said the the message of marriage a divorce yes praise the lord amen we like to preach a lot about muslims huh there's mysteries here also american divorce the prophet said that's the opening of the word amen amen so people break the promise amen when you say to uh a boy or a girl you're uh especially the boy said i'm gonna marry you that's a promise amen the prophet says that's a promise you can't come next you know i made a mistake man i saw somebody else you know she looks a little bit better than you i think i'm making a promise now then the turn we could come no no no i saw somebody else not these things are true it happens so what you speak we got to keep the word amen because god knows when you tell somebody anybody anybody anything you must keep that word see you break it so don't don't give your promise to some uh some uh somebody that you think you love he said i'm gonna marry you you know there's nobody like you in the world i'm going to swim the seven seas for you huh then he got blown himself in the sea he can't manage so they don't keep up the world until death do us part how many people departed before there i mean y'all made no minutes until death do us part who is talking to who we making the promise before then they don't think about it amen and then they depart right but the father tells us god is not a man that he should lie amen when god said something he keeps his word and when he said he's going to take us as his bride he will keep the word amen amen if we take him as the word [Music] receive this word he promised we're gonna be his bride amen if you separate from all the things of this world and all denominations and organized religion and everything we say lord i thank you for your message amen i thank you for your word and i couldn't become this myself you brought me to him amen amen and he's going to take you through amen if you are faithful to him there is no divorce amen amen that's right you're going to be his bride absolutely see so the word of god is powerful amen quicker than any and sharper than any two-edged sword see very quick and powerful just to go through a few scriptures here now so that word quick needs to be made alive quick right let's go to ephesians chapter two and then uh we got uh we can follow the scriptures here [Music] i was thinking it would be nice we must follow the scriptures then we know it's written in the bible sometimes we even mention the scriptures but uh when you read it you know it's in the scripture right you feel in chapter two right the body says you're and since that now working in the children of disobedience the devil among whom also we are all we all had our conversation in entire past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and with our nature the children of god even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love whether he loved us even when we were dead in sins and quickened us amen made us alive amen amen brothers have brought us out of all the dead things quickened us together with christ amen praise the lord and be glad for that amen for my grace are you saved and that raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus praise the lord what a glorious thing amen see we're not hoping for our salvation by the grace of god yes and he's open the word and revealed to us quicken ourselves together with christ amen that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through jesus christ amen in the ages to come this is the last age amen amen and what he has done if you ever as it was in the days of sorrow happening it's a it's it's uh what what can i use it's a it's a pitiful thing it's a sad thing to see the conditions of the people in the world doesn't mean to say because we don't see things don't happen if you really can't see what's happening in the world people have real corrupted lies see and they prepare themselves for destruction so we thank god there is made a way for us made us alive amen acts chapter 10 let's read the scriptures acts chapter 10. amen now if more people say amen we're going to finish early amen so that you encourage me to preach also amen amen being soviet [Music] talking about [Music] the witnesses here him god raised up from the at the third day and showed him openly that means that jesus about jesus not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of god even us wouldn't eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify it is he which was ordained of god to be judged of quick and dead amen amen amen he's going to be the judge of the people made lie and they did it to him to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believed in him shall receive remission of sins amen and be glad for that amen he made a way for us second timothy chapter four you like to read the scriptures that you know it's something over there and the young people got some lovely research to do so don't wait till friday saturday daddy mommy you know what i said let's rush take your time amen all week we will find out all this thing that god has done amen right everybody second timothy chapter four therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the creek and the dead he shall judge the quick end of it amen those people that were made alive we shall judge the creek and the dead at his appearance and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not end your sound doctrine amen but after their own lust shall eat to themselves teachers and in itching years amen amen saying john chapter 6 in john 56 praise the lord you love the lord amen you know what you are saying amen you know you and the bride praise the lord we just know it amen yes if you say you're a bride you just know it amen we know that we have our mistakes we got our faults we get angry but that's got nothing to do with it amen we know we are safe we are here in our human elements also i mean the problem said we can't get on with our own selves if you can't get on with your own subject we get on with somebody else that's right so that must be the real grace of god amen so we thank god for that saint john chapter 6 reading for verse 63 what you will read from 62 and what what and if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before yeah he's standing right on the earth and talking now what and if you shall see the son of man ascend means growing up where he was before so before he came here he was there it is the spirit that quickeneth amen see the word of god is quick and powerful amen it is a spirit that quickeneth amen the flesh prophet nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen the words that speak unto you the word is created amen so his word is spirit and life amen so where is the word of god today amen with the churches praise the lord the world is here with the bride today amen amen and and god has given her the word and he will know what she must do with that word amen amen i'll be glad for that she knows what you must do with that word amen so the word of god his word is spirit and life amen see so jesus said now someplace he said in vain to men worship teaching for doctrine commandments of men in vain i think that is in the book of matthew that's in chapter 5 i think somewhere there so what we're feasting on today the body word of the son of man amen amen except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you've got no life in me that is where his word is yes praise the lord right so it is a spirit that quickeneth the spirit that quickeneth the flesh provided nothing the flesh prominent nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so when you're taking god's word you have life yes amen you have life don't don't believe that coke had no coke gives life they lie amen coke don't give life and some people say it's talking death isn't it but the words i speak unto you they are spirit in their life but there are some of you that do not believe jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not yes see we read the scripture there he knows everything deserve our thoughts intents of our hearts he knew from the beginning who won't believe yes praise the lord so you've got no problem that's what i say we know who we are but he knows who won't believe and they'll be part in the churches that go to church and fellowship and everything else but he knows from the beginning who don't believe right so that's his right now become the spirit jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him amen he do it and he was calm cool and collected that's right when judas was there he never got excited he knew he knew judas had a work to do he was born for that purpose he was born the son of petition isn't it so he knew somebody had to deceive him as the scripture also said and he said therefore i said you no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father nobody can come to god unless god has called us amen that's why you can go and plead and beg get everything to some people they will never come but it was intended of god for now when you're fishing there you throw that net in catches all types of fish yes all type of sea life you pull that metal you only take the fish all the others throw it back so you throw the gospel net down there lots of catch can come but there are genuine fishes there every time god we are rainbow trout amen we're not just any fish you know that signal of a fish is a christian amen that's right if you're driving and you see in the back of the car the signal of a fish they it means they are christian but we must put on our cars a rainbow trout we're special fish special fish costs a lot of money isn't it you really want some good fish you're gonna spend a lot of money 100 200 land and you can also get some jellyfish brother dennis will like jellyfish you know why he you got no teeth to tune him maybe we should get him some octopus praise the lord see so god knows amen nothing can be hidden from him amen and if that blood was predestined to come forth you'll come forth amen amen see we know the bible says there if it was possible the elect will be deceived because the spirits are there are so close they're deceiving the people with all that you know the gifts and all these wonders and and all this thing that's not the real gift the real gift is the word amen amen amen and they get to see by the directing some people get caught by the gift you know recently our basic people were running after a gift of some false prophet running after the gift see so the bible tells us that if it were possible but he said it's not possible amen amen for the elect to be deceived amen absolutely see we don't fall a hook line in sick see and it said that message people were falling for those things we know there is one god amen in the three officers father son holy spirit amen there was one elohim there was one self-existing one he was once elohim but today he's not elohim because he's got a family amen god is not living alone so there's no other hell of himself amen there's no false elohim amen because god is not anymore elohim he's not self-existing anymore amen he's got a many members see people are running after that false teaching of somebody claiming to be a hell of him and people are blinded and shouting and jumping and praising says elohim hello him elohim amen hello it is jesus christ now no more dwelling alone he came here to earth praise the lord so we thank god what what made us known to this thing the quickening power amen the word of god cutting us up there making us alive bringing the word to our remembrance amen since the world cuts apart the word cuts that's why when you preach the true word and people don't it catch them what is it the word the word cuts them when they don't want to believe in jesus christ said you preach the word it cuts them it says it's sharper than a two-edged sword amen so what is god got to cut so we had peter preaching one time stephen preaching and while he was preaching there telling them about how god promised to send jesus christ and he was the one that came and they took him and killed him and done all manner of things and the prophet spoke of him in all this thing so stephen was preaching acts chapter 7 let's go to that amen read it acts chapter 7 see so the word of god cuts the people he was preaching the gospel praise the lord bringing salvation and they didn't want it amen they were rejecting it see acts chapter seven let's read from 51 ye men were stiff-necked tell you what that is sharp and uncircumcised in heart and years are always resisting the holy spirit amen you are doing just as your fathers did amen wow that's going to cause for trouble now now what it is mean to be stiffnecked i don't know how many of you have stuffed naked in that baby yeah stiff neck the gun moved the next to see wow you know what you're gonna speak like that today they're gonna they're gonna pull up their socks see which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them and slew them before the coming of the just one of whom you have now been now the witness be now the betrayers and murders yes of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers wow that that sword is cutting that word being preached is cutting yeah huh it's coming them now and why religious men yes that's right yes people acknowledging god going to the synagogues and temples and and reading the scriptures and and praising jehovah god who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it when they heard these things they were kept to the hearts see what they wanted yes two i did salt cut them to the heart and they gnashed on him with the teeth see but he being full of the holy ghost looked up steadfastly to heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of your man praise the lord the son was cutting and everything they dash on the teeth they're ready to kill him and said beyond i see heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of god then they cried out to the lord voice and struck the years and ran upon him with one accord one of god they were all united with it and crashed him out of the city and stole them and the witness laid down the clothes at the young man's feet whose name was saul or later on at the damascus road experience and he was a messenger for the first age amen and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit amen see a christian can't die now he knows where he's going lord jesus received my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not the sin to the church and when he had said this he fell asleep he knew where he was going amen he fell asleep [Music] and you comfort on that resurrection morning amen he'll be quickened made a lie praise the lord amen the word of god cuts you know a lot of time you get people that are debating the word of god when they can't take what is being presented they can guest get into fights real fights can happen see the word of god make people fight yes one trying to prove i'm wrong the other one trying to prove i'm i'm uh sorry i'm right the other one proving i'm right they're getting the fights see so that's what the word of god does amen so what it says you know shall i speak so the people rejected the word they rejected the preaching now these men believe they were saying amen because they rejected the source that was there in their day to receive salvation to they christ it and what have they done today that god sent the message to the elected bride rejected the word so god sent the message to the elected bride what he says there shocked us out of those denominations amen what is that the word of god amen us out of those denominations see to make the world of god non-effect amen so that's why god had to send the message to make the word of god non-effect by saying the days of miracles is fars and only those men receive the holy ghost in the upper room nobody else can get the holy ghost nobody must pray and cast out devils since the conviction was not given but it's all day in the bible amen these sons shall follow them they believe amen scholars led by the devil said no no no that's not in the original manuscript it was added later huh these sons shall follow them the glee amen amen so that the bride the bride to be word part of a sin cannot be received see the bride that is part of in the world cannot be deceived right so eve came under the inside of heaven and was deceived and adam was straightened he was first image of god then he was put in the flesh he was given dominion power authority amen he was the enemy to god and he came out of him but got deceived but this bride came back from christ's side amen amen cannot be received amen it's not possible for that to be deceived amen see she came up from his side amen she's part of him cannot be deceived praise the lord now jesus will be the word he'll never be the word the word of god is freaking powerful sharper than any two edges so let's go to revelation 19. revelation 19. so you follow the scriptures here you know it is written young people you know it is written you know the pastor read the scripture there it's written amen amen see god knows all things you know something about god he knows all things amen amen he doesn't forgive there was a case where i rented some time back and uh there was a person that died and went to heaven and things like that and was uh was asked a question who is your god and he didn't know he says he wasn't saving god who is your god then sometime in his young boy days he remembered going to a sunday school just a sunday school and he heard something about jesus and the voice said again who is god and the voice said say jesus amen and then and then you remember in sunday school you hear about jesus so god knows you can look way back and he said somebody said jesus germans came to him [Music] see so god knows everything amen many cases like that so when you read the word you know now you know what the word is so revelation 19 let's see now who he is now the word reading from verse 11 now this is when jesus is coming now we find we are living in the in the prophetic times the scriptures are being unfolded yet we find in the last week or two so many nations have become friends with israel yes signing agreements of working together and an economy and business and all this thing now we have the letters i was reading this morning serbia and crossover they're there in europe they were in one of those two countries but they have made a peace agreement with israel and they're moving their embassies to israel right and then we've got saudi arabia then we've got uh bahrain dubai there uae american there's 22 arab nations possible to make peace with israel now they are recognizing israel to be a nation and jesus said watch the fig tree [Music] when you see the what's putting forth right from 1948 right up to now now they say no we recognizing you as a nation and there's a few that iran and others that you know we won't recognize them and we're going to bomb them and everything else now in the making friends with all these other nations and they're going to be strengthened by military might and all those bases are going to build over there to withstand the enemy what's the number one is iran right so jesus said now look at all these things happening now we're living in those times see which country want to make peace with israel they're all enemies all right see now the other muslim countries going to get angry said no you're making peace with israel and contention is going to be amongst them that's palestinians and all so these things are not happening without the reason scriptures are being fulfilled see so sorry so this is happening after all the nations are going to come for israel amen and the y is going to start and jesus is going to come to the rescue right so reading from verse 11 and i saw heavens open and beyond the white house and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he not judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire wow revelation 1 revelation 10. his eyes play my fire on his head with

relationship with the sword of his mouth gonna destroy the nations that come against israel he's going to feed them to the birds of the air [Music] even revelation 17 and 18. see the roman system the highland church gonna feed them up to the birds the bible says that okay let's go quickly the message here i think it's shalom notice you must begin in the music like he did get in the rhythm of him get into the promised world amen amen get into the promised world so the promise of not saying get me to a program get into the promised world see the way he done it at the beginning see the way he done it in the middle age see the way he does it now always the same amount he will steady night amen the spirit of god working in every age jesus christ is saved yesterday two and forever watch the director how he does it if he doesn't do it if he points you to some organization there never was a director done there a director always pointed you to the one praise hello the prophets of old pointed to the world they was the word they lived the word what did he do it manifested god amen amen that brought the written word for that day to life amen amen they brought the written word from that day to life amen and what did they do today the same thing amen brought the written word to life because laying day in the scriptures dormant luke 17 malachi 4 revelation 10 ronnie to life amen and what did he do okay brought you to life because it come to them it was revealed to them that was the rock so the word of god makes alive what is all this happening it's god making the world alive jesus christ god's word he is our rock amen aren't you glad jesus christ god's word is our rock amen upon this rock i'll build my church the revealed word of god he said shadow to reveal the believer peace we are the end time oh this rock i'm disrupt i will rule my church then revelation of the world amen praise the lord so that is where the real church is the rock the revelation of his word that's where she's built on it's not creeds and programs and do this and don't do that come on it's a man washing pots and washing hands no upon bulma church saying that god is called and revelated we are his church praise the lord one said well you're a great man you're like moses you're a great man you're like that ain't it but the revelation said that was the son of god he said flesh and blood never revealed it to you but my father which is in heaven upon this revealed truth amen so brian do not fear your faith is on the revealed words [Music] so we know who we are amen we're not doubting whether we're going to be saved if our faith is in the word of god and it's a real word of god and the scriptures have been made alive then it was advanced of god for us to believe it otherwise we can't believe it what is it 168 of shalom what is it he is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was god and the word was where was god and the word was god and the word is still god amen see what is that god the prophet is gone but we got the word of god men spoke led by the holy spirit and they had words so the words that men spoke became the word of god meant for the holy ghost when spied to speak that became the word of god amen now we've got to accept that by faith and believe it because you got atheist theologians doubters they say listen yeah we don't want to believe that new testament it's words by men you take these debates like you know he got this uh debaters debating about jesus and the bible and god creation and all here but the bible says holy men moved amen amen by the spirit of god we're inspired to write just like in our day god said to the prophet take up your pen and write that became the word of god amen so that's what peter said the word of god is of no private interpretation amen private interpretation if the word of god said it believe it amen amen can't make it any other way so you spill the word the same yesterday same today manifest as he was moses and elijah on down and jesus the same god today makes him jesus save yesterday today forever see he will stand in line they never pointed you to a group they pointed you to a person

following the rhythm of the world amen if repair is the first thing in recognizing to do that that's your first step put your next step where the work says on and on and marching on within keep marching with the word see if this is the time that we don't need any distraction keep matching with the world oh he's yeah he's there he's in jonah's birth he's in general said well no keep marching

for his written he knows all about it he knows the rhythm don't ask why praise the lord you must press under the word don't ask why don't ask this gunner's death press over the word amen god has moved down through the time of history with his promised world in each age and has never failed to break the rhythm by the power of god when it comes to the elected and vindicated people amen praise the lord they they're staying in the rhythm of the world praise the lord we're not looking for new light we're not looking for some news somebody to follow amen we're following the rhythm of the world amen the rhythm of his word in the days of noah the rhythm of his word in the days of noah in the days of moses in the days of elijah in the days of john in the days of david in the days of jesus on god he keeps the rhythm of the word light on down never as broke he has come right down through history and the elected seed that seed it and believe it fall right into the river with it praise the lord so we're not wasting our time here following the rhythm of the world amen something said no i know i must go join that church i must not join that church people can join whatever church the one you better be predicted the church is not going to see you through amen true amen see just make sure you predestinated and the predestination will stay with the rhythm of the world amen the others say

age he said well i tell you brother i can't look ahead then look up amen look up amen god promised if we look up say him shalom peace god's peace bless with you amen if people are getting confused look up from whence come with our help praise the lord see we don't have to be look up we say that why don't others make fun of people and blind you know others make fun of me and say i got long hair i'm old-fashioned see to the woman the men because i believe the bible you don't have fellowship with us no more we can't accept you because you believe such and such who cares who mothers as long as we are in the rhythm of the world amen and you know it's exactly the way the word is written god is duty bound to you to back that up then he certainly is don't matter about that why they say to make fun of see god is a jealous god remember suffering for his word sake his growing pains of his grace amen when you suffer for his work say it's just growing pains amen so you know people can suffer for the world that's why they stopped steven he was suffering them preaching the word for people to stay with them through what they're going to suffer amen so see people jericho and say no this is that but we are pressing onto the rhythm of the world it's growing pains of god's grace see said god not you know i don't want any problem in my life every true child of god must be chastised true child of god must you know go through this testing every true child see and the prophet said if they can't do that then they don't know who the father is amen you've got to be tried you got to be tested oh lord you know i'm serving you so faithfully lord you know i'm keeping your word lord i'm saving you why must you go through this problem growing let us suffer a while with the light afflictions the bible says we cannot be compared what is prepared for us why must we suffer do you know we suffering every day there's nobody that doesn't suffer to get up in the morning it's a suffering thing huh i mean you went to bed you're supposed to be arrested now you know you got a nice slumberland battles and everything but you're getting up for the decade but you're getting up for the back pain now then you're going to complain to somebody says normally not you're going to put a board under the bed put a wall tonight and make it hard rest assured and i don't know crown prince and crown distance fight crowns and elbow clowns i don't know what but people suffer everything is a suffering you're going to suffer everything you're going to go there suffer and i must have brushed my teeth must have gone have a shower now master god dress up but i'll tell you what if you don't want to go through those things be like an animal feel like the elephants be like the lions feel that they don't get up in the morning you know brush their teeth and i'm sure they've got a good breath they don't get up and they say you know what ain't no toilet paper in the house today they're they're enjoying their lives and the place is kept clean they're cleaner than humans you go to the kruger park and see how clean it is but you go to the cities where humans are like a pitch time see they don't get up they don't get up what must i wear today god gave them the eternal clothing everlasting clothing huh they're not gonna look at the mirror every morning see mrs gillard don't go there no i must wait for some nice they look nice every day after the unit goes to admire them see the humans going to say this thing never bought and never brushed the teeth and i don't know when last you took a shower and all this

know in the kitchen i must go so what you must get up there for the plane to get out for the oil you get hot somebody must get hot see we're all suffering but one day it'll all be over now what the angels are eating you think the angels are having a shower every day maybe that's why it's raining you think they're wondering about grocery stores and supermarkets and all this thing no yet there's angels there how do they do we're going to be like that one day but in the millennium we're going to eat it all but we won't be suffering praise the lord so it's growing pains now all the suffering is growing pains praise the lord so just know that god has made a way for us he brought us to all his growing pains since he said uh further down they says we must be a part of the world not a part of the creed part of the world not a part of a church a part of the bride god church is condemned we know that she goes into other darkness but the bride goes up praise the lord i'll be glad for that the word of god is quick and powerful sharper than maybe two edges and that is what we got that's why when the prophet was confused now what's going to happen he had that great blast over there and he said now my uh god is going to take me away is it for me to go because he said nobody can stand the blood the blast then he wondered now what is this he told his wife he said you know what you think i don't think so then he said no i seen little joseph there so he knows now you can't go because joseph was there amen the nearly one morning holy spirit said go up the mountain day we went to cebino canyon and when he went there all those rocks around there and between there's a v-shaped place there the sun was glistening to that one place and the holy spirit go there you want to know what this is all about and while he was standing prey a sword fell in his hand with the hand and a twisting curl and he said he's real so he says where'd this thing come from in the mountains nobody around and he says now what is this am i going to be knighted you know i'm honored as a great man because i believe they use that time one day the making they call it the night calendar ghd then the voice and spoken said no this is the king's sword not aching so the king's sword brother this is the word of god go back east to jeffersonville it's time for the opening of the seals that's right what is it the word the opening of the word the sharp two-edged sword and the prophet said it takes a strong arm of faith to handle this word to cut preach the word be instant in season other season rebuke exalt some people like one sissified preacher must have cut and rebuke the bible scuttle rebuke pull some out of the fire the word of god is quick and powerful that's why you find all these guys 65 joel or steve do you find him cutting that saw a word in the sword you're very preaching that word like a cutting sword no god is going to prosper you are you going to be uh you know rich god is going to bless your business no cutting sword when you look in that audience there you can see the word me to be preached to the woman that running paint and lipstick and shots and slacks oh 65 bleachers you can't preach about sin the holy ghost keeps away sin so you're going to preach it don't say people in the bride don't sin the greatest sin is unbelief they do all the wrong because they don't believe the word and the bible says if the righteous is scarcely saved where will the ungodly and the sinner appear amen so the word of god must be preached it was cut but divine let's go to the meadow huh the holy ghost keeps the church clean amen see so that's why the word of god must preach sometimes to cut us to mold us to shape us nothing else can do that amen a program can't do that i'm gonna stop right now because it's gone two hours two hours i never preach for two hours but it's gone two hours praise a lot you love him amen he is our sin he is our refuge amen so what it is it's the world what is keeping allah al-assad the holy ghost and fire is keeping us alive praise the lord amen spend time with that word stay with the rhythm praise the lord amen it's standard not to focus anywhere else just observe what's happening and be faithful to the lord amen amen we're going to look at life that is what shakes the devil we can come and tell the devil all the mysteries we know but sometimes he can make us run because he'll say all right now and silence and over who are you amen amen amen see it's a it's a life love that shakes the devil see if we can know all the mysteries we can give our body to be burned and all this thing but we haven't got love we're like a tinkling brass and a symbol praise the lord so the word of god is quick and powerful and that word of god somewhere along the landscape quicken us cut us up when we're doing wrong that word cuts us up see the word of god recognized makes us recognize who we are like jesus now the word of god was quickening and when mary said your father and i look for you he said who is my father who is my mother that was cutting amen who is my father who is my mother quickening power the word of god is sharp and nice powerful quickening and one day the prophet the word of god so inspired him and said charles and ella are brandon they're not my parents the same with us don't go to your parents and tell them i'm not your son i'm a son of god but he said i am not the son of charles and ella man praise the lord he knew he had a heavenly father i'd be glad for that so we know who our father is our parents were only instrumental bring us here but the word cut us in quickness made us alive to who we really are praise the lord so let's just rejoice in the musicians come amen praise the lord so you know who you are you know some other preachers reach over here to make comments and to say you are very observant and [Music] you know they love the response from the congregation although there's not
