[0:00] amen and god takes away life
[0:03] the bible says through everything
[0:05] there's a season there's a time there's
[0:07] a purpose under the heavens
[0:09] amen we will answer amen
[0:14] amen we'd like to take our scripture
[0:16] reading this
[0:18] day from the book of first days
[0:38] scripture says
[0:44] that you saw or not even as others
[0:48] which have no hope
[0:51] so that's a christian sorrow amen
[0:55] it says be sorry not even as others
[0:58] who have no hope though we will miss our
[1:00] sister that we will enlist our mom
[1:02] amen and may be heartbreaking at times
[1:05] but our sorrow is with hope amen
[1:09] jesus christ amen for we believe that
[1:12] jesus died and rose again
[1:14] even to them who told us to sleep in
[1:16] jesus will god
[1:17] bring with him for we say this unto you
[1:20] by the word of the lord
[1:21] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:23] the coming of the lord
[1:24] shall not prevent them who shall sleep
[1:27] for the lord himself shall be sent from
[1:29] heaven with a shout
[1:38] amen
[1:43] [Music]
[1:52] amen
[1:54] shall rise first then we which
[1:57] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:59] together with them in the clouds
[2:01] to meet the lord in the air and so shall
[2:04] we ever be with the lord
[2:05] wherefore comfort one another with these
[2:08] words
[2:09] amen let's powerful pray our loving
[2:13] heavenly father lord your grace words
[2:17] we cannot fathom over it's truly an
[2:20] unmerited favor oh god
[2:24] when we look back on our lives it's
[2:25] nothing we have done nothing we've
[2:27] deserved oh god
[2:28] but it was only by your grace father
[2:31] we looked through life and saw how you
[2:33] let us do lord
[2:35] and you brought us away from different
[2:37] backgrounds maybe trapped in
[2:39] hedonism and catholicism and all
[2:42] different kinds of
[2:43] religions but she led us so faithfully
[2:46] oh god
[2:46] and you brought us to the same knowledge
[2:48] of our lord and savior jesus
[2:50] christ we thank you for your love and
[2:52] your mercy this
[2:53] day father and we thank you lord jesus
[2:55] even as we come
[2:57] to our last respect to the mortal
[3:00] remains of our dear sister
[3:02] yoga we pray lord that you reveal the
[3:04] family lord and
[3:05] grant them peace and comfort at this
[3:07] time oh god
[3:09] and we pray over everything that will be
[3:10] said and done today oh god bless the
[3:12] heroes of the world
[3:13] and i pray lord that your mighty angel
[3:16] will come down and speak oh god
[3:18] for the words of life to give us hope
[3:20] and account for the lord jesus
[3:22] we commit everything to your hands in
[3:24] the mighty name of our lord and savior
[3:25] jesus christ
[3:30] amen
[3:40] a faithful godly christian wife
[3:44] a mother a sister a friend
[3:50] we can see the grace of our lord jesus
[3:52] christ upon the family
[3:54] that has given them peace amen
[3:58] a peace that passes all human
[4:00] understanding
[4:02] and we know that jesus said that the
[4:04] comforter the holy spirit
[4:06] will come amen and give us that comfort
[4:08] that we need
[4:10] many thoughts will be shared today and
[4:12] as we
[4:16] amen and we can say many things but the
[4:20] most important thing that
[4:21] our life and that testimony speaks
[4:23] louder than anything that we could ever
[4:25] say
[4:27] amen she was full of the spirit of god
[4:29] and life of christ
[4:31] the life of christ was reflected through
[4:33] her
[4:36] amen our journey beyond any shadow of
[4:42] doubt
[4:43] we know that this beautiful godly mother
[4:45] sister maggie
[4:46] has certainly made this preparation
[4:50] and right now she is in the place that
[4:52] she has prepared to go
[4:58] [Music]
[5:04] [Music]
[5:06] but the lord chose to call him about
[5:08] three weeks ago
[5:11] and with the ramesh and his family have
[5:12] made it faithful serving the lord
[5:15] in the message of the hour
[5:19] they've been faithful to the fellowship
[5:22] faithful to the believers
[5:24] they never wavered in serving the lord
[5:27] brother is one who has the spirit of
[5:29] praise upon him
[5:31] amen is always praising the lord and
[5:33] trust in the lord and thanking the lord
[5:35] no matter how big the situation is
[5:37] you'll always hear me praising the lord
[5:40] sister maggie himself was a true
[5:42] worshiper jesus at one time i told the
[5:45] woman
[5:46] the father is seeking those that will
[5:47] worship him in spirit
[5:49] and truth and i believe our sister mahdi
[5:51] was such a worshiper
[5:53] she worshipped the lord in spirit and
[5:55] himself
[5:57] amen and if given an opportunity
[6:01] all of us would like to look beyond the
[6:02] curtain of time
[6:06] [Music]
[6:17] amen saying this is what you preach
[6:19] about pastor ronnie amen
[6:20] and we're so glad that you came so that
[6:23] we can make it to this place
[6:25] amen get a glimpse into that sixth
[6:29] dimension
[6:31] because man has always had three
[6:32] questions like the prophet of god says
[6:35] amen those three questions are where did
[6:37] i come from
[6:39] who am i and where am i going
[6:43] and he says
[6:48] [Music]
[7:00] amen
[7:02] so we'd like to answer some of these
[7:03] questions very briefly and very quickly
[7:05] amen
[7:06] where do i come from tells us in
[7:09] ephesians
[7:10] 1 and verse 4 that we were chosen in
[7:12] christ
[7:13] amen from before the foundation of the
[7:16] world
[7:16] before god created the heavens and the
[7:18] earth we existed in his eternal thoughts
[7:22] amen our lord jesus told us in john 13
[7:25] verse 3
[7:26] that he came from god and he went back
[7:28] to god
[7:34] the lord jesus christ was taken from his
[7:36] very own side amen
[7:38] so if he came from god and bring it back
[7:40] to god then we came from
[7:42] are going back god god amen
[7:46] genesis 1 27 says god created man in his
[7:49] own image
[7:52] [Music]
[7:54] amen god created man in his own image
[7:58] in the image of god he created him male
[8:00] and female he created them
[8:03] we want to declare this morning
[8:11] [Music]
[8:18] amen so you ought to be thankful to the
[8:20] lord amen
[8:31] but there must be preparations made for
[8:38] her
[8:41] [Music]
[8:52] i'm sure that all of us do the same amen
[8:57] when we are expecting to receive a child
[8:59] into this world there is a great amount
[9:01] of planning
[9:01] and preparations made and as good as
[9:11] into this world how much more
[9:14] preparation
[9:15] does our heavenly father make amen
[9:19] god for every one of us
[9:23] amen god is here for his specific
[9:26] purpose
[9:28] and the purpose of god will never be
[9:34] defeated
[9:37] [Music]
[9:57] [Music]
[9:59] amen we know that man is a spirit
[10:04] we place so much emphasis on the human
[10:06] flesh by the real you
[10:09] many of us have never met never seen
[10:12] amen because man is a spirit
[10:16] he possesses
[10:29] ugly experience
[10:35] [Music]
[10:45] body we are taught when
[10:49] the mind is ready to deliver the baby
[10:51] the spirit of god is with the spirit of
[10:53] the sister
[10:55] each and every one of us waiting to
[10:57] enter that body
[11:03] [Music]
[11:08] amen so to answer the question very
[11:11] briefly
[11:11] where do i come from
[11:20] [Music]
[11:23] amen and all those that receive jesus
[11:26] christ
[11:29] [Music]
[11:33] moving on to the next question who am i
[11:39] romans 18 verse 14 says so as many as
[11:42] led by the spirit of god
[11:44] they are the sons of god
[11:47] for we have not received the spirit of
[11:48] bondage again to fear
[11:50] but you have received the spirit of
[11:52] adoption whether we were
[11:56] spirit itself bearing witness with our
[11:58] spirit that we
[11:59] are the children of god and if children
[12:01] their ears
[12:02] is our god and joins us with christ
[12:06] he shall be that we suffer with him that
[12:08] we may also be glorified together
[12:11] ephesians 1 and verse 5 says having
[12:14] predestinated us
[12:16] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[12:18] christ
[12:19] himself according to the good pleasure
[12:21] of his will
[12:23] and the apostle paul admonishes us
[12:25] knowing not you are the temple of god
[12:27] and the spirit of god dwelleth in you
[12:31] so we are really sons and daughters of
[12:34] the most high god
[12:36] many people make pilgrimages they go to
[12:39] asia they go to the
[12:40] buddhist place trying to find where they
[12:43] came from
[12:44] try to find some peace but the bible has
[12:48] all the answers
[12:50] amen you may have been born towards your
[12:54] parents
[12:55] they may have given you your name not
[12:57] even took care of you
[12:59] raise you up in the ways of the lord
[13:02] [Music]
[13:04] amen
[13:13] [Music]
[13:19] [Music]
[13:29] amen he repeatedly started to reveal
[13:32] himself to us
[13:34] amen there came a certain point
[13:37] when god started to reveal himself to
[13:39] you
[13:41] and every person must come to understand
[13:43] that we were born in sin
[13:45] shitty we came into
[13:50] [Music]
[13:56] [Music]
[14:00] physical but eternal separation from god
[14:05] so as we begin to grow all these things
[14:07] seem strange to us
[14:09] when we came across the word of god we
[14:12] heard the first sermon preached
[14:17] [Music]
[14:25] [Music]
[14:35] [Music]
[14:42] amen then we see the spirit of god the
[14:45] holy spirit
[15:03] [Music]
[15:21] [Music]
[15:24] with that purpose in mind she served a
[15:26] husband
[15:29] because only the world taught her how to
[15:31] be sufficient
[15:35] amen with that purpose in
[15:39] three mind daughters
[15:43] amen
[15:46] and the prophet god tells us the mother
[15:48] is that full gospel
[15:52] amen growing up the children probably
[15:56] don't read the first four gospels maybe
[15:58] they can't
[15:58] understand it or comprehend it but the
[16:00] mother has a way of raising them up in
[16:02] the ways of the lord
[16:03] she becomes gospel
[16:07] teaching the children at home
[16:10] amen instilling godly values within them
[16:22] [Music]
[16:27] she was submissive and loyal to her
[16:28] husband as she raised the children in
[16:31] the ways of the lord
[16:34] we come to our final question where am i
[16:37] going
[16:40] where am i going
[16:43] but now you know that if you are
[16:44] following the lord jesus christ
[16:47] we only want to go where he leads us
[16:51] but we want to get our answers from the
[16:52] bible
[16:54] so in john 14 2 says in my father's
[16:56] house
[16:57] are many mansions
[17:01] there are many theories
[17:13] [Music]
[17:31] that's where we're going where he is
[17:34] there we will be also
[17:38] amen revelation 14 13 says
[17:41] and i heard a voice from heaven to me
[17:44] right
[17:45] bless another day which died in the
[17:46] world from henceforth
[17:48] yesterday the spirit that they may rest
[17:50] from their labors
[17:52] and their words amen to
[17:56] follow them their words to follow them
[18:01] because you are not you do not go in and
[18:03] buy your words
[18:06] you go to heaven by the grace of our
[18:08] lord and save jesus christ
[18:10] that is why the bible is so clear the
[18:12] words follow them
[18:14] the words didn't go before them and say
[18:16] it's because of this thing i've done it
[18:25] one year
[18:29] there's so many people that the lord is
[18:32] choosing to call home at this time
[18:35] people made this thing sweeping the
[18:37] earth
[18:38] it's a plague that's going around them
[18:42] you know they talk about peter standing
[18:44] at the gates of heaven
[18:47] and welcoming people in but suddenly now
[18:51] there seems to be a great influx into
[18:53] him but i want you to know that david
[18:54] was not
[19:04] [Music]
[19:09] together but god is in control of all
[19:12] things
[19:16] i'd like to take you to that place if i
[19:18] can for just a minute
[19:20] of where our sister is
[19:34] [Music]
[19:36] to get to space
[19:40] they launched a man up in a rocket and
[19:42] put launching into space
[19:45] they imagine they knew that whoever
[19:46] which space first would be the next
[19:47] superpower
[19:48] then it was a quest to go to the moon
[19:52] amen they were looking for
[19:56] life in other planets they were looking
[19:59] for
[19:59] extraterrestrial activity ufos
[20:02] unidentified flying objects
[20:07] amen but while they were launching man
[20:11] into space and launching man to the moon
[20:15] god had a prophet on the earth and god
[20:19] took him to that real place
[20:21] he met the place the man was seeking for
[20:25] they were eternal place where there was
[20:28] life
[20:31] god took this prophet
[20:38] [Music]
[20:45] [Music]
[20:46] entering that sixth dimension he said
[20:49] that i looked at young women
[20:53] maybe in the early 18-20
[20:55] [Music]
[20:56] they were throwing their arms around him
[20:58] and screaming
[20:59] our precious brother
[21:05] he says here come young men i want you
[21:07] to notice his description now
[21:10] in the brilliance of young men
[21:14] their eyes glistening and looking like
[21:17] stars in a darkened night
[21:22] their teeth as white as pearl
[21:25] and they were screaming and grabbing me
[21:27] and screaming all our precious brother
[21:30] he says there was no yesterday
[21:33] not tomorrow if there's no yesterday and
[21:36] no tomorrow then that's eternity
[21:39] there's no time there they didn't get
[21:42] tired
[21:45] he said i've never seen such pretty
[21:47] woman in all my life
[21:49] and as beautiful as sister maggie is
[21:51] right here she's in the brilliance of
[21:53] the huge right now
[21:55] he says i've never seen such pretty
[21:58] women in all my life
[22:01] they had hair down to their waistline
[22:04] long skirts to their feet and they were
[22:07] just funny
[22:08] he says i don't have the vocabulary
[22:14] [Music]
[22:24] he said and he heard the angel telling
[22:27] this is what you preached was the holy
[22:29] ghost
[22:30] this is perfect love and nothing can
[22:33] enter
[22:34] here without it he says
[22:40] [Music]
[22:53] sister maggie has gone back to eternity
[22:57] like jesus said i go to prepare a place
[22:59] for you
[23:00] in my father's house are many mansions
[23:03] theories
[23:04] celestial bodies perfect bodies
[23:10] in closing we'd like to read this
[23:13] scripture that's
[23:14] fitting for our sister
[23:20] and i was not aware that they had
[23:22] printed it
[23:23] on the front cover of this
[23:27] proverbs chapter 31
[23:30] he says who can find a virtuous woman
[23:33] for her christ is far above rubies
[23:38] the heart of her husband don't safely
[23:41] trust in her so that he shall have no
[23:44] need of spoil
[23:46] she will do it good and not evil all the
[23:53] [Music]
[24:17] strength and honor are a clothing
[24:20] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[24:24] she voted with wisdom and in her tongue
[24:28] is the law of kindness she looked well
[24:31] into the ways of our household
[24:33] and eaten not the greater idealness a
[24:36] children
[24:37] arise up and call her blessed
[24:41] a husband also a praiser
[24:44] [Music]
[24:55] amen it says many daughters have done
[24:58] virtuously
[25:03] is deceitful and beauty is vain but a
[25:06] woman that feared the lord
[25:08] she shall be praised
[25:12] and let words praise them in the gates
[25:17] our own words testify for our own life
[25:20] testify our experience with the lord
[25:22] jesus christ
[25:24] and our sister margie has been a dear
[25:25] faithful sister
[25:27] in the house of the lord
[25:30] she married the lord she made jesus a
[25:33] lord and savior
[25:34] and she chose to form him to sickness
[25:38] to health amen through any situation
[25:42] and she never pursued this message of
[25:44] the hour
[25:46] she loved the message and i believe
[25:49] he was a brave woman amen she always
[25:52] taught the children to pray and trust
[25:53] the lord
[25:54] and seek the face of the lord
[25:59] so we remember the words of david after
[26:01] he had lost his son
[26:03] he said i cannot go to him or sorry he
[26:06] cannot come
[26:08] to me but i can go to him so having
[26:11] asked us three questions
[26:13] where did you come from who are you
[26:18] and where are you going
[26:21] do you know the lord jesus christ
[26:25] jesus was very explicit
[26:29] there's not many ways that lead to god
[26:32] i want to declare to you there is only
[26:36] one way to heaven
[26:51] must enter through christ so even as we
[26:54] close now
[26:55] we want to leave you with those thoughts
[26:58] if you truly want to know
[26:59] where you came from who you are
[27:02] and where you are going to come to jesus
[27:08] you will find all the answers that you
[27:09] need
[27:11] amen let us stand together
[27:26] as we honor a life and celebrate our
[27:28] life
[27:29] we thank you for the word once again we
[27:31] know lord our sister rejoice in the word
[27:33] o god
[27:34] and we pray lord that you are blessed to
[27:36] the people's heart and lord if there's
[27:38] somebody here that is seeking you lord
[27:40] i pray that you may find you lord jesus
[27:43] we cover the servants with your hands
[27:44] over everything that will be sent down
[27:46] today in the name of our lord and savior
[27:48] jesus christ
[27:50] for your glory and for your honor amen

[32:28] it's an awful sad day today but at the
[32:30] same time we are celebrating the life
[32:33] i can you marty from the time
[32:37] you were little you grew up in a place
[32:41] called greenstown
[32:42] we lived in the same street and margie
[32:46] when you look at her you know she always
[32:49] had the smile
[32:51] in fact
[33:00] [Music]
[33:26] [Music]
[33:34] [Music]
[33:36] about how much he came from

[33:42] towards the family to ask for any
[33:45] marriage
[33:46] ramesh was brought up by a single man
[33:50] so i recall the day mark even spoke to

[33:53] why don't you bring her and come home so
[33:56] we can ask
[33:57] for him and we did that so i acted as a
[34:00] brother and a friend but at the same
[34:05] in time his proposal was done and she
[34:07] was so happy
[34:09] mark is a person that curtailed a
[34:12] schooling career
[34:13] because she brought up with a very large
[34:15] family of 12 children
[34:18] and a
[34:31] the water wasn't always on tap and this
[34:34] monster had a lot of clothes
[34:36] and she still very young she could wash
[34:39] all the clothes at night
[34:41] she really gave herself to her you know
[34:43] the parents
[34:45] in the household and then she also
[34:48] learned
[34:48] her phone but in terms of the culinary
[34:50] challenge
[34:51] she could cook very well and i don't
[34:53] mind if he was a
[34:56] sample of cooking he'll always want to
[34:58] take more
[34:59] at the end of the day she always
[35:01] believed in the lord
[35:02] she believed in the lord she worshipped
[35:04] the lord there's any thanksgiving
[35:06] service that takes place
[35:08] and you know if it was most substituted
[35:12] in that service
[35:28] most of us about these conversations
[35:32] that she had she always visited my wife
[35:34] and sister veronica
[35:35] almost on a weekly basis and when i
[35:38] retired
[35:38] i managed to sit in conversations with
[35:40] them and eventually
[35:42] always
[36:10] this assurance she took the rightful
[36:13] steps to move in that direction
[36:15] and you said the steps of the righteous
[36:17] are directed by the lord
[36:18] and margie hoped in these steps she was
[36:21] a good example
[36:22] i mean to her children
[36:31] in one line she created such a sure
[36:33] foundation such a base for the children
[36:36] that you know they served a lot
[36:39] and nothing way was that she went
[36:41] through throughout the tribulations
[36:42] that she was overcomer because she took
[36:45] advice
[36:46] from the bible the scripture scripture
[36:50] and if you look at the children
[37:03] [Music]
[37:06] she was a motherly figure even my wife
[37:09] says you know
[37:10] that mahdi was a sister to her but she
[37:13] regards her as a second mother
[37:15] during you know the times so they're
[37:18] quite heartbroken but
[37:20] at the same time they have this blessed
[37:22] assurance of jesus
[37:23] the lord absolutely
[37:27] the present spirit with the lord
[37:31] i know that all of you knew her the
[37:34] words that come
[37:36] [Music]
[38:02] because
[38:12] rejoicing in the presence
[38:31] is
[38:57] jesus christ believe
[39:01] this morning we are getting the
[39:02] pleasures of the lord
[39:04] and the bible says
[39:09] i feel like to start my i won't say a
[39:13] tribute
[39:14] i say absolutely my dear
[39:17] wonderful sister the
[39:21] scripture reading is on ii corinthians
[39:23] 12
[39:24] 9 and he said unto me my grace
[39:28] is sufficient for me for my strength
[39:31] is made perfect in weakness most gladly
[39:35] therefore
[39:36] would i rather glory in my infirmities
[39:40] that the power of christ will rest upon
[39:42] me
[39:43] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[39:47] in reproaches in necessities and
[39:50] persecutions
[39:52] in distresses for christ's sake for when
[39:54] i am me
[39:56] then i am strong i believe these are the
[39:59] ones
[40:01] even when paul was alive when he looked
[40:02] upon death he said
[40:04] where is your sting oh great where
[40:09] morning i can say is same for my dear
[40:10] sister madi
[40:12] because growing up
[40:16] i always took as my dear
[40:20] sister in the lord because she was
[40:22] instrumental in me coming to know
[40:25] the lord and especially this message she
[40:28] was the one that
[40:29] especially they uh
[40:32] took me to the centers where a minister
[40:34] was teaching from america
[40:36] and they
[40:50] we had fellowship with her for two days
[40:53] two nights three nights in fact
[40:54] over the video called and someone that
[40:57] is sick
[40:58] you could see the joy of the lord she
[41:01] was actually praising god lifting her
[41:03] hands
[41:04] singing and she told me jerry
[41:08] i am not sick god has healed me
[41:11] and god has delivered me and in this
[41:14] body
[41:15] i've made my peace with god
[41:19] the last the sunday the last we had
[41:21] their service over there
[41:22] she said goodbye and i believe in my
[41:25] heart
[41:26] that my sister knew that she was foreign
[41:47] is his word and his lord brings life his
[41:49] word brings peace
[41:51] his life with joy and my sister mahdi
[41:55] adverted to the qualifications even
[41:57] before she got sick
[42:00] and she met the first time i had a
[42:03] pudding that she made this christmas
[42:06] and she gave me such a huge piece to
[42:08] take over
[42:10] and uh
[42:24] [Music]
[42:29] she loved their plants none of the
[42:31] nature
[42:32] that god puts in someone is where they
[42:35] can have the spirit
[42:36] to love nature and that was such a
[42:41] loving
[42:42] character that you know the character
[42:45] speaks louder than words you know i like
[42:47] them for god
[42:49] you don't have to preach you just have
[42:51] to know that what makes the devil a
[42:53] chamber
[42:55] for christ and i thank
[43:05] she had three daughters and these
[43:08] daughters
[43:09] were the love of her life together
[43:13] she was the foundation of that home she
[43:16] really prayed and in the services
[43:20] ramesh will be in the front of the
[43:21] teacher
[43:23] serving and praising the lord and when
[43:26] they got married
[43:28] he married two sons in fact maggie never
[43:31] regarded her son
[43:32] she took them as their sons and i'd like
[43:35] those voices marcus
[43:52] everything
[44:04] amen in fasting i'd like to say this
[44:10] brother is here you got the place that
[44:12] our jesus stays called
[44:15] the scripture says i am not seen
[44:20] entered into the yeah of man what god is
[44:24] instead of us
[44:25] so we have a blessed hope we don't look
[44:27] at the body
[44:29] because god gave us the following spirit
[44:32] but he gave us a soul
[44:34] and one thing about the soul that
[44:36] belongs to god
[44:38] and the devil can do anything the day my
[44:41] sister died
[44:42] you know there was such a beautiful
[44:43] weather it actually rained
[44:46] god blessed the earth and you know the
[44:49] blessings
[44:50] even the weather we have throughout this
[44:52] time that she
[44:53] she went on to be with the lord it's
[44:56] such a beautiful day that god has
[44:57] blessed us
[44:58] before she even left to the hospital she
[45:01] took her time
[45:02] he always takes the time anything she
[45:04] does
[45:05] she has very slowly doing anything she's
[45:08] not a person
[45:10] and she took a church she made the
[45:11] evidence late
[45:13] [Music]
[45:16] and
[45:30] this morning we are rejoicing because
[45:34] you know we can see the fruits we can
[45:36] look at what god has done
[45:38] and we can rejoice because we serve a
[45:41] god of friends
[45:42] amen you know as
[45:59] you all do everything in your power
[46:02] do everything in your power forsake
[46:05] everything
[46:06] and live for christ surrender your life
[46:08] give your heart to the lord jesus
[46:15] [Music]
[46:19] and that hope is believing his word you
[46:21] know the prophet
[46:22] our lord and savior jesus christ
[46:26] he said i wrote the word
[46:29] i am in the world and he wants us to
[46:31] believe them
[46:32] that's why the prophets think so only to
[46:34] me
[46:36] only believe all things are possible and
[46:38] i believe that
[46:40] we will see on
[46:53] but she's rejoicing holding
[47:03] amen god bless you
[47:21] i have to put on my

[2:09:04] [Music]
[2:09:10] a man i greet you once again in the
[2:09:12] precious name
[2:09:13] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[2:09:17] before i read the portion of scripture
[2:09:20] and
[2:09:21] encourage you on god's word i just like
[2:09:24] to say a few words on
[2:09:25] behalf of the fellowship son of man
[2:09:27] revealed ministries
[2:09:28] of our dear sister magi as i was saying
[2:09:31] yesterday to the family
[2:09:34] when we had a zoom memorial con
[2:09:37] meeting our sister margie was a very
[2:09:40] faithful sister
[2:09:42] she loved the lord she loved to be in
[2:09:44] fellowship
[2:09:46] she's a sister that you didn't have to
[2:09:47] foster to be in church
[2:09:49] she loved to be in fellowship with all
[2:09:51] the believers
[2:09:52] and one thing about her if she was in
[2:09:55] fellowship you will notice that she's
[2:09:57] there
[2:09:58] because she was a very vocal sister in
[2:10:00] the way she worshipped god
[2:10:02] she wasn't ashamed of who was around her
[2:10:04] whenever the worship was there she loved
[2:10:06] to praise and worship she loved to
[2:10:08] worship god she loved your aim and the
[2:10:10] word
[2:10:11] so i know today all the worship she done
[2:10:14] to her savior
[2:10:15] all the rejoicing she's done when the
[2:10:17] praise and worship was going on
[2:10:19] every time she amended that word and
[2:10:21] believed it
[2:10:22] all that she believed now she's
[2:10:24] rejoicing in it now she's reaping the
[2:10:26] benefits
[2:10:27] of what she believed she had the
[2:10:29] inheritance amen
[2:10:30] an inheritance is in christ jesus
[2:10:33] and indeed she was a
[2:10:38] a woman that you can describe the book
[2:10:39] of prophet described
[2:10:42] a woman that was faithful to a husband a
[2:10:45] woman that was
[2:10:46] true to a family a woman that raised up
[2:10:49] a children in the ways of the lord
[2:10:51] and a woman that also loved you can see
[2:10:53] so much of love in her because
[2:10:55] whenever grandchildren she brought them
[2:10:57] to church you could say the way she
[2:10:59] carries the way she carry on with the
[2:11:02] grandchildren the way she embraced them
[2:11:04] and
[2:11:04] make them sit on her and keep them with
[2:11:07] her she was always excited when they
[2:11:08] were around
[2:11:09] she loved the grandchildren she loved
[2:11:11] the children she loved the family
[2:11:13] and indeed she would be missed by all of
[2:11:15] them but we thank god that they all also
[2:11:17] believe
[2:11:19] they believe in what she believed in
[2:11:21] they we have the same blessed hope that
[2:11:22] she has amen
[2:11:24] and it won't be long as we sang that
[2:11:26] song one of these days there's going to
[2:11:28] be a resurrection
[2:11:29] that's the promise of god's word the
[2:11:31] bible says the lord himself shall
[2:11:32] descent from heaven with a shout
[2:11:35] amen and she believed the shout already
[2:11:37] which was the message that came in a day
[2:11:39] and the next thing to take place is the
[2:11:41] resurrection
[2:11:43] that's what we're waiting for that's the
[2:11:44] next event to take place
[2:11:47] because the cycle of the rapture has
[2:11:48] already begun
[2:11:50] and our sister was caught up in that
[2:11:51] cycle of the rapture already
[2:11:53] and the next event to take place is when
[2:11:56] we're gonna see
[2:11:57] our dear sister raised up again and all
[2:11:59] believers of like precious faith
[2:12:01] right down to all the seven church ages
[2:12:04] all the saints
[2:12:05] will be raised up that's the event to
[2:12:08] take place on the earth
[2:12:09] and that's the hope that this family is
[2:12:11] resting on today
[2:12:13] and as you'll hear today from the many
[2:12:15] testimonies our prayer our sister was a
[2:12:17] prayer warrior
[2:12:19] a prayer a sister that didn't always
[2:12:21] love intercession interceded for a
[2:12:22] family
[2:12:24] and i'm sure to i'm sure they will
[2:12:27] continue in that they will continue in
[2:12:29] what she has left them
[2:12:30] and molded them into as we read god's
[2:12:34] word because
[2:12:35] i believe there's no other encouragement
[2:12:36] that we can get for but god's word
[2:12:39] the bible says let every man's word be a
[2:12:41] lie but my word be the truth
[2:12:44] amen the bible in first corinthians
[2:12:46] chapter 15
[2:12:48] reading from verse 12 it says now if
[2:12:51] christ be preached
[2:12:53] that he rose from the dead how say some
[2:12:56] among you
[2:12:57] that there is no resurrection after the
[2:12:59] dead
[2:13:01] but if there be no resurrection of the
[2:13:04] dead
[2:13:05] then is christ not risen and if christ
[2:13:08] be not risen
[2:13:10] then is our preaching vain and your
[2:13:12] faith
[2:13:13] also vain yay and we found
[2:13:16] false witnesses of god because
[2:13:20] we have testified of god that he raised
[2:13:23] up
[2:13:23] christ whom he raised not up
[2:13:27] if so be that the dead rise not for if
[2:13:30] the dead rise not
[2:13:32] then is not christ raised and if christ
[2:13:35] be not raised
[2:13:36] your faith is in vain yea
[2:13:40] yet in your sins then they also which
[2:13:43] are fallen asleep
[2:13:44] in christ are perished if in this life
[2:13:48] only we have opened christ we
[2:13:52] are of all men most miserable but now
[2:13:56] is christ risen from the dead and become
[2:13:59] the first fruits of them that slept
[2:14:02] for sins by man came dead by man also
[2:14:06] the resurrection of the dead for as in
[2:14:08] the
[2:14:09] in adam all die even so in christ
[2:14:13] shall all be made alive but every man in
[2:14:16] his own order
[2:14:18] christ the first fruits afterward they
[2:14:21] are christ at his coming then come at
[2:14:24] the end
[2:14:24] when he shall have devil delivered up
[2:14:26] the kingdom to god
[2:14:28] even the father when he shall have put
[2:14:30] down all rule and all authority and
[2:14:32] power
[2:14:33] for we must reign till he had put all
[2:14:35] enemies under his feet
[2:14:37] the last enemy that shall be destroyed
[2:14:40] is dead for he had put all things under
[2:14:44] his feet
[2:14:45] but when he said all things are put
[2:14:47] under him it is manifest that he
[2:14:49] expect accepted which did put all things
[2:14:53] under him and when all things shall be
[2:14:55] subdued unto him
[2:14:57] then shall the son also himself be
[2:14:59] subject unto him
[2:15:01] that put all things under him that god
[2:15:03] may be
[2:15:04] in all else what shall they do
[2:15:07] which are baptized for the dead if the
[2:15:09] dead rise not at all
[2:15:11] why are they then baptized for the dead
[2:15:14] amen we thank god that we have a
[2:15:17] revelation that christ
[2:15:18] is risen from the dead and for the past
[2:15:20] 2000 years we've seen the power
[2:15:22] of the resurrection of jesus christ and
[2:15:25] one day at lazarus tomb
[2:15:27] when jesus raised lazarus from the dead
[2:15:30] he said marvel lot is this
[2:15:32] one of these days all his graves shall
[2:15:34] be opened up
[2:15:37] one of these days not only in the days
[2:15:40] of lazarus
[2:15:41] he had to mention lazarus name and said
[2:15:43] lazarus comfort
[2:15:44] if he just said come forth he was the
[2:15:46] power of the resurrection
[2:15:48] he was the resurrection and the life the
[2:15:50] whole graves would have opened up
[2:15:51] but he said lazarus come forth but one
[2:15:54] of these days
[2:15:55] all these graves of believers of like
[2:15:58] precious fate
[2:15:59] is going to be opened up oh and say now
[2:16:02] we can say
[2:16:03] oh death where is your sting oh grave
[2:16:06] where is your victory for those that are
[2:16:09] died in christ that corruption will put
[2:16:11] on incorruption
[2:16:12] that's the promise we have in god's word
[2:16:15] and that's why we have a hope and sorrow
[2:16:17] not like those who don't believe
[2:16:19] for we know that the dead in christ
[2:16:20] shall rise first
[2:16:22] amen we're going to pray now and we're
[2:16:25] going to open the
[2:16:26] open the casket for viewing and we
[2:16:30] we ask that first we'll allow the
[2:16:32] immediate family to view
[2:16:34] then we'll ask those that didn't have a
[2:16:36] chance to view and then one more
[2:16:37] one last time we'll open again for the
[2:16:39] immediate family we can ask our brother
[2:16:41] adrian to pray
