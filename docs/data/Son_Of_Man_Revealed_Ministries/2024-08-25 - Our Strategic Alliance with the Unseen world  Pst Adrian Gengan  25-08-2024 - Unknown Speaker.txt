amen everybody feeling good in the house of the Lord amen hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen I'm glad to see my uncle amen wlly amen let's give him a hand David amen I don't know the sisters that's sitting next to him what's her name amen but the Lord bless you amen good to see you I pray you be blessed in the presence of the Lord amen hallelujah how many of you can see the spirit of God moving amen with Mighty signs Miracles and wonders amen and how is that coming out through the revelation of the word we are using the word amen as our basis because there's no prophetic gift on the earth now so we can't go to a prophet for visions and and all of those things amen but the word is the absolute the prophet teaches us that gifts are secondary things but the Bible is the principal theme amen the Bible is the absolute if we can apply the word by faith we must see the same results amen so we are thankful amen hallelujah for what the Lord is doing in our lives amen and all of his movings amongst the Church of God Amen praise the Lord amen you appreciate the song I enjoy that song Adore amen hallelujah thank you at Le I know I'm next in line who she adors praise the Lord but that was sung beautifully this morning we pray the Lord will continue to bless us to car amen hallelujah let's turn to our Bibles this morning praise the Lord we're continuing with our thought we were dealing with adoption amen amen we were dealing with so many aspects of adoption showing you how even in the message of the hour you can remain a son and not go on to adoption amen and adoption requires certain things to be in place and we showed you how you need to be put under a guide under a teacher that's what the Hebrews did amen they put the son under a tutor and a guide and we know the guide that was sent to us was the great holy spirit amen amen hallelujah and we showed you that this every teacher must have a syllabus and that syllabus was conduct order and the doctrine that the prophet reestablished in the church C because that's when he's coming to give an account to the father now he must base you on something so the conduct order and Doctrine is what he's going to give a report to the father about amen hallelujah and we were showing you heart that when a son is now position placed he now possesses all the authority of the father so that he can go out now oh yes and enlarge his territory amen therefore the spirit took us into this realm now once you come into adoption you've got to open up spiritual Frontiers amen for the kingdom of God we must Advance the kingdom of God at this time so this morning I'll speak on the opening of of spiritual Frontiers and our strategic alliance with the Unseen World amen every Army that goes out into battle must form strategic alliances and we are formed an alliance with the Unseen World amen so I want you to know that the Unseen World is more real yes amen than what we contact with these five senses hallelujah amen and how do we connect with that Unseen World Faith connects us to that unseen spiritual realm the Heavenly places the high dimensions of the Holy Ghost amen so we'll turn to 1 Chronicles chap 4 this is where we initially got our inspiration from I just want to read that as a backing 1 Chronicles chapter 4 and we'll read from verse 9 now what we are reading is jabz and jabz is coming from the tribe of Judah Hallelujah jabz was a son of Judah a descendant of Judah and Jaz was more honorable than his Brethren and his mother called him is nam jabz now pay attention to that because what we are taught is that the Hebrew mothers in giving child birth they would call the name of the son everybody remember the prophet teaching us there they would call the name of the son in child birth and according to how the mother called a name when Joshua was placing them in the land he placed them in the right right place amen so each one was going to get a portion of the inheritance hallelujah amen and his mother called his name jabz saying because I bear him with sorrow and jabz called on the god of Israel saying oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed and enlarge my Coast yes that's my border my territory and that thine hand might be with me and thou wouldest Keep Me From Evil amen that it may not grieve me and God granted him that which he requested amen amen our heavenly father amen we'll get back to that now I want to go to 2 Kings chapter 6 verse1 15 amen our strategic alliance with the Unseen World 2 Kings chapter 6 and verse1 15 and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold an host Compass the city both with horses and chariots yes physical horses and chariots now when do they come in the night time Satan will always try and work in darkness to take you unawares so when they awoke early in the morning they see the city surrounded with chariots horses and chariots and his servant said unto him this is now talking to Elisha alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them amen amen but physically if you're looking with the five senses you can't see this all you see you are surrounded and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see I want him to see what I am seeing amen but we thank God we've had a the amen the fourth Elijah year that took us into that spiritual realm so that we can see what he saw the opening up of spiritual Frontiers for us amen and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha amen thank you Lord and when they came down to him Elisha prayed unto the Lord and said Smite these people I pray thee with blindness and he smoke them with blindness according to the word of Elisha amen hallelujah one more uh maybe just few more portions we're going to read here I just want to get to it Genesis 32 And1 you can be seated amen we'll continue to read Hallelujah Genesis 32 And1 Jacob is on his way now to find him his mother told him and his father told him to go and take a wife from his own people so Jacob is on his way but I want you to notice something this is before he meets the angel on the ladder before he wrestles with the angel his first encounter Genesis 32 And1 and Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him amen and when Jacob saw them he said this is God's host amen amen this is Who David was talking about am amen you defile the armies of the Living God yes he wasn't concentrating on the the the Philistines that were shaking in their boots but gol was defying the armies of the Living God this is the house that he's talking about Jacob met this Host this is God's host amen Joshua 5:13 I'm laying the scriptures down you can make note of it and ponder it I'm trying to show you there's an Unseen [Music] World amen hallelujah and we are not going to amen be able to fight the battles on our own yes in the flesh there's got to be a strategic Alliance to connect with the Unseen World amen and I'm happy to announce that the message of the hour came to connect us with the Unseen World Joshua 5:3 and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with a sword dra drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him at thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as the captain of the host of the Lord am I now come amen so the host said Jacob M has a captain and it's the Lord himself amen amen he's the captain of the host and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and he said unto him what sayth my Lord unto his son servant and the captain of the Lord's old said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou stand us is Holy and Joshua did so amen now Joshua would have known that Moses had the same encounter the same Angel of the Lord that was in the burning bush one more portion of scripture here in Acts chapter 27 coming to the New Testament Paul is now on a ship the ship he's heading to be Shipwrecked there's a storm on the sea and I want you to notice that Paul spoke to them and told them amen that they shouldn't have loosed from a certain city but they didn't listen to him so he gave them a prophetic word and they didn't listen and notice this part but after long absence abstinence Paul stood in the midst of them so Paul went into a time of consecration amen he abstained himself stood in forth in the midst of them and said s you should have arken unto me and not have lose from creit and to have gained this arm and loss and now I exal you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship why for they stood by me this night the angel of God Amen who I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God had given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore s be of good cheer for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me amen praise the Lord the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word amen amen so just reading those scriptures alone will make us see that there's definitely an Unseen World yes amen praise the Lord yes amen to go back to our opening scripture and just put some remarks there here is jaes and every son every son of Jacob had an inheritance the 12 tribes were camped in the land everybody agree amen everyone was given a portion of inheritance and I want you to know that jabz was given a portion of inheritance but jabz was not a lazy man jabz was given a small portion of territory and I want you to know Jaz was not being envious of other people's inheritance neither was he looking with lust yes amen because God doesn't reward the lazy yes God rewards those who put their hands to work amen and he will bless the works of the hand so I believe jabz worked every inch of ground hallelujah amen if he was given this land here he walked every inch of ground he walked it into the borders yes amen until he said Lord I have potential oh yes I am a man of vision amen Lord won't you enlarge my territory amen yes Lord give me a greater portion amen amen hallelujah I'm telling you don't be satisfied with a portion that's been allotted to you the message of the hour has come amen so that you can advance the kingdom of God you can open up spiritual territories in your own life don't be satisfied with your present spiritual condition amen amen you can open up spiritual Frontiers even in your own life amen there is more of God that we can yes sir take in we if we empty out ourselves there's more of the Holy Spirit yes Lord amen so jabz must have walked every inch of ground until he had a dream and a vision in the back part of his mind and he said this portion that I have now I can't fulfill what's in my mind but Lord if you enlarge my territory oh yes amen I'm asking you to be a man of vision to be a woman of vision oh yes amen God can en your territory amen hallelujah God can enlarge your portion oh yes and he didn't only say that he said you would bless me indeed enlarge my coast and that thine hand might be with me you see if you if you grew up a certain way maybe you came up in a certain household you don't have to remain that way oh yes amen God has given you the potential to put your hand to work God don't call the LA Hallelujah when God called his 12 disciples Peter was a fisherman Andrew was a fisherman the amen Matthew was a tax collector God calls those that are at work already people who are not lazy people they can use in his kingdom yes Amen in fact matter of fact Jesus saw one time he's talking about a parable here and he's telling that he saw some people laying Idol Jesus don't like idle people Amen in the 11th hour he told them why don't you also go work in the field why are you standing your Idol Hallelujah maybe it's a closing scenes of the Gentile dispensation and you haven't put your to the plow I'm ask you don't stand idle in the kingdom of God get to work amen for the kingdom of God Amen and Jesus rewards you when you put your hand to work because they receive the same reward as the one who went in the first hour of the day yes amen hallelujah am so God rewards it in fact when he created his first son Adam he put him in a garden before he gave him a wife he told him to work the garden amen amen so God wants us to be accountable in fact that's a principle in God's kingdom the one to whom he gave talents he rewarded those that went and invested it and worked it and brought a return back amen Jesus even took from one and he gave to the one that had a higher return and the one that hid it in the ground the one that did nothing with it Jesus said you are cast out of the Kingdom amen praise the Lord so I'm asking you this which narative of the message of the hour that we have in the form of the opening of the word what are we doing with it are we bringing multiplication to it are we enlarging our territories with it or are we using it for knowledge are we using it to say we are part of the message we are saved no God has called us into a battle God has called us into a fight in this hour amen it's a great Showdown it's the Mount Zion Showdown hallelujah praise the Lord amen now in this Unseen World in this unseen realm there exist things that this eye can't see if we read the second Kings chapter 6 you'll see how did men design chariots because they were spiritual chariots in God's kingdom God has horses in his kingdom amen yes right now don't be like the man who was trying to dispute with the prophet now and say h there was no there's no horses in heaven right because he took him through the Bible and he showed him amen he took him to this scripture as well he even wrote him a letter he said I'm surprised a man of your fine standing would be ignorant in these things the prophet tells us what letter he wrote to him and he says in the book of Kings they are chariots that you and I can't see amen hallelujah they are horses yeah that you and I can't see and I don't many if you know that horses and chariots are for are for transportation so somebody is riding that horse and chariots amen oh yes yes it's an Angelic host he says all around this building right now even here along these aisles and the shares and everything there's Angelic beings right here now to connect with your faith praise the Lord amen amen so in the Kingdom of God in this Unseen World they are angels they are chariots You Are Not Alone everywhere you go you are not alone if you're a son and daughter of God position now for the adoption You Are Not Alone angels are ministering Spirits Hebrews 4 Says angels are ministering spirits to the hirs of Salvation amen amen Angels Have Always Been Messengers that carry messenges from the Heavenly realm and brings it to the Earth can you say Amen to that amen amen you are not to bow down to Angels you are not to worship angels angels are here to serve you the prophet of God says sons are higher than Serv and he says angels and servants and Sons and Daughters of God hold a higher rank and Authority amen yes praise the Lord amen in fact you would get excited if you see an angel right now but I want you to know the angels are excited to be in the presence of a son and a daughter of God somebody give God praise come on now we can't be in a backing condition amen we've got to know what the scripture says about us we've got to know our position how can we be HS of the fathers joint ears with the son children of his kingdom and we think that angels are higher than us no you hold Authority you owe power in fact on the earth now you hold the word of God Amen you because you were given dominion over the Earth Psalm 115 says amen the heavens belong to the Lord but the Earth as he given to Children of Men yes amen God won't do anything on the Earth except he connects with a man you tell me it's not so show me in the Bible God did something on the earth without connecting with a man on the earth he connected with Abraham he connected with Enoch he connected with Noah he connected amen with every son and daughter of God so if God's going to do anything in this hour he's got to connect with a son and daughter of God because man has the legal Authority on the earth amen praise the Lord we've been through all of this amen I'm just preaching it now amen hallelujah so we find here if we if we starting out we can see here that Adam had close fellowship with God and there can be no higher Unseen World than the realm of God the highest Authority in the Unseen realm is God Almighty so he had fellowship with this Unseen World I'm afraid that in our natural life this is not taught to us from birth Because by the time we come to the age of accountability we are already in school learning other things yeah but we are not taught son daughter you may exist in this life with your five senses and you're contacting through sight through hearing through touching to feeling but there's an Unseen World all around us there's God and the angels of God that are here not only are the the angels that have not Fallen but they are also fallen angels that will try to influence you that's right this needs to be taught to our young people people yes this needs to be taught to us more what I'm trying to do now is trying to iten our sins amen try to iten our sensitivity to the spirit realm amen because we walk not after the flesh but we walk after the spirit that can't just be a saying amen that just can't be a Bible verse that we repeat we must be walking after the spirit because sons of God are led by the spirit of God hallelujah so hadam had close Fellowship he had a close association with God and the Angelic world just because you don't read things in the Bible doesn't mean it isn't so amen angels are messengers from God carrying word back and forth amen it can't be that fallen so if you're saying it's not so I'm going to prove you wrong right now how come in the Garden of Eden the fallen angels can speak to Eve you accept the fact that fallen angels can speak to Eve can possess the serpent and try and influence him how about the angels of God amen amen amen praise the Lord so it can't be that fallen angels can walk in the serpent yet angel that stood with Michael and resisted the lies of the enemy could not be in contact with Adam the angel of God because why the Psalms tell us the angel of God encamped around them that fear Him amen and he will deliver them amen and I believe the man who feared God the most was Adam so the angel of the Lord had to be with him praise the Lord let's just get our first quote there and see what the prophet of God is saying I'll show you now what the prophet is saying and then you can maybe believe me Hallelujah I want you to know even right now you are being influenced from two Realms in the Unseen World right now there's a demonic influence trying to influence you but there's a spirit of God also trying to pull you amen so you decide whose side you want to be on this morning amen if you're on God's side you say Amen to the word of God don't let any Spirits hang around you amen you know what the prophet of God says about spirits hanging around they may not be in you but they hang around you they stifle your praise they stifle your worship he says when God raised up spread from his hands and made the world and created the heavens and earth and made man done all things in his great plan of miraculous the life of God was in man amen hallelujah amen amen man believed in the Supernatural yes but sin separated him so Man became unconscious of the supernatural world Amen israels as it was got clogged up right to stop the flow of the supernatural after the fall there come a time now this is the next quote in conference with God watch now I'm going to prove my point about angels being in the Garden of Eden there come a time in God's Great economy where there had to be a Conference held and the first one that I can call off for this Earth was in the Garden of Eden when the angels of God came home weeping saying your child has fallen they were carrying report back to the father yeah your child has fallen he sinned he's broken your commandment something has to be done the creature of God has fallen from grace and was subject unto Eternal separation from the presence of his God and His maker so my point is from the beginning of time man has always had an encounter with the Unseen World yes yes in fact Adam was a man who operated with six senses amen yes amen he was a man of Faith amen hallelujah the reason why he was amen able to operate like a god man on the earth he was operating through the realm of Faith amen amen faith is the master of all circumstances therefore he could speak to the mountain amen he could speak to the trees he could speak to the winds that was Adam's greatest sense yeah more than the natural senses praise the Lord amen so we are finding here there was contact and as we approaching the end of the Gentile dispensation how many of you believe we approaching now amen all things are fixed right now amen every government is in place amen demon powers are in place religions are in place amen and the Bride of Jesus Christ is in a place yes amen so as we approaching the end of the Gentile dispensation we should becoming more aware and connected with the supernal world Amen with the Anan world this ought to be evident in our daily lives amen I want to heighten your senses this morning and make you walk after the spirit and not after the flesh because in the flesh there's condemnation of sin but Romans tells us that there's no condemnation to those who walk after the spirit amen and not after the flesh yes amen praise the Lord so we are coming more aware more connected with the Unseen World we know how to connect with them we know how to amen move ahead we know how to conquer territories we know amen how to commission praise the Lord now this is going to take Revelation 10:11 now because under your prophecies is how you operating yeah yeah it's under your prophesy again thou must prophesy again that you are able now to take control of the spiritual realm ah come on now your prophecy is just not a casual prophecy right your prophecy is a God man back on the earth you got titled deep back on the earth you are able to speak to the seen world and the Unseen World amen praise the lord we know what we're talking about right amen amen just the last week you see how God raised up Moses Chetty amen Tak him from the gates of death you've seen how God touches to Victory amen sister Victory here let's give the Lord a good ank of Praise amen they said she had a heart attack amen they were doing further test amen probably have admitted her and done some work on her but then the Unseen World came into Play Hallelujah yes praise the Lord you are brother Caleb some of you want your wedes day brother Caleb's testimony he's sitting in the service while the songs being sung and he can't he can't praise the Lord because he's got a problem he can't worship and while the preaching amen he's testimony now while the preaching is going forth yes Lord the word of God says you can ask speak now amen praise the Lord and he says while Peter yet speak now he's applying the scripture while Peter yet spake oh yes he says while the preaching was going on I said speak now and he said he spoke and that thing left him immediately amen praise the Lord amen what is that the supernatural presence of God yes Lord amen we're not here to play amen we're not here to play Church we're here to prepare people for the rapture we are here to take Sons and Daughters of God and put them in an adoption ceremony amen hallelujah amen so our sensors must be item at this time we've got to understand how Angels work we've got to understand how the Angelic World works how the supernatural World Works how to tear down demon powers yes amen you've got to be a master killing demons amen oh yes Lord yes Lord you've got to be a master binding them and casting them out amen praise the Lord so our fight is not our fight is not without spiritual Supernatural assistance is what I'm trying to tell you Heavenly beings have come down to connect with sons of God and that's how what activates Romans 8:19 the manifestation of the sons of God so I say we have been sensitized to this natural life and we have been desensitized to the supernatural world Amen Hallelujah so sons of God like we saying let's go to the next quote now I want to show you this because in each and every one of our Lives we've got to look for this the prophet of God said it I believe it amen and that settles it yes you can tell me that an angel won't come to you I'm believing that an angel will come to you yes amen he says when when a man proves and God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself there in the front of angels he does something for him he lifts him up there in the presence of God and gives him and fills him and sets him out amen that's the age that we are living in amen amen yes amen remember for your adoption ceremony now it has to be in a public place sir Hallelujah he's going to put his robe his word on you yes he's going to give you the authority the same signing Powers as the father he says you can fire who you fire hire who you hire all authority is given to you when you're an adopted son that was in the message what was the Holy Ghost given for now in the message he you him watch now very important he's talking about Jesus and I'm just doing this for those of you that don't know how Jesus adoption ceremony was you see Jesus had proven to God that he'd been the right kind of son and God took him up on top of the mountain brought Witnesses out there Heavenly Witnesses and Earthly Witnesses and he clothe him in immortality yes yes yes when they looked up they said his garments shined like the sun a supernatural something taking place his garments glisten like the sun in its middle of this day as white as it could be God placed on him that robe of immortality showing that he had received him now you know what happened in the woods it just connected now amen you know the prophet turned young in the woods he says the deer came ate from his hand amen that just connected now that's the reason why God was putting the robe of immortality on the prophet am showing that he had received him oh that's powerful that's the thing that God will do to his sons I pay everyone's listening to this now listen to what he's saying that's the thing God will do to his sons here on Earth someday yes amen right he will call you a son church if you'll only obey him now wasn't that the word beginning of the year if you follow the instruction you shall see the glory of God and what we've learned through the month is the glory is in the Shak the glory is in the holiest of holies that's where the adoption ceremony takes place so if you follow if you obey him and stay on the word and believe it he will place you into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ amen ah some people don't want to surrender to the Lord amen they're saying oh Lord one day you'll come and you'll adopt me what is he saying here before the coming hello am come on now let me prove it to you amen Jesus got filled with the spirit at the Jordan yeah that we can call his birth right because we know the Holy Spirit comes for two things according to the prophet he comes to birth you and then he comes for the adoption ceremony amen so Jesus at the Jordan we can call that the birth amen then in Matthew chap 17 it his adoption ceremony but was that before Jesus died and rose again yes it was before Jesus died and rose again before he came back in a glorified body so I am telling you this is going to happen to you amen before Jesus comes according to this quote am oh somebody connect now come on amen if you don't believe it say Lord bring that to pass in my life amen he will call you aside if you'll obey him stay on the word believe it and he will place you into it into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ he will place into the church all the powers that Christ had in him will be in the church somebody receive all the powers that Christ had will be in the church Hallelujah all that God was he pour into Jesus all that Jesus Jesus was he PS into the church God wanting his work done he sent it into the Son and the son wanting the work done sent into the church so he quotes his scripture there and I'm going to take it from 38 now he says placing of a son pay attention to this now I'm giving you the second quote where he's going to place you before Angels take him out into a certain place have a ceremony before angels and place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ Christ amen amen then that person has the authority oh yes some of you are being placed right now amen in the presence of angels right now you are being placed in your position because there's nothing can place you better than the word than what I'm preaching to you right now teaching places you doesn't that Prophet teaches that thank you Lord hallelujah amen see what the prophet of God says and the angels of God are standing in the aisles tonight then they are here and the great Holy Spirit moving up and down the aisles see Unseen World the people are aware that you're here father I pray you will heal everyone through Jesus name he says we realize that opposition stands close you see what he's saying Satan is close right now demon powers are close right now why they want to take the word away from you yeah Satan is Raging unbelief is trying to settle it upon the in upon the people yet the angels are at their position what are they doing the same Angels when the word was coming to Daniel demon powers were stopping the word from coming to Daniel yes so they formed a resistance so now when Satan is trying to whisp in your ear right now the angels are here you believe that amen allowing the word to come through they're fighting off every unbelief right now amen Angel Powers at work right now amen you're trying to get trying to distract you but the spirit of God is saying Focus he says they're standing ready even the white flags of heaven will wave in Victory you see yeah I'm going to prove to what I just said now where the Prophet is saying he says the only thing I can do is cast to it doubt from your heart I don't know that I can do that I'll try by prayer and if the doubt leaves you and you feel that there's something near you the angels of God are in the building you say is that so preacher yes absolutely the Bible says the angels of God are encamp about those that fear Him listen to this but there's a dark shadow between you and that angel that wants to help you Lord you see why I say we've been lifted into the spiritual realm to see these things through a prophetic gift yes so there's a dark shadow we set Spirit hanging over you Dark Shadow between you and that angel that wants to help you bringing the message of Christ that's unbelief now if you can get that unbelief that dark shadow then you'll see plainly then you'll raise your hand and rejoice ah now if I don't see you raising your hand and rejoicing I know there's a dark spirit I know there's a dark shadow he's a prophet confirming that he says if you can get that dark Spirit out the way then you'll raise and rejoice and go home shouting praising God and get well don't let that shadow stand between you amen amen in fact even right now I bind and I break that spirit amen there's a resisting Spirit here right now and I break and I bind that spirit in Jesus name thank you Jesus amen Satan's going to let you go amen hallelujah if you a son and daughter of God you must be free right now you must be delivered right now you must be liberated right now I am free somebody say I am free I am free I free amen you are free from depression you are free from sickness you are free from anxiety you are free from worry you are free from depression you are free from every oppression say I am free in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord amen demon power is trying to hold you bound but I free you in Jesus name I am sounding the Jubilee Trumper this morning I'm Waging War With the Enemy for your freedom somebody praise God huah Hallelujah yes Lord amen thank you Father amen thank you Lord amen Let Freedom Reign thank come on Let Freedom Reign let his presence be here now amen we haven't just come for religious gathering we have come for connection to connect in a strategic alliance with the Angelic world thank you Lord praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah the message doesn't come to make us de theologians but it's come to put the life in the church yes Lord thank you Jesus praise the Lord yeah now what Angelic beings do as well God always sends Angelic beings to one the world I believe there's Angelic beings in the Earth today are wanting the world of judgment to come before the destruction of Sodom and gomorra which is a perfect thing of today oh if you watch the Democratic party it's like the part of demon powers they are fixing to rise on the scene in fact they in power now under Revelation 13 but they can't make a move because the angel got his hand his foot on this head on the feet on the land and on the sea but they are in place notice Revelation 10 he descends with one foot on land one foot on sea Revelation 13 the Beast is rising out of land and the Beast is rising out of the sea so the angel comes to suppress these two two Powers because he's got his people on the Earth amen that must go and take the book from the Angel's hand right that's for the Gentiles for the Jews he's got the Four Angels in Revelation 7 holding back the winds amen yes so that's why they want to take out Israel but they can't take out Israel Putin wants to start World War III but something is holding him back he wants to press a button amen you know Russia the the uh symbol is the bear and now you got Ukraine like a small little mouse going stoking the bear poking him what's going to happen one day you keep poking the bear the bear is going to awaken but that can only happen when the bride leaves the Earth so right now they you know they all want to kill one another but they can't do it because four angels are holding back the winds winds mean Wars and strife the prophet says and then there's the mighty Angel standing with foot on land and sea suppressing the Beast and suppressing the Pope the pope is thinking I've got all world religions to sign the final document they're all in alignment but I can't make a move what's happening I want the pope to look up he'll see a foot on his head amen the Angel's foot is on his head thankes praise the Lord he says here now so Angel's ey warning that's what the point is God sent Angels down there to call lot out look just before the coming of the righteous one the great Son of God God sent an angel down and that angel came to a home that was a respected home he says if you want angels to visit your home be like zachariah's home him and sarrow is Li living upright before the Lord keeping all the statutes all the Commandments of the Lord living in perfect obedience to the Lord in the light that they had and the Commandment and zacharias's office was to wave incense so he's saying you be a priest that's what he's trying to tell you wave incense burning incense at the altar while the people were praying and while he was waving the incense standing on the right hand side of the altar stood Gabriel the great Archangel now in unchangeable word he says you can't walk with the world and expect God to walk with you Hallelujah remember that amen you hold to God's standard you hold to his word am the the Bible says there's a Time For Everything Under the Sun you don't need to jump ahead and do things you wait for God's time and season amen Angels won't visit you on nothing else but the world because you cannot mix God and the world together they will not mix God's holy separated from the world see what kind of a home the a angel comes to a home that keeps the Commandment of God a home that people that walks upright before God if you want the honor of an Angel visiting your home have a home ready for him to visit hallelujah amen prepared and ready under the blood of the Lamb the angels of the Lord come to such places amen didn't he come to you brother Joshua sister venessa last year there they they created the right atmosphere brother Joshua had the nerve problem amen amen after the family altar the angel saw the atmosphere was right amen sister Vanessa if you know she's not somebody who goes around bashing scriptures around you know what I mean saying her yeah he he praise the Lord I'm a right sister Venice amen she's a quiet sister who want to go and do things like that generally it's in her nature maybe but after the prayer she called brother Joshua and she said you've been complaining I don't know your exact words I'm paraphrasing says let me pray for you we've been complaining with that problem she said a simple prayer brother Joshua recognized something was different he received it right there and he's never had an episode since then give God praise amen what is it the Angel is coming into your home amen praise the Lord in the message the time of decision he says it's later than you think what decision will you make now when you see his Angel moving see the message come Jesus is coming soon the angel of God is here on Earth going before the servants performing signs and wonders have you seen it just like Jesus said he would do and is's here now Hallelujah now watch what happens when the preaching of the word Goes Forth the prophet's going to take you into the spiritual realm now and open up a frontier to you he says now we can preach the word explain the word but you have to receive the word but there's a there's something happens when the word is preached and you receive it it causes an explosion of Faith watch what he says that's what sets it a fire brother amen it causes an explosion amen amen when you can receive the word with faith amen Lord when you receive it the Revelation watch something slips out of the Unseen World Yonder comes rolling down through the mystical Channel somewhere into your soul amen amen there's a defining exchange the preaching of the word and the receiving of the word brings down the Unseen World into your soul is that the profet of God Amen a Divine exchange now I see your eyes brighten your lips are H low straighten up and smile every muscle in your body seems to Rejoice amen hallelujah he says when the our intellectual faith comes down into our heart so it must drop from the head to the heart and become so charged with the Unseen World that every word of God becomes a positive truth I'm a firm believer in positivity negativity breathes negativity you hang around negative people you be negative but the word of God is positive faith is positive Faith looks to the Unseen amen amen thank you Lord very important quote we're going to now Mark this down if you can it's in the message Revelation book of symbols he says Angelic beings associate together and if you've got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural how many of you I I candidate amen amen you got the Holy Ghost you're a candidate for Association amen for the Unseen World and the supernatural when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly you become a two-fold being so I'm looking at a two-fold being right now amen hallelujah if you got the Holy Ghost I'm looking at a twofold being you see I'm revealing things to you about yourself through the prophetic realm right now so don't just live a kind of Life thinking that you are an insignificant nobody you're a two-fold being yes thank you Lord he says one of the earth to die maybe with old age right or sickness and one of Heaven to live in this body he's still subject to death but in his soul Oh Glory he's pass from Death unto life amen yes in his body he has his Earthly contact with his five senses you know what five senses are see taste feel smell and hear he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost oh yes that's our connection with the Unseen realm the Holy Ghost amen and the angels of God visits them speaks with them amen why you can't change that why you don't write there the angel of God visits Malachi 4 only speaks with him and he's a messenger from God hallelujah you want to change your quote or you want to leave it the way it is he says if you got the Holy Ghost the angels of God visit them speaks to them and they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring Messengers from God to the individual he says Daniel couldn't talk perhaps face to face with God but God sent an angel as an intermediate between him and God that he could talk between them Angel the very word angel means messenger he says if a boy was at the door knock at the door and told you I have a telegram for you Mr so and so he would be a messenger or an Earthly Angel he said is your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church Messenger to the church therefore a pastor should never leave that word but stay straight with the word amen because he's feeding the shepherd's place the pastor means Shepherd look it up and find if it ain't right the pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer of his certain flock to feed them with what the word of God amen amen I'm going to close now amen it's 11:2 3 so I got just s minutes all we need is seven Church ages and then it's finished right because the seventh from Adam was Enoch and Enoch left a pyramid of who he was yes sir at the end of the seventh Church age we are building a pyramid City right now Hallelujah you know the city that came down from heaven John saw it was actually the city that went up amen that's right statue of a perfect man right building a pyramid City then he takes it in a Rapture and John sees that same pyramid City coming down amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen now wouldn't you like to live where you're conscious this is what I'm trying to tell you heighten your senses wouldn't you like to live where you're conscious that the Unseen World Is Right with you all the time you see sister L the Unseen World was with you in your accident you even testified to it amen she even testified that that bump was not an ordinary bump that the car behind her said they didn't bump her but somebody bumped her amen who bumped out the way oh yes come on now oh yes amen hallelujah the prophet of God says you're bumping into Angels Hallelujah am he says so he's asking a question wouldn't you like to live where your conscience conscious that the Unseen World Is Right with you all the time to realize when you walk out here and get in your car Angels take the position by the side of you right that's right amen when you walk up yonder to that man so unlovely to you that's the holy spirit is standing right above you and angels all around you amen he quotes the scripture again the angels of God are encamped around them that fear Him He says they don't go back to Heaven they Camp there oh thank you Lord so when you wake up in the night you can ask the angel are you still camping here you better be camping here because me I have the fear of the Lord amen hello amen yeah go read Hebrews 4 angels are ministering Spirits sent to the ears of Salvation well who's the ears of Salvation so angels are ministering spirits to you they encamp around you they here for your protection from from demonic attack don't tell me that demons are attacking you then you've left his presence Hallelujah yes he says they don't go back to Heaven they Camp there they sent on missions to watch you through life's journey Hallelujah through life's journey all through life's journey Hallelujah till I take my last breath they are here to watch youj to protect you he says Jesus is here his spirit is here what happened just now listen to the prophet he said I went into another world it's an Unseen World we become so conscious of looking at one another like this but but there's an Unseen World it's greater than anything you can see and he is Christ in this world in this building here are evil spirits and War and Christians anointed amen amen and the angels of God en camper about them trying to energize them with faith is that's what's happening this morning trying to energize you with faith thank you Lord thank you Lord and here I am standing here just healing myself and the Holy Spirit are move and this is what you call Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this is what you call higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost Lord and remember Satan always skeptic Skeptics are sons of God you know he always does that someone with a skeptic idea when they do that just is trying to interfere but Christians always overcome amen somebody say I'm an overcomer amen I'm an overcomer amen praise the Lord now now this is very important you watch you notice the prophet of God also says watch when the spirit of God is moving you'll try and be restless now with the children or try and do this because you got to know the presence of God Is Right Here Right Now yes amen yes I can tell you things that happen in your life right now right amen hallelujah I can tell you that you were drawn to church straight because of certain instances certain circumstances and certain words being spoken that's the power of God right now amen so watch very important quote now because this church I believe have have entered into this realm right amen I think any man or woman boy or girl and I think in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth can never can have a full Foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word into reality how many if you can say you've met that light that brings the word into reality and the next part is very important I think no church in its practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it may might be that church cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is made known among the people and they see it I'm asking you have you seen it can you give testimony to it yes Lord thank J something they can talk to that will talk back to them that vindicates this written word now watch in the next quote I want to read this part this part here he's talking about Rebecca and he says I'm trying to show you the Lord goes before you the angel of God and it was in the evening time he came to the well and it was about that time that Rebecca had to make a decision I believe the angel the L Angel of the Lord beat him there about half an hour right important quote but I like the next part for he will send his angels before you then makes the way clear thank you Lord so when you leave your home say father I thank you Lord that youve
