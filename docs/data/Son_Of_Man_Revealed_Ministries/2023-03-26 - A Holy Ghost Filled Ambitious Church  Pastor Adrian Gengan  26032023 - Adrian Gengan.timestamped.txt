[8:52] protection over their lives
[8:54] amen and we know it was the angel of God
[8:56] protecting them amen so let's stand this
[8:58] morning for the reading of his word
[9:01] amen let's turn to Colossians chapter 3
[9:04] and verse
[9:05] verse one to four
[9:08] Colossians chapter 3 1-4 says since then
[9:12] you have been raised with Christ
[9:17] this morning it says since then Europe
[9:20] is worth Christ said
[9:23] above not Earthly Ambitions where Christ
[9:27] is seated at the right hand of God
[9:29] set your mind on things above
[9:33] not on Earthly things
[9:35] for you died and your life is now hidden
[9:38] with Christ in God
[9:41] when Christ who is your life appears
[9:43] then you you're with him 14. he says
[9:47] forgetting those things which are behind
[9:49] and reaching forth unto those things
[9:51] which are before
[9:53] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[9:56] the eye calling of God in Christ Jesus
[10:00] notice these verses now
[10:03] put your heart on things apart
[10:05] mind on things about press forward
[10:09] everything is forward amen scripture in
[10:12] First Corinthians 9 4 says they would
[10:16] run in a race run all but one receiveth
[10:19] the prize
[10:21] so run that you may obtain
[10:24] amen
[10:26] so having a ambition that you're going
[10:28] to win the race
[10:30] and every man that striving for the
[10:32] Mastery is temperate in all things
[10:35] now they do it
[10:37] to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an
[10:40] Incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[10:43] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[10:47] beat the air so Paul is telling you that
[10:49] he has an ambition
[10:51] amen and this morning we'll speak on a
[10:54] holy ghost filled ambitious Church
[10:56] thanks to the reading of his word amen
[10:59] hallelujah
[11:01] amen
[11:04] now the problem of God tells us
[11:09] that when God speaks to a man
[11:13] he equips that man with faith
[11:17] amen and he has ambition
[11:19] this is a quote now from the prophet of
[11:21] God he says when God speaks to a man he
[11:24] has faith
[11:26] he has ambition
[11:28] and he has a purpose
[11:33] he goes up when God speaks to a man he
[11:36] gives him Faith to do it to accomplish
[11:38] or to achieve what his purpose in life
[11:41] is what God called him to do and he
[11:45] called us to be in the Church of God
[11:48] amen amen amen have you heard the voice
[11:51] of God in this last days amen come out
[11:54] of all my people then he's giving you
[11:56] Faith he's giving you an ambition and
[11:59] he's given you a purpose
[12:01] amen we are to be the most
[12:03] purpose-driven people on the face of the
[12:05] Earth
[12:06] we are not to be living idle lives but
[12:09] we ought to be a Holy Ghost Field
[12:11] ambitious Church
[12:13] and the only way that you can get a holy
[12:15] ghost fill the ambitious church is to
[12:18] have ambitious people
[12:20] men who are not just sitting around and
[12:22] saying oh we'll see where the message
[12:24] takes us no the message has come to
[12:27] equip you
[12:28] all creation is growing to see what the
[12:31] god
[12:38] he says you've got to press through
[12:40] you've got a battle to fight you're
[12:43] going through mind battles you're going
[12:45] through problems and strife and stress
[12:47] in this life you need to overcome these
[12:50] things
[12:51] amen
[12:52] but man has to surrender the prophet
[12:54] goes out to say this is coming from the
[12:56] message a prisoner he says man has to
[12:59] surrender every ambition he's got
[13:02] everything that he is everything his
[13:05] life his soul his body his will
[13:09] Ambitions everything else and becomes a
[13:12] complete a prisoner to Christ who is the
[13:14] word to serve God
[13:17] amen
[13:18] so we can't run this Christian race
[13:21] based on our own ambition human
[13:23] Ambitions and that's what's the problem
[13:25] that entering the church
[13:27] because
[13:32] amen
[13:34] he says God before he could get the man
[13:37] in his hand he has to strip him of his
[13:39] ambition
[13:41] he has to strip him of all his training
[13:44] amen
[13:46] Hallelujah so people are highly driven
[13:49] and ambitious to accomplish worldly
[13:52] ambitions
[13:53] you'll see it in the world today be all
[13:56] that you can be
[13:57] you can become anything you can be but
[14:00] we are not focusing this morning sermon
[14:01] on Earthly things
[14:04] amen there's enough motivation to speak
[14:06] out there
[14:08] his life amen
[14:22] you know that and if you are dedicated
[14:25] to that ambition
[14:31] I put into it is your life
[14:35] but all of our Earthly accomplishments
[14:38] mean nothing in the kingdom of God
[14:41] amen we are happy for you
[14:44] if you've got a doctorate we're happy
[14:46] you know what your doctorate means you
[14:48] can earn more money to take care of your
[14:49] family but make sure you're a good amen
[14:52] caregiver at home make sure you are
[14:54] taking care of your family
[14:57] amen
[14:59] we are happy for you got a job but that
[15:01] holds very little value in the kingdom
[15:03] of God
[15:06] amen God is not impressed a degree
[15:09] that's not hoses in the air thinking
[15:11] that we have some status in this life
[15:13] put some ugly achievement yes yes amen
[15:17] I'm thinking everyone was bother to my
[15:19] doctorate
[15:24] amen the only thing that pleases God is
[15:26] Faith in his word
[15:28] thank you Lord amen
[15:30] how about you get adulthood in faith
[15:34] amen how about you get adopted in the
[15:36] Holy Ghost
[15:38] amen seek ye first the kingdom of God
[15:40] Amen
[15:42] Jesus says in Matthew 6 24 no man can
[15:45] serve two masters either will hate the
[15:47] one and love the other for he will be
[15:49] devoted to the one and despise the other
[15:51] he says you cannot serve God and Mammon
[15:54] money
[15:56] oh this is not for me this morning
[16:01] change your mind
[16:04] it is for you
[16:07] I'm talking to you the one that's saying
[16:09] it's not for you I'm talking about one
[16:11] who's ducking and Diving and not coming
[16:12] to church
[16:13] I'm talking directly to you
[16:17] you're a dismissed to the kingdom of
[16:19] hold you into his kingdom and it's any
[16:22] man that puts his hand to the plow and
[16:24] turns and walks away is not worthy of
[16:26] the kingdom of God
[16:28] he goes on to rebuke them and say you
[16:32] who can't stop devils in my name is here
[16:34] Lord
[16:35] you say I'll say depart from you me you
[16:37] workers of iniquity I never knew you
[16:43] amen
[16:45] hallelujah what are we doing trying to
[16:47] pull you from the groups of hell
[16:50] you're going to die in your condition if
[16:52] you don't surrender your life to the
[16:54] Lord Jesus Christ
[16:57] amen
[16:58] Satan is not called the god of any other
[17:00] age
[17:02] but he's called the God of this evil age
[17:05] amen
[17:07] oh I'm highly ambitious yes Satan was
[17:10] ambitious
[17:11] Satan was ambitious he wanted to be like
[17:14] the most high
[17:22] because he's got the people of the earth
[17:25] bowing down before him he is the God of
[17:28] this evil age
[17:31] amen
[17:33] we read about Abraham's life and how he
[17:35] was a pilgrim and a stranger to the
[17:37] world but he had an ambition
[17:39] to find the city whose building and make
[17:42] it was God Amen
[17:44] he'd just lay around in Babylon when he
[17:47] heard the call he responded to the call
[17:50] if you can hear the voice of God this
[17:52] morning respond to the call this morning
[17:55] amen lead your worldly Ambitions and
[17:58] follow after the Ambitions of God
[17:59] because the land that he will lead you
[18:01] to is Flowing with milk and honey
[18:05] amen
[18:06] Hallelujah something struck Abraham's
[18:09] heart he caught a hold of God and he put
[18:12] his faith into action he wasn't just
[18:14] floating around without any purpose he
[18:17] had faith that there was a city whose
[18:19] build and make it was God an eternal
[18:21] City he had a purpose in life to find
[18:24] that place amen
[18:26] what is your purpose what is your
[18:29] ambition
[18:31] amen Moses had an ambition that he was
[18:34] walking towards
[18:35] amen and he was never the same after
[18:38] that he had an ambition to do something
[18:41] and he was working towards fulfilling
[18:43] that purpose amen and he had a faith to
[18:46] do it he made that good push it and he
[18:49] had it amen he was equipped sweet in his
[18:53] heart
[18:56] and he went out there took God his
[18:59] service according to his will and they
[19:01] were the children of Israel
[19:05] amen
[19:10] even our lord Jesus was ambitious
[19:13] amen
[19:15] Jesus was ambitious he had a purpose to
[19:18] do the will of the father
[19:20] God has selected amen
[19:23] the prophet says God has selected the
[19:25] man for the age and selected the message
[19:27] even the nature of the man that would go
[19:30] over in that age
[19:32] amen so God has selected you for this
[19:35] age
[19:36] God put that nature in you because he
[19:38] knew you're going to overcome this age
[19:42] amen all people think hey God called me
[19:45] into the message to have some mighty
[19:47] Revelation and do nothing about it you
[19:49] think
[19:50] knowledge

[19:55] the church sits still
[19:58] the church was always be on the Move
[20:00] amen the church has got an ambition to
[20:02] move forward
[20:04] but what do we find today we find the
[20:06] message churches dying we find people

[20:21] of the ungodliness in our lives then we
[20:23] can stop saying amen oh nobody's perfect

[20:28] hour God has called you to raise up
[20:30] another standard in this hour
[20:33] yes you know why we say those things
[20:35] it's because we want to continue living
[20:37] in sin
[20:38] but when the Holy Ghost comes and fills
[20:41] you up he has called you the profession
[20:43] you lay down your worldly desires you

[22:24] Christ had an ambition he was driven
[22:26] with ambition to fulfill his purpose
[22:28] amen hallelujah they tried to stop the
[22:32] purpose of Jesus

[22:36] must be about my father's business amen
[22:39] yes amen are you a father's business God
[22:43] doesn't call people with no ambition
[22:45] when he called David he was tending
[22:47] sheep on the backside of the desert and
[22:49] there in the backside of the desert he
[22:51] began to have Supernatural experiences
[22:53] on God's training ground he was killing
[22:55] the lion and he was killing the bed
[22:58] God was giving him Supernatural
[23:00] experiences so when he had time to face
[23:02] the giant he had already had
[23:04] Supernatural encounters
[23:06] [Music]
[23:08] when God Called Moses he was telling jet
[23:10] plus flock he wasn't sitting idly he was
[23:13] working
[23:14] when God called his eye he was serving
[23:16] in the temple when God called Samuel he
[23:18] was serving under Eli when God called
[23:21] Elisha he was working and serving and
[23:23] Elijah when God called Peter he was
[23:26] working in a fishing business but Jesus
[23:29] told him
[23:38] so lazy
[23:46] [Music]
[23:48] Jesus didn't sit around and be idle when
[23:51] the time and when the season came
[23:54] 30 years he waited but he was being
[23:57] trained
[24:00] amen when the right time and season came
[24:03] around yes he got to work and when the
[24:06] work was finished on the cross and he
[24:08] rose again he didn't just sit around and
[24:10] say Church rest
[24:13] I've done it all do nothing
[24:16] but he instructs the 12.
[24:19] and he tells him Jesus asked them to
[24:22] pick up the mantle
[24:24] Jesus tells him and he puts the church
[24:26] under Commission
[24:29] amen and he tells him yeah in Matthew 28
[24:33] verse 18 Jesus came and spake unto them
[24:35] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[24:38] in Earth go in therefore and teach All
[24:40] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[24:42] the father and of the son and of the
[24:45] Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all
[24:47] things whatsoever I have commanded you
[24:49] in love I am with you always even unto
[24:53] the end of the world
[24:55] oh I can just imagine someone say oh
[24:57] Jesus what have you done now
[25:00] you said you're going to pay the price
[25:01] of redemption now you're putting all the
[25:04] work on to me you're telling me to go
[25:06] into the world
[25:07] you're telling me to go and preach
[25:12] you see how God put man as part of the
[25:14] Redemption plan
[25:17] you and I ever want to play
[25:20] and if we are not carrying out the
[25:21] commission
[25:24] then we are not fulfilling God's purpose
[25:28] the Bible says through the foolishness
[25:30] of preaching the gospel he has chosen to
[25:32] save man
[25:36] amen he also told him to tarry now he
[25:39] told them go and preach gospel
[25:42] everybody
[25:45] yes amen I tell you if you've really
[25:48] been filled with the Holy Ghost you
[25:50] wouldn't be sitting like how you're
[25:51] sitting right now no way
[25:54] not in God's economy
[25:56] not only those real people because if I
[25:59] take you to the book of Acts and I'll
[26:01] show you how Holy Ghost Fields Sons and
[26:03] Daughters begin to operate in the spirit
[26:05] begin to move in the spirit and we
[26:08] examine that and patent it with our
[26:09] lives because the Holy Ghost has the
[26:11] same nature the Holy Ghost has the same
[26:13] signs the Holy Ghost has the same
[26:15] wonders
[26:20] fruit
[26:24] you can hide the seed
[26:26] put it in the ground and tell everyone I
[26:29] have Holy Ghost seed
[26:31] I've got message of the our seed but
[26:34] it's summertime
[26:36] it's time to move food bearing time when
[26:40] we see the fruits on the tree
[26:42] it's going to expose what seed was wrong
[26:45] if it's a Pentecostal experience that's
[26:47] what's gonna come forth in fruit bearing
[26:49] time if it's a Baptist experience that's
[26:52] what's going to come talking through
[26:53] bearing time
[26:54] but if it's the message of the hour it
[26:57] is Purity amen and the spoken word is
[27:00] the Original Seed amen fruit bearing
[27:03] time it must produce Sons and Daughters
[27:05] who have possessed the power of the
[27:07] spoken word oh come on give God a praise
[27:10] amen hallelujah
[27:16] to see the time church this is the
[27:18] season this is the hour for the
[27:21] outpouring of the Holy Ghost he says
[27:24] amen wait until the Dynamics strike the
[27:27] mechanics we've had the mechanics all
[27:29] these years but this is the season for
[27:32] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and he
[27:34] said the Dynamics of this church will be
[27:36] a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[27:39] do you want it a double portion
[27:42] anointing
[27:44] a many many men
[27:47] he says don't you see the church is dead
[27:51] why
[27:52] he says there's no more ambition in the
[27:54] church for lost souls
[28:00] you read it don't you see the church is
[28:03] dead
[28:04] and he's not placing it on any other
[28:06] thing he says there's no ambition for
[28:08] lost souls
[28:09] there's no ambition for Matthew 28 19.
[28:12] there's no ambition for Revelation 10
[28:14] 11.
[28:17] but one time the Holy Ghost is fought
[28:19] upon us
[28:20] Sons and Daughters rise up to their
[28:21] potential Sons and Daughters rise up to
[28:24] the ambition of Christ
[28:26] amen it's a new season for the church
[28:28] it's a new experience amen when the Holy
[28:32] Ghost comes think of the day of
[28:33] Pentecost it was a new experience
[28:36] they lost all shyness
[28:38] they could begin to get bold
[28:40] they begin to get Fearless

[29:45] and Lasting after his gift God hasn't
[29:48] called you for that
[29:49] God has called you in the body of Christ
[29:52] and God knows what he is doing he's
[29:54] placed you effectively to work in his
[29:56] kingdom
[29:57] operating the ambition and your
[29:59] potential amen God will play for it amen
[30:09] scripture will be impersonation I need
[30:12] more produce any results
[30:14] but when we get the revelation of the
[30:16] part of the world that we must fulfill

[32:07] amen
[32:12] nothing no one could separate you from
[32:14] your vision or purpose in Christ hear
[32:17] what the prophet of God says I'm not
[32:18] making these things up he says here the
[32:20] Church of the Living God is built time
[32:22] on high ambitions
[32:25] this church must have high Ambitions
[32:27] amen we can't be satisfied with a minor
[32:30] outpouring we want the fullness of the
[32:32] our Glory if nobody else wants it we
[32:34] sing this morning we wanted Lord if
[32:36] nobody else is desirous we are saying we
[32:38] wanted Lord
[32:40] the church must be built on high
[32:42] Ambitions he says when I hear of a
[32:44] church that hasn't got any ambition to
[32:46] grow there's something wrong with their
[32:48] Church the Church of the Living God has
[32:50] a high ambition
[32:52] amen now whenever I'm preaching
[32:54] spiritually
[32:55] you can apply it to your natural life
[32:59] have an ambition one time there's a man
[33:03] living in a shack and all he has is a
[33:05] chin check around him
[33:07] but he has an ambition and a vision even
[33:10] though he's sitting in a shack he has a
[33:12] vision of himself sitting in a house one
[33:14] day Hallelujah he has a vision of
[33:17] himself joining a car one day
[33:19] amen and man with his natural abilities
[33:22] and the natural laws that God has placed
[33:24] on the earth he has enough Faith to
[33:26] raise himself from the condition of 18
[33:28] Shack and is now living in a
[33:30] three-bedroom house
[33:32] he's now driving a car I'm telling you
[33:35] the natural that's why God says seeking
[33:38] first the kingdom because man on the
[33:40] earth naturally copies the things from
[33:42] the kingdom of God
[33:44] have an ambition even in your own life
[33:47] yourself
[33:49] amen but don't let it overtake the
[33:51] ambition of Christ
[33:55] he said that another thing the Church of
[33:57] the Living God is built high because it
[34:00] got high anticipation and expectation
[34:03] do you have an expectation yeah oh no no
[34:06] no that was a weak one that didn't sound
[34:09] like you had an expectation he asked do
[34:11] you have an eye anticipation do you have
[34:13] an eye expectation
[34:17] amen
[34:19] he says well we belong to church Our
[34:22] Father served in the church years ago
[34:24] that might be fine but the Church of the
[34:27] Living God can shift still amen oh
[34:30] brother eating why don't you just
[34:31] continue and let things remain as we
[34:33] were just come and preach some
[34:34] intellectual gospel here no the Church
[34:37] of God hands yet still amen yes I will
[34:40] not stand to see the message die out
[34:43] amen now we're not scared to see this
[34:46] young man of God young daughters of God
[34:48] not receive the baptism of the Holy
[34:50] Ghost and just receive the intellectual
[34:52] part of the message we say no Sons and
[34:55] Daughters must be filled amen
[34:59] Hallelujah
[35:02] it says
[35:04] the Church of the Living God can't say
[35:06] it still it's ambition is to go higher
[35:08] and further
[35:12] take me back
[35:14] take me back dear Lord
[35:17] but I press forward
[35:19] what they had back then was good but I'm

[35:26] forward to it amen amen what they had
[35:30] back there was good it was great but

[35:41] he's going to do even in this church
[35:45] amen what we've been seeing and
[35:47] witnessing in the Supernatural amen is
[35:50] just it it's more portion of his
[35:51] outpouring I'm expecting greater
[35:53] testimony I'm expecting a greater
[35:56] outpouring amen
[35:58] Hallelujah listen to what the problem of
[36:00] God says if you think my vision and my
[36:02] ambition is not aligned to what the
[36:03] prophet is saying he says we see the
[36:06] blind heal today but we don't stop there
[36:08] hear what he says we watch him tomorrow
[36:10] for the death to be raised Hallelujah
[36:14] we see you heal from your sugar diabetes

[36:26] somebody to catch the mission amen
[36:30] the church doesn't sit still it has a
[36:32] high ambition
[36:34] he says we see the blind heal today
[36:36] we're watching tomorrow for the death to
[36:38] be raised we see nature obey his voice
[36:40] we're looking there for the coming of
[36:42] Christ so what is he saying the church
[36:44] is never settled on an experience

[38:05] point in the days of the Apostles and
[38:07] show the supernatural workings of God
[38:09] neither do we have to point to the days

[46:40] amen press forward into the things of
[46:42] God

[46:48] God can look beneath the Gods
[46:55] and you can sow into the heavenlies we
[46:58] want to live beneath our privileges
[47:01] yes
[47:02] he says well I've done my part I brought
[47:05] one sinner in this year and got saved

[48:08] to their Homeland
[48:10] so they didn't want to work they had no
[48:12] ambition
[48:13] so they would take whoops to put them to
[48:15] make them work
[48:17] he says about this one slave you didn't
[48:19] have to whoop him
[48:21] he didn't have to force him to work
[48:25] he had his chest out straight shoulders
[48:29] and he walked
[48:31] and they used to have these auctions
[48:33] where they used to sell off their slaves
[48:34] so a man comes by one day through that
[48:37] farm and he wants to buy this particular
[48:39] slate
[48:40] and the owner of the event says he is
[48:42] not for sale
[48:45] and he asked him why is he different
[48:48] from the other slaves
[48:51] do you feed him different treat him
[48:52] different as he sleep differently in a
[48:54] different place the owner says no
[48:56] he says I come to I had to question
[48:58] myself I come to find out
[49:00] that this man back in his own country
[49:03] his father is a king
[49:05] and though it's not in his own land
[49:08] he carries himself as a son of a King He
[49:11] Walks Like a son of a king
[49:14] amen
[49:17] so what is that he did not allow his
[49:19] enslaved condition to discourage him
[49:23] he was living above the conditions
[49:25] around him
[49:26] because he knew
[49:28] that if only the trumpet sounds one
[49:32] morning
[49:35] foreign
[49:45] of a king he had the potential to become
[49:48] king
[49:49] so he lived with that in mind
[49:52] that he was able to go free
[49:54] he's a king
[49:56] if you ever get free from this life when
[49:59] the chains of this life the Bible says
[50:02] if you overcome this age
[50:04] I will set you on my throne
[50:10] on this age
[50:14] amen
[50:15] the prophet says myest ambition and only
[50:18] ambition is to see Jesus Christ
[50:20] glorified I live for that
[50:23] how was Jesus glorified in brother
[50:26] prayer

[51:11] do what the Joneses want do we care
[51:14] about

[51:18] and they put a question mark so you can
[51:19] put anything in there okay
[51:22] what do we care about what the other
[51:24] message search
[51:25] if they don't do it let us do it anyway
[51:32] if the rest of the nation wants to sink
[51:34] that's up to them

[51:44] we want to have faith we want to have
[51:47] ambition
[51:49] let's believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:51] for he said all things are possible to
[51:53] them that believe verily I say unto you
[51:56] but if you say to this mountain be moved
[51:58] and do not doubt in your heart but
[51:59] believe
[52:00] that what you said shall come to pass
[52:02] you can have what you said I believe
[52:04] that with all my heart you believe that
[52:09] amen
[52:14] he says here find your ambition have a
[52:17] purpose that you're going to be healed
[52:19] for the glory of God then come with
[52:21] faith that I'm going to receive it and
[52:23] you'll get it amen
[52:29] this morning as we draw to a close
[52:31] if there's any worldly ambition in US
[52:34] just worldly desires
[52:36] you know
[52:37] you know what I'm talking to now you're
[52:39] lying you're a message believer
[52:41] how you can talk so delicate
[52:44] I took my best clothes and I came today
[52:46] you're lying you're a message believer
[52:49] you know you don't have the life you
[52:51] don't live the life
[53:00] having any great worldly ambition repent
[53:02] of them right now
[53:05] have the grace enough to repent in his
[53:07] presence
[53:07] [Music]
[53:09] sorry that you wanted to be some great
[53:12] worldly person
[53:13] Lord my complete ambition is to be like
[53:16] Jesus Christ he says come meekly humbly
[53:19] then when you put your hands upon his
[53:21] head and by faith confess your sin Lord
[53:24] I'm sorry Adana
[53:26] then what will happen God will transfer
[53:28] all your guilt over on him and take your
[53:31] innocence and put it back on you
[53:35] and you stand justified in the presence
[53:38] of God because you believed in Jesus
[53:40] Christ his son what a Plan of Salvation
[53:42] then you share in his glory the goodness
[53:46] of God will come into your heart the
[53:48] power of his resurrection will make you
[53:49] a new person it will satisfy every
[53:53] about this maybe you lost your focus
[53:57] maybe you thought hey
[53:59] now I want you to understand
[54:04] why is God choosing to do a new thing
[54:09] when I say new thing the prophet says it
[54:11] is the rising of the son that the
[54:13] Dynamics of this church will be a
[54:16] refilling of the Holy Ghost not that you
[54:18] didn't have the Holy Ghost
[54:20] he says we are waiting for the Dynamics
[54:24] but he said the Dynamics of this church
[54:26] will be a refilling
[54:28] refilling
[54:29] of the Holy Ghost
[54:32] let me ask you this why is it coming in
[54:34] the 117th year
[54:38] you say what are you doing you got to be
[54:39] confused
[54:41] 1906 started the first church age
[54:44] this is the 117th year it equals the
[54:48] first church age Ephesus Church ran for
[54:51] 117 years this year 2023
[54:56] 117 years
[54:59] but we sit and not move
[55:01] when the prophet did tell us
[55:03] this will be a short age
[55:06] why why is the spirit speaking in this
[55:08] line and not only in this church but
[55:09] you'll find other churches
[55:12] spirit of God speaking in a way wake up
[55:16] check your oil
[55:19] check your oil
[55:21] amen people have been running with the
[55:23] wine
[55:24] drunk on the wine but they didn't check
[55:26] the oil
[55:28] you know what I'm talking about why mean
[55:30] stimulation of Revelation people have
[55:33] had wonderful revelations in the message
[55:34] they've been running with the wine but
[55:36] the Bible says hurt not the oil and the
[55:38] wine
[55:39] have you checked up your oil level
[55:41] have you checked up your own business

[1:17:35] the Bible become a new book amen and
[1:17:38] that is how true it is
[1:17:40] and when we went down there it was just
[1:17:43] so beautiful
[1:17:44] it's original if you want to see a
[1:17:46] country that is blessed you go to Israel
[1:17:49] to see it kind of thing yeah

[1:18:36] uh in the places of uh of of business
[1:18:42] will not pack it back into a motor car
[1:18:45] to take it home

[1:18:52] the roadside children lying on the roads
[1:18:56] nobody
[1:19:01] said you
[1:19:02] don't mess with the law in this country
[1:19:06] he says this country there's no nobody

[1:19:10] we're looking at high body walls
[1:19:14] border was the only best time
[1:19:16] not more than that
[1:19:18] that's the border wall and then they got
[1:19:20] the electric fence
[1:19:22] electric fences are even that high
[1:19:24] they're not more higher than that but
[1:19:27] they say if you just take a chance to
[1:19:28] come to that fence
[1:19:30] you must say goodbye to yourself
[1:19:32] and that is how powerful his security is
[1:19:36] you'll find policies everywhere visible
[1:19:38] politics policy invisible policy million
[1:19:41] final Army every day there's no way
[1:19:44] you're gonna find TV
[1:19:46] you know I've been to the to Jerusalem
[1:19:49] Jerusalem
[1:19:50] is
[1:19:51] actually completely sealed
[1:19:55] and you go inside it was just so
[1:19:57] wonderful I thought I'd never make it
[1:20:00] because there's so much more walking to
[1:20:01] do but I just want to praise God through
[1:20:03] your prayer amen amen and the prayer of
[1:20:06] the Saints
[1:20:07] I walk this journey I walked where Jesus
[1:20:11] walked amen I went to his tomb I went to
[1:20:16] his crucifixion
[1:20:17] and so Elijah's place of rest
[1:20:26] where he actually performed that that
[1:20:30] medical it was just some wonderful
[1:20:32] experience
[1:20:34] I went to
[1:20:35] assail the gallery
[1:20:37] it was just so wonderful
[1:20:39] you know there's so much that you can
[1:20:41] talk about it will take you the whole
[1:20:43] day but I just want to get to the point
[1:20:46] you know sometimes when we go out
[1:20:49] our first desire is to be to look for
[1:20:52] Souls amen
[1:20:56] otherwise we're wasting our time and
[1:20:58] purpose
[1:20:59] it's gone as a purpose for us
[1:21:01] and there's a desire to look for Souls
[1:21:04] and uh
[1:21:06] I was talking to people on the plane we
[1:21:10] left here talking to people on the plane
[1:21:12] and while we got on the other side we
[1:21:14] were still talking
[1:21:16] and they you know they noticed something
[1:21:18] different because it was just my wife
[1:21:20] that had long hair
[1:21:22] and it was I against that long pants
[1:21:26] and my wife was wearing a long dress and
[1:21:30] we were just looking so different from
[1:21:31] everybody else
[1:21:33] the other people started you know
[1:21:35] questioning things and we started to
[1:21:37] giving them answers
[1:21:39] but the highlight of everything was
[1:21:42] you know they wanted to know from as
[1:21:45] much difference that we are there
[1:21:47] we started to explain them and they
[1:21:50] understood
[1:21:51] and some people were making more queries
[1:21:54] all the time you know like trying to
[1:21:56] find out why is this band different why
[1:21:58] is that done different
[1:22:00] when the pastor gave me an opportunity
[1:22:02] to serve communities
[1:22:04] until we do foot washing and we take our
[1:22:07] wine you know the the actual wine is as
[1:22:11] a community he said okay let's do it
[1:22:13] and then uh
[1:22:16] we went to
[1:22:18] to to the birthplace of Jesus Christ
[1:22:21] and I mean the Tomb of Jesus Christ and
[1:22:24] we did a communion there
[1:22:26] I want to tell you it was an experience
[1:22:30] so the devil always have his ways
[1:22:33] they always want to come and kind of cut
[1:22:35] across everything that we do you know
[1:22:39] when we started the communion
[1:22:41] the rain started pouring
[1:22:44] we had to hold umbrellas and everybody
[1:22:46] holding umbrellas their winds started to
[1:22:49] blow and it was
[1:22:50] cold ice physical
[1:22:53] I thought I was going to come home with
[1:22:55] a pneumonia and I was very sick after
[1:22:58] that
[1:22:59] but anyway I preached on the communion
[1:23:02] and told them that uh
[1:23:05] this communion was not supposed to be
[1:23:07] taken during the day
[1:23:09] and after communing with this food
[1:23:13] washing party
[1:23:14] and
[1:23:16] you know while I was praying
[1:23:18] there was a sister you know sometimes if
[1:23:22] you don't recognize the Angels standing
[1:23:23] by the servant of God
[1:23:26] somebody else will see it
[1:23:29] somebody else will see it
[1:23:32] because I think we are too what you call
[1:23:35] used to that yeah you know we are so
[1:23:39] complacent
[1:23:41] there is nothing that seems real to us
[1:23:44] because that's how complacent we are
[1:23:47] because we have these basics for such a
[1:23:49] long time with your long dresses
[1:23:52] long hair
[1:23:54] leave the makeups
[1:23:56] but we don't want to see the
[1:23:58] supernatural yes and the people that
[1:24:02] want to see the supernatural have a
[1:24:04] desire in their hearts
[1:24:06] and we are the ones today you should be
[1:24:09] having the desire to see the
[1:24:11] supernatural because we are waiting for
[1:24:13] his coming amen
[1:24:15] and the prophet said this is not going
[1:24:17] to be a big show
[1:24:20] it's going to be a one-off thing and
[1:24:22] over
[1:24:24] and as I finish reading the word
[1:24:29] while I was praying
[1:24:32] I said you know and I stood up and said
[1:24:35] you know what the Eastern Angel standing
[1:24:37] right here
[1:24:39] and that is why we have to approach this
[1:24:41] very referently
[1:24:43] you know when I finish the service
[1:24:45] there was so much of rain everybody
[1:24:47] despair we had eight dishes to do this
[1:24:49] or I mean
[1:24:51] but there's one brother stood up he said
[1:24:53] you know what I never had experienced
[1:24:56] this in my life before I want to wash
[1:24:59] your feet and I want you to wash my feet
[1:25:01] amen for an example all those people
[1:25:04] that was you know it was I couldn't
[1:25:06] blame them some of them would have done
[1:25:08] it some of them wouldn't have done it
[1:25:10] but we're not forcing anybody but this
[1:25:12] brother said I'm going to do it now
[1:25:14] irrespect of the rain the brothers held
[1:25:17] the umbrella and we did the foot washing
[1:25:18] and the people just watched
[1:25:21] and it was an experience for other
[1:25:23] people and there's a sister
[1:25:26] she came up to me and she said you know
[1:25:28] what brother
[1:25:29] while you were standing there and he was
[1:25:33] while he was preaching
[1:25:36] I saw something
[1:25:39] that I never saw in all my life amen
[1:25:42] amen she saw she said she saw a cloud
[1:25:45] right behind amen and she saw a rainbow
[1:25:48] over there
[1:25:51] now I want to tell you something
[1:25:54] nobody told her about a cloud Amen in my
[1:25:57] Ministry I never said anything about a
[1:25:59] cloud
[1:26:01] nobody spoke about a rainbow
[1:26:03] but she saw a rainbow and a cloud amen
[1:26:07] and she just pondered whether she was in
[1:26:09] a vision
[1:26:10] or she was just standing and looking at
[1:26:13] something
[1:26:15] and as she said when she looked at that
[1:26:18] he saw a light just flash
[1:26:22] now my brother my sister there is
[1:26:23] something serious amen amen and she had
[1:26:26] so much of questions on the way
[1:26:28] he still got questions
[1:26:31] and another brother who stood right in
[1:26:33] the back
[1:26:34] and he had a doubt in his heart he said
[1:26:37] you know what this is something
[1:26:37] something a tradition and I explained
[1:26:40] the tradition to them also about the
[1:26:43] food funky and the rest of the things I
[1:26:45] explained that out for them this was not
[1:26:47] the food funky because this was a
[1:26:49] different occasion
[1:26:50] and then he said you know what
[1:26:52] I saw a cloud in the light
[1:26:55] nobody
[1:26:56] talk about cloud
[1:26:58] even during our our conversation we
[1:27:01] never spoke about cloud
[1:27:03] and another sister came up
[1:27:05] and she said you know what I saw this
[1:27:07] light
[1:27:08] flashing all the time
[1:27:11] you know I want to say sometimes
[1:27:15] don't want to accept
[1:27:18] that experience here that is why we
[1:27:21] cannot see it
[1:27:22] and the old brother came up and he said
[1:27:25] you know what
[1:27:26] I've never seen something like this
[1:27:29] he said that place behind where you were
[1:27:31] standing and the other brothers were
[1:27:33] standing he said it was just so lit up
[1:27:35] and the rain was pouring but the place
[1:27:37] was lit up
[1:27:39] he says how do I see these things
[1:27:41] I said my brother you have gifted me
[1:27:43] God has given you a gift
[1:27:46] that you could see something amen and
[1:27:48] then he came to me while we were going
[1:27:52] to buy something to eat
