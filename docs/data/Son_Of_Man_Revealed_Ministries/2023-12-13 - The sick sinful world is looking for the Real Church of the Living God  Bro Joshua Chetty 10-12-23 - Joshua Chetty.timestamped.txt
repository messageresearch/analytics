[9:12] right I was sharing with brother Caleb
[9:15] about how child birth can be
[9:25] painless and I know some of you are
[9:28] shocked now yeah because if you read in
[9:30] Genesis
[9:31] 3 it's after the fall that the Lord God
[9:36] is speaking to eve and he's saying in
[9:39] sorrow you shall conceive and bring
[9:42] forth his
[9:43] child but you know Jesus took away the
[9:47] curse come on
[9:50] now on the cross he took away the curse
[9:53] he removed the
[9:55] curse amen but you got to believe it
[9:58] amen you got to believe that Jesus
[10:00] removed the curse and you say Lord
[10:02] because you remove the curse I don't
[10:05] have to experience the effects of the
[10:08] curse but that's for whosoever will
[10:10] believe I know it takes a great amount
[10:12] of Faith to believe that because amen

[21:02] be stored up yes everything had to be
[21:04] there with laying within the word
[21:07] amen and he
[21:12] said thou has as a OD

[21:36] naturally but we can see by faith that
[21:39] they in another dimension yes amen and
[21:43] it came because that's what happened
[21:46] Elisha the the other dimension was open
[21:49] yes to Elisha yes to see another
[21:52] dimension
[21:55] amen and it came to pass as they still
[21:58] went
[21:59] on and talked that behold there appeared
[22:03] a chariot of fire ERS of
[22:06] fire amen and parted them both as and
[22:09] Elijah went up by Whirlwind into heaven
[22:13] amen a dimension is open up to Elisha
[22:15] and dimension has been opened to us in
[22:17] this hour that we can see the
[22:19] supernatural in this hour amen you Lord
[22:24] amen oh yes and Elijah saw it
[22:28] and
[22:29] cried amen you seen the supernatural in
[22:32] his hour my father my father The Chariot
[22:35] of Israel and the asman thereof and he
[22:38] saw him no more and he took all of his
[22:42] own clothes and ran them in two
[22:45] pieces yes he took up also the mantle of
[22:49] Elijah that fell from him and went back
[22:52] and stood by the bank of
[22:55] Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah
[22:58] that fell from him and smokee the waters
[23:00] and said where is the Lord God of
[23:05] Elijah it wasn't good enough that he had
[23:08] the mantle but now he want to operate in
[23:10] the spirit of Elijah so now he's crying
[23:13] out for the Lord God of that was in upon

[24:55] praise the

[24:59] morning the sick sinful
[25:03] world is looking for a real Church of
[25:06] the Living God yes am amen amen you
[25:09] believe we have we are in a time where
[25:11] the world is sinful yes it's sick

[25:41] God they they want some help they're
[25:44] going to church because they want some
[25:45] peace yes they want some help in their
[25:48] life and the god that they read about in

[42:39] 2,000 years

[43:25] to me yes right no he knew Satan was
[43:28] running the kingdom of the earth he's
[43:30] the God of this evil age and so we are

[43:36] pleasures of this life but we have a
[43:40] mission and we must remain focused amen
[43:44] amen Satan

[44:12] making making us go off the straight and
[44:15] narrow road yes you know that's what he
[44:18] wants to do he wants to paralyze your
[44:20] faith and how do you paralyze your faith
[44:22] when you walk in wickedness when you
[44:25] remain in and remaining pleasures of
[44:27] this world he will paralyze your faith
[44:31] because what he does once he take you
[44:33] off that straight and narrow road and
[44:35] bring you into this world of pleasure

[44:40] remember it it is not he's going to do
[44:43] it very subtly yes that's right amen you
[44:46] might wonder you might think he's just
[44:48] going to take you and throw you into a

[55:08] how he was moved when he saw the people
[55:10] and that's how he healed the people amen
[55:12] amen the prophet did the same thing he

[55:45] amen so God got a plenty of
[55:49] blessings our own faith you're afraid to
[55:52] us because you're thinking kindly now
[55:54] you're thinking how you operate in the
[55:56] natural in the natural firstly we are we
[55:59] have finite
[56:01] Minds yes we don't have infinite
[56:04] Minds we are fin everything we have is
[56:07] limited we're limited with time yes we
[56:10] trapped in time we are limited with
[56:13] finances we are limited with the things
[56:16] we have
[56:18] materially but you are a supernatural
[56:20] being so don't be defied by natural
[56:24] things yes be like David when he faced
[56:26] golad he didn't look at an
[56:29] uncircumcised golad right there he
[56:31] didn't look at the size of Goliath right
[56:33] there and he didn't look at himself as
[56:35] being inferior but he knew the spirit of
[56:37] God was upon Him amen and he knew when
[56:40] the anointing comes upon him what he did
[56:42] to the lion when the anointing comes
[56:44] upon him what he did to the bear and he
[56:46] knew now that he's going there by the
[56:48] Mandate of God he knew that when the
[56:49] anointing comes upon Him Goliath is
[56:52] nothing because he knew that he
[56:55] experienced the supernatural already
[56:56] Hallelujah and this natural
[56:58] circumstances is not going to not going
[57:00] to stop him amen this natural Goliath
[57:03] this uncircumcised natural circumstance
[57:06] around you is not going to stop you amen
[57:09] because amen you have the experience the
[57:11] supernatural amen praise the Lord thank
[57:14] you I love the way he put this one here
[57:17] he says could you imagine a little fish
[57:20] about that long out in the middle of the
[57:22] ocean saying I better drink of this
[57:24] Waters speing I might run out someday oh
[57:28] my that's nothing compared with what the
[57:31] blessings of God got for you Hallelujah
[57:34] could you imagine a little mouse under
[57:37] the great Garners of Egypt saying I just
[57:40] better eat a few grains each day because
[57:42] it might not last through the winter why
[57:45] he could never eat in a thousand
[57:48] lifetimes neither Could You observe the
[57:51] blessings that God's got laid up from
[57:53] you if you live 10 million years on here
[57:57] on Earth there's still a plenty of
[58:00] blessings for you who is the
[58:02] inexhaustable Fountain of Life am when
[58:05] you plant yourself in him by his
[58:07] Fountain is like the tree that's planted
[58:09] by the rivers of waters how glorious and
[58:12] how he likes to push forth His blessings
[58:14] to his people and give to them
[58:18] abundantly amen and he's been blessing
[58:20] us this year amen so don't think that it
[58:23] stopped there amen it's exhaustible so
[58:25] keep asking of him say Lord more of you
[58:28] Lord more of you lord lord I need more
[58:31] of you amen amen don't think he's going
[58:34] to stop amen he hasn't stopped what
[58:36] started is going to continue till we
[58:37] leave this earth amen amen because amen
[58:40] there's a quickening power available
[58:42] right now amen you know that quickening
[58:44] power was upon Elisha yes that when he
[58:46] was dead years and years and then they
[58:49] put a man there yes amen that dead man
[58:52] came to life amen when the dead man ch
[58:55] bones amen it came to life because there
[58:57] was so much of quickening power there
[58:59] amen there's so much of quickening power
[59:00] here that one day we're going to it's
[59:02] going to empty out the other dimension
[59:04] because because of the sons of God are
[59:06] coming to maturity in this hour our
[59:08] nature is groaning God must come and
[59:10] empty out that sixth Dimension and then
[59:12] we going to leave
[59:14] amen that quickening power that's when
[59:16] is going to change this Mortal body to
[59:18] immortality amen amen thank you Jesus
[59:23] amen
[59:28] Glory he says now could you imagine
[59:31] after that blessing being promised this
[59:33] young preacher how he kept his eyes
[59:35] right on Elijah I tell you if somebody
[59:38] said look over here Elijah or some noise
[59:41] happened over here Elisha kept his eyes
[59:43] right on Elijah he wanted that double
[59:46] portion and if you want the double
[59:48] portion tonight keep your eyes on Jesus
[59:51] amen don't pay any attention to what the
[59:54] devil say
[59:56] the devil's going to give you all your
[59:57] natural circumstances to say you're not
[59:59] fit
[1:00:00] enough he's going to bring condemnation
[1:00:02] and remind you of your past is going to
[1:00:04] remind you of your failures but you tell
[1:00:07] him there is now therefore no
[1:00:09] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:00:12] Jesus and called according to his
[1:00:14] purpose amen
[1:00:16] amen so don't listen to what the devil
[1:00:19] says and what the critic says and what
[1:00:21] un what the unbeliever says keep your
[1:00:23] eyes set on Calvary saying Lord you
[1:00:25] promised it yes thank amen Jesus
[1:00:31] amen amen we are called to preach the
[1:00:34] gospel to go into all the world and
[1:00:36] preach the gospel we're not asked to go
[1:00:39] and have seminaries we're not asked to
[1:00:41] go give the people theology we asked to
[1:00:43] preach the gospel with power and
[1:00:46] demonstration
[1:00:48] amen didn't Paul say in the second
[1:00:51] Corinthians what did he say there he
[1:00:53] says in second 1 Corinthians 2:4 he says
[1:00:57] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:01:00] with enticing words of man's
[1:01:03] Wisdom but in
[1:01:06] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[1:01:10] yes that your faith should not stand in
[1:01:13] the wisdom of men yes amen but in the
[1:01:17] power of God
[1:01:19] Amen Hallelujah that's the problem with
[1:01:22] us so as it's when natur
[1:01:25] sometimes we we we get fascinated with
[1:01:27] the way people can bring forth the word
[1:01:32] and the way they can uh show you the
[1:01:34] word the mysteries in the Bible and show
[1:01:37] you the the message in such a way and
[1:01:39] bring all these things but if that
[1:01:41] Ministry cannot produce the power and
[1:01:44] then the demonstration of the Gospel
[1:01:47] amen then you got to ask yourself if
[1:01:49] that same person they're teaching this
[1:01:51] word in that way does he know and have a
[1:01:53] personal relationship with the god of
[1:01:55] that word amen because every one of us
[1:01:57] that preach the gospel must have a
[1:02:00] personal relationship with the God of
[1:02:02] this Bible Hallelujah if we are claiming
[1:02:04] that we believe in the message of the
[1:02:06] hour in the in the in the message that
[1:02:08] William Brandon preached that we must
[1:02:10] know the god of William brandham amen we
[1:02:13] must know the god of Elijah
[1:02:18] amen I can quote to you quote after
[1:02:21] quote I can give you scripture after
[1:02:23] scripture but if I I haven't had an
[1:02:25] experience yes with the god of the
[1:02:27] scripture with the god that's behind the
[1:02:30] cods
[1:02:32] amen then I need to go have an
[1:02:34] experience and each one of us have to
[1:02:36] have our own experience that's the
[1:02:39] journey that we take amen that's why we
[1:02:41] are called The Church the called out
[1:02:43] ones he's calling us out of every system
[1:02:46] of the world yes because we come into
[1:02:48] church that means we coming to Christ
[1:02:50] amen we come to be Christlike yes we
[1:02:53] come to be partakers of his nature amen
[1:02:55] and we come to do the very works that
[1:02:57] Jesus Christ did it's a continuation yes
[1:03:01] yes if you look from the book of Acts
[1:03:04] when they continued they continued doing
[1:03:06] what Jesus did
[1:03:08] amen Jesus uh after 40 days of his
[1:03:13] resurrection he departed he ascended to
[1:03:15] heaven and he put his Spirit upon the
[1:03:17] church and they continued the same works
[1:03:20] then when the people saw them they said
[1:03:23] they recognized that they these people
[1:03:25] have been with Christ yes how did they
[1:03:27] recognize that he's been with Christ by
[1:03:29] the very works that they did
[1:03:31] amen but the very nature that they had
[1:03:35] they projected Christ in everything they
[1:03:37] did right so how people will know that
[1:03:39] we are being with Christ is by our very
[1:03:42] Works yes amen The Works that we
[1:03:45] manifest amen if we claim to experien
[1:03:47] the supernatural that it must manifest
[1:03:50] in the natural yes
[1:03:52] amen otherwise we just saying it but
[1:03:56] we're not practicing it amen amen it
[1:03:58] must operate in the
[1:04:01] natural amen when Elijah when
[1:04:05] Elisha and that the dimension open to
[1:04:07] him and he saw Elijah parting and the
[1:04:10] spirit Came Upon him he continued
[1:04:14] because when he came to receive the this
[1:04:16] side of
[1:04:18] Jordan Elijah had to part the waters so
[1:04:21] when he's going now he continued the
[1:04:24] work of elishah yes but with a double
[1:04:26] portion amen so it must be a
[1:04:29] continuation of the Gospel the gospel
[1:04:32] can't remain stagnant it the power and
[1:04:35] demonstration of the Gospel must
[1:04:36] continue until we leave this earth
[1:04:40] amen until and even when we leave the
[1:04:43] Earth do you know there's going to be a
[1:04:44] continuation of the Gospel yes it
[1:04:47] continues amen amen it goes to Moses and
[1:04:50] Elijah will be presenting the same
[1:04:52] gospel to the under 44,000 Jews amen
[1:04:56] They will receive the same baptism of
[1:04:58] the Holy Ghost that you receiv yes
[1:05:00] amen we are preaching about people that
[1:05:02] are in history now they going to speak
[1:05:05] about other as being in history and
[1:05:06] they're going to speak about God in
[1:05:08] their day amen amen so just let we speak
[1:05:12] about God in our day God working amongst
[1:05:15] us God doing the supernatural amongst us
[1:05:18] but don't be afraid ask in plenty what
[1:05:21] did the prophet say God loves that God
[1:05:23] loves it that way amen amen ask him in
[1:05:26] plenty he wants to bless you abundantly
[1:05:29] thank you Lord he
[1:05:31] said now we had plenty of passing of
[1:05:35] tracks and theology around the
[1:05:39] world but the
[1:05:41] gospel
[1:05:43] is sorry not the Bible Al together Paul
[1:05:46] said the gospel came to us not in word
[1:05:49] only yes but through Power and
[1:05:54] demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen yes
[1:05:58] then when Jesus said go into all the
[1:06:02] world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:06:04] Creature then he meant go into all the
[1:06:07] world and
[1:06:10] demonstrate the power of
[1:06:13] godallah to Every Creature yes that
[1:06:16] means to all mankind animal nature to
[1:06:20] everything Dominion again Amen to all
[1:06:22] creation amen yes Every Creature to have
[1:06:26] dominion again did he come and show us
[1:06:28] the first you did he come and show us
[1:06:30] what he did to kill a bull yes spoke to
[1:06:32] you amen love projected amen didn't he
[1:06:36] come and speak to the honors love
[1:06:37] projected amen amen so God has given us
[1:06:41] the same ability amen he said with power
[1:06:45] and
[1:06:47] demonstration
[1:06:49] than and in order to preach the gospel
[1:06:52] before you can make it a gospel preach
[1:06:55] you've got to have the power and
[1:06:58] demonstration of the Holy Spirit to
[1:07:00] prove the gospel amen the letter kill it
[1:07:05] the spirit make it alive
[1:07:07] amen because they going to come a
[1:07:09] showdown amen they'll come a
[1:07:13] showdown remember when
[1:07:16] this was it one of the Simons Simon the
[1:07:20] 10 Simon the
[1:07:22] S one of them was it was trying to cast
[1:07:25] out the spirit he
[1:07:27] saying Jesus we know Peter and Paul
[1:07:30] Peter and John we know but Peter and
[1:07:33] Paul we know but who are you
[1:07:36] yes you're going to face you're facing
[1:07:38] demon powers they say William random we
[1:07:41] know Holy Ghost men we know but who are
[1:07:44] you yes amen don't come and quote to us
[1:07:48] you can't go and quot without the
[1:07:51] without the Holy Ghost amen because you
[1:07:53] can take the the code and make a mess of
[1:07:54] the quotes there's be there's people all
[1:07:57] over YouTube doing that right now they
[1:07:59] make a mess up they misinterpreting the
[1:08:01] quotes they're confusing the people in
[1:08:03] the world yeah because they don't
[1:08:06] understand it because they don't have
[1:08:07] the Holy Ghost and you can't speak to
[1:08:09] them because they're not born again you
[1:08:11] can't explain Supernatural things to
[1:08:12] people that are not born again so they
[1:08:15] trying to take a supernatural message
[1:08:17] with they caral and try to understand it
[1:08:19] with a fine caral
[1:08:22] mind but when you are born again and you
[1:08:26] experience the supernatural then you'll
[1:08:28] understand Supernatural things amen then
[1:08:31] you begin to see this message you won't
[1:08:33] even be you won't even debate the cloud
[1:08:35] anymore because you can see why that had
[1:08:37] to happen you can see it in scripture
[1:08:39] amen if you anything in the message you
[1:08:41] must see it in the
[1:08:42] scripture if there's something that in
[1:08:44] the message that that you can't see in
[1:08:46] the scripture then I understand but what
[1:08:48] the prophet is preaching I'm talking in
[1:08:50] in terms of the opening of the word you
[1:08:52] must see it in the scripture yes any
[1:08:54] Doctrine you must see it in
[1:08:56] scripture and when you see it in
[1:08:58] scripture you see the continuity of it
[1:09:00] because the Bible is the the Bible
[1:09:03] written by different authors Yes Men
[1:09:05] filled with the Holy Ghost years apart
[1:09:08] but all is coming with the same story
[1:09:11] yes amen it's got the same story from
[1:09:14] Genesis to Revelation it's got the same
[1:09:16] theme it's a plan of God's Plan of
[1:09:18] Redemption and how God is working he's
[1:09:21] showing you the uh the shadows and Liv
[1:09:24] in the Old Testament what must happen in
[1:09:25] the New Testament amen so it's coming in
[1:09:28] a continuation the Bible is a
[1:09:29] continuation yes amen amen and this word
[1:09:33] has got so much of quickening power in
[1:09:36] it I'm telling you there's coming an
[1:09:39] hour where you're walking down the
[1:09:41] street and demons are going to flee from
[1:09:43] people you don't believe that that
[1:09:45] happen in the book of Acts amen amen yes
[1:09:48] the demon must say what what have we to
[1:09:51] do with you rather so and so
[1:09:54] or you come with the spirit of Christ
[1:09:56] what have you come here for yes why have
[1:09:58] you come to chase us
[1:10:00] way without you even saying a word that
[1:10:03] quickening power lays in you amen amen
[1:10:06] there must be so much of Christ in you
[1:10:08] that that person
[1:10:09] speaking they recognize I can't be
[1:10:11] around this person they must be such an
[1:10:13] they must be so uncomfortable that
[1:10:15] person cursing that person saying all
[1:10:17] the filthy jokes they must be
[1:10:19] uncomfortable around you all that Spirit
[1:10:22] must depart from them
[1:10:24] they must having convulsions amen
[1:10:27] yeah not long ago I was telling brother
[1:10:30] aen I think I was on the
[1:10:32] phone so uh someone came and greeted me
[1:10:35] at my office and as they they greeted me
[1:10:38] I looked at them in the eyes they left
[1:10:41] and as they left the demons are
[1:10:43] manifesting because why demons must
[1:10:45] recognize sons of God yes demons must
[1:10:49] recognize who you are yes and I told you
[1:10:51] the other
[1:10:52] incident many years ago when I first
[1:10:55] came in the message we we went up and we
[1:10:58] were called to a situation where there
[1:11:01] was this mental patient who used to be a
[1:11:03] rugby player and we had to climb up a
[1:11:05] big ladder and I recognize that this
[1:11:08] person had a demon spirit I said this
[1:11:10] people is not mental this the person not
[1:11:12] insane you think insane this is a demon
[1:11:15] spirit so the first thing I said to this
[1:11:17] person in the name of Jesus Christ hold
[1:11:19] your peace and this is what he did put
[1:11:21] his hand like this and he just got stuck
[1:11:24] on the wall yeah amen and I told the
[1:11:27] people around me this is a demon Spirit
[1:11:29] we have to tackle it in a different way
[1:11:31] they didn't listen to
[1:11:33] me they tried to tackle him naturally
[1:11:35] Carly now I told you you can't fight
[1:11:37] Satan on Satan's
[1:11:39] ground you can't fight Supernatural
[1:11:41] demon with your natural
[1:11:44] abilities and then they try to throttle
[1:11:47] this person and put him down and Tackle
[1:11:49] him down eat everyone finished every one
[1:11:52] of them the demon spirit
[1:11:54] gave them until I started binding him in
[1:11:56] the name of Jesus binding that spirit
[1:11:59] and then he started quoting The Book of
[1:12:00] Psalms quoting scripture accurately
[1:12:03] until I bound him bound him and finally
[1:12:05] restrained
[1:12:07] him so what I'm saying the prophet given
[1:12:10] illustration like that as well he spoke
[1:12:11] about this lady the man brought his wife
[1:12:14] to this place brought her down the
[1:12:15] staircase in the basement of the church
[1:12:17] there and then he went the man said he
[1:12:20] even said to the prophet don't go over
[1:12:22] there because she had so much of power
[1:12:24] ability that when they tried to even the
[1:12:27] the ambulance wouldn't bring her they
[1:12:29] had to bring her in a car and then she
[1:12:30] even had to breaking the glass in the
[1:12:32] car and she was full of Glass on her and
[1:12:36] then the first time the prophet went to
[1:12:37] her she
[1:12:40] started she put her hand out and the
[1:12:42] prophet thought he's going to talk to
[1:12:43] her but then the Spirit came started
[1:12:46] moving like a snake
[1:12:48] eing and then the prophet went and then
[1:12:50] he prayed but not long after the lady
[1:12:52] was delivered himen he met the lady
[1:12:54] again she was a normal lady with a
[1:12:56] family and everything she got delivered
[1:12:58] because the spirit Satan cannot
[1:13:00] withstand the spirit of Christ amen
[1:13:02] demon powers cannot withstand the spirit
[1:13:04] of
[1:13:07] Christ so we had all this plenty of
[1:13:09] Theology and sex around the world
[1:13:11] Amen we had plenty of giving up the
[1:13:14] message we had plenty of death message
[1:13:17] went around the world message has gone
[1:13:19] to every almost every country continent
[1:13:23] to jungles of Africa to the mountainous
[1:13:25] areas to the islands going to remote
[1:13:31] areas but what we need now in this hour
[1:13:34] to this Dying World to this world that
[1:13:36] is in Gross darkness is the power and
[1:13:40] demonstration of the Gospel amen before
[1:13:43] we leave this earth there must be an
[1:13:44] impact there must be a showdown there
[1:13:47] must be a power and demonstration of God
[1:13:50] and there's been many false prophets
[1:13:51] there's been all the false anointed ones
[1:13:53] they coming with they've been using the
[1:13:55] gifts lusting after the gifts actually
[1:13:58] but they must be the genuine amen
[1:14:01] amen prise the
[1:14:08] Lord John 14:12 he says verily verily I
[1:14:11] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:14:13] works that I do he shall do also and
[1:14:16] Greater Works than these shall you do
[1:14:19] because I go unto my father and
[1:14:21] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[1:14:23] will I do that the father may be
[1:14:25] glorified in the son
[1:14:27] am if ye shall ask anything in my name I
[1:14:30] will do it amen did he say something no
[1:14:34] he said anything yeah in my name I will
[1:14:37] do it amen but this not for everybody
[1:14:40] this is for a son and daughter of God
[1:14:42] yes amen the scripture is not for the
[1:14:44] world yes this is John
[1:14:46] 14:12 is for those that will do the
[1:14:48] greater work that's the body amen this
[1:14:51] scripture is not for the false anointed
[1:14:52] on not this scripture this scripture is
[1:14:55] for the body of Christ because he said
[1:14:58] You shall do the Greater Works and who's
[1:15:00] doing the Greater Works it's the body of
[1:15:02] Christ amen amen Revelation 10:11 says
[1:15:06] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:15:08] again for many people and Nations and
[1:15:11] tongues and Kings amen amen when elishah
[1:15:16] took the double portion anointing he had
[1:15:18] to go and complete the work of the
[1:15:19] Prophet amen he had to go on a prophetic
[1:15:22] Journey yes when you took the word of
[1:15:24] this Prophet Amen in this hour you
[1:15:26] become the prophetic voice in this hour
[1:15:28] amen how you become the prophetic voice
[1:15:30] you know what's Happ Before Time you
[1:15:33] know who the Antichrist is you know
[1:15:35] what's going to happen to all the nation
[1:15:37] you know about Daniel's prophecy you
[1:15:39] know what the word you know the Seven
[1:15:41] Seals has been revealed to you who the
[1:15:43] Antichrist spirit is who America is who
[1:15:45] is Russia in Prophecy you know what all
[1:15:47] these things that are coming upon the
[1:15:49] Earth the pestilences the famines the
[1:15:51] economic crisis nothing is
[1:15:54] nothing should be shocking to you you
[1:15:56] know that all these things must
[1:15:58] happen so you become the prophetic voice
[1:16:02] in this hour exposing Satan's schemes
[1:16:05] and his tactics that's why Paul said we
[1:16:07] not unaware of Satan's SCH amen
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:35] he said there's Elisha Elijah was
[1:16:38] perfect type Elijah and elishah of the
[1:16:40] church and Christ now notice Elijah
[1:16:43] being the type of Christ when he went to
[1:16:45] leave before leaving he made preparation
[1:16:48] that the spirit of God must remain on
[1:16:50] the
[1:16:51] earth now God takes his man never his
[1:16:58] Spirit now God took Christ but the holy
[1:17:01] spirit yet tonight vindicating him just
[1:17:04] the same Lord Jesus he took Elijah He
[1:17:08] Came Upon Elijah Came Upon John the
[1:17:11] Baptist and The Same Spirit made Elijah
[1:17:13] act like Elijah made John the Baptist
[1:17:15] act like Elijah and he makes the church
[1:17:17] today act like Christ
[1:17:19] amen the devil takes his Spirit oh sorry
[1:17:22] the devil takes his man but never his
[1:17:25] Spirit them same teachers back there
[1:17:27] that condemned Jesus Christ they were
[1:17:30] Scholars to the minute they were far
[1:17:32] beyond our Seminary students today in
[1:17:34] the
[1:17:35] world they were holy men no one could
[1:17:38] put a hand on them they had to be holy
[1:17:41] they had to be righteous they had to be
[1:17:43] blameless but yet powered by Satan
[1:17:46] didn't recognize the Son of God and
[1:17:47] condemned and killed him that's right
[1:17:50] and the spirit lives on today people who
[1:17:52] are just as fundamental just as
[1:17:55] scholarly and teacher as they can be
[1:17:59] having a form of godliness and denying
[1:18:03] the power thereof
[1:18:06] yes the Bible said from such turn away
[1:18:09] so don't even debate with them they want
[1:18:11] to come and debate with you or message
[1:18:13] theology don't debate if they're denying
[1:18:16] the power no matter howly they might be
[1:18:19] but if they denying the power
[1:18:21] demonstration of the Gospel
[1:18:23] don't debate yes just turn away the
[1:18:26] Bible says that he
[1:18:28] says turn away brother they know the
[1:18:31] word so
[1:18:34] perfect just set it in order lay it out
[1:18:37] there in such a
[1:18:40] masterpiece trust me in our young when
[1:18:44] we first started preaching we
[1:18:47] were struck in awe at certain preaches
[1:18:50] at the way they can present the gospel
[1:18:51] in such eloquence and present the
[1:18:54] scriptures in such
[1:18:56] eloquence but they come the time where
[1:18:58] you go back to the word yourself and go
[1:19:00] see that nobody no preacher on Earth
[1:19:03] preach it like the way the prophet
[1:19:04] preach everything is laying in the
[1:19:05] message amen everything is laying in the
[1:19:08] word but when God can take a a man that
[1:19:11] will humble himself and say Lord I
[1:19:13] surrender to you yes and have the Holy
[1:19:15] Ghost he can take that same word and
[1:19:17] shine light on it amen light on it
[1:19:19] that's what the fivefold the true
[1:19:20] fivefold ministry will do take this word
[1:19:23] that already is Tau up and shine light
[1:19:25] on it make it a present word
[1:19:27] amen so it says such a master be yet
[1:19:31] know no more about God than a hoton to
[1:19:34] would know about an Egyptian KN look at
[1:19:37] the way he expresses it what he trying
[1:19:39] to say they don't have a personal
[1:19:40] experience yes am they have intellect
[1:19:44] they have wisdom yes they can take the
[1:19:46] quates and place it together in such a
[1:19:48] nice way and show you all these things
[1:19:50] they can take the scriptures but you
[1:19:52] must have a personal experience amen you
[1:19:54] must know this God of the Bible amen you
[1:19:59] and this God is a supernatural God Amen
[1:20:01] to have this experience IM me you must
[1:20:03] have time with him
[1:20:06] amen that's right only thing you know
[1:20:09] just the word the letter came the spirit
[1:20:11] give it life lives come by the word made
[1:20:13] manifest amen this Prophet had to debate
[1:20:17] big giants in his time remember he come
[1:20:20] from the Baptist background and Baptist
[1:20:22] theology and you know Baptist
[1:20:23] theologians know the word they know the
[1:20:27] scriptures but he had to tell them as a
[1:20:29] little young boy that he had met a being
[1:20:33] that he met an
[1:20:34] angel you think that was easy for him to
[1:20:36] tell
[1:20:37] them and the time where people didn't
[1:20:39] experience Divine Healing on the
[1:20:43] Earth but but if you go on further
[1:20:46] Prophet says I read a book of Wesley and
[1:20:50] Methodist who don't want to he about
[1:20:51] healing but you know Wesley when he went
[1:20:53] to pray for somebody riding his horse
[1:20:57] the horse broke his leg he Anointed The
[1:20:59] Horse oyal pray for us and he car jumped
[1:21:01] on us and he carried on Prophet said he
[1:21:04] got a book written by Wesley himself in
[1:21:06] his
[1:21:09] notes so you see people from the Ages
[1:21:11] was experiencing the gospel people who
[1:21:14] had their personal experiences
[1:21:17] amen he said oh God how we need that
[1:21:20] today with many a school and educated
[1:21:23] Scholars with many men who can tear the
[1:21:25] Bible apart and set it together in
[1:21:27] mathematics many men who can do great
[1:21:29] things in the ways of teaching who knows
[1:21:31] the Bible History to the very moment who
[1:21:33] can tell you the hour the candle was lit
[1:21:35] and the hour it went out they can tell
[1:21:37] you all these things they got the water
[1:21:40] baptism they got the spiritual baptism
[1:21:42] that they call it the robe they got
[1:21:44] everything just set in
[1:21:46] order so did Elisha but when he come
[1:21:50] down to the Jordan to face the critical
[1:21:53] world what did he
[1:21:56] cry where is the god of Elijah amen it
[1:22:00] wasn't the robe of Elijah that done it
[1:22:03] it was the power of the god of Elijah
[1:22:06] that done it
[1:22:08] amen and the thing the world Le this
[1:22:11] morning is the power of the god of
[1:22:15] Elijah yes amen you might have spoke
[1:22:19] spoke with tongues and shouted and run
[1:22:21] over the floor but what we need is the
[1:22:24] power of the god of Pentecost Amen to
[1:22:27] produce the lives and things that was
[1:22:29] lived in that day in the apostolic
[1:22:32] power a second-handed robe was all right
[1:22:36] but he needed a fresh call in his heart
[1:22:39] from God yes don't take the experience
[1:22:42] and just talk about the prophet's
[1:22:43] experiences and the prophet testim which
[1:22:45] is fine which is good we have received
[1:22:48] it we have received all of that but we
[1:22:50] need our fresh experiences amen amen
[1:22:53] amen he needed a fresh anointing from
[1:22:56] God He Wore a second-handed robe when he
[1:22:59] come to the river but when he needed a
[1:23:01] brand new first entered call from God
[1:23:04] and the first entered power from God to
[1:23:06] perform the miracle and my brother don't
[1:23:10] you be afraid to ask God anything yes
[1:23:13] yesen you must demand God yes ask God
[1:23:17] for anything that he has promised yes so
[1:23:19] you have the right to demand a promise
[1:23:21] amen if God promised it you have the
[1:23:23] right amen yes Lord for
[1:23:27] I am introducing a God that's only
[1:23:30] potent and all powerful amen and if I be
[1:23:33] a servant of God I must do the works of
[1:23:35] God and if I do the works of God I must
[1:23:38] demand of God to bring these things to
[1:23:41] pass amen because he is demanding of me
[1:23:44] to produce the impossible yes amen I
[1:23:47] have to ask him I have to call upon him
[1:23:49] and stand there and say God you promised
[1:23:52] it yes so do you every person amen so if
[1:23:56] there's a promise in the Bible you got
[1:23:58] the right to demand it of God because
[1:24:00] God is demanding of you to bring his
[1:24:02] word to pass in this hour God is

[1:24:43] going to back up his word amen amen
[1:24:47] thank you
[1:24:50] Lord just going to end this last quote
[1:24:53] he said sitting right in this building
[1:24:54] tonight I believe Mr Isaacson my
[1:24:57] finished
[1:24:58] interpreter that was there in Finland
[1:25:01] when the vision came forth and the
[1:25:02] little boy was raised from the dead
[1:25:05] laying on the side of the road which the
[1:25:07] vision was told two years before it
[1:25:09] happened and the night when
[1:25:13] 25,000 in the mesali and then turn that
[1:25:18] 25,000 out and let me speak to another
[1:25:21] 25,000
[1:25:23] when I was going down the street there
[1:25:25] stood Russian
[1:25:26] soldiers and when I passed by a little
[1:25:29] finnished soldier trying to protect me
[1:25:30] from the crowd and get to the mesu Hal
[1:25:34] they stood with their Russian salute
[1:25:36] with tears running down running down
[1:25:38] their cheeks and they said we will
[1:25:41] receive a god like that sure a god of
[1:25:46] power but their Creed is no more than
[1:25:48] our Creeds and I seen with my own eyes
[1:25:51] Russian soldiers put their arms around
[1:25:53] finish soldiers and pet one another on
[1:25:56] the back and kiss on the side of the
[1:25:57] neck and call each other brother and any
[1:26:00] power that will make IR Russian and f
[1:26:03] one another would settle Wass forever am
[1:26:06] that is the question Christ is the
[1:26:09] answer you'll never do it by passing
[1:26:12] tracks or teaching theology it will be
[1:26:14] the power of his resurrection that will
[1:26:18] prove to them that Christ still lives
[1:26:21] amen so today what the world needs is
[1:26:24] the power and demonstration that Jesus
[1:26:27] Christ is risen from the dead and is
[1:26:29] alive forever more and that is working
[1:26:32] amongst Believers as he did in the day
[1:26:34] of Pentecost he's still doing it today
[1:26:37] amongst many member body doing the
[1:26:39] Greater Works and that's the gospel the
[1:26:42] unbeliever will come to right now when
[1:26:45] they have no hope right now and
[1:26:47] everything has every politician has let
[1:26:48] them down right now the economies have
[1:26:51] let them down
[1:26:52] right now the families have let them
[1:26:54] down right now the friends have let them
[1:26:56] down the only thing they need right now
[1:26:58] is the power and demonstration of the
[1:27:01] Gospel of Jesus Christ L amen that will
[1:27:04] turn the hearts
[1:27:07] amen so we find that these
[1:27:11] are the things that we have the
[1:27:14] potential for amen amen we have the
[1:27:17] answer you believe that am who is the
[1:27:20] answer to the world to Jesus
[1:27:22] and if we have Jesus in US Jesus is
[1:27:25] being produced through us then who has
