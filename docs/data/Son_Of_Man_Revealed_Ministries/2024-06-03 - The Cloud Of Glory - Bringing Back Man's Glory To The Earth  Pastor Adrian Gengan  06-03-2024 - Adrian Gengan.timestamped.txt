[2:30] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:32] Christ for much Thanksgiving we ask
[2:34] these things amen thank you amen I greet
[2:37] you all in the precious name of our Lord
[2:39] and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[2:42] what a privilege to come back in the
[2:43] house of the Lord to worship him and
[2:45] give him praise amen amen let's go to
[2:48] our Bibles even as we go to the word of
[2:50] the lord we go to Genesis chapter
[2:53] 1
[2:57] amen so if you were
[3:00] here last week you would hear amen the
[3:02] different ministers were preaching on
[3:04] the
[3:04] cloud amen and they were showing you how
[3:07] the cloud in the Old Testament the cloud
[3:10] in amen was there for 6 days on the
[3:13] mountain and then on the seventh day
[3:16] amen Moses went up into the cloud he was
[3:19] caught up into the cloud and then we see
[3:21] brother brandham amen the cloud was year
[3:24] for 6 days and then on the seventh day
[3:27] he was caught up into the cloud amen
[3:29] amen am Hallelujah so there was a
[3:31] purpose for that amen and we know the
[3:34] cloud is not a water vapor
[3:37] Cloud hallelujah amen the
[3:40] cloud is the prophet is tying up now you
[3:43] remember what he said if the vision is
[3:45] scriptural it must be interpreted by
[3:48] scripture so being a scriptural prophet
[3:50] he goes to the scripture and he takes
[3:52] Revelation 10 to interpret the vision
[3:54] that he had about seven angels coming to
[3:57] him amen amen praise the Lord thank you
[3:59] L amen so we'll read here in Genesis
[4:02] chapter 1 amen we got to look at the
[4:04] origin of
[4:09] man maybe you're asking why you so
[4:11] fixated on men why you keep because we
[4:14] are men yes amen you know if you lost
[4:18] something you'll spend day and night to
[4:20] get back to what you lost am amen so
[4:24] where we are right now we're not in our
[4:26] ought to be condition amen and I think
[4:29] some times the channels get clogged up
[4:31] because there's a difference between the
[4:33] Genesis one man that God made and what
[4:35] we call today as
[4:37] human that's an Earthly thing that these
[4:39] people put a name to call us human
[4:42] there's nothing human about us you know
[4:45] we when we talk to one another we also
[4:46] try and find sympathy with it and we say
[4:48] oh I'm only human I'm subject to faults
[4:51] and mistakes who told you that you're
[4:54] human
[4:57] amen amen
[5:00] amen you're talking the the language of
[5:02] the world Amen you're a son and daughter
[5:05] of the most high God amen amen and
[5:08] that's why I'm saying our language needs
[5:10] to change amen everything about us needs
[5:12] to change to realize that we are made
[5:15] you know the prophet says if you take a
[5:17] a teaspoon of the ocean everything
[5:20] that's in that deep ocean day is in that
[5:22] teaspoon amen so we reading the quotes
[5:25] about how you rotated off of the eternal
[5:28] spirit when God created you amen the
[5:31] spirit man so you are have the same
[5:34] attributes the same substance the same
[5:36] material as God Amen thank you Lord amen
[5:40] hallelujah thank you Lord amen and I
[5:42] pray that Revelation really opens up to
[5:44] us thank then we move away from the
[5:46] carnality of life amen when we realize
[5:49] who we are to be then Romans 8 will
[5:51] become more clear to us where it says we
[5:53] are groaning within ourselves amen
[5:55] longing to go back to our first estate
[5:58] amen amen Hallelujah I know some of you
[6:01] want to believe that amen God had made
[6:03] you just to be a human mortal being on
[6:05] the Earth but God made you to be a God
[6:07] on the earth amen that's right Genesis
[6:12] 1:26 so God is finishing creating all
[6:15] all of creation he comes now and he says
[6:19] let us make man in our image after our
[6:22] likeness and let them have dominion over
[6:25] the fish of the sea over the fowl of the
[6:27] air over the cattle over the Earth Earth
[6:30] and over every creeping thing that
[6:31] creepeth upon the Earth so notice the
[6:34] first part if he's going to make Man In
[6:36] His Image and after his likeness he
[6:38] needs to use the god substance the god
[6:41] material yeah he's not going to the
[6:43] ground
[6:45] yet can you say amen amen can somebody
[6:48] believe that yes amen yeah he's saying
[6:50] let us make man in our image if God
[6:52] wants to make Man In His Image he must
[6:54] use the same
[6:55] substance he must use if he wants to
[6:57] make him in the same likeness he must
[6:58] use the same
[7:01] substance then he gives him Dominion 27
[7:04] so God created man so first he asks the
[7:08] question now watch many trinitarians
[7:11] think they got us there by saying when
[7:12] he says let us make
[7:14] man right but watch 27 puts it in
[7:17] context and it speaks of God singular
[7:20] amen amen created Man In His Image not
[7:25] their
[7:26] image In His Image in his own image
[7:29] in the image of God created him male and
[7:32] female created he them and God blessed
[7:35] them and God said un unto them be
[7:37] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[7:40] Earth and subdue it and have dominion
[7:42] over the fish of the sea and over the
[7:44] foul of the air and over every living
[7:47] thing that moveth upon the Earth amen
[7:50] amen you see who God is giving Dominion
[7:52] to he's not saying I'm going to control
[7:55] these things I'm placing you man to have
[7:58] dominion amen amen hallelujah and you
[8:01] must be fruitful
[8:03] amen amen so God has it in his mind that
[8:06] this man must reproduce
[8:09] himself and God said behold I have given
[8:11] you every herb bearing seed which is
[8:14] upon the face of the all the Earth every
[8:17] tree in the which is the fruit of a tree
[8:20] yielding seed to you it shall be for
[8:22] meat and to every beast of the earth and
[8:25] to every foul of the air and to
[8:27] everything that creepeth upon the Earth
[8:29] Earth wherein there is life I have given
[8:31] every green herb for meat and so it was
[8:34] and God saw everything that he had made
[8:36] and behold it was very good and the
[8:38] evening and the morning were the sixth
[8:40] day amen you may be seated the Lord at
[8:42] blessings to the reading of his
[8:45] word so if God intended this man to have
[8:48] dominion over the Earth how is he going
[8:51] to control the Earth so the power of the
[8:54] spoken word amen amen amen you remember
[8:58] now brother random after the seals he's
[9:00] speaking on Amen that the spoken word is
[9:02] the Original Seed amen The Original Seed
[9:06] in the beginning was God's spoken word
[9:08] let there be so if God made this man
[9:10] after his own substance after his own
[9:13] Essence his own character his own nature
[9:16] this man possesses the ability to speak
[9:18] amen amen amen let's go to our next
[9:21] scripture we'll go to Psalm 115 amen so
[9:24] we always say God is God of the heavens
[9:27] and man is God on the earth that's how
[9:29] God intended it to be amen so we take
[9:32] the scripture here in Psalm 115 and
[9:35] we'll see
[9:36] here Amen in verse 16 it says the heaven
[9:41] even the heavens are the
[9:44] Lords but the Earth at he given to the
[9:47] children of men amen amen amen the Earth
[9:53] is given to the children of
[9:56] men now those are sons of Adam
[9:59] amen so we find here
[10:02] amen let me ask you this question before
[10:05] we continue are you satisfied with your
[10:07] current condition as a son and daughter
[10:10] of
[10:10] God are you where you ought to be
[10:13] spiritually in your growth and journey
[10:15] in
[10:16] Life or do you desire more amen amen so
[10:22] if God had to call you home today are
[10:24] you satisfied that you have fulfilled
[10:26] the purpose of
[10:28] God
[10:30] amen or will you say Lord I just need a
[10:34] few more years to put myself in
[10:36] order put things right amen amen what
[10:41] would it be because we ought to be ready
[10:43] at all times amen amen amen we something
[10:48] is definitely
[10:50] wrong because it can't be 60 years after
[10:54] the prophet brings such a powerful word
[10:56] to the
[10:58] Earth word that is perfect word that is
[11:01] here to produce a perfect faith in a
[11:04] people that all that he prophesied about
[11:07] the people of God that those people are
[11:10] not in alignment with what he
[11:12] spoke that's right then there's got to
[11:15] be a problem and like we've been doing
[11:18] spiritual
[11:20] Diagnostics and we realize amen that in
[11:22] order to get the glory back you've got
[11:25] to connect with the angel of God amen
[11:28] amen
[11:29] yes
[11:31] amen you've got to be able to connect
[11:33] with the angel of God in order to be
[11:36] able to operate as a son and daughter of
[11:38] God in this time and
[11:40] season we have beautiful sermons which
[11:43] we might call sermons but they were
[11:45] truths spoken to us these are the
[11:47] divinely revealed mystery truths yes
[11:50] amen amen so these mystery truths that
[11:53] were revealed to us were not just
[11:55] beautiful sermons but it was Amen to
[11:57] take away our IIA yes to make us
[12:00] recognize who we are as Sons and
[12:02] Daughters of God to make us realize that
[12:05] we are not just mortal mere mortal men
[12:07] but we are supernatural beings amen
[12:11] amen amen hallelujah therefore as
[12:14] supernatural beings we take control over
[12:17] every situation in our lives amen we
[12:20] take dominion over every
[12:22] situation amen hallelujah so God does
[12:25] not want us to stay in the condition
[12:28] that we are in
[12:29] right God wants us to progress and come
[12:32] up higher in the things of God come up
[12:34] higher in our Revelation come up higher
[12:36] in our spiritual walk with him amen
[12:39] until we become amen so full the prophet
[12:42] says amen that you become a Powerhouse
[12:44] of God Amen a living Tabernacle of the
[12:47] most high
[12:48] God so we find the glory what we just
[12:51] read there now the glory was given to
[12:54] men yes that is why Satan comes into the
[12:57] garden because because he sees the glory
[13:00] of God in this man he see this man with
[13:03] the possesses the ability to speak you
[13:06] remember Satan wanted to be like the
[13:08] most high God and now he's a man on the
[13:11] earth like the most high God Amen
[13:14] Hallelujah so God had made a man in His
[13:16] image and his likeness but Satan wanted
[13:18] to make a man in after his image he
[13:21] wants to make a man after the image of
[13:23] the
[13:25] Beast oh thank you Jesus so say comes
[13:29] knowing that he can use the body of the
[13:31] serpent to infiltrate the the plan there
[13:35] and he he takes the body of the serpent
[13:37] he incarnates The Serpent and he injects
[13:40] his seed into the human race yes that's
[13:43] what's called The Serpent seed yes amen
[13:46] but when this fall happens you find the
[13:48] curse the glory is
[13:50] taken from
[13:52] man eternal life is taken from man man
[13:56] loses his Godlike qualities
[14:00] amen amen hallelujah so this is now
[14:03] fallen man these are sons of Adam who
[14:06] can never redeem themselves that's right
[14:08] because no man is found worthy no none
[14:12] of the sons of Adam were found worthy to
[14:14] bring Redemption back to man right amen
[14:18] amen they tried to find it through the
[14:20] prophets amen but each one of them had
[14:22] their weaknesses amen each one of them
[14:24] typed Christ in part but all of them had
[14:27] weaknesses that they could could not
[14:29] fully Express the glory of God through
[14:31] their lives so if the glory is taken
[14:34] away from man and like the prophet says
[14:37] he calls it the title deed the title
[14:39] deed to man's inheritance which is
[14:41] eternal life the power of the earth
[14:43] power over the Earth amen and fellowship
[14:46] with God this is taken away from man the
[14:49] title deed to the Earth and It Go the
[14:52] prophet says Satan can't take it that's
[14:56] amen he's not authorized to take it so
[14:58] the book has to go back to the original
[15:01] owner yes amen amen and that's God
[15:05] Almighty amen but God knows that the
[15:08] book does not belong in heaven oh that's
[15:10] right the authority over the Earth does
[15:12] not belong in heaven yes it belongs to
[15:15] the Earth yes amen amen it belongs to
[15:18] man amen hallelujah hallelujah so we
[15:22] find here remember God is Not defeated
[15:24] in his purpose God now allowed this and
[15:27] he gave made man with the ability to
[15:31] choose so he gave man the ability to
[15:34] choose and that choice amen is what
[15:37] Satan worked with he used doubt and he
[15:39] used reasoning yes and he came through
[15:41] the woman and he deceived the woman amen
[15:44] hallelujah and that's how he swed his
[15:46] seed into the human race and that's how
[15:48] the glory was taken away from man and
[15:51] you find that God put a cherubim there
[15:54] with a flaming sword so that man could
[15:56] not he says if man took from the the
[15:58] tree of good and evil man can now take
[16:01] from the Tree of
[16:02] Life but God does not want man to have
[16:05] eternal life in a fallen State amen so
[16:08] he protects the way to the tree of life
[16:11] amen yes so man can't regain his glory
[16:15] yes he's got to wait for the appointed
[16:18] time and the appointed season oh yes
[16:20] amen praise the Lord man has got to wait
[16:22] for the appointed time and the appointed
[16:24] season amen when somebody will be found
[16:27] worthy to bring back man's inheritance
[16:30] to the Earth amen yes Lord thank you
[16:33] amen I want you to know that you are not
[16:34] in you ought to be conditioned you the
[16:36] family that you were born in is not amen
[16:38] you ought to be conditioned amen
[16:40] hallelujah that is God's permissive will
[16:43] that you came through a sex body amen
[16:45] but the real you I'm talking on the
[16:47] inside of you you possess a seed gen
[16:50] Gene of God within you a germ of God
[16:52] within you amen a soul that God put
[16:54] within you and only you can be reborn
[16:57] when Jesus said you must be born again
[17:00] he's talking about people who have the C
[17:02] Gene of God within them not everybody
[17:04] can be born again there are millions of
[17:06] Christians but they are not born again
[17:08] brother brand says only those who they
[17:10] have SE Gene of God within them can be
[17:13] reborn give God praise amen that's
[17:15] predestination for
[17:17] you thank you Lord yes amen so no matter
[17:21] how much they they toy with the idea you
[17:23] must be born again be born again born
[17:25] again they cannot be born again because
[17:27] they don't have the Gene within
[17:31] them only Sons and Daughters can be
[17:35] reborn thank you amen now you know why
[17:38] Jesus said all that the father has given
[17:40] me will come to me and not one of them
[17:42] is
[17:43] lost amen hallelujah these scriptures
[17:46] are there amen and when you try to show
[17:49] people predestination they don't want to
[17:51] believe it amen
[17:52] hallelujah
[17:54] amen thank you Lord amen aren't you glad
[17:57] that not one of you you is lost amen
[18:00] amen you might grope around in sin for a
[18:02] while amen but if you're an attribute of
[18:04] God Amen if you came from the back part
[18:06] of God's mind amen you're going to burst
[18:09] through every sin you're going to burst
[18:11] through every unbelief amen you're going
[18:12] to come forth in this time and season
[18:15] and take your place as a son and
[18:16] daughter of God on the
[18:19] earth amen and Satan and none of his
[18:22] demons can stop you from coming forth oh
[18:25] thank you Lord amen so we find here that
[18:29] 4,000 years pass and God now amen in his
[18:33] predes plan he knows that he can't send
[18:37] somebody else to the Earth amen but he's
[18:40] got to come back to the Earth amen and
[18:42] he can't work to the body of a man but
[18:45] he's got to create himself a body have I
[18:47] created amen yes amen L I come in the
[18:50] volume of the book amen so the word
[18:53] became flesh that's John 1 now the word
[18:56] becomes flesh and it dwells amongst us
[18:59] amen and when you're looking at Jesus
[19:01] you are seeing the type of man that we
[19:03] ought to be amen because Jesus did not
[19:06] buypass his theophany amen hallelujah
[19:09] you are seeing a God man you are seeing
[19:11] a man in control of creation you are
[19:14] seeing a man who can restore man the
[19:16] eyesight because he has the authority on
[19:18] the earth he can speak to winds he can
[19:21] speak to waves amen he can multiply Fish
[19:24] and Loaves he has complete dominion over
[19:26] the Earth amen amen
[19:29] amen creative power is locked up in this
[19:32] man because the fullness of God was in
[19:35] Jesus Christ yes he dwelt in him bodily
[19:39] amen so when they looked at this man
[19:41] they had never known a man like this so
[19:43] they start to question what manner of
[19:45] man is this that even the winds the
[19:47] waves the Seas obey him we don't know
[19:50] about this kind of man and in this 21st
[19:52] century they still don't know about this
[19:55] kind of a man because this kind of man
[19:57] is on the Earth again
[19:58] Mark 11:23 man a man who possesses the
[20:02] power to speak over situations a man who
[20:05] is able to believe his own word and not
[20:07] doubt his own word that man is back on
[20:10] the Earth again amen give God praise
[20:13] amen they didn't understand it back then
[20:16] they had the question back then what
[20:18] manner of man is this and they still
[20:20] have the question here today when they
[20:22] see Sons and Daughters of God operate
[20:25] under the power and the anointing of God
[20:27] they say what manner of man is this amen
[20:31] oh thank you Lord amen hallelujah so
[20:34] Church what I'm trying to tell you you
[20:36] and I cannot be silent amen Earth
[20:39] responds to your voice amen Earth
[20:41] responds to the vibrations coming out of
[20:43] your mouth amen so you need to take
[20:46] control of every situation you need to
[20:48] stand up in this hour and take control
[20:50] of every trial every circumstance every
[20:54] sickness don't back down amen maintain a

[27:18] hallelujah amen this year amen we are
[27:21] focused and what the Lord is doing in
[27:23] our lives is to display and manifest

[27:29] strong way to tell you that you are the
[27:32] same substance as God Amen oh yes amen

[28:18] Bible says all of these things shall be
[28:20] added unto you amen if you're going to
[28:22] look at what Jesus is talking about all
[28:23] of these things talking about your daily
[28:25] needs the cares of the life amen
[28:28] hallelujah amen so here comes the Lord
[28:31] Jesus Christ and he is the perfect
[28:34] sinless spotless lamb that can take away
[28:37] the sin of mankind amen yes because he
[28:40] is God in
[28:41] flesh and he's called the Lamb of God
[28:44] and John identifies him and he says
[28:46] Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away
[28:49] the sin of the world amen amen praise
[28:52] the Lord Brothers I don't think there's
[28:53] load sharing tonight amen but you can
[28:55] just check that they've suspended Shing
[28:57] as far as I'm I'm aware
[29:01] amen praise the Lord amen so behold the
[29:05] lamb now watch even before Jesus does
[29:08] anything John
[29:14] prophesies even before Jesus does
[29:16] anything yes John prophesies Behold the
[29:20] Lamb of God Amen that takes away the sin
[29:23] of the world Amen come on now yes the of
[29:27] Elijah is prophesying over the groom
[29:32] amen when you're reading William
[29:34] brandham the for Elijah he's looking at
[29:37] the bright broom and he starts to
[29:38] prophesy over you he says a sinless
[29:41] spotless amen spotless wife of the Lord
[29:44] Jesus Christ amen hallelujah she's born
[29:46] of his bone she's flesh of his flesh
[29:49] amen yes Lord amen amen thank you amen
[29:54] amen
[29:56] hallelujah when Adam looks at at Eve he
[29:59] identifies her he gives her her identity
[30:03] and he says you are me yeah you are me
[30:07] right he comes in this time and in this
[30:09] season amen and he says this bride you
[30:12] are
[30:13] me you are me reproduced on the earth
[30:16] you are my feminine part amen hallelujah
[30:19] and because the feminine part the
[30:21] deception came through the feminine part
[30:23] in the beginning I'm going to have the
[30:25] feminine part on display at the end
[30:27] and this one will not fall by reasoning
[30:30] this one will not doubt the word amen
[30:33] this one will stay true to the word amen
[30:35] Satan will come and try at every point
[30:37] but this one will be Resolute on the
[30:39] word it is written it is written it is
[30:42] written amen this one is established on
[30:44] the word of God Amen this one is
[30:47] established on the mechanics amen and
[30:49] this one has the Dynamics amen that has
[30:51] come upon the mechanics to make it live
[30:55] amen so that Satan can reason with this
[30:58] the written word because she is the
[31:00] manifested word amen because the words
[31:04] have moved from out the pages of the
[31:06] book and now when you're looking at me
[31:08] and you you are seeing the word on
[31:10] display amen you are seeing a product of
[31:13] the word amen hallelujah no longer just
[31:16] a written word amen but now moved into
[31:19] tablets of Flesh amen amen hallelujah
[31:23] when I look at you I'm looking at the
[31:25] manifested word I'm looking at prophecy
[31:28] hallelujah amen so when very quickly now
[31:31] Jesus comes there and he pays the price
[31:34] for
[31:35] Redemption but that's paying the price
[31:37] for Redemption laying down his very own
[31:40] life amen but Redemption all also
[31:44] requires just not only just paying the
[31:46] price but it also requires the the
[31:49] claiming
[31:50] part
[31:52] yes amen amen so now remember a man
[31:56] needs to get to to
[31:57] Heaven yes where's the book
[32:01] Amen in heaven yes Revelation 4 you go
[32:05] and see it there amen one sitting on the
[32:08] throne he's got the book yes what is the
[32:11] book the title deed to man's
[32:16] inheritance but now there's no man on
[32:19] the earth that can go up to
[32:22] heaven except the man amen thank you
[32:26] Lord
[32:27] so he comes amen he you know he
[32:30] died they killed him on a Roman
[32:34] cross on a Roman
[32:37] Tree amen
[32:39] hallelujah they put him on a tree
[32:42] because man stole from the
[32:45] tree amen they put a crown of thorns on
[32:49] his head because that was part of the
[32:51] curse yes the thorns and thistles oh yes
[32:56] am amen so he's basically taking the
[32:59] curse upon
[33:01] himself
[33:03] Wonder amen he's literally taking the
[33:05] curse upon himself
[33:08] amen and he's put on display he dies
[33:12] amen but he prophesies about his own
[33:13] death and he says bury this temp amen
[33:16] put this temple in the ground after 3
[33:18] days I'll raise it up amen so we know
[33:19] what Jesus does Amen if we know amen
[33:22] that you can go and read in tement and
[33:23] all these messages and the prophet will
[33:25] tell you exactly what Jesus Does on the
[33:27] ministry the ministry in the grave how
[33:29] he goes down there to the souls that are
[33:31] imprisoned amen and he preaches to them
[33:33] those Souls Amen in Noah's day and how
[33:36] they rejected the message and he goes to
[33:37] present the gospel to them and then how
[33:40] he takes the keys of death hell and the
[33:41] grave amen he gives Satan a great big
[33:44] kick amen and then he ascends and he
[33:46] goes to the paradise and then he empties
[33:49] out
[33:50] paradise amen hallelujah amen amen and
[33:55] then on the third day Jesus Christ Our
[33:57] Lord and our savior he rises
[33:59] triumphantly from the grave right amen
[34:03] no other man did that I have power to
[34:06] lay my life down I have power to raise
[34:08] it up again amen hallelujah the gospel
[34:12] of the Cross is so powerful the gospel

[34:33] that amen hallelujah and if you know
[34:36] amen when he died I died when he rose I
[34:39] Rose amen and that's his empty grave
[34:42] there in Israel but that's also my empty
[34:44] grave because I shall never be confound

[42:00] Angel if you go and look at that word
[42:03] it's a mighty Angel yes proclaims who is
[42:06] worthy Amen to take the
[42:09] book it's now after seven Church
[42:13] ages remember they couldn't find Jesus
[42:16] because he was in the sanctuary he's the
[42:19] high priest am amen making
[42:22] intercession that's now Revelation
[42:24] chapter 1 the one in the midst of seven
[42:27] golden
[42:28] candlesticks amen hallelujah so they
[42:32] Search Heaven they search the Earth they
[42:36] even search beneath the Earth meaning
[42:38] the realm of the
[42:39] Dead to find a man who's worthy to bring
[42:43] back the glory down to man to bring back
[42:46] man's inheritance so that he can possess
[42:48] the power of the spoken word yes amen so
[42:51] that he can possess eternal life he can
[42:54] possess fellowship with God yes yes amen
[42:57] and dominion over the Earth but there's
[43:00] nobody found worthy including John who
[43:02] is the
[43:04] bride yes amen if you read the breach
[43:08] message you'll see where brother Brandon
[43:10] talks about what the book actually
[43:13] is amen it's a book of redemption it's a
[43:16] titled deed of man's inheritance and it
[43:18] says it's traced all the way back to the
[43:21] original owner amen meaning that there's
[43:24] no other ears you see you see
[43:27] there in
[43:29] El's
[43:31] inheritance what was Boaz doing he was
[43:34] redeeming elc's inheritance but there
[43:38] was a nearer
[43:40] Kinsman amen amen amen but he did not
[43:43] want to take responsibility to redeem
[43:46] elc's inheritance right so he goes
[43:50] before the elders yes this is what is
[43:52] happening in Revelation 5 now Jesus
[43:55] before the elders
[43:56] Elders if you read Revelation 5 you'll
[43:59] see the elders are there yes amen so
[44:02] it's Boaz going before the elders and
[44:04] you know he takes his sandal and he
[44:06] beats it amen hallelujah amen and he
[44:09] says let it be known today that I am
[44:11] redeeming elc's inheritance that's Nomi
[44:15] and together with Nomi his a
[44:18] daughter-in-law
[44:20] ruthen yes that's right yes so Satan
[44:24] can't redeem this book in heaven you
[44:26] can't bring the glory back to the Earth
[44:28] John can't do it the 24 Elders can't do
[44:31] it the Beast can't do it the angels in
[44:33] heaven can't do it but they can't find
[44:37] one worthy so you got to ask yourself if
[44:40] they searched Heaven they searched Earth
[44:42] they search beneath the Earth why
[44:43] couldn't they find Jesus because Jesus
[44:46] is a now called the high priest after
[44:49] the order of MDC and you know the high
[44:52] priest when he went into the sanctuary
[44:54] nobody could go into the
[44:57] Sanctuary they had to wait for the
[44:59] priest to come back
[45:00] out that is why they could not find
[45:03] Jesus amen they had to wait for seven
[45:06] Church ages to finish when he asked to
[45:08] make intercession for seven Church ages
[45:12] make an atonement for seven Church ages
[45:15] amen by the end of the seventh Church
[45:17] age he is coming back out from the
[45:19] sanctuary amen
[45:21] amen because he had to make intercession
[45:24] for every name that was in the
[45:28] book yes because he's now taking you
[45:31] from the L from The Book of
[45:34] Life remember through your natural birth
[45:37] you came in The Book of Life yes and
[45:40] he's transferring
[45:42] you to the lamb
[45:45] section
[45:46] Hallelujah putting you back in your
[45:49] original position oh yes amen you see in
[45:53] the Book of Life all man born of a woman
[45:57] can appear there but in the Lamb's Book
[46:00] of Life the lamb section it's only his
[46:04] redeemable attributes that are found in
[46:06] the lamb section of the book of
[46:09] life amen praise the Lord amen so you f
[46:14] you see here nobody's found worthy but
[46:17] then one of the elders says John don't
[46:21] weep
[46:22] yes for the lion of the tribe of Judah
[46:25] had prevailed am
[46:27] amen amen and he is worthy to take the
[46:31] book amen notice again prophecy before
[46:36] he does
[46:38] it you see all this time I'm prophesying
[46:40] to you about your original condition
[46:43] before you can probably even do
[46:45] it I'm telling you you're a God man
[46:48] telling you you're a God woman on the
[46:50] earth that's right I'm prophesying it
[46:53] before you so what did the Elder cry
[46:56] behold the L John said it obviously on
[46:58] the earth Behold the Lamb of God before
[47:01] he did it here now in heaven the Elder
[47:03] says the line of the tribe of Judah has
[47:06] prevailed Amen to take the book amen
[47:09] before he does it that's then he comes
[47:11] forth and he does
[47:13] it amen so I'm I'm praying tonight that
[47:16] somebody will catch what I am saying
[47:18] amen I'm prophesying you ought to be
[47:20] conditioned and then I'm waiting for you
[47:22] to come and do it amen amen amen
[47:26] amen so now Jesus comes we know when
[47:29] John turns to L he doesn't see the lion
[47:31] that the Elder say he sees a lamb as it
[47:34] had been
[47:36] slain and then he takes the book from
[47:38] the one that's Seated on the
[47:40] throne amen and then you find there now
[47:44] going into Revelation chapter 6 he
[47:46] starts to break those
[47:49] seals he starts to expose the Satan the
[47:52] Satan schemes and he's right and we know
[47:55] he's broken they in symbol form nobody
[47:57] understood what the symbols were yes
[48:00] amen so he breaks it first in symbol
[48:05] form and then we find amen it unfolds
[48:09] all the way to Revelation chapter 8
[48:11] where when he had opened the seventh
[48:14] seal there was silence in heaven for
[48:17] about the space of half an
[48:18] hour you know uh there's some preachers
[48:21] who preach this and I just want to
[48:23] correct this you may hear even some
[48:26] popular preachers preaching this they
[48:28] say you see he broke the seven
[48:30] seal
[48:32] first because when he's breaking the
[48:34] first seal it doesn't say he broke read
[48:37] it there in your Bible you know what I'm
[48:39] talking about amen because I know some
[48:41] of you will never go home and read this
[48:54] revelation
[48:56] amen Revelation 6:1 what is this read
[49:00] here and I saw when the lamb opened one
[49:03] of the
[49:04] seals so now they put Revelation to it
[49:07] they put their own Revelation to it you
[49:09] see they say
[49:10] see it doesn't say open the first
[49:13] seal it says open one of the
[49:17] seals so meaning he broke the seven
[49:21] seal right but then the argument Falls
[49:24] flat when you go to Revelation chapter 8
[49:27] and there it says when he had opened the
[49:29] seven
[49:32] seal understand what I'm
[49:34] saying Revelation 61 says you open one
[49:37] of the seals right then you'll find
[49:40] Revelation 63 tells when he open the
[49:43] second seal then he goes third seal
[49:45] fourth seal fifth seal Sixth Seal then
[49:48] he comes to Revelation chapter8 and it
[49:50] says when he had opened the seven seal
[49:53] amen amen yes so 61 can't be the seven
[49:58] seal everybody understand am so when you
[50:01] hear somebody tell you that I'm showing
[50:02] you in the scripture that it's
[50:05] inaccurate amen hallelujah praise the
[50:09] Lord so yeah now the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:12] takes the
[50:13] book he reveals it in Revelation form in
[50:16] in symbol form and then now remember
[50:20] it's not different like the prophet
[50:22] would say I'm going to try and close now
[50:24] it's not like the prophet would
[50:27] say different people he says it's the
[50:30] same person changing form he says the
[50:33] book is not changing
[50:35] hands it's the person changing forms
[50:38] that's
[50:39] right amen hallelujah amen so he's
[50:42] changing form and we know
[50:46] now you got to tie in Daniel's Prophecy
[50:49] with this because he says in that
[50:51] day Michael shall deliver the names that
[50:54] are found in the book
[50:57] so who's Michael is an
[50:59] angel amen who's Michael Christ amen
[51:04] this is Prophet now yes amen you've been
[51:06] reading the message for all these years
[51:07] you know Michael is Christ yes amen
[51:10] hallelujah you know the Sevenfold amen
[51:13] Sevenfold Glory of his amen presence you
[51:16] know he reveals himself amen hallelujah
[51:19] you know about the seven spirits of God
[51:21] amen amen can you say Amen you know
[51:22] about all of these
[51:24] things so comes down now in Revelation
[51:28] 10 very important now Revelation 8 says
[51:31] when he had opened the seventh seal
[51:33] there was silence in heaven brother Bram
[51:35] says if you want to see the setting of
[51:37] Revelation 81 which is the seventh seal
[51:40] you'll find the setting found in
[51:42] Revelation 10 that's a quote the setting
[51:46] of it is found in Revelation 10 what do
[51:48] we find in Revelation 10 is that a
[51:51] mighty
[51:52] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[51:55] with a cloud amen amen am so can I say
[51:58] the mighty Angel is clothed with seven
[52:00] angels amen if we know what the cloud is
[52:04] come on now yes can I say that yes
[52:08] because the angel himself was his
[52:11] wig so we understand that so there's the
[52:15] mighty Angel come down clothed with a
[52:17] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[52:19] and his face was as it were the sun his
[52:21] feet tillers of fire very important now
[52:23] Yu's book and he had in his hand a
[52:26] little book open so the book is back on
[52:29] the earth amen yes amen I just showed
[52:33] you it was taken away Gone to Heaven
[52:37] Jesus Takes the book but now the book
[52:39] has come back to the Earth that's why we
[52:41] Rejoice amen the book titled deed to man
[52:44] in inheritance has come back to the
[52:46] Earth amen hallelujah now you can't live
[52:49] like they lived in the church
[52:51] ages oh thank you Lord the Holy Ghost is
[52:55] not outpouring himself in the
[52:56] manifestation of the gifts as in isza
[52:59] Street yes nether is moving through
[53:02] Sensations
[53:03] neither the Holy Ghost is not even
[53:06] moving right now amen hallelujah through
[53:08] just Angelic form but the Holy Ghost has
[53:11] now possessed a people amen the glory
[53:14] has come back to the Earth amen so what
[53:16] am I telling you the Cloud of Glory
[53:19] brought back man's inheritance to the
[53:21] Earth the mighty Angel has brought back
[53:24] your inheritance to the Earth so that
[53:26] you can be a son and daughter on the
[53:28] Earth again amen
[53:32] yes and he had in his hand a little book
[53:35] open and he set his right hand right
[53:38] foot upon the sea his left foot on the
[53:40] earth cried with a loud voice as when a
[53:43] lion
[53:44] Roth and when he cried seven Thunders
[53:47] uttered their
[53:49] voices right and when the seven Thunders
[53:51] had out their voices I was about to
[53:53] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[53:55] saying unto me seal up those things
[53:57] which the seven Thunders ated and write
[53:59] them not now you know we even read the
[54:02] quote on Sunday that he'll reveal the
[54:06] Mysteries contained in the seals The
[54:09] Mystery of the seven Thunders and it'll
[54:11] be these divinely revealed mystery
[54:14] truths that will literally turn the
[54:16] hearts of the children back to the faith
[54:17] of the fathers amen so people have tried
[54:20] to hpe up these things and tried to
[54:22] create a Doctrine around it but it was
[54:25] really the revelation of the word of God
[54:27] revealing all the mysteries of God
[54:29] giving us a faith in this hour that was
[54:31] the Thunders to awaken us amen oh yes
[54:35] but they tried to make it a special
[54:37] Doctrine and preach it in an
[54:39] intellectual way that people couldn't
[54:41] even understand what they were saying
[54:45] yes amen praise the Lord but it'll be
[54:48] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[54:51] that will do what fulfill Malachi 4:5
[54:54] and 6 amen turn our hearts back to the
[54:58] faith who brought this
[55:00] message Mighty Angel seven
[55:04] angels that's why we rejoicing at this
[55:07] time amen amen the book has been brought
[55:10] back to the Earth therefore you can't
[55:12] live a defeated life therefore now in
[55:15] this time in this season it's not like
[55:17] in the church ages it's not even the
[55:19] caliber of people that brother Bram was
[55:21] preaching to in his
[55:23] day come on now
[55:25] amen amen I just told you the Malachi 4

[55:54] trucks amen you need to excite yourself
[55:56] with these truths to say this is
[55:59] me thank you Lord
[56:03] amen amen but we can't
[56:07] get and we've seen this evident the
[56:09] truths can be taken away from us these
[56:11] truths can become you can Rejoice
[56:13] sometimes you rejoice around you for a
[56:15] while and then you get back weighed down
