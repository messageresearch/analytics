[4:03] Colossians chap 3 we'll read from verse
[4:05] one if he then be risen with
[4:11] Christ amen amen you see how God sees
[4:15] us amen as risen with Christ now there's
[4:20] a lot of things attached to that I can
[4:22] dwell on that right now but there's a
[4:24] lot of things with being risen with
[4:26] Christ because when he rose he was
[4:28] Victorious he had all things under his
[4:30] feet amen so in that he packed with
[4:32] Revelation right there that you are
[4:34] risen with Christ amen seek those things
[4:37] which are above amen so we can't be
[4:39] living carnal lives where Christ sth on
[4:42] the right hand of God now isn't that the
[4:44] believer's position in Christ in
[4:46] Ephesians amen so he's saying seek those
[4:49] things set your affection on things
[4:52] above because where your treasure is
[4:54] that's where your heart will be so he's
[4:56] saying set your affection on things
[4:57] above not on things on the earth amen
[5:01] for you are
[5:03] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[5:06] God amen amen amen when Christ who is
[5:11] our life shall appear then shall he also
[5:15] appear with him in glory who's our life
[5:18] amen Christ is our life amen amen it's
[5:22] no longer I that liveth but Christ that
[5:25] liveth in me and the faith I have is not
[5:28] my own faith but faith of the Son of God
[5:31] is in me now amen
[5:34] hallelujah amen the Lord had blessings
[5:36] to the reading of his word you may be
[5:37] seated when Christ who is our life shall
[5:41] appear then shall he also appear with
[5:43] him in glory praise the Lord praise the
[5:46] Lord amen John 141 our lord Jesus now
[5:50] John 14:1 is following John 13 remember
[5:53] it was one continuous conversation they
[5:55] were having from when Jesus was telling
[5:57] Peter he was going to deny him and then
[6:01] he was telling Peter this and then he
[6:02] goes straight into John 14 because they
[6:05] were not troubled with what Jesus was
[6:06] telling them that Peter was going to
[6:08] deny him so their hearts were troubled
[6:11] then Jesus says let not your heart be
[6:15] troubled you believe in God believe also
[6:18] in
[6:20] me now we are in the season reaching
[6:23] maturity reaching full
[6:26] Harvest I want you to read between the

[6:52] the Bride is a Ministry of healing amen
[6:54] but it's got to take a people who will
[6:56] believe that
[6:57] Ministry amen John 66 3 says it is the
[7:01] spirit that quickeneth the flesh proth
[7:04] nothing but the words that I speak unto
[7:07] you they are spirit and they are life
[7:09] amen meaning that the words coming out
[7:11] of this bride's body is a mature word
[7:14] amen is a word of maturity amen it's a
[7:17] word where their word is backed
[7:19] up this is not a lam word spoken their
[7:23] word carries Authority so I say unto you

[8:46] unless he is called of God Amen would
[8:49] they were to equip people and bring them
[8:50] to rapturing Faith

[16:48] dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him
[16:53] Hallelujah whose names are not written
[16:55] in the Book of Life of the lamb slain
[16:58] from the foundation of the earth of the
[17:00] world so where is it coming to the
[17:06] worship how do the Rebellion start in
[17:09] heaven
[17:10] worship how does it end worship didn't
[17:14] Jesus tell the woman at the well John 4
[17:18] the father is seeking
[17:20] those whose names are in the book
[17:23] Because when the names are in the book
[17:24] amen it declares their freedom declares
[17:27] their Deliverance so the father is
[17:29] seeking those that will
[17:31] worship in spirit and in truth so the
[17:34] only time you can truly Worship in
[17:36] spirit and in truth is if you see your

[17:59] they ought to be in
[18:00] Hallelujah you know when the 24 Elders
[18:03] were I'm using it this way where I don't
[18:05] want to say the word amen you may get me
[18:07] wrong but they were confined to Heaven
[18:09] 24 Elders around the throne and they
[18:12] knew they can't return back to the
[18:14] Earth no one who departs from this life
[18:17] can return back to the Earth prior to
[18:19] Jesus coming
[18:20] in taking the Book of Life
[18:24] back so the 24 Elders knew they couldn't
[18:26] come back to the Earth amen
[18:29] part of the 24 Elders was the 12
[18:33] disciples amen yes praise the Lord yes
[18:40] so they know they can't come back to the
[18:42] Earth so they you can see the the time
[18:46] changes there in heaven when John is
[18:48] weeping John is weeping and he's
[18:50] representing all mankind the Bride of
[18:52] Jesus Christ that we want to get back to
[18:56] the Earth
[18:57] amen but we can't but Earth is our
[19:01] domain Earth is our
[19:03] home but we can't get back there when
[19:06] the spirit leaves his body so there's a
[19:09] cry there's a
[19:10] weeping but they identify the the line
[19:14] of the tribe of Judah and they say he is
[19:16] the one who
[19:17] prevails amen he's the king yes the lion
[19:21] is the king I want you to know that the
[19:24] first announcement that was given is
[19:26] that where is he born King who are these
[19:29] people who are studying the first Bible
[19:32] they saw something in the heavens that
[19:34] made him King they didn't come asking
[19:36] where is the Lamb of God who takes away
[19:39] the sin of the world no they were asking
[19:42] where is the king amen amen amen
[19:46] hallelujah they must have seen amen they
[19:48] must have seen the constellation of Leo
[19:52] Hallelujah they must have seen amen and
[19:54] he was connected with that yes
[19:56] Hallelujah and and he came and asked
[19:59] where is he born King of the Jews and
[20:01] the angels made sure they were present
[20:03] at his birth and they presented
[20:05] themselves to a to shepherds in the
[20:07] field and this was no ordinary child yes
[20:11] amen amen God was going to do things a
[20:13] legal way if God had come and redeemed
[20:16] man any other way except through man it
[20:19] would have been an illegal way because
[20:22] the book was lost because man's
[20:24] inheritance was lost by a man it had to
[20:27] be regained by a man yes but God won't
[20:31] do anything that will violate his own
[20:33] word so God must work according to his
[20:35] own law God must work according to his
[20:38] own law Amen to his own word so he's got
[20:41] to inject himself into the human race
[20:44] he's got to create a body for himself

[21:39] word but through the
[21:42] fall amen all of other mankind came the
[21:46] illegitimate
[21:47] way amen but Jesus didn't come that way
[21:51] amen Jesus came as a spoken word seed

[21:57] and bear a son amen the same thing Adam
[21:59] was supposed to do to Eve was say Eve

[22:57] denominational world Amen praise the
[23:02] Lord they believe it ended at the at the
[23:05] resurrection amen praise the Lord but
[23:08] there's a further work to do beyond the
[23:10] resurrection he's resurrecting for a
[23:14] reason otherwise he would have
[23:16] established his kingdom you know after
[23:18] Jesus resurrected no one could kill
[23:21] him he's in a glorified
[23:24] body they couldn't have killed him if he
[23:27] chose to remain on the Earth he could
[23:28] have remained on the Earth but you know
[23:30] what the problem would have been he
[23:32] alone would have been
[23:34] living Generations would have been dying
[23:37] and he alone would be
[23:39] alive in a body that doesn't age
[23:43] hallelujah amen come on
[23:46] now I'm stretching you thinking you now
[23:49] amen he alone would have been alive but
[23:52] his purpose of coming was to redeem

[23:57] you must get back to heaven where the
[23:58] book is he's after the book He's after
[24:01] the names in the book so that's why when
[24:04] he
[24:05] resurrects he goes back to
[24:07] Heaven because there's one seated on the
[24:10] throne that's got the
[24:12] book and God the father is not giving
[24:15] God the son the
[24:16] book it's the same one taking the book
[24:18] from
[24:19] [Music]
[24:21] himself it's the flesh God taking the
[24:25] book from Spirit God yes amen
[24:30] amen amen
[24:32] hallelujah there's no when you reading
[24:34] the book when you're reading the
[24:36] Revelation 5 there there's a lamb taking
[24:38] the book there's no lamb there on woles
[24:40] that's going there bleedy bloody lamb
[24:42] taking the
[24:45] book the book is not changing
[24:49] ANS the one holding the book is changing
[24:53] form amen praise the Lord amen so God
[24:59] worked according to his own law and
[25:02] injected his seed into the human race
[25:04] amen hallelujah now amen there's a God
[25:07] man now there's a God man amen on the
[25:10] earth praise the Lord you know this our
[25:14] Lord Jesus
[25:15] amen demon powers recognized
[25:19] him amen demon powers recognize his name
[25:24] yes you know there yes something about
[25:27] your name right
[25:29] right praise the lord we know there's
[25:31] something about your name but your
[25:35] name I want to speak something about
[25:37] your name here
[25:39] now amen praise the
[25:44] Lord your name carries power how many of
[25:48] you know that amen amen your name
[25:51] carries
[25:53] power your name carries an inheritance
[26:00] there's something about a
[26:02] name we sing that song it's the life
[26:05] behind that
[26:07] name amen so your name carries a
[26:11] life if you had no life you'll have no
[26:15] name you don't believe me the moment
[26:19] life leaves the
[26:21] body they call them dead you'll never
[26:24] find anyone referring and ask them what
[26:26] time Michael is coming today when they
[26:28] going to they're asking about the casket
[26:31] when they're asking about the
[26:32] undertakers bringing your body they
[26:35] don't ask what time uh Maru is
[26:38] coming ask what time is the body coming
[26:42] as soon as life leaves the body you
[26:43] become nameless yes
[26:50] yes so behind every name is a
[26:53] [Music]
[26:54] life amen praise the Lord and a life
[26:58] carries an inheritance amen a life
[27:01] carries a certain amount of
[27:03] authority but the life must reach a
[27:06] stage of maturity because brother Bram
[27:09] is telling us that when a son comes to
[27:11] maturity when he comes to adoption then
[27:14] the father takes him to an adoption
[27:16] ceremony and he transfers all of his
[27:18] rights to the son meaning the son now
[27:22] has the same signing Powers the same
[27:25] name as his father amen
[27:28] thank you Lord amen so ask yourself a
[27:31] question when Jesus is saying in my
[27:34] name he's talking about a time when
[27:37] adopted Sons will come to
[27:41] maturity in the season of adoption in
[27:44] the season of
[27:45] maturity amen when they can carry my
[27:48] name in my name means they are in my
[27:51] character they in my likeness the father
[27:53] is well pleased with you amen you have
[27:55] come to the Statue of a perfect man PR
[27:58] the Lord amen hallelujah you know even
[28:01] the demon powers when they looked at
[28:04] Jesus they were able to identify him how
[28:07] many if you know that amen the demon
[28:09] powers were able to identify Jesus I
[28:12] just want to pick it up for you very
[28:13] quickly here amen praise the
[28:15] Lord
[28:25] amen praise the Lord
[28:35] sorry the thought just come to me now
[28:37] and I need to find it amen for you
[28:38] quickly amen so Matthew
[28:45] 20 okay let's go to Mark 1 I think Mark
[28:48] 1 is a better one because it's got quite
[28:49] a few there amen let's go to Mark
[28:54] 1 Mark 1:23 says as and there was in the
[28:58] synagogue a man with an unclean spirit
[29:01] and he cried out so an unclean spirit is
[29:04] a demon power but the power is crying
[29:07] out saying let us alone what have we to
[29:09] do with thee thou Jesus of Nazareth are
[29:12] Thou come to destroy us I Know Thee who
[29:15] Thou Art the Holy One Of God Amen demon
[29:19] powers can recognize you amen and Jesus
[29:23] rebuked him saying hold thy peace and
[29:25] come out of him amen and when the
[29:28] unclean Spirit had torn him and cried
[29:30] with a loud voice he came out of him and
[29:33] they were all amazed in so much they
[29:34] questioned among themselves saying what
[29:36] thing is
[29:40] this what new doctrine is this you see
[29:44] notice there now don't don't move too
[29:46] quickly they had never seen somebody
[29:48] like this that they called him a
[29:54] thing they never seen a man operate like
[29:57] this amen
[30:00] yes they thought him if he was living in
[30:03] today's day they would have thought he
[30:04] was a
[30:06] alien amen so they ask what thing is
[30:10] this is it in your Bible there what
[30:13] thing is
[30:15] this they had never seen a man in this
[30:18] Authority he's walking and demon powers
[30:20] are manifesting and saying I know who
[30:22] you are why they were worshiping him in
[30:25] another form yes when he was Elohim
[30:27] there with the angels amen these same
[30:29] demon powers were worshiping so they
[30:31] recognized his presence and when you
[30:34] carry his presence amen demon powers
[30:36] recognize who you
[30:38] are praise the
[30:40] [Music]
[30:41] Lord hallelujah so if demon powers are
[30:44] not running from you if they like to be
[30:46] around you watch watch your spirit amen
[30:49] praise the Lord yes what thing is this
[30:53] what new doctrine is this for with
[30:56] authority commanded he even the unclean
[30:59] spirits and they do obey him amen Jesus
[31:02] was a man who knew what the word said
[31:04] about him how about you and I we should
[31:07] be people who know what the word says
[31:09] about us we should be able to believe
[31:12] all that the word says about us and when
[31:14] we speak we speak with authority we
[31:17] shouldn't suggest to the devil that he
[31:19] leaves we should speak with authority
[31:21] that he must
[31:23] live amen thank you Lord amen praise the
[31:27] Lord
[31:32] hallelujah amen so we're coming to a
[31:35] time in season now amen where the life
[31:37] is on display amen hallelujah a critical
[31:42] season the life is on display so he said
[31:44] the name carries Authority the name
[31:46] carries
[31:48] power
[31:50] amen do you know the name carries a
[31:53] presence Jesus said where two or more
[31:56] are gathered in my name I will be in the
[31:58] midst so the name carries a presence

[32:21] cold cup of
[32:24] water he says those who do good to the
[32:26] bride they won't lose their reward amen
[32:29] so names carry rewards am Jesus is
[32:32] saying whosoever receives a little one
[32:35] in my name receiveth me amen he's saying
[32:38] we two or more are gathered together in
[32:40] my name I am there in my their midst
[32:42] amen this is what Jesus is saying I'm
[32:44] showing you the name carries a life and

[49:49] mouth Yes
[49:51] amen hallelujah
[49:54] amen amen so the random says that Adam
[49:59] when God created Adam in His image and
[50:01] after his likeness he was a seed of the
[50:04] word amen we find that quote seed of the
[50:07] word in church ages he was a seed of the
[50:10] word that's who Adam was seed of the
[50:13] word So Adam was a seed of the word but
[50:19] MDC took it
[50:21] further amen the first time we read
[50:23] about his spoken word son is Adam the
[50:26] next time we find somebody it's
[50:30] mesic
[50:33] Amen we come to John one in the
[50:35] beginning was the word and the Word was
[50:36] with God and the Word was God so first
[50:39] we got the seed of the word that's in
[50:40] the image and likeness seed of the word
[50:43] then Genesis 14 we come to MDC who is
[50:45] not the seed of the word but he is the
[50:47] word himself amen is God himself in the
[50:51] theophonic
[50:52] body amen praise the
[50:55] Lorden now we see that malaz is there
[50:58] it's showing you the maturity of the
[51:01] word if Adam had
[51:05] remained in his State before the fall he
[51:07] would have matured to that kingly
[51:10] position oh I pray you get me
[51:13] tonight Adam couldn't have remained a
[51:15] seed of the word only
[51:17] yes his seed would have matured yes and
[51:20] he would have come into his kingly
[51:22] position like
[51:23] MDC amen
[51:26] right you see you got to think deep now
[51:29] when God this is God now saying let us
[51:31] make man in our image and after our
[51:33] likeness yes the same one is now coming
[51:36] in the form of
[51:38] mesic so he would have had to mature to
[51:40] mesic State yes because he was made in
[51:44] the image and likeness of MDC amen
[51:48] yes praise the Lord amen amen so if he
[51:53] had remained in that state he would have
[51:54] become king therefore m was called King
[51:57] of
[51:58] Salem amen king of righteousness no
[52:01] beginning of days no ending of days he's
[52:04] the Eternal King had to be God himself
[52:07] Amen in a theopen body and that's the
[52:09] mature state of the
[52:11] word amen that means if sin had not
[52:14] interrupted the picture the seed of God
[52:17] the seed of the word in Adam was
[52:18] supposed to grow and become mature and
[52:20] become like mesic M because mesic is the
[52:24] mature state of the word coming into
[52:26] perfection that's when the word comes
[52:27] into Perfection can be placed as king
[52:30] and let have
[52:31] dominion so from the seed word you got
[52:34] to grow and become the matured word now

[52:40] word you've got to mature and grow amen
