[2:54] was on Earth at that time and the woman
[2:56] knew that she could get to Jesus amen if
[2:59] she could just touch the am of His
[3:00] Garment amen so praise the Lord we'll
[3:02] turn to our scripture reading this
[3:04] morning amen let's start reading in
[3:15] ook amen ook chapter
[3:23] 2 and verse
[3:25] two and the Lord answered me and said
[3:28] write the vision
[3:31] and make it plain upon tables amen
[3:36] amen is everybody in here
[3:39] yet
[3:42] amen I don't want anyone to miss the
[3:44] message so whoever needs to come into
[3:45] the service please come in
[3:49] amen we come to church we must be in the
[3:52] church amen we don't have overflow yet
[3:55] amen hallelujah the only overflow is for
[3:57] the mothers and the children praise the
[4:00] Lord what does the Bible say and the
[4:02] Lord answered me and said write the
[4:07] vision and make it plain upon tables
[4:11] yes that he may run that reth it oh yes
[4:15] so it mustn't be written in a mysterious
[4:17] form it must be written in simple
[4:19] language so the one that's reading it
[4:22] can run with a vision amen amen
[4:25] hallelujah praise the Lord amen for the
[4:28] vision is yet for an appointed time but
[4:31] at the end it shall speak and not lie
[4:35] though it
[4:36] t wait for it
[4:39] amen
[4:41] amen wait for
[4:44] it because it will surely come amen
[4:50] yes it will not
[4:52] car amen praise the Lord so notice the
[4:55] emphasis there on those words amen
[4:58] praise the Lord and then our many
[4:59] portion of scripture we're going to read
[5:00] is John 8:31 amen praise the
[5:05] Lord John
[5:12] 8:31 then Jesus said to those Jews who
[5:16] believed on him if you continue in my
[5:19] word then are you my disciples
[5:22] indeed and you shall know the truth and
[5:25] the truth shall set you free amen you
[5:28] may be seated to the Lord at blessing to
[5:29] the reading of his word you leave that
[5:31] scripture up there amen hallelujah let's
[5:34] go back to that verse 31
[5:40] amen i' like to speak on continue in
[5:43] patience amen continue in
[5:50] patience to see the Promise come to pass
[5:54] amen amen amen
[5:58] hallelujah then Jesus said to those
[6:01] Jews who believed on him so this message
[6:06] is coming just to
[6:09] Believers don't miss the details of this
[6:11] verse now Jesus is talking to Believers
[6:14] he's not talking to the scribes and the
[6:16] Pharisees and everybody else Jesus
[6:19] talking to the Jews who believed on him
[6:22] and he's telling them if you continue in
[6:27] my in my what word in my word then I
[6:32] hear my disciples indeed amen amen so we
[6:38] got to ask ourselves are we continuing
[6:40] in the word amen when we are facing how
[6:44] are we let me ask you a question like
[6:46] this how are you facing your daily
[6:48] trials your battles your situations in
[6:50] life how are you overcoming
[6:53] it amen how are you overcoming your
[6:58] trials how are are you navigating
[7:00] through your stress and all of these
[7:03] things that come upon
[7:06] us amen the key is the word of God Amen
[7:11] and Jesus Is Telling those that believe
[7:13] on him are we the ones that believe on
[7:15] Jesus amen he says if you continue in my
[7:18] word amen amen meaning you must have
[7:21] patience to continue amen continue in my
[7:26] word then I he my disciples what is a
[7:30] disciple a follower of Christ the one
[7:33] that wants to follow the teachings of
[7:34] Jesus Christ another word is a
[7:38] devote a one who is devoted to the Lord
[7:40] Jesus Christ if you continue in my word
[7:43] yes notice he's not saying if you just
[7:45] come to
[7:47] church
[7:49] amen he's not saying if you only do a
[7:51] particular thing he instruction is
[7:54] specific if you continue in my
[7:57] word then I am my disciples indeed so
[8:01] how is our study of scripture is it just
[8:03] casual is it just like uh whatever verse
[8:07] pops up today I will read that or is our
[8:10] study of the word
[8:12] intentional because the word can
[8:14] liberate us from every situation amen
[8:18] the word is key and it's the answer to
[8:20] all our problems amen
[8:23] amen amen now we just read abuk 2:2 it's
[8:28] telling you though it car wait for it
[8:31] amen it must come to pass now we can't
[8:35] be wavering in our faith we must be
[8:38] consistent in our faith when is it we
[8:41] were speaking about having a rod VI
[8:43] Faith a rod Vier when it locks its jaw
[8:46] you can't open it you can hit it on its
[8:49] head or do anything once it grips it
[8:52] will not release it will not open up its
[8:55] mouth let your faith be like
[8:58] that amen don't be despondent when you
[9:01] see things not coming to
[9:04] pass amen when you see things not
[9:07] working out according to your
[9:10] timeline God wants to work amen Faith
[9:13] work with patience amen amen God is
[9:16] testing if you really believe him or you
[9:18] just want to see the reward of what you
[9:21] want oh I'll continue in the word until
[9:24] I get my healing and then I'll forget
[9:26] about the word I'll continue in the word
[9:28] until I get the desire of my heart then
[9:30] I'll forget about the word you know it's
[9:33] human nature that way we start something
[9:36] for a while and then we back off today
[9:38] we wake up hey right I'm ready to lose
[9:40] weight I got my exercise program I got
[9:43] my diet program give it a week give it
[9:45] two weeks give it 3 weeks and then what
[9:49] happens we forget about it then we goone
[9:52] on back to the whole slam
[9:55] amen but if you continue say you were
[9:58] continuing and you had a goal that you
[10:00] were going to lose a certain amount of
[10:01] weight if you had continued in
[10:03] patience and applied the diet and
[10:06] applied the exercise
[10:08] program would you see the
[10:11] results so if we can apply these things
[10:14] in the natural if somebody is studying
[10:16] something maybe the degree is three or
[10:18] four years if they continue in
[10:21] patience if they continue and and and
[10:24] dedicate themselves to study will they
[10:26] see the result at the end of the four
[10:28] years they will certainly see the result
[10:31] so if in the natural we can be
[10:33] persistent to achieve Natural Things how
[10:36] much more should we in the spiritual be
[10:38] persistent to achieve spiritual things
[10:41] amen sometimes I feel like we are more
[10:44] committed to physical things and we put
[10:46] so much of time and effort and energy
[10:48] into physical things amen and what we
[10:50] want to achieve physically and less
[10:55] spiritually amen so sometimes you got to
[10:57] ask yourself what is the matter with man
[11:00] why is he so casual when it comes to
[11:02] serving God Amen Hallelujah John 177
[11:07] says this if you want to know what is
[11:09] truth now because Jesus had told him you
[11:11] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[11:13] set you free in John
[11:15] 17:17 Jesus is telling them sanctify
[11:18] them through the truth Thy word is
[11:23] truth amen so if you're going to
[11:25] continue in the word like what Jesus is
[11:27] saying he means you must continue in
[11:30] truth now a truth can be a partial Truth
[11:33] for a certain amount of time but then
[11:35] when God is moving on to further the
[11:37] truth you got to move with
[11:39] truth Luther's light was
[11:42] truth but there was a
[11:46] continuation we can't say we are
[11:47] remaining in truth with Luther's
[11:49] light we needed to progress to Wesley's
[11:52] light sanctification then we needed to
[11:55] progress to the baptism of the Holy
[11:57] Ghost amen and now we have coming into
[11:59] the formed word image of the Son of God
[12:02] amen amen now the word is coming to full
[12:04] fruition in our lives yes amen you say
[12:08] what are you talking about simplify it
[12:09] for me when I see you when I see my
[12:12] brother and when I see my sister I must
[12:14] see Jesus on display I must see the life
[12:17] of Jesus on display amen yes Lord yes
[12:21] Lord amen
[12:23] hallelujah Jesus thought it not robbery
[12:26] to be equal with God why was possible
[12:29] because all that was in God according to
[12:31] Christ yes the
[12:33] end
[12:35] no yes so if Jesus thoughted not
[12:41] robbery to be equal with God because all
[12:44] that was in God he pour into Christ now
[12:46] all that was in Christ he pour into the
[12:48] church now can you come into your
[12:50] position and say you thought it not
[12:52] robbery to be equal with Christ amen we
[12:56] are HS of the father joint with the
[13:00] son amen amen amen
[13:04] hallelujah let's go to Hebrews 6 And1 12
[13:07] we'll lay the scriptures amen and then
[13:09] we'll continue in our
[13:10] sermon Hebrews 6:12 says that you be not
[13:18] slothful
[13:20] amen don't be slothful when it comes to
[13:22] the things of God but followers of
[13:25] them who through faith and patience s
[13:29] what they
[13:31] do through faith and what patience
[13:36] patience yeah but I gave the Lord a
[13:38] timeline I told him it's got to be
[13:43] now
[13:45] amen God is Not serving us in our
[13:48] kingdom we are serving God in his
[13:51] kingdom and the reason why he's got you
[13:54] in this holding period of maybe 25 years
[13:58] maybe 20 years in this wait 430 years in
[14:02] this waiting period is for
[14:05] what because he wrote the
[14:07] vision and according to his word you see
[14:10] Malachi 4: 5 and 6 behold I sent you
[14:13] Elijah the prophet was laying in
[14:15] scripture the vision was
[14:18] written but until the appointed time we
[14:21] had to wait for it yes it couldn't have
[14:24] been in 1900 19001 19002
[14:29] no but in
[14:31] 196 yes amen was the Fulfillment of that
[14:34] Vision amen amen God had to have a man
[14:37] on the
[14:38] earth praise the Lord so we through
[14:42] faith and patience inherit the promise
[14:45] amen why I'm telling you that amen
[14:48] because you have worked your faith up to
[14:50] a level where you can believe God for
[14:52] all things to be possible but then you
[14:54] don't have the patience to wait and then
[14:56] what happens when the person is not in p
[14:59] patience his faith wavers and he loses
[15:02] out on the promise of
[15:05] God abuk 2 says though it t wait for
[15:09] it amen the beginning of the year we ask
[15:12] so many of you to write things down some
[15:14] of you may have written amen some of you
[15:17] may have written it on your mind amen
[15:20] and that's where it will remain
[15:22] Hallelujah because God had thoughts and
[15:25] as long as it remain thoughts nothing
[15:27] happened on the Earth
[15:29] God had to take the thoughts and speak
[15:31] it amen that's the law on the earth amen
[15:36] hallelujah now James 1: 2 and 3 says
[15:38] this my brethren count it all
[15:43] joy now you say but I'm going through a
[15:45] trial I'm going through patience I'm
[15:47] going through sickness I'm going through
[15:48] tribulation you saying I must count it
[15:50] all
[15:54] joy knowing this that the trying of your
[15:57] faith work
[16:01] patience
[16:03] amen because when faith is built up to a
[16:06] level you can get excited in the service
[16:08] you can say okay I'm speaking I'm
[16:09] speaking I'm
[16:10] speaking you spoke the word it went
[16:13] forth but remember the word will not
[16:15] return void it's going to come back to
[16:18] you how is it coming back in
[16:20] multiplication we are in the kingdom of
[16:22] God and we serve God by multiplication
[16:24] amen so the king the word is coming back
[16:27] pressed down shaken together running
[16:30] over so the trying of your faith worketh
[16:35] patience I don't like
[16:39] patience people don't like patience you
[16:42] know why we live in a society where
[16:44] everything is
[16:45] instant everything is instant amen you
[16:49] know back in the day you could tell
[16:51] somebody you know what we need to buy
[16:53] this and we're going to save towards it
[16:55] now that takes patience now people don't
[16:58] want to wait and save what they do Quick
[17:02] Fix they go take a loan that they can't
[17:05] pay and they put themselves in
[17:08] debt
[17:10] amen

[17:17] about Elisha the one who can raise all
[17:19] debts amen if you missed the sermon too

[17:47] here

[17:54] that with your mouth amen and how is he
[17:56] doing it the Lord is giving in wisdom

[29:57] when it was going to rain he never set

[30:05] what did Noah have to do continue in the
[30:09] word by faith through patience Noah had
[30:13] to continue in the word Noah had to stay
[30:16] focused and faithful to the purpose for
[30:18] which God had called him amen Noah knew
[30:21] that he was going to see it in his
[30:24] generation amen hallelujah and Noah was
[30:28] ready to go into the H anytime God said
[30:30] go into the H how are we living Our

[32:13] now you bringing the tea I was busy
[32:16] changing the baby's
[32:18] nappes
[32:20] now amen so we must remain I'm I'm
[32:23] trying to get through this year here
[32:24] what the prophet says we got to wait
[32:26] patient right in this first quote here
[32:28] in the trial 107 he says he never said
[32:32] as soon as you lay hands on the sick
[32:34] they're going to jump up and run around
[32:35] the floor like the skeptic wants to make
[32:38] you think he said they shall recover
[32:42] amen he never said when they
[32:45] will he said the prayer of faith shall
[32:47] save the sick in James 5 ver14 God shall
[32:51] raise him up when he didn't say he just
[32:54] said he
[32:56] would
[32:58] amen amen yeah in 109 he says Mark 16 he
[33:02] said so the prophet is really one
[33:04] quoting Mark 11:23 how do we know it we
[33:06] should know the scripture of bahad right
[33:08] but he's saying he said say to this
[33:11] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[33:14] your heart but believe what you have
[33:15] said will come to pass he didn't say
[33:18] when he said it would yes
[33:21] Hallelujah so what you need to do when
[33:23] you speak that word and you speak to the
[33:25] mountain you need to go rejoicing you
[33:27] need to have joy because you know the
[33:28] end result what's the end result the
[33:30] mountain has moved so I'm rejoicing
[33:33] night and
[33:34] day amen thanking God thanking God
[33:38] hallelujah amen I was once blind can now
[33:41] see amen hallelujah amen thank you
[33:46] Lord amen hallelujah you get people who
[33:50] are Skeptics tell you let me see you
[33:51] make this man walk amen he's been in a
[33:53] wheelchair long time amen he said he's
[33:55] got faith you see the the prophet says
[33:57] that's the
[33:58] devil skeptic coming Jesus never said
[34:01] amen they jump up right away he says
[34:03] amen that's what people want an instant
[34:06] amen he said amen if they believe they
[34:09] would get well they shall
[34:11] recover it depends what prayer you're
[34:14] praying if you're applying Mark 16 you
[34:16] will see Mark 16
[34:19] results if you're applying Mark 11:23
[34:22] you'll see Mark 11:23
[34:24] results if you're applying Mark 9 23
[34:27] you'll see Mark 9:23
[34:29] results amen praise the
[34:32] Lord you know what happens we've been
[34:35] explaining to this to you through the
[34:37] months there's spiritual warfare going
[34:39] on
[34:41] yes and Rafa can't always get to
[34:49] you if you if you only knew the Angelic
[34:51] world and now it
[34:53] operates
[34:54] amen because sometimes you know you know
[34:57] God is
[34:59] omnipresent amen but he can only be at
[35:02] one place at one time and how does he
[35:04] how is he omnipresent through his
[35:05] omnicient because he knows all things
[35:08] amen hallelujah but God is a physical
[35:11] being he can be at one place at one time
[35:14] amen hallelujah so say for now for
[35:17] example now you are sitting here and you
[35:19] got afraid to believe God for something
[35:20] right now yes you're saying Lord I
[35:22] believe you I receive it right now I
[35:24] receive
[35:25] it now he's going to connect with your
[35:29] faith but maybe
[35:32] Gyra what I'm saying there are seven
[35:34] compound names is Jehovah Gyra Jehovah
[35:37] Rafa Jehovah
[35:39] Shalom there's so many people amen that
[35:43] are praying to God
[35:45] Amen and God sends his angels as
[35:48] ministering
[35:50] Spirits now you can receive this or not
[35:53] yes amen but that's how the angel of the
[35:56] Lord came into the prophet's meeting
[35:58] amen so the angel why would he why
[36:00] couldn't he just pray before the angel
[36:03] came why would he say you know I'm
[36:05] waiting for somebody yes amen praise the
[36:09] Lord amen what am I trying to tell you
[36:11] why didn't Daniel receive his promise
[36:14] immediately there was a spiritual
[36:15] warfare going on these angels are caught
[36:18] up in Warfare and the prayer sometimes
[36:20] may not be answered immediately but
[36:22] maybe they'll come the next day or two
[36:25] yes yes and coming to see if you are
[36:27] still continuing in faith oh yes Lord
[36:31] amen continuing in patience continuing
[36:34] in the what w r d yes continuing in the
[36:38] word oh thank amen imagine when the
[36:41] angel comes 2 days later and there you
[36:44] busy with your own thing gone back to
[36:47] your old ways your faith was only
[36:49] between 10 and 12 on a Sunday
[36:53] morning 5 12 you saying goodbye friend
[36:59] I stay no longer with
[37:02] you goodbye
[37:06] patience you'll see 5+ 12 on the way
[37:09] home you'll see how many people being
[37:11] patients or
[37:14] not hey you didn't even press the push
[37:17] button put the air corn
[37:19] on you didn't start the car
[37:23] yet now you're following speed distance
[37:27] I mean they're saying they're
[37:32] angry
[37:34] patience continue in patience why I'm
[37:37] saying these things you can't suddenly
[37:39] have patience in one aspect of your life
[37:41] and be impatient the rest of your
[37:43] aspects patience is a thing that's
[37:46] developed amen last week we were talking
[37:48] about character the prophet says the
[37:50] only thing you will take to Heaven is
[37:51] your character right amen amen and we
[37:54] were showing you how the word is molding
[37:56] your character so if the word which is
[37:58] an eternal word molds your character
[38:00] into the image of Christ then your
[38:01] character which is able to live on this
[38:03] Earth is the same character that can
[38:05] live in that Earth in that
[38:07] heaven that's why you don't change your
[38:09] character but you must come into the
[38:11] character of Jesus amen hallelujah
[38:14] praise the
[38:15] Lord so amen you think of Abraham we've
[38:18] been through Noah you think of Abraham
[38:21] God told him he was going to have a son
[38:22] through his wife Sarah she was 65 at
[38:26] that time Abraham was 75 they had no
[38:28] sign of children or whom was dead amen
[38:31] after 28 days came nothing happened to
[38:34] Sarah they laughed and made fun of
[38:36] Abraham amen the first year came they
[38:38] laughed and made fun of him they asked
[38:39] him how many children you got now you
[38:41] told us the Lord told you you're going
[38:43] to have a son how many children you got
[38:44] now but the Bible says Abraham staggered
[38:47] not at the promise of God Amen but was
[38:50] strong in
[38:53] faith now remember from
[38:57] 75 to 100 was his body getting weaker or
[39:03] stronger come on now physically was his
[39:06] body getting weaker or
[39:08] stronger his body was getting strong
[39:11] weaker but what was getting stronger his
[39:14] faith was getting
[39:17] stronger so year after year his faith
[39:20] grew stronger all the time because he
[39:22] believed that God was able to keep his
[39:23] word and he was focused on God's purpose
[39:27] so one day amen hallelujah while he's
[39:29] sitting there and he's maybe talking to
[39:31] Sarah because she's in the tent behind
[39:33] him the angel of the Lord comes to him
[39:36] amen 25 years pass he's old he's stoop
[39:40] shouldered Sarah could hardly get around
[39:43] herself amen Sarah was 90 years
[39:48] old but as soon as they met the angel of
[39:51] the Lord the prophet of God says the
[39:52] very next day his shoulders started to
[39:54] straighten out he no longer was walking
[39:57] as a unpack man his shoulders started to
[40:00] straighten out amen the Bible the
[40:03] prophet tells us that his air started to
[40:06] go back to
[40:09] black you can see I'm having a body
[40:11] change
[40:14] slowly
[40:16] amen Sarah's cheeks became
[40:20] red Sarah started to look young again
[40:24] beautiful again amen
[40:26] hallelujah praise the Lord and they
[40:30] started to turn back to a young man and
[40:32] woman again amen now the prophet says
[40:35] that God hides his messages in between
[40:36] the lines because you can't go to a
[40:39] seminary school to learn that Abraham
[40:40] and Sarah turned back young again that's
[40:43] right that's right it's only this
[40:45] Prophet that told us that oh yes right
[40:47] so hear what he says he says my wife
[40:50] this is now
[40:51] in Amen in the paragraph the 120 my wife
[40:55] when she writes writes me a letter I can
[40:57] read between the lines I know what she's
[41:00] talking about cuz I love her I know her
[41:03] nature I know what she means she's
[41:05] writing I'm sitting here tonight Billy
[41:06] the children are in bed I'm thinking of
[41:08] you I know what she's meaning cuz I love
[41:11] her you see then he says if you in love
[41:14] with God and God's spirit is in you the
[41:16] Holy Spirit himself is The Interpreter
[41:19] of this word amen amen so he's laying
[41:22] this now to show us the hidden Mystery
[41:25] between this so he says in order to get
[41:27] that baby a whom was dead a Liv stream
[41:30] was dead he would have to make a mother
[41:32] another
[41:34] home
[41:36] yes he gave Sarah another home amen what
[41:40] would he have to do you see they didn't
[41:42] have any bottles they stick in the
[41:44] baby's mouth so the mother can run
[41:45] around everywhere them days it had to be
[41:48] a wet mother meaning a breastfeeding
[41:50] mother right so in order to do that the
[41:53] milk veins was dried up so he would have
[41:56] to make new milk veins
[42:00] yes to feed the baby and another thing a
[42:03] woman under years old going into
[42:06] labor what you would have to give her he
[42:09] would have to give her a new heart oh
[42:11] yes Lord amen amen see he didn't just
[42:15] Patch It Up
[42:17] hallelujah our god don't believe in
[42:20] patch jobs when he healed he really
[42:23] healed amen ask brother Joshua when he
[42:26] heals he really heals oh yes thank you
[42:30] Lord amen amen
[42:33] hallelujah so but after 25 years the
[42:36] baby com in on the scene it happened God
[42:38] didn't say you're going to have the baby
[42:40] next week by Sarah he never designated
[42:43] any
[42:45] time he said he would have a baby by
[42:47] Sarah he never said when he just said he
[42:51] would he showed in him what he's going
[42:54] to do to all Abraham seed they'll turn
[42:57] back a new get a new body for to receive
[43:00] that coming son that we're looking for I
[43:02] still believe the promise you say that's
[43:04] radical said he didn't say when he would
[43:06] do it but he said he would do
[43:10] it so God did not say when he would
[43:12] answer you he wants you to believe the
[43:15] answer is on the
[43:20] way now sometimes can God can
[43:23] use cruel situations to bring his
[43:27] purpose to pass God can take you to
[43:29] trials to bring his purpose to pass amen
[43:32] look at what happened to
[43:35] Joseph like we all know what the end
[43:37] result is right that's our joy that we
[43:38] are going to be seated with Jesus on his
[43:40] throne because we are Overcomers of this
[43:43] day I don't know about you but I already
[43:45] overcame this age am amen
[43:50] amen now Joseph why was his faith not
[43:53] wavering why did he continue in patient
[43:56] because he believed the dream am the
[43:58] dream saw him that his father and his
[44:01] brothers were bowing down before him so
[44:04] when he was in the pit and he didn't see
[44:06] his father and brothers bowing down
[44:08] before him he continued in patience yes
[44:11] contined having faith because he knew
[44:14] the dream must come to pass
[44:16] amen then they took him and put him in
[44:19] P's house and he was a servant
[44:22] there amen he became a servant so from a
[44:26] slave he became a
[44:28] servant but even in that situation his
[44:31] father and brothers did not bow to him
[44:33] in part of his house so he knew there
[44:35] was a further work and he was working in
[44:37] God's purpose so he continued in
[44:39] faith they threw him in
[44:43] prison but he knew that his father and
[44:45] his brothers do not bow to him they in
[44:47] prison so he knew the vision was yet for
[44:50] an appointed time amen so he had to wait
[44:52] for it so he continued in patience
[44:57] amen I got a point why I'm telling you
[44:59] all of this it's only when he was taken
[45:01] to the highest
[45:03] level of the king's
[45:06] Palace that his father and his brothers
[45:09] came to him then he knew he could say

[45:27] wavering yeah that's the end result we
[45:31] need to continue amen oh yes we're going
[45:34] to have a new body we're going to the
[45:36] marriage supper of the Lamb stop living
[45:39] like you've already achieved it this is
[45:41] not the
[45:42] Millennium this is not amen the
[45:44] restoration of all things where Christ
[45:47] has now restored Eden on the earth come
[45:50] on
[45:51] now amen we must continue in faith amen
[45:55] we must strive if we want to
[45:58] attain amen so God can use cruel take us
[46:01] to cruel trials cruel testing you wonder
[46:03] why this things have to happen the Bible
[46:05] says in Daniel 2:21 he changed the times
[46:07] and Seasons he removed Kings and he set
[46:10] it up Kings so God is in
[46:13] control amen who's Changing Times and
[46:15] seasons of your life
[46:18] God Amen you you put up these scriptures
[46:21] as I'm calling them out Daniel 2:21 he
[46:23] changed times and Seasons he removed
[46:26] Kings and set it up Kings amen this is
[46:30] God's plan yes this is God's program in
[46:33] Revelation 411 Jesus is telling us amen
[46:36] hallelujah yeah they are worshiping
[46:38] Jesus they're worshiping God sorry and
[46:40] they're saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord
[46:42] to receive glory and honor and power for
[46:45] thou has created all things and for thy
[46:48] pleasure they are and were created am
[46:52] are you created by God yes then you are
[46:54] you are serving his purpose you are here
[46:56] for his
[47:01] pleasure amen Romans
[47:04] 828 it says and we know that these
[47:06] things work together for good to them
[47:08] that love God to them who are called
[47:10] according to his purpose amen we find
[47:14] here amen why God is using now a cruel
[47:17] thing that's happening in
[47:19] Egypt these people are successful people
[47:22] they are able to build the bricks and
[47:24] give Pharaoh what he wants but Pharaoh
[47:26] is not happy because his people are
[47:28] increasing
[47:29] rapidly
[47:30] amen gone into Moses
[47:34] now but there was a family that was
[47:37] waiting for the promise because they
[47:38] were following the word of God they were
[47:41] continuing in the word the prophecy went
[47:44] out yall shall be in Egypt for 400 years
[47:48] so they knew that 400 years have
[47:51] passed hello yes yes so they were
[47:54] continuing in the word is what I'm
[47:56] trying to tell you and they knew the
[47:57] scriptural sign and evidence that they
[47:59] were looking to see so the B the prophet
[48:02] will dramatize this you can read it in
[48:05] uh a teaching on Moses I think the
[48:07] message is called teaching on Moses
[48:09] where the Prophet is bringing this out
[48:11] and he says amen that AMR got to pray
[48:15] amram and Joseph B amen or yab if you
[48:19] want to pronounce it like a Hebrew saw
[48:22] that it was time for the word to be
[48:23] fulfilled so they went to pray
[48:26] yes and the prophet says it's usually
[48:28] those who pray is the one who got the
[48:31] burden amen that's in a true sign that's
[48:33] overlooked and it's usually you'll find
[48:36] it there on the notes and it's usually
[48:38] those who pray is the one who's got the
[48:41] burden who's got the burden the one who
[48:45] is praying amen it's usually those who
[48:48] pray is the one who's got the burden the
[48:51] one who gets something it's those who
[48:53] pray that's ordained of God to do so
[48:57] so you see God has called you separated
[49:01] yourself from the things of the world
[49:02] and the glorious power of God has
[49:04] Sanctified you from them things you
[49:06] should be the happiest person there is
[49:08] in the
[49:12] world look to your
[49:15] neighbor and tell them I'm so
[49:18] happy that you are
[49:21] happy

[49:33] him I am so happy that you are so
[49:36] happy say it's okay to look at
[49:41] me
[49:43] amen you should be the happiest person
[49:46] in the
[49:48] world how many of you from today will
[49:50] say I will be the happiest person in the
[49:52] world Amen husbands look at your wives
[49:58] I don't know why brother jaff is
[49:59] laughing you also getting problems
[50:04] there you should be the happiest person
[50:07] in the world there was millions that
[50:09] would do it if they could but they can't
[50:11] it's not for them to have it are you
[50:13] listening to the prophet yes happiness
[50:16] is reserved for you thank you amen this
[50:19] is the day when the church is called out
[50:22] separated yeah little boys and girls
[50:24] what the prophet is saying to you now he
[50:25] says little boys and girls does God hear
[50:28] prayer oh little girls here does God
[50:31] hear prayer what' you say does God hear
[50:33] prayer see in the church there the boys
[50:36] and girls said yes he hears prayer does
[50:38] God answer
[50:40] prayer God can hear it but does he
[50:42] answer
[50:48] okay sometimes he makes us
[50:51] wait is that right but God answers
[50:54] prayer doesn't
[50:56] he
[51:00] amen and just because everything is
[51:03] going wrong that's no sign we should
[51:05] quit
[51:08] praying use remember what the word says
[51:11] now continue in the word then you shall
[51:13] be my disciples what does the word teach
[51:16] us the word teaches us how to

[58:37] what the I don't have time to read it
[58:38] now the prophet of God says that he
[58:41] dramatizes this and he says God is
[58:44] looking through the banister of heaven
[58:45] and he's asking his angels what are they
[58:47] doing down
[58:49] there

[59:47] basket and the prophet of God says that
[59:50] this woman knew that her brother had
[59:51] passed a cruel law so when she saw this
[59:53] baby she knew amen that this baby must
[59:56] have been an Hebrew baby but she had
[59:58] compassion in her heart because she
[1:00:00] couldn't have her own children and she
[1:00:01] said I will take this baby and I will
[1:00:03] raise this baby up you see what God will
[1:00:07] do he will make an unbelieving King pay
[1:00:10] for your maintenance yes must buy your
[1:00:13] nappies must buy your diapers must buy
[1:00:16] your wet wipes must buy your creams must

[1:00:29] [Music]
[1:00:31] luxury God will make the unbelievers
[1:00:33] take care of you yes that's
[1:00:35] right right God will make them take care
[1:00:39] of you and raise you up until you are
[1:00:42] ready to step out in your purpose the
[1:00:44] same one that Pharaoh raised was the
[1:00:46] same one that destroyed them because of
[1:00:49] him
[1:00:53] Moses amen so God is making them pay for
[1:00:57] his
[1:00:59] bills and God even if you read there
[1:01:02] further in that story how God now this

[1:01:14] she asked Miriam do you know anyone who
[1:01:16] can nurse this

[1:01:23] allows Joseph to come and the prophet
