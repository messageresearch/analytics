========================================

R oh god of how you thought of us in the back part of your mind oh God and now Lord we are people being expressed on the earth Lord Jesus father coming to our full potential at this time Lord I pray Lord you continue to do a work within us bring us to Perfection bring us to Godliness father and take us all the way oh God where you come and cap Our Lives Lord Jesus father I pray Lord that everything that will end us Lord that will cause us Lord our faith Lord to waver Lord I pray you'll take away those things Lord and I pray you'll keep our minds and our hearts Hearts our souls focused on your word Lord Jesus I pray for everyone that is coming to the house of the Lord Lord you know their needs father you know what the desire of you you know father God how to feed your children and I pray Lord this evening you'll come and break the bread of life to us Lord Jesus Lord we are make ourselves available to you even as we surrender to the Holy Spirit we ask that you come now and bless us at this time in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen I greet you all in the precious name our Lord and Savior Jesus Jesus Christ amen it's a wonderful thing to be a son and daughter of God Amen and to be called in this hour amen many are called few are chosen amen and we are the chosen people amen so we can thank the Lord for that amen praise the Lord let's turn to John chapter chapter 1 amen the same book of St John chapter 1 praise the Lord [Music] amen so in Book of John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen the same was in the beginning with God yes all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made amen so this is talking about the word and we know who that word is that word is a person Amen in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not and then we want to go down to amen verse 14 which says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld is Glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen amen praise the Lord amen you may be seated the Lord have blessings to the reading of his word amen amen I'd like to speak and maybe just title it the secret food amen secret food the secret food deity embodied in us a amen hallelujah you know we can preach many things but we've got to come into the revelation of this day amen we got to move into Perfection so there was a word sent to us to move us to Perfection amen amen hallelujah and this I'm getting from the prophet when he says the secret food and he talks about deity embodied in US amen now what is deity you may ask amen it's God himself yes amen so when we come into the message of the hour and we start to understand all of the mysteries of God and our Revelation is Progressive and we are growing in Christ we start to realize that at the end of it Christ wants to be fully manifest in you and I amen so his full Glory his full Splender will be on display through the body of Jesus Christ amen so if if we take it in the comings if we look at it and type it in the comings in the first coming God needed a body so he set aside a virgin who would align with the word of God amen amen she identified with the scripture in Isaiah 9 a virgin shall conceive she said that is me and then because she received the word for her day amen she conceived and brought for for the Lord Jesus Christ yes amen amen so that's in the first coming God needed a body and that's what we read the word became flesh so in the second coming God needs a body amen amen because in the second coming he doesn't come back to the Earth everybody understand amen we go to meet him like the Bible says in the air but he doesn't put his foot on the Earth yes right but that's why Revelation 10 and Revelation 8 is important because under that seven seal it's silence because there's a mystery going on amen amen he's doing a work on the Earth but he's coming to a people and he's doing the work through a people amen so he needs a body again yes so in the first coming the body there is called the head in the second coming the body that is formed is called the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ or the body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord so we know that in the end of the second coming he will unite The Head and the body will unite so in the second coming he also needs a body so he's got another virgin prepared oh yes amen and you and I make up that virgin bride amen amen and what are we doing making our body available so that he can come and tabernac Le in the second coming now this is the great mystery secret amen Satan himself cannot understand this neither can Satan stop it even if he did understand it he can't stop the plan of God he can't stop the program of God Amen Satan is powerless before us yes amen amen hallelujah amen so we're looking at this and I just want to background it a bit and show you because we know how the prophet tells us power comes back to the church through Revelation amen and it tells us how when she gets Revelation Satan becomes powerless before Satan becomes powerless before but here he says now in the message pardon he says traditions in them days the great prophet cried out your Traditions are powerless they stink before me the people were offering these offerings without even having faith in what they're doing now we shouldn't be like that we should know why we are coming into the message amen and why we are serving God in the message we shouldn't be doing it without faith is what I'm trying to say so now the prophet is saying in paragraph 109 let's just ask ourselves the question isn't that something like today as bad as we a to say it we've got to face facts somewhere yes now here we like to face up to facts amen amen right is right and wrong is wrong I'm talking about here in this church we don't like to candico things if the message church is in the state we need to say it amen if we are in a state we need to say it amen so here the prophet is saying there is something wrong somewhere why this church ought to be a million miles up the road to where it is now Jesus is waiting on his church to get ready amen amen amen how many of you can identify that we are the church am the prophet is saying Jesus is waiting on you to get ready his bride has made himself ready we got the potentials the holy spirit is here God is here the power to heal the sick the power to do all the things that Christ did have we seen it I've seen it demonstrated Myself by the holy spirit so the potentials are here so then what next he says what God is waiting for us to get away is from our traditions and come back under the blood of his son Jesus Christ and become the Church of the Living God amen amen he says I believe that that was all that within me God has sent down the Holy Spirit to do that but we with our rituals without sincerity we're going it's our tradition because it's a ritual we go without sincerity Without Really sorrowfulness of sin amen now here in the message the pergam church age I'm going to read a bit tonight because I want to establish the truth of what the prophet is saying and he says from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride now this is talking about you and I that's why I'm bringing this in she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas oh yes now this is the important part by and through the members of the of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin amen amen now what I'm I trying to say is that we are coming now to a place where he wants to fully Express himself through the body of Jesus Christ through the bride through your body through my body not just to flesh man now because the spirit amen the flesh the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak amen that's why we need a body change amen hallelujah but we've got to be so built up that this the flesh man can't take it that he got to give way for the new body amen praise the Lord you and God's gifts always find their places he says that Jesus was the fullness of all the prophets cuz they were the word of the Lord if you call those Gods whom the word came to how can you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God see even those in that age was identified as Gods God called them himself God what were they now here's where I'm going they were the manifestation of his word and yeah was he the fullness of the word deity embodied deity manifested In the Flesh amen hallelujah praise the Lord and I'm going to go now to the quote where I'm taking my title from in the message spiritual food in due season the prophet is saying if he appear to us in a physical body he's talking about now if Jesus appeared to us in a physical body looked just exactly like off man's head of Christ at 33 and blood running out of his hand and so forth nailed scars all over him I wouldn't accept it that's a statement right if Jesus Christ appeared on the earth now in a physical body like of man's head and he can show the nail scars and blood coming out of it he says I won't accept it why it's not time and season for him to come that way amen he's got to come like the word says He must come yes amen so the question then must be asked what will brother Bram accept in what form will he accept him amen he says no no no I won't accept it when he comes himself so now he's talking about when he will come every eye shall see him every tongue shall confess him and as the lightning Cometh From The East unto the West so shall it be we don't believe these Cults and clans we believe God in his word amen now this is the paragraph I want you to write down and maybe go and look at spiritual food in due season paragraph 168 but he embodies himself taking your body and my body and give you gifts amen gives me gifts and through these gifts He makes himself known amen yes L that's the secret food he says amen amen amen thank you he says if you're going to search it later go type there that's the secret food or type the secret food you'll find the quote amen so how is the world going to see Jesus he's placed gifts within us he's taken your body he's taken my body amen and he's expressing himself through US amen amen and he says he's making himself known in this day in the second coming of Christ amen through the many membered body and he says that's the secret food amen thank you he says no matter how much he would make himself known by me you've got to believe it now watch He's attributing Faith to this now what I just said no matter how much he would make himself known by me you've got to believe it you've got to have the gift of faith too to believe it amen so what we are telling you now you've also got to have faith to believe it because that's what the word is saying about you and perfect faith is for you to get a revelation of what the word says about you to believe the word and then act on the word amen amen amen we can't skip the steps we can hear the word we can believe the word but then we've got to act on the word amen there's no use sympathizing with the message no use sympathizing and coming so close and knowing all the revelations but then falling short how do we fall short not acting on the word amen praise the Lord he says how is it that we can see other great signs and wonders is done on others and what about us it should cause an estate of desperation that we are determined before God the signs of his coming should bring the entire congregation when we've read it from the word amen he says the newspapers packet the magazines packet show a picture of it now he's talking about you know the cloud and things come back here and see those great Mysteries hidden in the Bible opened up to us on a new field that we we've never known before perfectly Blends into the coming of the Lord Jesus then at the end of The Messengers see the action of the great Holy Spirit see come down visible before the people even taking pictures of it see it working signs and wonders that it's not a man it's not a preacher it's not a certain congregation it's the Holy Spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ now it it's embodied in the body of his bride it should throw us into desperation amen and we find as we progress in this Revelation about his glory being fully revealed through us it's got to take deity to do that when we are talking about creative power and the power to operate Mark 11:23 it's not I that doth The Works you see the bride can't be different from the groom she's got to be so in Union with him did Jesus say it's not I that do the works but my father that dwelleth in me so now creative power to operate Mark 11:23 now let me say this that Mark 1123 was only opened up in this Century 20th century prior to that nobody could understand Mark 11:23 nor could anyone have the faith to operate Mark 11:23 yes amen nobody could do it but the prophet of the age yes amen was able to unlock Mark 11:23 creative power now that creative power is not at the will of man that creative Power is coming when deity embodies himself how is De you're going to say now how is deity going to embody himself the Holy Spirit amen when the Holy Spirit can take full control of a man now I want to ask you a question what does perfect Faith look [Music] like when you see it on display in you and I what does perfect Faith really look like how many of us won perfect Faith amen amen majority of us wanton perfect Faith amen what does perfect Faith look like if we look at the first example of perfect faith I'm talking about brother Brandon now what did it really look like we would expect perfect Faith to be somebody fully in Authority fully in control fully in charge everybody understand what I'm saying a prophet bold but he's sitting in the woods with his Bible and he's asking the Lord I don't understand the scripture Mark 11:23 right I'm talking about the origins of perfect faith in William brandham through Mark 11:23 now he's sitting there and the Lord asked him what did you come for and he tells him I came for squirrels amen so I'm trying to show you that it wasn't something big bold powerful under his super Revelation and the super anointing we know the super anointing came down but look look at how the prophet was being tooted into perfect Faith he starts to question and reason and and starts to have this dialogue with God if you going to read the account and he says I don't understand it then the the Lord is telling why why don't you speak amen what is he doing tutoring him in perfect Faith yes amen so then he says you know even even the prophet why I'm saying how does perfect Faith look like he says let the SC come here there there there this way and the squirrel came he shot it then he says he had to rub his eyes and really check now did that thing and then he says a squirrel doesn't bleed what am i showing you the Lord is taking him in Grace and showing him perfect Faith how to operate Mark 11:23 if you say Amen now did the prophet go there when he said speak and ask for his squiddle did he go to pray and say Lord Jesus according to your word according to Mark 11:23 your word says if I say to this mountain be thou removed cast into the sea don't doubt in my heart but believe what I have said shall come to pass I shall have what I have said so therefore based on your word oh God I speak now and I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let a squirrel appear there because what is perfect Faith must take you back to Adam condition and Adam never had to pray amen amen amen amen amen that's that's why Jesus is saying if you say not if you pray if you say to this mountain and you come back to your Adam condition you can speak yes amen we know that Adam could speak to the winds if a river was coming a certain way and Adam could redirect the river he could speak amen hallelujah Adam could speak to the son remember glimpses of it in Joshua Adam could speak to the sun yes Adam could speak to the Moon if Joshua did it then Adam definitely did it amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah not only you see not only did he could he speak but he also understood the heavenly bodies cuz remember Enoch understood the heavenly bodies that's why he designed the pyramid so perfectly amen that it comes in alignment yes amen the pyramids built in the center of the earth remember job and all of these things is talking about pladies and Orion job is the oldest man that lived one of the oldest people in the Bible and he knows about the Sun the Stars the moons talks about the ples and Orion the Seven Stars amen so this knowledge was given to man in the beginning and that's why Jesus is saying now if you say to this mountain so what am I trying to tell you look at our perfect Faith was now instilled into a prophet taking him back to his Adam condition God schooling the prophet in perfect faith and what am I trying to show you it wasn't something super duper it was in a simple humble way him having a conversation with the Lord and then he he even wants to go away and the Lord tells him but didn't you say you came for three you know like some of us would expect the story to be I went over there and there was no squiddles and I looked at Mark 11:23 and the power of God Came Upon me and I just spoke and I spoke and I spoke if it was another preacher they probably would have said it that way but he was just his own character am he said it in a way we could understand it because he knows even us amen sometimes it's hard for the human mind to comprehend Supernatural things so he says it in a way to school us and make us understand that perfect faith can come in Simplicity amen amen in the Simplicity of your home in the Simplicity of your situation you can take the word and apply it but you've got to believe what the word says about you amen that is why we are talking about deity embodied In You and I the secret food you see if we really knew who we are and I'm talking about if we really knew who we are amen amen that we didn't come just at at the conception amen uh at Birth in our natural birth but that we had a beginning from before that time amen that we are Sons and Daughters of God amen amen that we are the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that God wants to manifest his glory through us we take charge of every circumstance but that's perfect Faith perfect faith is knowing who you are amen recognizing who you are as a son and daughter of God you know the prophet is telling us here in perfect Faith he's telling us about these disciples who were given Authority and power over snakes and scorpions according to Luke 10 right Luke chapter 10 I have given the authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and overcome all the powers of the enemy but here they are and they come Jesus comes off the mountain remember Jesus coming off the mountain Peter James and John they come now and they're faced with a situation that the disciples can't cast out this epileptic Spirit from this boy you remember the story amen and what does Jesus tell them Jesus tells them because of your unbelief what is unbelief they they doubt the word they don't have faith so their faith is partial and the prophet is saying they had the power but they didn't have the faith to operate the power amen and he says what is the power the Holy Ghost in you the Holy Ghost in you and I remember the Dynamics is the power power come back to the church so what I'm trying to tell you by this is that the dynamic can be in the church but you need Faith to operate it you see because the Holy Ghost won't take your body and start to use it without your permission yes I said de embodied in US man must stand up yes man must speak amen hallelujah what did if you go and study what the Holy Ghost is sinful he'll lead you he'll guide you into all truth he's the spirit of wisdom the spirit of knowledge the spirit of Truth amen amen and if I ask you this question what Spirit did man Adam have in the beginning before the fall what kind of a spirit did he have we know it's a perfect Spirit right yes a perfect Spirit was it a Godlike Spirit yes made in the image and after the likeness of God yes amen oh come on church amen I'm trying to jog your memory from before the beginning before the foundation of the world Amen I'm trying to show you the kind of spirit that you and I ought to have oh yes amen a spirit that ought to govern us amen amen hallelujah I'm trying to show you the spirit that God designed for us in the beginning thank you Lord because God is a spirit and when he said let us make man in our image and out our likeness he was making a man that was Godlike so what was that Spirit remember if we fell from something we must be restored back to the same Spirit that's what I'm trying to tell us amen so what Spirit did we fall from oh yes and what Spirit must we be restored to amen have God good use for you God has sent the spirit that was in Adam amen hallelujah the perfect spirit that was in Adam the perfect spirit that Adam had is the Holy Ghost come on now amen amen you get it the perfect spirit is the Holy Ghost so we need to align with the holy spirit because that's the perfect Spirit image and the spirit of man supposed to be in now you know why the prophet says he's got to give us a new spirit in order to get along with the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord so the Holy Ghost is our ought to be conditioned yes amen hallelujah oh yes amen so love the Holy Ghost amen amen say I want more and more because what are you saying as you receive the Holy Ghost you are coming into your image you are coming into your fullness of your Adam and Eve condition where deity can fully Express himself through you and I oh the Holy Ghost amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord how if you love the holy spirit amen how many if you love the way the holy spirit makes you do things that the flesh hates am makes you love everybody makes you love everybody makes you love everybody it's good enough for me amen hallelujah uh Holy Ghost can't make you backbite Holy Ghost can't make you amen be jealous Holy Ghost can amen makes you forgive amen hallelujah amen Holy Ghost makes you Godlike brings you back to your god-given position god-given Authority amen hallelujah holy ghost leads you to the word amen hallelujah holy ghost is teaching you the word Holy Ghost leading you guiding you directing you amen bringing you in Step amen with what God is doing in this hour amen we heard on Sunday when the drum beat changes Holy Ghost tells you amen change in music go to way do that and the bride is Marching In Step marching to the beat of Onward Christian Soldiers amen hallelujah am amen so the Holy Ghost is our perfect condition the Holy Ghost is the perfect image that we ought to be in and that's why God says amen that the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost a refilling of his spirit amen amen thank you Lord hallelujah and let's say Lord let it come in a double portion Oh Come and Tabernacle me Lord Jesus bring my secret food now food is necessary for us right every none of us can live without food amen you know I was reading here in the book of Corinthians I didn't write a mark the scripture now but I was just reading it that we should do everything for the glory of God whether we eat whether we drink it should all be for the glory of God and some people really love to display the glory of God amen they love that scripture they display the full glory amen so but in everything we ought to display the glory of God Amen now we ought to live such Christlike lives that the people can't tell the difference between us and Jesus amen hallelujah I know I know you really believe that I know it's hard to say Amen to them because the flesh gets in the way amen something triggers us and then we can just get get upset but that's why Temperance and how do we sweeten our how do we get our temper under control we sweeten our temper with prayer amen next time you find yourself getting angry you feel your blood boiling remember who you are amen amen remember who you are as a son and daughter of God because why the prophet says that sticky nature will always be with you but you've got to bring it under this objection and you tell him all nature I will not allow you to dominate this body you know what the key is don't respond immediately amen amen you know as you mature in life as you get older in life you learn these things when you're younger you are hotheaded you are quick to speak amen quick to respond amen just say anything bless anything but be tempered have patience speak a word in wisdom rather say i' rather not speak now Lord give me wisdom how to respond the Bible says answer not a fool according to his folly amen so most most things will come to tempt you amen we can switch that power brother it's okay praise the Lord brother Jeff you can switch it off but maybe I can get the HDMI I can show you some quotes here then we're going to close I think it's more effective when you can see it for yourself amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah there's a message of prophet preachers and if you get a chance I want you to read it it's called the word became flesh so another name for it is India trip report amen maybe some of you have read it he makes some profound statements here we also need to switch this okay it's back on there's no signal there coming up there is it see how big I can get it so this one is not coming on so here's the quote you can see he embodies himself taking your body my body gives me gifts gives you gifts and through these gifts He makes himself known amen amen so that's a quote I was reading there and you can see here it says that's the secret food okay we gone past that now maybe it's a cable in the back of the T okay let me get to the point I want to read now in 175 he says when Jesus no wonder when he come off the hill that night and looked around that tree for food and there was no food on the tree he said no man eateth from thee and he went on away and the next day coming back the tree had withered God's mind the mind that in the beginning that was a thought before it was a word that expressed Jesus Christ the same one is was expressing that word back again you see what what he's trying to tell you there this is the same one that said let every tree bring forth after its kind and when he saw that this tree was not bringing forth after its kind every seed then he cursed that seed right amen so the point he's trying to bring here now you got to catch this okay I'm trying to take it slow tonight cuz I want you to catch this he's saying just like how that was a law that every seed must bring forth of its kind in the Bible the word is in seed form you can see there it says every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laying in seed form amen that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass amen everybody understanding that amen amen read it nice and slow yeah and understand what he is saying he's saying the words that are laying in the Bible is seed form yes amen but if you and I can take that Bible and speak it by the same thought in the beginning amen you'll make it come to pass you'll bring it to pass see what I mean how powerful could the church be amen the Bible says let this mind that was in Christ be in you am as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now your thoughts if they become expression right like God said let there be a word before it could be a word it had to be a thought so God in the creation created the world by his thought and the thought expressed became material see what I mean now if that same spirit that said let there be light and there was light Let There Be trees and there was trees if the same mind that was in Christ be in you how much could it say let there be no cancer amen amen yes you see when you realize that you are part of God listen to what he's saying now God is embodied in you so he's saying if that same spirit that they said let there be light and there was light Let There Be trees and there was trees if that same mind that was in Christ is in you how much could it say let there be no cancer and it would be gone let the blind eyes be open and it would be so it's your thought amen amen amen so could it be that you see somebody with cancer and you let them lay you walk away because you don't have faith to operate the power could it be that we' be in a situation yet we don't have the faith to operate the word and speak to that situation amen speak to that problem not have mental Faith now but really have faith in the word of God say Lord I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I believe your word and right now I'm faced with this but I know who I amen and I know that I'm being restored back to my original condition I know that you have given me the Holy Ghost so I speak to the situation whatever it be amen it must obey my voice amen and I believe it in My Heart Lord I speak it with my mouth I believe it in my heart and what I have said shall come to pass am how much more could it say let there be no cancer and it would be gone let the blind eyes be open and it would be so what made the that man that I was witnessing to come back a month later and tell me it worked it worked amen because the prayer that was prayed Lord give him new lungs the man couldn't breathe the man was struggling to breathe had to live on eight tablets a day but something Divine hand of God allowed him to walk by that way be ministered to amen and he goes back into his at night that night and he says Lord I don't know who that man is but if you sent him and your word is true and what he said is true prove yourself he says he slept like a baby that night but he came back when he came he saw us he came running and he said it worked it worked amen now what if I had stayed silent that's what I'm trying to show you here these things are seeds and we are faced with opportunities every day we are faced with circumstances every day amen amen and like how we started out the only Jesus people will see is through you and I Jesus is not coming back in a physical body on the earth now he's working through a many membered body amen is Jesus Christ in you and I he's using your hands and he's using your feet amen I can't express that enough tonight and you may be thinking why I'm emphasizing it constantly and repeatedly I'm trying to make it sink in Lord but wait a minute he said have faith in God for verily verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved plucked up cast into the sea don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said shall come to pass you shall have whatever things thou say is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it what power has been given to the ch church that now you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happened and express it in word form that word takes a hold and becomes material a thought expressed we spoke about faith being the wrong material amen hallelujah that brings the Unseen into a seen world how many if you believe you have the faith of God amen amen to bring the Unseen into a seen World Hallelujah you know brother Brandon was talking to ATI right and he said if you want a million dollars right now you can have it amen you got e it right here sitting here in the wheelchair if you speak and you say healing to her body you shall have it where was the million dollars going to come from from amen but you do you believe that if at you right asked to a million dollars it would have materialized right there amen the same way the prophet says if I left my pocket knife at home and I tell you by faith I believe the pocket knife is in my pocket right now you see natural man can't understand it natural man can't comprehend it but Faith even if you left it in at home on the dresser faith can put it in your pocket right nowall if you go read again the message uh where the Prophet is speaking about Mark 11:23 what's the message called amen if you remember the title of it speak to the mountain amen thank you speak to the mountain you know what the prophet says there when he was hunting for the squirels he shot three and he said he there was a fourth one that he shot but because he shot three he took it away and he told the brothers about this incident you come across it on the tape he said his Deacon I think it's brother Tony or somebody started he said it in a way amongst all the other brothers as well and the way he said it like he doubted brother brandom and he said well brother brandham if you really it it will be there in the morning we'll go and look for it so brother Bram starts to get all anxious now he said but how can he doubt me how could he say it in front of all those people surely I mean that's my Deacon why would he doubt [Music] it you know what the prophet told him while they on the way back there I mean what the Lord told the prophet the Lord told the prophet even if it's not there you speak it and it will be there amen the Lord wasn't going to make his Prophet a liar amen he says even if you can't find it when you go there you speak it and you'll find it and by God's grace when he went there eventually found it what am I telling you speak by faith first you got to recognize who you are as a Son of God Amen and then you've got to have some form of expression some form of thought what do you want for your life do you have a vision for your life do you have a vision where you want to be yes you know you go for any interview for a job to they ask you where do you want to be some people don't know where they want to be so they don't have a vision they don't have a plan amen we ought to have a plan if we are in the image and likeness of God God saw the end from the beginning amen we've got to Envision ourselves what we want to be the kind of home we want to have the kind of wife we want to have the kind of children we want to have we've got to start to see these things amen listen to what I'm saying now you've got to start the to see these things and when you start to see these things that's how you get Frei to start to make it and come into operation because faith is the evidence of things hopeful faith is the substance of things hopeful the evidence of things not yet seen amen now what in case you had no hope what in case you are like that man what the prophet says oh whatever will be will be we'll see how it goes a man with no vision the Bible says where there's no vision the people perish what if we as a church had no vision to move on higher into the things of God what if we had no vision and says oh
