so amen as the days are approaching and the end times are coming you'll see amen the desire to worship God will be phasing out amen from the nominal Christian but the one that is connected with him

hallelujah so whatever we reading in the word ought to be reflecting in our own lives amen hallelujah so we amen we just what we're doing is we just succumbing to the word allowing the word to have

upon you we give you now the praise the glory and all the honor and all the thanks in Jesus name amen amen I greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ when you got your bibl we turn to the book of St John chapter 15 am amen you love the Lord amen we know that uh we turned the corner yes amen amen and uh things are not the way it used to be amen if you even in the world yes things are not the same the world has even the world system has turned a corner when you are looking at politicians when you are looking at uh uh the economy and all these things that are going around look at it with spiritual eyes look Beyond the Veil of those people amen because 200 million demons on the earth influencing mankind so just like that we also have heard from another source amen amen we are also being influenced from another source amen amen thank you Lord we have the angel of God amongst us amen and he's our influence yes amen he's the guide amen yes he is the one that is leading us thank you Lord he is the one has taken us when we turn the corner wondering what what are we going on to now where are we entering into it wasn't us it's the guide that is leading us amen when Moses was told to take the children out of Egypt to the promised land Moses don't know where he's going to he had to follow the guides the angel of the Lord went before him when Joshua was commissioned to take the people over Jordan he had to have the guide amen he had to meet the captain of the house amen am when this prophet of God was given the commission and to go and take this message around the world he had to meet the guide amen amen it was the angel of God leading him amen and that's why the angel of God even could lead him and say don't follow those ministers that want to go to Cape Town and so forth you need to come to Durban amen you have to follow the guide amen so just like that we have the guide in our lives sometime you might think your conscious is speaking to you telling you don't do this don't do that if you are sensitive to the Holy Spirit then you'll know who is speaking to you you'll know who is leading you amen and when you hearing sermons The revelation of God being unveiled to you week after week in such a way that it never was before then you need to look Beyond the Veil and recognize that the guide is here amen amen he the spirit of Truth when he come he will show you all things amen and he works through the five-fold ministry yes amen the St John chapter 15 reading from verse one I am the True Vine yes and my father is the husbandman amen so Christ is the true vine amen every branch in me that beareth not fruit he take it away because there can be branches in the vine amen grafted in but they will bear no fruit he take it away yes and every branch that bear fruit so there will also be branch that will bear fruit he Purge it it that it may bring forth more fruits amen because watch the husband man which is God working through the Holy Spirit coming down through the fivefold ministry he must Purge these branches because he don't want just fruit what he says that it may bring forth more fruits amen now they are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you Hallelujah now this bride has not just receive the the letter rain we receive the former rain and the letter rain so this bride receives word and receives stimulation of Revelation amen so now yeah I clean through the word which I've spoken unto you now this is not any word now this is not the word that you had when you had an experience in the denomination this is not a word you had experience out there no this is the message of the hour this is the original seed amen this is the original word this is the unadulterated word therefore you couldn't have a new birth out there in your denominations because the atmosphere wasn't right to but you amen you had to come in the message of the hour to receive the new birth you have to come under the right atmosphere so he says abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine amen no more can ye except you abide in me amen you may be seated I'll read more of that I just don't want you to stand long enough so he says now you clean through the word which have spoken unto you abide in me so he's the vine but he wants us to abide in him amen hallelujah now automatically when you're saying he is a vine and we abiding in him now we know that uh the vine it cannot produce produce the fruit it's the branches that produces the fruit yes but if you look at the natural Vine the vine produces the sep right and what what what is the sep that is speaking of the life amen amen because if you look at it in the natural SE can be considered like the blood of the vine yes just that we like in natural now let's do some biology like we have arteries and veins to transport blood through our body the the vine and FL the vine is Flo and xylem the flo would be more similar to oxygen rich arteries this is the nutrient Rich sap that flows from the leaves and brings the Hons and sugars to stem and Roots now what what that now in the spiritual he says here he is the main Vine that which comes out from the original root from the original seed that has life in it now the vine does not bear fruit it is the branches that do that now what this you can take a citrus tree as an orange tree and graft into it a grapefruit limb a lemon limb a Tang tangul Lim and other kinds of that variety and all those limbs will grow but those grafted limbs will not bear oranges no sir the lemon limb will bear lemons and the grapefruit lamb will bear grapefruit and so on yet those LMS will be driving of the life in the tree but if the tree ever puts forth another branch of itself amen amen amen we come from God and we go to God am amen amen so what he's speaking about here in the scripture automatically you are seeing there must be a connection with the branch and the vine The Roots amen there must be a connection between you and God we must be of the same amen you must come from the origins but those grafted Li he said but now when he's when he's giving the scenario you know what he's talking about right we know the message because there came a time after seven Church ages yes where the original word will come again because the prophet had to go out and seow amen but he's going around the world and he's sowing the seed but he's sewing the seed for what for another harest time amen because he knew there was going to be in harest time and he's going and sewing but he knew this one is going to produce the same life that was in the Vine thank you amen so we speaking tonight abiding in the vine the Bride is a fruitful branch and you can where I get the thought you can look at Genesis 49 verse 22 you can put that up Genesis 49 verse 22 when Joseph I'm sorry when when uh Israel Jacob is blessing is the 12 tribes or the his 12 the 12 sons is his and he being Israel being a prophet yes is is prophetically prophesying over them but when he comes to Joseph in verse 22 he says Joseph is a fruitful bow even a fruitful Bow by a well whose branches run over the wall now Joseph we know types Christ but the mystery locked up in Joseph is perfection amen but and the bride has to come to perfection in this hour amen so that mystery is the bride is typing Perfection yes and if she's going to be the perfect one in this hour typing Perfection is our then she must be a fruitful Branch amen not anyone else not any other Church contemporary church it's a bride that will be a fruitful Branch yes amen so we find that we find ourself in the word in the message and we find oursel living on this word amen but if you remain stagnant and there's no growth then there's something wrong with you yes that's why God working to the 5old ministry is going to come and bring the word and the word is going to prune all the things all this world out it's going to prune Leia out because Leia has such an influence on you your families of the world have such an influence on you you say I don't spend time with my friends I don't spend time with people of the world watch your social media watch your communication because that's the communication you don't have to go to them but you can be communicating with them all the time and he said if you are not a strong influence over them they are going to influence you amen amen because that's how strong the spirits are now am amen and that's what the word is coming to do to to prune you out Amen to keep reminding you that you are not like every other human being that you are now somebody special on the earth amen you was born for a purpose amen you come from God and you are getting prepared the message of the hour has come to prepare you for a Rapture the message of the hour is a going away message the message of the hour is not an Earthly message the message of the hour is not to make you build your kingdom on the earth the message of the hour is not make you to stay at bounds amen it shows you that you're an eagle it come to show you your true or regions where you come from and where you are going that you are a son and daughter of God Amen thank you Lord thank you Jesus but and this and the message of the Hour come to show you that you are living in the adoption age amen and if you are in the adoption age you have to receive the spirit of adoption amen and if you receive the spirit of adoption then it means your growth cannot be stunted amen it means that you are growing you are progressing in the faith amen that's why I said it's time we are the corner amen the very word that we have received from we not we not it's being now progressing amen more light is sh shining on it because amen it's now this Vine is there now being a fruitful Branch drawing out of the well I mean coming out of the well amen amen it's extending now amen he's running over the wall now amen because it's by the well what well amen this Prophet has brought a message that no light has shine over amen amen he had to dig a well that no light shine over and then what produce from it sub seed marriage and divorce the opening of the word the Seven Seals seven tles all these things amen I began to pour out from the rivers of Living Water amen oh it's a fountain of life amen and we began to draw from it we're not drawing from broken system we drawing from this well this rivers of Living Waters amen amen and we are abiding in the vine amen then we must become fruitful branches amen because he's pruning us amen for what so that we can be fruitful amen amen we can have a beautiful cluster of tribulation of Revelation thank you Lord amen you know how beautiful when God is is showing us in the word he's showing us in nature how he's working how all the mystery is being unfolded amen yes that's why in the Bible he's showing us that he's the vine we are the branches he's showing us he's the rose of Sheron he's the lies of The Valleys he's the root and offspring of David he's the tree of life amen he's showing us all these things so let me just give you this quote to give you context so yeah he's quoting this message he says in St John the 15th chapter read the same verse one Jesus said I am the vine ye the branches now the branch and Vine is connected together now like I said there's many other crafted branches in but this Branch where it's of his kind which has the same life amen amen amen it's connected together because in the uniting time and sign there was an invisible Union taking place amen there was a connection taking place this one year is now bearing the fruits of the spirit this one is partakers of his divine nature bringing you to a stature of a perfect man Hallelujah it couldn't be done in Wesley's age it couldn't be done in lud's age it couldn't be done in Pentecost it had to be done under the right atmosphere amen yes amen it had to be done in this age When what when the mighty Angel come downall amen amen yes amen amen hallelujah this word is taking us to Eternity amen this is an eternal word an inexhaustible Fountain of Life amen this is not some dried up philosophy this is not some dried up theology that's why you can't take this message and make it theology you will kill it amen you got to let the Holy Spirit oh breath life to it you got to let the going to bring it freshh you got to give room for the Holy Ghost to work that he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same God that can produce Miracles he is the same God that can take this word and can bring it to life amen within you he's the same God that can take the violent Sinner and transform their lives with the power of transformation Lord amen oh because rapturing faith lies on his word oh yes because this word is getting you are getting ready right now to change Dimensions yes amen amen you got to change Dimensions this body is going to change amen that's right the sixth Dimension is going to empty out one of these days there's going to be a ren reunion yes we're not far from there we're living that hour now we are living in that season amen it's coming to the season because the Rapture cycle already started while people are thinking there's going to be a Rapture the Rapture cycle started already with a shout to gather the living Saints amen and the shout is still going out amen because they come another cycle now where this bride must take this word and thou must prophesy again before Nations tongues and Kings amen you're going to take the same word and the same holy ghost that was with the prophet is going to bring this word to light now in the present hour and he's going to prophesy again amen amen you know many people mistake our message Believers as introverts because we are oddballs we cannot stay long in the company of scoffers yes we cannot stay long in the company of Sinners yes we cannot stay long in a company of those that cannot produce quality conversation yes and our quality conversation is stimulation of Revelation amen amen so they they mistake us for introverts because we don't want to speak much amongst them we want to we want to shy away but the difference with us is that the only thing that stimulates us is revelation yes and you might say but we should be amongst all the people Jesus was among the publicans yes the prophet went around the world amongst all the denominations he was fellowshipping with them preaching among them there was an hour for that there was a time for that yes but under the third pool oh yes how many people was having conversations with him how under the third pool how many people departed from Jesus where was the multitude then yes under the opening of the word yes amen this is the opening of the word he come to show you your real family amen he come to show you where you truly come from yes amen it come to show you that our life on Earth was already pre-planned amen things that are to be amen our life on Earth God pre-planned it he knew what time and season we be born he knew that he prepared us that we'll have an anointing for this age am he knew that for us to live out this age he'll have to anoint us to overcome this age amen amen he's given us the overcoming power for this age he knew what it would take and and you knew what calbar people was needed for this age we wouldn't have managed in the days of Paul they had a different anointing we are anointed for our age amen we are anointed to overcome 200 million demons on the earth demon power amen am we have to to overcome the deceitful hor Rider amen yes where is going around deceiving amen that is why when you see things are changing around the world in politics in e the economy and with the world system you are not deceived yeah he already told us what's going to happen we already were one of what was going to take place yes amen so all these things are not new for Are Not Unusual to us amen yes when you see Wars rumors of wars and all these things that are happening right now we shouldn't be shocked when we see all the economies that are captured we shouldn't be shocked amen we we know what Satan is doing amen we know that he's controlling the economies we know what he's planning what his end result is why is he doing that but under this third pool we are anointed to overcome this age amen we anointed where he said us if you abide in me and I abide in you ask what you will and he shall receive amen amen you know the first time that was used was underes amen the prophet of God sharing what happened in the woods sharing the testimony and she said she amen the word she believed it amen she said absolutely correct that's absolutely the truth brother Bram and then she could have whatsoever she desired yes she could asked for money she could have had it she could ask for the healing of uh of of her sister edot she could have had it whatever she wanted at that time she could have had it but she saw the need of eternal life for boys now you might have a different need whatever your need is you are abiding in the vine amen whatever your need is you can have it too amen if you go on in the Scripture it says let's read in verse four he says abide in me and I in you he said as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me I am the vine here the branches he that abided in me and I in him the same bringeth for much fruit for without me you can do nothing amen yes so that is why you finding a dead Church world now there was a time where they was producing something because they was eating they was drinking of the the rain that was falling down yes they was enjoying the rain that was falling down but this is the hour now they are not abiding in the vine and whatever life was left in them died off now yes amen amen amen and when the life dies off it's no good anymore yes it has to be just stwn for the fire yes that's where we are right now there's no more life in there was a few years ago let's go 10 years back they had some life in them but it completely died off now and what they did now they substituted substituted it for entertainment in the church yes they brought entertainment because that's the only thing they can do now to keep the people in their numbers to keep the people there they to have entertainment and how did they get so big and mega and have all this money because when the prophet went out down to the South amongst the Pentecostals there were a poor bunch of people but spirit filled and he saw something about them and he was hiding there and then they told him he's a preacher and they called him to preach yeah you Le the story and how he preached and then he began inviting him but when the ministry went under the first two pools It produced a healing Revival around spearheaded a healing Revival around the world and it began those poor Pentecostals now began to get numbers they started to get the multitudes coming in and because of the numbers coming in they began to become very wealthy and they began to produce numbers because they was became successful in the Ministries and then eventually under the third pool now they rejected this Prophet they rejected the word they couldn't produce anymore now because his Prophet is not amongst them and as they started dying they started bringing now other things in started bringing doctrin Prosperity doctrines and so forth in to keep the numbers and to keep the money to keep the wealth in the church because what it says about the leian church yes th knowest thou say thou was rich and increased with Goods but knowest not that are naked yes amen so they became increased with goods and all these things but they benefited from this ministry amen they all benefited from this but now it's time because they haven't abided in the vine there's no life in them amen amen so he said and I in the same bringeth forth much food for without me you can do nothing if you what is he he's the word Christ is the word this same Jesus that they claim I love you Jesus oh and we sing about Jesus we love Jesus but he said if you love me you will keep my words amen and my words will not be Grievous unto you yes amen so they don't want him the word and his word is Grievous to them but he saying they love him they love the benefit of him yes if a man abide not in me is cast for as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye AB in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will yes and it shall be done unto you now you think God is a liar he's saying if you're abiding in me which means now you're abiding in this life you enjoying this life amen you are drawing from this Fountain of Life you abiding in the vine amen you are staying in the word amen you are faithful to the word you are being stimulated by the word then he's saying you shall ask what you will amen and it shall be done unto you amen yes and he's saying here in is my father glorified that ye bear much fruits amen so shall you be my disciples you see how God is glorified when you bear much fruit amen he said as the father loved me so have I loved you continue Y in my love Now watch how he says how you do it now if ye keep my Commandments ye shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love he said this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you amen now how did he love them did he compromise with what he is the word no he brought his he shared with them his word amen how did he love them he shared with his disciples the word while he speaking out there in Parables with them he revealed his word plainly amen amen he began to speak his word in plain language to them he opened up the word to them others couldn't see it but they could see it he said and watch what he says here these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be fill he said this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you Greater Love at no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends he says ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you henceforth I call you not servants for the servant know it not what is Lord doth but I have called you friends for all things that I heard of my father I have made known unto you amen so if you want to still remain as a if you're a son but you can still remain as a servant yes if you don't grow to maturity and the word is not made plain to you then you can remain as a servants yes but you a son you get what I'm saying because a son deferred nothing from a servant if he hasn't come to maturity and know and doesn't know how to handle the father's Affairs this is the adoption age amen you got to know how to handle the father's Affairs amen you got to know that you want this world to manifest your father's Kingdom amen amen you got to be about your father's business yes amen he said seek ye first the kingdom of God and is righteousness then all these things amen shall be added unto you God is Not depriving you of anything but he's asking you seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness when Elijah went to the widow woman right he asked her for a meal to make him a meal right cuz he's representing the word the prophet right he's carrying the word he asked the widow woman to make him a meal first he said do this first then the blessings came to her amen she be to be obedient to the word yes for the word of God comes to the prophet and she had to obey the word when she obeyed the word then the blessings followed amen so seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness so God is Not depriving us of anything yes the stores is open unto us amen amen all the things that you have need of God is willing to give it to you amen he said but hence forth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you God chose His Bride yes choosing of a bride amen God chose His Bride he for every age he called up bride out amen which is all makes up the bride amen and in this age he called A peculiar people people with certain characteristics that will be part of his bride but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring for fruits and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he may give it you these things I command you that you love one another amen if the world ate you you know it hated me before it hated you if you were of the world the world would love his own but because you are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hated you so you see we are in this world but we are not of this world we are representing another kingdom while we are here amen we're ambassadors of another kingdom remember the the word that I said unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you so he is the word now right we know they persecuting the word if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also so when you are speaking you're not speaking your own word you are speaking his words amen amen so don't be shocked in the hour of the third pool in the hour of the opening of the word when you are preaching to the Souls Lost in prison where people totally don't want to hear the word or people are are shocked at the things that you're saying and they have no idea they have no clue and they don't want to even hear it so that's the hour that we we approaching now amen but we still have to go and preach the gospel am he said you must take up your cross and follow me he never said you mustn't be persecuted but you will be persecuted for the true word amen he said but all these things will they do unto you for my name sake because they know not him that sent me if I had not come and spoken unto you unto them they had not they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin he that hated me hated my father also if I have had not done among them The Works which none other man did they had not had sinned but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father but this come to pass that the word might be fulfilled that written the law they hated me without a CA and we know that in a message indictment this is what happened again the word got crucified again when the world when the when the message went when this Prophet went around the world manifesting Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen 30,000 at one time being saved 25,000 being healed trck seven I don't know how many truckload of the municipality was way would crutch and so forth in a parade people who we tches all over the people in India when all the Brahman and so forth all the siks and the the the madin and all so forth there when the man came and he said if you God can heal him I'll bow on to your God but he knew that God already showed him that that man that was praying to the son that was made blind he said now father I thank you for showing me now the man receive your sight in the name of Jesus Christ he said you couldn't even he a pend Dr so this word was displayed around manifested amen but what happened they rejected it yes he said but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceeded from the father he shall testify of me and he also shall bear witness because ye have been with me because ye have been with me from the beginning amen aren't we thankful that we have the guide amongst us the guide is here to lead us the guide is here to show us the hour that we are living in amen amen he's preparing us for the treacherous ground that we're walking upon for the treacherous hour that's upon the Earth because we are living in the hour where gross Darkness upon the Earth man is become evil amen man has become haters of the word of God man has become haters of the things of God yes man don't want to hear about God but he glorifies sin amen while sin is being glorified while Satan is being glorified the things of the devil is being glorified Christ is being glorified through his bride amen and how is he being glorified when we are bearing fruits amen how is God glorified when we are bearing fruit when we are becoming fruitful amen so this is our where the church is coming to Perfection amen this is the hour where it's a time now just before the resurrection just to slip in before the resurrection before the gospel goes to the Jews this church is coming to Perfection this church Who had who have been now seated in Heavenly places and be made partakers of the divine nature of God amen amen that she's coming now and walking in Perfection amen she's becoming fruitful bearing for fruits of the spirit what hour we living in amen amen amen he says call yourself Pentecost if you want to he said but where's the god of Pentecost yes that's right he said where is he who appears before them who is it that come down to Paul at night when he was out in the ship and all hopes was gone there every everything was safe and the angel of God and the angel of the Lord come to him said Don't Fear Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and all these that sail with you I give to you that little Jew come out on the deck arms bound down with shackles and across his legs in his chain walked out there shaking his hand saying be of good courage amen what was it angel of God who servant I am stood by me last night saying don't fear Paul and S I believe God that it will be just the way he told it to me yes sir what we need is not Pentecost but the god of Pentecost amen you're coming to the Jordan men and women each one of you is coming down to the Jordan I don't know when that may be it may be before Del for some of us but I tell you there's coming a time that when you're going to need more than an old M eaten robe of some church you're going to need the god that sent the Church of fire in his early days amen you're going to have to have the vision that they had in the early days that was this but the new schools has coming and the old that eat been eat it and the doubts and Superstition and theologies and things till the thing is no good at all he said call for the god of Pentecost that that's what we need today truly he said the servant of God has to call on God he has to depend on God not his church not his robe he has to depend on God God asking him to do the impossible so we walking on certain [Music] grounds God God is asking you to turn a corner and you're wondering this is how are we going to turn this corner but you're calling on God amen amen and he's the one that's the guide that's leading you amen you've got to call on God for power of God to perform the impossible if we be the messiah's servant we have to have the messiah's power amen amen if Jesus raised the dead we must raise the dead heal the sick we must do the same because why he's working in and through the many member body doing the Greater Works amen that's how you're going to be fruitful when you are producing the life when you are showing the same life that was in the vine you are now showing it to the fruits that you bear amen and he promised it to us I am the vine ye the branches he said I energize every branch that brings forth fruits amen hallelujah there you are there it is yes sir he says I energize the branch that bring forth fruit amen yes he says in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says when he was here on Earth he said I am the vine ye are the branches and the vine does not bear fruit the brine the branch bears fruit the vine only make energy for the branch you see if you're not abiding in him if you're not connected with him how are you going to get energy to grow to come to maturity in his hour amen you know what you know who was the connection between this it's the Holy Spirit the holy spirit makes sure we and the word connect together that we can come under operation amen amen the Holy Spirit bring the same word and brings life to it amen then the Bible say the letter kill us but the spirit give it life amen yes amen and he brings us together with his word showing that we must produce that same life again amen what we are Messiahs on the Earth again amen showing us that you are Sons and Daughters of God showing us you are the God man on the earth I'm bringing you back to your original condition because while you're part of the original seed amen so I'm bringing you back to what what was fallen in the Garden of Eden I'm restoring you back there amen what is restoration taking is a complete restoration yes amen when we thought the resoration just came and restored the word no he's restoring us amen because what is a complete adoption when even this body becomes changed but right now before we come to the body chain he's bringing us back to Dominion again bringing us back to the same things that Jesus did amen the things that Adam lost is bringing us back to that again that must happen before the body change amen so in between the body change and where we are right now we've coming to Dominion now we comeing to sunship amen we comeing to full Authority amen amen amen the one that will say speak to this mountain yeah so now if we call ourselves are he says the vine only makes energy for the branch and if you went out into the field down here in the river bottom and found a pumpkin vine you'd expect that pumpkin to be Bing pumpkins and if you found a what watermelon it should be bearing watermelons if it's a grape vine it Bears grapes because the life is in the vine pressing forth grape juice or grape life or watermelon life into the branch and the branch is producing what the vine is energizing for now we call ourself Christians and we are the Christian church then we should be bearing the same type of fruit that the vine bore when he was here for he said I am the vine here the branches if you abide in me and my word in you ask what you will it will be done for you and the branch cannot live unless it bu in the vine now if it's a good healthy Branch the branch if it's not healthy something is wrapped around it cut of the energy sooner soon the pruner comes by and cuts that Branch off yes and then is destroyed and then today after okay now it'll be 2,000 something years and we thought that Jesus is not dead but is alive do you believe that amen we are seeing it in present time if Jesus was dead then how did we get here if Jesus was dead how did this message go around the world Amen a onean Ministry taking this word how can this one man Ministry message how can his message go around the worlds in the jungles in the Amazon in the mous areas to every tribe and nation and they can believe what you and I are believing because it's the work of the Holy Ghost amen amen and if they got the if they are drawing from the same Vine oh yes then they and they are the branches the true branch that come forth then they must produce the fruit amen they must produce the same fruit amen the message so we would see Jesus he says when talking about the same scripture when in John 15 he said I am the vine here the branches now the vine doesn't bear fruit it's a branch you know that you people here you grape graes and so forth now if that first branch that come out of the vine produced a book of Acts behind it that first church if that vine ever put for another another Branch it'll write another books of Acts behind it did it put forth yes he did is the life yeah yes it did it is so there must be the same works that was done in the book of Acts is being done now did they have the angel of God appearing before them did we have the angel of God appearing before us have we seen miracles signs and wonders have we seen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen and is this word now stimulating us amen is his word becoming Lively to us amen is this word becoming more I should I say more the word progressing amongst us amen more light is being shown week after week amen then is now producing another book of Acts amen for the very life that in the vine brings forth into into the branch so we're not just going back to Pentecost amen we had a Pentecostal experience but we are going beyond that amen because now we're coming to our proper Dominion amen we come to our full Authority because that must happen just before the body change and all this cannot happen if you're not drawing from the vine but if you're drawing from the vine the Bible is a new book to you amen the Bible becomes so real to you things that quotes that you've been reading all the time through the years scriptures that you've been reading through the years has now become a reality to you absolutely am because now you look at it Through The Eyes of God's word amen because the faith of Jesus Christ is in you you are now began to see your own self in the scriptures you are now walking out of the scriptures Hallelujah and you saying here am I I'm I'm here in this scripture I'm here in that scripture this mystery this shadow that was revealed there that was me this this shadow in Joseph this shadow in eser this shadow in Ruth all done through the Bible I can see me this Shadow amen that are locked up in the Seven Locks of Samson I can see it through the Bible there Shadow locked up in Gideon I can seed amen yes amen amen and you begin to see yourself and what it does it makes you walk in perfect Faith because why what why you walk in perfect Faith there is no fear in love yes because now you are part of him amen you know your end results you know the end results yes you know that now you're about to have a body change thank you the final adoption of the body amen where we going to have we with the Redemption of our body but before that we know where we are right now because we know we can feel the some we can feel the tug amen we can feel that something is drawing now amen what is that something is drawing us to the other side something is drawing us amen something is drawing us for the body change we are now about entering there through the word to the stimulation of Revelation that we receiving amen today the very word that we feasting upon one of these days is going to give us the body change if you don't feel that if you can't feel the tag then there's something wrong amen then you got to check then there got to be a pruning time because you got to be fruitful in this hour amen you cannot be just bearing fruit you got to be fruitful amen because the same fruit you bear will wither away but you need to become fruitful and produce and produce amen there has to be a continuous growth you cannot remain stagnant in his work yes amen there must be a good report that T must give a reports the chor is coming week after week in your home in your workplace and is showing you the word he's guiding you amen he's shooting you bringing you now showing that now this son and daughter of God they are able to handle the words I have confidence in them that they can handle the word they can take this word and speak amen but now as a child you wouldn't know this word this word only be reveal to you you can't remain as a child and say I don't know the Bible I don't understand these things 20 10 years in the message 20 years in the message and you say no I don't understand these things there's something wrong with your work you need to get back and draw from the vine amen that's why God has given the five4 ministry to bring the people to the level amen the five4 ministry is not there to preach over your heads yeah the fivefold ministry is depending on the Holy Spirit to feed the people amen the TR 54 Ministry is always dependent on the Holy Spirit you know before a preacher come and preach here a true 5 is very nervous he's a nervous rck because he's dependent on the Holy Spirit to minister to the hearts of the people Amen to to to he he knows that the Holy Spirit can discern the hearts he knows the Holy Spirit has the rightful ingredients the spiritual food that they need to sustain them yes Lord to give them a growth in the hour no true Minister want to come here and see the people same yes year after year still the same some people even gone withering away because that's what happened there was a great Exodus out they couldn't produce there wasn't drawing from the vine they were grafted in amen and they wooded away yes but we want to see a fruitful bride amen amen a fruitful bride last scripture Isaiah 51 book of Isaiah 51 he says now I will sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his Vineyard my well beloved had a Vineyard in a very fruitful yell and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof oh didn't he put his edge around us yes amen didn't he didn't leave us under those broken systems he didn't leave us with the of the world he didn't leave us in the chicken Barnard he took us up as Eagles took us up on the Y amen he made us to be seated in Heavenly places yes amen amen and he put his edge around us that was the covering of the word amen and he gaed took away our Stony Hearts he took away all the things that was hardening us yes yes and planted it with the choices Vine and built a tower in the midst of it thank amen oh Watchmen what of the light thereof yes did he put Watchman before us amen and also made a Vine press therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes amen and it brought forth wild grapes oh stimulation of Revelation and now inhabitance of Jerusalem and Men of Judah judge I pray you bet me and my vard what could have been done more to my vard that I have done not done in the it or what more could be done that he didn't do already sent a prophet around the world with such great manifestations taken this world around the world what more must he do for us amen he given us the opening of the words amen he's given us all of his words yes he's given us all of the promises amen all that was in God reporting to Christ all that was in Christ reporting to his church amen but he's speaking here to to Israel he said what could have been done more to myard that have that I have not done in it wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes and now go to I'll tell you what I will do to my vard I will take away the edge thereof you see

a taste of Leia you want to be influenced by Leia 200 million demons they can be very influential yes they know how to get to you demon powers know how to get to people but he only can get to you when you leave the word yes when you leave the word and you want to remain in a backing condition in a time when about to take a Rapture people don't want to come and worship God in the time when we about to have a body ch change people not interested in the things of God and worried about how much they can achieve in this life what he's telling us he'll take the edge there off and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall off and it shall be thren down now trust me none of God's children will be lost but you will chastise you won't be lost if you predestinated but doesn't mean he won't deal with you God will deal with you because he won't lose none of his amen he didn't die in vain amen none of his will be lost but if he has to deal with you he will deal with you and that's why you find sometimes people going in the back condition and year of things happening happening to the families happening to them until they go and repent and make things right yes and now will lay it waste and it shall not be PR no dig but there shall come up briers and Thorns that also command the clowns that no that they rain no rain upon it for the vineyard of the lord of the host is the house of Israel and the men of Judah is Pleasant planets last quote he said now yeah now he is here he promised to be here and now the only way that he can work is by his promise I am the viney and the branches and the branches bear record that a life is coming from the vine where he doesn't have any life in it but if it's energized by the life it's got the same life that the vine has got it's compelling itself or pushing itself up to the branch amen so if we are in him sorry one more quote he said but now we said see he said and in this day of unbelief and superstitions and all kinds of Creeds yet you're
