[29:26] the world Amen amen amen because I know
[29:30] what it is to go to nightclubs on a New

[29:45] mature young brothers and sisters that's
[29:48] going to take this Bon on that's going
[29:51] to move this church
[29:53] forward but what I encourage your
[29:55] brothers and sisters
[29:58] is not to be influenced by the world and
[30:02] I say this because it was my biggest
[30:05] struggle Amen brother son Sam Sons
[30:08] brother Joshua's

[37:44] even when we didn't ask for it he's done
[37:46] wonderful things for us am and um today
[37:51] um I think you all know my testimony how
[37:54] the Lord had so good to jayen and I um

[38:14] you know it's only the grace of God um
[38:16] people go people have accidents and it
[38:19] takes them a long time to recover but we
[38:22] are we are well and I believe that's
[38:24] only the grace of God Upon Us amen
[38:27] today I'm going to be sharing um
[38:28] testimony with you it's actually not my
[38:30] testimony it's Janice's testimony and uh
[38:33] I just want to thank the Lord on her
[38:36] behalf and and she's trying to come
[38:38] forward but uh I'm just going to share
[38:41] for you um with you how uh the Lord uh
[38:45] has been with her and made a way for her
[38:49] so um Janise studied um through dut and
[38:53] when it was time for her to graduate she
[38:56] couldn't complete her 6 months
[38:58] internship because it was Co and the
[39:01] companies that she could have got an
[39:03] internship with were not taking people
[39:06] in because people were working from home
[39:08] and things like that and the time went
[39:12] and she couldn't get an internship and
[39:15] during that time my dad was very ill and
[39:18] um he was at home bu recovering from his
[39:22] operation and things like that and jice
[39:25] was the only one who could do certain
[39:27] things for my dad so when he he had
[39:30] difficulty breathing she would go and
[39:32] cup his chest and help him um you know
[39:35] alleviate the pressure on his lung and
[39:38] things like that and as the months went
[39:41] and she would also help in the shop and
[39:43] things like that months went by an
[39:45] entire year went by J didn't get an
[39:47] internship and she would always say mom
[39:49] you know am I ever going to graduate
[39:51] because without this internship I'll
[39:53] never be able to graduate I'll never get
[39:55] a I'll never get myself certificate so
[39:57] that I can apply for jobs and I would
[39:59] always tell her and we' always talk
[40:00] about it and say look we think that the
[40:02] reason there's this delay is because you
[40:04] need to be at home you have a purpose to
[40:07] fulfill and when the time is right God
[40:10] will provide you with your hearts
[40:12] desire and as the time went and I could
[40:16] see the the discouragement in jise the
[40:20] the frustration and I kept telling her
[40:22] you know there's a reason for everything
[40:25] and God has a plan for you you just have
[40:28] to believe you just have to be positive
[40:30] and everything's going to be
[40:32] fine um at some point I took her for an
[40:35] interview with uh one of the shipping
[40:38] companies and she came out of there and
[40:40] said Mom those people were so horrible
[40:42] and you know I I I can't work there I
[40:45] can't go there hope they don't even call
[40:46] me back and I said look if it's meant
[40:49] for you and if it's God's plan for you
[40:52] it's going to happen so we carried on
[40:55] and then out of the blue last year a
[40:58] company called her for an interview and
[41:01] I was so skeptical because I never heard
[41:03] of the the ca or this uh institution so
[41:06] I did some research and I said okay it
[41:08] looks it is a legitimate institution
[41:10] let's go we went for the interview she
[41:12] got the
[41:14] internship and it was always my desire
[41:16] that jise gets placed at a very
[41:18] reputable company when she has a
[41:20] internship because it makes more sense
[41:24] and it so happened that she got a very
[41:26] reputable company and she completed her
[41:30] six months
[41:32] internship and when she completed a six
[41:34] month months internship they offered her
[41:37] a further oneyear
[41:39] learnership and
[41:41] um she eventually graduated and she not
[41:45] only graduated I think many of you saw
[41:48] her she graduated in celebration she was
[41:51] interviewed by the media her picture was
[41:53] all over the newspapers and you know um
[41:58] it's not something that we expected she
[42:00] graduated with Kumi she had many
[42:03] distinctions amen um her passing with
[42:07] that also resulted in us getting um the
[42:10] discount we had most of our fees paid
[42:13] back to us and uh you know Hallelujah
[42:16] all these delays brought uh so much of
[42:19] the things to us and then during her her
[42:24] learnership you know uh she just an
[42:26] article and she decided to apply for a
[42:28] position she went for the interview she
[42:30] came back home and said Mom I was so
[42:32] nervous and I don't even know what I was
[42:34] saying and I'm never getting this job
[42:37] and I said to her look whatever it is
[42:39] whether you're nervous or you did bad if
[42:41] it's God's plan you will get the job and
[42:44] she has got the job in fact she had to
[42:47] terminate her learnership with with the
[42:49] other company in order to get a job and
[42:52] we give God all the praise and honor and
[42:55] I also thank God for her because every
[42:57] day when I pick her up and when she
[42:59] talks about her
[43:00] experiences um she always tells me you
[43:03] know Mom God is so good to me I don't
[43:05] know why God is so good to me and I
[43:08] always tell her that just appreciate it
[43:10] and give glory to
[43:12] godah you know uh we are just so blessed
[43:16] and we just thank God for everything
[43:18] he's done for us amen and um yeah we are
[43:21] truly grateful thank
[43:25] you
[43:28] amen amen we call S CN
[43:44] forward amen I greet you in the precious
[43:46] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[43:49] amen finally that I would come after uh
[43:51] sister elain who had a hectic accident
[43:55] we were also in my kids and I I didn't
[43:58] want to share this but I thought no the
[44:01] angel of the Lord was definitely with us
[44:03] this day and uh funny enough Zion
[44:07] normally sits on the passenger behind
[44:10] the passenger seat but this particular
[44:13] day he decided no he wants to sit almost
[44:15] on utm's lap and utum saying mommy Zion
[44:20] is pushing me against the car please
[44:23] like let him move so I'm like Zion
[44:25] please move but Zion is refusing to move
[44:28] and as we so I said just leave him man
[44:31] he wants to sit there so as we left I
[44:35] see this car
[44:37] parked like few meters away from the
[44:39] robot he's not moving so as we I'm
[44:42] coming there's two lanes for us and two
[44:44] lanes for the oncoming traffic so as I
[44:47] pass him he decides now he needs to move
[44:51] so what told me was the car just li like
[44:56] went forward and I thought this guy
[44:58] didn't put in his clutch he just started
[45:00] his car and the car Jed like
[45:03] forward and then he didn't wait for me
[45:06] to like pass him and he into my uh you
[45:10] know the bachel cap
[45:12] is and it happened in slow motion
[45:15] because first we hear the the knock then
[45:18] the car like sways this
[45:20] way and I'm saying Autumn that that's
[45:23] our car because now we we this way now
[45:27] so then I moved and I stopped and I'm
[45:30] thinking Lord please I don't want to be
[45:32] in the situation right now I have things
[45:34] to do I need to be somewhere anyway so I
[45:38] got out and this drunk man black man
[45:41] gets out of his car I'm so sorry and his
[45:45] hands are out and he wants to hug and I
[45:47] don't know what he wants to do I said
[45:49] sir please this is not the time to hug
[45:51] or do stuff now you bumped my car so he
[45:56] says oh but I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I
[45:57] said just hold on I need to check the
[45:59] damage on my car before we converse and
[46:02] so I checked the damage and funny enough
[46:05] the bump was so loud but nothing no dent
[46:10] on my car no scratches nothing the kids
[46:13] are okay I'm fine so I walk back and I
[46:16] look at his car his light is hanging the

[52:25] amen
[52:26] that the Lord knows the plans that he
[52:28] has for us amen amen so I like just to
[52:32] bless the Lord give him thanks for
[52:35] another year that he seen us through
[52:38] amen I want you to sing a song but we
[52:40] running out of time and I thought it
[52:42] would be more important just to share a
[52:44] few
[52:45] testimonies um just to encourage you and
[52:48] uplift your faith amen so you all know
[52:51] the testimony that I shared uh earlier
[52:53] on this year
[52:55] um when Judah was born how that before
[52:59] uh he was born that the doctors told us
[53:02] that whil in the home he is having
[53:04] problems
[53:05] growing and we brought the need before
[53:08] the church at that point um was 2 days
[53:14] before Judah was born that um he was
[53:18] only about
[53:19] 2.1 uh CES at that time and after we
[53:23] prayed the church and we trusted to
[53:26] God in the space of one day he grew from
[53:30] 2.1 to
[53:32] 2.7 kgs in the space of one day
[53:36] something that he was struggling to do
[53:37] for weeks but after prayer and believing
[53:40] God in the space of one day he grew and
[53:44] I shared with you how you know in the
[53:47] beginning of the year when Pastor Adrian
[53:48] spoke about the year 23 and how uh Mark
[53:52] 11:23 is our scripture and now Judah
[53:55] which is praise is tied in with that and
[53:58] it just Co not coincidentally but by the
[54:00] Lord orchestrating it Judo was born at
[54:03] around
[54:05] 1123 he's the 23rd grandchild U great
[54:09] grandchild my granny and if you take the
[54:13] number he has 2.73
[54:16] kgs that adds up to amen I can't
[54:20] remember the exact K is now but it added
[54:22] up exactly to 11 because he has born in
[54:26] the 11th Hour amen so I just like to
[54:29] thank the Lord once again for that but
[54:32] more importantly whilst we were there in
[54:34] and and Judah was born the nurse came in
[54:37] and the nurse was a bit um you know
[54:40] upset saying that you know she's not
[54:42] happy with the condition of the baby
[54:44] seems like he's struggling to breathe
[54:46] and she went into to try and get the
[54:48] pediatrition urgently and at that point
[54:51] when she walked out I turned to uh
[54:53] Sister Kim and I said you know don't
[54:55] stress I'm just going to pray and I went
[54:57] over the baby and instead of praying um
[55:00] if I can remember the correct words now
[55:02] I said Judah you're the son of the most
[55:05] high God now let your lungs breathe amen
[55:07] and I didn't realize that the nurse was
[55:09] walking in just behind me like a second
[55:11] after I said those words and she just
[55:13] came in and said you know everything
[55:15] just seems fine now I don't know what
[55:17] happened everything is just perfectly
[55:19] fine and now as I said he was starting
[55:22] with 11:23 but here's the manifestation
[55:24] now 11:23 when we speak the word amen
[55:28] and uh you know I was thinking about
[55:29] something uh quite funny uh at work we
[55:32] have something called book meetings
[55:34] which means work in progress where the
[55:36] boss wants to sit with you and go
[55:38] through all the masses that he gave you
[55:39] and and see how far ahead the matters
[55:42] have gone and whenever they have those
[55:45] kind of meetings I I I hesitate and I
[55:47] don't like it when they have those
[55:48] meetings because I like to do my work in
[55:50] my own time I don't like to be told when
[55:53] my work must be done and all of those
[55:54] things
[55:55] so whenever they announce that they're
[55:57] having those meetings I just cancel
[55:59] those meetings when I say I cancel it I
[56:02] mean I speak the word and I say that
[56:03] this meeting is not going to happen and
[56:06] they don't know how but somehow those
[56:08] meetings always get a Jour whenever I
[56:10] speak the word and I say I don't want to
[56:12] have this meeting now it's it's been
[56:14] happening for quite a few times and I
[56:15] just laugh about it every time because
[56:18] we can control circumstances around us
[56:21] we don't realize how powerful that is
[56:24] Sir because we only want to apply now
[56:25] the things of God to spiritual things
[56:28] but you see God put Adam on the earth
[56:31] not to just apply amen things to his
[56:34] spiritual life but Adam was to be a God
[56:36] on a physical Natural Earth see Adam
[56:39] want to exercise his authority on a
[56:41] physical Natural Earth come on you see
[56:43] so when God gives us these things it's
[56:45] not to be all also spiritual but it's to
[56:48] exercise in our daily lives it's like
[56:51] imagine your father gives you a credit
[56:53] card now and that credit card has a
[56:54] million ran on it and we just sitting
[56:57] with that credit card just deciding no
[56:59] we'll maybe use it once a year maybe
[57:02] sometimes not even use it in the whole
[57:04] the whole entire year but that's what
[57:06] our heavenly father has given us because
[57:08] didn't the prophet say we have a blank
[57:09] check yes sir but now how many times
[57:12] have we used that check this
[57:14] year how many times has the bank of
[57:16] heaven received that check this year
[57:18] from you amen how many times have you
[57:21] received from the Heavenly store room
[57:23] because I can tell you that it's more
[57:25] plentiful than the sto rooms of Egypt
[57:28] amen I can tell you that it's not going
[57:30] to run out because our heavenly father
[57:32] is the inexhaustible Fountain amen we're
[57:35] never going to dry amen his resources
[57:37] out amen so for 2024 I believe 2023 was
[57:41] just a training ground for us I believe
[57:43] all the great Supernatural things that
[57:45] we've started to see is only still in
[57:47] its infancy I believe we're going to see
[57:50] much greater things than that because
[57:52] amen we've read the quotes Missy limbs
[57:54] are going to appear amen the prophet
[57:56] said would we leap over walls amen the
[57:59] things that God has ordained for us to
[58:01] do amen it's for us to do amen because
[58:05] amen there's no denomination church
[58:06] that's going to do it there's no
[58:08] denomination that's going to fulfill the
[58:11] remaining scriptures amen it's only the
[58:13] bride of Christ amen so for it's us to
[58:16] equip ourselves amen how by coming to
[58:18] church by coming to the training camp
[58:21] getting the right training amen building
[58:23] up our faith amen because Satan is out
[58:25] there every day of the week whether it's
[58:27] at work whether it's at school to try
[58:28] and influence us so when we miss a
[58:31] service amen we are missing amen a
[58:34] serious amount of time of
[58:35] training amen because you're not missing
[58:38] anything out in the world when when the
[58:39] enemy is their influencing you you're
[58:41] not missing out on that because you're
[58:42] going to work you're going to school but
[58:44] when you miss out on Church you're
[58:45] missing out Amen on that building up
[58:48] your faith you're missing out on that
[58:50] training amen and more than that amen
[58:52] church is only Sundays and on Wednesday
[58:55] day but more than that we got to equip
[58:56] ourselves during the week amen even if
[58:59] it's during the work meditate upon the
[59:01] Lord amen like David said Thy word have
[59:04] i hidden in my heart that I may not sin
[59:05] against thee amen Jesus told the
[59:08] disciples amen pray that you that you
[59:10] don't fall into
[59:12] temptation amen so these things are Keys
[59:15] amen for us to exercise in the kingdom
[59:18] of God Amen so be grateful amen we thank
[59:21] the Lord for this year he's revealed so
[59:23] much to us amen more than you know we
[59:26] thought all the seals were open we
[59:27] thought we have the open book that
[59:29] there's nothing more that the Lord can
[59:30] reveal to us but he can take the same
[59:32] word that we've been hearing all these
[59:34] years and make it fresh to us amen
[59:37] hallelujah I also like to thank the Lord
[59:39] for amen his hands upon my life when it
[59:41] comes to um Ministry in the word I can
[59:45] say that the Lord has um taken me um
[59:48] through this year in this year greater
[59:50] and greater into his word understanding
[59:52] his word more and more and I like to
[59:54] thank the the Lord for that because it's
[59:55] only the Lord you know sometimes um when
[59:58] Pastor agent asks me to uh Minister you
[1:00:02] know I don't ever get a message just
[1:00:04] like that it's usually in the last day
[1:00:07] or maybe sometimes the day that the Lord
[1:00:09] say to now drop
[1:00:11] inspiration and that's when you know
[1:00:13] that the Lord is leading you because
[1:00:14] you're not just trying to take something
[1:00:16] from your own intellect or something
[1:00:18] that you've learned but you're relying
[1:00:20] upon the Lord so I like to thank the
[1:00:22] Lord for that because we know that the
[1:00:24] Lord has entrusted people to minister
[1:00:27] unto his bride yes sir he's ordained man
[1:00:30] to preach the gospel amen amen and we
[1:00:33] got to respect the various officers we
[1:00:35] respect our pastor we respect the
[1:00:37] various officers in the church because
[1:00:38] that's the way God moves through amen
[1:00:41] amen amen so I pray you have also been
[1:00:43] blessed this year I pray you've also
[1:00:45] been catching on the revelation of how
[1:00:47] God is moving in the hour and you that
[1:00:49] you've not been remaining stagnant but
[1:00:51] that you are pressing forward because if
[1:00:54] God has chosen to reveal these things to
[1:00:56] us it it gives us great responsibility
[1:00:58] amen amen hallelujah I'd like to call
[1:01:01] our brother Joshua at this
[1:01:03] time amen just to say a few words before
[1:01:06] we hand over to our pastor
[1:01:19] Adrian amen I greet you all in the
[1:01:21] lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:01:23] Christ amen you feel the sweet presence
[1:01:26] of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:27] tonight
[1:01:29] amen so just to recap a few things of
[1:01:32] the Year
[1:01:34] 2023 want to start reading a scripture
[1:01:37] book of 2 Chronicles chapter 7 reading
[1:01:41] from chapter 7 reading from verse one it
[1:01:43] says now when Solomon had made an end of
[1:01:47] praying the fire came down from heaven
[1:01:52] and consumed the burnt offering
[1:01:55] and the sacrifices and the glory of the
[1:01:57] Lord fill the house amen somebody says
[1:02:01] the Lord fill the house amen say I am
[1:02:05] the house that the Lord fill somebody
[1:02:08] say I am the house that the Lord has
[1:02:11] filled in the year 2023 amen amen and
[1:02:15] the priest could not enter into the
[1:02:17] house of the Lord because of the glory
[1:02:19] of the Lord and filled the Lord's House
[1:02:21] amen somebody say I am the Lord's House
[1:02:25] Lord amen and when all the children of
[1:02:28] Israel saw out the fire came down and
[1:02:32] the glory of the Lord upon the house
[1:02:35] they bow themselves with their faces to
[1:02:37] the ground upon the pavement and worship
[1:02:40] and praise the Lord saying for his good
[1:02:44] his mercy endureth forever how many of
[1:02:47] you can say his Mercy endured forever
[1:02:50] the Lord has been good to me how many of
[1:02:53] you can say the Lord has been good to my
[1:02:54] family am the Lord has been good to me
[1:02:56] in all circumstances and his Mercy
[1:02:59] endure it
[1:03:01] forever verse four says then the king
[1:03:04] and all the people offered sacrifices
[1:03:06] before the
[1:03:08] Lord that's what we come to do this year
[1:03:10] amen we've come to DED rededicate Our
[1:03:12] Lives amen we've come because there was
[1:03:15] a temple of God there was a time for the
[1:03:19] food the spiritual food that the prophet
[1:03:21] has been preaching was Tau up for the
[1:03:23] special
[1:03:24] season that people the different Stone
[1:03:28] from around the world will be heed down
[1:03:30] brought together to form this mystical
[1:03:32] Body of Christ and we are the temple of
[1:03:35] God Amen but we can say surely in this
[1:03:39] year 2023 we had a visitation from the
[1:03:43] angel of the
[1:03:45] Lord amen the Bible said the prophet of
[1:03:48] God come so our faith can be turned back
[1:03:50] to the faith of the fathers and what
[1:03:53] happened in the book of of facts they to
[1:03:55] wait and car in Jerusalem until they
[1:03:58] were enjoyed with power from on high
[1:04:02] what is power it's the Holy Ghost amen
[1:04:06] we don't have our own power amen it's
[1:04:08] the Holy Ghost in US amen amen it's the
[1:04:11] power of God that does the miracle it's
[1:04:14] the power of God that brings Deliverance
[1:04:16] it's the power of God that brings the
[1:04:18] anointing that breaks the Yoke of
[1:04:20] bondage that is why in this year 2023
[1:04:22] you'll find in many families in all our
[1:04:24] home we found that people that were in
[1:04:27] bondage those things those Yoles were
[1:04:29] broken amen because why the anointing
[1:04:31] has come down and it's the angel of God
[1:04:34] that brought forth the anointing amen
[1:04:36] and how he's bringing forth the
[1:04:37] anointing through the five-fold ministry
[1:04:40] amen bringing the same word amen and now
[1:04:43] it's shedding light on the same word
[1:04:46] we've had this word all these years but
[1:04:47] now the Holy Ghost comes down bringing
[1:04:50] the Dynamics amen
[1:04:53] amen
[1:04:55] verse 5 says and King Solomon offered a
[1:04:57] sacrifice of
[1:05:00] 22,000 sheep so the king and all the
[1:05:02] people dedicated the house of God and
[1:05:04] the priests waited on their offices the
[1:05:07] levite also instruments of music of the
[1:05:09] Lord which David the king had made to
[1:05:11] praise the Lord because his Mercy
[1:05:14] endured forever and that's what we've
[1:05:16] been doing amen giving praise to our God
[1:05:20] Amen when David praised by the ministry
[1:05:22] and the priest sounded trumpets before
[1:05:24] them and all Israel stood moreover
[1:05:27] Solomon hallowed the middle of the court
[1:05:30] that was before the house of the Lord
[1:05:32] for there he offered burnt offerings and
[1:05:34] the fat of the peace offerings because
[1:05:37] of bra of the Brazen because the Brazen
[1:05:39] altar which Solomon had made was not
[1:05:42] able to receive the burnt offerings and
[1:05:44] the meat offerings and the fat also at
[1:05:46] the same time Solomon kept the feast
[1:05:49] seven days and all Israel with him a
[1:05:53] very great congre congregation from the
[1:05:55] entering in of ID unto the river Egypt
[1:05:58] and in the eth day they made a solemn
[1:06:03] assembly for they kept the dedication of
[1:06:05] the altar seven days and the feast 7
[1:06:09] days and on the
[1:06:11] three and 20th day amen yes listen to
[1:06:17] the scripture now and on the three and
[1:06:20] 20th day that's the 23rd day of the
[1:06:23] seventh month
[1:06:24] amen he sent the people away into the
[1:06:28] tents glad and merry not for the
[1:06:32] goodness that the Lord had showed unto
[1:06:35] David and to Solomon and to Israel is
[1:06:39] people amen amen so in this year 2023
[1:06:44] the Lord has been good to us am amen was
[1:06:48] a rededication of our life bringing us
[1:06:50] back to the altar coming back to
[1:06:52] consecration again and when the life was
[1:06:54] consecrated again what happened the Shak
[1:06:56] of Glory comes down upon who upon us the
[1:07:01] temple of God Amen we are the temple of
[1:07:04] God because why Jesus Christ must dwell
[1:07:07] in us and the world now must see the
[1:07:10] resurrected Jesus Christ to us so if
[1:07:13] anybody ask you where is Jesus is Jesus
[1:07:16] in me the hope of glory amen because
[1:07:19] that is why we come to die to self so
[1:07:21] it's not I that live it it is Christ
[1:07:23] that deled in us so as we recap this
[1:07:26] year the Lord has been good to us we
[1:07:28] identified that it is the Angel of the
[1:07:31] Lord that been with us in many
[1:07:33] circumstances we have identified to the
[1:07:35] grace of God the digital Footprints of
[1:07:38] the Angel of the Lord that you was tied
[1:07:40] to the number 23 amen and you seen
[1:07:43] supernaturally in many circumstances in
[1:07:45] every home in the
[1:07:47] church is brought forth healing amen
[1:07:51] this is all under the third pool now
[1:07:52] because the has come down you may ask
[1:07:55] how is discernment here through the
[1:07:57] preaching of the word you know that your
[1:07:59] need was spoken through you know that
[1:08:00] through the preaching of the word the
[1:08:02] Lord has been Discerning your your needs
[1:08:04] he's been speaking to each one of you in
[1:08:07] every circumstances in every area of
[1:08:09] your life from the small to the middle
[1:08:12] age the to the whole to everybody yes
[1:08:15] amen but the greatest Miracles that he
[1:08:17] done this year he's been restoring the
[1:08:20] Holy Ghost back into families back into
[1:08:23] individual Liv lives Amen in our person
[1:08:26] in our family Josephine had a personal
[1:08:28] experience from the Lord we had our
[1:08:30] brother Noah had a personal experience
[1:08:31] from the Lord am amen we've had Miracles
[1:08:34] we have people speaking the word yes and
[1:08:37] things were coming to pass amen we saw
[1:08:39] God clearing Debs amen we saw sicknesses
[1:08:42] all types of sicknesses God has seen
[1:08:45] them through people have been getting
[1:08:47] jobs we seen God in every area of Our
[1:08:50] Lives amen but what is he been doing is
[1:08:54] preparing us because why we are the
[1:08:57] temple where the glory of the Lord has
[1:08:58] come now to dwell in and we are the
[1:09:01] people that he wants to use now to go
[1:09:04] and possess the gates of the enemy amen
[1:09:08] for we are the people that he says Thou
[1:09:10] must prophesy again before Nation
[1:09:12] tongues and King we are the people who
[1:09:15] will have to represent Jesus Christ to
[1:09:17] this dying generation to this world
[1:09:20] without hope to this world that's in
[1:09:23] darkness to the world that is that is in
[1:09:25] chaos right now they need to see the
[1:09:28] Living God the resurrected Jesus amen
[1:09:31] and he's going to work in and through
[1:09:34] his body amen and the Lord has been good
[1:09:37] to us and surely we can say his mercy
[1:09:39] and J forever amen prophet of God I just
[1:09:42] want to read a quote it
[1:09:48] says Solomon was a four type of Christ
[1:09:51] in that he buil the Temple and so forth
[1:09:54] and then in that age God gave Solomon a
[1:09:57] gift and all of Israel recognized that
[1:10:01] gift and all Israel prospered under the
[1:10:06] reign of that
[1:10:07] gift but if they had not have believed
[1:10:11] that gift that God sent through
[1:10:14] Solomon then they would not have
[1:10:17] prospered they wouldn't have recognized
[1:10:19] it and they when God sent this great
[1:10:22] marvelous gift all Israel
[1:10:25] flourish amen and you find that when God
[1:10:29] has sent his gift which is the Holy
[1:10:31] Ghost amen come our
[1:10:33] way everybody flourishes under that amen
[1:10:37] and they became the mighty nation of the
[1:10:39] Earth because they recognize the gift of
[1:10:42] God that was in Solomon so what was in
[1:10:44] Solomon it was the gift of God which is
[1:10:46] the Holy Ghost everyone with one art and
[1:10:50] one Accord was testifying of this great
[1:10:53] gift not of the great Solomon the great
[1:10:56] gift in Solomon amen it's not the holy
[1:11:00] people it's the holy spirit in the
[1:11:03] people not the holy church but the holy
[1:11:06] God of the church amen as Peter referred
[1:11:10] the Holy Mountain it was not the holy
[1:11:12] mount it was the holy God that was on
[1:11:14] the mountain and Solomon was just a man
[1:11:18] that God had for you and give him a
[1:11:20] great wonderful gift and when Israel saw
[1:11:23] that it was it truly was the gift of God
[1:11:27] every one of them red to him that was
[1:11:30] made the Revival and we know the prophet
[1:11:32] preacher message is greater than Solomon
[1:11:34] is yet amen and how many of you can say
[1:11:37] in this day it happened in the prophet's
[1:11:40] time how many if you can say right now a
[1:11:42] greater than Solomon is here he's here
[1:11:45] amongst us amen the same angel of God
[1:11:47] that was with the prophet is here
[1:11:49] amongst us doing the great Great and
[1:11:53] Mighty Works amen because why this bride
[1:11:56] must do the Greater Works before we we
[1:11:59] about to leave the earth now yes one of
[1:12:01] these days we're going to leave here but
[1:12:03] before we leave on the earth there must
[1:12:05] be an impact and that's what all is is
[1:12:08] preparing was for these things that we
[1:12:10] are seeing here are only there's still
[1:12:13] more to come amen because why before we
[1:12:16] leave we must impact the Earth it must
[1:12:21] whatever we whatever is going to happen
[1:12:23] is going to impact the Earth in such a
[1:12:24] way that it will reach Israel because
[1:12:27] when Moses and Elijah com down the news
[1:12:29] must go out that there was a people on
[1:12:31] the Earth Hallelujah God was with them
[1:12:34] amen God works through them amen and
[1:12:37] they have left the earth a supernatural
[1:12:40] people they was a super race an
[1:12:42] invincible Army that's the message that
[1:12:44] will end up in Israel amen I pray that
[1:12:47] God going to 20 2024 I pray the Lord
[1:12:50] richly bless every one of you from my
[1:12:53] family to yours I pray the Lord bless
[1:12:55] every one of you in your homes I pray
[1:12:57] that as the Lord has been restoring
[1:12:59] families together he's been restoring
[1:13:01] the family altar you know a supernatural
[1:13:04] things can take place in a family altar
[1:13:07] yes I receive my healing in the family
[1:13:09] altar amen something that might seem so
[1:13:12] simple is just a family altar but on on
[1:13:15] this one specific night while having the
[1:13:18] family
[1:13:20] Altar and and the prayer was finished
[1:13:23] and the wife looked at me and she start
[1:13:26] and she walked towards me and I
[1:13:28] recognized that this was not a normal
[1:13:31] look that she gave me and I discerned
[1:13:33] that this was the angel of God present
[1:13:36] amen and when she came I just raised my
[1:13:38] hand because I knew what was going to
[1:13:40] happen and she prayed for me and I asked
[1:13:43] her what made you do that she couldn't
[1:13:45] understand herself what made her come
[1:13:47] towards me it was the angel of the Lord
[1:13:50] so every s situation in this church as
[1:13:52] well when I when I've listened to the
[1:13:54] people's testimony I've recognized that
[1:13:56] it was the angel of the Lord that was
[1:13:58] doing these things amen it's a
[1:14:01] coincidental brother mvin was burdened
[1:14:03] for the young people in our family altar
[1:14:06] we mentioned brother mvin I was I was
[1:14:08] mentioning to the
[1:14:09] children about brother mvin as an
[1:14:12] example of how God supernaturally
[1:14:14] intervened in his life and transformed
[1:14:16] his life taken him out of the world and
[1:14:19] brought him to this marvelous message
[1:14:21] that how it couldn't be him that would
[1:14:22] receive this message had it not been for
[1:14:24] the grace of God Amen he had to be
[1:14:27] predestinated so God does Supernatural
[1:14:30] things but the greatest thing that he
[1:14:31] can do when he can take a person and
[1:14:33] transform his life by his transforming
[1:14:36] power I was actually telling speaking to
[1:14:38] the boys about you brother M telling
[1:14:40] them how giving them an example of your
[1:14:43] life and I was just sharing with them
[1:14:45] this last night and coincidentally the
[1:14:47] Lord has been burdening your heart to
[1:14:49] speak to young people so God knows how
[1:14:52] to put things together amen nothing is
[1:14:54] done by coincidence we thank God for his
[1:14:56] grace we thank God for the year 2023
[1:14:59] just one quick testimony how we I know
[1:15:02] we always spoke about how the Lord we
[1:15:04] identifi these digital prints how he
[1:15:06] works with the number 23 so during the
[1:15:08] course of this year I was at the
[1:15:09] shooting range and you normally shoot on
[1:15:13] a total of
[1:15:15] 25 so we did a warm up
[1:15:18] shooting and before the the shooting I

[1:15:37] knew how to shoot
[1:15:39] so anyway and I just said a simple
[1:15:42] prayer like that so we did the warm-up
[1:15:45] shoot and we challeng the scores and you
[1:15:48] know what my score was on the board
[1:15:50] there was 23 out of 25

[1:16:54] God richly bless every one of you as we
[1:16:56] entering the new year as we took the
[1:16:58] time this year to reconsecrate our life
[1:17:00] to dedicate our life we've seen the
[1:17:01] supernatural because of that amen amen
[1:17:04] he said if you humble yourself my people
[1:17:06] could humble themselves and call upon my
[1:17:08] name amen and repent of all his sins
[1:17:11] surely he will come and heal the land
[1:17:13] amen and we've seen the hand of God upon
[1:17:15] every one of us if we continue to do
[1:17:17] these things amen work out your own
[1:17:20] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:17:23] because it's there's coming a time of
[1:17:24] economic crisis it happened in the
[1:17:26] ministry of Elisha Elisha had the double
[1:17:29] portion but and he lived in the time
[1:17:32] when there was economic crisis there's
[1:17:34] coming a time let me tell you something
[1:17:36] now all the training ground that you've
[1:17:38] been through is only preparing you for
[1:17:40] what's coming on the earth amen because
[1:17:42] it's coming a time when you're not going
[1:17:43] to cry you're going to recognize the
[1:17:45] authority within you you're going to
[1:17:47] recognize your sunship you're going to
[1:17:49] recognize that you got dominion and the
[1:17:52] power of God is in you you and you're
[1:17:53] going to speak the word you're not going
[1:17:55] to cry you're going to speak with
[1:17:58] confidence amen amen because why when
[1:18:00] the when you have the faith of God which
[1:18:02] is walking in perfect Faith by you
[1:18:04] recognizing who you are and what the
[1:18:06] scripture says about you you're going to
[1:18:08] speak to your circumstances you want to
[1:18:10] speak and God and the things are going
[1:18:13] to come to pass from what you speak God
[1:18:16] will honor the things that you speak
[1:18:18] because why you are a son and daughter
[1:18:21] of God so when you hear about the
[1:18:23] economic crisis coming on the earth when
[1:18:25] you hear about all the squeeze coming
[1:18:26] about don't be dismayed Be not Afraid
[1:18:29] amen know that the angel of God is
[1:18:32] before you yes amen amen even right now
[1:18:35] Israel fighting the battles they're
[1:18:36] trying to fight their battles it's not
[1:18:38] them that will fight the battle
[1:18:39] eventually they will realize that all
[1:18:41] the world will turn against Israel the
[1:18:43] Army the military will not help them the
[1:18:46] military will not be able to fight the
[1:18:47] whole
[1:18:48] world God himself will have to come and
[1:18:50] fight just like that God is fighting our
[1:18:53] battles he said the battle is his and
[1:18:55] the Victory Is Ours it's the angel of
[1:18:58] God going before us every time Israel
[1:19:00] went they put the hark of the Covenant
[1:19:02] before them yes amen but every time the
[1:19:06] the hark was not there they were
[1:19:07] defeated but when the hark was before
[1:19:09] them they won amen so we pray that the
[1:19:11] Lord will be with each of you the Lord

[1:23:37] yes right there's a waiting to hear what
[1:23:40] he would say to us amen amen I was
[1:23:42] telling brother Caleb earlier if we were
[1:23:44] talking about continuity if you go look
[1:23:46] how we ended December 2022 we spoke on
[1:23:50] the wings of a mighty angel amen and
[1:23:53] then 2023 would come and reveal himself

[1:24:08] that's not just given to
[1:24:10] anybody amen hallelujah amen we greet
[1:24:14] our sister amen here with sister Vanessa

[1:24:29] year but we thank you for coming into
[1:24:31] the house of the Lord to worship Him
[1:24:32] amen I pray you'll be blessed amen
[1:24:34] Romans 8:1 17 reads now if we are
[1:24:38] children then we are HS yes amen and
[1:24:42] that should finish it for
[1:24:43] us imagine if you heir of God Almighty
[1:24:47] the creator of Heaven and the Earth the
[1:24:49] one who owns it
[1:24:50] all you mean you're an air
[1:24:52] yes
[1:24:53] amen now if we are children then we are
[1:24:56] AES HS of God and coair with Christ if
[1:24:59] indeed we share in his sufferings in
[1:25:02] order that we may also share in his
[1:25:04] glory amen
[1:25:07] amen amen hallelujah now you would know
[1:25:10] that Romans 8 is the chapter when it
[1:25:13] when it goes all the way to verse 23
[1:25:15] talking about Creations
[1:25:17] grown but it starts out here identifying
[1:25:21] who we are as sons and daughter of God
[1:25:23] that as Sons and Daughters if we are HS
[1:25:25] we can make a claim that's
[1:25:28] right amen so you see the inspiration is
[1:25:32] not fetch but it's in the
[1:25:36] word if indeed we share in his
[1:25:38] sufferings in order that we may also
[1:25:42] share in his
[1:25:45] glory you can't say about scripture
[1:25:47] that's scriptural amen 2 Corinthians
[1:25:50] 3:7 amen hallelujah
[1:25:53] I had to eliminate one verse one CH one
[1:25:55] chapter I was going to read Because
[1:25:58] brother Joshua took my
[1:26:00] chapter you were stepping into the
[1:26:02] anointing there amen hallelujah 2
[1:26:04] Corinthians 3:7 says now if the ministry
[1:26:08] of death which was engraved in letters
[1:26:10] of stone came with such Glory that the
[1:26:13] Israelites could not gaze at the face of
[1:26:15] Moses because of its fleeting Glory will
[1:26:19] not the ministry of the spirit be even
[1:26:21] more glorious amen
[1:26:24] amen amen amen for if the ministry of
[1:26:29] condemnation was glorious how much more
[1:26:31] glorious is the ministry of
[1:26:33] righteousness amen indeed what was once
[1:26:36] glorious as no glory now in comparison
[1:26:38] to the glory that surpasses it for if
[1:26:42] what was fading away came with Glory how
[1:26:44] much greater is the glory of that which
[1:26:47] endures therefore since we have such a
[1:26:50] hope we are very bold
[1:26:52] we are not like Moses who would put a
[1:26:54] veil over his face to keep the
[1:26:57] Israelites from gazing at the end of
[1:26:58] what was fading away amen you may be
[1:27:00] seated praise the
[1:27:03] [Music]
[1:27:05] Lord amen you know this year we have
[1:27:08] many
[1:27:09] highlights that we can talk about amen
[1:27:13] but I was trying to summarize for you
[1:27:15] early in the morning service and tell
[1:27:16] you if there's anything you remember
[1:27:18] about 23 it's how the angel came to us
[1:27:23] yes amen amen amen it's very notable
[1:27:28] Hallelujah and you would note yeah why
[1:27:32] I'm saying this is because a prophet is
[1:27:34] without
[1:27:36] honor right you know the
[1:27:39] scripture and if you hear Brother mvin
[1:27:42] sentiments he's somebody who's not part
[1:27:44] of every week's
[1:27:46] service so he would pick up on things
[1:27:48] that you wouldn't pick
[1:27:50] up amen
[1:27:53] but if you really understood what he was
[1:27:55] saying he was telling you the movie is
[1:27:58] on my Lord mov
[1:28:00] on Amen praise the Lord so we appreciate
[1:28:03] you brother Marvin you're welcome to
[1:28:04] spend every year here with us no problem
[1:28:07] amen hallelujah you know Sister Amanda

[1:28:11] and when she arrived on Sunday last week
[1:28:13] briani was
[1:28:15] provided amen so brother mvin you got
[1:28:18] any needs just tell sister Amanda to
[1:28:19] speak amen praise the Lord you know we
[1:28:21] have great woman of faith I said we got
[1:28:24] great woman of faith in the church God
[1:28:26] has risen great woman of Faith amen and
[1:28:29] one of the highlights for me this year
[1:28:30] was we were doing some Outreach and out
[1:28:33] of that Outreach came sister Michelle
[1:28:34] and her family back to church let's give
[1:28:36] the Lord a great hand of Praise amen and
[1:28:39] I'm asking you amen hallelujah to raise
[1:28:41] an
[1:28:42] altar I'll teach you about raising an
[1:28:44] altar amen at another C but we've got to
[1:28:46] raise an altar amen for the total
[1:28:49] Deliverance of brother Denver and I'm
[1:28:51] putting it out before the church because
[1:28:53] if you got nothing else to pray for you
[1:28:54] pray for him yes amen that he'll receive
[1:28:57] total Deliverance in the name of Jesus
[1:28:58] Christ amen hallelujah you believe you
[1:29:01] have the power of the spoken word amen
[1:29:04] then death and life lies in your power
[1:29:05] of your tongue amen yes Lord amen
[1:29:08] hallelujah praise the Lord now Isaiah 60
[1:29:10] says arise Shine for thy light has come
[1:29:14] amen amen that light is talking about
[1:29:17] the glory of God that light is talking
[1:29:19] about the shakina of God amen amen it's
[1:29:21] not just any light it's the seven sea
[1:29:23] light oh yes amen hallelujah amen amen
[1:29:27] we've had many other words for many
[1:29:28] other ages but at the sounding of the
[1:29:31] seventh Angel's message down comes the
[1:29:33] revelation of the Seven Seals and it
[1:29:35] will be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:29:38] truths that will literally turn our
[1:29:40] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[1:29:42] and by God's grace it has turned our
[1:29:43] hearts back yes amen yes that's right
[1:29:47] amen I'm not talking about it in the
[1:29:48] future tense my heart has already been
[1:29:50] turned back amen
[1:29:54] for behold Darkness covers the earth you
[1:29:57] can't tell me that you look in the earth
[1:29:58] and you can't see Darkness cover the
[1:30:00] Earth nakedness
[1:30:03] filthiness amen man gone
[1:30:07] insane you must have seen this
[1:30:09] documentary they don't can't Define a
[1:30:11] woman documentaries what is a woman
[1:30:14] people are afraid to say what is a
[1:30:17] woman people are afraid to say that
[1:30:20] marriage ought to exist between a man
[1:30:21] man and a woman
[1:30:23] amen that God created Adam and Eve not
[1:30:27] Adam and Steve amen now they've gone Eve
[1:30:31] and
[1:30:33] weave they gone insane what is it
[1:30:37] another Sodom and Gomorrah Luke 17 amen
[1:30:40] as it was so shall it
[1:30:42] be you see the reason why Sodom is in
[1:30:45] the condition it is
[1:30:47] now prophecy must be fulfilled they must
[1:30:50] have come the Angels again
[1:30:53] investigating angels and you know that's
[1:30:55] what the prophet says when those angels
[1:30:57] came down that was a judgment sign yeah
[1:31:00] because he was
[1:31:01] wigged and he was trying to figure out
[1:31:04] why why was he wigged but then he says
[1:31:06] that was the judge of all the Earth yes
[1:31:09] and and he says the Angels themselves
[1:31:12] was his wig so judgment has come down on
[1:31:15] the earth in fact judgment has been
[1:31:17] pronounced on the earth because you
[1:31:18] remember when the seventh angel
[1:31:20] messenger took off The Rock and you
[1:31:22] threw it in the air you go read the
[1:31:24] seventh angel when he's pouring out his
[1:31:26] VI he takes something and he pours it
[1:31:27] out in the air and brother Brandon very
[1:31:30] significantly while he's there he picks
[1:31:32] up a rock and he throws it in the air
[1:31:35] and a wallwind comes down cuts through
[1:31:37] the Rocks pyramid shaped rocks and they
[1:31:42] asked him he says judgment about to
[1:31:44] strike that's right and he says about a
[1:31:46] few days later that Good Friday Alaska
[1:31:49] almost sunk yes amen and he says that
[1:31:51] great earthquake he said it won't stop
[1:31:53] it will continue
[1:31:55] amen so we at the closing scenes of the
[1:31:58] Gentile dispensation amen hallelujah we
[1:32:02] are moving ahead but you know what if I
[1:32:04] told you the Lord was coming in 2024 I
[1:32:07] guarantee you half of the church
[1:32:08] wouldn't even be interested you ask me
[1:32:10] what
[1:32:12] date and you ask me okay what do you
[1:32:15] know the time because you'd want to make
[1:32:17] last minute
[1:32:18] preparations but the Lord told us that
[1:32:21] no man know the time no man know the
[1:32:23] hour because we are to be ready at all
[1:32:26] times amen hallelujah for Darkness
[1:32:31] covers the earth thick darkness is over
[1:32:33] the people but the Lord will arise upon
[1:32:36] you and His glory will appear over you
[1:32:38] am now here brother brandom is talking
[1:32:41] in the message of paradox pre 1965 and
[1:32:44] watch are significant
[1:32:48] now he's a prophet and God speak to him
[1:32:52] through the
[1:32:54] word when I picked this up I was
[1:32:56] rejoicing he says when I opened the
[1:32:59] Bible so the prophet got a new Bible and
[1:33:02] he opened up the Bible and he says in
[1:33:05] the Bible there were two
[1:33:07] ribbons and he opened the first ribbon
[1:33:09] in the Bible was a very strange thing
[1:33:12] where it was was when Solomon dedicated
[1:33:14] the temple of God and the glory of God
[1:33:17] was so great that she kind of Glory in
[1:33:19] the building till the priest couldn't
[1:33:21] even Minister
[1:33:26] amen that's 2 Chronicles chapter 7 now
[1:33:30] that's one marker talking about the Shak
[1:33:33] of Glory coming
[1:33:35] down and the next string was laying
[1:33:38] where Ezra returned and dedicated the
[1:33:45] temple uh you got you got to know the
[1:33:48] hien mystery here on the 14th of March
[1:33:55] I didn't write the the prophet is

[1:38:43] of the
[1:38:44] earth God was God of the heavens and he
[1:38:46] said I'll make man and he shall be he
[1:38:48] shall have dominion and authority over
[1:38:50] the Earth amen not only shall he have
[1:38:52] dominion and authority over the Earth he
[1:38:54] shall operate in Ministry of
[1:38:57] multiplication yes
[1:38:59] yes one of the things opened up to us
[1:39:02] this year was multiplication how it
[1:39:04] operates in the kingdom of God because

[1:39:24] to take bread and multiply
[1:39:28] it amen Jesus took two fish and Five
[1:39:31] Loaves and in a ministry as Adam
[1:39:33] restored back on the earth he multiplied
[1:39:39] it amen amen we told you that 20us 10 in
[1:39:44] the Kingdom of Earth is
[1:39:47] 10 but in the kingdom of God 20 when you
[1:39:51] give 10 you're giving to the poor you're
[1:39:53] giving to the needy you're giving amen
[1:39:55] hallelujah it comes back to you 100 fold
[1:39:59] in the kingdom of God it's
[1:40:00] multiplication 20 - 10 is
[1:40:04] 100 but don't go write that now in your
[1:40:06] math
[1:40:09] test okay so everybody remember this
[1:40:13] because it's a message called who do you
[1:40:15] say this is I asked you who do you say
[1:40:17] this is
[1:40:19] amenallah
[1:40:24] am you are the
[1:40:27] Messiah now this is strong for some
[1:40:30] people but we are in the bright coming
[1:40:32] of
[1:40:34] Christ amen okay let me detail this to
[1:40:37] you very quickly in the first coming
[1:40:39] there had to be a virgin who brought
[1:40:40] forth a physical body of the Lord Jesus
[1:40:42] Christ
[1:40:44] amen for his first coming but his first
[1:40:48] coming with with uh it entail many
[1:40:51] things about his life he had to show
[1:40:53] forth the fruits of
[1:40:54] Messiah but then the ultimate thing was
[1:40:57] that he had to sacrifice his life and
[1:40:59] this is what I was trying to tell you
[1:41:01] amen that Adam lost three things he lost
[1:41:04] eternal life he lost his fellowship with
[1:41:07] God and he lost dominion over the Earth
[1:41:10] before the fall Adam could speak to a
[1:41:12] mountain Adam could speak to a tree and
[1:41:15] it would
[1:41:17] move amen you know the prophet who
[1:41:19] dramatize it uh evil would say oh that
[1:41:21] sun is so hot amen and Adam would speak
[1:41:24] a tree to come and provide shade for
[1:41:27] Eve amen hallelujah he says Shah would
[1:41:31] come amen the lion would come there and
[1:41:33] he stroke the the head of the lion he
[1:41:36] had perfect control over animal life he
[1:41:39] had control over the fish of the sea he
[1:41:42] had control over animal life amen
[1:41:45] hallelujah thank you Lord but he lost
[1:41:48] that so he lost eternal life life he
[1:41:51] lost fellowship with God and he lost
[1:41:53] power that's dominion over the Earth yes
[1:41:56] am so when Jesus Christ comes to pay the
[1:41:59] price of
[1:42:00] redemption if those three things are not
[1:42:04] restored then Jesus work was
[1:42:10] partial you say you're making a strong
[1:42:12] statement
[1:42:13] yes otherwise what's the need for Jesus
[1:42:16] dying on the cross if man is not going
[1:42:18] to be fully restored back to his eeden
[1:42:23] Beauty amen hallelujah so what happens
[1:42:27] amen you know when Jesus died and he
[1:42:29] rose again you find in Revelation
[1:42:31] chapter 5 amen they are looking for a
[1:42:33] man because the title de to man's
[1:42:37] inheritance is laying with God Amen
[1:42:40] there's a book The Prophet says that's a
[1:42:42] title deed to man's
[1:42:44] inheritance it's with God but the book
[1:42:46] don't belong in heaven right amen come
[1:42:49] on now amen Dominion don't belong in
[1:42:51] heaven the Dominion belongs on the earth
[1:42:54] yes
[1:42:55] sir amen so they're looking for a man
[1:42:59] and there's a search made that says they
[1:43:01] look all through Heaven they can't find
[1:43:02] a man they look on Earth they can't find
[1:43:05] a
[1:43:05] man amen the Bible says they even look
[1:43:08] beneath the Earth telling you that they
[1:43:10] are looking for the ones that have gone
[1:43:12] on in this life they're looking in
[1:43:14] Paradise or maybe the sixth Dimension
[1:43:17] they're looking for a man a worthy man
[1:43:21] yeah amen but they can't find
[1:43:24] anyone but wasn't Jesus a
[1:43:26] man why couldn't they find him because
[1:43:29] it must type the Bible when the high
[1:43:31] priest goes in into the
[1:43:33] sanctuary nobody can go in after
[1:43:37] him they have to wait for him to come
[1:43:39] back out amen amen so for seven Church
[1:43:42] ages he had to make intercession in the
[1:43:44] sanctuary in the temple of God but at
[1:43:48] the end of that seventh age he is coming
[1:43:50] back out
[1:43:51] am and that's when John is now weeping
[1:43:55] and he's crying and he's saying because
[1:43:56] there's nobody found
[1:43:58] worthy and then one of the elders say
[1:44:00] John don't weep for the lion of the
[1:44:03] tribe of Judah have prevailed to take
[1:44:07] the book amen John turns Amen in
[1:44:10] anticipation to see who's this lion but
[1:44:12] when John a type of the Bride you know a
[1:44:14] line now is typing because remember the
[1:44:17] the only ones that will see him come as
[1:44:18] a line is the Israel people yeah John is
[1:44:21] the type of the Bride when he turns to
[1:44:23] look he sees the same lamb he says I saw
[1:44:26] it as it had been slain meaning the
[1:44:28] blood was still fresh amen there's still
[1:44:31] blood for you and I amen people may say
[1:44:34] amen hallelujah the blood is of the
[1:44:35] mercy seed I say you're a liar amen the
[1:44:38] blood still amen is available for you
[1:44:40] and
[1:44:40] I thank you Father I want you to know no
[1:44:43] matter how much you fall no matter how
[1:44:45] much you fail get back up immediately
[1:44:47] repent and get back into his presence
[1:44:50] you know what most people do they go
[1:44:51] back into the world and say oh no when
[1:44:53] I'm fine when I'm right with God then
[1:44:55] I'll come back no that's not what to do
[1:44:57] amen you have to come back immediately
[1:44:59] into the house of God repent immediately
[1:45:02] amen amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah
[1:45:07] in a moment of weakness you might make a
[1:45:09] mistake but repent immediately
[1:45:12] amen that's no excuse for you not to say
[1:45:15] okay uh you see maybe I'm not see Satan
[1:45:17] is playing with
[1:45:19] you amen
[1:45:22] hallelujah oh no things are not working
[1:45:24] out for me let me tell you the waiting
[1:45:27] period God has you in a waiting period
[1:45:30] and that waiting period is not to show
[1:45:32] that you're a failure the waiting period
[1:45:34] is to show God in his
[1:45:36] power if you can hold on and believe in
[1:45:38] patience God will come in on the scene
[1:45:41] amen hallelujah so that's your scripture
[1:45:43] who do you say this is God is going to
[1:45:45] show you to be a messiah on the
[1:45:47] earth so what happens
[1:45:51] Jesus now takes the book from the end of
[1:45:52] the Angel sorry the end from God and now
[1:45:57] he takes and you know then from
[1:45:58] Revelation chapter 6 he opened each seal
[1:46:01] he opens each
[1:46:03] seal showing a symbol but then it goes
[1:46:06] forth in the symbol but then there must
[1:46:08] be one on the earth remember I said the
[1:46:11] book don't belong in heaven so
[1:46:13] Revelation 10 shows you how the book is
[1:46:15] coming back to the Earth
[1:46:18] Amen in fact Jesus showed them
[1:46:21] beforehand what Authority lay in man
[1:46:24] they had forgotten what man was about
[1:46:27] when he spoke to the winds when he spoke
[1:46:29] to the Seas when he spoke to amen he
[1:46:32] spoke to the blind man he spoke to the
[1:46:35] man and they all got healed he
[1:46:36] spoke to the
[1:46:39] tree and the tree withered away then
[1:46:42] they said what manner of man is this
[1:46:45] Glory we don't know about such a man let
[1:46:48] me tell you something you can go to
[1:46:49] Every denominator school every Bible
[1:46:52] school every Seminary Nobody Knows the
[1:46:56] condition that Adam was in go look it up
[1:47:00] go see if they will tell you that Adam
[1:47:01] was a God man that Adam could
[1:47:05] speak have you ever read their writings
[1:47:07] like
[1:47:11] that only in the message of the hour
[1:47:13] you'll find that where the Prophet tells
[1:47:15] us that we bypass our theophany they
[1:47:17] don't know anything about
[1:47:19] theophanies
[1:47:23] so here Revelation 10 the mighty Angel
[1:47:25] comes back down and he's got an open
[1:47:27] book in his hand titled deed to man's
[1:47:30] inheritance you know what a title deed
[1:47:32] is it's coming back to you to tell you
[1:47:34] that you are the rightful owner of the
[1:47:39] earth and the mighty angel now we know
[1:47:41] that's 1963 he's coming to connect with
[1:47:44] a prophet messenger Amen to tell him I'm
[1:47:47] going to reveal the mysteries of God
[1:47:51] and these mysteries of God is going to
[1:47:53] give you such a faith that it's going to
[1:47:55] put you back in your
[1:47:56] condition come on yes sir but you see
[1:48:00] only a few are going to catch
[1:48:02] it and Mark 11:23 he's telling you how
[1:48:06] man must believe his own word yes amen
[1:48:09] the reason why things are not happening
[1:48:10] in your life you don't believe your own
[1:48:12] word you don't believe that you possess
[1:48:14] the power in your own mouth
[1:48:16] on
[1:48:19] Amen you when Joshua was speaking to the
[1:48:21] son you think he he went to go and pray
[1:48:24] somewhere no did Joshua go to pray or
[1:48:27] did he say
[1:48:31] Amen in a moment of need he spoke to the
[1:48:33] son yes yes come on he said Son stand
[1:48:38] still yes
[1:48:40] sir the title de comes back to a man on
[1:48:42] the Earth but if you find from verse 8
[1:48:45] to 11 it's speaking to John John is the
[1:48:48] type of the Bride he's talking to you
[1:48:49] and telling you you can have the same
[1:48:51] Authority that Jesus had you can share
[1:48:54] in his glory if you take the book and
[1:48:57] eat the book you become the
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:01] book and then you can speak again you
[1:49:03] see your prophecy is different from
[1:49:05] every other Prophecy in the Bible
[1:49:07] because your prophecy is now back in the
[1:49:10] image of God back in the image and
[1:49:12] likeness of God amen amen hallelujah
[1:49:15] amen so I'm telling you Jesus Christ
[1:49:17] when he died and he rose again he paid
[1:49:19] the price for your Redemption not only
[1:49:21] for you to be saved amen but for you to
[1:49:24] come back to your original
[1:49:26] condition and yet the part people don't
[1:49:33] like the way for you to come back to
[1:49:35] just into your sunship Authority there's
[1:49:38] only one way
[1:49:39] provided amen but it's a way people
[1:49:44] hate because it's called the Holy
[1:49:48] Ghost amen ah here you go
[1:49:51] again I thought I'll just get super
[1:49:53] duper power without the Holy Ghost you
[1:49:56] know this Holy Ghost he so
[1:49:59] demanding I can't do nothing I can't
[1:50:02] think my own
[1:50:03] thoughts I can't do my own
[1:50:07] things I can't look to the left I can't
[1:50:09] look to the right it convicts me of
[1:50:14] everything amen right makes me love
[1:50:19] everyone
[1:50:20] yes it makes me forgive everyone yes you
[1:50:22] know we're talking about multiplication
[1:50:25] you know when Jesus is teaching about
[1:50:26] forgiveness he's telling you to forgive
[1:50:28] in multiplication as well 70 * 7 that's
[1:50:32] how the kingdom operates everything in
[1:50:38] multiplication
[1:50:39] amen now yes title did coming back to a
[1:50:42] man and let me show you William brandom

[1:50:47] man who could speak to the beast in the
[1:50:48] field A Raging Bull a man who could

[1:50:53] to the fish of the
[1:50:55] sea he could speak to a cyst he could
[1:50:58] speak to a storm amen what manner of man
[1:51:01] is this a God man a man back in the
[1:51:04] image and likeness of God Amen but that
[1:51:07] doesn't Elevate him to tell me hey that
[1:51:09] he is something that I must idolize no
[1:51:11] that's showing me that the first wave
[1:51:13] sheep has been waved amen and the first
[1:51:15] one has come to maturity and I can come
[1:51:17] to
[1:51:18] maturity yes the first wave sheath is

[1:56:21] that's got any knowledge of the word
[1:56:23] well if we can't have faith enough for
[1:56:25] Divine Healing how are we going to have
[1:56:27] a rapturing
[1:56:31] faith oh I believe there's a great
[1:56:33] calling coming forth I believe as David
[1:56:35] said he laid there and waited until you
[1:56:38] see he listened and
[1:56:41] waited after a while he heard a rushing
[1:56:43] wind go through the malberry leaves
[1:56:45] going around he know God was going
[1:56:47] before him oh brother I'm listening for
[1:56:49] the rushing of the leaves the noise in
[1:56:51] the malberry bushes God's going before
[1:56:54] the battle then let's rise and put on
[1:56:56] the full armor of God pull the sword go
[1:56:59] after it The Battle Belongs to us when
[1:57:01] we see the hand of God moving on through
[1:57:04] signs and wonders let's start following
[1:57:07] on that's why I say we can't go
[1:57:13] backwards you see why I say that song
[1:57:16] even we've seen the supernatural scene
[1:57:19] is past tense that's why I told him drop
[1:57:21] the
[1:57:22] end we see the supernatural in our
[1:57:27] day
[1:57:31] amen 1 John 3:2 says beloved now are we
[1:57:36] the sons of God and it do not appear
[1:57:39] what we shall be but we know when we
[1:57:41] shall see when he shall appear we shall
[1:57:43] be like him for we shall see as he is
[1:57:48] how is Jesus now in a glorified body so
[1:57:51] when we see him we shall be in a
[1:57:53] glorified body so what is it telling now
[1:57:57] are we the sons of God so being a child
[1:57:59] of God is not a future
[1:58:03] event we are children from the point we
[1:58:06] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ born
[1:58:09] again baptized into his kingdom filled
[1:58:11] with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:58:14] hallelujah so we find here that his
[1:58:16] glory was so strong that the Angels min
[1:58:19] mining to him cover their faces you know
[1:58:22] the seraphim they cover their faces they
[1:58:24] got six wings two they cover their face
[1:58:27] to they cover their feet amen hallelujah
[1:58:31] when Isaiah remember Isaiah had a
[1:58:33] revelation of God's
[1:58:35] glory so the glory of the Lord that's
[1:58:38] why I say people don't want this word
[1:58:40] because the glory of the Lord will
[1:58:42] uncover all your weaknesses yes yeah
[1:58:45] that's
[1:58:46] right amen yes sir because when saw the
[1:58:50] glory of God he says oh woe is me I'm a
[1:58:52] man of unclean lips he started to
[1:58:54] remember all the things he was
[1:58:56] saying
[1:58:59] yes I dwell in the land of unclean
[1:59:01] people not only uncover your weakness
[1:59:04] uncover the land's weaknesses that's the
[1:59:07] glory of

[1:59:11] glory within you if you're filled with

[2:00:06] man put it up some one some people don't
[2:00:09] know the scripture they don't read their
[2:00:11] Bible
[2:00:14] amen nothing shall tempt me you think so
[2:00:20] you know the woman who was
[2:00:22] delivered from a life of sin the prophet
[2:00:25] says she walk past the dance all one day
[2:00:28] amen and she stayed to listen to that
[2:00:32] song
[2:00:35] he and she heard she was walking past
[2:00:37] she can hear Whitney Houston I Will

[2:00:43] herself in the arms of her
[2:00:45] lover and says before she know it she
[2:00:47] was back in the ball

[2:00:56] away from it don't see how close to the
[2:00:58] ledge you can get see how far away you

[2:01:29] Bible says why don't you let them judge
[2:01:31] the matter why are you going to the
[2:01:33] courts let them judge the matter
[2:01:36] amen walks not in the counsel of the
[2:01:39] ungodly nor stand it in the way of

[2:03:29] Amen in fact there's no situation that
[2:03:32] can stand before
[2:03:36] you you can get out of every situation
[2:03:40] through the
[2:03:42] word the word is the
[2:03:47] ultimate and tonight we're going to

[2:04:06] 2024 he's got to find a new
[2:04:11] body but don't be Happ it about it
[2:04:14] otherwise he's coming with seven of his
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:17] friends if we break addiction it's got
[2:04:20] to
[2:04:21] leave amen hallelujah but you got to
[2:04:24] fill it with the Holy
[2:04:27] Ghost if we bind the strong
[2:04:33] man making war in the
[2:04:37] heavenlies tearing down
[2:04:40] principalities that exalts itself
[2:04:43] against the knowledge of
[2:04:47] God
[2:04:51] God's glory will reveal your true state
[2:04:53] to you we're talking about Isaiah there
[2:04:56] in the presence wrong motives and all
[2:04:58] manner of evil is exposed
[2:05:02] am you see as I in the temple saw the
[2:05:05] glory of God and it exposed his weakness
[2:05:07] that's why through the preaching of the
[2:05:09] word it comes to expose your weakness
[2:05:11] amen why because his strength is made
[2:05:13] perfect in our weakness when when the
[2:05:15] spirit of the Lord is convicting you
[2:05:17] it's not to pull you down is to pick you
[2:05:19] up yes
[2:05:20] sir that's God's love to you not to tear
[2:05:23] you down not don't never ever feel
[2:05:25] insulted if the word is coming in a way
[2:05:27] and Discerning your heart say that's the
[2:05:29] grace of God to me
[2:05:31] amen because through the foolishness of
[2:05:33] preaching the
[2:05:35] word that's what God has chosen for the
[2:05:37] Salvation of
[2:05:39] man now when the Bible says you are the
[2:05:41] Temple of the Holy Spirit it is saying
[2:05:43] that God's spirit lives in you it is
[2:05:46] saying much more than that God is saying
[2:05:48] that you you are the holy place that
[2:05:50] means that you need to take good care of
[2:05:52] yourself both spiritually physically and
[2:05:55] mentally amen amen you see when his
[2:05:59] glory is revealed to us and we stand in
[2:06:01] the midst of his glory we must recognize
[2:06:03] his
[2:06:05] glory I'm saying this again because the
[2:06:08] glory has already been Fallen amen when
[2:06:10] we stand in the midst of his glory we
[2:06:12] must recognize his glory yes sir amen
[2:06:16] and we must respond to the Glory by
[2:06:18] bearing fruit the seed within us must
[2:06:20] bear fruit or the life in our branches
[2:06:22] must show forth life amen if we don't
[2:06:25] respond to the glory of his presence
[2:06:27] like Aaron's Rod did when it laid in the
[2:06:29] Ark of the Covenant and the glory of the
[2:06:31] Lord was upon it that a dry dead Rod
[2:06:34] started to bear for
[2:06:39] armonds in the presence of the sh Glory
[2:06:42] there now I got to slow this down they
[2:06:45] had a rod somebody gave me flowers from
[2:06:48] the Holy Land
[2:06:51] who is this Josephine is your
[2:06:55] flowers amen praise the Lord must be
[2:06:57] here for a
[2:06:58] reason this look like fig trees
[2:07:01] too is a
[2:07:05] fig okay could be for a reason right cuz
[2:07:08] I'm talking about a fig tree
[2:07:11] now what they did was aon's Rod that was
[2:07:15] used you know they cast it down it
[2:07:17] turned into a serpent yes that was now
[2:07:20] almond Branch they cut it from an almond
[2:07:25] tree so they took this rod and they
[2:07:29] placed it in the Ark of the
[2:07:31] Covenant now this Rod was dead for many
[2:07:34] years dried up but when they placed it
[2:07:38] in the Ark of the Covenant in the
[2:07:40] presence of the sh of
[2:07:41] Glory that Rod started to Bear forth
[2:07:45] leaves and he started to Bud come on if
[2:07:49] you know these things say Amen am he
[2:07:51] started to Bud and bear
[2:07:53] armonds that's what the shanic glory of
[2:07:56] God will
[2:07:57] do now why I'm telling you that is to
[2:07:59] tell you this the sh same kind of Glory
[2:08:03] was in Jesus Christ amen and when he
[2:08:06] appeared before this fig
[2:08:09] tree the Fig Tree didn't respond like
[2:08:12] that Alon Branch oh yes yes it refused
[2:08:16] to recognize the sh of glor come
[2:08:19] on Amen yes come on that is why Jesus
[2:08:24] cursed
[2:08:25] it when you can't recognize his
[2:08:29] presence then you are cursed with a
[2:08:32] curse then we end up like the Fig Tree
[2:08:35] cursed wither to the root amen because
[2:08:39] here a tree that had life it failed to
[2:08:41] recognize the presence of God Almighty
[2:08:44] and refus to bring forth its fruit so
[2:08:46] the king of glory cursed the Fig Tree
[2:08:48] and and said no man eat of thee don't be
[2:08:50] like the Fig
[2:08:53] Tree and not recognize the presence
[2:08:56] recognize his glory and live and dwell
[2:08:58] in the
[2:09:00] glory the prophet says here and when you
[2:09:03] go to talking about being born again now
[2:09:06] this is what I'm talking about and this
[2:09:07] I found this evening when I was going
[2:09:09] home I was telling my wife I said you
[2:09:11] don't know what happened this morning
[2:09:13] service when I mentioned the Holy Ghost
[2:09:15] there was a wave come back
[2:09:21] unbelief rejection of that people can't
[2:09:25] surrender to the Holy Spirit and when I
[2:09:27] found this I said I must read it to the
[2:09:30] church in preparing now when I went home
[2:09:32] he says when you go to talking about
[2:09:34] being born again receiving the baptism
[2:09:36] of the Holy Ghost nine times out of 10
[2:09:39] them spirits will show their colors what
[2:09:42] they
[2:09:44] areen the rejection of the Holy Ghost
[2:09:52] yeah and that's what the matter with the
[2:09:54] church the hope of glory the baptism of
[2:09:57] the Holy Ghost has come into the
[2:10:00] people's heart and they don't recognize
[2:10:02] what it
[2:10:05] is my brother carries a sh of glory amen
[2:10:09] my brother carries a sh of Glory my
[2:10:11] sister carries the sh of
[2:10:15] Glory why you think that Jesus said in
[2:10:18] that day you say one thing against
[2:10:21] them it's better than a millstone come
[2:10:23] on put around your neck and thrown into
[2:10:27] the sea
[2:10:28] right you're carrying the presence of
[2:10:31] God
[2:10:34] Amen they think it's a little church
[2:10:37] joining or something like
[2:10:38] that you see we think hey maybe we're in
[2:10:41] the message of the hour because of the
[2:10:42] Holiness standards no because of the
[2:10:45] dressing standards no because their
[2:10:47] woman don't wear makeup up no because
[2:10:49] they don't wear earrings no we're here
[2:10:51] because we are carrying the presence of
[2:10:53] God come on Amen the presence of God
[2:10:56] doesn't will not will make you conform
[2:10:58] to the Bible to the word of God and
[2:11:00] won't make you deviate from the word of
[2:11:02] God if you get the baptism of the Holy
[2:11:04] Ghost your battle is won
[2:11:06] amen amen amen amen he says but that is
[2:11:12] the god the Creator living in you and
[2:11:15] giving you some of the power
[2:11:21] you know brother I always wonder why I
[2:11:25] look at these men Ministry and I see hey
[2:11:27] the power of God is moving in there you
[2:11:29] don't see the price they
[2:11:34] pay yes you don't see the hours they
[2:11:36] spend in prayer yes you don't see the
[2:11:38] hours they spend in the word all you see
[2:11:41] is them come forth in the pulpit and
[2:11:43] maybe preach and then you're so critical
[2:11:45] of
[2:11:46] that you don't see the labor that goes
[2:11:49] on connecting with the anointing
[2:11:52] connecting with the angel of
[2:11:55] God what is he saying but this is for
[2:11:58] you
[2:12:00] now God living in you giving you all the
[2:12:06] powers he said but I've never seen any
[2:12:08] miraculous in my life you've not
[2:12:11] spoken that's right you've not believed
[2:12:13] your own word
[2:12:17] yes say well I'm going you know any any
[2:12:20] military army must test the
[2:12:22] Weaponry your weapon is your
[2:12:27] words next time you have a need
[2:12:31] speak and believe your word amen your
[2:12:34] word is based on the word of God you
[2:12:36] believe the word you quote the word you
[2:12:37] say Lord according to Mark 11:23 you
[2:12:40] said if I speak to this mountain and I
[2:12:42] tell it to be removed and I don't doubt
[2:12:44] in my heart I'm refusing to doubt I
[2:12:46] believe your word you said I shall have
[2:12:48] what I have said
[2:12:50] amen I'm laying it there and you watch
[2:12:53] if that word will not come to pass yes
[2:12:57] Lord thank you
[2:12:59] Lord but that is the god the Creator
[2:13:01] living in you giving you all the powers
[2:13:03] and you're in possession of anything
[2:13:05] that he
[2:13:11] had why you can't leave a mythical Jesus
[2:13:15] I love to read about his power and the
[2:13:17] glory that he had but he wants to share
[2:13:20] his glory with no man we know that Bible
[2:13:23] says that he will share but that is
[2:13:26] talking about another aspect
[2:13:28] now that is talking about man taking
[2:13:31] glory for
[2:13:32] himself he won't share that Glory of any
[2:13:35] man but his wife he will withhold

[2:15:52] glorification oh
[2:15:55] yes but we are moving another step
[2:15:57] towards glorification because the same
[2:16:00] spirit that did it for the groom must do
[2:16:02] it for the bridegroom the Bible says
[2:16:04] that the same spirit that raised Jesus
[2:16:06] from the dead dwells in you the same
[2:16:08] spirit that quickened his mortal body
[2:16:10] will also Quicken your body The Same
[2:16:12] Spirit that Rose Jesus from the dead
[2:16:14] into a glorified state is the same
[2:16:16] spirit that dwells in
[2:16:18] you and his final work must be to bring
[2:16:21] you to glorification you see why the
[2:16:23] Holy Ghost is important without the Holy
[2:16:26] Ghost you are not coming into
[2:16:30] glorification the same spirit that did
[2:16:32] it for the groom must do it for the
[2:16:33] bridegroom if the last Adam was changed
[2:16:35] from a mortal body to a glorified body
[2:16:38] so will the last Eve be changed
[2:16:42] amen my last scripture will be Psalm
[2:16:45] 24 Psalm 24 says the the Earth is the
[2:16:48] Lords and the fullness thereof the world
[2:16:51] and all who dwell therein for he founded
