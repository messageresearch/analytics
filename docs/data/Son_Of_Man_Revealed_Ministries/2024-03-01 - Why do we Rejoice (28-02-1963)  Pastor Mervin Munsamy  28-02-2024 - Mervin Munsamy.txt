========================================

amen that was powerful amen let's give the Lord a good an of Praise amen hallelujah amen perfectly through the scripture amen we won't take much time Pastor mvin can come amen and fire away amen I believe he's got a AK-47 come Pastor mvin let's take my hand as he [Applause] comes thank you Lord there's nothing else to be said amen prise the Lord amen that was wonderful and seriously uh most of the quotations you've already taken but nevertheless let's stand amen praise the lord it's also going to read Revelation 10:7 but since we've we've gone through that scripture let's just read um 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 amen praise the Lord and the Bible says in verse 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout hallelujah with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord let's bow for prayer thank you Lord father we thank you for this wonderful anointing that we find in this in this place tonight Lord in your house we thank you for what has been said thus far Lord we pray oh God that you would continue to move in the hearts of the people Lord we pray that even as we would further just touch on a few thoughts tonight every Minister having his own uh way and method of bringing the message across we ask father that you will be our portion and strength as we look to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and all God's people said amen you may take your seat so now that we've been given a most wonderful presentation yes of what the 28th of February 1963 was what does that mean for you and I amen amen what's the purpose of Us coming here together was it just another day for have church but so why do we Rejoice what are we making all this noise about but let me start off by saying something like this we are not human beings having a spiritual experience but we Are Spiritual Beings having a human experience amen because we come we we come from God and we're going back to God amenu and do you realize tonight that without us God is incomplete amen Hallelujah that is why there had to be a Redemption story once we were broken our fellowship was broken with God in the Garden of Eden amen there had to be a restoration and sometimes we think that the the calvary the death on the cross was it yes but Redemption didn't stop death church amen hallelujah 38th of February 1963 is also our symbol of redemption hallelujah hallelujah we love him tonight separated us so what we can we can say tonight if we want to we our precious Pastor Denzel say that this was a supernatural experience but guess what we are supernatural beings Hallelujah we are just tabernacling in this natural fish waiting for us to have a body change hallelujah amen so we thank the Lord for the way it was presented amen but you see our inherent quality forget about this flesh that you in we're going to get rid of it one day that is not the real you Hallelujah but the real you has a DNA that desires Supernatural things Supernatural things so our DNA has been designed to digest Supernatural things that is why when we hear the things we are hearing it excites us amen because our our theophany that's on that side is getting excited because one time we're going to let go of this Natural Body amen and take on another one hallelujah hallelujah we had brother brandham on the on the earth and we had had an Ang seven angels that were there at a representation of of both yes so we thank the Lord tonight for the things that we have heard but we also realize there'll be much critics when it comes to these things as we hear our pastors say because you can't teach Supernatural things to Pentecostal Bab amen hallelujah so you must get this message has to go to the allall of critics amen but we are those ones chosen at the end time to show forth this message we don't prove it with our mouths we prove it with our lives hallelujah amen thank you Lord Glory thank you Lord so this is a great time because it's the greatest age of deception Hallelujah and we have the the opportunity and we can if we're not wise and prudent we're going to find ourselves getting into a place if we're not wise and alert we're going to find ourselves allowing the coldness that comes with all the negativity to make our faith muscles defeat amen but the word tonight has been yet to grow our faith mus to get us into a rapturing condition because we realize that even as God is gathering a bride this Antichrist spirit is also Gathering a BRI Hallelujah yes and we find even on on a slide that we've got just some simple thoughts tonight about the definition of a cloud why do we Rejoice yes Am A Cloud by the definition is a mass of water drops right or or ice crystals suspended in an atmosphere but we've already heard tonight that this was not that amen it was no water drops because if that was the case in that seven days we would probably had rain amen but we had clear skies and these angelic wings made this cloud in the sky amen hallelujah amen but what we find the biblical definition of the word cloud is covering and we heard tonight that it's a covenant amen and it's a covering for us and we realized that that constellation of seven angels is the work of the Holy Ghost through seven Church ages amen and this is not the first time as we heard that these things have happened but God has been using the supernatural right through Biblical scriptures right now and God doesn't change his pth hallelujah hallelujah amen so this is something that should not excite us to a point where we in awe because we should know this is how God operates amen amen for others miracles are H H something out of the ordinary but for God it's his lifestyle praise the Lorden and that's the way we ought to get amen is get up into that Supernatural this is this Cloud was a covering amen and we heard uh you know in the scripture when came to Mary it was the Holy Ghost that overshadowed her and the Holy Ghost is shadowing the end time bride up until the Rapture come takes place so if you're worried about what's happening in the Earth today you worried about the economy you're worried about the violence worried about what's going to happen with the political system you don't need to worry about all of those things amen they have been ordained to do those things Hallelujah but God has made available a covering to take you into the hallelujah hallelujah amen so you find that as we heard as we would have heard previously and we heard tonight that there's a lot of controversy around this Cloud yes amen and there's much more material on the critics than they is about the original things but we don't mind because we enjoy being in the minority because we typing scripture amen so we heard about Noah and and uh uh how Noah would have looked in those days building an ark being ridiculed because it was not something that a man with wisdom would do there's no water why on Earth would you want to build an ark but you see for the people of that day it was foolishness but for Noah he was following the word for his day praise the Lord so following this message at a time especially for our young people tonight yes may seem foolish but nonetheless it's the word of the lord it's the very thing that's going to take us into the Lurch if go if in Noah's day the ark is God saved no one's family amen the message of the hour is that up to us that's going to take us into the Rapture hallelujah amen so we saw that uh so there's a lot of critics out there yes but we need to have the faith today today for what to tell them you too late amen hallelujah because there will be people that will continuously as the the the Rapture reaches its climax will continue to think of everything they can to try and discourage you in your walk with God yes Hallelujah and maybe you might not be able to come across like pre like the preachers to come and defend the word you don't need to do that God takes care of those battles as long as you whatever little word you have in you you are able to live that out for the glory of God hallelujah so today we are excited we are rejoicing because this Cloud that came on the 28th of February 1963 is a covering to the Bride of Jesus hallelujah amen now we also Rejoice because this cloud is a sign of purification how do we know that because the month of February right the the months of the year are are named after the Roman gods and you find that the month of February comes from a Roman Festival of purification called februar right so I don't think it's strange that God chose the month of February to show for discovering Amen on the 28th of February 1963 because God was bringing pration to his bride at the end time why he's washing us By the Waters of the world Hallelujah wonderful washing Us by the water of his word amen so we are we are just so excited because tonight this message is just not not we Rejoice because we are being washed By the Waters of the word amen aren't you glad tonight to be in this message Hallelujah you mustn't just sing this me this the song I'm only in this message by Grace but your life must live there out because really what is the message the message is the life of Jesus Christ being displayed from the life of a Believer that's what it is we can hear all these wonderful things but when we go out here if we cannot reflect Jesus Christ then this Cloud can either be a bullboard for Christ or it can be a amen that's really what it is we can rejoice in the good things about the things that we hear and how everything types up and this and and all of those things those are lovely things which we love to hear but brother B says I I don't care whether my shoes yes matches my shirt or my tie matches my touses but I want my experience to match the world tonight this is why we're here we rejoicing because we want the word to change Us in such a way that we become that word and in that way God is glorified hallelujah amen we Rejoice tonight because In This Cloud we see Redemption amen yes we see Redemption and when Pastor Denzel was going down the RO I said don't you don't you but in a simple way uh tonight um in the in the in the message the absolute which he he spoke about preached on the 4th of March 1963 brother bam tells us about Ted kerman's sister Sylvia uh Ares who sent a telegram to uh sent a telegram to the prophet regarding a son Pastor Danel spoke about that who was what age at the time 28 years old amen he was 28 years old at the time and um so what had happened was they on um him and his the girl that he was with they were on trial for the murder of an estate agent named Fred tonis okay so at the time if you committed those kind of capital crimes it meant the death penalty yes so here is a mother who's praying and trusting the Lord and wants the prophet to come because he knows that there is something Supernatural about the message that he brings amen amen do you believe that there's something Supernatural about this message are you looking for the word when you get into those dark situations are you looking for this message to come amen when when when you're going through a rough time you may listen to all kinds of things but when you're going through a a rough time you want to listen to the voice of the seventh angel why because you know in your the real you that they this word is true Hallelujah so you find that there's a Praying Mother that now gets the calls the prophet on the scene and this is not the first time this has happened in the Bible or in the ministry of the prophet and then you find that they have a prayer meeting calling on the name of the Lord for the Lord to come and make a way now remember according to the law of that day yes the crime was that they would go through uh the death sentence yes right very similar to like the woman who was caught in adultery yeah there was already a dead sentence according to the law but Jesus on the scene changed the situation and when these Saints of that day began to pray and call on the name of the Lord what we soon find that 4 hours 4 hours before they was to put this man to death by the electric chair the court overturned the decision amen hallelujah hallelujah amen now you'll notice is 4 hours and four speaks of Deliverance Hallelujah so god is perfect in everything that he does and guess what this young man got as as an alternative to the electric chair death he got a life sentence you got that tonight you got a life sentence and amen with the what happened on the 28th of February 1963 we got us also got a sentence we got an eternal life sentence amenu because the word being revealed in our day the Mysteries that has been hid before the foundations of the Earth being revealed in this hour has brought what taken us from death into life so that is why we Rejoice because we know this natural life is only a perversion but we realize that we are from eternity and we are Desiring to go back to Eternity hallelujah amen so we find that this was Redemption outplaying itself praise the Lord amen thank you Lord the cloud why we Rejoice tonight is that this cloud is proof that this message is true Hallelujah yes absolutely it is true amen and we heard it beautifully from the previous speaker that this message is true it is perfectly aligned to the scriptures but wait it the the the the challenge lie it now needs to be aligned with our lives because the mystery of the Seven Seals can be has been fully completed and opened by the prophet it's finished the scripture says and maybe in your church that Ministry could be finished but is it finished in you that's what what it really matters because we can be rejoicing and saying Amen to the word but if that word has not changed us and prepared us for a body change then I'm sorry we cannot Rejoice tonight it's not true rejoicing the woman um in John 4:24 we hear about the woman at the well and the scripture there tells us that God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and truth is speaking about our Doctrine worshiping the Lord and only in true worship can only come by the right drct now you know church I always thought that you know as I was GR growing up as a young man I was involved in the ministry from a very young age but in the uh denominational uh Church system and you know being involved in a lot of house meetings and doing a lot of Outreach and Hospital visitations and you you feel very religious when you're doing those kind of things and those things do have a place in the word because they come from the word but I always thought that that was the father's business I was going about my father's business each day doing all these kind of things but it took a prophet at the end time to come and say that is not the father's business but if you're about your father's business it's there to seek out and search out those Mysteries that were hidden before the foundations of the earth and that is the father's business amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen so this woman at the well when she received uh um her message when she came to the realization of not only who he was but who she is it didn't matter the natural circumstances which you were so aware of previously made no uh effect on her thereafter the same people that she was trying to hide from she ran towards them amen hallelujah she moved from hiding to now a running running billboard for for the Lord Jesus Christ amen why she realized that within her there was something much greater have you come to that place tonight to realize no matter what challenges that you might be facing in this time no matter whatever family problems you might be having or issues at work and all of those things because that's what is boil to we cannot divorce God from any area of Our Lives all these things will be good to hear but if it doesn't do a change in you then God's word is not alive you are the ones that prove that Jesus is Alive in our day amen praise the Lord amen because we understand that we are living in this hour and you know put it to you this way every single saint of God and man of God Through the Bible prophets and major and minor prophets would have been so delighted to see the Fulfillment of our day amen I can just imagining imagining them having this discussions by themselves to try and understand what's happening on the earth amen but I believe that God knew that in the seventh leian age yes there will be a people amen that will be built in such a way that they will be able to digest the full word amen and those people is actually you and I to amen and I believe and I'm sure you'll agree with me as much as we respect every major and minor Prophet that has been before but I believe from my experience with this message message that William Mar and brandham is the greatest prophet of all time amen hallelujah but why should we Rejoice with that we don't stop it just there because if he was the greatest prophet of all time then it makes us the greatest bride of all time we can Rejoice Hallelujah because when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away the perfect word for this end time has come how to do what to prepare a bride for Rapture amen there won't be an eighth age as our our precious um uh U uh pastor had made mentioned many are looking for an eighth messenger but we know that that's just a perversion in the Feast of the trumpets there's a quotation in the prayer brother Bram says that he speaks about um an eighth messenger and one can actually if you don't not careful you could think that and believe that there's an eight messenger but then further he goes on to say that messenger messenger the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the messenger being the Holy Ghost has been always down through seven Church ages amen amen there is no seventh Church age uh an eighth Church age the seventh age is the last and the eighth is eternity amen that's why we thank the Lord for his great love and Tender Mercies towards us so this me message we Rejoice tonight because this cloud is proof that this message is true amen we just do do um I know time has gone we'll just do uh the quote that's thereafter okay let's just go I think I I added a definition of Supernatural there let's just go there quickly just to help you understand that the definition of Supernatural means that something is beyond and above the natural right and this is where God operates amen okay A Realm where Heaven and Earth intermingle you see you were not born to fot into this world but you were born to stand out that is your ministry upon the Earth while while we wait for the Lord to come to stand out to be different to be that peculiar people to be that royal priesthood that is the word working in you am amen so we find where Heaven and Earth intermingle that's the type of relationship and that's the type your of life that you should live each day where Heaven and Earth intermingle but really it refers to something unexplainable yes so if you are intermingling or having fellowship with people who are trying to explain God you rather cut your fellowship off because there are many things that you cannot explain about God Amen and is blessed are those that have not seen yet they believe amen so God is Supernatural and if God is Supernatural and brother Bram says that if you take a teaspoon of ocean water even though you have such a small quantity whatever is in the teaspoon is the same properties that in that ocean amen so today if you have that spirit of God in you amen you as I said God is incomplete without you that makes you Church you are Supernatural the Lord amen let's go to the first quote there we might won't go through every one of them but in the message Shalom the prophet says and there stood those seven angels just as natural as you see me standing here yes so this was not just as natural as you see me standing here so this was not some figment of somebody's imagination amen if you believe the prophet then you have to believe what the prophet says is true you have to come to that place where William Man brandham by yourself is in your heart you know that he's God's Propet for this day otherwise everything else will be a glare and you'll find that today yeah we reading tonight he says and just as natural something tangible something that you can feel it's real right as you can see standing here and told me to return to my home that the Mysteries that the reformers down Through the Ages had failed to pick up amen so you're living in a age though naturally there may be so much of Destruction but we living in an age where there's no failures Hallelujah there's no failures because you got a perfect word for a perfect church for a for a Perfect Bride Hallelujah right the Mysteries that the reformers Through the Ages had failed to pick up the mysteries of the Bible which Seven Seals held would be revealed and then he says I challenge anybody get those Seven Seals and look over them right and find a fault with them find a fault Hallelujah you're going to have a rough time with that amen because everyone would try to disprove uh the Lord they either became a believer of this message amen or they Fallen by the wayside one of the too amen because this is this message is rapturing Faith amen so you find he says because it's given by inspiration by God Amen so this message is not from Kentucky amen it's not from America amen it's not from your church but it's from the Throne of God Amen Hallelujah get up to to Rapture a a bride for for the Lord amen you must remember he also says uh in many of the of the messages that the opening of The Seven Seals brought open to to to book many Mysteries one of their marriage and divorce am and what you find that at the beginning there was a marriage yes and there was also a divorce and it must type up at the end where there's a marriage and there's a divorce as well amen and many of us maybe not understand this but the marriage takes place on Earth and we all when we Rejoice about a a natural wedding we can't lie we always think about the meal that's going to come so you should Also spiritually be wondering about the meal to come because it's a mar supper that we are fixing to go and our transport to get there is this message of the hour hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord right so because it was given by inspiration from God prior to that I preached on the seven Church ages and then draw them out on the Blackboard in my Tabernacle what happened there was the Holy Ghost Amen in that meeting came and drew the entire church ages amen the the golden candlesticks at the back of the church what does that mean the message that you are have access to is a supernatural message why it's been inspired by God to take a bride from the death of sin to eternal life Lord amen am so if you can see these things you're looking for for for proof there is proof that you can get recorded proof of how this message is true there's many quotes I'll just do the last one and then we'll hand over to the to the next sorry this number two okay and so in the message it is the rising of the Sun in paragraph 12 the prophet says and so he he spoke to me and said the Seven Seals will be opened the seven Mysteries Sevenfold Mysteries of the Bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed amen right and yet and we yet humble little group compared with all the world yes we've always been taking pride in being the minority amen and we yet a humble group compared with the world we've enjoyed these blessings hearing those Mysteries marriage and divorce serpent seed and all different questions has completely revealed to us not by men but by God this is a message not by man so those people that are trying to prove that we're worshiping a man sorry you're too late this is a message by God himself amen God himself that's open those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in Christ at the beginning and how it will be revealed in the last days let's give the Lord hand of Praise hallelujah amen
