tonight amen looking for what he would speak to us another word amen to build us up in our faith amen so amen so i pray that you are blessed in the presence of the lord amen hallelujah amen so for those of you who left your vocal box at home amen bring it back via transportation teleportation and bring your best amen to church amen hallelujah amen let's turn to titus chapter 2 and verse 11. we'll speak a little thought called looking for that blessed hope amen looking for that blessed hope hallelujah ii titus chapter 2 and verse 11 reads for the grace of god that bring it salvation and appeared to all men amen what brought salvation the grace of god that brought salvation and appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world amen verse 13 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ amen may god add blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen hallelujah amen we thank god for the blessings that he has given to us we failed unworthy people amen but the grace of god had appeared unto all men amen and he had redeemed us all together by his grace amen by election of god he has called us into this blessed hope that the apostle paul is talking about here into this blessed hope that we have tonight in christ jesus amen we seated here today we are anticipating the secret catching away of the bride of jesus christ amen and we know that this catching away the rapture to be caught up is a revelation amen we know that faith is a revelation so the rapture is something that has been revealed to the bride of jesus christ alone amen like abraham one man in his generation and like that scripture opens up in verse 11 the grace of god appeared to abraham in fact the grace of god appeared to all men in that day just like i would appear to us but the grace of god appeared to abraham one man in his generation and when the grace of god appeared to abraham he could say like isaiah 60 verse 1 says arise shine for thy light is come amen abraham arose soon as coming amen abraham arose to meet the coming messiah the glory of the lord was risen upon abraham and his family amen behold darkness shall cover sodom and gross doctors the people but the lord shall arise upon thee children of abraham and his glory shall be seen somewhere else but his glory shall be seen upon thee amen if we want to see the glory of the lord look at his people amen amen his glory shall be seen upon thee amen now the promise was given to abraham alone he was looking for that blessed hope and the glory is appearing of this great god amen we find the bible tells us in hebrews 11 10 that abraham was looking for a city which had foundations was building and making his god amen he was looking for the king of the city because he met the king of that city amen he was looking for a city which had foundations he met him amen and melchizedek and then he met him at evening time he came to him in the form of an angel at evening time and the purpose of the visit was twofold i don't know what you came to church here tonight for amen by getting involved in the service don't be distracted amen hallelujah he came amen and with a truthful purpose one was to bring a message that it was time for sarah's body to be changed amen because it was the time for the promised sun to come amen amen 28 days according to the time of life it was going to be a changing of sarah's body amen it was going to be a changing of abraham hallelujah abraham was the only one noticed at this dissension only abraham entertained him when he came only abraham welcomed him only abraham recognized him amen to sort of he was the unwelcome christ amen they rejected him but abraham fed him abraham that communion with him at the end in time with his great god at evening time amen how did abraham recognize him amen hallelujah the grace of god had allowed abraham to recognize who was those men coming to him and the final sign that abraham and sarah had received was god in flesh attack of the son of man discerning their hearts with his back turned to the tent we also received the final sign to the gentile age this world will not see another sign of the revealing of jesus christ amen the final sign has been on display but they have rejected it when he stood there night after night with his back turned to them and he said i would turn my back and he discerned their hearts they were looking for entertainment amen the news report is that during brother branham's sermon these denominational people used to be asleep he used to be wandering and walking around but as soon as it came time for the discernment everyone was at attention they thought it was some entertainment but it was god in flesh again but they could not recognize it they thought that this just was just a gifted man and like these jealous type of brothers they wanted to lust after the gift that's what they wanted they wanted popularity they wanted fame they wanted to show like they got some kind of power but the only power that we have is the power of the holy ghost amen hallelujah the second purpose was the time of investigating judgment he come to judge sodom for their wickedness now in that day this was breaking news to sodom and exclusive flash across every publication the most popular magazine in sodom and gomorrah had published pictures of this unusual sighting and they called it a mystic cloud amen they thought it was some ufos amen or some extra terrestrial activity hallelujah wherever god's people are there is always terrestrial activity amen because the bible says in psalms 34 and verse 7 that the angel of the lord encountered around them that fear him amen amen amen so there's always going to be the supernatural element attached to the children of god people are never going to understand us because of the supernatural now in the midst of judgment abraham steps into an intercessory role to stop the judgment and the destruction of sodom but notice abraham himself could not go down to sodom and gomorrah amen to plead with lot and his family probably had he gone face to face he might have convinced the entire family to flee from solomon gomorrah but that was not his ministry that part of the ministry was over they now had to listen to the two angels amen i hope we're learning tonight there's stages in the journey the stages in the ministry of the bride amen abraham was having an intimate conversation with god regarding the salvation of lot but he could not physically go down to sodom we cannot go back to egypt we cannot go down to these denominational settings where they have rejected christ they have got to listen now to the angels that were sent to them they have their own angels amen the first time locked in his family were physically captured he raised up an army and deliver them but this was the time when the book is now open amen and judgment is set he cannot do the same because now sodom has souls that are in prison they refuse to believe that this was the coming of the angels and the men of sodom amen refused to believe the sign hallelujah now when abraham looked at this same publication he told sarah look at these pictures that's the same one who appeared to us a man the same one whispered love secrets telling us to turn the picture to the right amen hallelujah let's focus on the 12th verse now teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world amen we must live in present time amen present time has present conditions that need to be met amen we cannot be living in in 2022 and be trapped back in the 1960s if you were receiving a baptist message you'd be sitting here in 2022 but your mind will be transported back your spirit and your soul will be transported back to a time gone by if i was preaching the message of loser he'll be sinning in 2022 but you'll be receiving a spirit from a time gone by same with the spirit of wesley and that's why the churches have denominated and they cannot progress but the bride of jesus christ is on the move amen we are not stuck in 1965 amen but the bride has been on the move the holy spirit has been leading his church amen hallelujah what we find in the church world in their present world what's their condition in the present world amen we're talking about ii titus 2 and 12. amen says in the present world what is the present world looking for the prophet tells us they are looking for a superman amen but the church is looking for that blessed hope the bride is looking for that blessed hope but the church is looking for a wretched pope someone who can step in on the scene and solve the world problems they're looking for a superman who can solve the economic crisis they're looking for a man who can solve the political crisis looking for a man who can unite the religious crisis that we have but don't you worry they are best equipped with their superman because he was a writer on the scene and he has been riding in deception on a religious white horse so he can tick that box for them a man a deadly red horse to a black horse and is now in a mixed colored horse a pay loss yes amen and he has a name called death and the bible says that hell follow him amen but we also have a superman amen in the beginning was the word and the word was with god amen amen and the word was god and the word became flesh and the word dwelt amongst us amen a superman something that the world had never seen before the only time the world had witnessed this kind of a man was in genesis amen a man with authority a man with power a man with control over the earth like what adam was given control over the earth amen hallelujah our superman has come to equip a super woman in this hour amen to make a super church and a super race and we are clothed with his super grace amen the condition of the bride of christ when he is complete with her she is fully clothed this bride is fully clothed when our superman is finished with us amen she is dressed in royal apparel radiant and beautiful the church is equipped with power holy ghost power resurrection power an invincible army full of revelation hearts turn back to the fathers but the condition of their superman satan's bride is naked he is wretched he is blind and they don't even know it satan's bride is powerless yes less revelation no power but they are well equipped like their husband they have the same qualities of their husband because they can deceive the whole world that they are the church of the living god she took the spirit of her husband and in deception she is deceiving him through the economical move amen equipped like a husband to deceive him equip like a mother amen making people believe that they are the church of god but their hearts have not been turned back to their father their hearts have been turned back to their mother mystery babylon and her daughters amen amen amen hallelujah let's read some about this church amen let's see a prophet with prophetic insight speak about the church let's pick this up brother caleb he's quoting first timothy four and one and he's he's reading here this is in the church age book and he says now the spirit speaketh expressly why are we dealing with this remember what the scripture says deny ungodliness only lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world i'm trying to show you the condition of the present world [Music] first timothy 4 and 1 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith we've seen it amen they are departing from the faith daily you'll see it on youtube daily everyday one popping up why am i here [Music] amen what are they doing giving here to seducing spirits you see what's doing it today seducing spirits amen doctrines of devils now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the world just as we showed you that antichrist means anti-word so these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends that's the present world we live in have you ever noticed how these people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear [Music] they say that if the people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow you'll find that spirit notice it's a spirit we are dealing with even if your message church tells you if you leave the church you're gonna die you leave the shirt you're going to be the accident spirits trying to control the people [Music] amen notice how these people like judas are out for money they get you to sell all you have and give it to them and their schemes let's go preachers in every denominational pulpit the other prophet now discerning it how many of you know spirits do not die same spirits operating back then he's operating in these men today it says they they get you to sell all you have and give it to them and their schemes who wants to fund a bmw who wants to fund a mercedes-benz they spend more time on offerings than the world i mean if you can say amen to that you ever been in one of these services they spend more time on offering than the word is this a prophet or what and i guarantee you it may have not been so bad back then they have gotten progressively worse amen who attempt to operate gifts will make use of a gift which has a margin of error in it then ask for money and neglect the word and call it of god all and people will go to them and bear with them and support them yes yo this will look like it's talking about present present present times telling you they will support it believe them not knowing it is the way of what death yes the land is full of carnal impersonators in the last day they will try to imitate their prophet messenger that's what you are seeing tonight in the world they are trying to imitate him the seven sons of steve are trying to imitate paul simon the sorcerer tried to imitate peter their impersonations will be carnal they won't be able to produce what the prophet produces let me read it again they won't be able to producers to produce what the true prophet produces when he says the revival is over they will go around claiming a great revelation that what the people have is exactly right and god is going to do bigger and more wonderful things amongst the people this is your here this is your season and what does he say and the people will fall for it year after year they are better than noah year after year they can wait for that one promise this is your year this is your season some of them gone old and grey they're still waiting because you cannot reproduce a lie only the original seed can be reproduced you don't believe me look at everything the prophet prophesied about and see it come to fruition i'm talking about the bride i'm talking about your life hallelujah amen i'm talking about the super church the super race everything he said this bride will be she is amen now these same false prophets will claim that the messenger of the last day is not a theologian so we ought not to be heard they won't be able to produce what the messenger can they won't be vindicated by god as the last day profit is but were they great swelling words and with the weight of the worldwide the tory notoriety i can't see it they will warn the people not to hear that man amen and they will say he teaches wrong how can a man prophesy what they're going to say about him they are running exactly true to their fathers the pharisees who are of the devil there is placing them for they claim both john and jesus taught error now why do these false prophets come against the true prophet and discredit his teaching because they are running through to form as did their forefathers when in the days of heir they would stood makaya there were 400 of them and all of them were in agreement and by them all saying the same thing they fooled the people you got school of the prophets now you've got bible schools you've got seminaries amen and all of these cemeteries but one prophet he says now watch remember we're speaking about just one man abraham and his generation he says but one prophet just one was right and all the rest was wrong now when they ask you that question you mean only you're all right yes i say yes amen you know they asked that question you mean to say all the other churches are wrong and only you are right yes just one he says was right and all the rest wrong because god had committed the revelation to only one aren't you glad you're connected to that one yes amen amen why are you connected to that one you were sent to you the old i sent you elijah the prophet he is the one the revelation was sent to and he came to reveal it to you he says beware of false prophets for their ravening wills if you are still in any doubt about this as god by his spirit to fill you and lead you for the very elect can't be full fool did you get there there isn't any man can fool you amen why is he emphasizing this because of what happened in the garden of eden he's saying there's no man that can fool this bride paul could not fool any elect had he been wrong and in the first ephesian age the elect there could not be food for they tried the false prophets and the prophets are found there to be liars and put them out his sheep hear his voice and they follow him he says i believe it amen bringing us now to verse 13 looking for that blessed hope [Music] we are not looking at now what paul was telling us there we have to live above the things of this present world and we are looking for this blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our lord and our savior jesus christ amen just like our abraham was looking for him we are looking for him amen what are we looking for ask yourself the question what are you looking for in this life are you looking for a better bank balance every morning you wake up to see your bank balance and every night you look to see the bank balance amen hoping that somehow it will change but all you have is change amen some are waiting maybe for kaiser chiefs sundowns to win the league some are praying for a miracle that man united is revived and win the league amen you'll have to wait forever for profana bafana to win anything but they think that that's what will bring them satisfaction in this life and that's what they're looking for they will invest time they will invest money they will buy the merchandise because that's where their treasure you'll never see them wear a jesus cap or a cross or something associated with the gospel of jesus christ amen some are looking for a woman to rescue them some are looking for a man to take me out of my misery what are you looking for some are looking for numbers phone numbers lotto numbers powerball numbers some love the book of numbers amen but what ask yourself the question now what are you looking for daily in your life amen a better house a better car amen we have to know what to look for some say some are looking for the wrong things even in the message some are looking for a return ministry some say they are waiting for the physical mark of the beast some are waiting for los angeles to sink some are waiting for the atomic bomb to fall some are waiting for trump to be re-elected but the prophet says that millions will miss it he said millions will go to church thinking they are being saved but he says they will miss it he says it's already coming god and you don't know it why they had the wrong expectation they were looking for the wrong thing what is that blessed hope he says we are looking for that blessed hope what is that blessed hope what is that we are looking for we are looking for glorification amen why because the fall brought sin and death but jesus blood cleanses us from sin and gives us the blessed hope of eternal life amen right now this body is subject to death but our souls have been turned heavenly amen we know that if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we already have one waiting for us we are eternal as god is eternal because we are from eternity but we stepped into space of time amen to fulfill the purpose of god and amen the most purpose driven people on the face of the earth is the pride of the lord jesus christ amen people talk about a purpose-driven life you know that an author wrote a purpose-driven life a man sold millions and millions and millions of copies but people after having read that book still have no purpose because they have not come from the original source it's come from some man's idea but we have a purpose god has given us our purpose amen we know our commission we know we are the end of the gentile dispensation we know that we are asked to prophesy again amen it's a fresh word of prophecy hallelujah amen the most purpose-driven people on the earth is the bride of the lord jesus christ amen people who possess a gene of god we are not living unfulfilled lives we should not feel hopeless or helpless but god has come to give us a purpose in life amen we have a hope and we have a future we have an expected end amen the end was shown to us we know how it all ends we are at the end we are waiting for the end how is it going to end amen we have heard the shout out amen there's two phases to the shout there's one jesus coming to mary hello and there's one going and calling martha and saying the master has come and call it for thee and she secretly left the house to go where jesus was he is here he is here amen amen he's a monster living and what did he reveal to them that he is the resurrection and the life the shout but he is on his way to the grave with the voice of the resurrection amen he is on his way the shark was his descent amen but he's on his way to that sixth dimension the shark was telling you he is leaving the heavens that's why there's silence in heaven amen amen but he is coming from that sixth from that seventh going to that sixth tying right in line with beyond the curtain of time that jesus will come to the dimension and you'll be judged by what you preached and depending on whether you accept it or not we will amen go back to the earth and we will pick up our bodies amen hallelujah amen we are waiting for the voice of the resurrection and the voice of the resurrection is none other than the voice of the lord jesus christ the bible says that we will not prevent them which are asleep nothing we can do will stop will prevent them will hinder them from coming forth you can go and put concrete over their graves you can go and put a tombstone over their grave but ain't no grave gonna hold this body down hold this body down when i hear that trumpet sound i'm gonna rise right out of the ground ain't no grave gonna hold this body down they are waiting for the voice of the archangel and only christ's voice can do that when he goes to that sixth dimension and bring back the saints from paul and his group to branham and his group amen they will come back to the earth to pick up their mortal bodies and together at the last trump we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we'll step right in line amen what we are speaking about tonight is not chicken food what we are speaking about tonight amen is eager food this is what we are looking for but this is what has been revealed to us we are looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god have you seen it appearing amen amen hallelujah amen amen oh bless the name of the lord we have seen it appearing what's the attraction on the mountain amen what is all the noise up on the mountain 27 miles high and 30 miles wide what is this sands don't know what it is up to today they are baffled about it amen and you know every time the supernatural of god comes in on the scene there comes mr skeptic but there's also the true believer we don't need no punctuation amen hallelujah amen why are they are still disputing about the cloud and who is it that's up there that same one has come down here and he stepped into 16 elements hallelujah some of you did in the enemy amen god has come to tabernacle with his people hallelujah it's god in bright form amen don't regurgitate it swallow if it's tough too if you can't you ask your brother to chew it for you and feed you be to be amen amen we are told to watch and pray when we are looking for that blessed hope let's close with this mark chapter 13 verse 32 amen mark 13 32 amen we've seen the blessed hope we have seen the appearing he says but of that day and that hour note no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father but then lord what are we going to do give us something to do he says take heed watch and pray amen for you know not when the time is for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house he has descended and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and it commanded the partner to watch yeah he re-emphasizes he says watch he therefore for you know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight at midnight cry when jesus comes again was there cry at midnight what was that cry beholder bridegroom coming going out to meet him [Music] while the car growing or in the morning unless suddenly you will find you sleeping and what i say unto you i say unto all watch and in luke 18 verse 8 our last scripture he says nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great god and our lord jesus christ amen let's examine our lives and see what are you looking for what are you looking for are you looking for the right things in this life amen stop chasing material dreams stop chasing carnal desires look for the blessed hope look for the glorious appearing of our great god amen the hour is getting urgent the time is drawing near amen and like the bible says amen we are much farther than when we first believe we are much closer now than when we first believed believe it or not you are the final ministry that will sweep this gentile generation amen you are called to prophesy again why is your ministry so unique i'm going to close now why is your ministry so unique why is john asked to prophesy again it's the first time it's an unsealed prophecy prior to this the book was sealed from paul to wesley the book was closed captioning not [Music] the seals it's the available of redemption so prophecy the earth must hear one more time redemption in its fullness being preached a prophecy must sweep the earth with a complete mystery of redemption you see why your ministry is so important now must let's see if you got a chance on a saturday okay see when you're free just tell somebody does it sound urgent thou must prophesy again and it goes quiet the book ends the chapter ends and it opens up revelation 11 coming to the two messengers to the jews if we know our part let's do it well if we know apart amen let's not do it half-heartedly thou must prophesy again so when the son of man cometh will i find faith on the earth and our lord jesus admonishing his bride watch and pray through seven watchers now they've watched we had a watchman on the tower who told us watchmen what of the night amen let's stand and give god praise amen hallelujah looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great god amen and our savior jesus christ if you have been struggling with something the bible tells us deny ungodliness deny worldly lust live soberly before the lord live righteously live godly in this present world and right now in this present world when all hell is unleashed upon the earth it takes the grace of god for us to be able to stand i'm if you can say you're standing in this world through your own merits with all the
