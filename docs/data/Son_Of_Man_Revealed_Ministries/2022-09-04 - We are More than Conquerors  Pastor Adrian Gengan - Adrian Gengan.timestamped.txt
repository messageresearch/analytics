[13:07] amen
[13:09] some of you end up taking away more
[13:11] stuff from your father's house than you

[13:18] amen and i hope you didn't come you're
[13:20] full this morning
[13:22] amen i'm if you came full
[13:25] but come empty out amen amen come amen
[13:28] with a pot big pot
[13:30] amen and take as much as the lord will
[13:32] give to us this morning amen hallelujah
[13:36] amen so if you've got our slideshow amen
[13:38] we can go to there this morning we'll be
[13:39] speaking we are more than conquerors
[13:43] hallelujah
[13:44] amen
[13:45] there's always an element to god that
[13:47] gives us more
[13:49] notice he didn't say we are conquerors
[13:52] he says we are more than conquerors
[13:54] there's been many men that have been
[13:56] labeled conquerors but this bride has
[13:59] the attributes of our husband and he
[14:02] says in romans 8 37
[14:04] amen he says
[14:07] nay in all these things we are more than
[14:10] conquerors through him
[14:13] that loved us
[14:14] amen watch where it's coming from now
[14:17] the original source
[14:19] conquering power is coming through him
[14:22] who loved us
[14:23] jesus wants you to know that you are
[14:25] loved this morning
[14:27] and because he loves you you are more
[14:29] than a conqueror
[14:31] amen you may be seated amen may the lord
[14:33] have blessings to the reading of his
[14:35] word amen hallelujah amen so we look at
[14:39] the definition of a conqueror
[14:42] and it's one who conquers one who wins
[14:44] in a country
[14:46] wins a country in war
[14:48] a sub-jews or he subjugates people and
[14:51] he overcomes an adversary
[14:54] amen that's what a conqueror is amen and
[14:57] the only reason that we are victorious
[14:59] in this life is
[15:01] like the scripture says it's through him
[15:04] that loved us
[15:06] amen our victory doesn't lie within
[15:09] ourselves
[15:10] [Music]
[15:11] it's not our own human ability but it's
[15:14] coming through jesus christ alone
[15:18] amen stop looking at one another's
[15:20] thoughts and mistakes amen amen
[15:23] hallelujah
[15:25] it is through jesus christ
[15:27] amen the love of god for his children is
[15:30] so vast and so deep and so far-reaching
[15:34] that god wants us to know that nothing
[15:37] can separate us from his great love for
[15:41] us
[15:42] amen amen hallelujah
[15:45] amen aren't you thankful for his great
[15:47] love amen hallelujah
[15:51] now we find here that the apostle paul
[15:53] uses the phrase of more than conquerors
[15:56] and it only appears in the new testament
[15:59] it refers to those who gain a great
[16:02] surpassing victory
[16:04] meaning that you are completely
[16:06] victorious
[16:09] amen
[16:10] more than a conqueror means that you are
[16:13] completely victorious
[16:15] it means the battle is already worn
[16:18] even though you don't see it with your
[16:20] physical eyes but through the
[16:22] supernatural eye
[16:24] the battle is already won
[16:27] amen it means gaining a surpassing
[16:30] victory completely victorious and to
[16:33] carry away and overwhelming victory
[16:38] amen let me break it down for you
[16:40] more than a conqueror meaning that you
[16:42] didn't win in overtime
[16:45] [Music]
[16:47] you don't win by one point it wasn't
[16:50] fought me
[16:52] hello
[16:53] [Music]
[16:55] amen
[16:56] the score wasn't 4-3
[16:59] overwhelming victory means you gave them
[17:02] 28 mil
[17:07] and like we use that term
[17:10] you guys know what i'm talking about
[17:12] when your team wins what you say we gave
[17:14] them a hiding yeah
[17:18] and that's what we are
[17:20] we are giving the devil the hiding of
[17:22] his life amen all right amen in this
[17:25] change
[17:27] we are giving the devil the hiding of
[17:29] his life
[17:31] amen one time the husband kicked him and
[17:33] slapped him
[17:34] laying hell
[17:36] now the wife is following suit
[17:41] amen took him out of your house he came
[17:44] out of your children amen claim the
[17:46] victory in jesus name you are more than
[17:49] a conqueror
[17:51] don't let satan come and rule your
[17:53] family you are the head of their family
[17:56] take authority stand on the word of god
[17:59] amen
[18:01] hallelujah
[18:02] amen now we know throughout history
[18:05] there have been many empires
[18:07] amen many people who have conquered in
[18:09] their time the lord showed us amen
[18:12] through prophet daniel's vision that
[18:14] there would become four kingdoms
[18:17] do you remember the dream that king
[18:18] nebuchadnezzar had
[18:20] there will be four kingdoms
[18:22] amen hallelujah
[18:24] amen i'd like everybody to be in the
[18:26] service if there's somebody outside i
[18:28] want them all to come into the service
[18:30] there's enough room in the cross here
[18:33] amen there's not an overflow amen with
[18:35] the same submission if anyone's right
[18:37] around please bring them back into the
[18:38] service amen
[18:41] amen participation can you please check
[18:44] amen
[18:46] throughout history there's been many
[18:47] empires
[18:49] yes amen
[18:52] the babylonian empire amen and you
[18:55] remember you were shown this image
[18:57] that's right
[18:58] amen have we got a picture of the image
[19:00] there the babylonian empire
[19:02] the media persian empire the greece and
[19:05] empire and the roman empire
[19:08] amen these four kingdoms will rule the
[19:11] world until the time until the end time
[19:15] until another kingdom is being brought
[19:18] upon the earth
[19:20] amen
[19:21] men like nebuchadnezzar like darius like
[19:24] alexander the great amen hallelujah men
[19:28] like napoleon men like hitler were
[19:30] regarded as conquerors
[19:32] [Music]
[19:33] amen
[19:34] they conquered the world in certain
[19:36] stages of their journey
[19:38] but their victory did not last
[19:41] why
[19:42] amen all of them were victorious for a
[19:45] time for a season
[19:47] but they were not over able to overcome
[19:50] themselves
[19:53] they were not able to overcome the human
[19:55] weakness
[19:56] and each one of them had flaws that led
[19:59] them to be defeated
[20:00] [Music]
[20:02] what is that teaching us we need to
[20:04] overcome ourselves in this battle
[20:07] we need to die to self
[20:10] amen but there is one man
[20:13] who came and he conquered everything
[20:17] that was on the earth and everything
[20:19] that was in hell
[20:21] amen this man at the age of 33 years old
[20:25] amen he became not just a conqueror but
[20:29] he became a great and a mighty conqueror
[20:32] [Music]
[20:33] the man i'm talking about is none other
[20:36] than our lord jesus christ
[20:38] amen this is no ordinary man
[20:41] amen he was prophesied to come in the
[20:43] book of messiah as i said unto us his
[20:46] son is born unto us a child is given
[20:50] amen and his name shall be called
[20:52] counselor
[20:53] amen he is not called counselor for
[20:56] nothing counsel with the lord you're
[20:58] going through a situation seek the great
[21:01] counselor amen he is the prince of peace
[21:04] your trouble in mind go to the prince of
[21:06] peace amen amen hallelujah he is the
[21:10] mighty god
[21:12] there is no true mighty god there is
[21:14] only one mighty god

[21:20] this was god in flesh
[21:23] hallelujah
[21:24] amen god and morphe himself amen
[21:27] hallelujah
[21:29] amen
[21:30] now the greatest enemy that man faced
[21:33] and still faces today
[21:35] is an enemy called them
[21:40] amen
[21:41] there's one thing you can cannot escape
[21:44] if the lord carries
[21:48] amen
[21:49] and that is death
[21:54] amen
[21:55] one thing
[21:56] we cannot escape
[21:59] we got an appointment
[22:01] the bible says it's the point of man
[22:03] wants to live
[22:05] amen and then too
[22:09] don't be
[22:10] scared because we see death through
[22:14] different eyes yes you remember pastor
[22:16] clive came and preached and he said i
[22:18] want to make death seem silly to you
[22:20] amen hallelujah we are more than
[22:23] conquerors
[22:25] amen
[22:26] don't care amen what satan can do to the
[22:28] flesh
[22:30] yes but we have eternal life
[22:32] amen we have passed from death and to
[22:34] life amen amen so jesus changed our
[22:38] destiny
[22:39] our destiny was hell
[22:41] amen we were guilty of sin amen we were
[22:44] bound for hell but christ our redeemer
[22:47] died on the cross
[22:49] he died for the sinners and paid all his
[22:52] dues amen hallelujah christ paid with
[22:57] his own blood glory amen he didn't have
[23:00] to do it
[23:01] jesus didn't have to do it
[23:03] amen but the prophet says love
[23:06] constrained him amen that's what it was
[23:10] he says love in his great bosom went out
[23:13] to adam's fallen race
[23:16] and redeemed them through his son christ
[23:19] jesus
[23:21] amen he says look
[23:23] notice this god falls through the bride
[23:26] in the group
[23:28] watch the mystery now
[23:30] he's preaching this
[23:31] it is the rising of the sun 1965
[23:35] he is telling you that god foresaw the
[23:37] bride in the groom
[23:40] god saw you in jesus christ amen
[23:43] amen
[23:44] he said see to save his wife like adam
[23:47] he had to go with her
[23:49] yes adam knew what he was doing he
[23:52] didn't know what she was doing
[23:54] but adam walked out with his wife and
[23:57] jesus took his wife's place
[24:01] amen jesus took your place
[24:05] amen
[24:06] and became sin for her remember he
[24:09] became you he stood your punishment that
[24:12] you might stand in his place
[24:14] amen he stood in your place that you
[24:16] might stand in his place what in love
[24:20] what a fellowship
[24:22] what a joy divine
[24:24] leaning on the everlasting arms
[24:27] he says how can we deny it how can we do
[24:30] anything but love him friend amen amen
[24:33] somebody say amen
[24:36] christ died in your place
[24:38] amen sometimes we have taken that for
[24:40] granted
[24:41] sometimes we worry too much
[24:44] amen that we do not value our salvation
[24:47] amen but i want to tell you in another
[24:49] colloquial job this morning catch you

[25:08] passed out along the journey

[25:12] they put a strong chemical in front of
[25:14] their nose some of you probably know the
[25:16] name i don't
[25:20] not chloroform now the devil uses
[25:23] colorful smelling salts smelling salts
[25:27] you heard that
[25:29] and then the person wakes up
[25:31] that's what we come to do in the house
[25:33] of the lord this morning you probably
[25:35] walked in like a zombie here this
[25:36] morning
[25:38] yes praise god the souls are going to be
[25:40] spread this morning amen i'm going to be
[25:42] throwing salt from the purpose

[26:00] amen so keep your mouth open some of you
[26:03] are lacking salt you know if you lack
[26:04] salt there's a problem in your body

[26:09] every time you say amen i'm going to
[26:10] throw salty amen
[26:12] amen amen hallelujah
[26:15] amen and he said jesus went to calvary
[26:18] one day how many of you know amen that
[26:20] jesus went to calvary
[26:22] amen and there on the cross once and for
[26:25] all he settled the same question yes
[26:27] amen
[26:29] right
[26:30] he conquered the greatest enemy that man
[26:33] ever had
[26:36] yes he conquered death once and for all
[26:40] that's why death is no more fearful for
[26:42] us yes
[26:44] amen we don't do not have to wonder what
[26:46] lays within the next dimension
[26:50] we know that when we close the eyes and
[26:52] breathe our last breath we step into a
[26:55] new body

[30:27] for me
[30:28] is the way you came from
[30:31] i never saw you for the last five years
[30:38] i wonder if if the rapture was based on
[30:40] church attendance how many of us will
[30:42] make it
[30:43] right
[30:44] but thank god it's not based on church
[30:46] attendance

[30:53] the lord better
[30:55] why can't we do remember what that word

[31:28] blood
[31:29] amen he was so anointed with the power
[31:32] of god that god raised him up
[31:34] triumphantly from the dead amen and he
[31:37] tore down the dominion of satan
[31:40] amen amen he went to the lowest parts of
[31:42] the earth
[31:44] and he was raised to the highest of
[31:46] heavens
[31:47] amen he is the undisputed
[31:51] undefeated
[31:53] champion of love
[31:55] amen one time this champion didn't even
[31:57] have a time to be placed to be born
[32:00] amen or place to die
[32:03] the place where he was born was a border
[32:06] place and the place where the lady's
[32:08] body was a borrowed place
[32:11] amen he said foxes have old and the
[32:14] birds have nests but the son of man had
[32:16] nowhere to lay his head
[32:19] amen hallelujah amen but then god after
[32:22] he resurrected him
[32:24] he said he exalted him so high
[32:28] and gave him a crown
[32:30] and a name above

[42:49] power of the enemy

[42:52] god made a search light from heaven
[42:55] and he started to point that searchlight
[42:57] on the earth
[42:58] and he's hunting down and defeating
[43:01] every principality and every power that
[43:04] is coming against you amen amen he tore
[43:08] down and spoiled everything that satan
[43:10] had
[43:11] the prophet goes on to say in the mighty
[43:13] conqueror he is the mighty conqueror his
[43:15] dominion is from everlasting to
[43:18] everlasting
[43:19] his delegates are those who love him
[43:22] are you one of these delegates
[43:24] the
[43:25] saying his delegates are those who love
[43:28] him amen amen and are willing to
[43:32] die for him
[43:35] he raised
[43:36] he has raised from the dead this morning
[43:38] and living amongst us that's present
[43:41] tense
[43:42] amen do you believe this
[43:44] amen hallelujah now we're talking about
[43:48] a mighty conqueror now we said a
[43:50] conqueror most of the time they it's
[43:52] fought in a battlefield and they
[43:53] overcome a war
[43:54] amen so the mind was the battleground of
[43:58] the soul
[44:00] amen
[44:01] the slideshow should be easy because
[44:03] i've set it up amen all you have to do
[44:04] is press the next arrow amen the mind of
[44:07] the battleground is the soul
[44:10] the mind is the battleground of the soul
[44:12] amen
[44:13] and the first battle that was ever
[44:15] fought was what where
[44:17] preached me this morning was 14
[44:21] heaven
[44:22] amen when michael and his angels fought
[44:25] against lucifer yes
[44:27] someone said online
[44:30] hey guys
[44:31] brothers sisters come on now
[44:35] amen
[44:38] the first battle was fought in heaven
[44:40] amen i can see where your mind is this
[44:42] morning
[44:43] amen
[44:45] someone stream online
[44:48] now sin also did not originate in the
[44:51] earth it originated in heaven
[44:54] it's in his unbelief
[44:55] amen and it was cast out of heaven we
[44:58] showed you our revelation 9 that is cast
[45:00] out again
[45:02] that star falling from heaven and he
[45:04] says felon who human beings
[45:07] amen then the battle move from angels
[45:11] to human battles
[45:13] these battles that you're facing it's
[45:15] different powers oppressing you amen 200
[45:19] million demons let loose from the river
[45:21] euphrates
[45:23] amen
[45:25] satan come to destroy god's creation he
[45:27] wasn't happy about what was going on in
[45:29] eden so he came to destroy god's
[45:32] creation and
[45:34] the battle began on earth
[45:36] and the battle has been raging ever
[45:37] since now the prophet says here
[45:40] any battle can be put in a raid they
[45:43] first have to choose the place where the
[45:45] battle is to be fought
[45:48] and he says the human mind
[45:50] was chosen for the place of the battle
[45:55] because decisions are made in the mind
[46:03] that is where satan meets you
[46:06] you've got to make your choice
[46:08] now i i want to break this down because
[46:11] it's not always just spiritual battles
[46:14] that satan gets you through
[46:16] he's not always going to fight you like
[46:18] you know through the preaching of the
[46:19] word like you're always studying the
[46:21] message and he's going to fight you with
[46:22] this doctrine and that doctrine
[46:24] he's going to affect your natural life
[46:27] he's going to introduce you to the wrong
[46:28] type of girl
[46:30] but decisions are made where
[46:34] some men go mental when they meet a girl
[46:38] they can't think anymore
[46:40] some women go mental
[46:43] amen
[46:45] you know many people have
[46:47] ruined their lives like that right
[46:51] so watch out satan can get you because
[46:54] if they can get you defeated in your
[46:56] five senses and in your spirit
[47:01] he is attempting to bring doubt and fear
[47:03] into your soul
[47:06] so he gets you through other ways
[47:08] he gets you through sickness
[47:10] amen
[47:12] he gets you a man through in fighting in
[47:15] the home
[47:16] husband and wife conflict
[47:19] children and and parents conflict
[47:22] what is he doing he's watching your case
[47:26] watching your case
[47:28] and if you cannot identify that this is
[47:31] the enemy
[47:33] he is going to defeat you
[47:36] because that situation is going to
[47:38] consume you
[47:40] and you know what's going to happen
[47:42] to the ramesh they're going to eat the
[47:44] water
[47:45] and like that frog in that bathtub
[47:48] as the water is heated up
[47:50] the situation around you becomes normal
[47:53] that seeing that person in sin becomes
[47:56] just a normal thing
[47:57] it doesn't affect you anymore
[48:02] amen
[48:04] amen we compromise with sin and unbelief
[48:09] the prophet didn't compromise with bully
[48:10] paul
[48:12] he told him as long as you're living
[48:13] that kind of life
[48:15] you cannot live in this house
[48:18] take your things and humber
[48:25] amen
[48:28] no but we want to nurture sin
[48:31] we're not concerned about the salvation
[48:33] of that person's soul
[48:36] amen
[48:40] but where he says here the human mind
[48:41] was chosen for the place of the battle
[48:43] because decisions are made in the mind
[48:46] there is where satan meets you
[48:49] and you've got to make your choice
[48:53] amen i want you to know that we are not
[48:56] in a cold war
[48:57] with the enemy

[49:05] ground yes you've got battle ships there
[49:08] amen you got these tanks
[49:11] on the field
[49:12] you got every artillery you got atomic
[49:15] warfare if you need it
[49:17] but the battle is hot and heavy at the
[49:19] end time
[49:20] because all hell is poured out upon the
[49:23] earth the bible says that hell followed
[49:25] that fourth horse rider
[49:27] his name was dead and hell followed him
[49:30] amen the prophet father goes on to say
[49:33] he says all hell is poured out on the
[49:34] earth and he says as much as hell is
[49:37] poured out on the earth all heaven is
[49:39] come down
[49:43] with the captain of the host amen the
[49:45] mighty angel descending
[49:48] come to set the battle in the rain amen
[49:51] this is not a cold war where we apply
[49:53] sanctions on the devil

[49:59] satan if you leave me alone with a
[50:01] stinger

[50:30] correct armor

[50:44] armor was given to us amen and the right
[50:47] training was given to us

[50:51] brethren be strong in the lord
[50:54] and in the power of his might
[50:57] put on the whole armor of god that you
[51:00] might be able to stand against the wiles
[51:02] of the devil
[51:04] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[51:07] but against principalities
[51:10] against powers against rulers of the
[51:12] darkness of this world against spiritual
[51:15] wickedness in high places
[51:17] [Music]
[51:19] wherefore take unto the whole armor of
[51:21] god that you might be able to withstand
[51:24] in the evil day
[51:26] and having done all to stand he says
[51:29] stand there for having your loins good
[51:31] with truth
[51:33] and having the breastplate of
[51:35] righteousness yes take your
[51:37] righteousness that's your breastplate
[51:40] amen it's not your righteousness but
[51:42] it's god's righteousness
[51:44] because our righteousness is like filthy
[51:46] red
[51:47] but take the righteousness of god and
[51:49] put it as a breastplate amen he says
[51:52] your feet short with the preparation of
[51:54] the gospel and take your shield of faith
[51:58] yes
[51:58] amen faith is a shield
[52:02] amen and you are able to quench the
[52:04] fiery death of the wicked
[52:07] amen and the helmet of salvation
[52:10] salvation is a helmet
[52:13] wait well
[52:15] amen

[52:26] sword of the spirit
[52:28] the holy spirit is the sword

[52:32] there but he's talking about the holy
[52:34] spirit
[52:35] the holy spirit that possesses you

[1:02:09] separate us from the love of god which
[1:02:12] is in christ jesus our lord amen he
[1:02:14] fortified us the prophet goes on to say
[1:02:17] now we're moving very quickly now amen
[1:02:19] the prophet says he gave man one thing
[1:02:22] to be fortified around and that's his
[1:02:24] word
[1:02:25] amen he gave man nothing else but his
[1:02:27] word to fortify themselves around but

[1:03:00] is faster than that
[1:03:04] amen the word can go and annihilate the
[1:03:06] enemy

[1:03:09] word can go ill centurion servants
[1:03:12] it's quick
[1:03:14] it's powerful
[1:03:16] it's sharper than what the bible says
[1:03:18] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:03:20] piercing to the dividing asunder of the
[1:03:23] soul and the spirit
[1:03:25] amen
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:28] and the joints of the marrow oh that's a
[1:03:31] sharp blade
[1:03:33] penetrate the bone
[1:03:35] weighing into the metal i don't feel
[1:03:36] like marrow bone
[1:03:38] you know what i'm talking about then
[1:03:40] penetrating through that bone and it's
[1:03:43] the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:03:44] intents of the heart
[1:03:47] amen we were talking about that last
[1:03:49] night around the dinner table how the
[1:03:51] holy spirit can speak through the
[1:03:52] minister
[1:03:53] and discern the thoughts of the people
[1:03:56] you'll be thinking why is the pastor
[1:03:58] saying that
[1:04:00] you'll be even resenting what he's
[1:04:01] saying amen but the spirit is working
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:04] amen now
[1:04:06] let's recap we said that we are more
[1:04:09] than conquerors
[1:04:10] we have the overwhelming victory
[1:04:13] god gave us the armor
[1:04:16] right
[1:04:17] god gave us the dress where now what is
[1:04:19] god's dress fear for the church
[1:04:23] amen
[1:04:25] the prophet breaks us down
[1:04:28] he says
[1:04:29] god fortified his army
[1:04:32] with what
[1:04:33] himself
[1:04:35] in the form of
[1:04:36] prophets
[1:04:38] apostles teachers
[1:04:41] pastors
[1:04:45] what did he do
[1:04:46] what was god doing listen did you ever
[1:04:49] think what that offices of the church is
[1:04:53] it's god's dress
[1:04:56] inside dress
[1:04:57] an apostle a prophet a seer
[1:05:01] foresee before satan ever gets
[1:05:04] to do it
[1:05:06] now you see why if you don't subject
[1:05:08] yourself to the fivefold
[1:05:10] you won't have keen eyesight amen
[1:05:13] because the prophet is saying that the
[1:05:14] fivefold sees it even before satan can
[1:05:16] do it
[1:05:18] so what is the pastor he's a protector
[1:05:20] of his sheep amen he will tell you don't
[1:05:22] go down that avenue stay in this pasture
[1:05:26] watch now it gets beautiful
[1:05:28] he says
[1:05:29] what is it god dressed up in his church
[1:05:35] these offices is god's stress with
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:42] so you see why we should respect the
[1:05:44] office
[1:05:46] he says it's god's dress with
[1:05:50] when you see those officers pastors
[1:05:53] teachers evangelists what is that
[1:05:56] that's god's dress where
[1:06:01] what she breaks it down
[1:06:03] god's presence
[1:06:10] god's spirit
[1:06:13] working through man
[1:06:15] now i advise you to please respect the
[1:06:17] office yes
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:24] amen respect these officers yes listen
[1:06:27] to what he's saying it's god's dress
[1:06:28] sweet it's god's presence amongst his
[1:06:31] people because what avenue has he chosen
[1:06:34] mechanical devices
[1:06:36] no
[1:06:37] he has chosen man
[1:06:40] so he says god's spirit walking through
[1:06:42] man and if that offers denies any of
[1:06:44] this word then it's not god's dressing
[1:06:46] yes
[1:06:47] right that's what he says it's wolf in
[1:06:48] sheep's clothing right
[1:06:51] watch what he says now he says in things
[1:06:53] that are to be this is one of the late
[1:06:55] messages before he goes off the scene he
[1:06:57] says as i'm getting old and as i go
[1:06:59] along the road
[1:07:00] that this young fellows will come up and
[1:07:03] take this gospel
[1:07:05] in a less powerful way than it is now
[1:07:09] what is he saying
[1:07:10] there's that word again more
[1:07:13] more than conquerors
[1:07:16] but uh play the tapes
[1:07:18] i'm playing the tape now
[1:07:20] i'm reading the tape back to you
[1:07:28] i'm reading the tape back to you
[1:07:30] because sometimes
[1:07:31] some people don't listen they listen too
[1:07:33] fast or they listen too slow
[1:07:37] but when you read it
[1:07:39] let me read it again for jeffersonville
[1:07:43] amen this young fellows
[1:07:47] will come up to take this gospel
[1:07:50] in a more powerful way
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:06] and the enemy comes
[1:08:08] god will drop the standards
[1:08:13] you see what time we're living in
[1:08:14] brother joshua
[1:08:16] the standard is higher now
[1:08:19] here's a property in things that have to
[1:08:20] be
[1:08:21] one of his last messages that he's going
[1:08:23] to preach
[1:08:24] he's saying as the generations go have
[1:08:27] we had a few generations come by
[1:08:30] and the enemy comes in
[1:08:33] god keeps raising the standard higher
[1:08:35] and higher and higher
[1:08:39] pass the first pull
[1:08:40] second pull into the third pool
[1:08:43] until finally we'll meet with christ
[1:08:46] [Music]
[1:08:48] amen so let's stay with what the prophet
[1:08:50] said amen
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:54] he says here
[1:08:56] in things that are to be
[1:08:58] so that was in birth pains now he says
[1:09:00] these men if they pick up this and goes
[1:09:04] out with it they can make
[1:09:07] less sense to it
[1:09:09] there's a word again
[1:09:11] they'll make more sense to it
[1:09:14] see
[1:09:15] now what he's he's got an expectation
[1:09:18] for the young man that's following him
[1:09:20] he says to take it to a place
[1:09:25] to a higher level
[1:09:28] i just want to
[1:09:31] lay the fruits
[1:09:34] what is he laying
[1:09:36] so can we say that brother brandon lays
[1:09:38] the seed
[1:09:41] and who is he relying on to bring it to
[1:09:43] life
[1:09:44] then all they

[1:09:53] i'm part of the day
[1:09:57] they make it come to life amen
[1:10:02] the prophet laid the seat the fight for
[1:10:04] ministry brings you to life yes amen you
[1:10:06] can't make the prophet alive amen
[1:10:09] amen now we're going to close now
[1:10:13] we spoke about conquering the enemy we
[1:10:15] spoke about conquering and overcoming
[1:10:17] your situation overcoming your sickness
[1:10:19] overcoming your trial overcoming worry
[1:10:21] overcoming depression
[1:10:23] there's another fellow you must overcome
[1:10:26] brother branham calls him the greatest
[1:10:27] enemy
[1:10:29] who's there
[1:10:32] overcome yourself
[1:10:35] enemy number one
[1:10:37] the fresh man
[1:10:39] he says what is the meaning of conqueror
[1:10:41] of self to conquer yourselves means to
[1:10:44] dominate and take control of the
[1:10:46] difficulties you face
[1:10:49] brother goes on to say now i've often
[1:10:51] said the greatest enemy i got is william
[1:10:53] branham
[1:10:54] he is the one that gets in god's way
[1:10:57] amen
[1:11:00] put your name there now
[1:11:02] the greatest enemy is
[1:11:05] yourself
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:09] he is the one who gets in god's way
[1:11:12] god is driving and you say hey give me
[1:11:14] the steering wheel here
[1:11:17] god gone right you're saying hey i want
[1:11:19] to go left
[1:11:23] he is the one who gets what
[1:11:27] lazy
[1:11:29] he is the one that gets to play
[1:11:31] sometimes where he thinks he can do
[1:11:33] something about it
[1:11:37] and when he does that shoves god right
[1:11:40] out of the picture
[1:11:41] but when i can get rid of that guy
[1:11:45] when i can get to the place where he's
[1:11:46] out of the way then god can come over
[1:11:49] and do the things that william graham
[1:11:52] knows nothing about
[1:11:54] two things that adrian gender knows
[1:11:56] nothing about
[1:11:57] two things that ramish mabia knows
[1:11:59] nothing about
[1:12:02] if we can get out the way yes
[1:12:05] what am i saying overcome yourself
[1:12:09] get over yourself amen
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:13] god wants to take control
[1:12:17] then when that's when god can use you
[1:12:20] that's when he can use any of you he can
[1:12:22] use anybody when we get out of the way
[1:12:25] but as long as we got ourselves in the
[1:12:26] way then we cannot
[1:12:29] he says that's what every man needs is a
[1:12:31] loss of himself yes amen
[1:12:34] loss of ability
[1:12:36] loss of what he said
[1:12:37] that he might have complete healing to
[1:12:39] the holy spirit he says the housewife
[1:12:42] needs that the school boy needs that he
[1:12:44] says even our little children amen
[1:12:47] now you gotta know that you gotta fight
[1:12:50] for every inch of ground
[1:12:52] amen you gotta fight for every inch of
[1:12:54] ground that you have amen every man in
[1:12:57] here that's born of the spirit of god
[1:12:58] knows you have to fight for every inch
[1:13:00] of ground
[1:13:01] to tow the mark with satan isn't that
[1:13:04] right friends this is not a picnic
[1:13:06] this is a battleground we should never
[1:13:08] come here to eat cookies and so forth
[1:13:11] we're in a battle we've got to defend
[1:13:13] our god-given rights amen what god said
[1:13:16] it's ours let's stand right toe to toe
[1:13:18] with satan they're ours we believe them
[1:13:21] you might as well move back because you
[1:13:23] haven't got nothing at all
[1:13:25] satan hasn't got one legal rights of
[1:13:28] anything
[1:13:28] everything he's got is defeated and the
[1:13:31] only thing is a scarecrow
[1:13:34] amen he cannot bother you
[1:13:36] a man that's born of the spirit there's
[1:13:38] nothing at all that can harm him
[1:13:40] [Music]
[1:13:42] the bible says in isaiah 54 17 that no
[1:13:44] weapon formed against you shall prosper
[1:13:47] and every tongue that shall raise up
[1:13:48] against the v in judgment thou shalt
[1:13:50] condemn
[1:13:52] now let's close with this
[1:13:54] when god
[1:13:57] shed his blood on calvary the prophet
[1:13:59] says
[1:14:00] jesus christ in a deposit box at calgary
[1:14:03] to heal all men of sickness and disease
[1:14:06] we draw in closing now with this
[1:14:08] checkbook

[1:14:12] signatories
[1:14:14] right

[1:14:16] manager
[1:14:17] and you'll have another person the
[1:14:19] dealer principal in my case
[1:14:21] will have two signatories at any work in
[1:14:23] your environment

[1:14:28] there's accountability
[1:14:30] so he's saying that jesus signed his
[1:14:32] part with his blood
[1:14:34] and he left the other part for you to
[1:14:36] sign yes
[1:14:38] he says anything that was included in
[1:14:40] the atonement is the personal property
[1:14:42] of every believer
[1:14:46] so don't wander around like you have and
[1:14:48] you own nothing

[1:14:54] victory just believe with all your heart
[1:14:57] that god is going to pour the holy
[1:14:59] spirit upon you now amen

[1:15:53] make a decision for anything that you
[1:15:55] confess he's done it's all yours the
[1:15:57] checkbook is in your brother's hand

[1:22:15] hallelujah now knight comes
[1:22:18] he knocks the opponent out in the
[1:22:19] seventh round
[1:22:21] and you know the wife is very nervous
[1:22:23] around this time most wives don't even
[1:22:25] watch the fight
[1:22:27] they try to preoccupy their mind with
[1:22:29] other stuff
[1:22:31] if she knits she'll be knitting during
[1:22:33] that time because she doesn't want to
[1:22:34] see her husband being hit taking those
[1:22:37] punches
[1:22:38] so it's a very nervous time for the wife
[1:22:42] so at the end of it when the husband
[1:22:43] comes home
[1:22:45] maybe a few bruises
[1:22:47] bumps
[1:22:49] he's coming back home and he tells honey
[1:22:53] i am the champion
[1:22:55] i am the undisputed
[1:22:57] heavyweight
[1:22:59] champion
[1:23:01] i am the conqueror
[1:23:04] she says no did you really win the fight
[1:23:07] look honey
[1:23:08] 20 million dollars
[1:23:12] and then he takes the check
[1:23:14] and he gives it to her
[1:23:16] and he says bent this check
[1:23:18] this will secure our future
[1:23:20] then she becomes
[1:23:22] more than a conqueror
[1:23:24] she didn't wake up four o'clock in the
[1:23:26] morning to train
[1:23:28] hello
[1:23:29] she didn't spa
[1:23:32] she didn't have to take those punches
[1:23:34] she didn't have to train
[1:23:36] she didn't have to study the opponent
[1:23:38] amen but she is more than a conqueror
[1:23:41] and that's what it's like jesus christ
[1:23:43] defeated the enemy at calvary
[1:23:48] amen hallelujah and the only person that
[1:23:52] is equal to jesus christ is the bride of
[1:23:56] jesus christ
[1:23:56] [Music]
[1:23:58] she is born of his bone flesh of his
[1:24:00] flesh these two have become one
[1:24:03] amen and the bible says to him that
[1:24:05] overcomes i am going to grant that you
[1:24:07] sit at my
[1:24:09] on my throne
[1:24:10] king
[1:24:11] was a conqueror in his time you read
[1:24:13] about the provinces he ruled over but
[1:24:15] esther was more than a conqueror
[1:24:17] she comes in the end of the chapter then
[1:24:19] he says hey you're off my kingdom i'll
[1:24:20] give you
[1:24:22] you see what a woman can do
[1:24:24] make you surrender off your kingdom
[1:24:26] but that's what god has done for us
[1:24:29] even to off the kingdom he's given us
[1:24:32] don't be afraid to ask
[1:24:33] amen hallelujah
[1:24:38] now revelation 5 is a good picture
[1:24:41] of this victory
[1:24:42] he's victorious
[1:24:44] he's complaining he's the mighty
[1:24:45] conqueror now he's taking the book no
[1:24:48] one is found worthy
[1:24:50] do you know what they say when a search
[1:24:51] was made through heaven and earth they
[1:24:53] even looked at you
[1:24:54] and you were not worthy
[1:24:57] amen you are not worthy
[1:25:00] but here is the one that's coming now
[1:25:02] and he takes the book he's the one found
[1:25:03] worthy and then in revelation 10 he is
[1:25:06] bringing the book back down to the earth
[1:25:08] what is he doing the mighty conqueror is
[1:25:10] bringing the check down
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:13] and he's giving it to who john the type
[1:25:15] of the right he's giving it to the one
[1:25:17] who is more than a conqueror
[1:25:20] amen hallelujah
[1:25:23] the bible says male and female created
[1:25:25] in them so the son of god held a mystery
[1:25:27] and locked up in him with the wife of
[1:25:29] jesus christ amen so you'll notice in
[1:25:32] heaven john is the type of the bride
[1:25:34] he's not worthy
[1:25:36] but on earth the same john
[1:25:39] he is now worthy to take the book
[1:25:42] amen hallelujah
[1:25:44] the book of redemption in the book has
[1:25:46] the lamb section which has all the names
[1:25:49] of the predestinated believers on earth
[1:25:51] now when the book is given to john these
[1:25:54] names must be reproduced on the earth
[1:25:57] manifested on the earth and must come
[1:25:59] through a bedding ground it needs a
[1:26:01] woman
[1:26:03] a man to sow that seed into so john is
[1:26:06] asked to take the book and eat it amen
[1:26:08] hallelujah and
[1:26:10] satan the accuser of the brethren wants
[1:26:12] to know why you're giving him the book
[1:26:16] amen
[1:26:17] because the one who redeemed us he's
[1:26:19] also our advocate
[1:26:21] he's fighting on our behalf
[1:26:23] amen and he tells the judge he accuses
[1:26:26] us
[1:26:27] they are not wisely to take the book
[1:26:29] but the judge is looking at the case
[1:26:31] he's looking at all the evidence and
[1:26:33] he's saying but i can't find any fault
[1:26:35] in this bride
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:38] hallelujah because he is looking through
[1:26:41] something this devil is not looking at
[1:26:44] amen but satan accused of the brethren
[1:26:46] he's coming with his rebuttal arguments
[1:26:49] amen
[1:26:50] and he's asking for an appeal to his
[1:26:52] case
[1:26:54] and and god is telling satan i don't see
[1:26:57] your argument
[1:26:58] i don't see the evidence that you are
[1:27:00] presenting
[1:27:01] amen the supreme judge cannot find any
[1:27:05] truth in the evidence that satan is
[1:27:07] presenting
[1:27:08] and satan is appealing the case saying
[1:27:11] amen if you didn't apply the law
[1:27:13] correctly isn't that one of the
[1:27:15] arguments to use brother joshua i think
[1:27:17] there was an error in judgment you
[1:27:18] didn't apply the law correctly i want to
[1:27:20] appeal the case
