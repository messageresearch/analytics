[0:47] praise the Lord amen let's turn to our
[0:51] Bibles so we'll be taking communion
[0:53] tonight and due to the water outage we
[0:56] won't be able to do the second part amen
[0:59] so we'll just
[1:00] communion amen praise the
[1:03] Lord Ephesians 1 and: 7
[1:10] says I'll read from verse six to the
[1:12] praise of the glory of his
[1:15] grace Amen to the praise of the glory of
[1:19] his grace wherein he had made us
[1:22] accepted in the
[1:24] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[1:27] through his blood the forgiveness of
[1:30] sins according to the riches of his
[1:33] grace amen so what are the riches of his
[1:37] grace amen we all want to know what is
[1:42] the riches of his grace amen let's turn
[1:44] to Zechariah Chapter 4 amen praise the
[1:47] Lord I encourage you to carry your
[1:49] Bibles amen you shouldn't be coming to
[1:51] church without your
[1:53] sword
[1:56] Hallelujah every Christian ought to be
[1:58] reading the word of God
[2:01] carry your Bibles
[2:03] amen it says here we'll read Zechariah
[2:06] Chapter
[2:07] 4 Verse 6 then he answered and spake
[2:10] unto me saying this is the word of the
[2:13] Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might
[2:17] nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the
[2:20] Lord of
[2:22] hosts who are thou oh great Mountain
[2:25] before zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[2:28] plain and he shall bring forth The
[2:31] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[2:34] Grace Grace unto it amen amen so when is
[2:39] double Grace coming down at the time of
[2:41] The
[2:42] Headstone amen praise the Lord moreover
[2:45] the word of the Lord came unto me saying
[2:47] the hands of zerubabel have laid the
[2:49] foundation of this house his hands shall
[2:51] also finish it and thou shalt know that
[2:54] the Lord of hosts had sent me unto you
[2:57] amen for who had despised the day of
[2:59] small all things for they shall rejoice
[3:01] and shall see the plummet in the hands
[3:03] of zerubabel with those seven these are
[3:07] the eyes of the Lord which run to and
[3:09] fro through the whole earth amen the
[3:12] Lord had blessings to the reading of his
[3:14] word you may be
[3:15] seated
[3:18] hallelujah
[3:22] amen amen so we as the body of Christ we
[3:26] are living in a very crucial hour amen
[3:29] it's the closing years of our Earthly
[3:35] existence amen so we are to be mindful
[3:38] of
[3:40] that and sometimes it seems like we are
[3:43] living dual lives amen it seems like we
[3:47] are reminded of the Spiritual Beings
[3:50] that we ought to be maybe when we come
[3:52] to
[3:53] church but in the rest of our lives we
[3:56] are so caught up in the carnality of
[3:58] things am amen that sometimes we just
[4:01] get caught up because those are our
[4:03] duties but then we get caugh so caught
[4:05] up in it that sometimes we may even
[4:07] forget what our true purpose on the
[4:09] earth is what we are called for amen and
[4:13] that's what the Lan spirit will do
[4:15] that's right amen now we know that we
[4:19] come to church we especially to the
[4:20] message church because of one thing to
[4:25] prepare us for the Rapture amen how many
[4:28] if you can say Amen to that amen we
[4:30] didn't come here because we want a
[4:31] better house a better car a better this
[4:33] and a better that if you study hard
[4:36] enough you work hard enough the law on
[4:38] the earth is what you sow you're going
[4:40] to reap if you are too lazy and you're
[4:42] not getting what you ought to be getting
[4:44] in this life that's on you because God
[4:47] had put a law on the earth amen as a man
[4:50] Seth that shall he reap amen if you s
[4:54] sparingly you're going to reap sparingly
[4:56] so let's not confuse amen those things
[5:00] with the
[5:00] gospel there's something that stands out
[5:03] about the message of the hour and that
[5:05] is the preparation for the Rapture
[5:07] preparation for a body change and that's
[5:09] what the whole Seven Seals was about to
[5:12] come to give us rapturing
[5:14] Faith amen I think that needs to be said
[5:18] more because sometimes people get caught
[5:21] up in the blessings and the thing I need
[5:23] to go to church because of the
[5:25] blessings amen not realizing that
[5:28] blessings follow you
[5:30] amen because you are the seed of God in
[5:32] this time amen you are like Abraham
[5:34] Abraham never went chasing
[5:36] blessings and you are the Seed of
[5:39] Abraham amen so realize that and you
[5:41] won't be in lack know that you are the
[5:44] Seed of Abraham amen amen and I if you
[5:47] know what that when the Lord is telling
[5:49] Abra here in Genesis he's telling you
[5:51] that the seed of the woman shall bruise
[5:53] the Serpent's head he is talking about a
[5:56] spiritual seed coming so even though
[5:59] there were natural seeds of Abraham like
[6:02] Isaac Jacob and Joseph and all of these
[6:04] seeds they were not what God was talking
[6:07] about amen the seed that was to come
[6:10] that was going to bruise the Serpent's
[6:11] head was our Lord Jesus
[6:14] Christ amen but I'm asking you how did
[6:17] the seed
[6:18] progress because our lord Jesus said I
[6:21] I'm showing you now he said when I go
[6:23] away I'm going to send you another
[6:28] comforter
[6:30] right so the Seed of Abraham how does it
[6:32] end up he ends up by sending his Spirit
[6:35] back to the
[6:38] Earth did Jesus say he's going to send
[6:40] another
[6:41] comforter amen he's going to lead you
[6:44] and guide you into all truth amen that's
[6:47] Bible you can say amen for that amen
[6:50] hallelujah but whose Spirit came
[6:53] back did he did he say I'll send my
[6:57] spirit oh maybe we have trinitarians
[7:00] here maybe you think it's another spirit
[7:03] amen he's sending back his Spirit upon
[7:05] the
[7:06] Earth so what am I telling you that when
[7:09] you have the Holy
[7:11] Spirit that's the
[7:14] seed that's the seed come back in spirit
[7:18] form amen hallelujah so when you become
[7:21] a carrier when you become filled with
[7:22] the Holy Ghost you are Abraham's seed
[7:26] amen so blessings follow you and all of
[7:28] these things follow you amen amen
[7:30] hallelujah but we are more concerned
[7:32] about preparing for a body change
[7:35] because what shall it profit me if I
[7:37] gain the whole world gain houses and
[7:40] lands and cars and money and all of
[7:42] these things and I lose my very own
[7:45] soul what does it profit me if I lose
[7:48] preparation for the Rapture and I don't
[7:50] have faith for a body change now if we
[7:53] don't have the faith for a body change
[7:55] that's on us because the one that was
[7:57] sent to prepare us for a body change
[8:00] give us a message for a body change has
[8:02] come and gone his message has already
[8:05] sounded there's no longer Mysteries to
[8:07] be revealed he sounded all the mysteries
[8:10] of
[8:11] God Amen Hallelujah so you'll find on
[8:14] most times it's laziness on our part
[8:17] that we don't want to get interested in
[8:19] the things of God we don't want to amen
[8:21] go and read the word of God don't want
[8:23] to read the message of the hour wherein
[8:25] lies rapturing Faith amen amen
[8:28] hallelujah so we need to shake ourselves
[8:31] out of that laziness I can't say
[8:33] spiritual laziness because you're not
[8:35] spiritual not you now I'm talking about
[8:37] the person that it relates to right we
[8:40] can't call it spiritual laziness because
[8:42] you're not spiritual amen it's carnality
[8:45] and laziness amen the ones that are
[8:48] spiritual will find Value in the word of
[8:51] God will find Value in the message of
[8:53] the
[8:54] hour amen as time progresses the message
[8:58] doesn't get stale the the voice of the
[9:00] Prophet doesn't get boring to us amen
[9:02] but the voice is a voice that is
[9:04] ordained in the Bible in the days of the
[9:06] voice of the seventh angel amen every
[9:09] time you hear that voice don't shut it
[9:11] down amen it's a voice sent like Mama
[9:14] Eagle to thunder
[9:16] out amen hallelujah amen we can't
[9:19] replace the voice amen we can't replace
[9:22] it with another teaching we can't
[9:24] replace it with another man's idea this
[9:26] voice Came From Heaven amen it's a voice
[9:29] was recorded in heaven amen his birth
[9:31] was aligned with the Stars It Was
[9:33] Written in the first Heaven amen
[9:36] hallelujah and God wrote it in this
[9:40] Bible now we know that the Bible how
[9:42] many of you know in what form the Bible
[9:45] is
[9:46] currently we know this is the word of
[9:48] God Amen but you can leave it laying
[9:51] here in written form but currently if
[9:53] you're really under the revelation of
[9:55] the hour the Bible has moved from off
[9:57] the pages of this book and it's become a
[10:00] living word amen a Living Word in a
[10:03] living people hallelujah because I am
[10:06] the embodiment of all the Bible spoke
[10:09] aboutall amen I am the representation
[10:12] Hallelujah of everything of in the groom
[10:15] form now everything the Bible prophesied
[10:18] when Jesus was standing there on the
[10:20] earth he was the Living Word he came to
[10:23] make every word live amen when it came
[10:27] regarding the law he said I have come to
[10:29] fulfill the law I have come to complete
[10:31] the law amen now everything that was
[10:34] prophesied about him became alive in
[10:36] Jesus Christ how about us in this time
[10:39] and season amen everything the Bible
[10:41] speaks about in end time people becomes
[10:43] alive in you and
[10:45] I amen praise the Lord so we are
[10:48] partakers of this Grace yes amen now we
[10:51] know amen how many if you know just shut
[10:53] it out if you know it the number
[10:55] associated with with
[10:57] Grace what is the number
[11:00] five amen praise the Lord so here the
[11:02] Bible is saying that when we come to the
[11:05] edstone there'll be shoutings of Grace
[11:08] Grace now that's double five and what's
[11:12] double
[11:15] five come on
[11:18] now double five is 10 right when when
[11:22] The Headstone is coming down and what
[11:25] happens in Revelation
[11:26] 10 amen hallelujah great is coming back
[11:30] to a people shouting of Grace is coming
[11:33] back to a
[11:34] people amen so aut it's a year of double
[11:38] Grace amen praise the
[11:41] Lord so that's scriptural prophecy there
[11:44] now amen so we are living right now in
[11:47] The Riches of his
[11:48] grace amen what is Grace God's unmit
[11:52] favor meaning we did nothing to Merit
[11:55] this what God has given us amen
[11:58] hallelujah thank you Lord and therefore
[12:01] it ought to put us in a sacredness to
[12:03] know amen that God's Grace has abounded
[12:05] to us he didn't have to do it but his
[12:08] grace was shed forth in our hearts
[12:11] am amen hallelujah now because he sent
[12:15] forth Grace to us we ought to live
[12:17] reverently soberly in this
[12:19] hour it shouldn't be a case now where
[12:22] when we he communion we try and make
[12:24] things
[12:25] right amen amen hallelujah amen you
[12:28] think I'm good thoughts so what I'll do
[12:31] is this person I got enity I won't think
[12:33] about them I'll shut them out of my mind
[12:36] so I have all good thoughts so when the
[12:38] pastor ask do you have any ought against
[12:40] one another I'm not thinking about that
[12:42] Jes I'm only thinking on you now no amen
[12:46] the Bible says be at peace with all men
[12:49] amen hallelujah he says if you have
[12:51] ought against one another go and make
[12:53] that thing right amen even when it comes
[12:56] to the gifts of the church and all of
[12:57] these things he says before you offer
[12:59] your gift go and make yourself right
[13:02] that's
[13:03] Bible amen hallelujah and that's what a
[13:07] true born again Christian will do the
[13:09] holy spirit will be grieved if you if
[13:11] you know you got something against
[13:13] somebody and then you know the holy
[13:15] spirit is not an hypocrite but the Holy
[13:18] Spirit within you will say why don't you
[13:20] rather forgive why don't you rather
[13:22] love amen so praise the Lord so we're
[13:25] coming now to that time where we are
[13:28] being built up
[13:30] amen being built up into that statue of
[13:33] a perfect man because that's the man
[13:35] that's going in the Rapture yes amen
[13:39] hallelujah and the shoutings of Grace
[13:44] Grace amen his unmar favor Upon Us amen
[13:49] amen a double Grace why at this time is
[13:52] it coming in double
[13:53] portions amen amen it's coming in a
[13:57] double portion to you and I
[14:00] yes I don't know about you but I need a
[14:03] double Grace in this time Hallelujah I
[14:05] need a double Grace in the latest age
[14:08] Amen in the midst of gross darkness that
[14:10] when God threw it up in the skies it was
[14:12] completely blacked
[14:15] out who would say they don't need double
[14:17] Grace in a time like
[14:19] that but yet when the prophet drew it he
[14:21] said I drew a little light in there
[14:23] because I knew that there's going to
[14:25] come forth a bride amen amen a people
[14:28] will shine for their light amen the
[14:31] Bible says arise and shine for thy light
[14:33] has come and the glory of the Lord is
[14:36] risen up upon
[14:38] you how many if you can see the glory of
[14:40] God in your life amen how many if you
[14:42] can see the grace of God in your life
[14:45] hallelujah amen we ought to be
[14:46] testifying to the grace of God on our
[14:48] lives thank you brother Sam amen because
[14:51] he walks with us he talks with us amen
[14:54] hallelujah in the time when Satan is
[14:57] bringing condemnation and he's bringing
[14:59] fear and he's bringing amen trying to
[15:01] tell you that you are not worth it you
[15:03] are not worthy amen you say Lord your
[15:06] grace is sufficient for me Lord your
[15:09] grace is sufficient for me hallelujah
[15:13] amen because it's not what I have done I
[15:16] didn't go and redeem myself am I
[15:18] couldn't redeem myself but the blood of
[15:22] Jesus that's what Ephesians 1 year is
[15:24] telling
[15:25] us in whom we have Redemption through
[15:28] his blood
[15:31] amen amen the Forgiveness of sins
[15:35] according to the riches of his
[15:38] grace so we don't have forgiveness of
[15:40] sins from an Earthly
[15:43] judge so the forgiveness is not
[15:45] conditional the Forgiveness he takes
[15:48] your sins and he puts it in the sea of
[15:50] forgetfulness amen
[15:54] amen people think oh I've done such a
[15:56] great thing such a bad thing such a this
[15:58] and that
[15:59] I want to put a scripture in your mind
[16:02] and the Bible says that all manner of
[16:04] sin will be forgiven except if you
[16:08] blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[16:11] hallelujah amen if you blaspheme the
[16:14] Holy Ghost so I ask you what sin are you
[16:17] talking
[16:19] about what sin doesn't the blood take
[16:22] care of
[16:23] yes what sin have you committed in your
[16:26] life have you done in your life that the
[16:28] blood doesn't cover
[16:30] name it I'll give you a
[16:35] minute
[16:37] nobody the blood of Jesus covers all sin
[16:42] so when we are talking about redemption
[16:44] in which says here in whom we have
[16:46] Redemption through his
[16:49] blood I want you to get it in your mind
[16:52] that Redemption is not just relating to
[16:57] salvation salvation is just a part of
[17:00] it but the real revelation of redemption
[17:03] is I am going back to my original
[17:08] being amen the general gospel being
[17:11] preached is that Jesus Christ came to
[17:13] offer a Salvation he came to save us
[17:16] from our sins amen part truth part truth
[17:22] but Redemption means that you go back
[17:24] all the way back to what you fell
[17:27] from Hallelujah people don't like that
[17:31] yeah people want God to do everything
[17:33] amen hallelujah it's it's in the nature
[17:36] of man Fallen man to go and bow down to
[17:38] an image and to an idol
[17:45] yes they're wanting some Supernatural
[17:49] assistance but God has you you know what
[17:53] Supernatural assistance is coming from
[17:56] where from a man who recognizes his
[17:58] position yes from a man who's filled
[18:01] with the holy ghost from a man who is
[18:03] groaning the Bible says groaning within
[18:07] themselves waiting for the adoption of
[18:10] children amen hallelujah you can keep
[18:13] coming to the good old priest and saying
[18:15] bless me bless me bless me amen that is
[18:19] traditional but when you start to
[18:21] recognize who you are Hallelujah am you
[18:24] know the prophet was in discernment many
[18:26] of times yes and he would call people by
[18:28] the names and he would call this names
[18:33] addresses there was one
[18:36] time that he was
[18:38] not aware of name address where he was
[18:42] what was
[18:45] happening in fact the person that was
[18:49] operating the gift knew
[18:53] him was waiting at the gate for
[18:56] him some of you look confused
[19:02] the woman who stopped the
[19:03] plane
[19:05] Anda the prophet didn't see a vision
[19:08] didn't even know about her he thought
[19:10] the plane grounded because of whatever
[19:12] reason and the Lord told him
[19:15] walk Hallelujah but the woman standing
[19:18] at the gate knew
[19:21] him she was able to recognize
[19:24] Elijah she said I am the shunamite woman
[19:28] amen amen than you Lord where is your
[19:33] Elijah now how many of
[19:36] us if we speak a word like that can wait
[19:39] at the gate to see the Promise come to
[19:44] pass she spoke the
[19:48] word but she waited there am what
[19:52] happened if she had gone to just a
[19:55] normal
[19:57] chores
[19:59] I'm asking you what caliber of woman was
[20:01] this that was able to speak the word and
[20:04] wait at the gate to see it
[20:09] fulfilled when you speak a word do you
[20:11] walk away or do you wait that to see it
[20:15] fulfilled she waited at the gate we
[20:18] don't know how many hours because God
[20:20] let to ground the plane tell his Prophet
[20:23] to walk amen hallelujah his Prophet is
[20:27] walking and as he's walking walking by
[20:29] he sees this woman standing there and
[20:32] she says good morning
[20:34] Pastor hallelujah what faith is able to
[20:37] operate
[20:38] that
[20:40] amen when Jesus is talking about great
[20:43] faith like the centurion's faith I want
[20:46] you to see something here
[20:48] now Jesus is the Living Word yes Jesus
[20:52] is the word made
[20:53] flesh John 1 in the beginning was the
[20:56] word everybody agreed yes there was no
[20:59] one more powerful than
[21:00] Jesus how many of you
[21:04] agree Jesus is telling the Centurion I'm
[21:08] going to come to your
[21:10] house this man understanding The
[21:14] Authority you remember the last time I
[21:16] was telling you you all the legal
[21:18] authority Jesus The Living Word told him
[21:21] I'll come to your house who changed
[21:26] it who dares speak to the Living Word
[21:29] and change
[21:31] him and say no I am a man of authority I
[21:36] say to one go and he
[21:39] goes
[21:41] amen he changed Jesus
[21:45] words and he said you speak the word and
[21:49] my servant will be
[21:52] healed you carry a power within you you
[21:56] carry a legal Authority within you
[21:59] amen now think about it would you have
[22:02] told Jesus
[22:04] that but Jesus said I've never seen such
[22:06] a great
[22:07] faith able to speak to the Living
[22:10] Word and change what he
[22:15] said what measure of faith is that amen
[22:18] amen hallelujah but we are coming now to
[22:21] a greater dimension of Faith yes as we
[22:24] are understanding ourselves and as we
[22:26] are understanding what we are called for
[22:28] in this time and season we are coming to
[22:30] a greater level of

[30:39] find a way to Speak Life to them tell
[30:42] them about Jesus tell them about amen
[30:44] what God's doing in the end
[30:47] time you know I was talking to one of
[30:49] the salesman at
[30:52] work and he's
[30:56] a not a Christian is a Hindu amen and he
[31:00] was telling me you believe in
[31:02] reincarnation so I to a very interesting
[31:05] subject you going into
[31:10] now I said no I don't believe in
[31:13] reincarnation I said because then I
[31:16] started to take him through life animal
[31:18] life plant life and I said what's the
[31:21] highest form of
[31:23] life and you could see what I was
[31:25] getting he says man I said yes man is
[31:27] the the highest form of life man can
[31:30] think man can create man what what is it
[31:32] about man why is man so unique from the
[31:34] Animal
[31:38] Kingdom and I said why would you want to
[31:42] come back in a lower form I said if God
[31:45] is going to do anything he'll bring you
[31:47] back in a better form in a better
[31:49] condition he said what do you mean then
[31:52] when he said what do you mean it opened
[31:53] up a way for me for me to sh original
[31:56] man amen
[31:58] how Man was created how he's a God man
[32:01] this man is
[32:02] like he never heard this before
[32:06] denominations don't know about a God man
[32:08] a man who could speak to winds man who
[32:10] could speak to the
[32:12] waves I said this is what happened then
[32:15] I told him what happened in the Garden
[32:16] of Eden and how man fell he said it's
[32:19] impossible for us to go back I said no
[32:21] it's not impossible that is why Jesus
[32:23] Christ
[32:26] came you see when I presented the gospel
[32:29] this way he didn't because generally the
[32:32] gospel is presented in he Jesus Christ
[32:34] came to save us for our sin do you know
[32:36] you're a sinner you know you're a sinner
[32:38] that guy is thinking I'm not a sinner
[32:40] why you talking about Sin you know sin
[32:42] only becomes sin when you know the
[32:45] truth just like how the children of
[32:47] Israel prior to them having the law they
[32:49] didn't know what they're doing was wrong
[32:51] but when God gave the law then it became
[32:53] wrong so sin only becomes sin when you
[32:55] know the
[32:56] truth
[32:59] so I didn't present it to him that Jesus
[33:01] Christ came to save you from your sins I
[33:03] told him Jesus Christ to came to redeem
[33:05] us back to our original
[33:08] condition and you could see he never
[33:10] heard the gospel in this way
[33:12] before cuz he from his mouth said it's
[33:14] hour we're going to go back and that's
[33:16] when I presented Jesus to him I said
[33:18] Jesus came to take us back to that
[33:20] condition and I said when I die I'm
[33:22] going into a better body I'm going into
[33:24] a better State not never to die I said
[33:27] man was not created to die so you
[33:29] talking about dying and coming back in
[33:31] another form man was never created to
[33:35] die we've got to preach the gospel of
[33:38] redemption that's the gospel of the
[33:40] Kingdom because man fell from the
[33:42] kingdom in Eden man must be restored
[33:44] back to the kingdom that's what the
[33:46] three-fold purpose is to restore the
[33:49] kingdom thank you let's not lose sight
[33:51] of that amen that's just a little word
[33:53] of encouragement let's give the Lord a
[33:54] good an clap of Praise amen he's worthy
[33:56] of praise
[33:58] double Grace amen double Grace come upon
[34:02] US carriers of
[34:06] Grace if people want to see
[34:08] personification of Grace they must look
[34:11] at us now I want to leave you with a
[34:13] thought if God if no matter what we did
[34:16] God gave us double Grace how can we not
[34:19] be gracious to
[34:20] others how can we not extend Grace to
[34:23] others amen we are carries of Grace the
[34:26] only love the only Grace people will see
[34:28] through you and I amen so let's just not
[34:32] amen always offer up harsh words but
[34:35] always
[34:37] Grace as much as I receive I give out
[34:41] amen I receive Grace I'm pushing out in
[34:44] multiplication amen that's the gospel of
[34:46] the Kingdom amen hallelujah it is better
[34:50] to give than to receive Hallelujah let's
[34:53] all stand together as we read a portion
[34:55] of scripture amen we go into the
[34:57] communion if we can get
[34:59] the communion wine and the bread
[35:09] Hallelujah 1 Corinthians chapter
[35:11] 11 praise the
[35:26] Lord
[35:39] so the Bible reads from verse 23 for I
[35:42] have received of the Lord that which
[35:46] also I delivered unto
[35:50] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[35:52] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[35:55] when he had given thanks he break it and
[35:57] said take eat this is my body which is
[36:01] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[36:04] me so part of why we do the communion
[36:08] take the body the bread represents the
[36:10] body we remembering our Lord we are
[36:14] remembering our Messiah amen our Lord
[36:17] Jesus
[36:21] Christ after the same manner also he
[36:24] took the cup and when he had slept
[36:26] saying this cup is the New Testament New
[36:30] Testament means New Covenant in my blood
[36:34] this do he as of as he drink it in
[36:37] remembrance of
[36:39] me for as of often as you eat this bread
[36:43] and drink this cup you do show the
[36:46] Lord's death till he
[36:50] come now that coming is not talking
[36:53] about a spiritual
[36:55] coming he says tell till he come there
[36:59] are some people who have stopped taking
[37:01] communion because they believe that the
[37:04] Lord came we know he came in the word
[37:07] coming amen but Jesus he says what did
[37:11] he
[37:13] say for as often as you eat so this is
[37:17] the Apostle Paul speaking this if you go
[37:19] and read Jesus speaking he says I will
[37:21] take it and you with you in my
[37:26] kingdom I'm going to take take it with
[37:27] you again in my kingdom when is
[37:31] that at the completion of the second
[37:33] coming when we go to the married supper
[37:35] of the Lamb amen
[37:39] hallelujah so we want to see a physical
[37:41] Lord
[37:43] Jesus amen we want to see a physical
[37:46] Lord
[37:48] Jesus how many of you can say Amen to
[37:51] that amen
[37:53] because Jesus Christ has a glorified
[37:56] body and when we see him we shall be
[37:59] like him we shall be glorified like him
[38:01] amen hallelujah so we are doing this in
[38:04] remembrance of him amen praise the Lord
[38:07] I just want to say
