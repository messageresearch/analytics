principles of the Bible right amen what they are reaping now is what they sowed they're reaping it now didn't you see it in your age growing up corporal punishment was banned amen they are reaping what they are sowing they are reaping a generation of James Dobson grown-ups psychological approach to the gospel yeah amen don't think this thing just came up now it's grown into a monster because it was sown in a seed form amen it's a lying spirit amen come upon people but man was made in the image of God male and female created in them yes amen amen a man can never be a woman and a woman can

off YouTube okay [Music] amen hallelujah but we've got to keep the standard we are the standard bearings of light in this last days yes amen amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord you'll never get anywhere with God there if you have reasoning now but in your heart your faith will make you believe that your mind knows nothing about you see faith will make you believe things your mind knows nothing about faith looks to the Unseen your mind will tell you how it's impossible your faith will tell you it's possible yeah amen you cast down reasoning now he says that in this modern world even in our fallen condition that men go with machinery and dig out foul pushes and so forth and and take big blowers and blow the sand up and they put foundations down and build homes build highways they build beautiful structure what does that because inside of him is an amateur creator man has not stopped creating he's gone God permissive world but he's still a creator and even though he doesn't possess the power of the spoken what you create he takes created substances and he creates yeah yeah yes amen it takes something that's already been created and makes another creation out of it now we see the difference an animal never changes his habitat and fox still lives like he did a thousand years ago a bird still builds the same kinds of nist if fish still spawns in the sand the monkey still lives in the tree but we find animal life is primitive but man in the image of God he keeps building up amen yes amen you ought to see yourself Through The Eyes Of God amen he's not

and they gone off the sin now it's time for Sodom to burn yes yes amen yes amen that we got the next one yeah now watch what he has done the one that stayed with Abraham he gave him his side now watch what the sign was to says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man the days of Sodom was just before the world was destroyed wickedness was destroyed by fire you asked the question do you believe the world will be destroyed by fire it is coming the Bible said so amen the world the whole heavens and earth would be on fire men will do it themselves because God destroys nothing he will destroy the whole world by his knowledge the tree in the garden of eat the tree in the garden that he left the Tree of Life to eat of the tree of knowledge science has been climbing ever since man destroys himself by his knowledge he's shrewdness his education always done it created gunpowder create atomic bombs automobiles that's what kills him amen the next World War won't last but a few seconds Atomic Warfare amen Hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen watch what happened there now there's a hidden Mystery right there when the angel came to Sarah and Abraham had told him you're going to have a son Sarah doubted in a heart learn from this now amateur gods where did she doubt did she say anything no God listens to your thoughts yes God listens to your thoughts your attitudes how you come to church everything you have about the message everything you have about his word maybe you confess one thing with you I believe the word but in your heart you don't God listens to the heart he's sitting there and Sarah doubted in the heart what's he doing negativity is being thrown into the air into the heavens by thoughts your word speaks louder in heaven then your words on Earth learn that that's why never confess a negative thing amen the reason why sickness is remaining upon you is because you're constantly confessing this thing yes amen never talk negative about your body again amen amen never talk negative about your son again yeah about your daughter again yes yes always look at the finished work amen yes and say he is healed thank the Lord for the healing thank the Lord for the Deliverance amen hallelujah there's a difference which only between facts and Truth don't focus on the fact look to the truth amen what happened Sarah was so in negativity amen she was a god of the Earth God was going to use her amateur God but she's sowing negativity thoughts are negative but yes God himself Discerning a heart what does he do he counted it straight away yes yes don't let negative thoughts lie counter it straight away amen come on now this is not just a one-soft thing amen amen when God Amen God told Sarah why did you love why did you doubt she said I didn't she said yes you did don't let negativity come into your life I'm talking about anyone never let negativity be sown into your life stop it immediately amen amen when Abraham was going to slay Isaac in the mountain God told him go sacrifice your only son that was negative to the family right why did Abraham confess I and the land will go and we will return Yes amen he changed the cause of it by his confession Hallelujah the women their son was slain in the field that day the circumstance was negative death struck the boy the boy was dead yes did she allow the negative circumstance to take control or did she confess positive all is well amen you regard yes you're a Creator amen amen amen hallelujah amen amen Blessed Be His holy name don't care about the threat of the enemy yes then they would do the same thing David is running to Goliath I like that the Bible says he ran took Goliath if you see me running I'm not running from the enemy I'm running to the enemy follow me let's slam amen amen yes it's time to check back right it's time to take back amen right now we're taking back your godship hallelujah amen right now we're taking out all unbelief

talk like a god amen David running to Goliath Goliath Jesus guy coming and he says I curse him he curses him by his Gods who read the Bible in Samuel he curses him by his gods amen hallelujah and what does David tell him amen David looks at him and he tells him amen so listen to what the Bible says here the Philistine looked about and saw David and he disdained him for he was by the youth running in a fair countenance and the Philistine said am I a dog you come to me with staves and the fullest in cursed David by his Gods negativity David would not stand for it and the fullest scene said to David come to me I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the Peace of the field and then David spoke back amen counter every negative Force amen count it culture every negative reports amen negative amen what did David say then David said to the Philistine thou cometh to me with a sword with a spear and with a shield amen he's coming with this Trinity there but I come to thee in the name one of the Lord of hosts yes amen who is the Lord of hosts what is host talking about angel Army he's the Lord of hosts I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts amen do we have the angel of the Lord present with us now the Lord of hosts is here amen amen hallelujah and the god of the armies of Israel which thou is defied watch how he speaks to him now this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand and I will smity and take that hit from offline hit amen take that hit from thee and I will give the carcass of the host of the fullest day not only you the carcass of this entire Philistine Army I am going to give it unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beast of the earth thank you amen and the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel I want her to know that there's a God here yes amen there's a God on the earth amen amen can you rise up like David David didn't have a sword but he told him I'm gonna chop your head off yeah speak to the devil speak to your circumstance you may not even have the tools at hand but speak the confession of your faith he said I'm gonna take your head off you didn't have a sword of his own he had to use Goliath's sword yeah use Goliath sworn against himself amen use the devil's tactics against himself amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen hallelujah and all this assembly shall know the Lord saveth not with sword or spear for the battle is the Lord and will give you into our hands so how did David win the battle by his confession everything David said to collide he did it amen he saw it already he saw the victory amen speak to your situation speak to your Mountain amen nothing shall be able to stand in your way amen hallelujah amen so we find sin took man out of his amateur godship when man fell the Earth fell he lost his inheritance he lost his inheritance to eternal life power over the Earth and fellowship with God yes amen brother Branham says amen that the blood put man back in position and sent sin back to Satan it's a powerful statement the blood put back man back in his position and sent sin back to Satan amen you say in the old world no in your life so I don't know why you're playing with Play-Doh you're like a baby oh I let this play the way oh so nice a secret Play-Doh so nicest drink I understand you know I want to ask you a question brother why did God put the doctor tree there why did God make the wine reasoning you see what's got your mind reasoning there's so much more glorious things in the kingdom of God than for you to stoop to that level amen you're an amateur God why are you living in Scotland amen hallelujah Winston came in we find that man crossed the chasm he couldn't go back you remember like that rich man and Lazarus saw Abraham there was a Chasm he couldn't cross it and the blood of bulls and goats covered did not remit until the real bleach came the blood of Jesus and broke the curse of sin and when its sin is confessed upon the basis of the blood of Jesus Christ it's like dropping a black of it's like dropping a black ink into a bunch of Clorox bleach it just breaks it into the chemicals and sends it plump back to where it's from and sends it back upon its original perverted that was Satan amen amen get rid of sin get rid of unbelief send it back to Satan amen many times you only focus on oh send the sickness back save return to send them how about we to turn his sin back to him yeah how about we return his Netflix back to him turn back his movies to him yes how about we return all the magazines back to him how about we return all responses back to him amen come on now amen yes amen amen you know what he says now what's the condition of the church the church is so far away from its place the church is so far below in its living standard and I think too many times we are progging instead of really coming out and facing the issue [Music] you know what that word Prague means but the brand I'm using that word Prague he says we are progging instead of really coming out and facing the issue he said we are looking for scraps to eat in the kingdom of God people are looking for scraps and a Hungry Man will eat from durbins he says that's what's wrong with the church we are progging amen instead of really coming out and facing the issue there's something wrong somewhere in the churches and I think it's a denominational system that's Twisted the people's minds it needs to be back to be sons of God again rulers governors of the earth under the spiritual Reign it will be someday when the chief one comes Jesus Christ the great Millennium nature is groaning for that day amen amen now he says denominations don't know how to do it how to get back right but we have promised that it would be revealed and now these Seven Seals that this book is sealed with seals are bringing it back come on now how long you been in the message amen are you in the message of the hour is the message in you amen how many of you have read this church age books amen happy if you have read the sales book but I'm in the message amen let's not play around I'm not here to preach or someone to you tap you on your back and send you home I'm here to prepare for the Rapture amen yes amen what did he say the way back is what the Seven Seals the opening of the word didn't we preach when to say the value effects of the message of the owl the revelation of the word come on now I know it's getting uncomfortable but we're not calling out names right now we have church age books right here yeah we have Seven Seals books right here brand new copies you can take it out to the service no one will question you start to read it amen yes he says go way back has been granted to us yes amen through the opening of the word people don't want God's way ah so boring why don't you put some lights here put some lights here to meet some music Don't Preach is what they preach about that uh there's a sea time and a Harvest Time what you saw you're gonna read I'm asking you not to sow what you're sowing right now otherwise you're going to reap something you know many times you reap our own things what we sow in our own lives yeah we saw those things but through the path you've spoken word you can cancel it now you can cancel every negative thought every negative word every generational curse every family is free of heart disease cancer high blood pressure sugar diabetes control it right now Gods yes amen amen control it right now yes amen we have promised that it would be revealed and now these Seven Seals in the book that this book is sealed with and then after the seals are complete to be fine in Revelation 10 there were seven mysterious Thunders that John was forbidden to write those and at the time of the standards we find the angel comes down with a rainbow seven pallet rainbow amen The Pride people got a six-colored rainbow what is six men right we find the angel come down with a rainbow and put his feet upon the land and see you see Revelation 9 star gave them a rainbow as well he went back to the Sprite thing you didn't tell stewards and uh you should have went and bought goods from there okay when they proudly display the sixth colored rainbow why it never take a seven color rainbow and run in the shop everywhere then why must the rights of a minority be promoted amen so we find the angel came down with a rainbow in Revelation 10. Revelation falling star gave them a six color rainbow put his feet on land and sea and swore the time had run out at that time that's the fourth seal right now what is he saying if you caught what he is saying there the seventh seals came seven Thunders out to their voices and awakened the people and showed them the way back amen amen but who awakens people amen Luke 7 verse 12 if you go there you pick up a dead man is being carried out in a funeral procession amen hallelujah the winner of name a son is dead Jesus comes upon the procession and the Lord had compassion on Earth 7 13 now and he said unto her wheat not then he came and he touched the couple the Brian Stood Still and he said young man I say unto thee all right does the bible say that death and life lies in the power of the tongue amen who is the one raising the Dead amen who is the one waking up people Amen brother you're preaching woke culture yes we are the first woke people seven Thunders awakened us amen Satan is a perverture now they got woke programs going on but the bride is already awakened amen mark chapter 5 verse 41. didn't he go to Jesus James daughter take her by the hand and say talita Kumi amen which being interpreted saying daughter I say unto thee arise amen come on now amen who is this man are we coming back in this image and likeness yes amen amen oh Hallelujah for far too long denominations have kept Jesus as something we cannot attain yeah but Jesus wants us to come in His image and he's likeness Hallelujah come on now it may be hard for you to swallow this amen but eat it amen it may be sweet in your mouth and put it in your belly amen but your amateur God yes Hallelujah amen and straightway the damself arose and walked amen John 11 11 you know Jesus says that these things he said unto them our friend lives with sleepeth but I go that I may awaken him out of sleep who is the one that awakes out of sleep amen yes amen 11 43 says when he had thus spoken cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth amen you go back to our slide there yeah you find brother Branham and then immediately the Holy Spirit spoke to me I turned from the place walk down the step come to where she was and just as I started to where she was the Holy Spirit spoke to me and I said Mary amen there's a woman that's dead if you don't catch it the prophet walks up to the woman and tells Mary and she got up yes brother Brandon yes yes I showed you I took it from Jesus and I showed you a prophet amen amen amen Hallelujah amen then brother go away drop dead in the service yeah amen it's on tape yes talking about brother Wayne how he has a nervous condition the brother gets a heart attack right there he's embarrassed he gets a heart attack right there his wife's a registered nurse there's like some commotion going on that they claim Dead Brother Brian goes to check his pulse he's dead and he called him back brother way yeah and he wakes up amen that's right amen you're an amateur God Amen yes if you say Amen what's going to wake you up who wakes you up next slide it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake up up again we can watch amen awaken you to your godship yeah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I wish you were here standing here now and see the strain in the spirit realm right now there are some who are pulling in there somewhere resisting right now I wish you were here to feel the strain that I'm under right now amen but I don't know why why wouldn't you want to raise up to your godship yes amen why would you resist the word of God yes is that thing that you're holding on to so great that you can't surrender it help us Lord yes that's what's holding you back your own lust less for that thing yeah yeah less for this Idol Aiken who my little golden witch no man can serve God in memory do you love the world and the things of the world if you love the world the things of the world the love of God is not in you amen but if you love the things of God the word of God will be in you hallelujah amen let's move now so what's waking us up in this time what awakened us oh Hallelujah and may the seventh hundreds awaken you this morning amen hallelujah amen say if you are not awakened say Lord send the seven Thunders to awaken me yes amen amen hallelujah what so we we saw what took man away from his Dominion right it was sin follow me now I do have a thought train of thought what brings us back to Dominion it's Redemption says in Leviticus 25 verse 23 you get the laws of redemption the only one way that it can be redeemed it's by a near Kinsmen the only one who can rightfully redeem it this poor man lost him if this poor man if a man got poor lost anything to another man only way it could be redeemed would be to a near Kinsman this man holds it for a certain amount of time but it must come back to the original owner Miss amen Hallelujah this is what we have in the birth of Jesus Christ thank you you'll get it now what do we have back in the birth of Jesus Christ what he said if if somebody takes something away from you It's Only Hell for a season yes until the time of Jubilee comes around amen amen amen you're gonna get it now amen yes but when Redemption comes it must go back to its original owner let me break it down for you the original thought was for Adam to reproduce himself by the spoken word amen but because of sin it went back to somebody else reproduction went to somebody else the nature of the law but what does he say here we have it back um and Joshua preaches a few weeks ago if you remember we have it back in the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ to the power of the spoken word amen no sexual act yes the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary amen amen so at the time amen didn't Jesus say this is the acceptable year of the Lord the time of Jubilee had come yes amen so the original thought of God for man to reproduce by the spoken word had to come back amen and we have it in the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ and that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ does sets a man across the chasm again so now it puts you across another chasm amen now you're across Satan can't get to you the only way that he can get to you he must be justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost amen that is your brother and then he can come to you amen but Satan hates the things of God so if Satan is your brother then you are still in his territory yes amen amen amen I don't want to go about that other one about somebody who's being your father-in-law and mother-in-law and things like that right you know the joke now watch he says here you must be positive amen and you stay there until you are positive yes so you must be positive but he's telling you if you've got a little bit doubt in that positivity stay there till you become positive amen say the word till you're positive yeah you say brother you're speaking on Mark 11 23 for long hair I'm staying in it till you are positive about it amen yes stay there until you're positive they nothing can turn you yeah amen amen if Moses under the blood of animal blood could have so much creative power in him he spoke flies we've been through these 10 plagues he spoke Waters turning into blood amen you spoke Locust he spoke leprosy he spoke boils amen under the blood of bulls and goats how much more powerful under the blood of Jesus Christ amen yes amen hallelujah amen he says God uses men God could have used mint God could have used a son to preach a gospel God could have used the wind to preach the gospel but God chose men to preach the gospel there again we're going to do some Diagnostics what's the matter with the church today there's something wrong my opinion we're not coming with the sincerity to the right thing for that for what for that that God should power we're not coming with the right sincerity if God could do that by blood of bulls and goats that only covered sin and made a propitiation for The Sinner but the sin was still there what can he do through the blood of his son that omits him amen God is Not manufactured but he has created a blood that takes away all sin and Mark 11 23 when you say to this mountain you see how he's tying it back to that scripture he's showing you how the blood puts you back there the blood puts you back as an amateur God thank you Lord Oh The Blood of Jesus don't sing about the blood brother we pass the blood the blood releases it the blood made way for Pentecost amen the blood omits sin God is Not manufactured but he created a blood that takes away sin then directly quotes Mark 11 23 whatsoever you see what whatever you say to this mountain move don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said amen where's the Pentecostal church today you don't realize that confess truly confess sin amid sin if there's no amen it builds a bridge across the chasm takes man back into the presence of his creator and makes him a Son of God Amen amen he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also amen verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved he quotes it again but believe what you have said you can have what you have said it's my God revealing himself in humility amen amen thank you Lord God takes a humbling sinner cleanses him by his blood dropping the confession into the Clorox bleach amen hallelujah we read all of that amen this is just another quote he talks about Elisha going Elijah going up dropping the Rope for Elijah he got a double portion the work that I do shall you do also and greater than Lee shall you do for I go to my father again he asked what's wrong Church yes it's a finished work amen amen now here's the answer I believe you're ready for the answer amen you've got to get away from your own thoughts yes you've got to let the mind that was in Christ be in you amen amen you've got to stay there till every sin of fear every sin of Doubt has gone from your heart amen and if you're there and God doesn't take you in admit that sin and send you into the presence of God there is something wrong with your experience God hiding himself in humility revealing himself in power that's the way God does it that's God's program of doing it yes sir that he may bring Sons across the sheasm oh thank you Lord now God's trying to bring him back God's trying to bring you back

all about waiting for the seat jump isn't you no more it's God in the man God's word watered by the Holy Spirit to produce the same thing God manifesting continuing the work of his first son his only begotten son right Christ was God's word made manifest he died and gave his life that he might send the spirit take his body up send the spirit back to water to pay the redeeming price if we believe it if you believe it he that believeth on me the words that I do then the Holy Spirit comes upon the same word of God now you say where do you throw it upon the Bible then the Bible has got to be in you the word is a seed as long as it's laying here on your shelf in your hand it won't do nothing but when it comes in here when it comes into the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit The Works of God the Visions come power comes humility comes all you're knowing is all gone you become nothing Christ becomes alive when I die he lives again when I die he promised me life and I died out to myself so in order that I can have his life and how do I do it by taking his word eat the book he's seen put his seed in there by faith and believe it and then it produces exactly what the Bible says amen amen and when he is challenged the proof he that believeth on me the works that I do in other words you will be an amateur messiah messiah for his life be in you if it ain't you it's him and you are a day to carry out his work on he that believeth on me I'll prove that I am Messiah and either believeth on me will do the same thing I'm going to close with this quote now in
