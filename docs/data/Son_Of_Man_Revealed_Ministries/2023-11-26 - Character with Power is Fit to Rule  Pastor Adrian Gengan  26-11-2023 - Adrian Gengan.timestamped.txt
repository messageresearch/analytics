[2:54] for us Lord and father we thank you Lord
[2:56] that we can come now we thank you for
[2:58] every believer that is coming to the
[2:59] house of the the Lord we pray you'll
[3:00] bless them and Lord I pray you'll meet
[3:02] the point of need this morning we ask it
[3:04] in Jesus name for much Thanksgiving amen
[3:08] amen let's give the Lord a good anle of
[3:09] Praise amen good to see everyone the
[3:13] house of the Lord amen greet your
[3:14] brother and your sister say welcome
[3:16] amen
[3:18] amen haven't seen some of you look like
[3:20] we need to have some Zoom meetings and
[3:23] whatsa video call so I can see you more
[3:25] often amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[3:32] hallelujah amen this morning we'll speak
[3:35] on character with power is foot to rule
[3:39] amen character with power is foot to
[3:41] rule amen there's certain character
[3:44] required Amen to operate certain
[3:46] scriptures amen hallelujah it's only
[3:49] locked up to certain people amen and
[3:52] it's only people that have a certain
[3:54] character like Mark 11:23 will be able
[3:57] to operate it Mark 16 even requires a
[3:59] the character because you get some
[4:01] characters who in a veiled
[4:04] way are disbelieving Mark
[4:07] 16 when I say veiled way when they tell
[4:10] you
[4:11] that healing is the part of the first
[4:13] and second pool they are basically
[4:15] telling you they're part of the old
[4:16] school that don't believe Mark 16
[4:18] because Mark 16 is not based on any
[4:20] polls Mark 16 is based on them that
[4:24] believe amen so some people as soon as
[4:27] you tell them about healing of the power
[4:30] of God they equated to first and second
[4:32] pool and they say we in the third pool
[4:34] because they are dead as a door nail
[4:37] amen hallelujah they proclaim the
[4:39] opening of the word but no power amen so
[4:42] we've got to have both Dynamics and
[4:44] mechanics amen yes any church that
[4:46] doesn't operate Mark 16 is a dead church
[4:49] amen the scriptural identification of
[4:51] the True Church of God is Mark 16 can
[4:53] you say amen amen believe that amen by
[4:55] faith amen so character with power is
[4:58] foot to rule let's turn to one samel 13
[5:00] and
[5:01] ver14 it's one portion of scripture I
[5:04] want to get you seated amen I realize
[5:06] that you've been standing amen for since
[5:09] the service started and sometimes we
[5:11] take so long to read the scriptures
[5:13] you're standing for 45 minutes we don't
[5:16] realize we have old people young people
[5:19] amen so we want to be sensitive to
[5:21] everybody amen maybe the song leaders me
[5:23] make you sit in between for one song or
[5:26] two je we got some old people here
[5:31] I was timing the some of the services
[5:32] and sometimes you're standing for 45
[5:34] minutes sometimes 50 minutes before you
[5:36] get seated amen so let's be sensitive to
[5:39] that as well 1 Samuel
[5:42] 13:14 but now thy kingdom shall not
[5:46] continue this is's not talking to
[5:50] Saul so he had a bad character right
[5:53] that's what we getting to but now the
[5:55] Lord had sought him a man after his own
[5:58] heart amen
[6:00] and the Lord had commanded him to be
[6:01] Captain over his people because thou has
[6:04] not kept that which the Lord commanded
[6:08] thee amen amen you may be seated the
[6:11] Lord bless you Lord bless his
[6:14] word
[6:16] amen amen then we'll turn to Genesis 6
[6:20] and8 just one portion of scripture
[6:23] there Genesis 6
[6:28] and8
[6:30] but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the
[6:33] Lord amen so there are specific Men Who
[6:36] Please the Lord what is it about them
[6:39] their
[6:40] character amen Hebrews
[6:43] 11:5 amen praise the Lord
[6:51] amen you can see verse 5 speaks about
[6:54] Grace and here we're dealing with no
[6:56] with Enoch it says by faith Enoch was
[6:59] translated that he should not see death
[7:02] and was found not because God had
[7:04] translated him for before his
[7:07] translation he had this
[7:09] testimony amen that he pleased God amen
[7:13] amen amen what a testimony to have amen
[7:17] that we are pleasing the Lord amen
[7:20] hallelujah and this testimony was not
[7:22] man's testimony yes the testimony that
[7:25] he had was God's testimony about his son
[7:28] Enoch amen man and Enoch the Lord didn't
[7:32] tell him you're going to go in the ark
[7:34] the Lord had reserved him to be
[7:35] translated amen amen so what kind of
[7:38] character did these men possess amen
[7:41] because we are coming now into a time in
[7:42] a season where there must be a certain
[7:45] character on display amen amen God the
[7:49] only person that's going to be raptured
[7:51] is Jesus
[7:54] amen he's the only one that qualifies
[7:57] for the
[7:58] rapture so we must be like
[8:01] Jesus amen and that is what the fivefold
[8:04] ministry is doing if you read Ephesians
[8:05] 4 it's telling you that the five for
[8:07] Ministry is designed to bring you into
[8:09] the image of Jesus Christ amen everybody
[8:12] agree amen uh we'll read just now in
[8:14] second Peter what their true character
[8:16] is amen praise the Lord so if we're
[8:18] looking at and we're starting there at
[8:20] Saul and David we can see the type of
[8:23] character that men choose by their
[8:25] natural eyes yes
[8:28] amen look look at what they chose and
[8:30] then look at what Israel chose amen they
[8:32] chose a man that was Head and Shoulders
[8:34] above any man in the nation he was great
[8:38] big fine handsome
[8:40] looking amen but the prophet says he was
[8:43] always a fly in the
[8:44] ointment amen but God says I'm going to
[8:47] choose you a king of my own choosing
[8:50] amen amen I want you before you get lost
[8:53] in the sermon to know that God has
[8:55] specifically chosen you because you are
[8:57] a son and daughter of character you
[8:59] possess qualities within you that God
[9:01] won't find
[9:02] elsewhere amen God predestinated you
[9:06] like that do you know God hates people
[9:08] and loves people before they are born
[9:10] amen hallelujah Jacob have I loved Esau
[9:13] have I hated amen so God Loved You amen
[9:16] and we ought to appreciate God for
[9:18] loving us in such a way thank you Lord
[9:21] amen hallelujah
[9:22] amen
[9:24] so he tells Samuel to go to Jesse's
[9:28] house and he say I'm not going to tell
[9:29] you who he is but you go up there he is
[9:32] one of Jesse's Sons amen so Jesse and
[9:36] his wife probably looked around and they
[9:38] presented the oldest son he was great
[9:40] tall handsome the prophet would say he
[9:42] looked just right for a king's crown
[9:45] he's smart educated a fine man I know
[9:47] you'll be right he speaks his words
[9:49] proper but when they brought him out and
[9:52] Samuel took the cruise of all and went
[9:53] towards him he says no the Lord has
[9:56] refused him so he went all all the way
[9:59] down through the Suns and then he says
[10:01] isn't there another yes amen hallelujah
[10:06] isn't there
[10:08] another and then when we find he says
[10:10] yes is's one he's out in the back
[10:12] hurting sheep he's back there and he
[10:14] plays songs he sings it he shouts and
[10:16] goes on Amen some real Pentecostal
[10:19] experience amen not some dead beat amen
[10:22] but somebody who has the life of Christ
[10:24] within him amen somebody who has the
[10:26] holy ghost
[10:28] power yes thank you amen how many if you
[10:31] know the prophet says the Holy Ghost
[10:33] want behave himself in one person this
[10:35] way and misbehave himself in another
[10:37] person that way so if the Holy Ghost is
[10:39] full of power the Holy Ghost is full of
[10:41] action amen ask yourself amen I can't
[10:44] stay silent in the house of the
[10:46] Lord amen hallelujah you know the
[10:49] kingdom of God suffered violence and the
[10:51] violence taken by force the kingdom of
[10:53] God is the Holy Ghost amen and you must
[10:55] take the Holy Ghost by force because
[10:57] there are spirits that are not willing
[10:59] for you to be baptized with the Holy
[11:01] Ghost amen but it's your inheritance the
[11:04] Holy Ghost is your inheritance
[11:08] amen so how would God take somebody who
[11:11] was born in sin shaped in iniquity came
[11:13] into this world speaking lies amen
[11:15] nothing good about ourselves how will he
[11:17] take us and equip us and get us ready
[11:19] for a Rapture body change how will he do
[11:23] it amen to make us Sons and Daughters of
[11:25] God I'm going to make this statement
[11:26] that God started the church in act in
[11:29] the book of Acts the way he wanted it to
[11:31] amen but now he wants to go he wants the
[11:35] church to go back to the way he started
[11:37] it I'll say it again God started the
[11:39] church in the book of Acts the way he
[11:41] wanted it now he wants the church to go
[11:43] back to the way he started it am amen
[11:47] I'm going to further that thought by
[11:48] telling you that God created Man In His
[11:51] Image in Genesis 1 yes the way you
[11:54] wanted man to be created now you want
[11:57] man to go back to the that original
[11:59] image the way God created and intended
[12:01] him to be this may seem like a foreign
[12:04] thought to the world but it shouldn't be
[12:05] a foreign thought here in the church
[12:07] that we are going back to our Godlike
[12:09] position where we shall have dominion
[12:11] and power over the Earth yes amen amen
[12:16] amen it may seem foreign to people that
[12:19] they can command things and it happens
[12:21] but yes it is
[12:23] so amen hallelujah praise the Lord and
[12:27] I'm so excited to be acquainted with
[12:29] sons and daughters of God who possess a
[12:31] Godlike character a Christlike character
[12:34] who is able to operate in the god-given
[12:36] abilities in this
[12:38] hour amen hallelujah I I'm privileged to
[12:41] walk beside you as Sons and Daughters of
[12:44] God amen amen who's going to defy
[12:47] gravity who's going to defy the powers
[12:50] of this world Amen Satan has come to
[12:52] clog man with unbelief and take away his
[12:55] true identity that he's a god of the
[12:57] Earth
[13:00] God created us to be a god of the Earth
[13:02] but Satan came and dimmed the eyes of
[13:03] the
[13:05] people amen but God is Reawakening his
[13:08] people to the what he created them for
[13:11] amen hallelujah so this boy that was out
[13:14] there was hurting sheep he was playing
[13:16] songs he was shouting amen every once
[13:18] and again he shouted
[13:20] hallelujah praise the
[13:23] Lord amen and he was operating with
[13:25] sling and stone amen hallelujah David
[13:29] was operating with sling and stone both
[13:31] the Dynamics and the mechanics amen
[13:34] hallelujah praise the lord we got too
[13:36] many people operating with stone
[13:38] alone amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[13:42] yes but it required both sling and stone
[13:45] that's what people have been doing
[13:46] Through The Years amen under the
[13:48] Vindicated message of the hour they have
[13:50] been operating with stone alone and
[13:51] they've been stoning people that's why
[13:53] the word of God couldn't penetrate the
[13:55] hearts of the people they were not using
[13:57] the sling with the stone
[13:59] David didn't take the stone and start to
[14:01] Stone Goliath it wouldn't have had the
[14:04] effect but he needed the sling amen some
[14:07] of you know what I'm talking about
[14:08] because you were part of them that were
[14:09] stoning
[14:13] people amen hallelujah it's not the way
[14:16] to present the gospel just beat people
[14:18] of the word but how about we apply a
[14:19] little spirit with it and amen the
[14:21] spirit can soften the hearts of people
[14:26] amen amen let him that is without sin
[14:29] cast the first stone amen hallelujah
[14:32] amen praise the
[14:34] Lord so we find that
[14:37] when when they bring s David out to the
[14:40] prophet and then the prophet can anoint
[14:43] him with the oil and he poured it on his
[14:45] head and said this is God's
[14:47] chosen amen not pretty but character God
[14:50] looks at character turn to your neighbor
[14:52] and say I am chosen I am chosen tell him
[14:55] you are chosen you are chosen amen
[14:57] praise the Lord amen so God is featured
[15:00] in character we know that the Bible says
[15:03] that there was no Beauty in Jesus that
[15:05] we should desire him amen
[15:08] hallelujah praise the Lord you find all
[15:11] my thoughts are coming from the
[15:12] prophet's message amen hallelujah amen
[15:15] praise the Lord there's no Beauty in
[15:18] Jesus that we should desire him but
[15:20] there was never a character like him on
[15:22] the
[15:23] earth Hallelujah and if we in His image
[15:25] and in his likeness if we are being
[15:27] built up in His image there's not a
[15:29] character like us there's not a woman
[15:32] like this on the earth there's not a
[15:34] bride like this on the earth amen you
[15:36] are royal priesthood a holy nation amen
[15:39] set apart for
[15:41] God Amen Hallelujah we know this famous
[15:44] saying amen that the beauty of the
[15:46] church is the character of the people if
[15:50] you're are looking for the beauty of the
[15:52] church we got to look at the character
[15:53] of the people and I'm thankful for
[15:55] sisters here that can amen identify
[15:58] themselves as as Daughters of God and be
[16:00] able to take the scripture and apply the
[16:02] word to their heart and conform to the
[16:04] standard of the word because it's not a
[16:06] popular standard but it is God's
[16:08] standard amen amen I'm thankful for men
[16:11] in the church that are able to submit
[16:13] themselves under the authority of the
[16:15] word because it is God's standard amen
[16:18] hallelujah we are not wishy-washy
[16:20] Christians amen hallelujah because Satan
[16:24] and his group looks for big beautiful
[16:26] churches amen Hal Hallelujah beautiful
[16:29] things that's what the world looks for
[16:31] today amen they're looking for a great
[16:33] big Pastor amen so Priestly and godly
[16:36] walking around with big robes they call
[16:38] that
[16:39] beauty amen but we find here what the
[16:42] prophet of God is telling us real saints
[16:44] of God look for the character of the
[16:45] Vindicated word
[16:48] amen that's the character we're looking
[16:51] for amen that's what the Saints did in
[16:54] that day when they seen Jesus he was
[16:56] nothing to look at but they seen God was
[16:58] in him they so they also saw God was in
[17:01] David they stayed right with him they
[17:02] knew the anointing was upon David and
[17:04] they know that David was coming into
[17:06] Power amen and aren't we glad that we
[17:08] know Jesus is coming into Power amen
[17:11] amen he said all power in Heaven and
[17:13] Earth is given unto me but one of these
[17:15] days he'll take power over the Earth yes
[17:18] every King will have to bow down before
[17:20] him that's right amen hallelujah Biden
[17:23] will have to bow down before the Lord
[17:24] Jesus Christ Putin will have to bow down
[17:26] before the Lord Jesus Christ amen Kim
[17:29] somebody not the Sister Kim now Kim Jong
[17:33] I don't know what's his how you
[17:35] pronounce his name that North Korean
[17:37] leader will have to bow down before
[17:39] Jesus even netan will have to bow down
[17:42] before Jesus and ramapa and all of his
[17:44] beasts will have to bow down before
[17:46] Jesus
[17:48] am amen hallelujah hallelujah no matter
[17:52] how much they look up to men on the
[17:53] earth they can look up to MMA Gandhi
[17:55] because he was a good man they can look
[17:57] up to uh Nelson Mandela because he was a
[18:00] good man but never a man spake like our
[18:02] Lord Jesus Christ he's king of kings and
[18:05] he's Lord of
[18:06] lords he's the most influential person
[18:09] on the earth amen that's right and not
[18:11] only is influential on the earth he's
[18:13] also influential in heaven because
[18:15] heaven was about to come to a stand
[18:17] still because there was nobody found
[18:19] worthy to take the
[18:21] book amen but he was be able to
[18:23] influence heaven and he came there as a
[18:25] lion of the tribe of Judah able to take
[18:27] the book back to our title deed amen
[18:31] amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[18:35] amen amen you're in 147 of marriage and
[18:39] divorce a pure picture of the church
[18:41] today that will stand by the word of God
[18:45] Amen we know it's going to it's going to
[18:48] be made Vindicated we know it's coming
[18:51] into Power someday we know that he Jesus
[18:53] is coming into power too so we take that
[18:56] word and stand right there no matter
[18:58] matter what it
[18:59] cost if we have to cut Philistines or
[19:02] jump in the pit kill a lion as one did
[19:05] we go anyhow cuz that's the way God
[19:08] designed it to be we look for character
[19:11] amen so what are we learning here the
[19:13] character of a son and daughter of God
[19:16] is one who stays with the word
[19:18] amen not so much what he
[19:22] professes but how he lives his life
[19:25] according to the word amen not one who's
[19:28] defeated not one who's negative amen
[19:32] hallelujah turn to your neighbor and say
[19:33] stop being
[19:36] negative you see the other person didn't
[19:38] want to look at you because they don't
[19:39] want you to talk to them they want you
[19:41] to look at each other dead in the eye
[19:45] now sister brother Kenzo sister Jason
[19:48] wants to look at you
[19:52] there tell them again stop being
[19:54] negative being the word is power
[19:57] positive
[19:59] so we must be
[20:01] positive amen hallelujah there in lies
[20:04] most of our problems we only speak our
[20:06] problems this is not going right that is
[20:09] not going right this is wrong that is
[20:11] wrong nothing is ever
[20:12] right the only time you think something
[20:15] is right is when you are
[20:18] [Music]
[20:20] wrong amen hallelujah praise the
[20:24] Lord now there's one character that we
[20:27] can pattern our elves after and that's
[20:29] our Lord Jesus Christ amen is the only
[20:31] character given to man because all
[20:33] characters that flaws in the Bible
[20:36] That's why God could never fully Express
[20:37] himself through that man no matter how
[20:40] great the prophet was or prophets down
[20:43] through the Bible no matter how great
[20:44] the man was God couldn't fully Express
[20:47] himself through that man therefore he
[20:49] had to create a perfect body and express
[20:51] himself through Jesus Christ so we've
[20:54] come down through seven Church ages and
[20:56] God couldn't find a woman that he could
[20:58] perfectly Express himself through so he
[21:01] he selected a certain class of people
[21:03] that would receive the entire message
[21:05] under Malachi Chap 4:5 and under
[21:07] Revelation 10:7 who had identified the
[21:10] Luke 17:30 sign that this woman would be
[21:13] a woman that I can express myself
[21:15] through amen she will be the Eve that
[21:17] will confound the Earth that will
[21:20] confound
[21:21] Satan
[21:23] amen God couldn't do it through seven
[21:25] Church
[21:27] ages but he's found in end time people
[21:30] amen that are built upon all mysteries
[21:32] of God Amen I'm trying to show you what
[21:35] a special class of people you are don't
[21:37] get afraid of the power that's God going
[21:38] to unleash upon you amen don't don't be
[21:41] afraid also because God just won't dump
[21:43] his power on people with unbelief yeah
[21:46] amen we've got to looking for people of
[21:48] Faith amen therefore we are not looking
[21:50] for big numbers but we are looking for
[21:52] the quality of people that can take the
[21:54] word of God and handle it there amen
[21:57] hallelujah praise the Lord amen so if we
[21:59] want to look for character we look at
[22:01] the Lord Jesus Christ because we
[22:03] shouldn't have any natural man that we
[22:05] look up to because all men have
[22:10] flaws amen hallelujah yeah the prophet
[22:13] of God says look at his character watch
[22:16] his ministry as he worked then he works
[22:18] now as he was then he is now and will be
[22:21] forever and just what he did in them
[22:23] days he's doing it today he's just the
[22:25] same yesterday today and forever same
[22:27] time type of character amen he says a
[22:30] man that professes to be a Christian
[22:32] must have Christlike nature if it isn't
[22:36] there's another nature there which isn't
[22:39] Christlike amen he says if you're an if
[22:42] you're a killer if I told you at the
[22:44] Spirit of John Dillinger some famous
[22:46] Outlaw you'd expect me to have guns
[22:49] you'd you'd be dangerous to be sitting
[22:51] around where I was at cuz I'd be a
[22:56] murderer amen if I told you had the
[22:58] spirit of some famous mechanic you'd
[23:00] expect me to know what was wrong with
[23:02] your car if I looked at it if I told you
[23:04] the spirit of Christ was in me I must
[23:07] act like Christ you must act like Jesus
[23:10] your character and conduct must be
[23:12] molded like that and the Holy Spirit
[23:14] molds that conduct when he comes into
[23:17] you when you're really born again of the
[23:20] spirit of God there's the key now a man
[23:22] born in sin shaped in iniquity how does
[23:24] God equip him with the right kind of
[23:26] character the key is the Holy Ghost
[23:29] GH I'll say it again too many people are
[23:32] afraid of the Holy Ghost too many people
[23:35] want to make the Rapture without the
[23:36] Holy Ghost and that won't work there's
[23:39] no Rapture for you without the Holy
[23:40] Ghost you can say you believe all the
[23:43] word of God that's revealed through this
[23:45] Prophet but if you don't have the Holy
[23:46] Ghost there's no Rapture for you yes
[23:54] amen we
[23:56] find when a person is born growing up in
[23:59] life the things he
[24:01] reads the company he Associates with
[24:04] starts to mold the character of the
[24:06] person starts to influence the
[24:09] person amen the prophet of God is
[24:12] talking about Abraham Lincoln and he
[24:13] showing you how books can mold your
[24:18] character books can mold your character
[24:21] he says the only books we believe that
[24:23] Lincoln ever had until he was 21 years
[24:25] old was the Bible
[24:28] and the fox's book of mar that's what
[24:31] molded that
[24:34] character let me see what you read yeah
[24:37] let me go into your office amen are you
[24:40] going down this Lane
[24:43] again you like to come into my house
[24:45] every
[24:46] time Holy Spirit thou are welcome in
[24:50] this place I'm not too concerned what
[24:53] goes on in your house I just want you to
[24:54] make the
[24:55] Rapture amen hallelujah
[24:58] that's what I'm designed for Amen to
[25:00] build Faith within you to take a Rapture
[25:02] if I not a faith preacher amen preaching
[25:05] rapturing Faith to you I'm wasting my
[25:08] time I'm not sure to present theological
[25:11] sermons about some great mystery I'm
[25:14] here to prepare you for the Rapture amen
[25:16] amen hallelujah yes
[25:19] Lord let me see what you read let me go
[25:22] into your office in your house see what
[25:24] you read I will tell you what you are
[25:29] and you keep the Bible laying close to
[25:31] your children read it yourself amen be
[25:34] an example
[25:38] amen that's what I didn't have in my
[25:40] younger life the prophet is saying but
[25:42] by God's grace I want to put that before
[25:45] my children and if there is another
[25:47] generation may they put it before theirs
[25:50] and now if we could think today amen
[25:53] hallelujah so we know the Bible is a
[25:56] certain sound not an uncertain sound
[25:58] it identifies the characteristics of God
[26:00] in its
[26:02] sounding amen now what are the
[26:04] characteristics of God you are the
[26:07] characteristics of God God is expressing
[26:10] himself through you amen amen God's love
[26:13] can be expressed through you God's
[26:15] compassion can be expressed through you
[26:17] amen amen yeah we find here Jesus is
[26:21] saying in St John 37 10:37 if I do not
[26:25] the works of my father now watch are the
[26:27] prop is rephrasing it if I do not the
[26:31] works of my father and I don't have the
[26:33] character of my father then don't
[26:35] believe
[26:36] me they are the one they identify his
[26:39] character in me his
[26:41] characteristics and the characteristics
[26:44] of God is
[26:45] displayed by his promise for that
[26:49] age so the promise for this age after
[26:52] Revelation 10:7 is revelation
[26:55] 108-111 of people who are coming back in
[26:57] the image and likeness of God Amen who
[26:59] have dominion over the Earth so you are
[27:02] the characteristic of God being
[27:04] expressed on the
[27:07] earth amen hallelujah how did he do it
[27:11] yeah the prophet now I want you to
[27:13] follow this amen don't let it be tedious
[27:15] now I need you to Rejoice over the truth
[27:17] amen because maybe you haven't been this
[27:20] way before and maybe you need to go this
[27:22] way because maybe you don't know how to
[27:24] operate in this power and how to attain
[27:25] the character basically we are telling
[27:27] you now how to operate in the character
[27:30] and what are the basic steps that you
[27:32] [Music]
[27:35] need amen amen the gospel comes with
[27:38] progression we can't bypass any of the
[27:40] steps amen so it may sound tedious this
[27:43] morning but if we want to attain the
[27:45] characteristic of God the character of
[27:47] God the character amen hallelujah with
[27:50] power that is foot to rule these are the
[27:53] steps we need to take
[27:55] amen amen hallelujah so the New
[27:58] Testament we know is a New Covenant amen
[28:01] and the Lamb of God was slain and his
[28:03] blood in his blood was the life that has
[28:06] come upon us so the blood has life amen
[28:10] the prophet says blood is life in the
[28:12] New Testament life is from the blood of
[28:15] the Lamb which means New Testament New
[28:17] Covenant now the prophecy was after
[28:21] those days I will write my laws upon the
[28:23] fleshly tables of their heart amen amen
[28:27] the spirit Covenant will I make with the
[28:29] people and it displays his power here
[28:32] John 14:12 he that believeth on me the
[28:35] works that I do shall he do also shows
[28:37] that Jesus has met every requirement for
[28:40] us that God is required to make us back
[28:44] truly Sons and Daughters of God under
[28:46] the blood where there is no more
[28:48] condemnation amen amen yes you see this
[28:51] is key because some people can't get out
[28:54] from condemnation their past troubles
[28:56] them all the life yes amen because Satan
[29:00] uses the spirit which is as
[29:03] memory yes hello Satan uses a spirit
[29:07] which has memory and conscience and
[29:10] reasoning and affection and
[29:12] Imagination Satan uses a
[29:16] spirit to remind you of your
[29:19] past and what does it do it cripples
[29:23] Faith yes and it attracts fear amen but
[29:27] we've got to know there is power amen
[29:30] power Wonder workking power in the
[29:33] Precious Blood of the lamb and it
[29:35] cleanses me from all sin it cleanses me
[29:38] from every evil amen all of my past amen
[29:42] I am now a clean pure virgin Bride of
[29:45] the Lord Jesus Christ amen I stand
[29:48] sinless before his presence why because
[29:51] of the blood the life that was in the
[29:53] blood has come upon me and what is he
[29:56] doing building me up amen amen therefore
[29:59] Romans 8:1 says there is therefore now
[30:01] no condemnation to them that are in
[30:04] Christ Jesus amen amen see not those who
[30:07] are believing
[30:08] [Music]
[30:13] it brother sister I want to remind you
[30:17] the blood of Jesus cleanses you from all
[30:18] sin amen all
[30:21] condemnation amen you must be born again
[30:24] you can live in the Glorious victory of
[30:26] the Lord Jesus Christ if you submit
[30:27] yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[30:30] hallelujah not believing it but those
[30:33] who are in Christ walk not after the
[30:36] flesh but after the spirit amen no
[30:38] condemnation free from sin free from
[30:40] cares of the world no
[30:42] condemnation amen what is it doing the
[30:46] god of Heaven has accepted you his life

[31:10] God what are you amen son and amen
[31:14] hallelujah Lord praise the
[31:18] Lord you see the blood was applied and
[31:21] his life could not come upon the
[31:23] believer then for the life of the animal
[31:26] amen hallelujah now watch this is very
[31:28] important because Watch What Happens now
[31:30] when you accept the blood of
[31:33] Jesus everybody wave your hand to me
[31:35] amen I'm doing this for a purpose amen
[31:37] because this teaching can get a bit
[31:38] tedious right now and you can fall

[32:40] this wrong I'm living under condemnation

[32:47] a character like Christ you've got to
[32:49] accept all the promises of God I don't
[32:52] know if you know now that what I'm
[32:54] trying to tell you is that you've got to

[41:01] we cannot reign with him you have to
[41:04] suffer to rain the reason for that is
[41:07] character simply is never made without
[41:10] suffering some of you brothers and
[41:12] sisters sitting here have been through
[41:13] suffering in your life you've suffered
[41:15] because you've just been under the the
[41:17] weight of sin you've allowed Satan Amen
[41:19] to influence your mind but God is
[41:22] molding character through that
[41:24] suffering right
[41:27] character is a victory not a
[41:30] gift a man without character can't Reign
[41:33] because power apart from character is
[41:36] satanic but Power with character is fit
[41:39] to rule you see it to operate Mark 11:23
[41:42] the power you've got to have the
[41:44] character to be able to be foot to rule
[41:47] what do you think all creation is
[41:48] groaning for waiting to see your
[41:50] character yes the God man yes amen sir
[41:55] amen
[41:57] so don't be a faithless
[41:59] character amen be a perfect man a man of
[42:03] character that has the nature of Christ
[42:06] amen that's something you and I can't
[42:08] manufacture it takes the Holy Spirit to
[42:10] produce the Life of Christ amen amen now
[42:13] think about this there are many good
[42:15] moral men on the Earth
[42:16] right we may know some of them some of
[42:20] them you may say oh what a wonderful man
[42:22] this is what a
[42:23] wonderful lady this is they have such
[42:26] great morals good character but that's
[42:28] not what we're talking about these
[42:29] people do good deeds they go on feeding
[42:31] schemes they feed the poor they clothe
[42:34] the the amen those that need clothing
[42:36] real good
[42:38] people amen charitable but that's not
[42:42] the character we are talking about alone
[42:44] yes we must do good deeds yes we must
[42:46] feed the hungry yes we must clothe them
[42:49] that don't have
[42:50] clothes amen
[42:53] hallelujah but good deeds alone don't
[42:55] cut it we are talking amen because the
[42:58] man born of the flesh can't inherit the
[43:00] kingdom of God flesh and blood cannot
[43:03] inherit the kingdom of God Amen so
[43:06] matter no matter how good and decent and
[43:07] moral the person is if they are not born
[43:10] again they cannot attain eternal
[43:13] life we must be born so what is the
[43:15] kingdom of God the Holy
[43:17] Spirit how many of you can identify with
[43:19] that the kingdom of God is the holy
[43:21] spirit that's why Jesus said the kingdom
[43:23] of God is within you if you got the holy
[43:26] Spirit within you the kingdom of God is
[43:27] within you amen praise the Lord so we
[43:30] must be born again of water and of
[43:32] spirit that's the Holy Ghost within us
[43:34] begins to build the character of Christ
[43:37] amen the character that God is pleased
[43:38] with amen our best human efforts won't
[43:41] cut it unless become God's provided way
[43:44] amen so we just read a quote now about
[43:47] character being a victory if character
[43:49] is a victory not a gift means that we
[43:52] must overcome our human
[43:55] character yes to be
[43:58] victorious how do we overcome we must
[44:01] die to ourselves amen how many of you
[44:03] know that the most selfish people is the
[44:07] one you're looking at now the one I'm
[44:09] looking at now let me start looking at
[44:11] everyone here
[44:12] quickly the Bible says lovers of
[44:16] Self in the last days he High minded
[44:20] lovers of pleasure more than the lovers
[44:22] of God you see Enemy Number One is
[44:25] where yeah me I am Enemy Number One to
[44:29] myself amen so don't tell me I'm your
[44:32] enemy number one you have to wait in
[44:34] line I can only be number
[44:36] two to
[44:38] you because I am Enemy Number One to
[44:41] myself you can't come to me and accuse
[44:43] me and say you're my number one enemy
[44:45] you have to take number two
[44:47] spot because number one is me to me the
[44:52] one that is restricting the power of God
[44:54] in my life is me
[44:57] you see we've got to take responsibility
[44:59] amen we can't pass blame to the next
[45:01] person yes amen the one that is stopping
[45:05] me to be used to my full potential is
[45:07] me and I must die to myself and I Must
[45:11] Die daily
[45:12] amen amen
[45:15] hallelujah that's why we sing Let the
[45:18] beauty of Jesus be
[45:20] seen in me amen amen praise the Lord
[45:25] thank you Lord so the character of
[45:26] Christ is the character of Faith virtue
[45:29] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[45:32] brotherly kindness amen I'm if you know
[45:34] where the scripture is found second
[45:36] Peter amen amen you want to read it I
[45:39] know some of you don't read your Bibles
[45:41] amen so let's read it so you know where
[45:43] it's
[45:45] found second Peter chapter
[45:49] 1 in verse
[45:52] four whereby are given unto us exceeding
[45:55] great and pre precious promises that by
[45:57] these you might be partakers of the
[45:59] divine
[46:00] nature having escaped the corruption
[46:02] that is in the world through
[46:04] lust so there's a divine nature that
[46:07] must be attained and besides this giving
[46:09] all diligence add to your faith
[46:14] virtue and to Virtue
[46:17] knowledge and to knowledge
[46:20] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[46:23] and to patience godliness and to
[46:26] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[46:28] brotherly kindness
[46:30] charity for if these things be in
[46:34] you and abound they make that you shall
[46:38] be neither Barren nor unfruitful in the
[46:41] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[46:44] he that lack these things is blind and
[46:46] cannot see a far off and had forgotten
[46:48] that he was purged from his old sin
[46:51] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[46:53] diligence to make your calling and
[46:55] election sure for if you do these things
[46:57] you shall never
[46:59] fall am for so shall an entrance be
[47:03] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[47:06] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[47:08] Savior Jesus Christ so I don't need to
[47:11] say anything more that's how you get
[47:12] into the kingdom into the Rapture the
[47:15] key is
[47:16] there you'll never find any denomination
[47:19] preaching on the
[47:20] scripture you tell me one time show me T
[47:23] J's preaching on this scripture show me
[47:26] jool team preaching on the
[47:29] scripture go find any other Church
[47:31] preaching on the scripture but it's the
[47:34] entrance to Everlasting Kingdom of our
[47:36] Lord Jesus Christ why it's the character
[47:38] it's the life amen yes so what is the
[47:43] character the faith required to operate
[47:45] the third pole Mark 16 Mark 11:23 the
[47:48] faith of God so God's not going to dump
[47:51] his power onto you if you don't have the
[47:52] character required to operate faith God
[47:55] is telling us us to have the faith of
[47:56] God if you read Mark 11 20 how it starts
[48:00] he says have faith in God if you go and
[48:04] tap into that scripture you'll find it
[48:05] says have the faith of
[48:09] God Amen so it's not our own human Faith
[48:13] it's the faith of God in us and God in
[48:15] his people makes us a super sign it's no
[48:17] longer I that liveth but Christ that
[48:19] liveth in
[48:22] me amen so how God is going to present
[48:26] mold our character through trials yes
[48:28] through
[48:32] test so that's why the Apostle Paul says
[48:34] rejoice when these trials come upon you
[48:37] because father is molding you and
[48:39] shaping you amen a test is not to make
[48:42] you fall test is there to make you
[48:44] promote you to the next
[48:54] grade amen so each test we overcome we
[48:57] must pass in order to progress to the
[48:58] next level God worked with Moses this
[49:01] way amen God worked with Moses when he
[49:04] passed the first test he gave him moved
[49:06] him to the next level amen so God is
[49:08] patient with us aren't you glad we have
[49:10] a patient
[49:11] [Music]
[49:14] Lord he's working on us until we
[49:16] cooperate with his plan until we develop
[49:19] the character
[49:20] required amen it's the hardest thing for
[49:23] us to do is get ourselves out of the way
[49:26] so that God can work through us because
[49:28] we want to use our own human ability and
[49:30] that's not what God required God
[49:32] requires full obedience to his
[49:35] word so God is developing his character
[49:39] through his
[49:40] word and if we don't read the word our
[49:43] character can't be developed this is the
[49:45] sword that's shaping us molding us amen
[49:48] amen how many of you pledge to read the
[49:50] word of God amen amen read the word of
[49:53] God say Lord this is what you're using
[49:55] to mole me this is what you're using to
[49:58] shape me know you're saying we have the
[49:59] opening of the word amen our hearts have
[50:01] been been turned back but then the word
[50:03] is in our hand and we don't use
[50:05] it this is the opening of the word amen
[50:09] right
[50:11] here amen
[50:19] hallelujah so God is developing our
[50:21] character through the word because the
[50:23] word is a Heavenly word listen to this
[50:25] now the word is an Heavenly word amen
[50:29] amen hallelujah that's why the Bible
[50:31] says be not conformed to this
[50:34] world but be this word came from a
[50:36] Heavenly realm so we are conforming
[50:39] oursel to the Heavenly realm why we are
[50:42] preparing to leave Earth and go into
[50:43] heaven then we don't require another
[50:46] character if the Bible is giving us the
[50:48] character to live on Earth it's the same
[50:50] character we can take and go to heaven
[50:52] amen because the word came from heaven
[50:54] we don't need a a change of character
[50:56] when we go to heaven if we conform to
[50:58] the character of the word on the earth
[51:00] how many if you get what I'm
[51:04] saying the same
[51:07] word amen is effective on the earth and
[51:10] in
[51:12] heaven so I'm saying if you allow your
[51:15] character to be molded here on the earth
[51:17] it's the same character you can use to
[51:19] liveing Heaven because the same word
[51:21] shaped
[51:22] it you don't need another change of
[51:24] character to go into heav
[51:27] amen that's why we must conform to the
[51:29] character of God Amen praise the Lord
[51:34] amen the character to rule with dominion
[51:36] and Authority amen is in the
[51:39] word the character to rule and reign
[51:42] with authorities in the word but we
[51:44] don't take the word and apply it amen
[51:46] the word is developing us and making us
[51:48] candidates to live in heaven because the
[51:50] word of God transcends the earth into
[51:52] the heavenlies now you know that God
[51:54] worked with br brother Brandon in that
[51:56] way through his experiences he molded
[51:58] his character the way that God wanted to
[52:01] demonstrate his power through him
[52:03] through the first two pools of his
[52:04] ministry was the training ground that
[52:06] would eventually lead to the third pool
[52:09] but God had to correct him when he was
[52:12] going through the training of the first
[52:13] two pools and he told him he tried to
[52:15] explain the gift too
[52:16] much and he showed him the shoelaces
[52:18] which were all now in a mess you
[52:21] remember
[52:24] that M and then he told him because of
[52:27] this you cause kindly impersonations
[52:29] Oral Roberts came up on the scene a
[52:32] Allan all of these men kind
[52:35] impersonations because you explain the
[52:37] gift too much even now if you study the
[52:39] prophet's messages under that first and
[52:40] second po you can find Keys how to
[52:42] operate under the anointing because he
[52:44] explained it so
[52:47] much if you go on YouTube you'll find
[52:50] how brandom influenced my
[52:52] life talking about these Apostolic
[52:54] people on the Earth call themselves
[52:56] prophets they put YouTube videos out how
[52:58] brandom influenced my
[53:00] life how they begin to study his early
[53:03] sermons and learn to operate under the
[53:05] anointing I'm not talking about long ago
[53:07] go go Google it yourself and see few
[53:09] months ago they've been putting these
[53:10] things
[53:13] up why he explained the gift he
[53:16] explained how to operate in the
[53:17] anointing amen
[53:22] hallelujah now you remember the
[53:23] character that was required to pray for
[53:25] the baby that was
[53:30] sick remember the time now the tax man
[53:34] phoned he stepped out of the house and
[53:37] he said tell him I'm not
[53:40] home
[53:43] amen what happened the Holy Spirit would
[53:46] not move so you can see the character
[53:48] required to operate the power amen so
[53:51] even though he he may have tried to pray
[53:52] for the baby he had to go back and see
[53:54] the taxi man make that thing right and
[53:57] say you know what when you found I was
[53:59] at home but I stepped out of the door
[54:01] and I told my wife to tell you I'm not
[54:03] at home that man told Brother brandom I
[54:05] had a lot of confidence in you but I
[54:07] have even more confidence in you now
[54:09] amen what am i showing you the character
[54:12] required for the power of God to operate
[54:15] in your life so you can't leave these
[54:16] little things undone yes amen hallelujah
[54:21] amen we've got to learn how to submit
[54:23] under the authority of God yes
[54:26] [Music]
[54:31] think about how his character was molded
[54:33] when he listened to his mother-in-law
[54:35] and didn't go and preach to the
[54:36] Pentecostal people down
[54:38] there he it was a hard price to pay but
[54:41] what was God doing molding and shaping
[54:44] his character so that he would be able
[54:47] to submit to the Holy
[54:49] Spirit you remember when he came to
[54:51] Durban South Africa when he came to
[54:53] South Africa and the angel of God told
[54:55] him go to
[54:56] Durban and he listened to a bunch of
[54:59] ministers and he said I had to pay a
[55:01] price for it he had that stomach trouble
[55:04] after them because he refused to listen
[55:07] and heed the voice of the angel of God
[55:11] Amen you remember that
[55:14] Amen in coincidentally brother Rosco was
[55:17] mentioning this amen because he he said
[55:20] he had some fellowship with brother
[55:21] Billy Paul and he asked him how come you
[55:24] know were able to see the angel of God
[55:27] he
[55:28] said this is what it was this is now
[55:31] according to him and his conversation
[55:32] with Bly
[55:34] Paul that the reason why he was selected
[55:37] to see the angel of God when brother
[55:41] Bram was listening to those
[55:44] men and you know they were changing his
[55:46] schedule and the angel told him come to
[55:49] deran he says but the bully Paul told
[55:51] his dad dad why do we need to listen to
[55:54] these men yeah why don't we follow the
[55:56] leading of the angel of
[55:58] God and and this is believe Paul's
[56:01] testimony he says because I made that
[56:03] statement the angel of God was pleased
[56:05] with me amen and therefore he allowed me
[56:08] to see
[56:09] him amen so don't think the angel of God
[56:13] is not listening to our
[56:14] conversations when we choose to accept
[56:17] right when we choose to stay with the
[56:18] word of God amen amen praise the Lord
[56:23] amen so think of what a price he had to
[56:25] pay amen it's 11:23 right now amen we're
[56:29] going to close in a few minutes for
[56:30] those of you who think that amen we're
[56:33] going too long I'm not preaching long
[56:35] amen you are just
[56:37] [Music]
[56:38] bored amen praise the
[56:41] Lord so what is the character required
[56:44] I'm trying to show you how God will take
[56:46] you through our trials think of it he
[56:48] lost his child he lost his
[56:50] daughter he ended up with a stomach
[56:52] trouble because he didn't obey his the
[56:54] angel of God who said come to
[56:56] deran amen why
[56:59] deran why deran
[57:02] specifically
[57:05] amen I don't know if you caught the
[57:07] revelation of it but because of
[57:10] me
[57:12] amen the angel of God had a special
[57:14] place in his heart and still has a
[57:16] special place in his heart for Duran
[57:17] South Africa amen
[57:19] hallelujah in fact if you meet the angel
[57:21] of God ask him where is his favorite
[57:23] place he'll tell you der in South Africa
[57:26] you ask him who's his favorite person
[57:27] he'll tell you
[57:30] me amen and I'm sure if I ask him who's
[57:33] his favorite person to tell me you but
[57:35] that's what we got to believe why we
[57:37] welcome his
[57:39] presence amen hallelujah amen so look at
[57:43] the Hard trials yet to go look if you
[57:46] look in your own life look at the Hard
[57:47] experiences you've been through but God
[57:49] has called you back to him God is
[57:51] calling you
[57:53] back amen hallelujah
[57:56] sometimes it may seem like the pain of
[57:58] life is too hard the trial is too hard
[58:01] but look at the prophet's Journey you
[58:03] can make it you can overcome amen allow
[58:06] the Holy Spirit say Lord I'm submitting
[58:07] to your Holy Spirit Lord I've tried it
[58:09] my own way Lord I've tried my own life
[58:11] living my own life doing things my own
[58:13] way but I'm surrendering to you Lord
[58:15] Jesus I'm surrendering everything to you
[58:17] I'm surrendering my marriage I'm
[58:18] surrendering my finances I'm
[58:20] surrendering my children I'm
[58:21] surrendering my work I'm surrendering
[58:23] everything to you Lord Jesus Jesus and
[58:25] I'm asking you to take control of
[58:26] everything
[58:29] amen hand it over to Jesus am amen
[58:33] hallelujah praise the Lord remember he
[58:36] wants to mold and shape us amen God is
[58:38] trying to achieve in US amen hallelujah
[58:42] no matter how great the test he's
[58:43] molding our character he is the Potter
[58:45] we are just the clay so even in death
[58:48] when brother brandham couldn't
[58:50] understand and maybe in death in our own
[58:52] lives we don't understand we don't have
[58:54] the answer answer God is in perfect
[58:56] control ours is not to question why ours
[58:59] amen God will not give us more than we
[59:01] can bear but with the test will make a
[59:03] way of Escape ours is not to go into
[59:06] depression anxiety stress and worry amen
[59:09] you remember everything that a seed
[59:11] requires to grow to its full potential
[59:12] is within the
[59:14] seed a farmer can't add to the seed he's
[59:17] got to take the seed planted in the
[59:18] ground and Trust the process amen so it
[59:21] by
[59:23] faith
[59:25] that tree will eventually grow and
[59:26] produce
[59:27] fruits amen no manmade interference now
[59:31] the seed of God is within you everything
[59:33] that you require in this life to
[59:35] overcome this life is within you all the
[59:37] potentials is within you you've just got
[59:38] to swow yourself into the word of God
[59:40] die to ourselves let the tree grow amen
[59:43] and we will bring forth much fruit
[59:46] amen amen
[59:48] hallelujah amen stop looking through the
[59:51] eyes of Flesh start Looking Through The
[59:52] Eyes Of God start looking at stop
[59:55] looking at your zero bank balance and
[59:57] look through God's bank balance say my
[59:59] father owns a cattle on a thousand hills
[1:00:01] he will not suffer the righteous
[1:00:03] yes to go begging for bread amen I've
[1:00:07] never seen the righteous forsaken no he
[1:00:09] he begging for bread say Lord I The
[1:00:11] Chosen seed of God I will not beg for
[1:00:14] bread Lord you are my father you are my
[1:00:16] provider I'm trusting you to come in on
[1:00:17] the seene now and provide for
[1:00:23] me amen Trust the process amen so what
[1:00:26] are we doing we are coming to the climax
[1:00:27] of this age where Sons and Daughters of
[1:00:29] God are coming into
[1:00:31] manifestation sons of God are coming to
[1:00:34] sunship
[1:00:35] Authority amen we are answering
[1:00:37] Creations grown we are coming back to
[1:00:39] the position we lost in the Garden of
[1:00:40] Eden in the beginning amen this is the
[1:00:43] end of all things and at the end of all
[1:00:45] things all that was lost in Eden is
[1:00:47] regain all that Adam lost we gained
[1:00:50] through Christ
[1:00:52] amen you remember when brother brand was
[1:00:54] faced with a disrespectful
[1:00:56] couple what was his
[1:00:58] character he said he could have cursed
[1:01:01] them but his character was developed to
[1:01:04] such a place that he could love them and
