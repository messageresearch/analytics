[4:34] to go on two different
[4:36] battlefronts Ministry to God and two
[4:39] Battlefront but the Lord Knows Why amen
[4:41] amen and I believe it's uh strategic
[4:44] amen the Holy Ghost does things
[4:46] strategically amen but it was a blessing
[4:49] to be out there to preach at Pastor
[4:51] Dan's assembly on Sunday the Believers
[4:54] they were blessed and I heard the good
[4:56] report from that Jo were blessed out
[4:58] there and on Sunday as well so we know
[5:02] that God is doing a great thing amen
[5:04] amen and he's doing it all over the
[5:06] world amongst his bride amen
[5:09] amen you know the prophet of God says in
[5:12] in the message where I think Pentecost
[5:13] feely said oh sometimes we meod us get
[5:16] noise confused with
[5:18] anointing now noise ain't anointing no
[5:22] no I've seen where there's a lot of
[5:23] noise and not fi enough to cure to take
[5:27] yes see you got to come solemnly to the
[5:31] father you've got to know exactly where
[5:34] you are standing amen now we know we've
[5:37] seen lot of noise there there's nothing
[5:40] wrong to have noise in the house of God
[5:42] there's nothing wrong to have Fellowship
[5:44] but sometime they can just be noise and
[5:46] noise without the anointing
[5:50] yes then he said in another message he
[5:52] says now look a while ago when the Holy
[5:54] Spirit was falling that was the
[5:56] blessings of the Lord now this you see
[6:00] operating this way is the power of the
[6:03] Lord he said that's blessings don't get
[6:06] blessings and power mixed up yes you can
[6:09] have a blessing and not power enough to
[6:13] cure a
[6:15] two but power of the Lord is to manifest
[6:18] God
[6:19] Amen see what I mean the power of the
[6:22] lord and there was people out there that
[6:25] doesn't sorry that's what I was trying
[6:27] to say but the power of the Lord is to
[6:29] manifest God yes now you was to take the
[6:33] book to eat the book right right but we
[6:37] had
[6:38] the the word in the Zodiac we had the
[6:42] word in the pyramid we had the written
[6:44] word Jesus himself was the manifested
[6:47] word yes and in this hour it's the body
[6:51] of Christ must become the manifestation
[6:53] of the word every word that every
[6:56] promise that you're eating you there
[6:58] must be a manifestation
[7:00] of their promise man the reason why I
[7:03] read this quote I'll tell you why now
[7:05] let me just ask my wife are you feeling
[7:06] okay it's good fine I'm just going to
[7:09] read a
[7:11] testimony that I just I just came out to
[7:15] have a shower and my wife was giving me
[7:16] the chest I couldn't really hear what
[7:17] you're saying so much I said you know
[7:19] what do me a favor getting ready out for
[7:21] church just WhatsApp it to me and I'll
[7:23] read it I'll give you a testimony to the
[7:25] church so this is what a testimony was
[7:28] he said I was listening to the prophet
[7:30] and he was saying he was saying that we
[7:32] need to identify ourselves with the
[7:34] Bible that I was with Moses when he part
[7:37] of the red scene I was with the three
[7:40] Hebrew boys I was with David when he was
[7:42] rejected by his Brethren he said that we
[7:44] shouldn't have amnesia and know our
[7:46] identity he called a prayer line in the
[7:48] end and all through the message I had my
[7:50] hand on my face to e ease the pain I had
[7:53] on my tooth now I know from yesterday
[7:54] she had a terrible tooth and she was
[7:57] really suffering it so she think she
[7:59] listened to the message but she had a
[8:01] hand on her her face because of the to
[8:05] he said the prophet then said the lady
[8:06] with your hand in her face and went on
[8:09] to tell her her trouble he said it was
[8:12] different from mine but I identified
[8:14] myself with her to receive my healing he
[8:17] said few minutes later the pain
[8:20] left amen so that is taking having faith
[8:23] in God's word amen amen amen that's the
[8:26] wife's testimony today so she's sitting
[8:28] here now without any to
[8:30] but you had a terrible to take while
[8:32] listen to message amen amen so we praise
[8:34] God that we have a practical God Amen we
[8:37] we we seeing the the the gospel being
[8:40] practical it might be so simple in your
[8:43] house it might not be in a religious
[8:45] setup yes but everything that we
[8:48] preaching we we're not just preaching
[8:50] these things these are practical things
[8:52] we preaching amen amen so we seeing this
[8:55] word becoming manifested thank you amen
[8:59] so stand to our feet and we read the
[9:01] scripture
[9:03] tonight we all excited to be in the
[9:05] house of God amen amen so while it's
[9:08] raining here it's also raining missiles
[9:10] in
[9:14] Israel but we know there's also before
[9:17] all those things happen in the natural
[9:19] everything must happen in the
[9:21] Supernatural amen because there a
[9:23] spiritual bride that's rising up in
[9:25] power yes and all the enemies got the
[9:28] targets pointed at her M because she's
[9:30] the only enemy right now amen she's
[9:33] Satan's number one
[9:36] target
[9:38] amen famous portion of scripture
[9:40] Ephesians chapter 1 reading from verse 3
[9:43] to
[9:45] 6 and our appropriate in this hour in
[9:48] hour of maturity
[9:53] amen he said blessed be the God and the
[9:56] father of our Lord Jesus Christ when
[9:59] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[10:03] amen he Heavenly places in
[10:06] Christ according as he had chosen Us in
[10:09] him before the foundation of the
[10:12] world that we should be holy and Without
[10:15] Blame before him in
[10:17] love having predestinated us unto the
[10:21] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[10:25] himself according to the good pleasure
[10:29] of of his world amen amen you may be
[10:35] SE now we know to the caral mind being a
[10:39] Christian they say being a Christian is
[10:41] just a struggle that's a normal caral
[10:43] mind the thing in life we know it's you
[10:45] have to go to the ttings and things like
[10:47] that but the normal car man say no we
[10:50] just have to struggle against the enemy
[10:53] but they don't realize it's more than
[10:57] that amen we know we have to overcome
[11:00] but it's more than that
[11:02] amen because we placed you on a journey
[11:05] of being positionally placed in Christ
[11:08] to overcome yes amen from the time we we
[11:13] we come into Christ we placed on a
[11:15] journey amen because remember from the
[11:17] time man fell in the Garden of Eden the
[11:19] Journey of redemption started yes amen
[11:22] but each one of us when we were
[11:24] manifested on the earth we had to go on
[11:26] this journey from the time we receive
[11:29] Christ amen from the time we become
[11:32] awakened and we receive the new birth we
[11:34] come to accept Christ as our personal
[11:36] savior then we go to the new birth and
[11:38] so forth but we are going on a journey
[11:41] to be POS of being positionally placed
[11:43] in Christ for what to overcome the enemy
[11:47] amen
[11:49] amen
[11:50] because the enemy he was there put there
[11:54] to Mar the plan of
[11:56] God what he thought
[12:00] that he was overcoming Maring the plan
[12:02] of God but what he didn't realize he was
[12:05] created for God attributes to be
[12:07] manifested yes amen amen and part of God
[12:12] attribute was to be a savior but a
[12:14] bigger part of that for him to be a
[12:16] savior yet to have attributes of him yes
[12:20] yes which is you and I amen we are
[12:22] attributes of God that's why we are
[12:24] partakers of his divine nature
[12:27] yes so if
[12:29] overcoming requires us to understand our
[12:33] spiritual position in Christ
[12:37] amen now you can't it's easy to say
[12:39] overcome overcome we must be Overcomers
[12:41] in this
[12:42] day it's easy to I come I say we all
[12:45] must just be Overcomers we are meant to
[12:47] be
[12:48] Overcomers how are you going to do that
[12:50] without the message coming and showing
[12:51] you what is your position without the
[12:54] opening of the word coming this hour yes

[13:02] you come
[13:03] from you didn't know that the gene of
[13:06] God was within you you didn't know that
[13:09] you always was part of God because
[13:12] coming from organization and
[13:13] denominational teaching you just believe
[13:15] salvation just to be saved from hell
[13:18] yeah that's what you was that taught out
[13:21] there but when you come into the
[13:23] knowledge of the truth you realize that
[13:25] you always was part of God Amen that you
[13:28] are son and daughter of God to be
[13:30] manifested on earth yes that God had in
[13:33] himself that he wants to have a family
[13:36] amen and there had to be a time when his
[13:38] family had to be manifested you always
[13:40] was with him but there had to be a time
[13:42] where you had God had to express his
[13:45] thoughts out amen you have to become the

[16:39] back of the desert you don't come and
[16:41] train in front of the
[16:42] enemy amen you don't you don't have to
[16:45] go to the enemy and start now trying to
[16:48] figure out what you're going to pray for
[16:50] when you are facing a
[16:52] situation listen to what I'm saying now
[16:54] you might be put in a situation where
[16:56] your loved one got cancer where your
[16:58] loved one is demon possessed they need
[17:00] Deliverance you're not going to go there
[17:02] and learn try to figure out what type of
[17:03] prayer you're going to
[17:04] pray that's what your training ground is
[17:07] for you go you go in your Wilderness
[17:10] experience you go and study the word you
[17:13] go and spend time in your closet in
[17:16] prayer because there's going to be a
[17:18] time where you're going to face the
[17:20] enemy and then you better walk out there
[17:23] as a person in Authority amen Jesus did
[17:26] not go there and Min his word with the
[17:28] Devil
[17:29] with demons the apostles did not come
[17:31] there and Min their words with demon
[17:33] Spirits the the prophet of God you watch
[17:36] the prayer line You'll saw that compared
[17:38] to denominational preachers he didn't me
[17:40] his
[17:40] words he spoke as one with authority to
[17:43] cancer cases to TV cases to life and
[17:46] dead situations
[17:48] amen because he knew he is he knew his
[17:52] position in Christ he knew his backing
[17:55] amen he knew his mandates so we got got
[17:58] to know why we are placed here in this
[18:03] hour amen so we got to know our position
[18:07] in Christ you got to start off by that
[18:10] way Amen in the book of Colossians 2:10
[18:12] it says and here I complete in him which
[18:16] is the head of all principality and
[18:19] power so why are you afraid of little
[18:23] IM amen when he when he is the head of
[18:27] everything and you are coair with Christ
[18:31] and you are the body because he is the
[18:33] head of the church and the body and the
[18:34] and and and the head is together now
[18:36] because it's coming invisible
[18:38] Union and if you are in that invisible
[18:41] the head now is the head of all
[18:42] principality and
[18:44] power you are able to withstand every
[18:47] demon
[18:49] power so it starts off with first
[18:51] knowing your position in
[18:54] Christ amen you're not striving to
[18:56] attain that position
[18:58] but you are positionally placed through
[19:00] predestination amen amen amen he already
[19:04] predestinated you in that way he
[19:07] predestinated you to be part of the
[19:08] Bride you do not go by your intellect
[19:10] looking for a
[19:12] message you do not go looking saying is
[19:15] there something more that I can find and
[19:18] maybe go study the Book of Revelation
[19:19] you don't even know anything but the
[19:20] seals out of this
[19:24] message but you are predestinated to be
[19:26] born in this season you are pred
[19:29] that someday the light will come your
[19:31] way
[19:32] amen and God has preserved Us in his
[19:35] hour because this is the hour where
[19:37] there's going to be a people that's
[19:39] going to be changed from Mortal to
[19:40] immortality amen there's going to be a
[19:42] people that will not see Debs yes Amen
[19:45] in this hour amen he kept you and
[19:48] preserved you for this hour L and why
[19:51] you are to be kept for this hour if if
[19:53] you are meant to go in the rapt what
[19:55] type of person you are to be what type
[19:57] of position you should being in right
[19:59] now whatever Fai you've been walking in
[20:02] but you were predestinated for that
[20:05] amen that's why you find
[20:07] that so if you know that God
[20:09] predestinated you
[20:11] right and Christ already overcome Satan
[20:15] amen so that mean if you overcome Satan
[20:18] already then you already know the end
[20:20] result then you already know that you
[20:22] walking in Victory amen amen then you
[20:25] are placed in a position that will be a
[20:27] Victorious One
[20:31] amen you're not you're not going there
[20:34] and guessing what will happen in a
[20:36] certain circumstance you already know
[20:38] that you having a Victorious
[20:41] situation amen you can because you are
[20:43] placed in a position to have the
[20:46] victory amen and this is not based on
[20:50] our merits amen praise be to God and
[20:54] thank God for that it is based on the
[20:57] work of Christ amen amen amen but what
[21:01] makes it unique is because of a union is
[21:05] because of the Oneness amen that we
[21:09] become part of him that he dwell that's
[21:11] why I
[21:12] say the the spirit is calling that there
[21:16] must be us letting off and he completely
[21:20] comes and then from the outside he's
[21:22] been completely expressed in
[21:25] s so when you find that when you find
[21:28] that part now when we find our position
[21:31] we no longer fighting from a place of
[21:34] defeat amen yes you're not you're no
[21:37] longer on the back foot you're no longer
[21:39] in presuming amen what the result will
[21:42] be yes if he is the same yesterday today
[21:45] and
[21:46] forever this God that already defeated
[21:49] cancer
[21:50] cases amen if you already know the
[21:53] position and where he's been so you
[21:55] already know what the end result is
[21:56] going to be then we don't look and we
[22:00] know that this bride has to make a body
[22:02] have a body change so we don't look at a
[22:04] position of defeat amen yes we look at
[22:07] it and we don't focus on our weaknesses

[26:06] receive the spirit of bondage again to
[26:10] fear that's what the enemy wants to do
[26:12] he wants to hold you in bondage yes and
[26:16] that's why he's holding your brothers
[26:17] and sisters in
[26:18] bondage that's why they are
[26:21] fearful they don't realize they in
[26:23] bondage by the
[26:24] enemy that's why they're focusing on the
[26:27] things of the flesh where they feel like
[26:29] oh Lord I'm so far gone I can't come
[26:31] back to church I want to put my leg in
[26:34] the church but my other leg is in Egypt
[26:37] amen stuck in
[26:40] Leia because you know why the enemy is
[26:42] showing them no you can't go in church
[26:45] you're too far going now you spend too
[26:48] long
[26:49] be but that's the spirit of bondage yes
[26:54] now what the Bible
[26:56] says what so whatever you shall loose on
[26:59] Earth shall be Loos in heaven amen
[27:01] whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be
[27:03] bound in heaven
[27:05] amen so you on a spiritual battle now
[27:08] you got brothers and sisters that are in
[27:11] bondage but you have not received the
[27:13] spirit of bondage again to fear but they
[27:16] have received the spirit of adoption
[27:18] amen whereby we cry AB
[27:25] father now to overcome the enemy you got
[27:28] to come to that
[27:31] amen you've got to come to your
[27:33] placement yes you want to overcome the
[27:36] enemy you've got to come to your
[27:38] placement amen Joshua to positionally
[27:41] place the people into their
[27:43] inheritance
[27:45] amen that's why you'll find the ministry
[27:47] will keep telling you you got to know
[27:49] your position you got to come to your
[27:50] position you got to you can't stay the
[27:52] same you can't remain same in that
[27:56] condition you know some people there
[27:58] seem to be no sense of urgency in s i
[28:01] mean you're watching you know you know
[28:04] what it reminds me of if you look at
[28:05] natural
[28:06] Israel they were so used to Rockets
[28:09] being launched there every day the
[28:11] people in Israel it become so common to
[28:13] them Rockets were La every only the the
[28:16] only difference was they wouldn't feel
[28:18] it because they got this Dome Iron
[28:21] Dome you know it's like the ministry
[28:24] coming and preaching to them every week
[28:26] but now when different mes are coming
[28:29] now they were so used to they they
[28:31] didn't realize our seed is the SE
[28:33] because if you look at the amount of mes
[28:35] that came to e to Israel right now it
[28:37] could actually destroy the all of Israel
[28:39] if it landed there if it all exploded
[28:42] there but this bride wouldn't fall amen
[28:46] how many enemies are coming how many
[28:47] targets are coming at us right
[28:50] now we amen the prophet of God said not
[28:53] one bomb will fall on us amen that's
[28:56] right
[28:58] remember this is the bride now this is
[29:00] the wife of Jesus
[29:01] Christ but we're talking about now
[29:03] there's still people now that you are
[29:06] trained God is training you in the of a
[29:08] reason you might wonder why God is
[29:11] equiping you in a in a different
[29:13] way why why is he cing you and giving
[29:17] you word very
[29:20] strategically and showing you the way
[29:22] you should go now in this overcoming
[29:26] power and how to go in this battle
[29:28] yeah there's a reason that is why you
[29:31] you you can't just take it you've got to
[29:33] be sensitive you got to be sensitive to
[29:36] the way what the spirit is saying and
[29:38] understand why he strategically bringing
[29:42] certain type of messages to you amen is
[29:45] he coping you for a reason because you
[29:47] got brothers and sisters that are I felt
[29:51] they far too long gone but they out
[29:54] there and God cares about them you might
[29:57] think God God given up on them he hasn't
[29:59] given up on them amen maybe you have
[30:01] given up on them but God hasn't given up
[30:03] on them
[30:08] amen but we find that when we come to
[30:10] our placement and we know our rights and
[30:14] Authority amen then we speak then we
[30:17] have the power now to speak and act in
[30:19] Christ's name amen then we have the
[30:22] authority and realize that now we are
[30:24] joint a with him according to the Bible
[30:26] in Revelation 8:17
[30:29] and then we realize now we can take our
[30:31] in now we can take every promise that
[30:33] the Bible speaks
[30:35] about because why when you come to
[30:37] adoption then you have the legal rights
[30:40] to overcome the
[30:41] enemy because before that before that
[30:44] you're not a mature son to exercise
[30:45] those
[30:46] rights maybe you placed in the church
[30:48] your son you're growing up therefore you
[30:50] could say now I need to call the pastor
[30:52] to pray for the situation I need to call
[30:54] that brother to call pray for the situ
[30:55] but now you might be caught up where you
[30:57] can't call the pastor yeah you can't
[30:59] call the brother amen so when you going
[31:01] to come to your maturity amen because
[31:04] now you are placed here in the
[31:06] hour the it's not just the pastor's role
[31:09] is to CP you and if the pastor is coping
[31:11] you because he's putting you to go he's
[31:13] giving you the instruction as the pastor
[31:15] you go there in the Battlefront
[31:18] amen T not the pastor's duty to go out
[31:20] there his job is to equip you and lead
[31:23] you and say this is what you need to do
[31:24] this is what you need to do then you
[31:26] need to go there now with they equipment
[31:28] that you got and use it am amen you get
[31:32] what I'm saying amen
[31:35] amen but now for you to exercise that
[31:38] right now you got to to for you to have
[31:41] that legal right to overcome the
[31:44] enemy you got to
[31:47] recognize that you have to come to the
[31:49] state of maturity you can't be
[31:53] complacent you can't be in the same
[31:55] situation over and over
[32:01] amen it's a war yes and when there's a
[32:05] war on life is not normal yeah life is
[32:09] not normal you in know what time you

[32:14] on my country is in war right now the
[32:16] bombs are flaring I'll go have an
[32:18] holiday in the
[32:20] beach I'm talking about spiritually

[32:26] you going to have a c life of Prayer
[32:28] and dedication to the things of God yes
[32:31] a time of keep going into his word
[32:33] getting encouraged by his word amen he's
[32:37] given us all of his
[32:40] word the prophet of God says you think
[32:43] cancer is something the Bible said there
[32:45] is coming a time when men will rot in
[32:48] their flesh and the buzzers will eat of
[32:51] their cus before they even
[32:53] die he said cancer is a toake to what's
[32:56] coming

[33:01] afraid of cancer yet cancer is like the
[33:04] number one enemy for medical science

[33:07] now but he's saying it's like a twoot to
[33:10] what's coming but remember that horrible
[33:13] thing was forbidden in that day to touch
[33:15] those who had the Seal of God he said
[33:17] that's what we striving for now to get
[33:19] in and be positionally placed into the
[33:22] kingdom of God before these horrible
[33:24] plagues strike
[33:30] amen amen then he says how was our
[33:33] inheritance given to us through what
[33:37] predestination predestination is for
[33:39] knowledge how did God know he could

[37:30] system but you can't have a shortcut to

[37:36] process amen cuz God soldiers are elite
[37:40] soldiers this is an invincible Army this
[37:44] is a super church this is a super race
[37:48] you already predestinated to be that so
[37:50] if you predes that's the end result then
[37:53] you must go through every part even if
[37:55] you go away with it's going to bring you
[37:56] in if you have to break your leg you
[37:58] break your leg and how break your leg
[38:00] through the word through the five4
[38:02] ministry
[38:03] amen love is
[38:06] corrective amen but you're not getting
[38:08] lost
[38:09] amen and if if you throw you away by
[38:12] Satan for a while send you away till you
[38:14] go on your knees and realize true
[38:16] repentance amen oh yes
[38:19] amen sometimes you got to bring you back
[38:21] to the altar yes
[38:24] amen
[38:26] so you must go through the process of
[38:28] training and you can't hide through it
[38:30] amen amen and we know that as a child
[38:35] you won't give the child any
[38:36] responsibility at each stage of the
[38:38] child's life as they getting more mature
[38:40] you give them a little bit more
[38:41] responsibility amen as you get more
[38:44] mature you get them more responsibility
[38:45] yes amen you say when you come to anyone
[38:47] we give you a key in other words we
[38:48] giving you you we see you mature now you
[38:51] can handle things you can go and you
[38:54] come and like we have trust and
[38:55] confidence in you so until until much is
[38:58] given much is
[39:00] required the
[39:03] more the more exess is given to you the
[39:06] more Authority is given you that means
[39:08] more is required from you amen yes so
[39:13] sometimes when you get all this nice
[39:15] things that God is speaking to you and
[39:16] you getting this nice word week after
[39:18] week from your pastor then you might
[39:21] need to get a B worried because now
[39:23] there's a bigger
[39:24] responsibility the Bible says that and
[39:26] so much is given
[39:28] much is required amen amen so you get
[39:31] excited say I've got all this there's a
[39:34] reason okay in the Army you got
[39:38] different soldiers right different for
[39:40] different forms of soldiers but you also
[39:42] get special special soldiers elite
[39:44] soldiers your special forces and so
[39:47] forth right they can they go to
[39:50] different types of training there's a
[39:52] bigger responsibility on them amen
[39:55] because why they went to more better
[39:57] training than the other soldiers they
[39:59] went to training that other soldiers
[40:00] don't know
[40:02] of some sometimes they do some covert
[40:05] operations and it's very secretive and
[40:08] the the type of training they receive
[40:10] not everybody knows that is not revealed
[40:13] to everybody else yes so much is given
[40:17] much is required
[40:20] amen but as you come to discipline and
[40:25] to this process of maturity you realize
[40:27] that he's preparing you to handle to
[40:30] handle the word with
[40:33] responsibility and is if I could put it
[40:36] this way is to handle your Spiritual
[40:38] Authority that's given to you amen yes
[40:41] amen you know how to go and face up a
[40:43] situation sometime you might wonder why
[40:46] Lord why am I going through the
[40:48] situation God allows certain things to
[40:50] come maybe your own family member went
[40:52] to certain sicknesses and so forth you
[40:53] went to some trials and tesy God is
[40:56] allowing these things to mature
[40:59] you God put you to trials and testing
[41:01] for a reason and you might wonder why
[41:04] you're going through it but the Bible
[41:06] says not some things he said all things
[41:08] work together for the good to them that
[41:10] love the Lord and according to his
[41:11] purpose amen so you might say but God is
[41:14] giving you the training grounds the
[41:16] situations in your life to overcome
[41:19] bigger situations oh he's giving you the
[41:22] small things to overcome because if you
[41:25] can't overcome the Small Things how you
[41:26] going to overcome the big amen how you
[41:28] going to be an overcomer for the age
[41:31] itself amen and to overcome it because
[41:33] you are the people that called not to
[41:35] meet a rap take a Rapture you are called
[41:38] to defy all the laws of gravity and so
[41:41] forth
[41:43] amen amen amen 1 Samuel
[41:47] 17 you can open to that 1 Samuel 17: 34
[41:51] to 37 he speaking about David
[41:54] here and David said unto Saul
[41:57] thy servant kept his father's sheep and
[42:01] there came a lion and a
[42:02] bear and took a lamb out of the flock so
[42:06] he's talking about two in two different
[42:09] incidents David is sharing his training
[42:12] ground because David now before he had
[42:16] to face Goliath David had to overcome
[42:18] other
[42:21] obstacles right that was his training
[42:23] ground not front of now remember before
[42:26] he fa
[42:28] Israel and does what he has to do in
[42:31] front of Israel where it can be now this
[42:34] is the king of
[42:37] Israel the king of Israel before that
[42:40] situation comes that everyone is going
[42:42] to see this overcoming now he had some
[42:45] personal overcoming that nobody
[42:47] saw Amen in the wilderness overcoming a
[42:51] lion overcoming a bear nobody saw it but
[42:56] he testifying of it
[42:58] amen but now that was his personal
[43:00] experience but from his personal
[43:03] experience Watch What Happens now he
[43:05] says and
[43:06] David so he told to Saul and took a lamb
[43:09] out of the flock and I went after him
[43:13] and smot him and delivered it out of his
[43:15] mouth when he arose against me and I
[43:19] caught him by his beard and smot him and
[43:21] slew him thy servant slew both The Lion
[43:23] and the bear and this
[43:27] Philistine shall be as one of them
[43:31] seeing he had defied the armies of the
[43:34] Living God David said moreover the Lord
[43:36] that delivered me out of the Paw of the
[43:38] lion and out of the pow of the bay he
[43:40] will deliver me out of the hand of the
[43:42] Philistines amen you see he knows his
[43:47] position David is being positionally
[43:49] placed amen but he had to go to
[43:52] different experiences on the training
[43:55] ground even when no one was
[43:57] watching between him and God Amen and he
[44:01] knew that God was with him yes amen but
[44:04] remember this is an anointed servant of
[44:07] God he was anointed amen yes and he
[44:11] watch after the anointing comes upon him
[44:13] now he's watching God being with him and
[44:16] he's overcoming the enemy and now those
[44:20] way training ground but now in the midst
[44:22] of
[44:24] Israel when Israel now is so Fe
[44:28] fearful amen when the brothers are
[44:30] fearful of the things that are happening
[44:31] around them when the brothers don't have
[44:34] the confidence anymore they are afraid
[44:36] of gol they're afraid of what's
[44:38] happening on the Earth right
[44:40] now David now is going to take what is
[44:43] equipped to it what happened in the
[44:46] wilderness and he goes in the midst now
[44:49] in front of his Brethren now the thing
[44:51] that the Brethren are afraid of Amen the
[44:53] golad that is the mid of them whether
[44:56] the golad is the sickness whether the
[44:58] GOL is is some kind of obstacle
[45:01] spiritually
[45:02] speaking does David is going to overcome
[45:04] this gol
[45:06] now in front of his Brethren
[45:12] amen so we find that we know the story
[45:14] how David eventually because of his
[45:17] position because of his confidence amen
[45:20] that in 1 Samuel
[45:22] 17:45 to 46 is actually prophesying
[45:25] before y over comes
[45:27] he saying in 45 it says then said David
[45:31] to the Philistine thou comest to me with
[45:33] a sword and with a spear and with a
[45:36] shield but I come to thee in the name of
[45:38] the Lord of hosts the god of the armies
[45:40] of Israel which thou has defiled this
[45:43] day will the Lord deliver thee into my
[45:45] hand and I will smite thee and take
[45:47] thine head from thee and I will give the
[45:50] cus of the host of the Philistines this
[45:52] day unto the fowls of the air and to the
[45:55] wild beast of the earth that all the
[45:56] Earth may know that there is a God in
[45:59] Israel now this never happened yet but
[46:03] what David is prophesying or what he's
[46:06] going to do because what he's speaking
[46:08] is going to be
[46:10] manifested amen do you hear what I'm
[46:12] saying when a person knows their
[46:15] position thou must prophesy again amen
[46:18] amen when you know your prayer as pastan
[46:21] preach your prayer must become prophecy
[46:24] amen so before this before the Manifest
[46:27] ation is speaking it amen amen and what
[46:30] he speaks now becomes manifested in the
[46:33] end
[46:34] results amen so David showed the
[46:36] children of Israel what overcoming is
[46:38] all about
[46:43] amen so we find that even our trials
[46:46] amen it's all our God's great plan to
[46:49] develop our faith to bring us into a
[46:52] faith amen it's all it's all our
[46:54] training ground it might have in our
[46:57] quiet times it might happen in our
[46:59] personal space
[47:01] amen but God is equipping us for the
[47:03] things that will happen out there amen
[47:06] amen thank you
[47:09] Lord so you might find that sometimes
[47:12] God blesses you in Little
[47:15] Things David was faithful in protecting
[47:17] the Sheep yes he wasn't a king then he
[47:21] was just protecting the Sheep he was a
[47:25] Shepherd but
[47:27] you know even Luke 16 10 says Jesus is
[47:30] saying he who is faithful in what is
[47:32] least is faithful also in
[47:34] much you see you might be in a small
[47:38] little position in the body you might
[47:41] think it's not so significant but God is
[47:44] watching you God is watching your
[47:47] faithfulness amen whether you you
[47:49] holding a certain uh you're part of the
[47:51] government of the church whether you a
[47:53] church whether your a Believer coming

[48:52] is leading you amen God must take you to
[48:55] the little things first he must take you

[49:08] sheep because that was all symbols there
[49:11] God sh him the greater thing because he
[49:12] is going to be the shepherd of
[49:14] Israel

[50:31] illustration of that soldier that lost
[50:33] his mind and they had to take him on a
[50:35] path and he's following him walking
[50:36] walking walking until eventually he
[50:39] could find his identity amen amen he
[50:41] could take him out of Amnesia amen some
[50:44] people are trapped in Amnesia they're
