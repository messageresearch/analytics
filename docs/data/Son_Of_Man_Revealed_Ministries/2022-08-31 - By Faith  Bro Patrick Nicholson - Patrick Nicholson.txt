you and um happy to be back in the house of the lord amen amen and always um jittery when we approach his word as we know it's such a fearful thing yes to be in the hands or fall into the hands of the living god amen so to us we know that makes you kind of um respect the podium the sacredness amen knowing that god will hold us accountable for every word that we speak i trust that the lord will certainly bless you tonight nothing new nothing old amen jesus is ever present with amen thank god for putting the heart of the pastor to allow me to arrest you tonight so it's his flock that i'm addressing so i just want to be quick here tonight and know that whatever we say it will carry not only his blessing but carry the blessing of the holy spirit amen i trust that hallelujah will give us grace as we are heads and close our eyes heavenly father thank you for this wonderful privilege we have to come into your presence as we know that great is he that's within us i pray now that you bless your word i am your servant behind the cross and no thresh will be glorified that my lips will speak divine words because my words will fail but your words cannot and i believe that we know that your words will still remain after millions of years it will be the same it was millions of years the same before it even came in the pages of the bible and we know that we have to stay within the pages of the bible from genesis to revelation because whoever takes away or adds there's a curse on that person amen that's why we want to pray that you bless us lord as we keep to your word in the name of jesus christ bless the pastor of this church of god bless everyone that's that he leads bless everyone of god that has been ordained to support him yes in the name of jesus christ we pray a blessing father bless everything that will be done from here on in jesus christ amen in the book of james chapter 2 and verse 21 my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of persons for if they come unto your assembly or your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and they come in also a man in vile raymond and you have respect to him of the gay clothing and saying to him here in a good place and say to the poor stand out there or sit here under my footstool are you not then partial in yourselves and i'll become judges of evil thoughts how can my beloved brethren have not god chosen the poor of this world which in faith is a kingdom which he had promised to them that love him but he have despised the poor do not reach men oppress you and draw you before the judgment says do not they blaspheme the worthy name by which you have called yeah fulfill the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you well amen but if you respect but if you have respect to persons you commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors amen for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet to offend in one point he is guilty yes amen for he that said do not commit a doubt he said also do not kill now if you committed if thou commit no adultery yet you without kill now thou become a transgressor of the law so speak he and so do and say that shall be judged by the law of liberty for he shall have judgment without mercy that has shown no mercy and mercy rejoices against judgment amen so [Music] may the lord bless the reading of his works obviously and i'd like to go to verse 20 also and read that portion of scripture but walt down know o vain man that faith without works is dead amen well it's my title i would like to stay by it's a simple title amen nothing new and as you can see the scriptures that we read it points to that one thing that we want to speak on by faith amen hallelujah so we we know that there's a difference between religion yes and how many amen a lot of people will say that my my faith is catholic and then for my faith is message but that's just a religion yes that we are talking about but faith amen um works amen your work's cruel who you are and where you come from or where you're going because what action you have has got a um absolute move a man you are moving towards where your works are so amen if if orange tree puts out apples there's something wrong and yeah orange trees actually a hypocrite because it's supposed to put up oranges so the same way with a christian when he puts out different fruits and what a christian should put out he doesn't have faith according to the bible amen it's only he's only got a religion so um we can even read in the bible if a man among you seem to be religious and bridal is not his top amen that um he said he deceives his own heart and his religion amen so pure religion and undefiled before god the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction yes and to keep himself unspotted from amen amen and then we have by faith in chapter 2 hallelujah amen so we thank the lord for giving us the faith that was once delivered yes amen amen hallelujah so it's important to know what kind of a faith you have yes because um we look at the faith in the bible where by faith evil by faith by faith sarah or abraham and all those [Music] people of what we would call great faith but faith is the substance of things hopeful yes and it's evidence of things not seen so so faith moves in the unseen reality yes and we have to understand that it's not natural it's it's it's something that is tangible yet you can't touch it with the five senses amen and that's why we find that the prophet has got or he rather added another sense that cannot be handled as you know shaking the hands of the past and thinking that you've got yeah amen amen and you find that many times you think uh you know your faith is because of you've done some some thing to be a i pleaser you do i service yes everything you do somebody must see me do it yes and then i know i'm kind of the person that is looked up to and that's why you get you get rich in those kind of the things where people oh pet you on the back and the moment you find that uh you are wanted you are known you are that kind of a person that oh yes i've got the front seat i've got the middle seat of i've got the seat where everybody knows that's my seating man now your number is not on any seat in this church faith beyond church going to church shaking the pastor's hand or being nice to the deacon when he knocks on your door and give him a cup of tea and saying goodbye and then you find yourself in a position where you don't have the faith that god is looking for so we find this kind of a faith or if we can put it that way the lack of this kind of a faith in the book of kings chapter 1 and i'm going to read it quickly and the bible says uh i'd like to maybe take it from verse 17. if i can find it let me just get it right here one thing i want to take it further down even if even as i swear unto thee that's now 1 kings 1 and verse 30. even as i swear unto thee by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will i certainly do this day then bathsheba bowed a face to the earth and the reverence of the king and said let my lord king david live forever as king david said call me zarak the priest and nathan the prophet and benight the naya the son of jehohada and they came before the king the king also said unto them take with you the servants of the lord and call solomon my son to ride upon my own mule and bring him down to gion and let zara the priest and nathan the prophet anointing their king over israel and blow ye that with the trumpet and say god save king solomon amen now here was a thing that was happening in the kingdom of where david was king and bathsheba realized that before somebody else becomes king there was a promise made to solomon now solomon being the king that was said by god that he was going to have david was going to have his son to reign we find that here comes another person to try to usurp the authority to become king now let's look at this and and look who this king really was gerald bower the son of nabette and ifr the first king of the 10 tribes over whom he reigned 22 years and he was the son of the video of zoretta and while yet so young was promoted by solomon to be chief superintendent of the burden that is of the bans forced by laborers influenced by the words of the prophet ahijah he began to form conspiracies with the view of becoming king of the ten tribes by these these having been discovered he fled to egypt where he remained for a length of time now look at this jeroboam the son of the successor of joe and the 14th king of israel over which he ruled for 41 years he followed the example of the first jeroboam in keeping up the worship of golden cows his reign was contemporary with those a messiah second kings and uzziah kings of judah he was victorious over the syrians extended israel to its former limits from the entering of hamas to the sea of the plain his reign of 41 years was the most prosperous that israel had ever known as yet with all this outward prosperity so we have to find ourselves in a situation where when god says the king reigns that's the king that reigns you can't place another king in his state amen and now we realize that when those kings had the issue there was no faith involved because it was all about who sits where amen and we find jeroboam being a reign of 41 years was the most prosperous and it was it was such a terrible time that they built carves golden calves to worship just imagine golden cows instead of god being worshiped so what kind of a faith do we have yes amen a monument faith that there was no movement of god amongst him but by faith we have to move where god says move amen hallelujah we have to take god at his word regardless yes of what man says regardless of who wants to be the next king regardless of who says i am the best man among you it takes god to come down to the point where he says i am the king amen god becomes king in that man now let's go to the quotations and find what faith does what does faith really do was not abram or father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see is how faith with his works and by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled saying abram believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god amen hallelujah you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only yes likewise rehab the heart justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also see it looks like paul was speaking in romans the fourth chapter justifying abraham by faith and james is justifying him by words yeah but it does not contradict because paul was speaking of what god saw in abraham james was speaking what man saw in abraham [Music] paul was speaking of what god saw in abraham in genesis 6 we when he told him that he was going to have the child by sarah or paul and abram believed god and it was impute imputed him unto him for righteousness he believed the promise that's what god saw when james spoke he was speaking of what man saw in genesis 22 where abram offered up isaac because that's the works amen he was going to kill isaac amen on the altar see what faith you have that's what god sees amen amen amen amen but what your words is that's what your neighbor said amen amen oh yes amen show me your works by your faith without your faith and i'll show you my words by my faith see so that this audience here has faith i believe that but i believe you're afraid to turn it loose i believe that if you would just let your faith amen amen yes it's like that horse wild horse while it's tired it's just trying to pull loose amen but as long as that rope is on its neck it can go nowhere yes but let it go loose it will just keep on running amen hallelujah man so you see you have to have works you have to push on that faith that's on the inside of you if you don't push it out it's just going to lay dormant yes remember what we said that faith is a seed and as long as you are keeping it in your hand you have to let it go you have to sew it you have to release it and once it's released it falls into ground yeah it falls into good ground it falls on phony the thornies and it falls on stones and it falls a man where it can be chopped out it can be picked up but when it falls on good ground it brings forth in abundance yes that's why jesus said unless or except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone so you see once that faith falls into the ground when it dies then you you you are not patted on the back like you know when you came into the message everybody liked you hallelujah everybody wanted to be in your company but then it was like jesus when he said except you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the son of man you have no part in me and they say well this man is a vampire 17 that joined him left him went back to caiaphas [Music] priestly man so you find yourself in that situation where when you long in the message then you start to learn now if you're not learning the message then you are becoming stagnant so once you start learning you find that you are getting revelation upon revelations so you're adding to your faith amen and once you add to your faith you find yourself something new it comes your way things that you've never seen before god reveals to you at that time amen when you are ready amen you can't give a baby a steak yeah from land or chicken from nando's you have to give that baby its food in due season amen otherwise it kills them amen and that's why when you are born again now people think that when you're born again oh yes you have a beginning of the new birth and there is an acceptance of your faith and that is the full birth when the baby cries out hallelujah amen amen every year baby cried hallelujah [Music] we are talking about spiritual babies amen christ yes there's something about you that you know you're not still born yes you cry out now we don't want you to maybe cry out in church but when you cry out in prayer when you crowd before god and your wife hears you and says what's happening to jeremiah in the in the room back there there's something strange but there was something that struck jeremiah at that point something that he never saw when he came into the message amen yes and then he cries out a hallelujah so much so it's because his faith is broken amen he's getting revelation upon revelation because without revelation and the bible says or i think the prophet did say this he said faith is a revelation amen anybody believe that amen faith is a revelation so when abel received a revelation that was faith he had faith and remember if you don't have faith god is not pleased with your lack of faith yes can you say now how do i get faith amen remember you don't have to work for faith it's a free gift god gives it to you yes amen he says yes faith add to your faith now is the seed and amen or rather let it die [Music] amen once that faith dies it brings out life yes and the life starts to mature amen and starts to build the bone so once you are adding to your faith remember [Music] you can still just be a baby a man just pushing out there's no spirit in you yet because remember we have to be accepted by god god accepts your faith yes once god accepts your faith he seals it away yes heals your faith now just imagine cook coke has to find a bottle and that bottle might be in the mud amen now look at yourself once that bottle is found the coke looks at that bottle and says this is coke it belongs to coke the name written down is this is coca-cola company yes written on the bottle skulk's bottle but now it's full thing it's found in the mud now look at you as that sinner amen saved by grace amen you are you were a son of god but you are dirty you are muddy you are unsanctified but you are justified yes hallelujah that's why we find ourselves as a son of god you are justified and justified by faith amen nothing else amen you're not justified by a church you belong to yes you're not justified because you read the bible every night you're not justified because you fast you're justified because god gave you life amen but that life can be laying under the ground to see it's the sun and that's why church ages in the book of church ages has said that a son can go a long way before it recognizes that it's just not yes amen hallelujah it's way back yeah but you're a son yes you you are justified before you know you are justified amen because god can't lose you amen he knew you before the world ever amen to uh be a molecule before there was a molecule you was there so now he justifies you he brings you up now he has to sanctify yes he has to clean you up so it's all a work of faith it's by faith amen by faith you are justified by faith you are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ by faith you are sanctified yes amen add to your faith let your knowledge can prince patience god and his brother be kindness so forth and then when god sees that adding you you're adding amen he gives you now paul speaks about faith to faith amen how does that work let's look at the musician for a while the musician has got no remy foster lucky amen so why to those why faith to faith amen why from light which is infrared to ultraviolet still light so when you look through the rainbow you find that ultraviolet cannot be seen by the eye neither can infrared because it's beyond the spectrum of vision hallelujah so now we have to find why faith to faith when paul speaks about faith to faith because it's the same gift that has been glorified amen the same gift because it's not a different faith when you get to the top of the pyramid it's the same thing it's just worked out amen and it's it's so much work to the extent that god accepts it amen but it's now fruit he's his fruit he came to the fig tree and he was expecting to find fruit a man thing because it was a fig leaf it had leaves and before you know when the leaf is there the fruit should be there otherwise it's a hypocritical tree it's clapping its hands in the wind the leaves are lit hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord but there's no fruit yeah hallelujah how do you know that a man claps his hands and there's no fruit he doesn't read his bible he doesn't pray he doesn't give god thanks and he doesn't testify amen about the goodness of god and that's where we have to find ourselves friends amen if you're sick you must testify amen amen that is by faith yes amen yes hallelujah if you're a christian you must tell your boss amen by faith hallelujah if your wife is not saved tell her honey i'm a christian that's by faith my faith alone so you have taken or you've been given faith god gives you the faith you don't get it from the past you don't get it from the church you don't get it from the tapes and the books of william branham you get it from god it's a gift amen hallelujah if i give you this time amen it belongs to it no more belongs to me it's yours hallelujah and when i give the style to you and many witnesses in a court of law will be witnesses against me that i want to take this night back amen and that's why god says add to your faith amen yes amen because it's your faith now but he gave it to you and when he gives you it's like the man that was given five and one and uh ten and the ten made ten the five made five and the one made one amen or whatever or the one didn't make anything he just give gave back to one so that's what when you when you're given faith you have to you have to put it where uh the man said why didn't you put it in the usually where i can gather interest amen rather than bury it very far away and that's we are not talking about bearing in the in the ground of of of the word of god we are talking about you are hiding who you are yes amen amen you are not telling the devil who you are amen yes and as long as you are not telling the devil who you are there is no growth yes absolutely no growth because your growth comes when you make the devil ashamed of you amen amen tell the devil and say satan i'm the son of god hallelujah amen you know what all of a sudden yeah satan thought you behind him but when he opens his eyes you are facing him yes hallelujah toe to toe hand your hands you are holding him right there hear what he says but who are you you i thought you behind me amen you know when you lie you're behind the devil you're not in front of him amen he's he's always ahead of you he lied before you ever once or started your life amen so you have to realize that when you face the devil the prophet would make the statement and he says all hell's guns are trained on the team amen no you wouldn't want that would you hey man you you don't you're a peaceful guy you you don't want to have no wall but when you say i'm a son of god satan points every atomic energy that he's got at you amen amen so when you walk remember all hell is firing at you amen amen because now you are walking by faith [Music] hallelujah amen so now you have to recognize that matters not what you do your boss is against you your wife is against you your husband is against you everything is against you because of what you just uttered by your lips i'm a son of god hallelujah and when you when when the devil recognizes by what you say amen you are trampling the moment you wake up the moment you place your feet on the ground hallelujah or your knees satan is trembling amen one word that you speak in the name of the lord jesus christ when you pray in the morning it's by faith amen because you don't see god god is nowhere to be sin he's not in the bathroom he's not in the lounge he's not in the bedroom but he's somewhere by faith hallelujah thank you and you have to find him at that moment you have to recognize that if you don't find god now satan has got his eyes on you he's focused only on you amen so you have to know where you stand hallelujah when you stand amen don't mess around with the devil sister brother he's got you covered amen how many times so now when you throw that feed into the ground amen it's either you are storing it and just leaving it because you are not going to make it multiply [Music] or you are throwing it into good ground yes yes away from the thorns away from the stones away from the birds and you are allowing it to grow watering dying doing all kinds of things so that you know your life success in the growth of that seed not just putting it there forgetting about it you have to nurture that series but don't dig it up let it grow hallelujah and say oh you know the seed that i planted in the ground nothing's happening to it yet push it back next day up again no nothing yet put it down nothing yet you know you won't have a crop like that yes it's not possible because you have to let the laws of god work amen hallelujah so if god says anything in his word you have to take it yes by faith amen yes amen and once you take it by faith all you have to do is walk you want to retain man don't worry about anything else about i'm gonna dissect this and see how this is gonna work hallelujah you know i prayed for my baby and nothing's happening it's just the same you have to have patience yes god demands patience amen and when you have that kind of a patience a man you find that like the farmer he plants an onion and it's just it's just one onion but from that onion when he waits about 19 90 or nine months nine months he has to wait for harvest i mean patience he waits for that and when he sees the fruit of his labors amen just by waiting what do you do amen when when uh the job that you prayed for doesn't happen oh you know i don't know what to do now what must i do because pray it was the only thing i'm told that would work but now i prayed and nothing happened now what to do now oh just apply again apply again and apply again amen and you know nothing nothing you just have to constantly by faith tell god i believe amen amen oh man that's watering now you're watching the series i believe lord amen though nothing happened yet yes like when you're let's say you have tb or you have cancer you find yourself in that the doctor said you've got cancer so what's happening now is the doctor is sowing scenes of discrepancy in jersey amen not that not that he doesn't like you because as long as you're coming you are going to give him something you are sowing a man without realizing you are sowing seeds into his bank account amen you are you are you are adding to his balance instead of adding to your faith amen hallelujah no i'm not saying don't go to the doctor hallelujah but i'm saying that add to your faith that god has done the work in your life amen amen nothing should be able to stop you from believing that that by faith you are going to receive what you ask for yes amen now the bible does say that if you ask you shall receive yes amen now it's as simple as that if you ask you receive amen so now how many times have you not received the bible said because you asked us yes you asked wrong amen now the round asking is when you want to place whatever you have asked for just for yourself you know i'm just i'm just gonna show them that what kind of a faith i have and i'm going to come here and just do what i have to do the best you know look at this we've got the best guitar human names or whatever they call it am i right amen is that the right word it's a smart guitar it's expensive you see when you ask materially god will give to you if you ask by faith but now sometimes you don't get what you have asked for is because you want to spend it on your you know your flesh amen and then when you don't receive it you say faith doesn't work faith works all the time amen faith doesn't have a flat factory amen faith has got a key amen faith has got the mechanics yes faith has got the dynamics amen every time you turn the key it stops amen all you have to do is put it in again there you go that's faith remember this and even if you forget everything that i've said here tonight remember this one thing that faith will never leave you in the lodge amen hallelujah united will always take you where you want to go amen remember that amen where you want to go faith will take you just go to the right place hallelujah amen by faith everything will work for you amen because remember we need what kind of a faith do we need to get out of this body rapturing faith yes rapturing faith so what is rapturing faith the prophet says it's based on divine healing yes so now you had a sickness and you maybe flew and the fuel flew away it's gone it's gone so you were once sick now you are healthy what happened the body has got a resistance amen that you don't even have to believe and then the body itself is a healer because it comes from god god amen god designed this body to do and fight if you must know what fight this body has right now on the inside of you every blood cell every black capacitor every red blood cell is fighting for your life fighting against viruses fighting against gems fighting against every onslaught that the enemy has to show you what happens amen the blood takes it away yeah hallelujah and that's that's easy when you are in christ the blood takes away every onslaught of the enemy you don't even have to do anything all you have to do is walk by faith amen oh i like that amen walk by faith so now divine healing and rapturing faith is the same thing amen because rapturing faith is the body change yes amen when you have a flu it's a body if you have cancer it's a body change your body changes from death to life amen hallelujah once you realize that the doctor said you see that there's a cancer working right there maybe in the lung or whatever it is and he says now uh this is growing and i can't cut it because it's going to take your life and when it's in the place maybe in the brain you can't take it out but then you start to believe and the prophet said never have a negative testimony yes regardless of the symptoms and the situation never have a negative testimony because that will bring you down and in the book of demonology we find that the prophet would come to a point where he says i'd like to teach you how to keep your healing after you've been prayed for keeping your healing amen you know that you have to fight amen every inch of the way like joshua and caleb they had to fight every inch of the way in the promised land amen so what is the promise it's the baptism of the holy ghost amen so when you are in the promise or the promises in you you have to fight every inch of the way amen fight your way to your health fight your way if your husband is wayward or your wife is wayward or your child is where you fight your way and you'll soon find them where you want them to be in christ but you say oh you know i'm the only one serving god hallelujah and i'm the only one praying in this house and i'm the only one yes be quiet quieten down and tell the lord said lord forgive me for being so negative forgive me for not having faith hallelujah like the woman washing the dishes she was washing the dishes and the man said you know to his friend at the bar he said to him i'll show you the real christian amen yes and he said you know now just imagine if she would have acted differently that night she thought well if my husband comes home tonight i'm going to show him a piece of my mind or something like that you know but she was a christian beyond anything that he would expect when he got home because he told his his friend let's go home yes and i'll show you a real christian amen there's no such a thing as a real christian amen any real christians here tonight amen amen my auntie's up amen hallelujah there's only two in you that's fine amen we need only two amen because we're two or three are gathered amen that's where faith is amen hallelujah i know you have faith but you didn't have faith to raise your hand you see it's by faith you do nothing else so she he goes home with his friend and she dishes up like she gives him egg or whatever he and the plate comes around and she goes back into the kitchen to prepare something else maybe the tea or whatever she was preparing and as she goes he throws the egg behind her against the wall and he says if this is what you're gonna give us we are not having it oh my gosh going from left to right and he's discussing and doing his own thing but she was just there saying lord if i have this alone singing a song oh my she was as sweet as ever no i don't think we have wives like that today i'm sorry but i don't think if i must throw my eggs but praise god he was a real christian amen she knew what this was amen amen it was a husband but he was he was not where he was supposed to be he is not at his post of duty hallelujah and she just kept on washing him and seeing the songs picking up the broken uh plates and eggs on the floor they wept at night amen that's right they cried because of the testimony of a wife amen that was true not to a husband she was true to christ amen oh my it was in the husband's spirit she was exhibiting it was the spirit of christ amen how did she do that i think amen hallelujah she didn't have anything to touch you tell you not if i press this button my husband will smile at me or you press that button he won't throw this around and i mean he's embarrassing me in front of his friend just imagine i'm gonna get him tonight wait till he comes to bed i'll have my rolling pin ready for him just waiting for him to shut his eye i'm gonna knock the bumps out of but friends she was not listening to what the devil was saying on the one side she was listening to by faith she recognized who she was amen and she recognized the devil in her husband and the devil enough in his friend yes she knew where she stood with christ oh yes amen so it comes to that point friends where here was solomon and he because of his wives that he took he made an idol every foreign wife she brought her own idol with hallelujah before you knew it there were so many idols in israel that they didn't know which one to worship yes hallelujah let alone the very god that brought them out of egypt amen that blessed and anointed david a man after his own heart and here solomon was rearing up temples yes gods to other nations when he died jeroboam took over when jeroboam took over they came to him and they said you know uh you were serving there and being the head solomon made you head of this that and the other he said go to the new king amen go to the new king and ask him uh solomon's son forget what his name was and ask him to make our burdens later so the king went and he asked he asked the uh the eldest what must he do to these people jeroboam and these friends and he said after three days come back or whatever time it was given and they came back and they said let's say it's the king because the king didn't listen to the old man he went to the young man you asked them and they said make their burdens harder so the problem was that the faith that solomon had was now rubbing or should have rubbed off on his sons but they went the other way and they built two golden cards so that's what can happen to this great king his faith to god that he said when he prayed when your people israel is in trouble when they face a temple let them be saved let them be delivered but the golden cows were not and they were being worshiped and god sent elijah amen and we don't know who and where he comes from but elijah was a man of god amen hallelujah he wasn't to be messed around with he wasn't the one that you could play around with amen because let's just look at that he was a tishbite from kashmir in gilead as the lord god of israel lives who i serve oh my god this is faith amen it's nothing to do with you know there's my golden coffin that's the one i worship can you see that's the one that's my god no you know there's my church we in the message my past is so and so but elijah came and he said as the lord god of israel lives whom i serve there will neither be dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word who are you with the king said who are you in any case where do you come from tishberg is just a small place we don't even it's not even on my map what you doing here who are you telling me that it's not going to rain you know the seasons are regular here in israel we know no problem look how our crops are growing and it's beautiful and we have enough wheat to feed the more than anybody you know outside our country but elijah said there won't be rain yes and not even impossible do hallelujah they won't be due for three and a half years so you see it the book of kings starts with solomon and it ends with elijah oh my what did your book start with oh man where do you start in the messages oh my mother is in the message she was born in the message so now that makes me in the message no he does not make you the message you must be born again amen because it's by faith for your mother and it's by faith for you yes amen you must be born again you must have a new birth experience and once that happens then only can you say hmm it ends with that that's where my faith ends amen in the word of god it ends with apron it might have started with ronnie but it ends with agent yes it ends it might have started with john my father and my mother about seven days adventist reunion but it ends with me my faith in christ hallelujah the god whom i serve hallelujah it's not about the god that my mother served or the god that my father served it's the god that i serve amen in the bible hallelujah yes so we have to look at those things and it's your faith it's not your mother's faith oh you know like they would say methodist my mother's faith is methodist that's why i'm a methodist that's not that's a religion it's recovery amen hallelujah so our religion must be by faith amen nothing else hallelujah you have to work your own salvation out with fear and trembling you have if you're not shaking in this message you are in the wrong seat hallelujah because when god comes on the scene you must be shaking everyone's shut when god came on the scene hallelujah but we come up with our heads high we come up as if we own this church we come up here man as we as if he doesn't say what i want to hear i'm out hallelujah then be out because you are out in any place amen be you you might be in but in your heart you're out amen there's nothing that can help you if you are not by faith because god is not pleased yes with your lack of faith you have to you have to abide amen and stay in the faith because you find yourself that when when you go out of faith you go into unbelief and unbelief will bring forth sickness worry and death hallelujah say oh we all die but you can be walking and be dead because you don't have faith you know that that your faith will make you walk be dead you're a dead man walking so may god help us my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of person so there's no respect amen to who is gay clothing now we're not talking about gay gay men we are talking about happy clothing gay clothing is something else in this world so we're not we have to like kind of look at those things um i trust that god will show us the right way people take words and they use it i came to durban the english that they used was swear words we used in pe hallelujah so we i thought really as a young young boy of 13 years old i thought well these guys are swearing in front of a youth but then i realized no it's it's a pure english word and we just use it mostly in the wrong way so you find like things in the message i always say this to understand the message you have to go with to understand the bible you have to go east yes hallelujah and uh to get the holy spirit you have to go on your knees amen it's by faith amen there's nothing else you can do about it and that's why we find ourselves in the situation of babylon because you know the prophet would tell perry green he says there'll be nine different interpretations to my message now you can imagine now when your pastor stands here and you go up there you find you will come back with contradictions to what your past is saying because of the confusion of babylon out there because every pastor wants to be on top of the other one amen one wants to be an apostle on that one and you find yourself that because i was in the message first you have to be under me and i get a doctrine that will be above you amen and find that all of a sudden uh there's a new doctrine and it will be nine different doctrines that will be against the doctrine coming from the pulpit so stay with the word amen that's all amen yes because now you hear thunders you hear uh adoption you hear seals you hear tent vision you hear all kinds of things and then you come back and you say that a thunder is nothing but the voice of god amen paul was a thunder it was the voice of god and that was the first seat that fell into the ground i want to close in five minutes have i got another five minutes amen my time i'm i'm not having my glasses on i don't have my watch where was i amen so where do you apply an individual's faith when you look at the pearl i'm closing now watch closely now the pyramid is faith right at the bottom and next to faith is paul yes but now climb the ladder a little bit further to luther and the prophet says the just shall live by faith amen so now faith and faith something's wrong amen but when you look back at the pyramid you have to take away the individual and the church ages with the messengers amen so now come back to paul again you say paul is the seed original have we got that amen amen paul is the seed original amen yes he's not just free hallelujah he's the cedar original now that makes a big difference and paul only had faith because that's the first kind of a doctrine that came our way that paul at faith irena said virtue blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and william branham had brotherly kindness nonsense can i say that again if paul only had faith [Music] yes he did he had faith but he had all the virtues because to get the holy ghost the poor and the holy ghost yes he did so for paul to get the holy ghost he had to have all the virtues simple because without those virtues including the holy ghost you shall never fall verse 9 in second peter one you shall never fall so whoever wants to fall payment will just be they'll have a lack of those things in second peter one up to verse it's as simple as that that's why we are falling so much because we don't have these things enough because we didn't add to our faith because we didn't go by faith we went by doctrine nine different interpretations but paul being the foundation seed or the foundation of the church amen of the gentiles let's look away from the israelites now jews we look to the gentiles where the bride starts and paul was the lion hey man anointing and then we look at the eagle anointing hallelujah which was william branham now when the lion and the eagle which was the greatest of beasts and birds yes nothing higher than an eagle and nothing higher than a lion king of the beast king of the birds those two anointings the alpha and the omega he's the beginning and the end hallelujah so the first scene has become the scene at the end no wonder they said brother brown he said we are resting on yes you preach what paul preached amen hallelujah so friends it's not another new revelation but it's the same revelation because our to be turned back somewhere amen yes so now we come to the place that what faith have we been returned to the apostolic faith amen amen the fathers amen of pentecost that or what they were the children then but now they are the fathers because we become the children amen of something that was not right we were taken from the name of the lord jesus christ so we have to come back to the faith of the amen amen so you see paul didn't only have faith that's why you can't connect paul to faith because luther had faith the just sheltered by faith so where do you run now amen because there's two faiths but paul original seed that seeded to die go through the dark ages come up as the first shoot in luther and that's where the prophet plays justification for the church not the individual no the church hallelujah the church age and when he plays justification for the church age amen come wesley sanctification for the church age and then the pentecostals had the shock oh that's where people miss it now the shock pentecost was there by faith remember they are part of the bride you can't take them away they led pentecostals yeah hallelujah made the bride for this day so you see it looked like the seed but the seed or the seed had to or be rejected by the shock and when the shock pulled away the seed was back there in a multiplied form so that speaks of the resurrection so the life that was there a man right at the beginning has gone through and has come up all the way through to this age and this age is now the enoch age by faith amen everyone is not down there but we are up all up here remember one seed goes into the ground and if it doesn't go into the ground it abides alone you see so when the team poured into the ground it died through the dark ages came up in luther came up through wesley came up to the pentecostals now it's here as living stones living seed and now the seed is being waved there was a wave sheath hallelujah and then wave chief told us there's more coming like this let's wait so that means now everyone that was there is not here hallelujah so we're just waiting for them to be materialized in front of us because we which are alive yeah shall see them amen amen we will see paul we will see william branham we will see we will see perry green we will see all those that passed on we will see everyone that we knew amen will see them because they will be changed amen from death to life again oh yes friends so paul didn't only have faith he had all the virtues he had faith he added to his faith and he had the holy spirit amen are we together amen oh thank you god bless you and we realize who we are where we come from and that's why the individual starts his faith there he adds to his faith and when he asks his faith god gives him the holy spirit god will only accept your faith if you add it to your faith all these things that we see and somebody said amen amen can somebody say hallelujah hallelujah [Music] so i trust that god will certainly bless you amen and that his mercies will go with you and i know that we're just here to tell you of what we know in the scriptures and in the message there's nothing new under the sun but it's those nine different interpretations of the message that we have to worry about amen not that we have to worry about all we have to do is go by go by faith in the word of god because the message has brought you back to the word yes it's not a new message it's the message that paul preached bringing us back to the word so our heart has been turned to the word of god it's that simple friends so read your word read the message and the message will say what the word says the prophet says if it doesn't the word is right amen amen as simple as that may god bless you there's nothing new under the sun it all happened it's going to happen tomorrow it's going to happen again what already happened amen so what paul preached we will preach amen and it's that faith that will take us up trust amen lord thank you and uh i believe we're going to have a few minutes of prayer amen and you can pray where you are if you want to kneel you can you can stand you can amen call upon the name of the lord and trust god that he will answer your prayer my free amen if you are sick thank you lord god answers your prayer by faith if you ask anything in his name remember he's done the work yeah he cried on the cross it is finished yeah there's nothing you have to do but water the seed that's held into the ground right now if it's fell in good ground you're a christian you've been a christian all your life you've seen a christian all your life and you want to be a christian tonight it's your turn it's your time believe and god will bless you hallelujah thank you lord thank you thank you father now let us lead in prayer thank you lord and i will just silence often go into my own quiet prayer amen heavenly father in the name of jesus christ [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] all long words of comfort replace the blood of jesus christ [Music] oh [Music] god you [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] i [Music] jesus christ may be honored lord [Music] [Music] is for something great to happen when it has happened already we pray [Music] in the name of jesus christ we pray tonight we pray oh god we know your time is your time yes lord we know that by faith we
