foreign amen she couldn't wait to come to church today amen but we pray the Lord will continue to be with us he's kept her for one year thus far amen by his grace he's kept her in good health amen we pray the Lord will continue to be with us amen amen and even as she grows in the ways of the Lord amen and also bless Karen amen who's taking care of the baby amen you don't know what it's like to take care of a newborn bring them up until one amen to Sarah's Gonna Learn amen Hallelujah it gets really acted from others but we thank God that he's given them a nature to be able to yes endure and take care of them amen hallelujah so motherhood is also an attribute of God the nurture remember God says like a and I gathered you under my wings amen talking to Israel then amen so let's start our scripture praise the Lord amen let's turn to Luke Chapter 2 and verse 26. Luke Chapter 2 and verse 26 says behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he would not see death until he had seen Lord's Christ amen amen may the Lord blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so it must have been something for Simeon being an old man to wake up every morning amen and go to the temple with the expectation that he was going to see the Lord's Christ something was revealed to him personally yes now if you go and do a study in the scripture you won't find a prophecy about this that Simeon would stand there and see the child it's personally revealed to him by the Holy Spirit and he is diligent to Akin unto the voice of the Holy Spirit now remember this was before the Holy Spirit was even released to the church but this man was so devout the Bible called him a just man a devout man he didn't Matthew his age he was found in the house of the Lord waiting for the promise that he would see the Lord's Christ amen amen and no matter how old he got they told him your days are drawing near Simeon why don't you rather stay home and we'll cook you a good meal he says no I have a confirmation in my heart that the Holy Spirit has spoken to me amen so I want to say that you and I like Simeon and we need to see the Lord's Christ in our lives amen so every day we ought to be looking forward to the manifestation of the Life of Christ in US amen we ought to be waiting with anticipation that daily we are growing into the stature and the image of Jesus Christ amen so here we find that he never wave it at the promise now the same promise was given to Elisha when he asked for a double portion anointing for the Caleb can I get a HDMI cable and I can project from you amen he was told that if you see me go in that chariot you shall receive a double portion anointing amen was that what he was told if you see me go so what was his job to do to keep his eyes fixed on the prophet he couldn't be distracted he couldn't look to the left nor could he look to the right he couldn't worry about the school of the prophets and what they were saying amen there were many voices in the land trying to distract Elisha but he had to keep his eyes on Elijah amen amen amen because if we had failed to do that he would not have received the Rope when it fell yes amen so if we go to Isaiah chapter 7 here you'll see that God prophesies things before it happens and there's got to be a people that are ready on the earth waiting to catch that prophecy and fulfill their part of the word and they are predestinated people not just anybody can grab a hold of the scripture and say that's my scripture yes amen amen if they are doing it they impersonate us amen but there is a specific group and there was only one woman that could say Isaiah 7 14 was her so look at this hundreds of years before Mary is even born the Bible says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign he's got Simeon there already waiting at the temple predestinated to wait there amen but here is prophesying of this child that Simeon is going to see yeah I'm gonna give you a sign the holy virgin shall conceive amen not an adulterous woman she's got to be clean living she's a virgin to the word amen the only virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel amen that there was only one woman who could meet the prophecy amen it wasn't going to be a 89 year old Sarah it wasn't going to be an 88 year old Elizabeth but it was going to be a young virgin girl amen amen God was not going to change all women and make a young again for this part of the prophecy amen she had to be a young virgin to the word amen amen so the Lord here is talking here and then you find also we're going to see in a Zion nine it says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor shall be called The Mighty God Everlasting father the Prince of Peace now who is this prophesying it's God speaking through the mouth of the Prophet that is going to come forth a woman they're going to come to what they say there's going to come forth a man on the Earth amen so for hundreds of years the script that the prophecy lay there just like how for thousands of years Revelation 19 later that amen the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready amen and that scripture laid their dormant for thousands of years amen hallelujah messenger out to messenger after messenger came but none of them touched that scripture amen no church could touch that scripture amen because it was waiting there for a specific group of people that was going to come to anoint that word amen hallelujah so we gotta find amen talking about the sun coming talking about the Life of Christ amen yeah now brother bran will talk about we were talking about Mary a bit on on Sunday and I just want to pick up from where we left off because we didn't get to read all of it he says that this type of woman now this type of church will have a virgin whom amen meaning that we won't have denominational seat come in there that we've got to get it out amen if you've got denominational ideas we've got to get it out he says what would she come out of a virgin whom the word what did Jesus come out of a virgin whom so like Jesus came out of your virgin room this bride will have to come out of a virgin whom amen which is the word right amen and he says then if God ever does anything in the church it'll be original back in the word again life is in the tree and it Bears its own kind amen Jesus wants fruit for himself his wife must bring forth the kind of children that he is bright children were children that's in the Rapture message now one of the last messages he preaches before he leaves the scene showing you now that Jesus has a wife and he's looking for her to reproduce The Life of Christ amen now and I ask you that faith is a substance of things hoped for right and I told you that this here the raw material that was used for this was with but what was the raw material used to make the worlds to make the heavens the raw material used was the spoken word amen the heavens and the Earth are established by the spoken word amen yes so if God ever reproduces himself again amen amen they must be of that same caliber yes amen because the spoken word is the Original Seed amen and if that tree ever puts forth another Branch again it's gonna be like divine by the power of the spoken word that's why brother Branham is preaching the spoken word is the original scene amen now we don't realize how powerful our words are amen I don't think that some of us have really caught what we are saying and then we are spending years and years and years and years in the message and not growing and not developing and seeing no life in us no fruitiness no manifestation in us and we claim to be the bride of Christ amen we have a false pregnancy claiming we are carrying the Life of Christ but never producing amen always telling people the doctor got the date wrong amen I think the doctor messed it up Hallelujah but Jesus wants fruit for himself amen let's do introspection let's see how we're producing The Life of Christ oh what what good it would be to spend 70 years of Our Lives serving the lord in the message of the hour never producing his life when he comes again he can't be United with you and then you are accustomed to all the darkness amen we must produce the Life of Christ and he's given us everything that we need to produce the Life of Christ the problem is the application the problem is that we don't want to take it amen hallelujah amen he says the people are afraid of the new birth they are so accustomed to the whole birth the old nature they're afraid of a new birth amen that's what's the matter they are afraid to be born again anybody knows that a birth I don't care where it is it is a mess if it's in a pig pen if it's in a straw stack or if it's in a pink decorated hospital room a birth is a mess even if it's in a messy Church amen hallelujah oh Church come on you ask yourself be serious now when last did you see her a messy butt in the message of the hour everybody is so Pious and so can't lose control and let the Holy Ghost flow so polished up so dignified yeah amen thinking that we have private hospitals to bring forth the Life of Christ let me tell you even in a private hospital that birth is messy there's blood everywhere amen so something is wrong if we are saying we are producing The Life of Christ and I think sometimes there's too many C-sections being performed you need to push we need to Perth you need to feel those blood pains you need to know that the Life of Christ is within you and push forth burst forth what what did the doctors tell the women work with the contractions those contractions are there to tell you when to push amen as long as you think those contractions are there amen and it's bringing you pain and you're hopeless and you're saying help me nobody say shut up and push with the contraction amen hallelujah people don't want to get messy he said but I'm telling you I don't want to meet God on my part how many of us want to meet God in our own righteousness let me tell you you won't even get a million feet in front of him you'll be consumed that's right on your own righteousness I don't want to meet the new birth on God I want to meet the new birth on God's level I don't care if I have to cry Squall speak in tongues whatever I have to do I don't care how many neighbors talk about me let me be born again amen I don't care what kind of condition might amen if I have to spoil all my reputation I don't have any anyhow that's one thing I didn't leave I have no Prestige or reputation I don't care what it is I'm ready to lose anything I don't know if you feel that way I'm ready to lose anything and become a fool for the kingdom of God's sake amen amen hallelujah I bet you off your friends don't know that you're Christian I bet you half your friends don't know you follow the message of the hour I bet you half your friends don't never heard about what God is doing in the end time I bet you off your friends don't know amen that God has sent us a mighty prophet in the last days to turn our hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers amen you know time is has passed so quickly brother Joshua that do you know the generation that we evangelize Phoenix for is already gone there's another generation maybe even two generations that still need evangelism amen in all that work we did there was a past generation there's a whole new generation grown up that haven't heard the message of the hour that I haven't heard the presently true yes we are just conscious thinking oh well we did all of that back years ago but think about the time span that has left let me tell you the generation that rejected the prophet he's gone old there's a whole new generation now that never heard about the name William Branham they've never heard that God sent a Prophets to turn our hearts back to the faith amen and let me tell you something the prophet I don't have to quote you but he says when you evangelize you since you get them before they are 25 years old he says once they turn 25 they become set in their ways hmm why do you think all of these people all political parties that are going for the Youth yes amen why do you think vgr is only going for the Youth amen amen they know if they get the youth they got the Next Generation amen hallelujah now what are we talking about that life the one that is prophesied in in Isaiah that the sun was coming amen the one that told Simeon the sun is coming the one that came to tell Mary you're going to conceive and bring the son amen amen now that was the natural Sun but he came so that he can bring forth his life in you yes right the woman that you are he wants to sow his word in you and bring forth his life in you now he says I don't care what they say I want Jesus that's how many objective on what level it is I don't care I want to meet him on his level not under what I think is right or what somebody says I want on What God Says is right that's what if he's if he said he's the same yesterday today and forever I want to see him on that level amen and yeah he goes on to say I if I have to preach a bunch of posts and eats all the crackers and drink Branch water I still want the gospel I want Christ on the level that Christ would come amen amen amen hallelujah and if you know that this message is not a watered-down gospel yes the standard of this message is absolutely His Eye Is Heaven because this is a message that has come down from heaven if you can live in the message of the hour I'm talking about really all he goes feel led in the message of the hour then you are foot to live in heaven [Music] yes because this message has come to prepare us to live in heaven if we can if we can obey the king's voice here on Earth then we can obey the king's voice in heaven [Music] thank you Jesus amen yeah he's talking about now we spoke a bit on this now he says now what will you do talking to Elijah he wants a double portion of your spirit to come upon me you know they had to walk to do a double portion not just a good warm experience not a good handshake good fellowship with the rest of the church but what I want is a double portion of what the best is I tell you what God says amen when God sets a man for a world task he has got to have something better than the world is God amen God didn't call you out of denomination he didn't tell you come out of there my people and lead you to nothingness he didn't call Abraham out of his land to lead him to nothingness he led him to a better life he led him to riches he let him amen hallelujah to meet Melchizedek so he's saying if he's calling you out of denomination he's calling you to something better yeah you should never think oh those people are operating in such a powerful anointing nonsense there's a more powerful anointing here oh thank you if you think they have worse amen Greater Works indeed shall you do Hallelujah yes amen amen if there ever was a time that a double portion is needed it's today in 2023 a double portion is needed and if you want the double portion amen it's today in the Realms of people something better something higher I think Beans and Cornbread is very good but sometimes I have to reach up a little higher materials is good but sometimes I have to reach a little higher the property saying amen you can't tell me eat vegetables all week the property is saying sometimes you've got to reach a little higher and now if you know that your expectation or that craving will drive you to get it you know a drunker he'll do anything to get his alcohol to meet that craving now if you're really craving for Christ what will you do if you're really craving for your spirit read a craving cream to work in your life amen what are you willing to sacrifice is amen what are you willing to sacrifice then he says I tell you when okay we do that we've got to we've got to keep climbing now here's where a very striking Point Israel was backsliding if it kept staying on the same ground cruising hmm we've been going in this one gear now you know why the condition of the church is where it is today he said they kept backsliding if they were staying on the same ground she has got to be moving on or moving back I tell you if you really look people have moved backwards people have really moved backwards and that's the way the church is and you know what they actually think they're fine they actually think they are fine just quoting quotes but no manifestation no life no evidence telling everybody that they are bringing forth the Life of Christ but like I'm telling you they are lying they're lying you've got two individual inspection they have no prayer life they don't read their Bible they don't even read the message of the hour they have settled for religion amen it wasn't but a few moments until he said you've asked a great thing but nevertheless if you see me when I go you can have what you ask now that has to be singleness of motive singleness of heart singleness of high keeping your eye on the promise now if you're sick this morning if you're Afflicted there is one great promise not by Elijah but by God himself if thou can't believe when you pray believe that you get what you ask for and you shall receive it amen amen yes thank you Lord now stop and think about what Jesus is telling us here if you really believe that you got what you asked for will you keep going back and asking him for it now if thou can't believe When you pray believe that your past has defeat that you will have what you ask for believe that the Deacon will have the faith God is putting it back to you yes yes amen amen religion has put it onto a man the priest the pasta keep him on this High elevated place but Jesus came to empower man amen amen amen now for many years we've had Ministries that built it around themselves right you look around you'll find it even here I'm talking about in the framework built it around themselves keeping the people looking up to you yeah that's not a true fight fool amen great Ephesians 4 what the true five folder does yes it's to edify the body bring them up into the statue of a perfect man let them see themselves in the world let them know that they can do the Greater Works what good would it be I can come here and do the Greater Works and lay hands and sick and people be healed and speak to spoken word and everybody just looks at me wow look what a powerful man he is and what where will it leave you same like a Catholic Church you come here weekend wake up bless me Father for I have sinned amen I'm telling you that the ministry is changing yes yes because we are in the final run and the people must make themselves ready and what he's trying to do now is to try to get our eyes off of man you appreciate the gifts because the year to Build You Up but you get your eye off of man and you focus on God Amen and where is god with him amen so keep singleness of I keep your eye on the prize is it almost time almost okay I mustn't forget that amen there's a promise if thou can't believe all things are possible to them that believe sometimes I look at myself now he has a prophet and look what he's saying brother Ramesh I look at myself and I've been such a jellyfish in my life I've waited and missed thousands of souls into the kingdom because I've waited there's a man who went seven times around the world calling himself a jellyfish trying for him to come home and he thinks he hasn't done enough [Music] amen Have Thine Own Way Lord amen let's see have that no way Thou Art the Potter I Am the place oh me and she needs after thy will wild sky and waiting [Music] and still one more time Have Thine always [Music] Thou Art the Potter I am the clay [Music] shake me after thy wings [Music] healed it and still amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen you know the Lord blessed us with new equipment if you notice that amen so we're just trying to be extra cautious now we handle them amen are we back on Amen and just tell me if it comes up here for the Caleb because every time he does that and I don't get it backed up back up okay so he has a man who went seven times around the world and he says Lord I've been a jellyfish I've waited Miss thousands of souls into the kingdom I've waited depended too much on it spiritual gift and said Lord if you will just show me and if you'll give me a vision what to do and God gives me a vision then I'll turn around and let somebody talk me into something else or I've never come to that spot yet until like I have at this time that I feel it's a faith that we must step out there because it's a promise and the things that he has done and the healings that he has performed and the Miracles in so much has come down and he had taken his picture by the side of us and so forth which has never been known since the world began and then stand around like a jellyfish it even makes me discouraged with myself it's time to keep your eye on the promise let me just continue with this so yeah the brother branham's wife tells him you need to pray for sister Wood's mother listen to what he says now on the road back my wife got all of me she said pray for Mrs Wood's mother I can't say as eating off her face I never since the word so alarm she's weeping since the word has been a hero of Faith since God healed a boy of a crippled leg and healed her with TB and so forth right they're at the room that night we prayed coming in Mrs wood said brother Branham we'll go over and we went to our mother which was in Louisville and she had cancer on the side of her nose and the doctors are tampered with it scattered it till it was just a little ring on the side of her nose and just about an eighth of an inch from my eye and just the bone laying there done eating it just as fast as he could eat in a way so yeah the prophet says he goes into the room and now Tom I want to speak to her alone and I go into the room to pray with the woman and while in the room I thought oh God if you just show me a vision of what's going to happen to the woman Mr and Mrs wood sitting on the outside waiting to see what the vision would say but while I was there I got condemned I was so condemned by waiting for a vision seemed like something referred back wasn't the calling what you need a vision when the promise is already been said amen amen yes amen do we need a vision to tell us that by the stripes of Jesus we will heal so what is brother Branham saying a gift a secondary the word is primary amen amen amen amen it's already written in the word the people were struggling in the 50s and 60s and it seems people are still struggling today if we don't realize the value of the words amen what you need a vision when the promise has already been said and that's why people ipn the court oh no we can't move because the prophet says we need that saith the Lord you already have that saith the Lord amen amen he says she has not saith the Lord or she keeps still now if we are saying say the Lord we can't keep still so I knelt down and prayed and while praying something just anchored inside on the inside the faith of the promise amen amen amen I come back out and Mrs word when I told her about it she said did you see anything brother Branham I said I never exactly seen anything but I felt something that told me that his promise was true and he was going to do it amen scriptural authority of the word of God and I believe that he's going to do it and in less than 24 hours the end of that cancer begin to break away and escape from over it cancers don't scare us you know unless it's dead so it was now and the woman is healed and home what a wonderful Christ by keeping our eyes on the promise God said so amen amen God said so but when we are prayed for sometimes we go off and say well it wasn't done just immediately so maybe we better go back again oh no keep your eye on the promise God said so that settles it amen that's all of it if God said so God is able to keep his promise or he would never make it how many times have you heard me say it's not our reputation at stake if God didn't want to heal us he shouldn't have wrote it in his Bible amen if he said land on the sick and they shall recover it's not my job to bring you to pass neither is it my reputation on the line the prophet of God says if I come here and I preach Divine Healing and I pray for people and I lay hands on them and they all die he says tomorrow you'll finally have to Pulpit preaching the same scripture on Divine Healing because it's not my word I didn't promise it it's God's word so he has to come up and back it up amen yes keep your eye on the promise that settles it that's all of it if God said so God is able to keep his promise or he would never make it yeah Abraham call those things which are not as though they were and for 25 years stood on the impossible because he counted God was able to perform what he had promised amen we are the children of Abraham by faith amen Hallelujah yeah he's talking about now on his trip to Africa here in South Africa he says there was a little baby that had club feet now this is how you prepare for the promise this is how you operate in faith one leg was shorter than the other it never wore shoes in its life horrible deformed I prayed for the baby that night and the next morning I went down by the shoe store I walked in there and there was a man buying the baby a pair of shoes he believed it like this man over here that believed that God would give him a baby sure he believed it was going to happen make ready for it I'm making ready all the no physical results seen as yet but that didn't make a bit of difference he believed it like Abraham and called anything contrary as though it was not if your mind if if your mind you say that that is the truth God is the Healer of sickness but there's not been a bearing ground in your heart Faith to fall in to express it it will not happen so I will tell you on Sunday always check when you are having faith is it still residing in your head are you troubled about it are you constantly worried about it or is it settled in your heart because this is where Faith Finds Its bending ground amen now the prophet tells us that God took his throne upon man's heart and Satan is where in the mind that's where the greatest battle is ever fought so never ever when the war is Raging in your mind check your heart if your heart is at peace then you know Satan is at work in your mind trying to bring doubt to come in he says you can't stop the crows from flying over the birds from flying over but you can sure stop you from roosting so you can't stop thoughts from coming into your head they'll constantly come but you can stop them from roosting when you have a negative thought maybe you have a lustful spirit and you're getting a lustful thought lustful desire maybe you're getting a worldly thought to worldly desire keep your mind fixed on the word of God amen thank you Lord now does the bible say that when you are tempted that you need to kneel down and ask the Lord to deliver you or does it say you resist the devil and he will flee amen you want the god to do the resisting for you when when you don't want to acknowledge the fact that you are a free moral agent and that free choice that God gave to you is depending on you to use your free choice to make good choices amen if you didn't have that free choice then you're being like a robot but God gave it back to you the choices we make in this life amen the prophet of God tells I said he looked down through time and he saw who would and who wouldn't amen so what caliber of sin are you carrying are you carrying the Fate seed of Jesus Christ amen as he really deposited his word within you and remember there was a time when the word was no longer in Mary but she had to give birth to the word that was inner and what happened when she gave birth to the word that was in her were the angels come on did Angels come and surround the birth of the child I Angels on the Earth right now amen hallelujah so there's got there's got to be a time when you meet the angel who says and you say beat according to me according to Thy word I am saying that is past tense in your life you can't constantly be saying be it unto me according to your word amen amen that means you never received the seed yet you never received it inside of you Mary you need to push this child amen nine months is fast since the beginning of this year it's time to push amen amen and God will give you a nice push gift I think only the young people know what push gift is for sunny I'm being told that when they push out a baby the one push gifts now give what's this foreign okay amen Hallelujah so I'm asking you the vision the dream the desire the hope that's within you faith has been blessing that within you it's time to push it out time to push it out you can't go overdue you know when when when you go over time the baby goes into distress some want to consider that they are pregnant some don't want anyone to know that they are pregnant some are trying to keep the baby in as long as possible but Jesus wants to burst forth in your life and Simeon is waiting there in the temple you keeping Simeon waiting hello Mary come on simeon's waiting at the temple the Holy Ghost was revealed to him that he needs to see the Lord's Shire Christ inside of you um amen now watch at the birth God was moving them from place come on all of this is coming fresh now sometimes your birthing place you need to move from where you were yes maybe that's your problem you haven't moved Joseph needs to get you on a donkey and move you to the birthing location amen the place where you were was not good enough for the birth of Jesus because Jesus must be born in Bethlehem of Judah so God's gonna move you and hasn't he be moving us amen sometimes you feel like I pushed you onto the donkey this year amen sometimes it felt like we were lighting a fire under you trying to move you because God is trying to get you to Bethlehem the house of God's prayer amen yes amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen don't matter amen so situations may not work out for you but the point that that there was no room in the Inn was already predestinated because God didn't want it to be born in a denomination yes amen God wants his word not to be found in a church building but the mange is now in your heart yes the word must be in your heart amen so when Wendy now with the Shepherds on the Earth Hallelujah I love this type of preaching where the Shepherds on the earth when Christ was manifest and won through the Virgin Mary there were shepherds there amen Shepherds were there ready to come and take the word amen and they went to broadcast it across Shepherd's realm and they began to tell others come and see did Angels appear to the Shepherds amen amen hallelujah yes angels are here on the Earth right now anointing the Shepherds of God to tell them amen that the Lord's Christ is here on the earth amen and I tell you it was only eight days later that they took the baby and Simeon finally saw the Lord's Christ now he says thy servant can depart in peace because mine eyes have seen the Lord's Christ amen yes you know you know you and I won't be afraid of death if you can see the Life of Christ in US Paul says whether I live or whether I die it matters not to me but to live is Christ and to die his game yes amen how many of us really want to push to that level where we see the Life of Christ within us amen I want to see let's stand together give the Lord a good answer before hallelujah amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen I tell you thank you I don't I don't have words for this but I'll tell you what it is he said when the Holy Spirit comes he'll lead you and guide you into all truth you bring things to your remembrance and you'll show you things that are to come amen amen [Music] he'll show you the present time the present condition and I I'm just saying now how God moved Joseph and Mary from one location to the next I'm seeing how the Shepherds went on the earth I'm seeing how the Angels were on the earth I'm seeing how that eight days later they had to present the child to Simeon amen The Works that I do shall ye do also great Awards indeed shall you do for I go unto my father praise the Lord your friend your neighbor your work colleague has been waiting for you yeah to show them the Lord's Christ Hallelujah praise the Lord oh praise the Lord praise the Lord the spirit is just telling me now that on the eighth day he went to be circumcised circumcision is the type of the Holy Ghost yes amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh I tell you the spirit of the Lord is right here right now and we can go on Amen but I think while he's here let's worship him let's Praise Him amen let's thank him amen let's be another Mary and give him praise now father we thank you Lord for the opening of your word Lord Jesus father the moon will look Lord truly we can say Lord even now the Bible becomes a new book to us Lord when we and Lord how the holy spirit makes it fresh oh God for us to see it in the word of God knowing Lord that this is not the intellect of a man or god father neither is it my wisdom or my understanding of the scripture father the Lord even now divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit these words will be uttered oh God to bring to Clarity in the scripture and Lord to bring it to light Lord the time and the season that we are living in even now Lord Jesus that father Lord there's such an urgency of the hour for us to bring forth the Life of Christ oh god father because Lord there's an expectation on the earth Lord for the manifestation of the Lord's Christ oh God somebody is waiting on the earth waiting to see the Light of Christ somebody else that they should not see death until they have seen the Lord's Christ oh God and Father we know Lord that the very Life of Christ will be seen in US Lord Jesus father I pray Lord that father you will come Lord and speak to us Lord Jesus oh we give you glory we give you all the father live in US Lord we need a double was an anointing
