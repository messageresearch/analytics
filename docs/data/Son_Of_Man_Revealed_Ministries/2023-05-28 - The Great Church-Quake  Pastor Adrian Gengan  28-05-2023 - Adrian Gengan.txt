struggling with the flu maybe and for the Jeff it as well amen anybody needs a touch from the Lord amen hallelujah oh bless the name of Jesus Amen Hallelujah amen the prophet says you're trusting the Lord for healing then you need to set your mind on healing amen amen amen focus on those scriptures and he said by his stripes we are healed amen amen he said healing is the children's bread amen

name of Jesus we speak with the authority and the faith of the Son of God in the mighty name of Jesus and I pray every sickness will have to leave every disease is gone in the mighty name of Jesus and we're speaking according to the revelation of our faith amen amen so the Lord has been doing wonderful things amongst us amen we were grateful amen those of you that to connect with us over the last three days amen you know it was the time of Shabbat and it was a great time amen we could just sense his presence even moving through that fourth dimension you may have heard of the testimonies or many healings that have taken place amen hallelujah and when you walk in the dwelling of Faith the supernatural becomes a normal thing a daily occurrence in our lives healings become a daily occur so we're not shaken we are not moved by the experiences we are standing on the word amen amen we don't place the experiences above the world it's because of the word that we are having these experiences because Faith covered by the hearing of the word amen so nothing will shake our faith in the word yes amen the prophet says if you experience whatever Revelation you had whatever experience even if an angel comes the pro the Apostle Paul says it says let him be a curse nothing comes above the word amen amen so if your experience don't match the word he says rather leave your experience alone remember some woman came to him and said oh the Lord met me and he told me I must go and preach he says yes I don't doubt you what experience you had but if you don't land up with the word then leave it alone amen amen so no matter what goes on in our lives always bring it back to the word amen amen start to confess a positive confession yes start to thank the Lord for it amen start to change the way we speak instead of praying and saying Lord Heal this person Lord touch that person start to change our language say thank you for healing that person amen thank you for healing them because healing is a finished work yes and Heaven has got to respond amen amen amen amen hallelujah amen listen to Matthew chapter 28 and verse 2. glory be to his name amen amen so remember this evening there will be a combined meeting a fellowship with all the Believers in Durban amen so we look forward to that time remember the Holy Spirit does not bring division amen amen so if there's a thought in your mind to bring division do not attend that's not the holy spirit amen the holy spirit is one that brings reconciliation the holy spirit is gathers everyone he brings them into one mind and one Accord amen so come expecting a blessing and you most certainly will be blessed amen without a shadow of the doubt I believe you will be blessed amen amen so this morning I'm going to be speaking I didn't finish my message last week so I'll continue on that thought because I believe some still need to catch it but also need to settle you into what Authority and power you have in this hour amen amen because it's really when the power and authority can be Unleashed in your life that's when Satan becomes powerless when you have a revelation of who you are amen so this morning I'm going to entitle it the great church quick amen amen you are the great church Queen before the great earthquake God's gonna shake the Earth like he did at Pentecost man I know you're still building your faith I know some of you can't say Amen right now because you can't see yourself as a church Quaker amen you know you know you get different levels of earthquakes maybe your level right now is one don't do much damage but I pray the faith and the Holy Spirit will come into your life you'll be a church Queen amen amen amen you'll measure high on the Richter scale amen causing division in Satan's kingdom tearing down amen so the great church quick amen hallelujah Matthews 28 and verse 2. praise the Lord amen everyone can hear me yeah amen I feel like somebody in the back can't hear me amen I want the neighbors to hear me even I want the Devils to hear me amen hallelujah some of them ran out the door they're sitting in the corner waiting for you to come back in the car but I need them to hear me this morning amen hallelujah and behold there was a great earthquake this is not talking about Jesus they put him in a tomb amen they try and put you in a denominational tomb try and put you in a message Tom saying stay there but the third day has come for the resurrection of the church time for the resurrection of the groom what happens when Jesus resurrects there was a great earthquake who caused the earthquake the Bible says for the angel of the Lord descended from Heaven amen as he descended now has he formed an alliance with us as he formed a partnership then there must be an earthquake amen amen and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and he sat upon it he possessed it amen he rolls the stone and he sits upon it amen so we see at the resurrection of the groom there was a great shaking amen let's turn to Acts chapter 2. now Jesus was in the Tomb for three days and on the third day there was a great earthquake Shabbat lasts for three days hmm the Feast of Pentecost lasts for three days and the Bible says when the day of Pentecost was fully come so after three days everyone following the thought they would one Accord in one place amen and suddenly isn't that his nature didn't we question our come this year didn't he comes suddenly and change things up yeah he comes suddenly isn't he going to come suddenly like a thief in the night so who is this the same one suddenly they came a sound from Heaven amen as of a rushing Mighty Wind amen May that Russian wind blow this morning amen and it filled up very first son amen can we get everyone in agreement here this morning it's Gonna Fill all amen not one of us is going to be left unfilled It's Gonna Fill all the house where they were sitting amen and they appeared unto them proven times like as a fire a many many men let fire burn up all our filthy language amen hallelujah get rid of that worldly tongue that swearing tongue and put the new tongue within you amen put the word of God within you amen you'll be surprised how many Christians swear even in the message make them angry yo they can talk languages amen even you don't know what language that is but while the language Amen Let the Fire of God come upon your town this morning say change my words oh God maybe you're only speaking negativity but let the fire of God come and speak positive things through your lips amen amen my sickness and my disease and my this and my unemployment and my this amen hallelujah you are exalting the devil that's right and it's set upon each one of them amen so they had to be in one mind one Accord and in one place it's set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost there it is again all filled and they begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen amen one more portion of scripture now that was the first outpouring amen they go a few days later and now they catch Peter and John and they throw them into prison and they're making railing accusations against them and they start to threaten the church this is the first time they are threatened now this is unknown experience to them because they were not thrown in prison before and you know when you threaten your life you start to wonder what's gonna happen these are new experiences for the church so they began to call upon the name of the Lord after these people release them and they begin to call on the name of the Lord and you'll read from verse 29 now it says and now Lord behold they are threatenings and Grant them to thy servants that will all boneless they may speak Thy Word situations will arise in your life that may try to silence your voice but pray for boldness Amen to speak in the midst of sickness to speak in the midst of trial amen you may be speaking from your dead bed sometimes but you got to speak the word amen what boldness amen how now if the first church prayed this way I don't know why people have changed praying this way hey yes you know we don't look for signs upon this we don't look at how they are praying how does you want them to speak to move by stretching forth and hand to heal yes are we another book of Acts amen are we another Pentecost learn how to pray Lord stretch forth your hand to heal amen amen that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus amen some say they don't want it they openly preach it we're not looking for those things so you'll never see it amen amen some say we have the opening of the world we're not looking for these things amen when it's the power release to the church it's a power to shut the mouth of Satan it's a power to heal the sick raise the dead and show the supernatural power of God Amen didn't Mark 16 say these signs shall follow them that believe believe what believe the word amen so if we truly believe the word decides follow us so watch how they pray Lord stretch forth and to heal that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy only child now if this is the unreasonable request the Holy Ghost won't fall but look what happens and when they are prayed the place was shaken amen where they were assembled together yeah yes another are pouring amen amen this is now not in the upper room they release a prison they gather together again the Holy Ghost can refill you amen amen you've got the same ones that were in the upper room and the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost you can be refilled as much as you need amen such as we have Divine unto thee in the name of Jesus be filled with the Holy Ghost and they began to speak the word of God with boldness amen you may be seated amen Hallelujah amen the great church quake going on right now you may be saying oh I don't feel a church quick amen you need to in order to feel the church quick you got to get into the spirit amen hallelujah amen if you want to be a part of the church quick you've got to get into the spirit amen amen amen die to the flesh yes we've been we've been preaching these things all through these months amen look at what month we are now at the end of the fifth month amen according to our Gregorian calendar but according to the Hebrew calendar it's the end of the third month why was Pentecost important after the first three months they had to bring the wheat Harvest and they had to bring the first fruits of that wheat Harvest and wave it amen it was the waving of the first fruits amen hallelujah in this year is their people amen whose life of his life who we can wave before the people and say this is that certainly have first fruits amen this is Pentecost not a denomination Pentecost means the whole outpouring of the Holy Ghost the prophet says this is that amen amen Hallelujah glory be to his name amen so we find amen if we look at the the Earthly meaning of what a earthquake is a natural meaning because you know the word church quick is a spin-off of the word earthquake amen what is an earthquake and what causes them earthquakes are a result of a sudden movement along Falls within the Earth they are dropping together of two plates but watch when a natural earthquake rubs together what it needs two plates it will lead to stored up elastic strain energy some of you already in the spirit you're not reading about earthquakes you're already finding yourself in a church quick amen it will listen but it takes two amen amen amen which propagate through the Earth and cause ground surface to shake because of a rubbing together of two plates internally Hallelujah according to the external manifestation amen amen hallelujah amen because of the ground surface to shake amen and may the Lord Shake us this morning amen if you are not being shaken then there's only one place being rubbed inside of you amen there's no movement inside of you earthquakes are caused because of a movement within the Earth amen so before amen we what does an earthquake does it causes Devastation it causes annihilation of everything around it but in this church quick we are causing Devastation we are bringing a violation to the kingdom of Satan yes amen hallelujah so we find we read that the Earth Shook and quit at the resurrection of the Son of God the Earth shook again after three days when they were gathered together in the upper room amen amen hallelujah blessed be his name amen Hallelujah let's go to that first slide there in the Saudi interest money in church age he's talking about Jesus he says Darkness Came Upon the Earth they put him in the Tomb they lay those three days and nights until an earthquake shatter the Gloom of night and he came forth they lay those three days a night until this Jehovah came forth Jehovah ascended on high then Jehovah returned to in dwell his church amen now it's no longer you that liveth only but it's Christ amen too yes that liveth in me amen so what it's going to cause then Jehovah returns to indwelley's church Jehovah came back with a mighty rushing wind and flames of fire amen Lord send your wind and send your flame of fire this morning amen yes going out my unbelief amen burn out my doubt burn out my fear yes amen people don't like the fire because fire does a thorough job amen amen how do you clean ship it yeah ugly sheep how do you clean sheepad I know we go buy it now modern days in the butcher already clean for those of you know you have to take all time put it in the fire amen put it on the cheap bed you ate sizzlings burning out everything yeah amen some don't the some of the sheep you don't want the head to get burnt this morning afraid of fire amen hallelujah you know we can handle the fire amen amen our brothers back there in Babylon walked in the midst of fire they weren't afraid of fire amen they wasn't calling for a fireman amen but the one the king of the fire came down the king amen came down that day he says come back with rushing Mighty Wind flames of fire Jesus came back to walk in the midst of the church and Empower his people amen if you're walking this empowered is because Christ is not walking in you Christ is not living in you Jesus said oh if you don't believe me believe the word should I do amen yes amen we don't believe in words we only believe in faith what did the Lord Jesus say if you don't believe me the word you don't want to believe the third pool what then there must be Deadpool Works amen amen [Laughter] oh my hey I know that might go against a message theology amen but as he was so is she amen if he had thoughtful manifestation she must have third poor manifestation she's life of his life Spirit of his Spirit yes amen hallelujah once more Jehovah came and this time to stay with these people I'm so glad he came back to State he went to amen but not to stay but he has come back again and again Jehovah heals the sick raises the death manifest himself by the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation who's doing it Jehovah amen glory be to his name Galatians 2 and 20 says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I yes the second plate now coming into action but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen amen difference now not faith in the son of God you're going to catch Mark 11 23 now when Jesus starts there by saying have faith in God the the real meaning of that is that the faith of God hello amen please catch us now amen we had another time another season yes this is third pool season amen yes amen I live by the faith of the Son of God yes you are not living by the faith of Ramesh of Joshua of Sunny of submission of Caleb hmm yes who's living in you amen hallelujah it's Christ Living in you the life which I now live in the flesh is still in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God amen amen amen that is why in Mark 11 23 when he says have the faith of the Son of God he says if you say to the mountain because when the sun spoke the literal son Jesus everything you have to obey so if you speak by the faith of the Son of God everything must obey amen yes there's no two ways about it Jesus says if you don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said yeah yes Hallelujah yes did Jesus say when you pray in Mark 11 23. what is that scripture put it at Mark 11 23. did he say when you pray or when you say I'm if you think pray and say is the same word um if you think pray and say is the same word if you know English it's not the same word Jesus does not come in Mark 11 23 and say when you pray when you say Amen amen too many times all we do is go to Mark 11 24 because we don't have the faith of the son of God I mean if you want to live in that anointing that's super Faith amen then this is the key now Galatians 2 20 and Mark 11 23 goes together amen go up 20 I think it is oh yeah maybe you did go there one more have faith in God now if you go back to the original translation have the faith of God right next verily I say unto you that whosoever amen yes we just read about you in Galatians 2 20. the one where Christ is living yes amen that's who can speak the one who came into sonship and Authority can speak that's whosoever shall say unto this mountain what is the mountain it's the hit it's your trial it's a situation it's your sickness it's a circumstance be thou removed what he says there whosoever shall pray to this mountain shall see be thou removed be thou cast into the sea I shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said amen God is telling you that you are backed up in this hour amen your word is backed up in this hour people don't speak people pray presuming people pray Lord if it's your will do this oh Lord but when Faith the prophet says when healing becomes a revelation to you when you know that 2 000 years ago it was already finished amen you start to claim it already amen you start to speak it as the finished word amen thank you Lord that by your stripes I am here amen and I'm bringing my body and this objection to that word body respond to the word amen yes amen whole another language now this sounds like high grade faith but you've got to train ourselves in this kind of Faith this kind of thinking you know the human is so negative it always wants to pamper the Flesh and speak negative always looking to the symptom but if we can get our eyes off the symptom amen and look to the Healer yes look to the one who heals the body amen the symptom has to come under subjection no longer pray Lord Heal this person Lord Heal the person Lord I Thank you for the healing of that person I thank you Lord for the Deliverance of that person I thank you Lord start to thank the Lord amen Heaven has got to respond amen yes my son my daughter the the there's no physical sign that that person is healed but look at their faith look at their confession and don't you know that he's the high priest of our confession amen what do you think he's doing you go read Amen in Revelation chapter 5 it's telling you about the 420 Elders that bows down and he says the the orders were going up and he says the oldest were the praise of the Saints so your praise are ascending to heaven now can you imagine this Pleasant secret cancer in the hospital no hope person dying there with heart trouble person may be sick to unto death put some sugar diabetes arthritis no physical sign but your prayer went thank you for the healing now the high priest has to take this before the throne the high priest has to take your positive confession before the throne yes and Heaven has got to respond because it's now that I preach he's thinking oh Lord thy servant on the earth is thanking you for the healing of cancer he's thanking you for the healing of autism amen and Heaven has a confidence here but but he didn't heal them now we've got to match their confession and bring healing to them amen change the way we think and don't be afraid to encourage one another let's pray differently let's speak differently come on let's change our attitude amen you know in the natural they tell you always dress for the job you want have the mindset for it amen hallelujah if you want a big office job level they were the big Executives you better not be wearing overalls every day okay train yourself for what you want that's right amen hallelujah Blessed Be His holy name amen we need to move on Amen in other words we're going to go into a part three amen blessed be the name of the Lord so what they say is because of the rubbing together of the plates it causes [Music] yes causes Devastation now they say according to science if you go and read up about it what can be done to prevent an earthquake you know what the answer is absolutely nothing all they can do is build safe for buildings you know you get earthquake hey that can move that would the rocking of the earth that building can sway they can try to lessen the effects of the earthquake but they cannot stop the earthquake amen also earthquakes are measured on a Richter scale and the severity of an earthquake is measured and it the smaller the earthquake the less severe it is sometimes you get a tremors I know a lot of people in Durban get excited here when they feel a tremors amen did you feel it shake amen I know all of you go back on a Monday morning and tell everyone at work oh it's shook in church it's really shook in church amen now they say a bad earthquake is about nine from nine onwards can cause real devastation nine there's a star falling from heaven but ten cause a real Church Queen amen amen yes 10 on God's Victor scale come on what caused the earthquake when Jesus arose yeah wasn't it an angel coming down yes amen what caused the church to quit amen wasn't it Revelation 10 yeah so in God's Victor scale he calls the greatest Church quick amen when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished amen so spiritually we are having a church quick when there is movement between the two spiritual plates within us amen our faith and God's word our spirit and the holy spirit amen two plates the mechanics and the Dynamics amen releases a super Church releases a superpower releases a super energy onto our Earth and it affects everything around us causes man causes annihilation you know we were gathered together on a zoom meeting and sometimes even when we pray in other circumstances what looks like a symbol ample thing you get back a testimony that this person was healed amen you don't see anything beside a prayer and a healing and a testimony we Rejoice but you know what we're not behind the scenes there was a great battle spiritual warfare going back and forth the power that leads in you amen so get in partnership with God in this time get the Holy Spirit cause those two plates within you amen your spirit amen together with the holy spirit let there be a friction amen then it will listen energy into you you will be a church quick amen amen amen amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen hallelujah Satan with all his powers and his principalities and his threatenings cannot defeat you yeah amen I've got good news for you good news amen touch your neighbor and say the past has got good news for us are you ready amen amen hallelujah Satan's an enemy right yes but I've got good news for you you are fighting a defeated enemy amen amen Satan is powerless before you Satan and his devil there's no match for you right now amen amen he was shipped of death hell and the grave at Calvary amen every sickness was paid for a Calvary amen a word released to us when that Mighty angel came down what was this the full opening of the word all Revelation put Luke 10 19 there amen all Revelation was given to us amen hallelujah or every Power is subject unto us in this time in this hour and the season amen a word was released to us by Revelation 10 a mighty angel came down with the open book when that book is coming down there's no more seals upon the book yes all the writers are being exposed yes in Revelation 6. amen every symbol has been exposed amen greater is he that is in you then the four arthritis amen amen hallelujah so it released a word full opening of the word then it's got to release a third perfect because the word produces Faith you can't have a third poor word and you're hearing that word and it not produce a Deadpool word faith listening to the third pool opening of the word can't produce a first and second pull faith impossible Faith cometh by the hearing of the word so if you are listening to a thoughtful word the full opening of the word it's got to produce a third poor faith in you even now amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord so your world is released to us to give us faith for Rapture and this Faith makes us an amateur God yes yes that's why if you say amen the god in the beginning said let there be yes did God pray or did he say amen amen did he make you in His image and likeness yes amen hallelujah because here beola give you power to thread on serpents scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing by any means shall hurt you amen amen that is a standard in fact that comes standard in every believer Hallelujah amen thank you Lord you should be a devil defeater thank you a devil Peter stop being a wife Peter and beat up the devil amen amen amen this comes standard pre-loaded factories precept amen when you born again I have given you did he did you ask for it I give you amen amen Lord you give me thank you for it right now Lord I Thank you for the power you've released to me amen trample on Satan serpent scorpions but now there's a revelation here I want to get to move notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but Rejoice rather because your names are written in heaven amen amen in what time and in what season did the book come down to reveal the names that were written in the book amen these disciples could not see amen that the seals were open yeah yeah yes some of you are catching it right now amen yeah Jesus is telling them Rejoice that your names are written in heaven amen but the name the opening of the book the title deed of man's Redemption only came down in Revelation 10. amen so only an end time people who's taking the book with all seals thrown off can now read the names back in the family album and he says Rejoice because your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life yes amen so Satan is powerless before you you know why I'm saying that Satan wants you to be like the most high god what is God like he's a Creator but but Satan can't be a Creator Satan is a perverter Satan is the story of true Satan is a corrupture yes the word devil means Tormentor amen Satan is an impersonating nature but he cannot create he waits for God to do something then he impersonates it Satan is like China amen they wait for the technology then they impersonate the technology but is Chinese Goods as effective as the original no there's nothing can beat the original yeah and the spoken word is the Original Seed amen if you say Amen spoken word is the Original Seed amen so what he say to now he was lasting after to be like God didn't he say I want to be like the most like God he wants to be a creator he wants to have creative power in his mouth but God Made You and I in His image and I am a true God so Satan is going into a meltdown he's having a fit how come you can be like God and he can't yeah even with his all his impersonation God Made You In His Image and his likeness so he comes and he's curious now in the garden let me see the sandwich of God who is higher than me let me see this amateur God In the Garden of Eden so what he starts to do Satan can only deceive he starts to deceive Eve makes us fall away from the word amen so he desire to be like God but God Made You and I in His image and right there I want you to give God praise right now and receive it amen clap your hands yeah maybe you didn't understand the point but you're an amateur God the prophet says you have enough power in your mouth to speak another world into existence Satan would love that power yeah but Satan cannot create but you can create amen so what the best you can do right now is deceive but the word says now listen to how the world is already there what's the best healing can do deceive but the word says the election not be deceived amen Satan it is written amen hallelujah amen he tries to bring amen fear condemnation reasoning but the Lord is will be released or free to us in this hour amen that breaks every chain of the enemy destroys the works of the enemy what is doing here the faith of this hour amen he brings sickness to the body thinking he can make a doubt in reason thinking we will forsake God Amen but there's a word already released by his Funtime here Satan he disrespected amen come back to the word amen it's also written if you lay hands upon the sick they shall recover brother you know that's a Jewish tradition shut up Bible if you land upon the sick they shall recover yes let me lay my hands upon you and cast that demon off of you you're bringing amen doubt and fear upon the people you're the one who's claiming oh I don't use that and uses about the spoken word not even a flea flies away when you speak hmm Satan is completely powerless they shall lay under the sick and they shall recover amen I want you to raise up to your true potential as a Son of God yes amen you if you say if you say Amen you or you have enough power to pray for the city yes you ought to have enough Faith to pray for the same you yes you sister brother that's why Jesus was God was embodied in one man and he couldn't do everything on his own so he went away and sent his Spirit into the church so there's many disciples who can go into the world preach the gospel amen cast out demons pray for the sick heal the sick if we are to do a trace back you can trace back or you can trace the lineage from Pentecost to now you got to end up now without church not just our church I mean but the message of the hour it won't lead you to you know I'm in the trail of the church and I'm telling you for too long you live with the mentality that there's I need to ask this person to pray I need to ask this person I need to do this yes no if you say exactly exactly have the faith of God Amen God is living in you quote Galatians 2 20 to the to the devil right the life I now live is not my own I live but the one who's living in me Christ dwelleth in me amen and now you need to apply this word upon your tongue when you're praying Satan I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen is no longer I that liveth but Christ said liveth amen so I say unto you amen leave this person yeah yes amen I'm sure aren't you afraid now the people are not going to look to your pastor what nonsense is that must you always go to the priest isn't that a Catholic system go before the priest make your petitions known we have one I preached amen amen the

to apply the word how to speak the word amen amen even in the quotes amen now here's the here's the prayer from the prophet we're not going to be too much longer maybe another 10 slides and then we're done our heavenly father in the sacredness of the service knowing that God that the God will ship is not an idol as the Edens were taken idle and fall prostrate over it of an imaginary God and believe that an imaginary voice spoke to them that he hypnotized himself into an idol I hope you don't think you're speaking to an imaginary God he says what a strange thing it is for the devil to do it do a thing like that when truly God is a spirit that he does not come into an idol he comes into living human beings and speaks his own words through the man amen you know people they do this they make these things idols they'll even go and pray but where's God living in me when you do that you are saying God is not in me it's somewhere else we don't have idols and things like this amen God comes in to living human beings and speaks his own words through the man and we are living is living images created in His image for his work and for his glory amen so if they want to see the glory of the Lord who must they see through amen you if they want to see his Works who must receive through you and if they want to see his image who must they see you amen amen and we see sick and Afflicted around us then Lord we feel we've let you down on the job there's something somewhere we need Lord give it to us this morning say Lord give it to me this morning oh give it to me this morning Lord when

morning we want you inside of us Lord amen say the Lord I want you inside of me we want ourselves out empty us Lord fill us with your presence humble our hearts and we'll praise thee amen that's a good quote to just bring that portion and print it and place it before you Lord we want you inside us we want ourselves out empty us out Lord amen you see remember we always say you can't fool us because we're so full of ourselves empty us out so you can feel us humble our hearts and we'll praise you amen he says and we see the sick and inflicted all around us now watch one more time our Devils will fly how you can be a church quick you need to break down the windows and walls of creeds let them come down and he says all superstitions and Devils will fly away things will change amen so yeah the prophet is telling us we read Luke chapter 10 verse 19 right how we gave them Authority power but then they came a dumb a man with epileptic boy and they couldn't cast The Demon out so yeah the property speaking these things and he says they could do it he gave them the power he says ten days later they couldn't cast The Demon out he says why couldn't we do it why am I reading this learn from it maybe you've been praying over a situation learn from it did he say I took my power back from you has he taken his power off of you stay with me now has he taken his power off of you no no when God gives you anything that's forever amen he didn't take it so when you pray that you see something not happen he didn't take his power from you yeah I can show you where God gave the church power to heal the sick now you show me in the scriptures where he took it away from the church give me the scripture it isn't there when God does anything it's Eternal when he give you eternal life that's forever Grim not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption um it was because of what your unbelief the reason you wouldn't cast him out because you didn't believe not because you didn't have power now to your Methodist lutherans Baptists Presbyterians message people the reason you don't do these things in your church it isn't because you don't have the power it's because you don't believe it yes that's all just because you don't believe it if you don't believe it the same thing would happen the Pentecostals don't own it all together why must the tears flood the works he says the Pentecostals don't own it Pentecost is not a denomination Pentecost is an experience amen amen hallelujah what is Pentecost he's gonna tell you what's Pentecost the Lutheran Pentecost the Baptist Pentecost the Catalyst Pentecost anyone who receives the Holy Ghost is Pentecost say Lord I am Pentecost I am Pentecost because the holy spirit is living in US amen it's

them if you are not called to be a preacher yes you'll get all mixed up and messed up and you'll get people Tangled Up and you won't you'll ruin them and yourself just live your sermon yes right we're heading to a point now the preacher's call to preach is to live it too if you can't live it then you stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons all right now this is the point we want to get to how can it be a church quick how can I shake Satan's kingdom he says all right here was voices all we need in Phoenix thousands of Little Voices the Thunder of God can bring out in sweetness and holiness Purity undefiled lives that's all the consecration we've been through now right walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that standards against the

the name of the Father the Son of Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit brought the true revelation of that scripture in Acts 2 and you have to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what is that Revelation amen right father son Holy Spirit not three different individuals but one being in three different manifestations so watch what the revelation of the word does to Satan and that's why if

the life that's in the blood Lord has come upon the believer this guy is getting too anointed for me let me relieve him and run away that's right that puts him on the move when you see the real genuine thing amen the life that was in the blood was God himself so it comes back upon you the Holy Spirit you become a Son of God with no more conscience of sin he that's born of God does not commit
