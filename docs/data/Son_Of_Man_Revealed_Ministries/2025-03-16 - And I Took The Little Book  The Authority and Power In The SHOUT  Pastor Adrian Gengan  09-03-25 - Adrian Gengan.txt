your glorious name oh God in the mighty name of Jesus we ask it with much Thanksgiving amen thank you amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen it's good to be back in the house of the Lord amen good to come around the revealed word of the hour amen and draw strength from it am hallelujah amen he is El Shai so we can only draw strength from the word amen and what a word has been given to us in this time and season amen so we welcome all our visitors amongst us amen how many if you are glad amen that we can come together even as we see the day fast approaching and gather around the revealed word of the hour amen let's turn to our Bibles amen going to be speaking from an inspiration where John takes the book and he says and I took the book amen and I took the book praise the Lord so we'll go to Revelation 5 and my inspiration out of that is that the authority and the name is revealed in the shout amen amen amen it's only in the shout that we have the authority restored amen Revelation 5 and verse1 and I saw in the right hand right hand is very important amen I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and they sung in new song saying thou are worthy to take the book amen what made Jesus worthy now they're saying amen and to open the seals this is what made him worthy thou was slain and has redeemed us to our God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people Nation notice that's the same group now that we are asked to prophesy again amen amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated we'll go to Revelation 10 and verse one praise the Lord Revelation 10 and verse1 we'll see this book now coming down to the Earth remember it was taken out of the right hand amen and this Mighty angel coming down now brother Bram is saying only Christ it could be it's not the Book Changing Hands it's the one who has the book changing form and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud you're wondering what cloud This Cloud yes amen and a rainbow was upon his head and his face were as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open yes so the book was closed in heaven the book is now open on the earth amen and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth there's a reason for putting the foot on the sea and upon the Earth if you read Revelation chapter 13 there's a beast rising from the earth there's a beast rising from the sea so he's coming to suppress those demon powers amen praise the Lord and then we'll drop down to Revelation 108 there and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went I John I the bride amen I the wife I the son amen last week we were speaking on the changing of mask just like how Christ changed his mask the bride has been changing her mask in the different drama in the different scene she's no longer just the bride called out she's the married wife amen but she's not just the married wife she's the wife reproducing The Life of Christ and it's only this type of person who is now an adopted son that can stand positionally in Revelation 108 to take the book hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen to prove that point Eve can't take back the book Adam lost the book amen so a son lost the book so because a son lost the book in Genesis a son must be standing in Revel 10 Amen to take back the book yes praise the Lord amen amen and the voice speak unto me again said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said give me the little book Hallelujah when you know it's yours you go back and you say give me the little book yes amen and he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations and tongues and Kings before we move on I want to show you why prophesy to these nations tongues and Kings amen because in this book have names hallelujah amen is this the title deed of redemption so in this book has names so the one that is asked to prophesy again he asked to call those names which are in the book amen hallelujah am amen I need you to get into an atmosphere this morning I need you to forget about what happened at home I need you to get into the spirit of the service amen hallelujah so in this book of names and the one that is asked to prophesy again must call those names in the book praise the Lord so Revelation 17 and 15 will tell you why we are asked to prophesy to Nations tongues and kings and he says the waters which thou sawest where the horse sth and of peoples and multitudes Nations and tongues so the S is trying to suppress it's sitting upon Nations tongues Hallelujah but we are asked to release a word of Prophecy amen yes now remember what I said the book is not changing hands the one who has the book is changing form now if you progress that thought he is there Seated on the throne God Almighty he's got the book in his hand in his right hand and then the lamb comes forth from the sanctuary that is why they couldn't find Jesus amen the high priest had to go into the holiest of holies so for seven Church ages Jesus was in the Holy Hest of holies amen making intercession so when they were looking in heaven they were looking in the earth beneath the Earth they couldn't find Jesus because nobody could go into the holiest of holies they had to wait for the high priest to come back out again amen so at the end of seven Church ages the high priest is now coming back out again to give witness that the blood that he sacrificed and shed had been accepted can somebody say Amen am that is why they say you are slain and your blood has redeemed us amen so the the book is now changing not changing hands changing form the lamb is coming to take the book then we find in Revelation 10 the mighty Angel which is Christ it's the same Lord Jesus changing form amen yes it's a mighty Angel Amen brother brandom says he had Swift Back Wings amen hallelujah amen amen hallelujah but then what happens in Revelation 108-111 is he still changing form oh come on somebody get this it is Christ now in bright form right amen amen so who is really taking back the book it is Christ in me the hope of glory amen therefore I can stand positionally upon the Earth he is now Christ in bright form taking back the title deed to man's inheritance and we know brother brandom is saying when the seals were open that was now opening up man's inheritance Hallelujah everybody amen okay amen amen so brother brandom is going to tell us what right hand means right hand means power and authority amen he says this in Hebrews chapter 1 he says what does right hand mean right hand means power and authority got the authority of everything in Heaven and Earth and all of heaven and earth is made by him hallelujah thank you Lord amen I want to tell you something amen you may agree with me or you may disagree with me but it's the word of the Lord because I'm going to challenge your thinking now man was given the Earth can you say Amen to that amen let's put it up Psalm 115 praise the Lord amen amen while we here we might as well get to it amen you can get to verse I think it's maybe around 12 13 somewhere around there but it's to the letter part okay we know that he will bless us let's get to the next one amen next one maybe 15 even right you are blessed of the Lord made Heaven and Earth amen next the heaven even the heavens are the Lords but the Earth had he given to Children of Men amen amen yes amen so the heavens belong to the Lord but the Earth he had given to Children of Men that's why he created a man in His image and likeness and said have dominion over the Earth but I want to show you that you are unique people when Jesus Christ arose and he ascended on high he said all power in heaven and earth yes is given to me Hallelujah that's the bridegroom that's the husband says all power in heaven and on Earth so we go beyond this because he didn't just keep it to himself but what he reclaimed he says I now give it to you if you read that quote again brother amen you see what the prophet is saying here he says right hand means power and authority got authority of everything in heaven and and Earth and all heavens and earth is made by him now when this bride overcomes this age what does the the promise say to you that overcome I will grant that you sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and sat down in my father's strong so I'm saying that this bride this wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen a words are not just effective on the earth because whatever you bind on Earth is bound in heaven am and whatever you loose on Earth is Loos in heaven oh come on the authority has been given back to the church when you speak Heaven responds Hallelujah when Daniel spoke he had one prayer and Heaven dispatched Angels though there was resistance amen but Heaven dispatched Angels immediately when a son and daughter of God a man was connected Amen Hallelujah to the Holy Ghost when he speaks his word is a powerful in heaven just like Jesus word amen if you don't believe your your word is as good as the father's word then Redemption means nothing he came to make us amen ears of the father joint ears with the son now how many of you have a joint account and you draw less than the other person Amen brother rames brother Tyson you got a joint account in that account is 100 million can you to him it's a joint account you both have access to it can brother rames dictate to brother Tyson you can withdraw how much you need no it's a joint account now if brother Tyson is drawing sparingly whose fault is it is it brother rames fault if brother rames is drawing sparingly who fault is it amen so brother Brandon is saying that the church is living beneath the Privileges she's too afraid to take back what was rightfully given to her and the the reason for that is because we don't realize the access that's been open to us under the shout amen the shout opened up a dimension to us amen amen the shout opened a dimension to the bride it's a door that's open to us it's a realm that's open to us amen praise the Lord and now in Genesis chapter 4 just want to read this one point here genes sorry maybe not Genesis maybe Exodus chapter 4 Exodus chapter 4 praise the lord it's actually Exodus I wrote Genesis there and Moses said but behold they will not believe me nor aren to my voice for they will say the Lord had not appeared unto thee they can still challenge you today and say that you claim hey man if this is not working maybe the battery is getting a bit lower amen what we can do is maybe change his battery or it's fine it's coming back slowly there's power being restored to the church if they disputing that you are the ones that has the authority because look at what Moses is saying now they may not believe me and not aren to my voice if somebody asked to prophesy again amen am yes praise the Lord but they may not believe you follow the point now they may not believe you neither may they AR to your voice Hallelujah then what he says they may say that the Lord has not appeared unto me they may tell you that the Lord has not appeared unto you they may dispute that the Lord has appeared to you Hallelujah yes they may tell you the Lord has not appeared to you they made dispute that you amen that you have not heard the voice of God and the Lord says what is that in thine hand amen I am asking you what is this in your hand what have you really taken back from the angel so they may dispute this they may dispute that you heard something but show them what you have amen hallelujah what is that in your hand amen praise the Lord and he said a rod I say the open book I say title deed amen hallelujah but they can't see it for too long because John goes immediately to reclaiming his rights the book was lost by eating Eve lost the book in the Garden of Eden by eating of the fruit so rather than keeping the book outside the book has got to get inside amen yes Lord praise the Lord amen I'm in the message I have all the message books that's on the outside Hallelujah but are you sealed on the inside amen amen with your flesh you can carry the message book with your flesh you can say I'm in the message but I need to see that amen move on into the insides and the message have an effect on you where you become the Living Word where we are the manifested word it's no longer just a profession but it becomes a life Hallelujah amen somebody give God praise amen hallelujah I'm asking you what is in your hand John takes the book and book amen that eating is a symbology in the in the Book of Genesis Eve ate of the fruit and and she gave to Adam to eat we know that was a sexual act because that is a symbology in the Book of Proverbs it says an adulterous woman eateth wipes her mouth and says I have done no wrong right amen praise the Lord so what is really happening here when John is eating the book somebody tell me they coming into Union Yes somebody tell me that seed is being put into the bride seed for reproduction of life amen the word coming into you is a seed for reproduction of life amen hallelujah then there's got to be a growth stage for the son to come to maturity under tutors and guides but when now he's in full Authority when he's accepted by the father amen the voice comes and says this is my beloved Son here he him amen that's what you see there in the last part of Revelation 1011 the son come to maturity and when the Lord is asking the nations of the earth to hear this prophecy coming out of this bride he's asking Nations tribes and Kings to hear he her Am Lord amen God won't ask the nations of the earth to hear your prophecy if he's not thoroughly convinced that you can handle the authority because the son that comes into position has the authority of the father amen who he fires is fired who he hires is hired he can withdraw from the bank account amen hallelujah he can take care of father's business I say we get about to taking care of father's business amen don't you know that I must be about my father's business amen hallelujah make the father's business your business amen make the father's will your will make the father's purpose your purpose make the father's passion your passion amen hallelujah oh we give God praise we give him glory this morning amen hallelujah amen we get too caught up in the things of this life amen but I want to say that the Church of Jesus Christ the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen who has reproduced his life the son now standing he's perfectly positioned in Revelation 108 to11 to fulfill the father's prophecy yes amen yes Lord we are not standing in Revelation 108-111 as the bride who is not married come on now yes we are not standing there like Esther walking through the palace afraid to get into the holiest of holies she's Queen yes she's got the garments but she's walking around the palace doesn't know what to do with promise until a thundering voice cries out to her Hallelujah and says who knows whether you've been called for such a time as this you w't called to walk in the outou of cour you w called to be in the Holy amen holy place you are called to be in the holies of holies so take me to the king yes Lord thank amen that's why this wise virgin needs to progress from walking with a lamp light in leosa because Matthew 10 amen Matthew 25:10 says a door was opened amen and she was pulled into the marriage amen those that were ready were pulled into the marriage amen so watch our confession if you still confessing you're the wise virgins walking around with lamp light he says lamp light you can't use artificial light in the presence of the sunlight amen oh thank you amen and this is the progression of the Bride she is changing mask yes once we were the wise virgins with oil in our lamp but that was good for the church ages now it's the bright age and in the bright age only one light will last it's your kind of Glory light we can't go into the Hest of holies without lamp light and impress the Shak Glory light he will not be impressed he will kick out that light and you say that was good for all the ages l oh glory be to his name amen this is the age of where our impossibilities become possible amen God is putting his name on you God is putting his stamp on you and saying you are the the voice on the Earth right now you are the ones who carry my authority Jesus won't leave the heavens and come down to the Earth to do anything if he's going to do anything it'll be him doing it through your body because Jesus don't have eyes but your eyes Jesus don't have feet but your feet Jesus don't have ears but your ears Jesus don't have a mouth but your mouth amen praise the Lord wonderful God Matthew 17:19 the disciples come to Jesus and they can't cast out a demon yes sir amen I want to show you we are not positionally placed now where demon powers are resisting us every demon power must bow when we speak we carry an authority but you've got to know that you carry this Authority and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief you're living in a realm amen where there's no faith yes because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as the grain of a mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove ends To Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you what kind of faith faith he says now now I I'd like to believe that we as the church have progressed from M Seed Faith we can't have this message of the hour and be walking around claiming we got mid Seed Faith this is the entire book of The Plan of Redemption the Seven Seals brother Bram says amen this blessed revelation of the Seven Seals has been opened up to us a new land opened up to us so how can we now walk around with mustard seed free come on church we are to have a great of Faith amen yes Lord we can't be flying in low dimensions of Faith amen amen then that eagle is is is got a problem amen do you know the eagle in the valley is going through a time of renewal that's right amen maybe you're moving in low levels of low levels of faith I'm telling you amen strengthen yourself you weren't born for the valley you weren't born for that point in your life yes sir you were born to S up there hallah praise the Lord amen so I'm saying Jesus is saying if you have the faith of a mustard seed I'm saying come on church Faith is measurable Jesus said oh you have little faith and then he said I've never seen such great faith how do you want to be measured in the kingdom of God amen somebody with little faith a Mustard Seed Faith but look what a Mustard Seed Faith Can Do move a mountain he says and nothing shall be impossible to you so I'm saying at the opening of the word when perfect faith is now been preached into us and perfect faith is arising out of us nothing shall be impossible to you praise the Lord sir amen so part of my point is to tell you know what we have taken taken back know what we have eaten amen then the authority and the name is revealed through us if we don't know that we carrying the authority amen then something is wrong praise the Lord it says now Jesus also goes on to say the next verse there how be it this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting now clearly we've evolved because people people don't fast and pray do you think Jesus has an expectation of us to fast and pray let's see quickly just to get this point Matthew 66 but thou if thou prayest what is Jesus expectation when thou prayest know me you know me and Jesus be like this yeah if you're like this then you're far apart me and Jesus were like this my thoughts even before I speak he just knows Jesus is saying when you pray amen hallelujah hallelujah enter into your closet some people like to make loud prayers do you know some people pray better prayers here in church than at home because yeah is the publicans yeah is out in the public they pray long prayers here even God is here say he I never knew this guy can pray like this you at home he just says bless me Father for I have sinned and he goes to bed amen praise the Lord so let us not be like the Pharisees now my point is to show you Jesus expectation is for us to pray he says when thou prayest enter into your closet shut the door pray to your father which is in secret and your father would see it in secret shall reward you openly drop down to verse 17 there and see about fasting as well because message people think they don't know to fast but thou when thou fastest Hallelujah so the expectation of the of the husband is fast and pray Hallelujah let's move on that was just by the way and when you're fasting and praying don't go tell everyone me I'm fasting e hey me I'm fasting Jesus says you see people would like to walk around with go back brother with dry hair he says put oil in your hair anoint your head and wash your face don't walk around so feeble what's wrong I'm fasting man you want everyone to be sorry that you're fasting amen hallelujah these things are to be done in secret praise the Lord let's move amen so believing the promises of God which is the word of God is opening up doors to us opening up Realms to us amen Heavenly placed DMS yes Shar Dimensions amen doors that we didn't know existed before Jesus is teaching us that nothing will become impossible to you if you can believe amen hallelujah amen now we know in Luke 137 nothing is impossible with God but if he saying nothing is impossible with you then what level of PL does that put you in amen hallelujah is he sharing something with you is it giving you access to a dimensional door hallelujah thank you Lord praise the Lord now we know it's because of the Cross and what he achieved and he died he he buried he rose again all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto him but what he redeemed he didn't keep to himself let's find it here the prophet is saying what does title did now you know in the in the breach he's basically speaking about the seven seal book and he's speaking about our inheritance Amen on Wednesday we spoke about what that book is it's our inheritance he says it's legal possession to that abstract deed title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost the possession of that deed thank you Lord now we can't be saying that Adam could speak to the winds Adam could speak to the waves Adam could speak this Adam could talk to the animals brother brandom is saying that the possession of this book means that we possess everything Adam and Eve lost but as long as we walk around without the ability to speak without the faith to operate the word amen hallelujah the word must be mixed with faith you can't take the word alone you got to mix it with faith otherwise you wonder like the children in the wilderness 40 years you're wondering 40 years you're wondering do you know it was supposed to be a 3 days journey yes Hallelujah but what stopped it they unbelief they didn't mix the word with faith how long are you praying over your situation how long are you praying over your problem I'm asking you let's reexamine the situation let's re-examine the case amen have we been wandering around this Wilderness for 40 years and having no breakthrough praise the Lord amen this is the point I also want to get to in Revelation chapter 5 he says is the title deed of redemption this seven seal book it's a title deed you wait till we get into those seals he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people yes he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us now remember what Jesus inherited he inherited Heaven and Earth can somebody say Amen it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed it but instead of keeping it himself he gives it back to the people that's his love for us somebody ought to praise God for that amen amen amen now Wednesday we were trying to tell you and I'll condense it to tell you that an inheritance is given for continuity and inheritance is not given for you to squander it amen when somebody leaves you an inheritance that's your privilege it's not a right you as a father if you own Al's wealth land you you you are not obligated to leave it to your son though they possess your legal name it's your right who you want to leave it with so an inheritance is left for continuity all that a man labors for works for is for continuity he builds up for the next Generation so that they can live off the fruit of his labors amen amen so in inheritance is not meant to be Grievous the The Inheritance is meant for you to better your life it's meant to be a blessing to the one who's going to be a recipient of it thank you Lord and the ones who receive the inheritance must live in The Inheritance amen yes amen amen now Matthew 25 remember now the end of the story The talents how does God measure faithfulness by what we have done with what he's given us the one who did nothing with what he has given us he said binding maned foot cast him into out of darkness and I was tying that with one point in particular I was telling you you can't do nothing with the message that's been given to you right you can't come back when the Lord is coming back and asking you what have you done with this word you can't quote back the word of God behold you sent me Elijah the prophet I know I sent you Elijah the prophet in fact in Malachi 4: 5 and 6 I am talking to you I am not talking to William Brandon amen I am telling you I will send you Elijah the prophet so how can when I come back you telling me that you sent me Elijah the prophet which means you've done nothing with the word amen what is he expecting when he comes back he's expecting the end result of Malachi 4:5 and 6 he's expecting your heart to be turned back to the faith of the fathers so when he's coming back and he tells you what have you done with the word you must say praise the Lord you sent me Elijah the prophet and my heart has been turned back to the faith of the fathers praise the Lord you sent me the message of the hour Lord and now I didn't just receive the word but I am the word wonderful when he gives you the revelation of the word yes Lord when he's coming back he's not expecting you to give him the revelation of the word what is he expecting I won't put you that up I am the word made flesh today he's expecting a man estation of the word God doesn't want you to give him back the revelation of the word God wants you to give him back the manifestation of the word amen thank you amen because when God said let there be light he wasn't expecting the word to come back like a rebound let there be light let there be light he was expecting light to come back so don't be impressed with people's revelation of the word tell them I want to see the manifestation of the word amen I'm glad I'm glad brother that you have the revelation of the word but amen I'm Looking Through The Eyes Of God and I want to see the manifestation of the word amen we've been too impressed with preachers amen who have the revelation of the word I say give me the manifestation praise the Lord amen amen because this word is to sustain us now I'm saying this is our inheritance and Adam was asked to multiply it and replenish are we multiplying the word of God is the word being multiplied daily Our Lives amen are we a fruitful Vine amen oh somebody give God praise amen amen amen so it's a it's a privilege to have this open word it's a privilege to have the inheritance it's not it right so Lord we thank you for this privilege thank you Lord an honor that you would think of me imagine you sitting there and you you have the reading of the will now remember also not everyone is called to the reading of the world am only those whose names are in the book to the reading of the will interested parties can't come there wonderful amen just because they want to see what you got they are not they must sit outside that's right amen hallelujah praise the Lord Lord amen so interestes can't come in only those whose name are in the book can come into the reading of the will praise the Lord and if you're a wise son T right when you go out you don't tell everyone hey this what I go out you know what they're going to do after them they're going to scr of you what's the thing a leech try and suck your blood praise the Lord amen amen so he allowed us now the shout this Dimension remember what is a shout a message going forth to gather the living Saints right amen now I'm afraid people have been claiming to be having the shot message but living physical natural lives defeated lives yeah the shot put you into the realm of the supernatural amen come on now Church the Shar puts us in another realm we are not like the people of the world we may be in this world but we are not of this world Amen I'm not the like the the next guy the neighbor here both of us may be going to the same place the same office the same work doing the same job the difference is he's going there Amen in the natural realm but I'm going to the same work the same job in Heavenly places I'm walking in my position I'm walking in my authority people may be shopping in checkers like you amen but they are shopping in the natural realm but I'm shopping in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus praise the Lord amen hallelujah so he's allowed us now access to the supernatural realm amen and and to believe means to have brother brandom says you ask anyone on the road you believe he say yes he believes amen but you really must have faith and perfect Faith opens up this dimension of the [Music] supernatural like I said we shouldn't be walking around in Mustard Seed Faith now amen we ought to be walking around with perfect Faith amen it's a world that nobody knows nothing about let's see what Jes what kind of world Jesus lived in amen praise the Lord Jesus lived in a world that no one know about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God when he spoke to them they say this and they and then they said you talking riddles we don't understand this you know when you talk the message of the hour it's encoded language to them that's right when you say behold I send thee Elijah the prophet they can't understand a word you are saying don't get fascinated with their tongues when you speak you're speaking in tongues to them they can't understand the bride's language they can't understand about a mighty Angel they can't understand about amen seven angels in a cloud they can't understand about the pillar of fire they can't understand about water baptism it's encoded language praise the Lord yes so he's saying they can't understand Jesus how can this be see there wasn't in the world he lived in now I'm saying we can't live in a separate world than what Jesus lived in I'm saying he was living in the realm of Faith he was living in another dimension on the earth you see the the problem will be if you think dimensions are far away brother Bram is saying if you pick this up and rejected King he's telling you that when he went beyond the curtain of time he said it was just a slanted Dimension he said I was standing here I could see my body he didn't say I was thousands of miles away and I took a a I looked I grabbed the abble telescope and I looked back on the earth he didn't say that he said I saw my old body there my hands behind my head it was just here another dimensional way just you praise the Lord amen so Jesus lived in this world what do you think happened when Peter was calling out to him to come on the Water Peter was there in the natural realm Jesus was in the Supernatural realm walking on water praise the Lord amen so then he stepped onto Jesus ground that's right Peter stepped into the supernatural realm amen so he walked on water am amen praise the Lord thank you Lord let's see they wasn't in the world that he lived in they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him he was a Mystic to them with his perfect Faith now he brings it down to us if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are we'd be a Mystic to the world the people won't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do that's the way it's to all all believers they were Mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves so when a man lives by faith walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bright material you're getting into rapturing condition now this means for each one of you not just the pastor deacons trustees this means for the Ley every individual walks in a world with God Alone amen yes hallelujah amen and I'm going to say this amen sometimes you walk in a world alone that even it doesn't doesn't mean that you're living in the same house that the next person understands the world you live in come on now nobody know this is an individual walk you could be walking in ey dimensions of the Holy Ghost that they know nothing about but they just see you as the same old same old amen praise the Lord I know I know the opposite is much more true amen sometimes you OPP is much more true that's why you can't say Amen praise the Lord I am saying that we are to be living such lives brother Bram is saying we live in a world that nobody knows nothing about we live in a world with God Alone amen hallelujah in this Supernatural world we don't just share our experiences right this these things are sacred trust given to you am there are some things that you can't utter to the next person there are some things that I'm meant to be kept brother Bram says I'll have to take this to my grave what is it experiences with the supernatural because he learned under the first two you explain the gift too much so just because you're the daughter at home doesn't mean your mother understands the world you live in praise the Lord just because you're the father at home doesn't mean everyone understands the world you're liveing amen but that will create problems if the family is not United they'll see you as a nut they'll see you as a crank they'll see you as an OD ball amen praise the Lord hallelujah you're baptized into this kingdom and there's your mother there with you your wife there with you who's there with you brother Jaden what's brother brandham saying who's there with you nobody so how can they explain to you experiences you having amen if you are the only eye witness come on now this is for all of you amen nobody else in there but you and God he gives out the orders you pack them out praise the Lord amen whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere now this is St John 5:19 if you don't know this is where the bride ought the sun should be St John 5:19 the sun can do nothing but what he see the father do that do the son likewise this is the point the end of it all we only do what the father says do St John 5:19 amen this is what brother Brandon is explaining here whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt anyway you walk right on if the Lord says this is nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now now you're coming in perfect Faith see this is not Mustard Seed Faith now amen because everybody wants to stand before mountain and speak to it but when he tells you close your mouth now I thought you said I must speak there certain times you'll tell you amen but can we listen now everything he saying are we so sensitive to the spirit are we so sensitive to Father's voice voice praise the Lord you go right on just the same now you're coming to perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a Mystic to them with his perfect faith and so it is now with those who have perfect faith I Mystic to others amen so when when he said nothing is impossible to those who believe he's giving us access to the ones who believe into a realm of infinite power I said this is only under the shout now hallelujah amen to invade Jesus Christ has given us access to this for what to invade Realms of impossibility amen we actually have it encoded in our genene seed to ascend Realms of impossibility we were born to invade The Impossible we were born to see things deemed impossible to watch them bend and bow to the name of Jesus Amen yes thank you Lord amen praise the Lord amen amen that Jesus speaking through our lips yes amen nature obeying our Voice [Music] Hallelujah because those words of Jesus are longing to be uted but he has no voice but whose voice hallelujah amen Jesus has words that he wants to speak in 2025 but he's not going to thunder from the heavens he's in his bride Hallelujah so as long as we're talking the things of the world he can't find the filter to speak through our lips what am I trying to say he's trying to find expression through you Amen to speak things through you thank you Lord Christ wants to express himself through the bright body come on now but sometimes the voice of God is silenced and didn't because we are speaking our own words we are living our own lives Lord Christ can't have expression through our lips oh God help us amen so the DNA that's encoded in our genes the essence the seed that's in US it it wants to give expression to Christ to speak like Christ spoke do you know that you and Christ words are exactly the same come on now Hallelujah oh praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah Jesus wants to find expression through you where your words will find no impossibility amen and finds expression where you can manifest his power manifest his authority through you amen for his Kingdom Purpose Matthew 9:23 we need to move now amen Matthew 9:23 says if thou can't believe amen all things are possible possible to him that believeth amen praise the Lord amen if thou can believe all things are possible to them that believe amen amen so this word that's been released to us I want you to take your word and elevate it I want you to take the deadness of the word and elevate it because people have made the word dead when we repeat the word it's dead when we recite the word it's dead right but when we allow the word to have expression we give it life amen let's read 1 Corinthians 2:4 Paul is saying my speech which means my words and preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in what demonstration of the spirit and of power I'm saying we've been given accesses to this amen than Lord I say we've been given accesses to this amen this battery has run out amen it's okay I'll just grab the other mic amen just switches on what do we need Hallelujah less profession more manifestation hallelujah amen hallelujah tell your neighbor I'm tired of your profession how about some manifestation don't tell me how much power you got can you prove [Music] it hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah but in demonstration of the spirit and of power amen people preach all night people lay dead then to call the Undertaker Paul wasn't like that if my preaching caused you to fall asleep and you died I have enough power and resurrection power to raise you back up again amen yes amen praise the Lord sometimes people take 4 hours they're going to preach the revelation of this but after 4 hours you know nothing you're more confused than anything even they didn't know what they preached and they tell you Pro I need another five services to explain what what happened to God in Simplicity amen how come brother Brandon took seven days to preach the revelation of the Seven Seals yes sir and you need months and months and your your your Series has gone into hundreds part 147 what we need is demonstration of spirit and of power hallelujah amen that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of of men but in the power of God I'm asking where's our faith is it standing in some man's Revelation or is our faith resting in the power of God do we know that when we speak our word is back do we have that Faith 1 Corinthians 4:20 the kingdom of God is not in word yes sir hallelujah amen the kingdom of God is not in word but in power hallelujah amen so we are called to manifest the kingdom yes 2 Corinthians 3 and 5 now that we are sufficient of not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god it's Christ that lives in US Church who also made us able Min this is what I love I'm looking for able Ministers of the spirit I'm tired of able Ministers of the letter able ministers that can take quotes that can take scriptures able ministers really but what is the Bible saying I'm looking for able Ministers of the New Covenant the New Testament is the New Covenant not of the letter but of the spirit so what are we looking for able Ministers of the spirit so such as I have give I unto thee in the name of Jesus Amen yes all we have impartation of Revelation all we have is impartation of Revelation because all they have to give is that but he says amen able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit sir how many Ministers of the leure do we have but where are the Ministers of the spirit that can tap into the mind of Christ hallelujah amen that can leave their notes and get straight from the throne room of God hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen now what are the results of a believing church we just read there in Mark 9:23 if thou can't believe all things are possible I'm taking you this morning into the Realms of impossibility thank you Lord to take away all doubts and fears and show you that the bride has been put into a realm a place in the shout that she hasn't been accessing yes she hasn't been living that real of impossibility yes praise the Lord listen to The Prophet now he's saying listen to the last message that fell from our savior's lips then believe Mark the 16th chapter 14th verse after he appeared unto the 11 and they said at meat upgraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believe not them which had seen him after he was risen he said unto them go into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature brother Brandon goes on to say not many people just call it the word the word is right but the signs follow the word that's right yes it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we don't just preach signs we preach what the prophet is preaching we are saying signs follow the word so after all the wonderful Revelations after all the wonderful teachings where are the signs that are to be following the word amen I am asking you where are the signs that ought to be following the word thank you Jesus how are we going to prove Hebrews 13:8 amen is not Hebrews 13:8 in word only who's reading this with me thank you Lord the word is right but signs follow the word amen Paul said the gospel came to us something not in word only but through the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit not to prove that what he was speaking of he said preach it to Every Creature praise the Lord preach it to the Apostle amen sometimes the Apostle is sick need of healing if a human won't listen to you maybe an apostle needs healing maybe a c needs healing maybe a bird needs healing but speak to Every Creature because creation is waiting for its Master sometimes we are only looking for human beings to display the gospel and to speak a word sometimes you see a sick bird there but you don't think that all creation has come looking for its Master amen amen thank you Lord for those of you who don't know young ones there was an apostle that was sick or the children were sick somebody correct me if I'm wrong amen sick mother carrying babies and he came to the prophet and laid there and the prophet let it lay there he couldn't figure it out until the Lord revealed to him he must pray for that Apostle he prayed for that Apostle it greeted him amen said Thank you and went away amen hallelujah he to Every Creature praise the Lord he that believeth and is baptize shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe these are the signs that follow the word in my name they cast out Devils now we say no you know what it's not wise to cast out the devil you know what we too smart the Bible says if we cast this one out seven more will come rather live with this one than eight amen so people rather deal with that one than eight thank you Lord they shall speak with new tongues yes I believe yes brother you believe but some speak with new tongues you know nothing about Hallelujah even their boss get shocked at the words coming out of their mouths right hey praise the Lord when you're dead they come to your funeral and they're doing Christian funeral day and everyone in the work is shocked this fellow was a Christian amen now you walk to them every day of the week right they know your words came from the pits of hell now the pastor is there this brother lives such a s Sanctified life he's now resting safely In the Arms of Jesus the boss is thinking wondering if he's at the right funeral hey maybe he screams from the back what is Jesus doing washing his mouth Our Lives must be examples wherever we go like you said the last time Christ don't have undercover agents in the Army amen there's no FBI agent praise the Lord you must have full uniform on fully identified with the word if they take up serpents drink any deadly things it shall not hurt them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen now here's I just want to follow up that with another am man quote to prove that point he said in Matthew 24 true Spirits would be so close that only the very elect would tell them apart so you have a Divine amen ability to tell two Spirits apart yes sir they alone would not be deceived how can you tell two Spirits apart just give them the word test sir if they don't speak the word they are of the evil one as the evil one deceived the first two Brides he will deceive the Bride of this last days by trying to get to her to iodize herself through Creeds but just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her but God never play Signs ahead of the word signs follow the word amen as when Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord and when she did as the word said the proper sign came amen come to the word first if you got a need now listen to this come to the word first and then watch the miracle amen amen people want to you know sometimes you invite no no just come come get you you'll get you healing no come to the word first and then watch the miracle praise the Lord the seed word is energized by the spirit hallelujah amen thank you Lord so I'd like to say that when when Elijah asked that woman to bake a cake and he must have told the testimony I was being fed there by Ravens but the brook dried up but the Lord told me to come here and she must have said that's nothing but the truth amen Glory yes Hallelujah she must have told Elijah that's nothing but the truth amen so your response can change your situation right now now listen response to a testimony your response that's why I'm challenging the church now change the way we sit in church you need to become a part of everything that's happening right agreeing with a testimony can position you into a realm of Faith where all things are possible so I'm saying when somebody is testifying don't sit dumb in the service you know sometimes this happens and I'm going to say it happens here in this church when somebody's testifying here that person feels like they're in this room alone you don't hear anyone make even a murmur they don't agree they don't praise the Lord they don't get into the testimony you left alone here they feel like Alcoholics Anonymous my name left alone you can't watch it with praise I'm trying to show you a testimony now brother Brandon was giving actually write a testimony right and she didn't sit there dumb she got into the spirit of what you are saying amen I'm trying to help you church amen if you're taking offense to it then you are in the flesh I'm trying to show you how to receive your breakthrough because your agreement to a testimony can change things when a song is being sung you look there can't get into the spirit of things amen don't sit down when someone is testifying atti writes response not brother Brandon that's nothing but the truth amen what's our response to testimony we so rigid so robotic amen like a dead I can't say eagle so if you're not a dead eagle what are you dead chicken be alive respond to a testimony there's nothing wrong with you getting rowdy in the church while they're saying that's nothing but the truth brother that's nothing but the truth or say something that's my God he does paradoxes he does impossible things am nobody will get upset here praise the Lord thank you Lord amen you are speaking the truth what you was telling brother brandom you are speaking the truth truth she was giving life to brother bram's testimony because you know when brother rames comes here to testify only he knows what happens but when you agree with him and say that's nothing but the truth brother brother rames you are giving life to his testimony amen praise the Lord amen she's touched heaven heaven came down the Shan of Glory came down in the room that day amen somebody singing an anointed song get into the spirit of the song Worship the Lord through that song God can do something when you get into the spirit of it amen and I like to say again I don't like a dead church I like a church where the Holy Ghost brings emotion brother Bram says anything without emotion is death now remember there's difference between emotion and sensation brother Bram says amen that the Holy Ghost don't work with sensation but it does bring emotion amen can you imagine them there on the upper room 120 of them so casually you wouldn't have found 20 of them sitting quietly and got a quiet Holy Ghost while the other 100 are jumping about all emotional 20 stood there my Holy Ghost quiet no they all brother brandom says the door was too small so they were looking for Windows to jump through amen he said they were flying out of Windows flying out of doors drunk in the spirit amen hallelujah could not contain themselves sometimes we become over dignified sometimes Baptist wayed in Methodist wayed in nazarine wayed in amen can't say a holy ghost filled hallelujah amen amen how about we say a holy ghost hallelujah how about a holy ghost amen let's read this quote amen pay attention to what's happening here now at he writes she I guess she's sitting here this morning now you can tell a lie if the person is not there but the person is sitting right there yes sir he says actually right she's sitting here right morning sitting right there she was the first one to hear this testimony she was the first one when she when we seen the squirrels she know the commission about that and when them seven straight times that God created something amen amen I said now watch what did a agree to this is what she agreed to brother Bram is giving this testimony about the squiddles then he makes the statement and he said I said that's the same God that could create a ram for Abraham to convince him of his commission is the same God that can create a squirrel because that's what I have need of some of you don't need to speak to a mountain because that's not what you have need of but your need is different he's going to answer according to what you have need of Amen follow what the prophet is saying now he says little olti right there sitting in the back of the building with a heart off the things of the world watch the keys now get you out of the things of the world Amen she's in the spirit now what brother Bram is saying she was believing if thou can't believe am so which means her believing pulled into the realm of impossibilities brother Brandon there's nothing but the truth she didn't just say to me from here now watch all of us think brother Brandon uh that sister actually right after this what did I tell you in the beginning kept emphasizing God wants to find expression through your lips amen what does brother Bram say next God spoke out of her heart Christ in Bri form Hallelujah she didn't say it from here God spoke oh somebody reading this it's in as I was with Moses some of you want to go and write it down and see maybe you could just wrote this I never read this thing before I thought only actually WR spoke he saying God spoke out of her heart what did God use he used the limps okay yes it 60911 m for morning as I was with Moses so I will be with thee paragraph 144 to paragraph 145 you're writing it she didn't just say it from here God spoke out of her heart praise the Lord am amen you say brother Brandon does that now what watch what brother Brandon I'm trying to show you now how you need to connect with things she connected with a testimony and the testimony gave her the desire of her heart everybody understand that watch why brother Bram talks about raising your hand in church now brother brandham is telling them to raise their hand and he says brother Brandon does that mean anything it certainly does it means the difference between an eternal separation from God or an eternal presence of God when you raise your hand that means that's something in you you have power within you to break every law of signs break move gravitation and something within you makes a choice and you stick up your hand what does that do that shows an acceptance of divine Love Of Christ something in you caus you to raise your hand so something in at right caus you to speak something in you causes you to raise your hand i'm trying to show you there's a power in you yeah I'm just going to give you one more example in the mighty conqueror brother brandom is designing This Woman's Heart she's standing on the stage and because she's in this realm of perfect Faith this realm of impossibility watch how many things happen to her your female trouble has left you amen I say even this morning if somebody's sitting here with a female trouble I say your female trouble has left you amen and besides that that girl that you're praying for now remember this is not allowed prayer the prayer of our heart he says the prayer the girl that you're praying for your daughter with a heart trouble if you believe she'll get well too amen I say under the same anointing if somebody's got our trouble here you'll get well too thank you Lord thank you Lord one woman female trouble lift daughters are trouble lift but not finished you got an adopted son that's a way boy and you're praying for him to be saved isn't that right then you shall have that also amen God bless you I say if you've got a away with
