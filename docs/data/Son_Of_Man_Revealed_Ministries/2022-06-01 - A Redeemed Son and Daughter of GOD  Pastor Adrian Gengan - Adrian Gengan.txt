redeemed son and daughter of god amen continuing with our topic on adoption a redeemed son and daughter of god will turn to 1 john chapter 3 verse 1. the apostle john here is dealing with children of god 1 john chapter 3 and verse 1 behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god amen that's father's love towards us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not appear what we shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that had this hope in him purified himself even as he is pure amen if we've got this hope in us amen is purifying us amen it's making us alive hallelujah amen let's bow for prayer father we thank you lord for the reading of your word we can draw such strength from your word oh god and i pray lord this evening even as we come into your most holy presence that father you would have the preeminence of god you would have the oversight and you would have the leading oh god and father i pray the mighty angel of god the great holy spirit will sweep through this place oh god and father i pray lord that you will deliver us oh god from every situation father may you raise us up to that position of heavenly places in christ jesus when we cast down the carnal man and raise up the spiritual man now oh god father that we can have here to hear what you would say to us we commit the sick be afflicted before your lord once your healing virtues flow through their bodies oh god make them every withhold father and i pray lord jesus that you would give them a complete deliverance oh god we pray you'll bless the hero of the word now in jesus name we ask his blessings amen amen you may be seated amen so we know that sons and daughters of god amen that are called in this end time the only thing we live by in this time is to live in that realm of revelation without revelation we perish without revelation without the opening of the word we would just be another church another denomination but we live in this realm of revelation amen amen hallelujah heavenly places is the believer's position in christ amen we live in this elevated position and this elevated position has been given to us to make it through this life god knew that we couldn't make it through this life in our five senses so he gave us that sixth sense this man was living just with five senses alone and there's no hope in that amen is pursuing things to make the body happy but there is no happiness in just pursuing the five senses but faith that sixth sense amen raises up raises us up into that dimension of faith into that elevated position to help us to make it through this journey in life why we are living in satan's heathen amen a time when there's chaos upon the earth it's satan's hidden and they have gone completely insane the god of this world is being worshipped amen they do not know but they are worshiping this god of this evil age because he has come through deception he has come through religion he has swept even through the church and he is being worshipped as god amen hallelujah and if we are not in this elevated position of a man of revelation in this elevated position of our position and our authority we are going to be struggling in this world to live every day is going to be a struggle to live with all the pressures of life amen and we are going to buckle under that pressure amen if we didn't live in this world we would be stressed you say i'm stressed no you're not a believer is the most stress-free person because he has a hope he has faith in a god amen and not just in a god but in the living god amen amen a god who's proved himself alive so we are not stressed with what's happening we are not worried about what's happening but we know amen how we are going to make it amen we know how we're going to make it from one day to the next and that's through the believer's eye because we know who's going to meet us in tomorrow amen while there's uncertainty all around us we know that the lord is there because imam eternity moves through time amen eternity is not governed by time eternity has no beginning it has no end and god lives in eternity amen hallelujah so we cast all our cares on jesus if we are troubled about anything we committed to the lord and we take it to the lord in prayer amen amen hallelujah we leave our human thinking fears at the altar we leave broken hearts at the altar we leave fear at the altar the thing that's crippling our faith is fear fear of the unknown fear of uncertainty amen but what we got to do is rise up in faith and leave our insecurities at the altar and say lord i'm trusting you to see me through amen i don't want to go through life with my own ability not if you want to go through life with your own human ability amen but i'm trusting in the lord to lead me and guide me every step of the way amen being redeemed is not just a slogan but our lives testify that we are redeemed the amen son and daughter of god has a specific lifestyle amen amen hallelujah we are not conformed to the lifestyle of this world but we are transformed by the renewing of our mind to live according to a heavenly lifestyle and that lifestyle is the lifestyle of christ till christ performed in me amen hallelujah this lifestyle also displays the authority that daddy gave to me a man dominion authority the lifestyle displays the authority that a redeemed person possesses hallelujah what when we were failing the flesh god had come to give us a superpower and that superpower is the holy ghost hallelujah that changes this man amen hallelujah oh bless the name of jesus a redeemed man the daughter of god possesses qualities about them sonship authority dominion authority that circumstances around you has to obey you hallelujah and if there are people or things in this life that is pulling us away from operating in this level of authority we must reject it yes we should not accept it we must resist it we must reject it if it's trying to push down from our position amen hallelujah and you don't hold the devil an explanation for nothing yes amen we don't owe the devil an explanation for anything it's not his business why our women don't cut their hair it's not his business why our women don't wear pants and the men don't wear shorts amen they accuse the men of being dominating men and the women are stuck in bondage but what is really happening is that they are being bound when they look at you they are being condemned amen by the lies that they are living and to ease their conscience they are accusing you of being a dominating husband but it's not satan's business to know why we don't drink why we don't smoke why we don't gamble it's not his business why we don't watch television and entertain ourselves like the people of the world amen you say what satan is talking to me he's talking to you through people why must you be this way amen it's not his business amen if we are holy and undefiled and sometimes these devils come and say why don't you chill why not get so holy why don't you chill and just enjoy life amen but we don't like to chill we like to be on fire for god amen i'd rather be on fire for god than to end up in the flames of hell amen and the lake of fire but one day when he and his demon powers are bound in hell you can ask him why don't you chill there'll be no chill in hell we are not answerable to the devil if you feel you you need to answer him here's the answer we must give him get thee behind me satan amen amen the devil came to jesus at one time and said if you bow down and worship me i will give you all these things but jesus said unto him get thee behind me satan and then he says it is written it is written amen satan don't want you to recognize your position in the word he doesn't want you to know what the scripture says about you and all that has been prophesied about you amen satan certainly knows the bible and he knows his prophecy that he's gonna where he's gonna end up and he knows where you are in the bible but he's trying to keep you away from your position amen [Music] in romans chapter eight it says submit yourselves unto god resist the devil and he will flee from you amen amen hallelujah you know there's nothing that satan can offer us that will satisfy us money no women no popularity no we don't cater to the flesh because we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and that's why there is no condemnation to you who are in christ jesus hallelujah amen 1 john 5 19 says we know that we are of god and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one look at what john is saying the condition of the world is controlled by the devil but we are of god we are redeemed sons and daughters of god amen we were once the devil's property sitting in the pawn shop but we have been born with a price in fact satan has much preference to redeem you amen there was an era kinsman because of the flesh [Music] hallelujah but he knew that he did not have anything within himself to redeem you his blood couldn't redeem you amen hallelujah then you're a kinsmen four foot in fulfill feeding his claim and he took off his sandal and he had to beat it to say i'm forfeiting my claim hallelujah but then boaz came forth and he said i will pay the price for their redemption amen we were sitting in the pawn shop but now we've been bought for the price amen jesus paid it off amen he took me out of the devil's pawn shop amen hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah do you know your breakthrough is on a different decibel than where you are right now amen there must be shouts of joy and victory resound in the tense of the righteous of the lord amen one john three and eight says for this purpose the son of god was manifested to destroy the works of the devil the son of god was manifested to destroy the works of the devil not going to destroy he was manifested and the devil's work is already destroyed but he's trying to deceive you that he still has a word but he's a defeated enemy thank you amen when we were redeemed by the blood of the lamb we were born again and we are now answerable to god amen amen it's amazing how people find it to more responsibility to be answerable to a human being than to god the things we place before us if you belong to a club you would tell them hey i'm not coming in today if you belong go go belong to a work environment you would inform them hey i'm not coming today and you know what the truth of the matter is if you had a calendar and you were to mark down the days you went to work and there's 365 days in a year you might have went to work 360 days but if you mark down how many times you came to church maybe you came 300 days maybe 200 maybe 100 maybe 50 maybe two christmas and easter but people find it that they they find that they need to be more answerable to man they find this this need to to conform to a certain environment but when it comes to the think of god things of god they feel they are not arguable one day we will answer amen soon god is coming for the second part of redemption god is not finished with redemption amen the first part is to pay the price for our redemption the second part is coming to claim to redeem amen he's coming to claim his purchase position and when he's coming to claim that which he has redeemed only he will know that you are redeemed possession how will he know how will he know that you are a redeemed son and daughter of god that's what we are speaking about the redeemed son and daughter of god he's going to look for the token he's going to look for the evidence he's going to look for the seal amen hallelujah he's gonna know you are redeemed because of the holy ghost seal that is upon you because when you were redeemed with the blood you had to be born again and filled with the holy ghost now's not the time to play church now the time to be on the move for god amen hallelujah in a relay they keep the strongest runners for the last amen hallelujah amen and now if you know we are right at the end time and you are here at the end time and god entertains you to be at the end time if you are feeling weak i want you to know this evening you are the strongest finisher that's why god and purpose you to be here hallelujah amen god had confidence in you to say my son my daughter will run in the midst of that legacy and spirit amen will not be influenced by these demon powers hallelujah thank you many many man hallelujah we can't treat one service different from the next service amen but in every service we gotta give our own amen amen hallelujah praise be to the lord almighty amen the holy spirit is a seal it's the token amen is the inheritance that god has given us to operate as a redeemed son and daughter of god and when he comes back he must see that token on display amen and what kind of display is he looking for what kind of display is the lord looking for a man he's looking for one in his image and likeness amen hallelujah one that's filled with power and authority one that's a chip of the old block hey many many man hallelujah you tap knack for deity hallelujah oh hallelujah you gotta believe that now tabernacle deity and when you speak it's as good as deity speaking amen devils are cast out when you speak amen hallelujah if we take up serpents the bible says if we drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt us [Music] amen and you know what believing children lay hands upon the sick and they recover a redeemed son of god filled with the holy ghost that's the caliber of believer who is walking in the spirit and walking in truth amen we do not walk after the flesh but we are walking in spirit we are walking in truth enoch had a walk like this he knocked at a walk that he pleased god and when god told noah to build an act god did not envision enoch entering that ark right come on now amen god did never plan for enoch to enter that ark but the ark was not designed for enoch he did not suit his requirements he not did not like heavy rain he not didn't like to travel by sea he did not like to be shut up in a heart for over 300 days in fact it made him she sick hallelujah enoch was interested in others travel he was interested in dimensional travel amen and he took a walk one day until he was found no more they were looking for noah i mean enoch come on enoch it's raining enoch is not found they sent a search party they couldn't find him but enoch had other transportation that these natural eyes could not behold amen the same way amen the tribulation is not designed for you come on amen i'm not designed for the tribulation the tribulation doesn't suit my requirements i don't like to be persecuted i don't like to be forced to worship the roman catholic church and to deal with the true peace of revelation 13 and the kings of the earth i don't want to cry to rocks and mountains to fall on me in fact i don't like earthquakes i don't like calamities those things don't interest me amen i'm interested in walking in the spirit i'm interested in walking in truth amen and soon that war your walk is going to turn heavenly one of these days we'll walk from mortal to immortal life we're going to change dwelling places but before we change dwelling places we are going to change bodies because these bodies cannot dwell in that new dwelling place so we must change bodies how do we become better christians you may ask i want to be a better christian what you are talking about a redeemed son and daughter of god how do i become like that amen sons and daughters of god the things that we place before us the bible says that we are being changed into that image second corinthians 4 and 4 says this the god of this age has blinded the mind of unbelievers watch now are ye worse the god of this age has blinded the eyes of the unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god in one corinthians 13 12 he says now we see through a timely reflection as in a mirror he says we're looking at this mirror but it's like a german reflection maybe the glass is dirty portraits we see through a glass exactly but it says then we shall see face to face now i know in part then i shall know fully even as fully not he predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son so that he would be the first born among many brothers jesus wants brothers amen jesus desires siblings same caliber same authority same power jesus amen wants to be the firstborn in the family are you the son are you a sibling are you the torture of god amen if you're filled with a spirit then yes you are amen now second corinthians 3 and verse 17 watch now this is the key how do i become a better person how do i become a better christian how do i become a better son and daughter of god he says now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty amen i can tell you the spirit of the lord is here now because there's liberty in the house amen it's not a stifled praise but it's praise the lord hallelujah then he goes on to say but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord the glory of the lord coming down down down coming down amen glory of the lord coming down in fact it came down and it's here amen the glory of the lord is here the glory cloud is in this place same ahead his presence is in this place the shekinah glory of the lord is in this place now watch we are beholding in the glass the glory of the lord and our change into the same image what you are beholding is what you are being changed into from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord amen what is he saying you want to be coming to his image you want to come into his likeness you want to be a redeemed son and daughter of god you want to walk in your sonship authority this is the training ground the training ground is his word the five senses the fire the five senses of this man cannot cope with this word it's in conflict with the spirit man you gotta fight and overcome every day amen the spirit man needs to be strengthened strengthen how you say through prayer to reading the word through praising the lord through worshiping the lord amen in fact every morning you should sound the trumpet amen blow the trumpet sound on my holy mountain say the lord don't wake up in the morning and the first words you utter is a ground and a complaint but when you wake up when your eyes open praise the lord amen glory be to your name let your voice resound in heaven [Music] amen let everything that has breath praise the lord amen hallelujah you know that to to muster anything in this life we must spend hours and hours days months years practicing and mastering the out of it until we become so skilled and so good you become one with the thing that you are studying that you are mastering a soccer player becomes one with the ball a man playing cricket that becomes an extension of himself he's not second guessing or i'll just swing this thing he's got technique he's got skill amen you become one within a master marksman the one that shoots he becomes one with a gun you become one with anything that you put before you that's what the apostle paul is trying to convey what are we beholding day to day if we are not beholding his glory then you are beholding another image and you are being changed into what you behold amen how many of you know that god is a bodybuilder you know a bodybuilder he practices for hours and hours and hours not practice he trains amen but god is a great bodybuilder and he's been building up his body some didn't catch him you wake up at 12 o'clock in the night and you'll catch it [Music] amen he's been building the body up building the body and you know what he's not like one of these bodybuilders who's big on top and i speak like chicken in fact god's base is big faith feta's [Music] amen hallelujah so you must become one with what you are studying or practicing if you want to be considered the master of it the leader of it [Music] amen now what happens when somebody is training to be good at something the first time they fail you think they quit sportsmen are good examples of this they have such a strong mindset they don't quit amen they don't quit but through blood sweat and tears they mastered that sport that art that music they become the best academic if somebody's good iman is studying imam maybe their great academic become doctors professors they got phds and doctors they become an expert in their field they do this how through hard work and perseverance but we don't want to spend time in the things of god the things of god are not interesting to us we feel one service a week is good enough two servers a week is good enough the rest of the week we go on a wall god can't find us amen so how are we going to be changed into that image the son of places an image before him and he tries to impersonate that image he's idol his celebrity he anoints himself with that spirit until he becomes so consumed by it that he lives out what he is beholding but we are beholding the glory of the lord and we are being changed into the same image that we are beholding when we fail in the flesh we don't quit amen sons and daughters of god are not quitters yes amen we continue to behold his glory amen when we get discouraged we don't give up amen we don't throw in the towel amen hallelujah we pray and when we don't get an answer we are not disappointed but we continue to behold his glory we read the word and if there's something we don't understand we don't stop studying but we rely on the holy spirit to teach us and to give us an understanding of the world amen we become skilled with the word amen hallelujah in fact by now we are so skilled with the sword of the spirit amen we know how to operate the king's sword amen we know how to use the word we become masters of the word we become masters of any circumstance amen hallelujah oh somebody give god praise amen don't let the devil find you up right now amen he's trying to distract you amen but pay attention amen we become masters of the world we become skilled sportsman amen the word of god that is within us is being manifested through our lives and we will conquer satan any time any place anywhere under any condition amen we are an invincible army amen that cannot be defeated we are that super race we are that super church that's not no longer prophecy but we are their people amen trained with the sword of the spirit to slay the giant amen we specialize in cutting off heads amen hallelujah and our foot is on the serpent's head according to genesis 3 prophecy that's where our feet is the angel's foot is on the land and see we got our foot on the devil's head amen hallelujah we specialize in the same at cutting off the giants here foot on the serpent's head 200 million supernatural demons coming up against us because but we got our foot on every one of them hey man this bride is not a defeated bride amen bring 400 million this bride is able to amen why the people of the earth are possessed with demon powers and they're operating from that first fifth dimension amen and when these fourth dimension demons look how silly they are now these fifth dimension demons when they possess a person amen their power causes them to drink causes them to take drugs have suicidal thoughts strip themselves prostitute themselves indulge in rock and roll parties raise parties partake of all immoral acts they worship false gods they worship the devil and they dress it up with glitz and glamour called hollywood now we've got people called influencers that many people subscribe to and they have this area of influence people want to be like them amen but look at what satan is doing when he anoints them from that first dimension and that is why the book the legacy and spirit says they are naked wretched miserable and blind and they don't know it you think that's an equipping power these men no matter what they attain in life you will find the most successful men on the earth you go find them in a quiet space they are unfulfilled amen the most successful men on the earth you find them commit suicide you find them indulging in the violence of things why they are trying to satisfy a thirst that is within them hallelujah but we are not connected to the fourth dimension in fact we are not even connected to that sixth dimension we are connected to that seventh dimension amen and as a son and daughter of god when we get communication through that seventh dimension we are exercising sunshine authority we have power to bind if we demon in hell and cast them out we have authority over the elements of this three-dimensional world we can speak to winds and the winds of bears brother ramis we can speak to rains and the rains of bears we can speak to storm and the storm appears we can speak to sick bodies and they have to come back to our bodies again a redeemed son and daughter of god possesses this authority this power through the access of the holy spirit amen in closing i want to tell you about this boy he was living in a farm and they were very poor and he they didn't have much and his father had a little mirror that every morning he should shave himself and the boy he would jump up or climb onto this log just to try and get a glimpse of himself but all he could see was little portion he could never see his full image he would look and he would see maybe the side of his face whichever side he looked but he could never see his full image amen but he had an aunt who lived in the city was very rich and they used to go there for christmas once a year and when he came of age and of understanding now he went there with his mom and dad they went for dinner and he is out playing in the yard and having fun and he is looking at the majesty and the beauty of this place amen now i'm typing that with ladies here and the bride of jesus christ amen they think they are rich increasing goods but they are paupers in the spirit yes but when they come here in the land of the spirit they are amazed in the realm of revelation amen that's right they stand amazed yes in our presence amen so after dinner he had the best meal seven course meal and he's asking where did you get this where did you get that where did you get this but it's a hidden mystery the aunt just smiles doesn't say much so the boy said let me go explore this house and he comes and there's a stairway going up and he sees there seven steps and he's climbing up seven steps to perfection he's climbing out seven steps to perfection when he comes on that seventh step it's a big landing there and he sees this huge mirror in front of him and he sees this boy amen and he walks he's amazed to see this boy because he's never seen this boy before the full image of himself and he goes towards the mirror and he sees when he moves this way the boy moves that way when he moves this way the boy moves that way he tries to duck [Music] and he tries to touch the boy and when he reaches out that boy is reaching out to him can't you hear me amen amen you're [Music] amen amen when he touches that he realizes that that's him yes and he springs up that's me amen amen and when we looked in the denominational world we saw portions of ourselves and they told us stay with the pentecostal blessings but we were not satisfied with that amen until we came to our kinsmen's house and we came to the top of that seventh step amen and they had a huge mirror of the world and when we saw ourselves the full image reflected back to us we saw ourselves in the mirror of the word and we say that's me that is me hallelujah a redeemed son and daughter of god back in his image amen let me tell you without the holy spirit we will not make it in this life we are going to be defeated in this life amen you'll become insane you'll become a wreck why don't we trust the holy spirit to lead us and guide us the one that was sent to lead and guide the church why don't we have him he'll empower us he's not like those demon powers who strip us naked but he clothes us amen hallelujah he says let us rejoice let us be glad the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she be arrayed in final in it pure and white clothed in the royal robes of the word in majesty oh hallelujah let's live in this realm of revelation let's live in this realm of faith let's live in this realm of victory amen let us live as redeemed send them daughters of god let's look at how we can bless people let's look at how we can love people let's look at how we can help our fellow man help our fellow brothers and sisters let us reach the lost amen i say it's time we arise i say it's time we arise for that final race hallelujah a man hallelujah a redeemed son and a daughter of god are

i come back i know that heart's going to be healed because you said you come to bind up the brokenhearted amen amen thank you lord oh hallelujah the reason why we don't see the manifestation and the move of the spirit people are too afraid to ask people are too afraid to stand in the authority in their sonship authority but we need to rise up by faith amen we need to realize who we are climb up to that mark of perfection as a redeemed son of god we are perfect in the eyes of god perfect because of the holy ghost amen perfect because of the redeemed blood of the lord jesus christ amen his
