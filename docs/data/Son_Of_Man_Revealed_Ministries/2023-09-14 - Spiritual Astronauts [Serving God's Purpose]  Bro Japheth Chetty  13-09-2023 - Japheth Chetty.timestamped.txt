[4:49] with the majority
[4:51] it's going to be with a minority who
[4:53] believes it amen you'll find when we're
[4:55] moving in a time and season like this
[4:57] it's not going to be the masses of
[5:00] people in the messy churches God never
[5:02] used the masses he used a minority that
[5:05] were desperate and crying out for him
[5:07] any Revival that started it was with a
[5:09] minority group that were so hungry for
[5:11] God
[5:12] so hungry for his presence amen that
[5:15] nothing else mattered amen and I believe
[5:18] we have brothers we have sisters in this
[5:20] assembly amen who are hungering a
[5:22] thirsting after him
[5:24] Give Me Jesus or give me nothing amen
[5:26] give me his presence or give me nothing
[5:29] amen let me ask you something when when
[5:32] Jesus told the disciples to tarry in the
[5:35] city of Jerusalem
[5:36] what did he tell them to go teary
[5:38] therefore amen yes
[5:41] until you endured what
[5:45] so leave all whatever happened now with
[5:48] the hype they saw these men stumbling
[5:50] out there but you know what all of them
[5:53] came out there with the power amen oh
[5:56] yeah
[5:57] hallelujah amen amen they were saying
[6:00] hey these guys are stumbling around like
[6:02] drunk men but Jesus told him until you
[6:05] endured with power if you only saw that
[6:07] 120 there they went to set the city
[6:10] Ablaze yes right Peter's one sermon
[6:13] converted three thousand that day what
[6:16] do you think if the book of Acts
[6:17] followed each of those 120 and see what
[6:19] they did
[6:20] the Bible says that the book cannot
[6:22] contain the Miracles that were done yes
[6:25] yes amen now if you look in the book of
[6:27] Acts it follows a few of the Apostles
[6:29] and their Journeys can you imagine what
[6:32] the church was doing yeah now we are
[6:34] here he says Christ in the true church
[6:36] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[6:38] amen amen so we can invite our brother
[6:40] to come this evening and share the word
[6:41] of the Lord amen amen you're looking
[6:44] forward to a blessing amen praise the
[6:46] Lord amen thank you Jesus
[6:59] thank you
[7:00] amen I'll teach you all in the wonderful
[7:02] and precious name amen Lord and Savior
[7:05] Jesus Christ amen amen to the Lord
[7:08] tonight amen I can sense the atmosphere
[7:10] then he's charged up tonight amen
[7:14] amen hallelujah spoke about the power
[7:17] amen and tonight we're going to speak
[7:19] about Atomic power amen the Holy Ghost
[7:22] is atomic power amen amen let's open
[7:25] amen with a scripture reading then you
[7:27] can take your seats amen Hebrews chapter
[7:29] 11 verse 1.
[7:32] now Faith is the substance of things
[7:35] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[7:37] Seen yes for by it the elders obtained a
[7:40] good reports yes amen and by it we can
[7:43] also obtain a good report amen through
[7:45] faith we understand that the worlds were
[7:47] framed by the word of God so that things
[7:50] which are seen
[7:52] we're not we're not made of things which
[7:54] do appear amen let's say that again so
[7:57] that things which are seen were not made
[7:59] of things which do okay amen amen just
[8:02] two more scriptures
[8:03] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1 for
[8:07] we know that if our Earthly House of
[8:09] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[8:11] building of God and house not made with
[8:14] hands
[8:15] Eternal in the heavens amen you believe
[8:17] that yes we're waiting for the body
[8:19] change amen we believe in this Earthly
[8:21] Tabernacle be dissolved we already have
[8:24] one waiting yes amen
[8:26] The Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 12
[8:28] verse 13.
[8:31] now all has been hurt here is the
[8:33] conclusion of the matter fear God and
[8:36] keep his Commandments for this is the
[8:38] duty of all mankind yes amen may God add
[8:41] His blessings to the reading of the word
[8:43] you may take your seats amen amen
[8:45] hallelujah it's good to be in the house
[8:47] of the Lord amen amen it's good to come
[8:49] to a place where we can draw strength
[8:51] amen amen we're Believers of like
[8:53] Precious Faith Hallelujah man we can
[8:55] charge off one another yeah we can
[8:57] sharpen off one another amen so it's
[9:00] good to be in a Charged Up atmosphere
[9:02] yes amen because when we're in a place
[9:04] where there's confusion God cannot move
[9:06] amen when everyone is in one Accord and
[9:09] in one mind like they were in the upper
[9:11] room then the Holy Ghost can come down
[9:13] on your floor amen
[9:17] and in one mind and it's not our mind
[9:19] but the mind of Christ
[9:22] amen because if it was just a man's
[9:24] intellect amen each one of us have
[9:26] different ideas different theories but
[9:28] when the mind of Christ comes down it's
[9:31] Supreme intelligence amen so I'd like to
[9:34] thank our pasta for the opportunity once
[9:36] again uh to exalt the word of God I
[9:39] tried to escape today because I knew
[9:41] that I'll build a Nicholson will be here
[9:44] and I told our pastor you know if our
[9:46] brother Nicholson is here you can have
[9:47] my slots but unfortunately I couldn't
[9:49] escape okay today but nonetheless I know
[9:53] that the Lord wants to speak tonight
[9:55] amen we know that amen us ministers we
[9:58] are just here as mute vessels amen amen
[10:00] but you can draw on the gift you can put
[10:03] on the gift amen yeah so I am just here
[10:05] and you can turn the steering wheel
[10:07] whichever way you want to go amen so you
[10:09] put on the gift tonight amen and let's
[10:11] see how the Lord can bless us
[10:14] amen so for a topic tonight I want to
[10:16] speak on spiritual astronauts amen and
[10:19] for a subject
[10:21] I want to speak on serving God's purpose
[10:23] amen amen are we spiritual astronauts
[10:26] yeah amen that we all heard and listen
[10:28] to the message the countdown amen and
[10:31] the influence of this message is drawn
[10:33] from that message amen so the prophet
[10:36] Likens us unto spiritual astronauts yes
[10:38] amen amen the prophet says if everything
[10:42] serves God's purpose it's got a
[10:45] resurrection yes amen but it can only
[10:47] rise if it serves God's purpose
[10:51] if a flower lives and is not dramatized
[10:53] it will not rise again
[10:55] if you plant corn and it is not
[10:57] dramatized it will not rise again
[11:00] anything that does not serve God's
[11:02] purpose has no Resurrection yes but you
[11:06] can't keep anything in the ground that
[11:08] serves God's purpose amen I'm just
[11:10] grateful for that amen amen well even
[11:13] for those that have gone on you cannot
[11:14] keep them in the ground if you have
[11:16] served God's purpose amen it comes forth
[11:18] again to testify of a resurrection amen
[11:21] and the prophet goes on to say we know
[11:23] that all these things are right yes amen
[11:26] hallelujah amen so
[11:28] if this is so then we must find out what
[11:31] is God's purpose amen amen because if we
[11:33] don't serve this purpose we have no
[11:36] Resurrection
[11:37] amen so that is not what is our purpose
[11:40] but what is God's purpose in this hour
[11:42] what is God's purpose for our lives
[11:45] individually yes what is God's purpose
[11:47] for the church as a whole the body of
[11:50] Christ amen and we when we find this out
[11:53] when we find out what's God's purpose we
[11:56] best make sure that we serve this
[11:58] purpose because the prophet is saying
[12:00] without serving God's purpose there is
[12:02] no Resurrection amen which means there
[12:04] is no body change yes there's no
[12:06] resurrection of the Dead in Christ amen
[12:09] now that that in itself ought to sit in
[12:12] Us in urgency tonight amen a deep
[12:14] motivation to work out our own salvation
[12:16] with fear and trembling amen there are
[12:19] to put us in motion to find out what is
[12:21] God's purpose amen and are we serving
[12:23] God's purpose it now notice you can
[12:28] identify what is God's purpose yet still
[12:31] not serve God's purpose yeah
[12:33] amen you can identify God working in a
[12:36] certain place or to a certain man or
[12:37] Ministry or in a certain age
[12:40] but you can still not serve God's
[12:43] purpose amen so it's two different
[12:45] things you can recognize the message of
[12:48] your day amen you can recognize amen all
[12:51] these things that God sent a prophet and
[12:53] that God had intended to send a message
[12:55] but you can still only sympathize with
[12:58] the message yes amen you can still be
[13:00] not serving God's purpose yeah
[13:03] amen and many of the times we find
[13:06] ourselves that we are too busy serving
[13:08] our own purpose amen and now Satan is
[13:11] cunning like that because
[13:13] Satan is very smart and intellectual and
[13:15] he has us now in the most deceptive age
[13:18] amen so he's the way he's created
[13:20] Satan's Eden is to keep us so occupied
[13:23] Amen to keep us so busy yes serving
[13:26] thinking we're serving God's purpose but
[13:28] we're actually serving our own purpose
[13:30] amen amen he keeps us so busy with work
[13:32] he keeps us so busy in an age where you
[13:34] gotta have more of everything
[13:36] amen now the Bible says that amen
[13:39] contentment is godliness amen if we are
[13:42] content but in this age people cannot be
[13:45] content amen it's always about achieving
[13:48] more and wanting more yes and Satan has
[13:50] Us in this truck amen we we go to work
[13:54] and we say we need to fend for our
[13:56] families we need to amen fend for having
[13:59] our food having our shelter but then as
[14:01] you start to get more and more money
[14:03] Satan starts to bring the pride of life
[14:05] Satan starts to influence you yeah you
[14:08] want bigger and better things amen maybe
[14:10] you got a a decent house but now you
[14:12] want a bigger house yeah maybe you have
[14:14] a decent car but now you want a bigger
[14:16] car yeah and to do that you put yourself
[14:18] in more debt and when you put yourself
[14:20] in more depth you have to work more
[14:22] longer hours amen amen so Satan has Us
[14:25] in the strap amen why so that we can
[14:28] avoid serving God's purpose because they
[14:30] didn't know that if we do not serve
[14:32] God's purpose there is no Resurrection
[14:34] for us amen amen amen hallelujah but we
[14:38] thank God Amen that God is here to
[14:40] Deliver Us from those things amen God is
[14:42] here to shed light on those things amen
[14:44] so let me cannot fall prey to the
[14:46] enemies traps amen now we see that
[14:50] perhaps many are in this condition in
[14:53] the message even they've recognized
[14:55] their day and their message but perhaps
[14:57] they are not serving God's purpose when
[15:00] I say God's purpose what is God doing
[15:01] now
[15:02] amen not what God did back then yes but
[15:05] what is God doing now amen amen are they
[15:08] part of that purpose yes amen and we're
[15:10] going to find out what that purpose is
[15:12] tonight
[15:13] amen
[15:16] you see our jobs and and this world does
[15:20] not promote God's purpose
[15:22] amen school does not promote God's
[15:24] purpose that's right amen the university
[15:26] is the intellectual world does not
[15:28] promote God's purpose that is just there
[15:31] to help us get by
[15:33] but we gotta realize
[15:35] when we are over emphasizing on those
[15:38] things yes amen amen because when we
[15:41] realize it then we can start to
[15:43] prioritize the things of God amen amen
[15:46] instead of being caught in that cycle we
[15:48] can start to prioritize what God is
[15:50] doing amen and just a note on that work
[15:54] will never stop
[15:56] amen the world will never stop improving
[15:59] amen the Bulls will never stop amen and
[16:03] the birds will never stop getting higher
[16:05] and higher amen so there's got to come a
[16:07] time when you gotta put a stop to it and
[16:09] say now I have to cry out as God amen
[16:12] amen it's either now or never amen so
[16:15] tonight I want to present to you the
[16:18] opportunity of serving God's purpose so
[16:20] we ask ourselves now that was just an
[16:22] introduction and we asked ourselves what
[16:24] is God's purpose
[16:27] amen the prophet says all the natural
[16:30] achievements that has happened in the
[16:32] Earth has been forerunners of spiritual
[16:35] achievements that God has done by his
[16:37] church
[16:38] all the Natural Things types the
[16:40] spiritual things amen so if we want to
[16:42] find out what is God's purpose now we
[16:44] got to see what man is trying to achieve
[16:46] in this hour because remember Satan is a
[16:49] copycat yes and Satan just like how God
[16:52] uses man Satan also uses man yes so if
[16:55] we look at what man is trying to achieve
[16:57] now we'll be able to see what God is
[17:00] trying to achieve in the spiritual world
[17:02] and now we find that that that's what
[17:04] the prophet did in the message count
[17:06] down the prophet took what man was
[17:08] trying to achieve and he typed it with
[17:10] the spirit amen amen you see man has
[17:13] been very busy he's not being idle he's
[17:16] always trying to achieve amen is a high
[17:19] achiever amen because Lucifer was a high
[17:22] achiever amen Lucifer wanted to achieve
[17:25] he wanted to be like the most high yes
[17:27] he wanted something more amen and man is
[17:30] just like that he's always trying to
[17:31] achieve and the prophet says the natural
[17:34] Man by knowledge looks backward for his
[17:37] achievement yes that's science see what
[17:40] God has done in a formal creation
[17:43] then go out and pick up clothes and get
[17:45] pieces of rocks and fossils and elements
[17:48] and ties them together see on that
[17:50] achievement they are taking what God has
[17:52] done and are perverting it from its
[17:55] original estate and making his living
[17:57] quarters and so forth and his economy a
[18:00] little better
[18:01] but but what has been created
[18:05] that's in the natural achievement but
[18:07] God in the spiritual achievement is
[18:09] going forward amen not going backwards
[18:11] yes he is going forward looking into the
[18:14] word and believing the promises of
[18:16] things that that has never yet come for
[18:19] the spiritual Revelations to manifest
[18:21] the spiritual things that God has
[18:24] promised he sees them come to pass just
[18:27] as the scientist in his laboratory are
[18:30] working on different things to help men
[18:32] taking creation the spiritual man is
[18:35] looking forward to something that God
[18:37] has promised amen that has never yet
[18:39] been created the natural man looks
[18:42] backward the spiritual man looks forward
[18:44] amen amen this is why you cannot rely on
[18:47] what doctors say you know and what
[18:49] doctors are prescribing because they are
[18:51] Looking Backward remember the word of
[18:53] God looks forward the word of God looks
[18:55] at the Unseen amen they can see what
[18:58] they've examined by way of a test and
[19:00] they can go back in textbooks and see
[19:02] what other experts have said about this
[19:04] condition but the word of God looks
[19:06] forward to the Unseen
[19:10] but God is an achiever looking forward
[19:13] amen hallelujah amen looking at the
[19:16] answers
[19:17] amen now that's that's the way they got
[19:21] the church amen the natural church now
[19:24] we're talking about the natural Church
[19:25] they look back to the days of funi and
[19:28] Knox and Calvin that was all right in
[19:31] their day but we are looking forward to
[19:33] something else the promise that's
[19:35] greater and higher and what God has
[19:38] promised science goes back to pick it up
[19:41] but we go forward in the word of the
[19:43] Lord to find out what God has achieved
[19:45] okay thank you amen so we can't even go
[19:48] backward imagine the days of the Prophet
[19:51] because then we will be like natural man
[19:52] but if we want to achieve we're going to
[19:55] look forward amen and look into the word
[19:57] of God Amen and is that not what we have
[20:00] been doing this yes looking into the
[20:02] promises of God looking into the Unseen
[20:04] amen what God has in store for us now if
[20:07] we take just for a few moments
[20:10] amen has the prophet spoke about amen
[20:14] the countdown and he takes us back to
[20:16] Luther's day amen and the prophet says
[20:19] that in Luther's day amen they started
[20:22] off with the horse and buggy
[20:24] amen this was the 16th century
[20:27] amen and in the 16th century
[20:31] it was regarded as the age of historians
[20:34] and the rise of the western civilization
[20:38] Amen in this age you had what is called
[20:40] the Renaissance yeah yeah for all of you
[20:42] who did history in schools amen amen in
[20:45] Italy and Europe and it saw the
[20:47] emergence of important artists authors
[20:50] and scientists and led to the foundation
[20:53] of important subjects which include
[20:55] accounting and political political
[20:57] science and it also led to Major
[21:00] Revolutions in astronomy now you see all
[21:03] the way back there in Luther's age they
[21:06] were not ready for the astronaut age but
[21:08] they started to have the roots of it
[21:10] amen the science of astronomy already
[21:12] started amen men started to ponder about
[21:14] the stars and look into the heavenlies
[21:17] amen we know that in Luther's day God
[21:19] was trying to achieve something as well
[21:21] and God brought about justification amen
[21:24] but in the beginning
[21:27] amen of this age the justification age
[21:30] amen
[21:31] it was not ready for the spiritual
[21:33] astronaut age but amen it had the
[21:36] Grassroots of it amen because the
[21:38] prophet said that the same Holy Ghost
[21:39] amen performs all three states amen OB
[21:42] justification sanctification and the
[21:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost but it was at
[21:46] its infancy amen amen and the prophet
[21:49] goes on to say Amen that in this age God
[21:52] was trying to achieve amen he was
[21:54] starting to deliver the people out of
[21:56] Catholicism and and the Creeds of man
[21:59] amen and the Dogma is a man amen and the
[22:02] church now started now to take off amen
[22:04] amen they started to move no more on
[22:06] foot but they decided to be able to
[22:07] travel amen they started to go a bit
[22:10] more forward than one man could do
[22:11] previously amen now notice that
[22:15] amen when no doubt whenever man comes up
[22:18] with a new invention there's always
[22:19] critiques amen there's always opposition
[22:22] to it
[22:23] and this is true amen even in the days
[22:25] of Luther amen no doubt there would have
[22:28] been critics to when man wanted to
[22:30] travel by a horse and buggy amen there
[22:33] would have been opposition to it to
[22:34] think that maybe this IJ is crazy yeah
[22:36] amen
[22:38] and no doubt there was critics when
[22:40] Luther came with his message of
[22:42] justification yes even he seemed like a
[22:44] mad person amen protesting against the
[22:47] Catholic Church an organization that was
[22:49] already established yes amen and
[22:51] organization that was already recognized
[22:53] amen but this was one man protesting
[22:56] against the Catholic Church yes amen you
[22:58] see there's always opposition when man
[23:00] wants to achieve something in the same
[23:02] way there is always opposition when God
[23:04] is trying to achieve something amen now
[23:06] I want you to remember that so when we
[23:08] come to the end of this message because
[23:10] this year amen we know God is trying to
[23:12] achieve something amen I mean God is
[23:14] trying to achieve something we are going
[23:15] to see that there is opposition yes amen
[23:18] but the prophet said if man ever wants
[23:21] to achieve anything he's got to be
[23:23] perseverant amen amen hallelujah amen
[23:26] when George Washington amen needed to
[23:28] win that battle amen the prophet said he
[23:30] had to be perseverant yes amen he had to
[23:32] get on his knees and fish in the cold
[23:34] snow amen it didn't matter if he took
[23:36] the all night amen yes but he
[23:38] perseverance amen and that is how he got
[23:41] the victory amen like Noah who could
[23:44] preach about 120 years amen they were
[23:46] perseverance preaching the word of God
[23:48] amen amen God has persevered men
[23:51] throughout the Bible amen amen so in
[23:53] this age we've got to be perseverant
[23:55] amen even when there's opposition Amen
[23:57] to what God wants to do hallelujah amen
[24:01] now we see then the Wesleyan age starts
[24:04] to come and we know in the natural man
[24:07] starts to get more advanced and he
[24:09] starts to go into the automobile age
[24:12] amen and the prophet tells us that the
[24:14] automobile was nothing majorly different
[24:16] from the Austin body was still
[24:18] horsepower but just more power yeah amen
[24:21] the prophet said he just took more
[24:23] horsepower amen and so the Wesleyan age
[24:26] came with sanctification and the prophet
[24:28] said it was just more power amen it was
[24:31] the same Holy Spirit just more often
[24:33] amen amen the prophet said it was the
[24:35] same Holy Spirit doing justification but
[24:38] when it was time for sanctification to
[24:40] come those that denominated around
[24:42] Luther's message did not want to go on
[24:45] to sanctification they wanted to stay
[24:47] with justification but those that
[24:49] accepted previously his message had
[24:51] justification plus sanctification amen
[24:54] they had more power amen more of the
[24:57] Holy Ghost amen but it was still amen at
[25:01] his infancy we see in the natural in
[25:03] this age we only started to get the
[25:05] first steam automobiles Amen in its
[25:09] infancy and in this age began the
[25:11] industrial Revolution
[25:13] where man started to move from doing
[25:16] work literally with his hands and
[25:18] started to make Machinery to do the work
[25:20] for him amen amen men move from the
[25:23] agricultural age to creating machines
[25:25] amen and the church moved on to
[25:27] sanctification where the church started
[25:30] to be cleaned up amen the church started
[25:32] to be live Sanctified lives yes amen
[25:35] they started to live holy lives amen and
[25:37] the prophet said it's too bad that the
[25:39] church has lost some of that yes amen
[25:41] but I hope in the message amen that we
[25:43] can hold on to Holiness amen I hope in
[25:46] the message that after all this time we
[25:48] can still keep the standard of the
[25:50] message amen or sometimes when the enemy
[25:53] wants to creep in and take away some of
[25:55] those things that will restore unto us
[25:57] but we're going to put up our defenses
[25:59] amen we're going to raise the bar amen
[26:02] we're going to raise the standard amen
[26:04] and we were to uphold Holiness amen
[26:06] hallelujah amen and what was it more
[26:09] power to the church amen what was the
[26:12] power now it was holiness yeah there was
[26:14] a power to the church
[26:17] amen
[26:20] and the prophet said amen the automobile
[26:22] just started to multiply more power amen
[26:26] and sanctification just started to
[26:28] multiply amen more power of the Holy
[26:31] Ghost amen amen it was justification
[26:33] plus sanctification
[26:37] um amen then we go on
[26:39] Amen to the Pentecost Revival Amen in
[26:42] Azusa Street
[26:44] amen and we see in this time amen we
[26:47] know that the messenger of the age comes
[26:49] at the end of the age
[26:51] and at the end of the age man starts to
[26:53] denominate yeah amen man starts to amen
[26:56] want to achieve his own things and start
[26:58] to incorporate his own ideas because
[27:01] when God is not moving man is not
[27:03] content man wants to then take on his
[27:05] own yeah uh role amen man wants to take
[27:08] control rather than rely on the Holy
[27:11] Ghost amen amen
[27:21] Holiness the nazarenes and the church
[27:24] and all of these things amen they
[27:26] started to form their own sex
[27:28] but then comes the Pentecostal Revival
[27:31] in Azusa Street
[27:33] amen and in this age which is the 20th
[27:36] century natural man is getting into the
[27:39] airplane age

[30:06] mixer

[30:17] models of scientific understanding
[30:19] unprecedented scopes of Warfare new
[30:22] modes of communication that would
[30:24] operate at nearly instant speeds and new
[30:27] forms of Art and entertainment amen so
[30:30] man just started to take off the Earth
[30:32] amen is gone on from traveling in an
[30:34] automobile on the roads and he's getting
[30:37] starting to get a taste of the
[30:38] heavenlies now amen he's starting to
[30:40] travel by plane he's starting to travel
[30:42] up in the skies amen is starting to get
[30:45] better Communications amen at faster
[30:47] speeds amen his level of warfare has
[30:51] increased demand he's starting to have
[30:52] new weapons bombs and machine guns and
[30:55] all of these things amen and now in the
[30:58] same way the church has started to take
[30:59] off at this time amen with the Pentecost
[31:01] Revival in Azusa Street a man with the
[31:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[31:06] restoration of the gifts the church has
[31:08] started to throw up into the heavenlies
[31:10] amen they started to get a taste amen
[31:12] for the heavenlies amen now moving on
[31:15] from the mayonnaise amen from the man
[31:17] age of the reformers and starting to get
[31:19] a taste of the heavenlies amen and
[31:22] notice it was just more power amen so
[31:25] now the Jazz Saturday have justification
[31:27] sanctification and the baptism of the
[31:30] Holy Ghost amen it was more power Amen
[31:32] to the church amen the same power but
[31:35] multiply amen amen and notice man's
[31:39] Community communication with God has
[31:41] become even faster amen man started to
[31:44] get the gift of even speaking in tongues
[31:46] amen where he could speak in a Heavenly
[31:48] language amen amen his language now
[31:51] could go up into the heavenlies amen
[31:53] amen the church amen starts to have
[31:56] better Warfare amen because now they
[31:58] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[32:00] they had new weapons to attack the enemy
[32:02] with amen they now started to give the
[32:05] enemy a beating amen they had better
[32:07] Warfare amen just like natural men have
[32:11] better Warfare amen you see what man is
[32:13] trying to even the natural we can then
[32:16] see what's God's purpose in the
[32:18] spiritual amen hallelujah
[32:20] amen man who has always been on the
[32:23] earth he's always been Earthbound for 6
[32:26] 000 years now he starts to get a taste
[32:28] of the clouds amen he starts to get a
[32:30] taste of the Skies
[32:32] and the church amen which seems like
[32:34] seemed like all along it was Earthbound
[32:36] coming from the Dark Ages amen but now
[32:39] it started to flap its wings amen amen
[32:41] now it started to get a taste of
[32:43] Pentecost amen hallelujah
[32:46] now remember we're talking about what is
[32:49] God's purpose amen and to understand
[32:51] amen God's purpose we are looking at
[32:53] what man is achieving in the natural
[32:55] but God is trying to achieve even more
[32:58] amen because now we see that man starts
[33:00] to go into the astronaut age
[33:03] amen man starts to end into space for
[33:06] the first time yes Amen in 1961 amen
[33:10] 12th of April 1961 man enters the space
[33:13] for the first time amen amen now this is
[33:16] not when man went to the moon this is
[33:17] when man enters into inter-orbits he was
[33:20] still into the orbits of the earth amen
[33:24] and for the first time man entered into
[33:26] space
[33:27] and why why is man trying to probe into
[33:30] space because man has always tried to
[33:32] find God yeah
[33:33] man is always trying to find where is
[33:36] this God
[33:37] he always wants to know what is out
[33:39] there yes amen because remember man's
[33:41] concept of Heaven is still above
[33:44] amen they don't see it as another
[33:46] dimension yes amen so man starts to
[33:49] Trove into space
[33:51] amen and he entered space for the first
[33:53] time and orbits the earth for about 108
[33:55] minutes
[33:57] and while a man is trying to find all
[33:59] these things and trying to find God and
[34:00] he's probing into space on the same day
[34:03] the 12th of April 1961 the prophet is
[34:07] preaching down on earth a greater than
[34:08] Solomon is here
[34:10] amen so while man is trying to find God
[34:13] and proving God comes down amen amen and
[34:17] the prophet did a greater than Solomon
[34:18] is here amen now we don't have to search
[34:21] like man for God because God works the
[34:24] opposite day God searches down for man
[34:26] amen Adam when he sinned he did not go
[34:30] out searching for God Amen Adam hid from
[34:33] God but God went searching for him amen
[34:36] so yeah man he's been out searching but
[34:39] God comes down Amen on the earth amen
[34:41] the prophet is preaching a greater than
[34:43] Solomon is here and didn't he say Amen
[34:46] on that day the queen of the South will
[34:48] rise to judge his generation amen
[34:51] because she traveled so far to see the
[34:54] wisdom of Solomon greater than Solomon
[34:56] was here right D in the USA was a
[34:59] prophet of God
[35:00] amen and he was not unknown he was known
[35:04] to everyone amen he was highly
[35:05] Vindicated
[35:07] amen right there revealing Christ but
[35:10] yet man wants to probe into space and
[35:12] try and find God
[35:14] amen
[35:16] God is so different to man amen God
[35:18] comes down searching for his church
[35:21] now notice but this was still a man in
[35:24] into orbit amen man had still not left
[35:26] the Earth's organs yet in 1961 because
[35:29] we know in 1961 the seals has not been
[35:32] opened yet yes amen the prophet was
[35:34] still waiting for a message at this time
[35:36] amen until 1963 the prophet had no
[35:40] message we know that yeah he was
[35:41] restoring all those things that we lost
[35:43] the water baptism and all of these
[35:45] things but he did not have his messages
[35:47] yet amen you see we can Rejoice around
[35:51] those things and restoration of the
[35:53] baptism of the whole uh in the name of
[35:55] the Lord Jesus Christ and all of these
[35:57] things but that is still just into
[35:59] Albert Faith amen it's not Interstellar
[36:02] faith is yet it's still into Albert
[36:05] Faith amen we still just here around the
[36:07] earth amen
[36:09] but we notice amen that God wanted to
[36:12] achieve something more amen because man
[36:15] was not content just being around the
[36:17] Earth's orbit
[36:18] man wanted to achieve something more
[36:21] amen now what is typing in this earth
[36:24] amen the Earth is our bodies amen amen
[36:28] amen
[36:29] and we can't just have into all good
[36:31] faith amen if we want to change these
[36:33] bodies amen we want to travel beyond the
[36:37] stars amen we want to travel Beyond
[36:39] Dimensions amen amen you see
[36:42] man was still stuck in this inter orbit
[36:45] of the Earth
[36:46] amen but in 1969
[36:49] man now lands on the moon now there's a
[36:52] lot of controversy as to whether this
[36:54] happened or not personally I don't
[36:55] believe it happened
[36:57] but let's take since Man Records it in
[36:59] history let's take man's word for it
[37:01] amen because the reason why I don't
[37:04] believe it is because the prophet said
[37:05] man will never land on the moon yeah
[37:09] so I believe a prophet amen more than
[37:11] science amen but if we take men's
[37:15] recorded history man supposedly landed
[37:17] on the moon in 1969.
[37:20] and the mission was called the Apollo
[37:22] 11.
[37:25] now I'm so many of you maybe at some
[37:27] stage have watched the video It's All
[37:29] Around YouTube now of how the spaceship
[37:31] is supposedly landing on the moon and if
[37:34] you watch the video you will see this
[37:36] kind of small ship landing on this huge
[37:40] surface of the Moon
[37:42] and if we look at the word Apollo 11
[37:45] let's look at the meaning of the name
[37:47] NASA took the name Apollo from the Greek
[37:50] mythology Apollo as a Greek god
[37:53] hey man see you good
[37:55] this God the Greek god landing on the
[37:58] moon
[37:59] amen Apollo 11. and that was in 1969
[38:03] but in 1963 God had already beat man to
[38:07] landing on the moon yeah amen because
[38:09] Here Comes The Mighty Angel descending
[38:11] amen not Apollo a Greek god but God
[38:14] himself the mighty Angel amen descending
[38:19] on the earth and who is the spiritual
[38:21] Moon amen amen God is descending upon
[38:24] the body amen the head is coming down
[38:27] descending upon the body amen amen and
[38:30] we know that the moon types the church
[38:31] amen so here comes this great head
[38:34] landing on the body amen amen and we
[38:38] know that Amen in the natural man the
[38:40] head is usually the smaller part in the
[38:41] body is
[38:42] just like our Apollo the small ship
[38:45] landed on the surface of the Moon but in
[38:48] 1963 God is beating man amen God has
[38:51] landed on the moon amen not Apollo but
[38:53] the King of Kings amen the Lord of lords
[38:56] amen the Mighty God Amen oh hallelujah
[39:00] it's been unveiled yes amen hallelujah
[39:02] one man is trying to achieve in the
[39:04] natural amen we can see God is achieving
[39:07] in the spirit amen God wants you to land
[39:10] on his church amen he wanted to connect
[39:13] with the body amen because we know
[39:15] Capstone had to come down amen because
[39:18] in Capstone doesn't come down amen the
[39:20] image is not perfect amen and without
[39:23] Capstone coming down there is no Rapture
[39:25] amen because love has to come down and
[39:28] to connect with the body amen the God is
[39:31] achieving this in 1963. amen aren't you
[39:34] grateful for that amen amen hallelujah
[39:37] in fact
[39:38] Neil Armstrong was not the first to walk
[39:41] on the moon because we know for 2000
[39:43] years Jesus Christ has been walking in
[39:46] the midst of seven golden candlesticks
[39:48] amen the Church of Christ the moon amen
[39:51] reflecting the sunlight in the absence
[39:53] of the sun hallelujah oh man thinks he's
[39:56] achieving a lot amen but God is bitching
[40:00] him amen amen God is always ahead amen
[40:03] amen he did this in 1963. man goes to
[40:06] the moon in 1969 six years after because
[40:09] the number of man is like six
[40:13] Hallelujah
[40:14] amen Apollo 11. the Greek God Amen and
[40:19] what does 11 mean
[40:21] Amen in the Bible 11 represents disorder
[40:24] chaos and judgment amen and in 1963 when
[40:28] the prophet said that's our Lord up
[40:31] there he said the Supreme judge of all
[40:33] the Earth amen has come to pronounce
[40:35] judgment amen that's our Lord up there
[40:38] but is this supreme judge of all the
[40:40] other amen amen Supreme intelligence
[40:43] comes down yes amen you see Apollo 11 is
[40:46] only a gimmick
[40:48] amen because we have amen Revelations 10
[40:52] which is the mighty angel coming down
[40:53] and how many verses are in Revelation
[40:55] 10. 11 verses amen so they had Apollo 11
[41:00] but we had Revelation 10 coming on and
[41:03] 11 verses 378 messenger and to his bride
[41:07] amen hallelujah Give the Lord
[41:10] hallelujah amen the mighty Angel descend
[41:14] him
[41:15] oh Hallelujah now you might just say

[53:07] real believer what is he he's a radar
[53:10] screen watch him he begins to point
[53:12] around amen and he catches that one
[53:14] there that astronaut and he says you

[55:04] me tell you something he's not changing
[55:06] to become lecturers amen he's changing
[55:09] to become practitioners amen you know
[55:12] many people study astronomy but they
[55:13] don't ever get onto a spaceship and get
[55:16] into space amen amen they stood here on
[55:18] the earth just teaching astronomy amen
[55:20] amen don't let us be like that in the
[55:22] message just teaching the message we
[55:25] become so intellectual in the message
[55:27] amen that we can teach everyone about
[55:29] the message but we don't get up into the

[55:52] let's go quickly hey man so man is
[55:55] trying to achieve all of these things
[55:57] amen so that was then in 1963 but
[56:01] science has advanced much more further
[56:04] now
[56:04] amen so now man it's time to achieve
[56:07] many different things many stood
[56:09] eventually not into space and space and
[56:11] trying to go into Mars and to inhabit
[56:14] other planets
[56:15] he's trying to man he's trying to change
[56:18] their bodies amen trying to upgrade
[56:22] their bodies with artificial stuff
[56:24] artificial limbs and all of these things
[56:27] we see the rise of artificial
[56:29] intelligence a man man is trying to
[56:32] create a meta verse
[56:34] amen if you know what a mess of us is
[56:36] amen I watched the video of Mark
[56:39] Zuckerberg and they are creating this
[56:41] virtual reality space amen it's like
[56:44] another dimension because remember man
[56:47] only can tap into the fourth dimension
[56:50] he cannot tap into the sixth dimensional
[56:52] the seven Dimension is influenced by The
[56:55] Fifth Dimension but he Taps into the
[56:57] front Dimension so he wants to create
[57:00] this virtual reality world where if you
[57:03] go into this virtual world you can
[57:05] virtually live there
[57:07] you can study in this virtual world I've
[57:09] seen the video of how they intend doing
[57:11] it you can be seated at your home and
[57:13] you put on this virtual reality device
[57:16] and all of a sudden you are in a lecture
[57:19] room even though you see the
[57:21] in the comfort of your room
[57:24] and usually you know right now the
[57:27] technology that we have we can video
[57:29] call someone and we see them on a screen
[57:31] but in this virtual world this person is
[57:33] standing next to you and you can talk to
[57:36] this person in real time next to you
[57:39] this is what man is achieving now
[57:41] amen and we know that this is only
[57:44] speaking about the Unseen World and the
[57:47] changing of Dimensions amen man is
[57:49] trying to tap into the fourth dimension
[57:51] but the church amen has tapped into the
[57:54] seven dimensions amen amen we're not
[57:57] artificial intelligent but Supreme
[57:59] intelligence has come down even we've
[58:01] heard this a few weeks amen Supreme
[58:03] intelligence has come down amen amen God
[58:06] is trying to achieve Amen in his church
[58:08] where he has a church Reliant upon
[58:11] Supreme intelligence amen you see that
[58:14] that is what God's plan is in this hour
[58:17] yeah amen you see that is why the
[58:19] prophet went beyond the curtain of time
[58:21] amen when man is trying to achieve this
[58:24] amen we have had someone who could cross
[58:26] over into another dimension amen and
[58:29] tell us about inter-dimensional travel
[58:31] amen hallelujah amen we are someone who
[58:35] could give us a positive report amen and
[58:38] come back with a good report amen you
[58:40] see so we see the rise of artificial
[58:43] intelligence
[58:44] and the invention of artificial
[58:47] intelligence came about to develop
[58:49] machines that can perform tasks without
[58:52] requiring human intelligence for
[58:55] accomplishment
[58:56] and the mind of Christ came down so that
[58:59] when Supreme intelligence is here it
[59:01] does not take human intelligence anymore
[59:03] yes but when we can get so surrendered
[59:06] and so full of God and so full of the
[59:09] mind of Christ get God can accomplish
[59:11] his goals through us not relying on
[59:14] human intelligence you see what man is
[59:16] trying to do with artificial
[59:17] intelligence God is doing with his
[59:19] church now amen the prophet God only
[59:22] needs one man just let him get one man
[59:25] in his hand the world will think he's
[59:27] crazy but he will drive home the gospel
[59:29] when he's thoroughly convinced that
[59:32] Jesus Christ Remains the same yesterday
[59:33] today and forever under anything else he
[59:36] will stand true and go on Amen Prophet
[59:39] goes on to say God only wants one man
[59:42] that he will that he can fully get into
[59:45] his complete control amen you see just
[59:48] like our artificial intelligence needs
[59:50] to get to a place where he does not need
[59:52] human intelligence anymore God is trying
[59:55] to get his shirts to a place where he
[59:57] doesn't need man's intellect anymore but
[59:59] we can rely on the Supreme intelligence
[1:00:01] of Christ Jesus amen if we can get to
[1:00:04] the stage where we are fully surrendered
[1:00:06] to him yes amen artificial intelligence
[1:00:09] is the simulation and mimicking of human
[1:00:12] intelligence by machines to understand
[1:00:14] learn plan and perform like humans and
[1:00:18] the Church of God when it has the Mind
[1:00:20] effect starts to behave the same way
[1:00:22] like Christ it starts to mimic Christ
[1:00:25] amen it starts to simulate The Life of
[1:00:27] Christ amen and so Christ has come down
[1:00:30] on the earth so that when he connects to
[1:00:33] the body we can do the Greater Works The
[1:00:36] Works that Christ did we can do also
[1:00:38] amen amen amen you see AI performs in
[1:00:41] Stars by going through certain process
[1:00:43] services and it ingests inputs amen and
[1:00:46] data points and we as the bride of
[1:00:49] Christ we have taken the book from the
[1:00:51] hand of the mighty Angel and we have
[1:00:53] ingested in amen we have digested it
[1:00:55] amen and by doing so we have analyzed
[1:00:58] the data points amen and now we have
[1:01:01] that Supreme intelligence amen within us
[1:01:03] amen God is achieving this through his
[1:01:06] church yes amen amen why so what is
[1:01:09] God's purpose amen we see God is trying
[1:01:12] to achieve a church amen that can come
[1:01:14] to a state that is so fully surrendered
[1:01:16] amen amen so full of the mind of Christ
[1:01:18] amen that can be spiritual astronauts
[1:01:21] amen amen that can defy the laws of the
[1:01:24] earth amen that can defy The Impossible
[1:01:27] God is trying to achieve a people amen
[1:01:29] that can take a body change amen God is
[1:01:32] trying to achieve a people amen that can
[1:01:34] do the Greater Works yes amen this is
[1:01:36] what God is trying to achieve yes so the
[1:01:39] question tonight is are we serving God's
[1:01:42] purpose
[1:01:43] amen with labor not what God is trying
[1:01:45] to achieve what is God's purpose but are
[1:01:48] we achieving God's purpose
[1:01:50] amen and we can I can confidently say
[1:01:53] Amen this year
[1:01:55] God Amen through his church he's
[1:01:57] achieving his purpose amen amen I came
[1:01:59] without a shadow of God saying God is
[1:02:01] starting to achieve with his church what
[1:02:03] he intended to achieve amen and that is
[1:02:06] why he descended Amen in 1963 that is
[1:02:09] why he descended amen for this very
[1:02:12] purpose Amen to achieve in his church
[1:02:14] amen that which is achieving now yes
[1:02:17] Hallelujah and it's the same power amen
[1:02:21] but just multiplied in the church it's
[1:02:23] the atomic power that's fueling the
[1:02:25] church amen amen that became now break
[1:02:27] past the sound barrier and defy gravity
[1:02:30] amen amen so nothing is impossible now
[1:02:33] amen amen because it's not a weak fate
[1:02:36] it's an atomic Faith amen it's an atomic
[1:02:39] power hallelujah amen amen I don't want
[1:02:41] to keep you much longer amen but I just
[1:02:43] want to go through a portion of
[1:02:44] scripture
[1:02:45] amen because I said to you that when man
[1:02:48] is trying to achieve something
[1:02:50] amen there's always opposition to it I
[1:02:53] mean God is trying to achieve something
[1:02:55] there's always opposition to it yeah and
[1:02:58] many times you'll see that the
[1:02:59] opposition comes from within your ranks
[1:03:01] amen amen amen so I'm gonna go I want to
[1:03:04] attempt to the page of Joshua amen I
[1:03:06] just want to go through it's it's a long
[1:03:08] chapter but I'm going to go through
[1:03:09] quite quickly
[1:03:10] just to show you aiming how you can get
[1:03:13] opposition from within your lungs
[1:03:17] now bear in mind this is Joshua chapter
[1:03:19] 22. it's very close to the end of Joshua
[1:03:22] this is the last chapter of Joshua is 24
[1:03:24] Joshua times the Holy Ghost amen so we
[1:03:28] almost join here to the end of the age
[1:03:30] of the Holy Ghost we have chapter 22
[1:03:33] we're about to go into chapter 23 we in
[1:03:36] the year 23 2023 when the angel of the
[1:03:39] Lord wants to move amen so in chapter 22
[1:03:42] amen then Joshua summoned
[1:03:45] another really something because this is
[1:03:47] the NIV version
[1:03:49] amen then Joshua called the rubinites
[1:03:51] and the gallites and the half tribe of
[1:03:54] manessa
[1:03:56] and said unto them you have kept all
[1:03:58] that Moses the servant of the Lord
[1:04:00] commanded you and have obeyed my voice
[1:04:03] in all that I commanded you amen so they
[1:04:05] had their Prophet Moses and they've kept
[1:04:07] all that Moses has said amen you have
[1:04:10] not left your brethren these many days
[1:04:12] until this day but I've kept the charge
[1:04:14] of the Commandment of the Lord your God
[1:04:18] and now the Lord your God had given rest
[1:04:20] unto your brethren as he has promised
[1:04:22] them deafana return yeah and guarantee
[1:04:25] your chance and to the land of your
[1:04:27] possession amen so it's time to get back
[1:04:29] to your land of inheritance your land or
[1:04:31] possession which Moses the servant of
[1:04:33] the lord gave you on the other side of
[1:04:35] the Jordan
[1:04:37] but take diligent here to do the
[1:04:39] Commandments in the Lord which Moses and
[1:04:42] the servant of the Lord charged you to
[1:04:44] love the Lord your God and walk in his
[1:04:46] Commandments amen let's go down
[1:04:49] so Joshua blessed them and sent them and
[1:04:52] they went today unto their tents
[1:04:55] now to the one half of the tribe of
[1:04:57] monessa Amen we can just go a bit more
[1:04:59] down
[1:05:02] here Joshua blesses them you can go a
[1:05:04] little bit more down
[1:05:06] and the children of Reuben and the
[1:05:07] children of God and half the tribe of
[1:05:09] Minister returned and departed from the
[1:05:12] children of Israel I remember Israel
[1:05:14] disciple now the message as a whole
[1:05:16] amen but here there's two and a half
[1:05:19] tribes which is a minority compared to
[1:05:21] the rest of the tribes of Israel
[1:05:23] amen is departing from the children of
[1:05:25] Israel
[1:05:26] which is in the land of Canaan to go on
[1:05:29] to the country of the land
[1:05:31] through the land of their possession so
[1:05:33] this minority is going to possess their
[1:05:35] own land
[1:05:36] amen where they were possessed according
[1:05:38] to the word of the lord The Hand by the
[1:05:40] hand of Moses
[1:05:42] and when they came under the borders of
[1:05:44] Jordan amen so they're about to come to
[1:05:47] the crossing point remember we close to
[1:05:49] the end of the age of the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:51] they're about to come to the crossover
[1:05:53] point
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:55] that are in the land of Cain and the
[1:05:57] children of Reuben the children of God
[1:05:59] and half the tribe of Vanessa birthday
[1:06:01] an altar by Jordan a great author to see
[1:06:04] too
[1:06:06] and the children of Israel heard saying
[1:06:09] and said behold the children of Reuben
[1:06:12] and the children of God and the half
[1:06:14] tribe of minessa have built an altar
[1:06:16] over against the land of Canaan in the
[1:06:19] borders of Jordan at the passage of the
[1:06:21] children of Israel
[1:06:23] and may the children of Israel heard of
[1:06:25] it the whole Congregation of the
[1:06:27] children of Israel gathered themselves
[1:06:28] and Charlotte to go up to war against
[1:06:30] them so here's this minority group now
[1:06:33] that's meant to possess their land
[1:06:35] they're about to come to close to the
[1:06:37] crossover point in Jordan and they put
[1:06:40] up an altar
[1:06:41] and here the rest of the children of
[1:06:43] Israel wants to oppose them now
[1:06:48] and the children of Israel sent unto the
[1:06:51] children of Reuben and to the children
[1:06:53] of God and to the half tribe of minessa
[1:06:55] into the land of the lid Phineas the son
[1:06:58] of Elisa the Peace So now here comes the
[1:07:01] high intellectual people of Israel amen
[1:07:04] the priests
[1:07:05] and with him 10 princes these are all
[1:07:08] the high people of Israel now of each
[1:07:10] Chief has a prince throughout all the
[1:07:12] tribes of Israel and each one was and
[1:07:15] head of the house and their fathers
[1:07:17] among the thousands of Israel so these
[1:07:19] are great people now in Israel
[1:07:21] and they came unto the children of
[1:07:22] Reuben and the children of God and the
[1:07:24] half tribe of manesa into the land of
[1:07:26] Gilead and they stayed with them saying
[1:07:29] thus said the whole Congregation of the
[1:07:32] Lord so not thus say the Lord now does
[1:07:34] say the church
[1:07:36] what just passed is this that you have
[1:07:39] committed against the god of Israel to
[1:07:41] turn away this day from following the
[1:07:43] Lord in the history of build and also
[1:07:46] that ye might Rebel this day against the
[1:07:48] Lord
[1:07:50] is the iniquity of poor too little for
[1:07:52] us from which we are not cleansed until
[1:07:55] this day although there was a plague in
[1:07:57] the congregation of the Lord
[1:07:59] but that game has turned away this day
[1:08:01] if I'm following the Lord
[1:08:03] see so they reprimand in the minority
[1:08:05] group now and they're starting to quote
[1:08:07] what has happened it was it will be seen
[1:08:10] in the battle this day against the Lord
[1:08:12] and tomorrow he will be rot with the
[1:08:15] whole Congregation of Israel so Israel
[1:08:17] is saying you put up this all tonight
[1:08:18] you've gone against the Lord and they
[1:08:20] start to quote all that has transpired
[1:08:22] they start to quote all the scriptures
[1:08:24] they start to quote all the quotes now
[1:08:26] and they're going up against this
[1:08:27] minority group not but standing in the
[1:08:30] land of your possession be unclean so
[1:08:32] they say now this land that you are
[1:08:34] going to possess if you can't clean
[1:08:35] don't pass over it come over and enjoy
[1:08:38] and paraphrase and I'll come over and
[1:08:40] enjoy our position
[1:08:42] so if you're not if you're not happy
[1:08:44] with the possession that you're going to
[1:08:45] take come and enjoy our possession
[1:08:48] in building your
[1:08:50] but don't rebel against the Lord not
[1:08:52] rebel against us in building you and
[1:08:54] altar besides the altar of the Lord our
[1:08:56] God
[1:08:58] amen now they start to quote what
[1:09:00] happened to Aiken let's go down
[1:09:03] and the children of Reuben and the
[1:09:05] children of God and the half tribe of
[1:09:06] Vanessa answered and said unto the heads
[1:09:08] of the thousands of Israel
[1:09:10] the Lord God of gods the Lord God of
[1:09:13] gods he know it and Israel shall know
[1:09:15] for if we be Rebellion
[1:09:18] in other words if we have been
[1:09:19] rebellious or if in transgression
[1:09:22] against the Lord save us not this day
[1:09:25] that we have built Us in also to turn
[1:09:27] from the from following the Lord or if
[1:09:30] to offer their unburned offering on meat
[1:09:32] offering
[1:09:33] or you have to offer peace our friends
[1:09:35] they are on let the Lord himself require
[1:09:37] it
[1:09:38] if we have not rather done it for fear
[1:09:40] of this thing saying so now they give in
[1:09:43] the reason why they built the altar now
[1:09:45] amen Israel has contracted this idea
[1:09:48] that they are rebelling against the Lord
[1:09:49] now here's the reason why they built the
[1:09:51] altar
[1:09:54] and they said stay at the end of us and
[1:09:57] they said in time to come your children
[1:09:59] might speak unto our children saying
[1:10:01] what have you to do with the Lord God of
[1:10:03] Israel
[1:10:04] for the Lord had made Jordan a border
[1:10:07] between us and you yay children of
[1:10:10] Reuben and children of God you have no
[1:10:11] parts in the Lord
[1:10:13] so shall your children make your
[1:10:15] children cease from make our children
[1:10:17] sees from fearing the Lord so they are
[1:10:19] saying that one day your children is
[1:10:21] going to rise up and say that you have
[1:10:22] no part with the Lord
[1:10:24] therefore we said let us not prepare and
[1:10:27] build us an altar not for burnt offering
[1:10:29] not for sacrifice
[1:10:32] but that it may be a witness between us
[1:10:34] and you and our Generations after us
[1:10:37] that we might do the service of the Lord
[1:10:39] before him without burnt offerings and
[1:10:42] without sacrifices and with our peace
[1:10:44] offerings that your children may not say
[1:10:46] to our children in time to come you have
[1:10:49] no part in the Lord
[1:10:50] so they are saying we have both this
[1:10:52] altar to be a testimony and a witness
[1:10:55] before you and I amen that we are
[1:10:58] serving the lord you are saying to us
[1:11:00] don't go into your Possession come and
[1:11:02] enjoy your possessions but we have our
[1:11:04] possessions that we need to inherit we
[1:11:07] want to serve the Lord and this is a
[1:11:09] witness that one day your children
[1:11:10] cannot rise up and say that you are not
[1:11:12] serving the lord but Israel was wrought
[1:11:15] with us they started that they started
[1:11:17] to build up this also now in the
[1:11:19] beginning of this year amen didn't a
[1:11:22] minority group amen start to rebuild the
[1:11:25] ulcers amen didn't restart Amen in the
[1:11:28] beginning of this year start to say you
[1:11:30] know something is wrong amen why isn't
[1:11:32] God moving amongst the ranks of the
[1:11:34] message which is Israel amen why is God
[1:11:38] not moving in the way the prophet said
[1:11:40] God was supposed to move and we started
[1:11:43] to rebuild the altars of the Lord and we
[1:11:45] started to confess our wrongs we started
[1:11:48] to rededicate our lives amen we started
[1:11:50] amen this remember is just before the
[1:11:52] crossing point before the Lord comes
[1:11:54] before Jordan just before chapter 23
[1:11:57] amen amen the beginning of the year amen
[1:12:00] we started to do this now I'm not going
[1:12:02] to go on to read the rest of the
[1:12:03] scripture you can read it when you go
[1:12:04] home but then when Israel hears this
[1:12:07] they now start to get revived and start
[1:12:10] to realize that they were wrong and
[1:12:12] Israel starts to say oh please be to God
[1:12:15] because of you we are not saved because
[1:12:18] of what you have done amen we are saved
[1:12:21] now from the wrath of God Amen and that
[1:12:23] is why we not think likely of what God
[1:12:26] is doing amongst the minority groups
[1:12:28] amen don't start to think that'd be just
[1:12:30] a small group of people here
[1:12:33] amen because God uses the minority to
[1:12:36] set the rest of lays amen God will use
[1:12:39] something so small to smile to spark
[1:12:41] something the rest of the body of Christ
[1:12:43] amen and then they will start to see
[1:12:46] that okay this is why you preached What
[1:12:49] You Preach amen maybe people might have
[1:12:51] been thinking be fanatical and we keep
[1:12:53] on preaching every week about the
[1:12:55] supernatural we keep on preaching every
[1:12:57] week about doing the Greater Works but
[1:12:59] very soon they are going to start to see
[1:13:01] amen very soon that fire is gonna start
[1:13:04] to catch on to them and they are gonna
[1:13:06] start to see that they are being saved
[1:13:08] from the wrath of God Amen because the
[1:13:11] minority group has put up the answers
[1:13:13] again amen amen a minority group has
[1:13:15] started to rededicate their lives I'm
[1:13:18] not only referring to us yeah I know
[1:13:20] that God is doing a work amen throughout
[1:13:22] the world Amen amongst minority groups
[1:13:24] amen amen but then you'll watch how the
[1:13:28] intellectuals now will start to come
[1:13:29] against it amen you saw that the high
[1:13:32] princes of Israel said of the time
[1:13:34] against him amen and the high priest
[1:13:36] started to come against it but amen God
[1:13:38] is doing a work amen they started to
[1:13:41] serve God's purpose they put up the
[1:13:43] altar to serve God's purpose amen
[1:13:46] hallelujah amen amen we can stand
[1:13:48] tonight amen spiritual astronauts
[1:13:50] [Applause]
[1:13:53] amen hallelujah oh sorry I have to give
[1:13:57] you a mouthful at the End Amen but I
[1:13:59] want you to show you amen how opposition
[1:14:01] can come against amen what God is doing
[1:14:03] yes amen so don't be despondents when we
[1:14:06] get opposition
[1:14:08] amen
[1:14:10] I'm reminded of of the old movie of the
[1:14:14] Apollo 13.
[1:14:16] amen when this was the one failed
[1:14:18] mission
[1:14:19] they tried to go to the moon and this
[1:14:21] was the mission that failed
[1:14:22] and when they went to the Moon
[1:14:25] they had to instead of landing on the
[1:14:26] moon they had to figure out a way to
[1:14:29] orbit around the Moon to springboard
[1:14:31] them back into the Earth
[1:14:33] amen
[1:14:34] and
[1:14:36] the only way that they could do this was
[1:14:38] there was a group of Engineers on the
[1:14:41] earth in Houston
[1:14:42] that had to Now guide them in the
[1:14:45] spaceship what to do
[1:14:46] and they could only use the materials
[1:14:49] that they had on the spaceship
[1:14:51] so they started to run out of oxygen
[1:14:54] and all of these things and the
[1:14:56] engineers on Earth
[1:14:58] had to use what they had in the
[1:15:01] spaceship they are not trying to invent
[1:15:02] them a model that could help them
[1:15:04] preserve oxygen
[1:15:06] amen and over this however they were
[1:15:09] communicating by a voice
[1:15:11] they instructed the astronaut how to
[1:15:14] build these things using what they had
[1:15:17] amen so we as the Church of Christ amen
[1:15:20] we can only use what we have amen amen
[1:15:24] in our ranks amen which is the word of
[1:15:26] God Amen
[1:15:28] amen and the great engineer
[1:15:30] a man can put this word of God together
[1:15:34] amen
[1:15:35] we can't just do it on our own
[1:15:38] but he has to guide us from the control
[1:15:40] tower which is the Holy Ghost amen so
[1:15:44] let's pray and say God guide us yes yes

[1:22:17] that was in a meeting
[1:22:21] and normally when you're 82 you're
[1:22:23] living with maybe
[1:22:25] high blood pressure and you're living
[1:22:27] with ulcers and you're living with sugar

[1:22:34] as the preacher began to preach

[1:22:49] when you sleep you don't even wear
[1:22:50] glasses
[1:22:51] so without glasses he opened up his eyes
[1:22:54] and he had perfect vision and he's
[1:22:56] wondering what happened to him
[1:22:59] amen he got a yield of ulcers he got a
[1:23:02] yield of sugar diabetes you're going to

[1:23:21] the prophet never healed anybody

[1:23:28] the prophet couldn't heal anyone yes all
[1:23:31] he could do was raise their faith to a
[1:23:32] level
[1:23:34] to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:37] who is the one that does the healing
[1:23:39] amen if you don't mind I want to turn
[1:23:41] this camera off
