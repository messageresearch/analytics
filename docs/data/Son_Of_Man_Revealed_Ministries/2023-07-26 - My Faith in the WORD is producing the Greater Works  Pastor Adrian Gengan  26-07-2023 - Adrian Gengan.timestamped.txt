[7:55] work again day in and day out
[7:58] now that's Satan trying to distract us

[8:36] God for all things amen hallelujah he
[8:39] says remember now he's quoting a
[8:41] scripture because a lot of people like
[8:44] to quote the scripture but he's quoting
[8:45] it to bring a point amen he says a weak
[8:48] and adulterous generation seek after
[8:50] science but he says but friend
[8:52] we have been so educated we've educated
[8:55] away from the supernatural yes come on
[8:58] now yeah
[9:00] that's right I hope you're not looking
[9:02] towards denominations right now
[9:05] yeah
[9:07] we've been educated away from the
[9:09] supernatural
[9:11] that's right Jesus said this son shall
[9:14] follow them that believe
[9:16] amen did he say these signs shall follow
[9:18] the pasture only
[9:20] did he say these Sons shall follow the
[9:22] evangelists only he says these signs
[9:25] shall follow them that believe and by
[9:26] God's grace are you one of them that
[9:28] believe amen
[9:32] he says we are never seeking signs but
[9:35] God is always there with science
[9:38] from the very beginning of Genesis 2
[9:40] Revelation in the Bible and where there
[9:43] was no signs there was no God
[9:46] amen
[9:47] amen hallelujah
[9:49] amen we ought to pray like the disciples
[9:53] we ought to pray like the prophet watch
[9:55] before his service he starts he's
[9:57] praying to the Lord Lord switch forth
[9:58] and hand to heal with Miracle signs and
[10:01] wonders amen
[10:03] amen we can't be preaching without an
[10:05] expectation without the expectation for
[10:08] the demonstration of power
[10:10] yes amen and you find people they are
[10:13] too Restless after the service when God
[10:15] is fixing to move and the Holy Ghost is
[10:17] fixing to move we just want to close
[10:19] service and go home we don't want to see
[10:22] a move of God we have no desire to see
[10:24] the sick Hills amen we have no desire to
[10:27] see people filled with the baptism of
[10:28] the Holy Ghost we just want to settle
[10:31] our itching ears and our conscience to
[10:34] say we've been to church let me go home
[10:37] amen we need to be so desperate for the
[10:40] presence of God amen amen the presidency
[10:44] of God it should be the only thing we
[10:45] live for in this life
[10:48] and like we read on Sunday the hill the
[10:51] mountains melt at the presence of the
[10:54] Lord
[10:55] just like how demons respond when you
[10:58] walk up to them you walk up to a person
[11:00] demon possessed and you watch how they
[11:02] manifest yes the same way amen if you
[11:05] are carrying the presence of God
[11:06] problems must go away you don't even
[11:08] need to say a word amen the Bible says
[11:11] lay hands on the sick he doesn't say
[11:13] pray
[11:13] the Bible says lay hands on the sick and
[11:16] they shall recover
[11:18] amen
[11:19] glory be to his name
[11:21] what am I teaching you faitha's muscles
[11:24] yes
[11:26] and how do you develop muscles you train
[11:28] it
[11:30] are we training our faith are we
[11:33] exercising our faith
[11:35] exercise it in the little things yeah
[11:37] yes amen hallelujah
[11:40] glory be to his name amen praise the
[11:42] Lord praise the Lord
[11:44] amen
[11:46] so now
[11:47] you know that in the church world today
[11:49] you'll find it all over YouTube and all
[11:51] these Apostles and Prophets and
[11:52] everybody they are trying to deal with
[11:55] sickness without dealing with sin
[11:58] they're trying to use the power of God
[12:00] to heal the people but they don't deal
[12:03] with the root cause of it
[12:05] which is sin and the prophet says you
[12:07] cannot deal with sickness without
[12:09] dealing with sin that is why amen for
[12:12] sure the people the demon property lives
[12:14] in but they're a week later they got the
[12:17] demon back on them
[12:19] so they keep coming back into the prayer
[12:21] line amen hallelujah and we know that
[12:25] sin is unbelief
[12:26] amen sin is the root but we are like
[12:29] Jesus we curse the root
[12:32] amen we go to the tree we go to the
[12:35] roots of unbelief and we curse that root
[12:38] of unbelief and we say Satan take your
[12:41] unbelief out of me
[12:44] amen hallelujah
[12:46] so sickness is just an attribute of
[12:49] their unbelief
[12:50] if we get rid of the root then that's
[12:53] what Jesus do do amen amen put up 1
[12:56] Peter 2 24 there amen for sin is the
[12:59] head of the serpent unbelief is the head
[13:02] and how do you kill a serpent
[13:05] if you attack the body does it die
[13:07] what do you attack
[13:09] so sin unbelief he's the head of the
[13:11] serpent
[13:12] you've got to attack the head
[13:15] 1 Peter 2 24 hear what Jesus did Jesus
[13:18] Took the sting out of death
[13:20] Jesus Took death upon his own body he
[13:23] took sin upon his own body so that you
[13:25] and I can live in Victory amen for
[13:28] his own self bear sins in his own body
[13:33] on the tree that we being dead to our
[13:35] sins
[13:37] he took it upon himself
[13:39] so that we can be dead to sin to
[13:41] unbelief
[13:43] should live unto righteousness amen
[13:46] Satan is lying to you that you cannot
[13:48] attain righteousness I don't have my own
[13:50] righteousness it's the righteousness of
[13:52] Jesus Christ amen it's no longer I that
[13:55] liveth amen but Christ said liveth in me
[13:57] amen so I am righteous
[14:00] oh come on now get that unbelief off of
[14:02] you amen I am righteous I am cleansed I
[14:06] am perfect through the blood of Jesus
[14:09] amen don't let Satan live you and Satan
[14:11] make you live a defeated life and make
[14:13] you think oh look how unrighteous you
[14:15] are you cannot get in righteousness on
[14:18] your own not in this flesh
[14:20] you've got to look at your righteousness
[14:22] through Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[14:27] and he says not only did he take death
[14:30] away now
[14:31] by whose Stripes you were killed amen
[14:35] yes this is the scripture we ought to be
[14:38] buying this is the scripture we ought to
[14:40] know of by heart listen Isaiah 53 this
[14:43] is the word of God and shall never
[14:44] change anytime Satan comes amen and
[14:47] tries to throw sickness upon you you're
[14:49] quoting back to scripture amen tell him
[14:52] Satan
[14:53] oh Hallelujah this is scriptural now
[14:55] every time Satan came against Jesus he
[14:58] quoted back the word amen amen amen amen
[15:01] amen hallelujah
[15:05] now Jesus didn't come to redeem us just
[15:07] from sin without redeeming us from
[15:09] sickness that's what the scripture is
[15:11] saying
[15:13] yes
[15:15] amen
[15:17] and everything goes with it even death
[15:19] he redeemed us from death and we do not
[15:23] die no way in the Bible does it speak of
[15:25] us dying
[15:27] speaks of us going to sleep
[15:29] we know what that means
[15:31] sleep in this body but alive in another
[15:33] body
[15:35] amen
[15:36] a Christian does not die yes yes amen
[15:40] a Christian has eternal life amen
[15:43] Hallelujah

[15:50] we never die amen amen how can we die in
[15:53] Christ when he took our death amen glory
[15:57] be to his name amen hallelujah the
[16:00] prophet God says here that salvation
[16:02] happiness and joy is the earnest of our
[16:04] salvation
[16:07] so if you got no happiness and joy you
[16:10] are not speaking of your salvation amen
[16:13] amen people are miserable
[16:15] people find it miserable in the message
[16:18] they think hey it's so miserable amen is
[16:21] the most joyous life amen it's one of
[16:23] three amen it's one of Happiness yes
[16:26] amen
[16:27] amen that would be most miserable in any
[16:30] other church that's right but because of
[16:33] the message of the hour amen I have
[16:35] salvation I am happiness and joy yes sir
[16:38] Glory put in his name amen and here not
[16:42] only did he leave us with that with an
[16:44] Earnest for salvation but he says

[17:15] his name amen amen amen hallelujah you
[17:18] know you know in the in the natural when
[17:19] you lose one sense the other sins
[17:22] strengthens
[17:23] like if you lose sight your hearing
[17:26] strengthens right right the other sense
[17:28] becomes stronger
[17:30] right
[17:33] how about if we die the five senses
[17:36] one will happen tonight six years
[17:40] amen hallelujah
[17:44] now he says here
[17:46] and there's a reason why I put this
[17:48] and we're not focusing on denominational
[17:50] Christian now right we're focusing on
[17:51] message Christian as a denominational
[17:54] Christian with only a profession of
[17:57] faith you'll never see the mystery
[18:00] yes yes
[18:02] amen you stay in your church
[18:05] he says but be born again of the spirit
[18:07] so the valves in your innermost being in
[18:11] your mind and soul can open up to the
[18:13] full stature of what God wants you to be
[18:16] I mean if you want to say Lord open up
[18:18] my vows amen amen many many men some of
[18:22] us need some plungers here

[18:45] spirit amen he'll get rid of all
[18:47] unbelief in your life amen
[18:49] that's the reason people don't want the
[18:51] Holy Ghost they want to stay in the
[18:53] church they think the protection is in
[18:55] the message of the hour oh I got good
[18:58] news for you you're wrong
[19:00] or is it bad news
[19:03] you are wrong you are not going to make
[19:07] it to Heaven because you are in a messy
[19:08] Church
[19:10] you are going to make it because you are
[19:12] born again and filled with the spirit of
[19:13] God individually
[19:16] amen ain't nobody gonna hold my ankles
[19:21] when I go
[19:23] in that body change

[19:32] go with you
[19:36] Nicodemus spirit amen hallelujah
[19:41] glory be to his name
[19:43] now
[19:45] how would you know what you need to be
[19:47] in this hour
[19:48] if somebody doesn't take away your
[19:50] amnesia
[19:53] because we really have amnesia
[19:56] and this flesh
[20:00] it's so
[20:02] what can I say thick
[20:04] that you've got to constantly remind it
[20:06] who you are yes the spirit man within
[20:09] you who's living
[20:11] we've got to rewire ourselves
[20:14] we've got to constantly remind ourselves
[20:16] that's why we've got to constant to you
[20:18] read the word yes amen the word is
[20:20] reminding us yeah now we're going into
[20:23] some important stuff here because
[20:26] on our own we would never know what man
[20:28] was meant to be
[20:30] right there's no denomination can tell
[20:31] you how Adam operated on the earth
[20:33] there's only one man a prophet one will
[20:37] the mystery of God and unlocked the
[20:40] potential that was in Adam
[20:42] the Genesis 1 26 man yes so we'll read a
[20:45] picture and he says first you were born
[20:48] here to control all circumstances
[20:51] now we just laid the platform to show
[20:53] you that Jesus restored back everything
[20:55] in his death yes
[20:58] yes so this is our ought to be condition
[21:00] this is the goal
[21:03] become the master of all circumstances
[21:05] doesn't Romans 8 tell us that creation
[21:08] is waiting for its master
[21:11] right when God made man it made him
[21:14] Superior to anything on Earth
[21:20] Hallelujah yes amen
[21:23] go deep now are the demon powers on the
[21:26] earth yes is the photos right on the
[21:28] earth yes
[21:30] was a serpent day in the garden yes
[21:33] but who's Superior of him
[21:37] he gave him jurisdiction of everything
[21:40] on Earth
[21:42] you know we get excited when we watch
[21:44] Superman
[21:46] you are greater than Superman
[21:50] amen
[21:52] you are greater than Superman
[21:55] he gave him jurisdiction of everything
[21:57] on Earth to control everything
[22:02] he control the animal life he controlled
[22:05] for our life the fish of the sea he
[22:07] controlled the winds sounds like Jesus
[22:09] doesn't it
[22:11] because that's what the second Adam was
[22:13] he came to remind us what we were
[22:16] how can he redeem us if he himself is
[22:18] not showing us the potentials
[22:21] so when when we read denominations read
[22:24] the book they'll read the Bible
[22:27] and they they that's why I love that
[22:30] song to be like Jesus because that's me
[22:32] yes
[22:34] that's the potential of my husband amen
[22:37] the husband and wife is one amen and I'm
[22:40] a co-ed with Jesus joined Here with
[22:42] Jesus yes amen hallelujah if you if you
[22:46] think I'm off there then Peter see Jesus
[22:49] walking on water
[22:50] did he desire to walk on the water did
[22:53] he ask Jesus if he can walk on the water
[22:54] what was he asking him didn't he ask him
[22:57] can I be like you
[22:59] Peter started singing to be like Jesus
[23:01] to be like Jesus
[23:03] all I ask is to be like you right now
[23:07] can I walk on water and Jesus said sure
[23:10] come yeah amen and he walked on water
[23:15] so learn from that even that short story
[23:18] there
[23:19] don't just walk
[23:21] for a season or a little while yes
[23:24] keep your eyes fixed on Jesus don't look
[23:27] around at the circumstance because you
[23:29] know why
[23:30] you're the master of all Circumstance
[23:31] the situation is impossible yes
[23:34] yes it's not possible for men to walk on
[23:36] water Normal Man
[23:38] without faith
[23:40] so when you're looking at your sickness
[23:42] it's not possible according to science
[23:44] for somebody to recover from stage four
[23:46] cancer
[23:50] it's not possible for certain diseases
[23:52] according to science for man to recover
[23:55] but when you step out on faith amen
[23:59] don't look back at the circumstance yes
[24:01] don't look at the symptom
[24:04] amen look to the Unseen Faith looks to
[24:06] the Unseen amen I'm walking that
[24:08] Supernatural realm of faith
[24:10] so don't walk in it for a season and
[24:12] then slip and fall into the water and
[24:14] ask Jesus to save you amen hallelujah
[24:17] walk by faith not by sight amen amen
[24:21] that's the thought they walk by faith so
[24:23] here we are now and we're reading out we
[24:25] control the winds he control the plant
[24:27] life
[24:28] did Jesus control the plant life did he
[24:30] go to the tree and speak to it he
[24:32] controlled everything now this is
[24:34] talking about Adam not Jesus

[26:42] I know some of you can't wait for it to
[26:44] rain again
[26:47] amen not only that look that was Adam
[26:51] Adam was given these great powers and
[26:53] Adam could speak to the winds and it
[26:55] would stop so sisters if you're
[26:57] complaining because wind is going to
[26:59] blow my hairstyle
[27:00] you know what to do don't speak and
[27:03] complain

[27:22] until I come back I thank you Lord in
[27:24] Jesus name amen
[27:27] amen he could speak to the trees and
[27:29] they would obey him
[27:31] amen yes we were sharing getting some
[27:34] testimonies from the brothers they've
[27:35] been speaking to trees
[27:37] amen
[27:39] they spoke to trees that were not
[27:40] bearing
[27:42] fruit-bearing trees that were not
[27:43] bearing
[27:45] don't cut it down
[27:48] speak to the tree
[27:51] amen you know you know that's a reality
[27:54] you know in gardening they tell you you
[27:56] must speak to your
[27:58] plants pick your flowers
[28:00] why are they telling you they think you
[28:02] know in the natural world that's Madness
[28:04] they ask you if you're mad you're
[28:06] speaking to the tree there but they know
[28:08] there's a life in the tree
[28:11] they know that trees have life
[28:14] amen
[28:16] it sounds mad to speak to a mountain
[28:19] just like how it sounds mad for you to
[28:21] speak to an engine
[28:26] that's not that's not uh part of
[28:29] scientific world how can you speak to an
[28:32] engine
[28:33] you speak to a mountain
[28:36] eh
[28:37] but this is the potential we have amen
[28:41] amen hallelujah
[28:43] remember now what we are speaking faith
[28:44] in the world to produce the Greater
[28:46] Works
[28:47] now if you're looking for it I'm afraid
[28:49] you're too late it's already started
[28:51] amen the Greater Works have already
[28:54] started
[28:55] I can sit down here and start a
[28:57] testimony night right now amen
[28:59] hallelujah so you're too late skeptic
[29:03] you're too late I'm believer yeah amen
[29:06] amen hallelujah yes glory be to his name
[29:09] amen hallelujah amen I'm just trying to
[29:12] push your faith again amen hallelujah
[29:14] amen so that you can go on Amen
[29:16] Hallelujah walking in faith so yeah
[29:20] it's so beautiful I can't stop reading
[29:22] it yeah amen
[29:24] you could speak to the trees and they
[29:25] would obey him
[29:27] he could speak to the wildlife
[29:29] now we know what Daniel did in the
[29:31] Lion's Den
[29:33] yes
[29:36] it would obey him
[29:38] he could speak to the waters ever what
[29:41] it was everything obeyed amen Adam now
[29:44] in the beginning of man that's what God
[29:46] gave him power over everything on Earth
[29:49] and yet again Adam never had to be sick
[29:53] he never had to die
[29:55] so you go back to that enemy and you
[29:58] tell him Satan I'm not listening to your
[30:00] gospel sickness is Satan's gospel
[30:03] right he never had to die he never had
[30:06] to worry amen that's why Jesus comes and
[30:09] says don't worry
[30:11] Adam didn't have to worry he never had a
[30:14] heartache
[30:16] he never had fear and fear is the thing
[30:21] that is crippling people's feet they are
[30:23] fearful
[30:25] and you know what they're fearful about
[30:26] applying the word of God
[30:29] they are too afraid to apply the word of
[30:31] God I don't know why
[30:34] amen they'd rather sit with a situation
[30:37] than take God at his word and applied by
[30:39] faith amen but he says here everything
[30:42] was his and whatever he asked why he
[30:45] just got it everything obeyed him
[30:48] because he was God's child amen and the
[30:51] child is heir of all things amen Give
[30:53] the Lord for praise amen thank you Lord
[30:56] amen
[30:57] amen glory be to his name amen many many
[31:01] men Hallelujah
[31:04] amen let's just take a praise break here
[31:06] amen while they switch the power we are
[31:08] Heirs of the father
[31:12] we are jointed
[31:16] and we are children of his kingdom We
[31:22] are family
[31:23] we are one one more time we are ears
[31:30] tell them don't wait for you to switch
[31:31] things
[31:33] [Music]
[31:36] we are children of his kingdom and we
[31:42] are family
[31:43] we are one one more time
[31:47] [Applause]
[31:48] [Music]
[31:50] and we are join tears with the sun we
[31:56] are children
[31:57] of his kingdom we are families
[32:08] now we come to a crucial point we just
[32:11] learned about Adam and how he operated
[32:13] and that was kind of taking away the
[32:15] scale taking away the amnesia but here
[32:18] is where he failed and it's an important
[32:20] time
[32:21] because we must catch the revelation of
[32:23] this amen
[32:27] Hallelujah
[32:29] amen he says but then why is your screen
[32:32] White
[32:39] is it not projecting it's coming on
[32:40] slowly
[32:42] okay let's go to the next one it says
[32:44] but then this is important now because
[32:46] this is where we are
[32:48] then the power he was given to me to
[32:51] himself that's true
[32:53] is where he felt
[32:56] does Christ want to reproduce himself
[32:59] oh come on now church amen yes this is
[33:02] the hour where Christ wants to reproduce
[33:05] himself amen
[33:06] and this is where Satan is attacking the
[33:08] church
[33:11] it was right in the reproduction yes
[33:16] Adam was about to reproduce himself but
[33:19] Satan preaches gospel first
[33:24] and he got the bearing ground
[33:27] to reproduce his own seed true life
[33:33] and Adam had to play catch-up to save
[33:35] the woman
[33:40] but then the power that was given to
[33:42] make himself to reproduce himself is
[33:46] where he fell that is why God now comes
[33:49] to Mary
[33:50] and he reproduces himself through Mary
[33:54] it's all through reproduction yes amen
[33:57] that is why now in Peter he tells you
[34:00] that we mustn't be Barren and unfruitful
[34:03] but we need to reproduce The Life of
[34:05] Christ
[34:06] that Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[34:08] patience godliness brotherly kindness is
[34:10] the image of Christ The Life of Christ
[34:13] that we need to reproduce in our lives
[34:18] Hallelujah now there's something there
[34:21] that people don't like
[34:22] [Music]
[34:26] because people want Power
[34:29] people love what we just read
[34:31] but they don't want to love the enemies
[34:36] because power without character
[34:39] is satanic
[34:42] now Jesus didn't only teach us about
[34:44] speaking to the mountain
[34:46] Jesus also spoke to us about our
[34:48] character didn't he tell us love our
[34:50] enemies yes
[34:51] do good to them that persecute you yes
[34:53] that hate you as much as we want to
[34:55] practice the power part
[34:57] we don't want to practice the other part
[35:02] that's why it becomes demonic
[35:06] character
[35:08] power without character is
[35:12] what's that word
[35:14] but but Power Wood character is put to
[35:18] rule
[35:19] that's what he goes on to say power with
[35:23] character is fit to rule and that's what
[35:26] we want to have
[35:27] now that is one of the reasons why
[35:29] people don't want the Holy Ghost
[35:31] is because the Holy Ghost who make you
[35:33] love your enemies
[35:35] the Holy Ghost will make you pray for
[35:37] them
[35:40] amen hallelujah
[35:43] the Holy Ghost will make you have mercy
[35:45] and compassion of Jesus Christ
[35:47] oh come on now come on now do we want
[35:51] all of him on none of him do you want
[35:53] some parts do we just want to operate
[35:54] the power
[35:57] so if you really want to have the
[35:59] victory in your life yes yes to make all
[36:01] your wrongs right
[36:06] go to those people that are never
[36:08] expecting an apology from you and go and
[36:10] apologize go and make things right
[36:15] go and phone them go and talk to them
[36:18] or do you want to go to your grave do
[36:20] you want to go
[36:21] with unforgiveness with unresolved
[36:24] issues
[36:26] not in this hour
[36:28] it's too late now why would we want to
[36:31] have come so far and then just have that
[36:32] little bit root of bitterness yes
[36:37] let me just keep this little bit voucher
[36:41] uh Jesus don't curse this root
[36:45] when I see them I like to have this bit
[36:47] of feeling for them
[36:51] come on now
[36:54] Jesus is teaching us about all things
[36:56] amen he says if they slap you offer them
[36:59] decide too
[37:02] don't tell them are you lucky I'm saved
[37:06] that's not what Jesus said you must do
[37:09] hey
[37:12] Jesus said turn the other cheek
[37:14] Jesus teaching us about our character
[37:16] that comes with the power
[37:19] amen otherwise think of it did Adam kill
[37:24] the serpent
[37:26] but yet he should have been enraged this
[37:28] man just slept with his wife
[37:31] he should have been enraged
[37:34] but he had a character
[37:38] so Jesus is teaching us all things
[37:40] and he's bringing us back to all things
[37:42] right so through the fall he lost that
[37:45] power
[37:46] then it becomes
[37:48] unconscious to the fact that's why we
[37:51] just read all of that is because if
[37:53] brother Branham didn't come to tell us
[37:55] all this about Adam we wouldn't have
[37:57] known this yes
[38:02] he says we become unconscious of the
[38:04] fact
[38:05] what is unconscious
[38:08] somebody can tell me
[38:12] yeah it's like lifeless
[38:17] why am I saying that that person is like
[38:20] in asleep
[38:22] but what comes to awaken us
[38:26] hello
[38:28] what what comes to awaken us
[38:31] say the right thing
[38:32] the bride hasn't added Revival yet
[38:35] it'll take what to wake up again
[38:43] say Lord make it thunder
[38:48] some people don't like the word Thunder
[38:52] Prophet says
[38:54] Thunder is a voice so let's say seven
[38:56] voices
[38:57] you like seven voices
[38:59] sounds less scary to you
[39:01] seven voices
[39:07] he becomes unconscious of the fact after
[39:10] losing his relationship and friendship
[39:12] fellowship with the father that he lost
[39:14] this is where you'll get that he lost
[39:16] eternal life fellowship with God and
[39:18] power over the Earth right he lost that
[39:20] power he became unconscious of the fact
[39:22] he lost his relationship and friendship
[39:24] Fellowship of the father then he lost
[39:25] there and you know he lost eternal life
[39:27] right and all these great channels
[39:29] become clogged up and he couldn't get
[39:31] through
[39:33] and now when man fell he lost us and
[39:36] when he lost when he lost in the fall
[39:38] Christ come as a redeemer did you ever
[39:41] stop to think what Christ redeemed us
[39:43] for
[39:44] so he just landed everything that Adam
[39:48] fell from
[39:50] and he's saying did you ever come to
[39:52] think what Christ redeemed us for
[39:55] him or back to amen now what Adam was in
[39:59] God Christ has redeemed us back to death
[40:02] now a redeemer to redeem anything is to
[40:05] bring it back to its origin again amen
[40:08] hallelujah
[40:09] so Satan wants to keep us thinking we
[40:12] slept to change something but Christ did
[40:14] it all amen he did it on the cross so I
[40:17] can walk in Victory I can walk in power
[40:19] yes yeah amen but you've got to have the
[40:22] free to believe it amen you've got to
[40:24] take God at his word amen amen amen
[40:27] hallelujah you can walk on water you can
[40:30] speak to mountains you can speak to the
[40:32] actually you can speak to the wind in
[40:34] all the potential lays within you amen
[40:36] hallelujah but faith in the world is
[40:39] going to produce the Greater Works thank
[40:41] you Lord that is why the prophet is
[40:42] saying get back to the word get back to
[40:45] the word get back to the word it seems
[40:47] like people are so thick amen they say
[40:50] it as a theory they say it's Amen but
[40:52] they never apply the word
[40:55] so ask yourself again I'm coming back to
[40:57] some Basics how much of time are we
[40:59] spending with the word how well do we
[41:02] know the word do we know where the
[41:04] promises of God lay in the world
[41:07] amen
[41:12] amen get rid of all those other things
[41:15] that are clogging yes
[41:17] yes come on now yes we've got to get rid
[41:20] of it
[41:21] amen we should be so in love with the
[41:23] word of God that it's the only thing on
[41:25] our mind Hallelujah
[41:29] amen you know you should sing You Are
[41:32] Always On My Mind
[41:35] tell your girlfriend
[41:38] tell your husband tell your wife
[41:40] amen
[41:44] you've got very unromantic people here
[41:47] they act like they don't know what I'm
[41:48] talking about
[41:50] hey
[41:54] I was thinking about you the whole day
[41:58] hey
[42:00] a poor fellow sleeping next to his
[42:01] brother he's singing that's his
[42:02] girlfriend he's talking to her and
[42:03] things like that in his sleep
[42:06] he's thinking he's thinking about it
[42:08] constantly talking about her constantly
[42:11] what am I trying to tell you or the
[42:13] point yes the thing you love the most
[42:16] you will spend most time with it amen
[42:19] hallelujah glory be to the Lord amen

[42:49] hallelujah so we don't only have Blessed
[42:52] Assurance we got miraculate amen when
[42:55] they phone you know from the coast into
[42:56] they ask you you got medically yeah I
[42:58] got Medical Aid amen

[43:02] they say which companies say mark 16.
[43:09] glory be to his name
[43:11] amen
[43:15] so he brought it back to its origin
[43:17] again
[43:18] so every day I want you to wake up thank
[43:21] you Lord I'm back in my image yes thank
[43:23] you Lord I'm in control of all things
[43:24] Lord Romans 8 is talking about creation
[43:27] longing for its master and the groaning
[43:30] here I am today Lord Jesus I take
[43:33] control of every situation I take
[43:35] control of all circumstances every place
[43:37] the soul of my foot shall tread I'm a
[43:40] possessor of it nothing shall be able to
[43:42] stand before me all the days of my life
[43:44] yes
[43:45] say it till you believe it yes
[43:48] how does something become unconscious
[43:50] how does something reside in your
[43:52] subconscious is where the property is
[43:54] going to go next
[43:55] because at one time you don't know how
[43:57] to ride a bicycle
[43:59] but did you give it up the first time
[44:02] you fell
[44:04] or did you keep practicing yes
[44:07] yes a brother are you telling me that
[44:08] faith can be practiced
[44:11] by the prophet says faith has muscles
[44:13] and I know muscle to get more muscles I
[44:15] must practice I must exercise I'm a
[44:18] strained to grow bigger muscle yes
[44:21] why does Jesus say that if you have the
[44:25] grain of a mustard seed Faith so he's
[44:27] telling you that faith can grow that the
[44:29] disciples ask Jesus increase our faith
[44:31] so faith is something that can be grown
[44:33] amen amen you can be weak in faith but
[44:36] then you can be strong in faith let the
[44:38] weak say I am strong
[44:40] amen so Faith must be exercised
[44:43] and we're getting to that place by God's
[44:46] grace yes amen amen hallelujah
[44:49] so take control of every situation every
[44:52] morning even midday take control of the
[44:54] situation amen every time you think pray
[44:57] say Lord I Thank You Lord that I'm a
[44:59] master of all circumstances amen
[45:01] hallelujah glory be to his name
[45:04] amen
[45:05] so when he gave us eternal life he
[45:07] brought us back into Eternal Fellowship
[45:09] Amen in relationship with God and
[45:12] through this restoration is coming back
[45:14] to power but remember the power as to
[45:16] come back with character
[45:19] amen glory be to his name now he says
[45:22] here the thing is since he restored man
[45:23] back to this place man in the fall has
[45:26] lost his conscience
[45:27] so when you lose your conscience you're
[45:29] not awake of what the father put him
[45:31] here on Earth to do
[45:33] in other words all the plumbing as it
[45:35] was in our brain and the outlets the
[45:37] faith has been clogged up with business
[45:39] affair with our own life domestic things
[45:43] it's all become so clogged with death
[45:45] until God can operate through those
[45:48] channels that he made a man fall
[45:52] but all is not Allah say Lord unclog me
[45:54] even now amen all God wants is a willing
[45:57] heart and a surrendered art and a
[45:58] submission
[46:00] amen say Lord send your plumbing now
[46:03] send your primary now yes amen is on
[46:06] call 24 hours and he doesn't ever call
[46:07] out free yes amen
[46:11] glory be to his name amen now if you
[46:14] think of God designed the human body how
[46:16] he designed the amen the teeth the
[46:18] tongue the eyes the nose God made
[46:20] everything to work perfectly so that you
[46:22] can have one functioning human body
[46:24] right so it's the same way God pass in
[46:27] the body of Jesus Christ which is us
[46:30] each one of us functioning our capacity
[46:34] right he patented and he said the church
[46:36] the body of Christ in the same way God
[46:38] designed man's body that way and he
[46:40] designed the body of his son that way
[46:42] the church he designed us to come and he
[46:44] set us together in Heavenly places in
[46:46] Christ Jesus
[46:48] amen hallelujah
[46:51] amen so now we have Supernatural
[46:53] workings of God through these outlets in
[46:55] Heavenly places
[46:57] amen through gifts of the Spirit
[46:59] such as prophecy wisdom knowledge Gifts
[47:02] of healing amen
[47:03] and all these different gifts he's got
[47:05] five spiritual gifts nine spiritual
[47:07] gifts to the church and five office
[47:09] gifts yes amen hallelujah and through
[47:12] this he lets out his power
[47:15] amen
[47:16] he lets out his Revelation to the people
[47:18] now how do we get into the body quickly
[47:21] someone tell me how we get into this
[47:22] body by one
[47:24] we are
[47:26] baptized
[47:27] Hallelujah here's something we're going
[47:30] to learn now very quickly I'm going to
[47:31] go through this amen and we can just
[47:33] learn these little principles
[47:35] so Satan is working by laws everything
[47:37] on Earth has a law
[47:40] in order for anything to work on the
[47:42] earth that's why scientists are so
[47:43] successful they work according to the
[47:46] laws that they studied yes
[47:50] so Satan works by laws as well the
[47:54] problem is telling us Satan by the laws
[47:55] of sin and death
[47:58] makes everything that sin and death
[48:00] bought
[48:02] to operate to Satan's
[48:05] abort operate so Satan sends a cancer
[48:09] right
[48:11] then man recognizes it so you see you
[48:14] must be able to receive it he says say
[48:16] the man recognizes it receives it
[48:19] maybe you didn't even know you were
[48:21] receiving it
[48:23] did Eve know she was receiving it
[48:26] no
[48:27] [Music]
[48:28] well if you go and read in other places
[48:30] what does the prophet say that stress
[48:32] worry fussing will do
[48:36] yeah does he say it'll give you sickness
[48:38] they say it'll bring cancers
[48:41] so we see how we can open up ourselves
[48:42] to these channels of Satan's gospel
[48:45] without knowing it we think we're having
[48:47] a fight with that brother
[48:49] and a fuss and a quarrel and a gossip
[48:51] and a hatred but what is he doing sure
[48:55] it's Satan's gospel
[49:02] man receives it Satan sends heartaches
[49:05] we recognize it and receive it
[49:09] but how is he doing it through deception
[49:11] you're thinking I'm standing up for
[49:13] myself but
[49:14] deceiving you every time you let that
[49:17] anger get out every time you get angry
[49:19] and you let yourself amen lose patience
[49:22] what is you doing you're operating this
[49:24] gift
[49:28] no amen for that
[49:31] the prophet is teaching us how Satan
[49:33] laws work
[49:35] Satan sends outtakes we recognize it and
[49:39] receive it and if Satan by his power can
[49:42] make his laws work in man
[49:45] he's making his laws working man
[49:48] how much more of God with his power to
[49:51] make his laws work in man amen
[49:56] how much more God to his children to
[49:59] make his laws be recognized amongst
[50:01] these people of Divine Healing
[50:02] Revelation Powers gifts manifestations
[50:06] of the Spirit if the law of sin and
[50:08] death works in the people
[50:10] and the law of Liberty of Christ has
[50:12] come unto us to set us free from those
[50:15] things so we can count to Satan's gospel
[50:17] we can come to Satan's sickness yes amen
[50:21] even if sickness has come upon our body
[50:22] there is a remedy there is a cure it's
[50:26] the word of God Amen yes sir thank you
[50:28] so I believe this with all my heart I
[50:31] believe we are nearing the age that when
[50:34] people are going to recognize this thing
[50:36] thank you Lord win the rich Hallelujah
[50:41] we are in the 117th year of the church
[50:44] age this is the time this is a season
[50:47] amen amen yes
[50:49] amen
[50:51] glory be to his name
[50:53] amen amen
[50:55] so he says faith is an unconscious thing
[50:59] we need to practice it we need to build
[51:02] ourselves in the Most Holy Faith until
[51:04] it becomes second nature to us yes you
[51:07] know first when you're learning that
[51:08] guitar hey you got to watch every chord
[51:10] and you're going to place your fingers
[51:12] but as you practice
[51:14] as you become more skillful you don't
[51:16] even watch it you do it unconsciously
[51:18] you can even sing and play now
[51:21] right somebody can be talking to you can
[51:23] carry on and you can be doing things
[51:24] there
[51:25] why it becomes unconscious to you the
[51:28] prophet is saying Faith becomes
[51:30] unconscious thing
[51:32] you're so built on the word of God Amen
[51:36] thank you
[51:40] let me tell you something the only
[51:41] person not of me is that what Jesus was
[51:43] doing was himself
[51:47] yeah
[51:50] neither was he boastful
[51:53] he didn't say you guys you saw that hey
[51:55] you saw that one
[51:57] but you must watch his modern guys
[52:00] you see them operate they all over
[52:02] YouTube and everywhere they do it again
[52:04] you saw that one you saw that one
[52:09] they become boastful
[52:11] prideful when it's not them doing the
[52:13] works who's doing the works great is he
[52:17] that's in me
[52:18] so they are trying to take the glory
[52:20] they are trying to take the glory for
[52:22] themselves amen so Faith becomes an
[52:25] unconscious thing
[52:26] your real Faith your unconscious of it
[52:30] you don't know that faith is you have
[52:32] got
[52:33] it's an unconscious matter with you can
[52:35] you imagine Jesus questioning whether he
[52:37] had Faith or not to stop the winds sure
[52:39] or steal the waves who are faith enough
[52:41] to raise Lazarus up he never questioned
[52:43] his faith yes
[52:46] now the first thing before we can even
[52:48] have faith we've got to have some
[52:50] foundation for faith
[52:53] now if you know that this is the
[52:55] foundation for our faith the word of God
[52:58] heavens and Uncle pass away
[53:00] on Christ of solid rock I stand yes all
[53:03] other ground is sinking sand amen a
[53:05] house that's built on the word of God
[53:07] Amen a faith that's built on the word of
[53:09] God Amen afraid not based on the
[53:11] Theology of a seminary
[53:14] of an individual
[53:16] let me tell you something your faith is
[53:18] not built upon brother Branham
[53:20] your faith is built on the word of God
[53:22] there is no other Prophet that will lead
[53:24] you back to the Bible yes his message is
[53:27] designed to turn your heart back to the
[53:29] faith of the Bible yes
[53:34] you know that in a nutshell is the most
[53:36] simplest form of understanding what
[53:38] Malachi 4 is amen he's coming to turn
[53:41] your heart back to the faith in the
[53:42] Bible
[53:43] so don't ask me
[53:50] [Music]
[53:51] you can bear witness to them
[53:54] you young men yeah much of time you'll
[53:56] spend young women how much of time do
[53:58] you spend reading the Bible yes
[54:02] in a day
[54:04] how much of time do we spend speaking
[54:06] the word of God out of our mouth
[54:08] just any Scripture
[54:10] even for now if you don't even know the
[54:12] scriptures the scripture that you know
[54:14] just speak it out
[54:16] the Lord will bless you for it
[54:22] your faith comes when it's settled in
[54:24] the human heart it's a settled thing
[54:26] it's finished you know it's done amen
[54:33] amen you tell your wife I'll see you
[54:34] later how you know you're going to see
[54:35] it
[54:36] you have such confidence that when you
[54:39] get into your car you're going to start
[54:40] it it's going to start
[54:41] you have confidence that you're not
[54:43] gonna have a flat tire on the way
[54:45] we have confidence amen that there's no
[54:47] traffic you tell us here at a certain
[54:49] time
[54:50] you have confidence it's unconscious you
[54:53] don't even know and I don't know if you
[54:54] know sometimes you're even driving
[54:56] and you're not even paying attention to
[54:58] the role
[55:01] you that spend more time on the road
[55:03] you'll know you're thinking about you're
[55:05] you're sitting there on the beach and
[55:06] you're busy uh driving here
[55:10] like even some of you some of you in
[55:12] your bed
[55:13] you're sitting here physically
[55:21] your mind is already asleep
[55:25] That's The Power of your mind
[55:27] but the Jesus say I have faith in your
[55:29] mind
[55:30] he says confess with your mouth believe
[55:33] in your heart amen we're going to close
[55:36] now amen we'll just leave it there amen
[55:38] Hallelujah
[55:40] so one more thing here I think I just
[55:42] got one more right
[55:43] is there one more there
[55:45] he says
[55:46] you've got it so he's talking about a
[55:48] natural thing but I want you to get the
[55:49] spiritual meaning you've done things so
[55:52] much in your life that you become
[55:54] accustomed to those laws until it's a
[55:56] natural thing
[55:58] we have got to be so accustomed to Faith
[56:01] so accustomed to the word of God that it
[56:04] becomes a natural thing in our lives
[56:06] that is why we are speaking on faith in
[56:09] the world to produce the Greater Works
[56:11] amen
[56:14] you know this is the the lie that Satan
[56:16] brought upon the people
[56:18] in our Circle
[56:21] is that don't worry brother
[56:24] you receive the word for your age
[56:26] just wait for that time
[56:32] you don't read the word you don't pray
[56:34] you don't do nothing anymore
[56:38] they only want to say they're root
[56:39] resting
[56:44] without a consecrated life
[56:47] God is not going to pour his power on
[56:49] the people because what did we just say
[56:53] power without character is satanic
[56:57] so we can't continue the same old way
[56:58] and think that one day suddenly God is
[57:01] just because to close off events and to
[57:03] get his program done is I'm saying never
[57:05] mind these people are so slaughtered let
[57:06] me just pour my power on them did you
[57:08] not open up the Earth and swallow those
[57:09] people
[57:11] did he not drown
[57:13] except eight people
[57:15] do you think he's just going to do it
[57:18] just for the sake of doing it
[57:20] every time he spared people is because
[57:22] they repent to look at them they turn
[57:25] from their Wicked Ways
[57:26] yes amen people that are obedient and
[57:29] willing to surrender and and turn to God
[57:31] and say Lord we are willing to forsake
[57:33] all our Theology and everything we know
[57:35] for your presence for your power for
[57:38] your character so remember when you're
[57:40] praying for his power pray for his
[57:41] character yes
[57:43] and where can all of these things be
[57:45] found his character amen where does he
[57:47] teach us blessed are the meat here
[57:49] blessed us is he not teaching Us in his
[57:52] word yes the character of Christ
[57:55] so if you want to know his character we
[57:56] read his word if we want to know his
[57:58] power we read his word yes everything we
[58:01] need this is the manual to the
[58:04] supernatural
[58:05] the Bible
[58:07] we've got to walk in it so faith in the
[58:09] word to produce the Greater Works you
[58:12] may be looking for other things you
[58:14] thought this would be something
[58:15] imaginary that you'll be able to do the
[58:17] Greater Works I'm telling you now and
[58:19] what the prophet is saying it's faith in
[58:21] the word to produce the greater work so
[58:25] they say in the beginning there go to
[58:26] our opening scripture
[58:28] let's just read today the opening
[58:29] scripture
[58:31] amen Saint John 15 7.
[58:37] close with the scripture
[58:40] what does it say
[58:42] if you abide in me
[58:44] and my what
[58:47] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[58:50] amen and it shall be done unto you now

[1:00:03] we are praying Lord that you will
[1:00:04] protect the word inside of them Lord and
[1:00:07] I pray Lord that the people will arise
[1:00:09] Lord even if it was in correction when
[1:00:10] in some form Lord where it may have not
[1:00:13] been easy on the flesh Lord I pray Lord
