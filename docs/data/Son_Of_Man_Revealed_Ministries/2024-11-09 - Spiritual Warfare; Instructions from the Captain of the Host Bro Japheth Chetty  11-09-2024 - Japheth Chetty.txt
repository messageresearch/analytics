TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen everybody feeling good in the house of the Lord amen amen welcome you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen our sooncoming King he's worthy of the highest praise amen how many of you are looking forward to the service tonight amen our midweek service to come and worship the Lord in our prayer meeting amen where we come to pray and dedicate Our Lives to the Lord and also the prayer request amen of the Saints not only the local church but the Saints at large amen hallelujah so amen if you've seen what's happening amen all around us we can see the signs of the time all around us yes amen and if you noted the continuity of the messages that were coming out and also what is happening in the physical Israel you'll see everything is falling in line amen so there was just something I needed to say Amen on Sunday because I was kind of rushing through the end part you know when the pool is here and then you don't get to your message but then if you notice I took like 5 minutes at the end to explain the Philadelphia Corridor amen so I in my opening statements you remembered I told you that USA under aab Prophet says was typing Israel amen hallelujah so I was trying to show you that the Philadelphia border is affecting physical Israel spiritual Israel which is us and USA and what I meant to tell you was that Philadelphia is very important in the US elections right if you watch if you watch where they held the debate yesterday it was in Philadelphia amen so it's another Corridor they realize in the USA that's the corridor they got to get to win the election physically Israel has got to guard the Philadelphian Corridor and spiritual Israel the six Church AG we've got to guard that brotherly love Corridor amen so you can see all three things are tying in line Lord and one of the things they said that you remember the 100 ostriches were already released now netan if you look listen to his speech he says the moment we attacked Rafa the moment we went after Rafa they released the hostages the moment we went after healing Rafa means healer the moment we engaged healing demon powers up to hallelujah amen hallelujah amen so I just needed to tell you that amen that these three things are happening the Philadelphia amen election amen they must win Pennsylvania Philadelphia to win the election amen and they must guard Philadelphia and if you not to there six hostages were found Philadelphia is a six Church Age The Prophet says it's an overlap to the seventh Church age he says the seventh Church age is a very short age it's a overlap a continuation of that sixth stage which is brotherly love amen and it's very important because you find Brotherly Love is a thing that is lacking amen Brotherly Love is the thing that is lacking but we've got to protect that Corridor we've got to guard that amen let's stand together as we receive amen our brother Jeff who's going to share the word of the Lord amen you just be under expectation amen what the Lord will do amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen thank you Lord oh thank you wonderful savior yes Lord amen father tonight we come expecting you we know Lord you will speak to us through your word your word will never fail us Lord your word is always on time always in season oh God it's always a fresh manner oh God we come Lord with hunger in our hearts anticipation in our hearts now we pray Lord even as we invite our brother to come that you'll take him anoint him Lord even anoint the hearer of the word father For Your Glory and for your honor we ask these things in Jesus name amen we won't take too much time we'll end over the St to brother Jeff amen amen bless your Saints amen you're blessed amen it's good to be back in the house of the Lord amen I missed the service on Sunday but I believe you had a blessed time and I believe that the Lord has been moving amen the Lord is speaking amen amen amen want you glad that we live in an age amen where the Lord does not hide anything from us amen amen we are not living in Gross Darkness like L year amen but we have been called out of L year am amen and the prophets that arise and shine for thy light has come amen so God has illuminated our path amen he's not hid anything from us like in the time of Abraham amen God revealed to Abraham what he was going to do amen God never leaves his elect in the dark amen amen we just want to pray before we get into the word amen if you can just bow our heads thank you Lord hallelujah Glory oh Lord we thank you Lord Jesus that we can be gathered here once again in your presence amen we thank you oh God that there is fullness of joy in your presence Lord there is no depression in your presence oh God there is no sadness in your presence oh god oh there's no sickness in your presence oh God there is no sin Lord in your presence but there is only Liberty oh God there is Victory there is Deliverance oh God and Father we thank you Lord tonight that we can be gathered here Lord father despite Lord the weather despite oh god father we may be tired from work and all of these things oh God but within us Lord there is a groaning to know more within us there is a groaning father to be prepared oh God and Lord so we come into the house of the Lord tonight for instruction oh God we come into the house of the Lord to be equipped oh God and to be built up in faith oh God and right now father even as we go to war because we you know that your Prophet Tau us Lord when the word has been spoken oh God there is a war that takes place in the spiritual realm oh godu and so father right now we take control of every Spirit oh God every hindering spirit that we want to come Lord and hinder the service tonight father we cast it out in Jesus name father for it is written whatever we bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven amen whatever we loose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven and Lord father I pray Lord that the minds of your

break bread oh god father I pray you silence me oh God to my own thoughts my own opinions my own desires oh God and I pray that you will speak tonight in Jesus name father we ask these things oh Lord amen amen hallelujah amen amen let's open to the word of God hallelujah amen let's turn to First Timothy chapter 1 amen so as I said I was not here on Sunday so I did not hear what was preached on Sunday amen so and neither did I listen to the recording because it hasn't been uploaded as yet amen but I'm excited because after preparing my message yesterday I spoke to pastor and he told me that on Sunday he preached on the Amen on the Philadelphia Corridor and the three goals amen and the message that the lord gave me is directly in line with that so you might hear me repeating a few things that you've already heard amen but that's just the angel of the Lord confirming amen because like I said I haven't heard anything of what was preached on Sunday and you will see exactly what has been spoken tonight even by Pastor is even in my notes amen so you'll see that the angel of the Lord is confirming the same thing amen amen amen so let's just be attentive to the Lord you know sometimes the Lord uses can use a different gift to bring things in different ways amen but the inspiration is drawing from the same Fountain amen so first Timothy 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the Commandment of God Our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ which is Our Hope verse two unto Timothy my my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ Our Lord so Paul is addressing this letter this letter to Timothy and he's calling Timothy his own son in the faith in other words Timothy had come into a place of sunship to Paul Timothy had come into a place of adoption amen he had come to a sunship amen Verse 18 Paul now says uh to him this charge I commit unto thee and again he calls him son according to the prophecies which went before on thee am man so Paul is telling him that there's been prophecies over your life yes there's been prophecies that has gone on over this bride amen Hallelujah that thou by them by what by those prophecies mightest War a good Warfare amen amen so Paul is telling him you are not called to a flowery bed of ease but Paul is telling him you are called to Warfare amen and he saying by these prophecies that have been prophesied over your life why good Warfare so the bride of Christ now is coming into sunship coming to adoption and there's been prophecies over this bride yes amen but by those prophecies now this bride is called to Warfare amen this bride is called to spiritual war amen she is not called yet just to play church amen but she is called into spiritual warfare amen so God add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated amen amen amen and for a topic tonight we want to just speak on strategic Warfare instructions from the captain of the host amen amen instructions from the captain of we know who the captain of the host is is the Angel of the Lord and we know who the angel is because we've been walking with him amen we connected to the angel amen and in this end time there has to be a connection to that angel amen there can't just be a connection to a church messenger there has to be a connection to the angel who brought the message to the messenger amen so Paul here is amen can I say handing over the the batt to to his son Timothy he's referring in referring to him in sunship because Paul you know was the first church a messenger and he was like a fatherly figure to Timothy yeah and Paul brought him up into spiritual maturity teaching him the foundational things of Christianity bringing him into a strong foundation so that he could grow up spiritually amen amen yes and so now when Paul is addressing this letter to him he is telling him that amen he is charged amen he's giving Timothy a charge amen it's just not a normal letter but he's giving him an instruction a charge yes and he's saying that you have to fight a good Warfare amen amen you cannot just sit with what I've thought you but you have to fight this war amen amen now you'll find usually in adoption there is usually a passing of the Baton there's usually a passing over you know in the when when we hear of the parable of adoption in the old tradition the father when the son comes up to a stage of maturity the father now wants to pass on the Baton to the son he wants to pass on the business the family name and so forth The Inheritance to the son there's a passing on and in so doing he passes he passes on his inheritance he passes on his status he passes on his authority amen and we find that this pattern happens throughout the Bible you'll see for example with Elijah and Elisha Elijah now passes on the mantle to Elisha and so Elisha is now robed with this mantle amen he's passing on the Baton to him and now Elisha is able to fulfill a double portion of the ministry because the Bon has been passed to him amen you'll see that for example in Jacob and Joseph Jacob puts on a Cod of Many Colors on on Joseph and he passes on the B to Joseph and we know Joseph tpes Perfection Joseph comes up into spiritual maturity into Perfection you see there's always a passing on in adoption you see with Moses and Joshua Moses passes on the torch to Joshua and then Joshua comes into an Ephesian amen Joshua comes into spiritual maturity Joshua comes into his position and then when he comes into his position he's able to speak he's able to control things the the he's able to control nature he's able to fight Wars am but notice how when the Baton is passed and adoption comes it brings you to Warfare [Music] amen amen so just like that now Paul now he's passing it on to Timothy and he's saying I charge you to fight a good Warfare but you're not just to fight anyhow you are to fight this Warfare with the prophecies that has already gone over your life amen amen because there's prophecies that this bride will be an invincible Army Hallelujah you see there's prophecies amen that this bride amen that Satan will not be able to touch this bride he said this bride will not fall like the first bride did amen amen but there's prophecies that this bride will succeed will overcome because the Bible says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit on my Throne so who is to fulfill that it's the bride of Christ so as the blood is coming into adoption there's a there's been a passing on you see there was a prophet in the age who came to spiritual maturity as the first wave sheep being waved amen he comes so much into spiritual adoption that amen even one day he started to have a body change amen amen he started to have an experience of a change amen but amen God had to take him off the scene but in so doing he passes on the torch to us amen the Bride of the age because he said the bride under a Messenger will be the final voice to the final age so he passes on the torch to the bride of Christ and so the bride in this passing over now also has to come into adoption but why because she has to come into spiritual warfare there's a war that's taking place and you cannot have little children fighting in a war they've got to be spiritually mature Sons and Daughters of God they've got to be trained in battle amen they've got to be experienced amen they got to have a backside of a desert experience David before he could face Goliath had to have his experiences now that was the difference that is what gave David the confidence to go and face Goliath it might have been a different story maybe if David never had no experiences but now David was able to go into war because of those experiences you see so in order for you to get into this war you have to come into spiritual adoption you cannot come as a baby in Christ and now go straight into battle the Lord takes you through a training camp and who's the general of the army amen is the Angel of the Lord amen he starts you off on boot camp because who's the guide who's the choor amen starts you up from a young age and and he's bringing you up bringing you up but when you reach a certain level where you are not able to enter the Army to fight amen he's no longer a tutor he's not the general of the army and now he's giving out Maring orders amen amen and now you have to take marching orders if you are in the Army amen you cannot have a soldier who's trying to pull rank yes amen you cannot have a soldier who's disobedient to the general amen yes because why the general has a plan the general is has a strategic Warfare the general has a strategic method of how to take over territories yes amen the general also has the most experience in the camp amen he's fought many wars he's had many victories sometimes this might be a soldier's first war but he is not alone he is under a general amen who has had many wars in fact this General has had no defeats amen he's only known Victory amen amen aren't you glad so when you are facing trials now when you are facing battles know that there's a general standing with you that has not known defeat amen amen hallelujah so you cannot be defeated amen but you have to follow the General's orders now sometimes the general might give you orders that you might not like it might not be easy orders sometimes a general might ask the soldier to go beyond Enemy Lines hey man it's not an easy thing in fact sometimes it can feel like a suicide mission to go beyond Enemy Lines but there is a reason for the order amen and if you come under obedience to the general you are sure bound to win the war amen amen there's there's strategic operations coming down amen maybe sometimes there's an operation Amen to tactically go into a specific unit to do a specific rescue amen it sounds like a dangerous thing to that Soldier but he is relying in the in his confidence in the general amen amen I don't know if you've seen soldiers but they have extreme confidence in their leaders in fact they obey their leaders more than they will maybe even the president they General to them is more than the president amen the Commandments that they receive amen they follow it as is you have to have confidence in his orders amen now imagine going to war and you don't have confidence in your general imagine the amount of fear you're going to have going into war but you because you don't have confidence in the one that's leading you amen a typical example is Saul amen he was so fearful there that the Israeli Army could not have confidence in him against Goliath they could not have confidence in him why because he are so fearful but when David come in the camp and he did what he did am man he slayed Goliath then they were able to have confidence and then they were able to go and attack the armies yes amen see so you got to have confidence in who is leading you so that is why in this hour it is so important to know who is leading you amen there should be no Shadow of Doubt in your mind that the angel of the Lord is present amen there should be no Shadow of Doubt amen that the angel of the Lord is leading us because the moment you doubt that you've already lost the wall yeah the moment you the moment you doubt that Satan has got the victory over your life amen amen now as I said on Sunday you've already heard amen Pastor speaking on Amen the Philadelphia Corridor and these goals that the the prime minister of Israel had set amen and we just want to talk about it just a little bit just as a revision amen just to amen affirm those things that have been said and maybe the angel might even the angel of the Lord might bring it in a different light tonight amen amen so we know that when Israel went to war when Joshua for example was leading Israel he was not leading Israel alone the angel of the Lord met him right yes and the angel of the Lord came as the captain of the host yes so Joshua is able to win all of his Wars because the angel of the Lord was with him amen amen now we know that the angel of the Lord also now is still working Amen in natural Israel yes now you might say why is the Angel of the Lord working in natural Israel they are not serving God remember natural Israel might not necessarily be the 144,000 meaning the armies the soldiers and so forth we don't know who the 144,000 is so you might ask okay but then why would the angel lead them amen now we know in the Book of Revelation the Bible tells us that the angel is the one controlling the Ws he's the one that's holding back the Ws and holding the winds and strife so the angel has to be in control of what's going on because if the angel is not in control World War I can SP can spark sooner than it should because the angel is instructed to hold back the Ws and the winds and strife amen amen so he has to be in control of what's happening because World War I cannot happen until the bride leaves the scene yes and until the 144,000 are sealed amen amen so has to be in control of what's happening because if the W was just left to man and man in his own Wicked devices World War I would have already taken place because man is continually evil because they've already got the artillery to spark World War I so what's holding them back is the Angel of the Lord so we know he is in control of what is happening so when you see for example the video of prime minister uh uh netan speaking you should know that if he is giv tactical instruction and goals of what they want to accomplish in a natural War you should know that the angel of the Lord is basically telling us the same thing in the spiritual realm amen he's accomplishing the same thing in our spiritual warfare yes amen amen now we don't have to go into the the digital footprint of the Angel amen amen and and how long the video was you can see by the very contents of it that the angel of the Lord is is directing things amen so if we go over it you know before we go into these goals that he was talking about you know the the other thing that we've been speaking about over the weeks is the image that we've come up to which is the image of Kings and Priests amen now if you notice the image of kings and and Priests both are involved in war yes because the king is the one that leading the war and the levitical order the priesthood is the one that goes first in the war so the image that God is bringing you up into Kings and Priests is an image for war it's an image that's putting you in war amen and now you know when the prophet had the preview of the bride now here he is seen the preview of the Bride but what were they marching to yes Onward Christian Soldiers amen so this bride is marching unto War amen amen it's not a bride that is here Amen to look just pretty amen all in a bride's outfit it's a bride that is prepared for walk it's a bride that is an invincible Army she's a force to be reckoned with amen amen yes H amen now even in our own lives you know we're talking about the bride collectively but even in our own lives we are called to war every day yes you know the very lives we live every day we are facing trials the prophet tells us we have an enemy amen we have amen someone that we is opposing us every day from the time we wake up till the time we go to bed we have an enemy that is opposing us yes amen opposing us through our very own flesh sometimes amen it doesn't just have to be someone else opposing you sometimes he opposes us through our own flesh through our own mind yes and we're going to talk tonight later on about the tactics of the enemy amen because if you are going into war with an enemy you have to know the enemy's tactics amen you can't go into a w blind amen you have to have you know in in why you get secret intelligence that will come and tell you what the enemy is doing they are able to go into Beyond Enemy Lines like Joshua and Caleb for example they're able to spy out what the enemy is doing and they come back with secret intelligence so that now you can prepare for war and and even we read in the in Kings how the King was angry because God was telling Elisha what what what the King was speaking in his bedroom and everything that he was plotting and planning God was telling Elisha and we had a prophet in this day amen that could tell us what the enemy is plotting could expose the enemy's tactics so that now when we as the bread go to war we are not going unprepared amen amen we know exactly what his tactics are amen amen so here the prime minister is is addressing the people and you know he he starts off there by by saying something very interesting can just get that he says I want to talk to you today about some of the things we must do to achieve the goal right and and he says what is it is to extricate evil from our midst now he's emphasizing that this is something we must do yes you see extracting Satan from our lives is something that we must do getting rid of the enemy in our lives in the church in the bride of Christ is something we must do it is not optional amen it's something that we must do amen when the enemy has laid all of these attacks against the bride of Christ against our families against our own lives what we must do is get rid of the enemy yes yes amen we are not called to negotiate with the Enemy amen we are not called to talk peace talks with the Enemy amen this bride is called to destroy the enemy amen not to negotiate because remember the prophet told us don't try and see how close you can get to Satan don't try and see how close you can play around with sin he said because the enemy will take you for a further ride than you anticipated amen but now our job is not to negotiate with him mess around with him but to destroy him yes so he says this is something we must do amen we must get rid of Hamas that's what he says yes amen and then he goes into uh into the goals and stuff but he says how did this thing start off he says it started off when we let go of the borders because they were once in control of the borders right you would have heard this on Sunday I'm sure they were once in control of the borders but they began to let go of these borders after the 2005 disengagement agreements amen so just like that the prophet had laid up the borders because he's given us the full word amen he laid out Church order and Doctrine he laid out all the borders for us amen amen but they come a laxing amen because of the spirit of lateria they come a relaxation because of the spirit of the age and what happened people started to let down the borders amen we started get lukewarm in the message now we're not talking about the church world tonight we're not talking about the denominations they are already a curse system amen he not going to do us any good to talk about them anymore amen we are interested in the bride of Christ we are interested in the message of the hour and you find that the people began to let down the bars amen the things that they once stood for in the early years where they stood strong people began to get relaxed in it and now that leave room for the enemy to come in yes amen now you can think of various examples of where they let down the borders amen all the way down from the individual life amen to the church itself locally amen and to the body of Christ you can think of various examples they let down the bars in Doctrine started to come up with strange teachings started to come up with strange doctrines amen preachers want to make a name for themselves instead of equipping the people amen the preachers want to start to make a name for them the they get some good inspiration they want to think highly about like something good about but meanwhile God is just trying to bring a word to his people but they start to get it up in their head amen and so instead of the people getting equipped amen the man is elevated amen various examples of sin creeping in the church amen you all around the world you begin to see sin creeping in the message of the hour you begin to see people amen letting down the bars amen like the prophet used to sing that song Amen we let down the bars we let down the bars amen and that's how the gods got in and that's how Hamas got in amen and before that they were not able to smuggle in weapons and all of these things amen because Israel was in control of it amen but when they let down the when they let the corridors go now they started to bring in all the weapons bring in all the missiles and bring in all of these things that they were controlled before not to do and now when they brought in these things the very same things now that they settle smuggling is being used to combat Israel amen and we know that when we are allow sat now remember the prophet said that Satan cannot touch you as long as you sealed with the Holy Ghost and the prophet says that the only way that Satan can get to you is if you come out of the the Holy Ghost and you remember the prophet said now you can grieve the Holy Ghost is that right and he said the Holy Ghost is a gentleman and when you grieve him he takes his flight and the prophet said then you got to pray him back amen so so you see so by letting down the bars that's how we let Satan in so long as we were sealed and we remained in the Holy Ghost we remained within our safe corridors the enemy was not able to get in but the prophet says Dre back amen amen don't live without the Holy Ghost amen there should be a continual check amen to see whether we've grieve the Holy Ghost because remember the prophet says as long as we are living in this pierced house amen there's going to be things we do sometimes that we don't want to do like Paul says the thing that I hate I find myself doing and when we do that we grieve the Holy Ghost but we got to pray him back into our lives we got to check constantly is the Holy Ghost in me we got to check constantly have I grieve the Holy Ghost have I said something that has grieved him I have I done something that has grieved him don't live without the Holy Ghost Amen in fact there shouldn't be a day that the Holy Ghost is not Upon Us amen every second every hour amen meditates upon these things amen amen because the Holy Ghost is our protection it's our seal oh amen remember when the seal is upon the car it cannot be touched until it reaches its destination amen so they began to let down these corridors and that's how the the enemy got in amen and so he says the first goal amen when he goes now into the goals he says the first goal is to destroy the enemy yes and to destroy its military power his military might which is Hamas amen right that's I'm pretty sure amen you'll know now what the goals are and we already know amen what's been preached the last few weeks amen we were instructed by the angel of the Lord to utterly kill and destroy amen amen you see we cannot leave leave room for the enemy to remain you know when Israel went into war like under Saul and God instructed him to destroy everything yes yes and Saul would be disobedient and he wouldn't obey God and sometimes he'll keep maybe he'll keep the slaves or the woman or the the the spoils and Riches of the land but God's instruction is to utterly destroy amen amen it's to disintegrate amen you know like the prophet said when you take your sin and you put it like that ink in that uh bottle of ink uh the bleach it utterly disintegrates it amen so they ought to be amen utter destroying of the enemy yes they shouldn't be amen the enemy in our lives amen we shouldn't give room for the enemy in our lives that's what I'm trying to say Amen in fact we've had enough of the enemy we've had enough of him trying Amen to work in our lives we've had enough of him trying to bring sickness Upon Our Lives we had enough of him trying to bring false doctrin into the church amen we've had enough of him trying to rob our inheritance amen because every time the enemy amen wants to bring doubt wants to bring reasoning he is robbing you of your inheritance because if he can get you to live under fear if he can get you to live amen under stress and anxiety Then you can't operate in faith amen and the only way you can access your inheritance is to operate in faith amen amen so if we leave the enemy to continue with these things we are going to be robbed of our inheritance amen amen and you see Israel by leaving these enemies amen it eventually resulted in this massacre of October 7th and the continued was since then yes and they brought it upon themselves by letting down the borders amen so we got to destroy the enemy amen now if you going to amen what's the what's the next goal then the ne the next goal is said was to rescue the hostages that were taken amen the the next goal was to rescue those that were taken on October 7th now the angel is giving Specific Instructions yeah we are called amen not to just sit amen and and to hear the word but we got to go after our brothers and sisters because Abraham when lot amen was taken captive Abraham got to work he began to get all of his servants he began to get into a time of of warfare amen and he went to rescue lot now Abraham could have said amen this lot you know lot hadn't come in amen lot chose to go down to Sodom and he chose to get lukewarm and he chose to uh go that route so he must live with it but no Abraham having a spirit of Christ upon him which is a spirit to save which is a savior spirit amen went to rescue lot amen even in the time when God wanted to destroy Sodom and gomorra Abraham pleaded yes so we are called Amen to rescue the hostages yes now some of us some of us get the wrong attitude sometimes you know when someone begins to backslide or or they fall into sin or maybe they leave the church they leave the message and we begin to talk about them instead of being concerned instead of going to rescue amen we begin to talk about them we say no this person look how he left the message yeah maybe this person was not called we say look how this person fell in sin they claim to be in the message see see how this person fell in sin or look at that Minister his son he's preaching the church but a son or daughter is doing this what is it we are watching the enemy take our own hostages and instead of going after our hostages we are condemning them now it's not them the enemy is taking remember what is Hamas it's a violent Force the enemy is taking them by violent force and now they are riant on the military force of Israel spiritually Israel to rescue them because remember not everyone is called to be in the Army amen there's a special military force that is designed to rescue hostages amen you you'll find that they have these special forces amen like amen the special force in USA they call the Delta Force they were spe specifically designed to go into certain conditions like where they are to go into Pakistan to find Ben Laden amen they are these special forces that are trained to go beyond Enemy Lines to rescue hostages or to kill terrorists amen they're specifically trained for that so when we find now our own is taken by hostage these special forces that is there now to rescue them amen amen you've got intercessor you got someone who is skilled with the word amen that can take the word and maybe bring back bring them back by the word amen you got someone who is amen skilled in interceding you got someone that is skilled at fasting you got all of these different spiritual forces but instead of going to these forces to rescue the hostages we condemn them amen now remember we know all the stories in the Bible Esther amen was preserved for a time of preservation to save life amen and notice when Abra when Abraham went to meet lot uh sorry went to rescue lot he went into Warfare and upon his victory who did he meet he then comes to King and priest am he then comes to the image it's linked to Warfare amen oh yes you see he then after having the victory he meets mezd amen King and priest amen but he had to go into spiritual warfare amen or should I say for him natural Warfare but for our spiritual warfare it's linked to the image it's linked to your adoption amen but you have to rescue the hostages amen we cannot leave now imagine and some of us maybe would have said this as well when uh October 7th when they were taken captive they said look at these Israelites they were at a rave party they deserve it why they were there having partying and being in the world and having a rave party they deserve it now imagine Israel sit back and say no we're not going to rescue them party in the world they in a r party we don't need to rescue them is that the approach that Israel took no no Israel said they are our own amen it was their nationality yes amen and as the bride we have a nationality we have Heavenly origion Hallelujah am we have the same nationality so no matter whether they fell in sin whether they left the church whether they did this whether they did that amen our job the instruction is remember the instruction is coming out from the general of the army rescue the hostages amen amen your family members that maybe are not saved it is your duty to rescue them amen amen did not Paul say by the unbelieving husband the wife will be saved by Sorry by the believing husband the unbelieving wife will be saved and vice versa it is your duty to save them don't leave them to die yes remember you we might condemn them and say oh they're not in the message they don't believe like we believe see how they love see how they dress but what they're taken by a violent Force amen and we are the military to take it back amen amen Hallelujah so amen the instruction from the angel is rescue the hostages amen what was the next goal amen the next goal amen was to sorry amen when he comes to the next goal I'm paraphrasing he says the next goal is to ensure that this never happens again amen they are not going to give Hamas amen this opportunity to do it again now what I find interesting you know or before we get to that amen this is why when when when we have a victory amen or even in Divine Healing when you have healing or when you are delivered of an evil spirit the prophet said now that evil spirit goes around yes and if he comes back and the strong man of the house is not there he comes back with seven worst demons amen so what he saying now is now that we've taken back the corridor we've taken back amen these territories we cannot give it back because if Hamas comes back then and we are not there to control it Hamas is going to get stronger and they're going to do what and remember what Hamas mission is to continue with the massacre they said they are not going to stop with it yes so that is why the prophet teaches us when you are delivered of a spirit you got to make sure the strong man of the house is there you got to make sure you receive the Holy Spirit you got to make sure that you are sealed amen because you got to ensure man that the territory now think now about the territory that we've been taking back in recent services in recent weeks in recent months think about the lands that we have been taken back think about the territory we've been taken back you cannot leave that unguarded now amen it doesn't mean because you took it over that's the end of it amen you got to protect it now you got to protect what you took back because it was yours in the first place it was your inheritance in the first place so you got to guard it now so that the enemy cannot take it again yes oh yes Lord because if you don't he's going to come back with more ammunition he's going to come back with more demon Spirits amen now what is the enemy's military might the prophet says that there's been 200 million demons Unleashed upon the earth now this is the enemy's military might and this is what is Waging War against us every day that is why you got to keep your borders guarded the territory that we have taken back the Holy Ghost Divine Healing and all of these things now you know Pastor made mention of Rafa and I had this in my notes it's very interesting because they say that all along when they were trying to make deals with Hamas Hamas didn't want to release hostages yes but the moment they took Rafa yes he said they felt the pressure and they began to release hostages amen and the moment we connected with the angel of the Lord the first thing we took back was Divine Healing amen amen the first thing we took back if you remember last year what was the first thing we took back last year was Divine Healing we said far too long the church has gone on without Divine Healing in fact The Message Church began to get so lukewarm the enemy had them so wrapped up that they began to think Divine Healing is not does not even apply to us amen they began to say you know they can wrap it up very nicely he began to say no Divine Healing was for the you know the prophet's day he had the first pull he had this gift you know they can wrap it up very nicely yes but remember if there's no Divine Healing there is no Resurrection if there's no Divine Healing there's no Rapture because you can't have faith for a Rapture if there's no faith for Divine Healing yes now that is not conditional yes that is a guarantee if you do not have faith for Divine Healing you will not have faith for a Rapture you will not have faith for a body change because Divine Healing is the earnest of the body change so if you are saying Divine Healing was only for the prophet what you are saying is that the Rapture is only for the prophet what you are saying is that the body change is only for the prophet and yes he will rise he will have a body change but what about you yes amen you've got to have faith for it right So Divine Healing was the first thing we took that is why Divine Healing is so important it's because it's the earnest of the body change and that is the first territory we took back and I want you to notice that the moment we took back that territory the enemy now in the Demon World started to feel the pressure yes yes amen amen started to feel the attacks amen started to feel our military might because now the bride now started to get a confidence about herself amen the bride was no longer scared yes Lord the bride was no longer an invisible Army she was now an invincible army yes amen the bride started to take back territory and the enemy began to say what is happening here now we thought we had them yes amen we thought we took that territory of Divine Healing what is happening we thought we had them convert that Divine Healing was only for the prophet we thought we had them convinced that Divine Healing is only a minor so we don't have to Major on a minina amen but the bride began to take it back oh yes now notice he said how do they take over Rafa he said they took over Rafa with air strikes and which animal kills it pray from the air air strikes amen the eagle amen it's an eagle amen so eag anointing come down in this age am Amen to take that raer withes amen what is the eagle anointing amen which is the anointing to see the anointing to understand the anointing to perceive what the word of God is saying that these promises are for us amen is the eagle anointing with air strikes amen that could take over Rafa Hallelujah and notice when they now when they take over Rafa the in fact let's read this article because I find this article very interesting this is another this is another article so on 6 May 2024 Israel began a military offensive in and around the city of Rafa as part as part Israel initially planned to launch a two division sweep across the se you have to have the Dynamics and the mechanics Amen to operate Divine leing you can't only have one because it's a supernatural happening amen so you have to have the Dynamics and the mechanics but notice this now but this is what Israel wanted to do but US President Joe Biden considered a major attack into Rafa a red line now we know who America is typing and who does America speak on behalf of Amen we know the Beast amen who he's speaking on behalf of Amen it's the system amen of the Antichrist system amen the Beast amen and he now says Israel must not do this because a major attack on Rafa is a red line that cannot be crossed so this system now hey man this beast and this dragon is saying no you cannot get get Divine Healing back it say no you can have every other thing you can have you know you have all these teachings you have the word you have the Mysteries and all of these things but you cannot get the supernatural back it's a red line you cannot cross that is what they are saying and now look they forced Israel to reduce the operation to capturing the border to seal off arms smuggling into Gaza and and rely on targeted raids into Rafa so pressure come from the system now remember how does Rome control the world it's not just the pope coming and saying do this do that they control it through the system of the whole world it's in politics it's in the job world it's in education it's in Hollywood it's everywhere that's how they control everything right so they began to put the pressure so that our spiritual Israel is not forced to take a backseat now they don't want to engage with the supernatural they don't want to engage in Divine Healing but look Israel now sends because the whole of Israel can't do it they can't go with such a big attack they send targeted raids into Rafa amen targeted forces because certain groups of people began to realize who they are certain groups of people began to realize that the Supernatural is for us certain groups of people begin to realize amen that there's another Unseen World with us and that there's a connection to the Unseen World so that we can do a targeted raid to Rafa amen amen amen so so they began never mind the rest the rest of the church world might not get into the supernatural as yet never mind the rest of the messy churches might not get into the supernatural as yet but a spiritual targeted raid has happened amen and that cannot open the door for the rest to come in amen now this is the time when you know our Heathen Nation so that Africa and this was the time when they started to take Israel out to the international court of justice and and and things like that and we know that whoever blesses Israel is blessed whoever curses Israel is is cursed so our country is cursed amen that is why you know we if you're trying to to succeed in the natural in the economy of South Africa now if you relying on your own strength if you relying on your own merits your qualifications your degree and your job and all of these things you're going to utterly fail because now South Africa is cursed the economy is cursed everything is cursed the only way you can succeed is by Gyra by relying on Gyra not relying on South African economy because they are cursed yes amen amen but there's something there's something I want to see about sou South Africa when I come to a court uh later on about what they did here amen so those were the goals now that that the Prime Minister amen said that this is what they want to achieve now in in in the spiritual and I don't want to be too much longer I just want to go through some quotes amen just to to show you amen the enemy's tactics amen so that we are prepared for it but just to say in the spiritual there has to be goals that we need to achieve in this war in this fight there has to be things that we have to achieve we're not living here aimlessly amen God is not the author of confusion he doesn't do things haphazardly and there's a reason why he sent the captain of the host amen there's specific things he wants to achieve so we got to be aligned with these goals we got to come into connection with the angel so we are aligned with what God wants to achieve amen now if you're only going to be focused on achieving your own goals achieving what you want to achieve in this life then you're not going to be aligned with his goals amen and if you're not going to be aligned in his goals how are you going to benefit from when he takes back territories you're trying to achieve things in this natural life he is showing you now hey I'm taking you to achieve territories where you can speak things territories where you control things territories where you don't have to go and now you want to do things in the flesh and try and obtain things in the natural he's showing you spiritual laws like Jesus said take no thought for what you would eat or or wear tomorrow these are spiritual laws that he's bringing to you to say don't focus on those things focus on my goals the kingdom focus on what I want to achieve because when you do that then you have access to all of these things when you focus on the kingdom goals you start to have access to everything you have need of because the prophet says every Redemptive blessing was paid for amen now just to go very quickly on what are the enemy's tactics amen we are fighting we said 200 million demons but there tactics that he works by and remember we said how we had a prophet in this day who could expose the tactics yes and the prophet now started to preach demonology and started to show us how the enemy Works he started to show us how the how the enemy Works firstly In the Flesh realm amen through sickness amen and how he can bring sicknesses and he shows us now how sicknesses start to start amen how a demon Spirit man is's just waiting there for some kind of opening in your body to try and pervert he's showing us the tactics of the enemy yes amen then for example a cancer he says can start off from just a bruise the enemy he says there's white soldiers they're trying to heal that that portion of your body that was cut but then the demon Spirit tries to infiltrate that and then he starts to multiply cell upon cell these are his tactics of how he gets us in the flesh and the prophet is exposing this amen because then if we know how he operates we know how to combat him because then we know if the if he if sickness is a spirit we know that okay then that's the easy solution Jesus said we have the authority to cast out Spirits yes amen if that's the tactic the enemy wants to work by then we have a tactic of how to go on the offensive amen we don't have to live with that sickness we can bind that sickness we can cast out that evil spirit yes see these are the tactics of the enemy now we got to know how to combat that yes and then he says the enemy now can also work in the in in your spirit in your mind and he starts to bring doubt and reasoning or he starts to bring complexes upon you amen you start to feel all these complexes like everything is against you the world is against you your parents are against you everyone's against you he starts to make you doubt yourself amen the moment you do something wrong he's there to pounce at you and say see you said you're a Believer but you did this what it's the enemy's tactics and the prophet now is showing us how to combat that and remember our our strongest weapon is this amen cuz when the enemy comes and tells us no you see how you sinning see how you fell you're not a child of God but you can say but there's no condemnation Amen to them who are in Christ Jesus amen he that is born of God cannot commit sin you are only lying amen amen but that's how the enemy Works amen maybe you went to some kind of a hard relationship maybe it's a boyfriend and a girlfriend and you broke up and had a a big heartbreak now the enemy wants to use that wants to use that to open up that soul in your heart amen and many times you think oh you know it was just a natural relationship and you know it never work out and you think in in lines of Hollywood but no it's something that the enemy use to bring hurt in your heart amen it is something that because these are his tactics it is something that the enemy is using to break your heart because once you break your heart amen there's no faith there now because you're depressed you start now watch how the moment they go to these youngsters go to break up now they start to get suicidal thoughts they started to get all these thoughts they're not good enough they feel they're not good enough because they were rejected they feel that maybe um they are inferior all of these thoughts now start to build up because the enemy is playing now using this as a tactic because if he can get you to doubt yourself from the natural then how do you progress in the spiritual he's playing with your reasoning he's playing with your mind he's playing with your spirit but these are tactics of the enemy amen so don't be deceived by the tactics of the enemy cuz Jesus said he is the one that heals the Brokenhearted amen amen so don't be deceived by tactics you know that's what he uses you know the prophet said for example an ungodly woman is a tool in the hands of the enemy in fact he said she is designed by him for that purpose is to tear you down you see these are the tactics that the enemy uses then to go on further into demonology the prophet then says now the enemy also works in the religious realm amen and we know how amen sorry I just need to put my password here you know how the enemy works in the religious realm and leaving aside the denominational world the enemy started to creeping into the message realm started to bring all these false teachings false doctrines and making you believe all these amen things that the prophet never said right he this is his tactics of how he's working in demonology and amen let's let's just go through a few quotes amen so we amen can see what the prophet says about it amen the prophet says and demons are tormentors that torment us now there is demons that comes into the soul of man and and that is in the phraseology that would be the demon that comes into the soul is something that t tments the soul and the prophet says now all sickness we find first that all sickness comes from the devil God is not the author of sickness amen so get out of your mind amen that God Amen God allow yes God allows it but God never bring it upon you that's what I'm trying to say no sickness comes from God God sometimes permits Satan to put sickness on you as a whooped to bring you back so this is the only time that God permits sickness upon you is when you went away remember we said Satan can only get you if you leave the Holy Ghost so because of that God puts him upon you as a who to bring you back into the house of the Lord amen but any other time if you are serving God Faithfully then that is not God allowing sickness upon you that is the enemy attacking you amen it comes from the devil God permits death because of disobedient God permits death as one writer said all that death can do God harnessed into a buggy and pulls us into the presence of God a Believer so God as well never bring death he permits it but he never bring death yes and that is why he saying God because he never bring death and because he permits it he harnessed the power of death to bring you into his presence as a open door now the prophet says well that's the same thing takes place when a demon is cast out of a sick person the first few days now we know this how the prophet say you start to feel good amen you start to feel like you well you are healed you start to feel all those things but after a few days you start to feel worse and the prophet is explaining to us that that is the time we got to believe the most amen because in fact that is proof that you've been healed when you start to feel worse because the spirit has left that body the demon Spirit has left that body and whatever is in there needs to die out but in the moment you doubt there that's when the demon comes back and the prophet said he comes back with worse Spirits yes yes right and now when we talking about this don't only think about your normal sicknesses think amen God has healed us from spiritual Amnesia God has healed the body of Christ God has healed us from all of these things of doubting the word and doubting amen who we are and God has healed us of all of that but the moment you give room for Satan he's going to come back with more doubt more reasoning amen now this is what I wanted to get to about South Africa remember I said that South Africa very strangely was the one to go and take Israel to court sorry so South Africa very strangely was the one to go and take Israel to a court right and now let's see why South Africa did that amen for those of you who think it was just a natural happening or just a coincidental thing it's not amen the prophet is is saying here is he he in the prayer line right and he says how do you do sister our Master is Lovely isn't he now I do not know at this time what's wrong with you but you're a Believer and there's something out in the audience pulling the same way now it's a kindred spirit so the prophet is praying over the sister but there's a kindred spirit in the audience that's pulling the prophecy is pulling him and he says it's something moving the same thing that you have see spirits are Kindred just like you've heard birds of a feather you know the same flock together see they go together and Demon power demonology is works the same manner and you standing here you my sister you suffering and we strangers it's someone sitting right in there with the same thing you have and it's bothering me now Prophet saying it's bothering me in other words it's distracting the prophet yes and the prophet asked the sister and said would you turn this way just a moment you look to me I want to talk to you just a moment kind of get my back to the case so the the prophet turns his back to this other case because it's distracting him and and he says I want to talk to you a moment it bothers me I can't see what it is and it's pulling it's a kindred here here's what it is you are human and I am human and each one of us are are possessed with a spirit and now they in here come to me for Faith and you are suffering and in you is a spirit of sickness or something or whatever it is if I can get you to believe it's got to leave you and that's the reason it fights so that's what makes it such a pull it's got a kindred spirit out they pulling the same way for help the demon Spirit knows it's in trouble because you've already healed so the prophet is talking about this kindred spirit now why do I bring this is because here is natural Israel now fighting a spiritual war I'm sorry fighting a natural War right and spiritually Israel here South Africa is fighting a war and these demon Spirits now a kindred spirit amen cannot take it so much so that they not they want to go and fight with Israel and take Israel Accord why they have no business to do it but it's a kindred spirit calling for help because they spiritual warfare in the front of South Africa that's happening and they cannot take it in these demon powers cannot take it in the spiritual realm so they are they have to go all the way now to fight natural Israel in the court what other reason do they have there's no other reason but it's because the Demon World is feeling such pressure and remember the prophet said that each each government each King was controlled by Spirits amen now if we are fighting a Warfare yeah who is the leader of the land is the government right besides the president because president changes but it's the government right it's that that offers so if that Spirit cannot take the spiritual violence that's happen to them in their own land they are now calling out for help and now wanting to fight this in natural Israel and that is what the prophet is saying they are kindred spirits and this is why South Africa did this so you see that is why you got to understand who we are in this hour and what we are what we are doing we are not just here playing church we are winning spiritual victories we are taking back spiritual territories we are coning amen don't just think of this as a small now I'm not trying to say that we are the only Pebble amongst the bunch I'm not trying to say that we are unique and God is only moving in us what I'm trying to say is I cannot talk for other assemblies I can only talk for what God is doing here I am present here I know what God is doing here so I can talk for what God is doing here but what I can say is that after months of what God was saying here only after months it started to go around the world because remember everyone Services is recorded so you know what's happening around amen but what I'm trying to say is don't take for granted what God is doing here because we are a small group of people amen the angel of the Lord is here instructing us every week and we are taking back territory every week we are taking back victories every week amen and if I can just get to this quot amen the enemy is making me really struggle with this laptop cuz I don't have my MacBook here today you know I I find these quotes very interesting you know the the prophet sometimes he says things now watch this right now as I said I'm not saying that there's anything unique about us well there is something unique about the whole bride but I'm not saying God is only moving amongst us I'm just talking about what God is doing here amen the prophet is saying then after a while I saw a vision when I was in America and it came to me and I returned me back to Africa it returned me back to Africa and it showed me the same meeting sitting there in front of Durban and the first meeting faded away into history talking about when he came the first time going towards the West the second meeting rose up and when it did it was still larger than the first meeting the first meeting and I heard a scream now this is not just a normal vision you can see that something very unique is happening here he says I heard a scream and an angel was coming out of Heaven talking about Durban now he had a great light and the angel of the Lord which stands by us here always stands by my right over on this side it was standing there where in Durban it was Ming around and I seen this man standing under him he's now the prophet says it's not a vision it's just as real as you are talking to me the man is just standing there just the same as you are and his voice amen as you would hear mine but a vision something that breaks before you the prophet just explains a vision now look in verse very strikingly in verse 23 sorry in chapter uh paragraph 23 he says so he told me what was going to take place and he said that the angel came down and he told me to turn and look this way and I look towards India now I don't say it in India but it's near they were the Indian people in paragraph 23 the angel is saying look this way to Durban the Indian people now many people many Skeptics use this quote to say the prophet was a false prophet because yeah he talks about the meeting of 300,000 people and they use this as a the Skeptics use this to say no it never happened there was no meeting with 300,000 people now what am I trying to say I'm not I'm not trying to say that this is the Fulfillment of that court I'm not yet to make excuses for the prophet or to try and defend the prophet because God backs up his own word god vindicates his word by making it come to pass but what I'm trying to see I'm showing you a type in paragraph 23 is the Angel is telling him turn to Duran to the Indian people and in the year 2023 the angel of the Lord met with us amen and notice he's saying this in demonology in the spiritual realm where I told you he's talking about spiritual warfare in the spiritual realm amen so are we here in Durban fighting a spiritual warfare against the spiritual real and taking back victories amen under the angel of the Lord amen now I'm not going to make a doctrine of that you can think what you want to of it I'm just reading a quote amen so just a last quote Amen in closing amen so we in Warfare and God's Heroes has always had Warfare and you little church remember back here you are part of that you an outpost back here now think of us now you an outpost here in Phoenix you should by being some of it right here by you you an outpost to keep up the banners Amen to do what's right to still claim Jesus

of the move this is these orders we got to carry out orders how could you ever some of you boys served in the war how could you ever the captain give an order and you turn around and do something backwards why you'll mess up the old army that's right you'll throw it into a riot you've got to carry out the orders the only way you can do it is focus it and see the purpose see you got to see the purpose behind it what it's all about we have had many great battles spiritual battles many great V days that the church has had and we have been having amen many great V days amen amen the body of
