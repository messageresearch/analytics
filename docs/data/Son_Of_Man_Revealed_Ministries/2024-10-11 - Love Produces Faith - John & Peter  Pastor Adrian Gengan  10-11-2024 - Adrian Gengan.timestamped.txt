[2:37] preaching at at a church in shellcross
[2:39] this morning amen the church he's been
[2:41] witnessing to this
[2:43] brother and uh they've invited him to
[2:46] come and share the word of the Lord amen
[2:48] and we are praying amen that the word of
[2:49] the Lord will find an Abiding Place even
[2:51] if it's just one seed amen praise the
[2:54] Lord so amen we are remembering our
[2:56] brother there also amen I believe sister
[2:59] elen is in
[3:00] Johannesburg amen so she'll be I'm not
[3:02] sure when she's coming back but we pray
[3:04] the Lord will be with her amen and I
[3:06] pray amen everybody is feeling good in
[3:08] the house of the Lord amen blessed in
[3:10] the house of the Lord let's turn to our
[3:11] Bibles amen even as we welcome you in
[3:14] Jesus
[3:15] name amen we're in part three of our
[3:18] message I'm not someone who normally
[3:20] does series but I had to lay a
[3:23] foundation amen sometimes you got to lay
[3:26] the mechanics before the Dynamics come
[3:29] amen amen and the the heart of this
[3:32] teaching is to equip the man Sons and
[3:35] Daughters of God so that we can
[3:37] Ascend higher dimensions in the Holy
[3:41] Ghost amen we can't be operating with
[3:44] the full opening of the word and still
[3:47] be a powerless
[3:49] Church be nothing like what brother
[3:51] grham said this church would be
[3:53] something is wrong there amen so we are
[3:56] looking into the word and the Holy
[3:58] Spirit is guiding us through the word to
[3:59] show us certain truths about what kind
[4:02] of people we ought to be amen so we were
[4:04] speaking on a three-dimensional being
[4:06] Faith open charity which was the essence
[4:08] of love everybody remember that amen and
[4:11] then last week we took amen we took on
[4:14] faith hope and charity and showed you
[4:16] how it was typed in Peter James and
[4:18] John amen so this morning we're going to
[4:21] look at love produces
[4:23] Faith John and Peter John being the
[4:26] Apostle of love and Peter being the
[4:29] Apostle of faith Faith amen amen let's
[4:31] turn to 1 Corinthians
[4:35] 13:13 1 Corinthians 13:3 says and now
[4:39] abideth faith
[4:42] hope charity which is love these three
[4:47] but the greatest of these is
[4:50] Charity amen now abide it faith hope
[4:54] charity these three but the greatest of
[4:57] these is Charity amen then we're going
[5:00] to get to where we want to get this
[5:01] morning in Acts chapter 3 praise the
[5:08] Lord so that is our foundational
[5:10] scripture there in 1 Corinthians
[5:12] 13:13 so it's not us declaring that love
[5:15] is a higher dimension of the Holy Ghost
[5:17] it's the Bible that's telling
[5:19] you amen that love is a higher Dimension
[5:22] the greatest of these is love so we are
[5:25] in Acts chapter
[5:26] 3 now Peter and John went up together
[5:30] into the temple at The Hour of Prayer
[5:32] being the ninth hour and a certain man
[5:35] lame from his mother's home was carried
[5:37] whom they laid daily at the temple at
[5:40] the Gate of the temple which is called
[5:42] Beautiful to ask arms of them that
[5:46] entered into the temple we seeing Peter
[5:48] and John about to go into the temple
[5:51] asked and arms and Peter fasting his
[5:54] eyes upon him with John said look on us
[5:59] and he gave eat unto them expecting to
[6:01] receive something of them then Peter
[6:04] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[6:07] such as I have give I Thee in the name
[6:10] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[6:14] walk and he took him by the right hand
[6:16] and lifted him up and immediately his
[6:19] feet and ankle bones received strength
[6:22] amen and he leaping up stood and walked
[6:24] and entered with them into the temple
[6:27] walking leaping and praising God
[6:30] and all the people saw him walking and
[6:32] praising God and they knew that it was
[6:35] that it was he which set for arms at the
[6:37] beautiful gate of the temple and they
[6:40] were filled with wonder and amazement at
[6:43] that which had happened unto him amen
[6:46] the Lord had blessings to the reading of
[6:48] his word you may be
[6:53] seated amen we have our notes brother
[6:56] Josh
[6:57] amen so very quickly I just want a
[6:59] background I might take maybe 5 minutes
[7:01] just to hit our highlights amen of what
[7:04] we've been saying because sometimes we
[7:07] tend to forget these things it's not
[7:08] because that we are forgetful it's just
[7:10] that the human mind is like that
[7:12] sometimes amen so we are speaking this
[7:16] morning on love produces Faith amen we
[7:19] were looking at John and Peter the
[7:21] Apostle of love and the Apostle of faith
[7:24] and brother Bram says we we're
[7:26] reestablishing this and maybe it's a
[7:27] good catch up to because brother Kenny
[7:29] Miss some Services wasn't you I believe
[7:31] you were working so it'll be a good
[7:32] catch up for him as well amen so brother
[7:35] Grom says that Faith open charity are
[7:37] not three different things but all the
[7:39] essence of one amen
[7:42] love amen praise the Lord now in our
[7:46] human body we don't see all the out the
[7:49] functions of every member of our
[7:51] body most of the time when somebody's
[7:54] speaking you look at their face so the
[7:56] face becomes a thing that you focus on
[7:58] but yet it takes the entire body to
[8:00] function amen amen like the brain is
[8:03] hidden but the brain is sending all of
[8:05] these signals and
[8:07] speech everybody understand so what when
[8:10] you are seeing love it is inside of it
[8:13] is Faith open charity amen and then we
[8:17] were telling us telling you how we are a
[8:19] three-dimensional being that the flesh
[8:22] is Hope amen uh faith is in the spirit
[8:26] realm but love is in the realm of the
[8:28] Soul
[8:30] amen and we were telling you how we were
[8:32] made in the image of God which is the
[8:34] nature the character the essence of God
[8:36] and God is love so we can't be anything
[8:39] else beside love amen amen when the
[8:42] image is being restored in this time and
[8:44] season we must be everything that love
[8:48] is amen amen so brother brandom again I
[8:52] told you for this five minutes I'm just
[8:53] recapping he says what we need is hope
[8:56] faith charity hope faith charity
[8:59] together
[9:00] God help our church to have it like that
[9:02] the people to have that
[9:05] combination
[9:07] amen he says if you can have faith and
[9:10] hope and love you're near the kingdom of
[9:14] heaven then the three great things God
[9:18] taken those as a confirmation because in
[9:20] the mouth of two or three Witnesses let
[9:22] every word of God be established then
[9:25] again it representing the placing of a
[9:28] son so we also learning that Faith open
[9:31] charity must be there at our adoption
[9:33] ceremony brother BR just confirming it's
[9:36] represented in the placing of a son
[9:39] Peter James and John were taken to Jesus
[9:41] adoption ceremony
[9:45] amen here he says those three elements
[9:48] the sufficient elements to work out
[9:50] every problem the church has you let
[9:53] Faith open charity get in among the
[9:55] people in a church and watch what takes
[9:58] place amen so Faith open charity can
[10:02] work out every problem I say not only in
[10:04] the church but even in your own lives
[10:07] amen if you can use amen this this
[10:10] powers of Faith open
[10:12] charity brother brandom is saying it'll
[10:14] work out every problem in the church he
[10:17] says he manifested his son before all
[10:19] these great elements telling you that he
[10:21] took up Jesus transfigured him before
[10:24] Faith open
[10:26] charity amen if you're reading it say
[10:28] amen amen now I want you to notice under
[10:31] the cloud was three others Moses Elijah
[10:34] and Jesus three is the confirmation
[10:36] confirms anything amen so that's our
[10:39] recap of some of the highlights we were
[10:41] touching on Amen showing you the
[10:43] importance of faith hope and charity in
[10:45] the lives of an individual amen amen
[10:49] praise the
[10:51] Lord now we want to go to our first
[10:53] quote this morning in perfect faith and
[10:55] showing you because we know that Faith
[10:57] cometh by the hearing of the word
[10:59] everybody agree Faith cometh by the
[11:01] hearing of the word so let's hear what
[11:04] brother brandom is saying when you got
[11:06] Pure un adulterate Faith Like Your Love
[11:10] Is to your companion then you prove it
[11:12] by the way you
[11:14] act
[11:16] amen you ain't complaining no more you
[11:18] know it's done just walk along no matter
[11:21] what the thing looks like what anybody
[11:23] else says you know what's happened you
[11:25] know that it's finished just as well as
[11:27] you know you love your husband as well
[11:29] as you know you love probably wants to
[11:31] say your wife see love and faith has to
[11:34] go together they kin folks they love
[11:37] because love produces
[11:40] Faith
[11:42] amen amen so then what is this word that
[11:46] we are listening to because if the Bible
[11:48] is saying Faith cometh by the hearing of
[11:49] the
[11:50] word and brother Bram is saying that
[11:52] love produces his faith then the word
[11:55] has to be a word of love because God is
[11:58] love and and God is no different to his
[12:00] word
[12:01] amen amen so we are finding that this
[12:05] love is producing this Faith within
[12:08] us now remember we can have faith
[12:11] without love and that puts us in the
[12:14] category of Lord we we cast out devils
[12:16] in Your Name Lord we prophesied in Your
[12:19] Name Lord we did many great miracles in
[12:22] your name Jesus says depart from me you
[12:24] workers of iniquity why they didn't have
[12:27] the key ingredient to produce
[12:29] Faith which was love am
[12:35] amen Faith must be based upon the word
[12:37] of
[12:39] God so brother Bram again says the life
[12:42] in the tree produces
[12:45] apples the life in the tree is what
[12:47] produces the apples so it's love in our
[12:50] hearts that's got to produce
[12:53] Faith
[12:55] amen he says brother Brandon do we
[12:58] should we speak with tongues absolutely
[13:01] that's gifts of God but those gifts of
[13:03] God without these virtues in them makes
[13:06] a stumbling block to the unbeliever it's
[13:08] not accepted by
[13:10] God so we don't want to have outward
[13:13] manifestations gifts of the Spirit and
[13:16] not accepted by God praise the Lord amen
[13:20] this has to be
[13:22] first and when you have faith virtue
[13:25] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[13:28] and brotherly love then the Holy Ghost
[13:30] comes down and seals you as a unit the
[13:33] same as he seals the church age as a
[13:38] unit the way he makes his bride is the
[13:41] way he makes his individual made out of
[13:43] the same material like Eve was made out
[13:46] of Adam a rip from the side here is the
[13:49] right here is the things that you have
[13:50] to have first you can't impersonate them
[13:53] you can't imitate
[13:55] them they've got to be God sent and God
[13:58] born imitation causes
[14:01] confusion amen amen so we can't have a
[14:04] message church that's an imitation of
[14:06] the message
[14:07] church amen now remember you must see
[14:10] the manifestation of it praise the Lord
[14:13] amen one more quote before we get into
[14:16] some nuggets here he says the old
[14:19] Christian armor is looking at the Unseen
[14:21] but the senses don't declare those
[14:23] things but they're there that's the
[14:25] reason it takes Faith to believe and it
[14:27] produces in you what faith has declared
[14:29] is out there it brings it to you Divine
[14:32] Healing and things they can't prove what
[14:35] heals divinely but they know there is
[14:37] Divine Healing they can't prove what
[14:40] saves from sin but they know people are
[14:42] saved from sin so it cannot be proven
[14:44] scientifically but it is scientifically
[14:46] in God's way of looking at it so faith
[14:49] is the evidence of Things Not Seen is
[14:51] what we are
[14:52] saying amen praise the
[14:55] Lord now if you notice what brother
[14:57] brandham says that he seal the age
[15:00] with a
[15:01] virtue amen now I want you to know if
[15:05] you are still manifesting brotherly love
[15:07] you need to come up higher because
[15:09] leosia was sealed with that
[15:11] virtue but the bride is no longer under
[15:13] Lan Church age can I get somebody to say
[15:16] amen amen amen if you're sitting under a
[15:18] latan church age and a lan spirit this
[15:21] morning we need to pull you out into the
[15:23] bright age it's the age of love it's a
[15:25] manifestation of God Almighty in and
[15:27] through a people amen amen so when we
[15:30] are looking at Peter and John you may be
[15:33] asking you saying that's faith and
[15:34] charity but they are just showing you
[15:36] the foundation and The Headstone but in
[15:38] between all of that he's lying all seven
[15:42] virtues you are just looking at the legs
[15:44] and you're looking at the
[15:46] air when these two are walking together
[15:50] praise the Lord what is that Faith
[15:52] walking with
[15:54] love praise the Lord amen so we're
[15:58] reading here in the Bible
[15:59] and we are finding that Peter and
[16:04] John just get back to my notes amen
[16:07] praise the
[16:09] Lord when we are looking at Peter James
[16:11] and
[16:13] John how they were a part of Jesus in a
[16:15] circle how many if you remember that
[16:18] Jesus took them into special occasions
[16:20] amen they were called apart for special
[16:22] occasions Peter James and John and Jesus
[16:25] surrounded himself with Peter James and
[16:27] John even in his most important and
[16:29] crucial hours amen so Peter represented
[16:32] Faith James hope and John love
[16:36] charity but locked up in Jesus was the
[16:38] fullness of faith hope and
[16:40] love amen he was the Perfection of faith
[16:44] hope and charity now we notice here I'm
[16:46] going to preach these things because we
[16:47] lay down these foundations now that
[16:49] Jesus only changes three of his
[16:51] disciples names he changes the name of
[16:53] Peter which was Simon amen hallelujah he
[16:57] changes the names of James and John they
[16:59] were called the Sons of zebede but he
[17:01] renames them bonus which means the sons
[17:03] of thunder and it will take these seven
[17:06] Thunders Amen to give the bride Faith
[17:09] amen James and John amen hallelujah
[17:13] praise the Lord so he changes only these
[17:15] three why they are representing Faith
[17:17] open and charity and Jesus is the
[17:20] manifestation of God in flesh so the
[17:23] book is in Jesus so he knows their true
[17:25] character their true identity so he
[17:28] renames them to reflect the Heavenly
[17:31] pattern what they were supposed to
[17:33] reflect on the earth amen cuz your name
[17:36] represents your character right amen
[17:39] praise the Lord so only Faith open and
[17:42] charity receives a new
[17:44] name now remember we said it's one unit
[17:47] and who receives a new name in this hour
[17:50] amen the bride will receive a new name
[17:53] amen praise the
[17:54] Lord so we notice that Jesus Takes Peter
[17:57] I'm going to recap here again for those
[17:59] of you that are not following Peter
[18:00] James and John jesus takes them into the
[18:02] house of Jus that's right and he cast
[18:05] out all unbelief why perfect love will
[18:08] cast out fear amen so when they step
[18:11] into the house all unbelief must leave
[18:13] the house yes amen amen in order to see
[18:15] the miraculous you've got to create the
[18:18] expectation for the miraculous there's
[18:20] got to be no room for doubt no room for
[18:22] fear amen
[18:24] yes expectation breeds a miracle amen
[18:28] even this morning if you expect if you
[18:30] have the expectation in your heart amen
[18:32] you can create the atmosphere for your
[18:34] Miracle this morning amen but you've got
[18:36] to breed it amen you've got to create
[18:38] the atmosphere for it amen praise the
[18:42] Lord amen so what he is showing you here
[18:46] when he takes Peter James and John now
[18:48] remember resurrection of the Dead is no
[18:50] easy thing it takes perfect Faith yes
[18:54] amen so Jesus Takes these three Peter
[18:56] James and John and he takes them to to
[18:59] make them be Witnesses of the
[19:00] resurrection of this girl amen showing
[19:04] us that in the end time it'll be Faith
[19:06] open charity in The Believer again that
[19:08] will witness the resurrection of the
[19:10] sleeping Saints amen amen praise the
[19:13] Lord so Peter James and John are also
[19:15] taken up to the mountain to witness
[19:17] Jesus adoption ceremony amen it is year
[19:21] that the the Lord God says amen this is
[19:23] my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[19:26] hear he him Peter James and John were
[19:29] taken to the most important Supernatural
[19:32] events because it was showing us that
[19:34] when the Romans 8 man is on the earth at
[19:37] the time of the adoption of Sons and
[19:38] Daughters of God faith hope and charity
[19:41] will be in a people who will be adopted
[19:43] amen yes amen praise the Lord because it
[19:47] is a complete
[19:48] unit so Peter James and John were also
[19:51] the ones you can read it in Mark Mark
[19:54] 13:3 Peter James and John take Jesus
[19:57] alone privately and they ask ask him
[19:59] these questions tell us when shall these
[20:01] things
[20:02] be what shall be the sign when all these
[20:04] things shall be
[20:06] fulfilled and he is now answering Peter
[20:09] James and John he's revealing the Hidden
[20:12] Mysteries to only that unit amen amen go
[20:16] and read it Mark chapter 13 it's these
[20:19] three that take Jesus
[20:20] aside Peter James and John so he's
[20:23] revealing the Hidden Mysteries only to
[20:25] Peter James and John faith hope and
[20:27] charity and remember we said it's one
[20:30] unit I'm going to repeat myself so until
[20:32] you get it
[20:34] amen it is also Peter James and John
[20:37] that Jesus asked to go and prepare the
[20:40] Passover you'll read that in Luke CH
[20:43] 22:8 the Last Supper Jesus asked Peter
[20:46] James and John to go Peter and John to
[20:49] go and prepare the Passover praise the
[20:51] Lord in the final hours of Gethsemane
[20:54] Jesus Takes Peter James and John to pray
[20:56] but they fell asleep
[20:58] at the darkest and most agonizing hour
[21:01] of Jesus life he takes Peter James and
[21:04] John but I want you to know it was Peter
[21:07] and John
[21:09] now that are the first
[21:13] disciples you can pick this up in John
[21:16] chapter 20 verse one amen it says early
[21:20] on the first day of the week while it
[21:21] was still dark Mary Magdalene went to
[21:24] the tomb and saw that the stone had been
[21:26] removed from the entrance so she came
[21:28] running to Simon Peter and the other
[21:31] disciple the one who Jesus loved
[21:33] somebody tell me who that
[21:35] is his name is John so she comes running
[21:39] to Peter and John to tell them that the
[21:41] Lord is
[21:44] risen then they had taken the Lord out
[21:47] of the Tomb and she said we do not know
[21:49] where they have put him then Peter and
[21:51] the other disciples set out for the tomb
[21:54] the two were running together what is it
[21:56] showing you the complete unit from Faith
[21:58] to charity
[21:59] is going to meet the resurrected Lord
[22:01] Jesus amen when you see these two
[22:04] operating together you are seeing the
[22:06] complete
[22:08] Church you are seeing the complete
[22:11] statue of a perfect man hallelujah
[22:17] amen they were running together but the
[22:19] other disciple John out runs Peter and
[22:22] reach the tomb first because love must
[22:24] produce
[22:25] [Music]
[22:26] Faith love has got to reach the tomb
[22:29] first and let me tell let me advise as
[22:32] church love has got to reach every
[22:34] situation we Face First amen amen yes
[22:38] Hallelujah in every circumstance that we
[22:40] face if we let love rule that situation
[22:44] you watch the kind of fight that is
[22:46] produced over that
[22:47] situation fight becomes the spokesperson
[22:51] yes but behind it is love that's
[22:53] generating that Faith amen thank you
[22:55] Lord praise the Lord amen so so love
[22:59] outruns Faith and reaches the tomb first
[23:02] he bent down and looked in at the linen
[23:03] clothes right lying there but he did not
[23:06] go in you see love makes the way for
[23:09] Faith to go
[23:10] in who didn't go in John but who went in
[23:15] Peter so isn't that the case in most of
[23:18] our Lives we see somebody operating in
[23:21] faith and all we can see is their faith
[23:24] but the secret behind that faith is the
[23:26] love
[23:29] operating in high dimensions of the Holy
[23:31] Ghost amen praise the Lord
[23:34] amen we find also in Acts chapter 8
[23:37] verse1 14 when the Evangelist philli is
[23:39] having a great Revival and The Souls of
[23:42] the city of Samaria are being saved the
[23:44] disciples hear about this revival and
[23:46] who do they
[23:47] send they send Peter and
[23:50] John these these people that were being
[23:53] baptized needed something more than just
[23:55] water baptism and the Bible says that
[23:58] they sent Peter and John to Samaria and
[24:00] they laid hands on them and when they
[24:02] laid hands they received the Holy Ghost
[24:04] yes amen praise the Lord so water
[24:07] baptism alone is not good enough faith
[24:10] and charity must follow in order for the
[24:12] baptism of the Holy
[24:15] Ghost praise the Lord now the you know
[24:18] it's recorded in the Bible that from
[24:20] Peter James and John the first disciples
[24:23] to be killed the first disciple to be
[24:25] killed was James we'll read that in Acts
[24:28] 12
[24:29] so hope he taken off the
[24:32] scene
[24:34] amen praise the
[24:36] Lord and I would like to suggest to you
[24:39] that when the disciples were sent two by
[24:41] two one represented love and the other
[24:44] represented
[24:46] Faith how many of you know that the
[24:48] disciples were sent out two by two one
[24:51] represented love and one represented
[24:54] Faith praise the Lord amen why one
[24:58] represented love the other represented
[25:00] Faith amen and together this was the
[25:03] most powerful force and when they were
[25:06] when love and and Faith were operating
[25:08] and moving they were meeting the Hope in
[25:11] the
[25:14] person what is hope it's the expectation
[25:18] it's the desire yes so hope was now in a
[25:22] people but they had to look on faith and
[25:25] charity praise the Lord amen amen so
[25:29] that's where that's where we get to now
[25:31] as my opening to Acts chapter 3 and we
[25:33] see Peter and John open the book of
[25:36] Acts and Acts chapter 3 is the first
[25:39] recorded Miracle of
[25:43] healing amen we know Acts chapter one
[25:46] jesus takes him up on a mountain he is
[25:48] translated and he commissions them amen
[25:51] Acts chapter two we know they get into
[25:53] the upper room 120 of them and they are
[25:55] waiting there in
[25:57] expectation we know the Holy Ghost comes
[25:59] in Acts chapter
[26:01] 2 3,000 souls are saved but the first
[26:04] miracle of the church this powerful
[26:07] Church filled with the Holy Ghost is in
[26:10] Acts chapter
[26:12] 3 and it forms the basis of how the the
[26:16] the world is going to react the
[26:17] religious realm are going to react and
[26:19] the church is going to react you find
[26:23] this this thing rocks the church World
[26:25] it rocks the religious realm and it
[26:26] rocks even the political
[26:29] because they thought when they put Jesus
[26:31] to death that was done with this kind of
[26:34] movement yes but now they had found
[26:36] Jesus was back but his name wasn't
[26:40] Jesus his name was Peter and his name
[26:43] was John and they wondered we thought we
[26:46] put to death this Spirit but if the
[26:49] spirit of him that raised Jesus from the
[26:51] dead dwells in you it will also Quicken
[26:53] your mortal body to do the very works of
[26:56] Christ amen so they were looking in
[26:58] amazement here if you read the chapter
[27:01] at now Jesus in another
[27:03] form oh yes and remember what brother
[27:05] brand is teaching us if you're looking
[27:08] for him in another manifestation another
[27:10] form you're going to miss him you've got
[27:12] to recognize him in the way he's
[27:14] manifesting himself now present tense so
[27:17] don't look at the veil look Beyond the
[27:19] Veil amen amen praise the Lord so this
[27:22] is no ordinary miracle that takes place
[27:25] in chapter 3 and it occupies chapter 3
[27:27] and chapter four two chapters it takes
[27:30] up amen hallelujah because like we're
[27:34] saying yeah they shake the Realms of
[27:36] Jerusalem they're shaking the Demonic
[27:38] world because the spirit had to leave
[27:41] this lame man it shakes the religious
[27:44] world that they have performed councils
[27:46] now to now check what's going
[27:49] on and it shakes up the religious world
[27:52] the political world and it shakes up the
[27:54] church yes amen these men are full of
[27:58] the Holy Ghost they heal a man who was
[28:00] crippled from birth amen praise the Lord
[28:04] amen
[28:05] amen in fact the Bible records it you
[28:08] can probably pick it up here Amen in
[28:10] Acts chapter 4 just pick it up very
[28:12] quickly Acts chapter 4: 22 there we just
[28:16] want to show you the age of this
[28:18] man the man was above 40 years old whom
[28:22] this miracle of healing was showed pay
[28:25] attention now how old was the man 40
[28:28] years old how old was Jesus when he
[28:31] died so was this man sitting there when
[28:33] Jesus walked
[28:35] past yes you say how can you say that am
[28:39] man let's show you how I can say that
[28:41] because here in Acts chapter 3 what is
[28:43] he
[28:45] saying Acts chapter 3 tells you that
[28:48] they laid the Man daily at the
[28:51] temple hello amen amen maybe some of
[28:55] them want to seat in the Bible amen
[28:57] praise the Lord
[29:05] Acts chapter 3 verse two I think it is
[29:08] it says and a man who was lay from his
[29:10] mother's wom was carried whom they laid
[29:12] daily at the Gate of the temple which is
[29:14] called Beautiful To Us arms of them that
[29:18] entered into the temple how many of you
[29:20] know Jesus entered the temple many times
[29:22] and if they laid him daily there would
[29:24] this man have been there yes amen but I
[29:28] know Jesus was operating and say John
[29:30] 5:19 the son can do nothing but what he
[29:33] see the father do amen and what the
[29:35] father show the son that do the son
[29:37] likewise so Jesus knew being amen God in
[29:40] flesh he would have known this is not
[29:42] for my
[29:43] Miracle I've got to wait amen for the
[29:46] appointed time when the Holy Ghost is
[29:48] sent back it's going to be the first
[29:49] miracle amen that the church is going to
[29:53] have amen wonderful so he's 40 years old
[29:58] amen hallelujah this man is 40 years old
[30:03] praise the Lord amen he's laying there
[30:06] daily at the temple and we're finding
[30:08] here amen as we go along now that this
[30:11] miracle like we are saying Jesus was
[30:13] saying amen the glory now where were
[30:15] they in front of the temple was the
[30:17] glory once in the
[30:19] temple so what we are presented with in
[30:21] Acts chapter 3 is the glory that was
[30:23] once in the temple was now in Jesus amen
[30:27] but it not move from Jesus into the
[30:29] disciples amen yes amen but watch what
[30:33] they do they don't take the glory for
[30:36] themselves they give the glory back to
[30:38] God so when we are saying the glory is
[30:40] being revealed in you it's to be amen
[30:43] the glory of shakan of Glory is
[30:44] revealing you to give God back the glory
[30:47] amen praise the Lord
[30:52] amen so no doubt this man would have
[30:54] been begging at the temple being 40
[30:56] years old Jesus may have passed him by
[30:58] begging at the temple many times amen
[31:01] would have seen Jesus but Jesus did not
[31:03] heal
[31:04] him amen praise the lord we find here
[31:07] even as we read the chapter now it says
[31:10] Peter and John went up together into the
[31:13] temple at The Hour of Prayer being the
[31:16] ninth hour
[31:19] hallelujah
[31:20] amen what is the 9th hour amen it's 300
[31:24] p.m. they're going into the temple but
[31:27] who's walking
[31:29] there
[31:31] amen it is faith and
[31:35] charity faith is walking with
[31:39] love so if your faith doesn't have love
[31:42] with
[31:43] it you are not going to be that super
[31:46] Church in a super
[31:48] race
[31:50] amen we are looking at the first miracle
[31:52] because this church must be a
[31:53] continuation of the book of Acts
[31:55] Hallelujah everybody understand that
[31:57] amen amen praise the Lord so they're
[32:01] going at the n9th hour of the day this
[32:03] is
[32:04] amen maybe many people are not religious
[32:07] but sometimes you need some
[32:10] religion you need to know how God
[32:12] operates and works amen this the these
[32:16] Jews were going up at the ninth hour of
[32:17] the
[32:19] day after the resurrection of the Lord
[32:21] Jesus after the baptism of the Holy
[32:23] Ghost they were going at the ninth hour
[32:25] of the day and here at the ninth hour of
[32:27] the day A man was going to receive a
[32:29] miracle he was going to be healed from
[32:31] paralysis from being crippled from it
[32:34] the time of his
[32:35] birth amen I want you to know it was at
[32:38] the n9th hour of the day that Elijah
[32:40] brought the evening
[32:42] sacrifice on Mount carel amen and the
[32:46] Lord descended upon that sacrifice with
[32:49] fire yes and it was at that time that
[32:52] the heart of the children of Israel was
[32:54] turned back to the faith of the fathers
[32:56] amen amen
[32:58] amen it was also the time that the
[33:00] Passover Lamb was slain and Jesus cried
[33:02] out on the cross you'll find this in
[33:04] Matthew
[33:05] 27:46 the Bible says about the 9th hour
[33:08] Jesus cried out why have you forsaken me
[33:11] so the sacrifice is on the cross at the
[33:13] 9th hour of the day and it was around
[33:15] the ninth hour of the day that Jesus
[33:17] died on the
[33:20] cross praise the
[33:25] Lord amen so 10: 3 and 4 you read there
[33:30] it was the 9th hour of the day that
[33:32] Cornelius starts to see a
[33:34] vision he sees the vision of an angel
[33:37] coming in and saying your prayers and
[33:39] your arms are come up before for a
[33:41] memorial before God what should he say
[33:43] your prayers and your arms I say we
[33:46] serve a god of Hebrews 138 who is the
[33:48] same yesterday today and forever and God
[33:50] still sees your prayers and your
[33:53] arms amen praise the Lord amen remember
[33:58] we are a church of faith and of Charity
[34:01] amen amen praise the Lord so we've got
[34:04] to be a church that is Manifest in the
[34:06] works of Christ as well that are amen a
[34:08] generous Church a giving Church a loving
[34:10] church and a faithful
[34:12] [Music]
[34:13] church amen it's so Cornelius you find
[34:16] sees a vision of the angel coming there
[34:18] and he says your praise and your arms
[34:20] are come for a memorial before God Amen
[34:24] and and in Acts 10: 30 and 31 it says 4
[34:27] days ago was fasting until this hour and
[34:29] at the ninth hour I prayed in my house
[34:31] and behold a man sat Before Me In Bright
[34:34] clothing and said Cornelius your prayer
[34:36] has been heard and your arms are
[34:38] remembered in the sight of God Amen I
[34:40] want to remind you of a quote I don't
[34:42] have it now but you'll know we've been
[34:43] through this many times brother Bram
[34:45] says when you have faith in the prayer
[34:47] line and even faith in a service he says
[34:49] maybe the next day the angel of God
[34:51] comes around the neighborhood seeing who
[34:53] is still in
[34:54] faith but what hour could it be I ask
[34:57] you yes
[34:58] amen
[35:00] amen because if you are thinking that we
[35:03] are so organized in our natural realm
[35:05] here I want you to know the Heavenly
[35:07] realm is more organized than us yes amen
[35:10] we derive all of our laws and strategies
[35:12] and everything based on a Heavenly
[35:14] pattern sometimes they don't even know
[35:16] it they call it the law of this the law
[35:17] of that the law of this but it is based
[35:19] God put that law
[35:21] there hallelujah amen amen so we are
[35:25] finding here that Peter and John are
[35:27] walking in amen faith and love are
[35:29] walking together and it is Faith working
[35:31] through love and it is love that
[35:33] produces the faith so this man is
[35:36] sitting at this gate called Beautiful
[35:38] amen but there is no Beauty in this man
[35:41] he is
[35:42] crle he's never walked a day in his
[35:46] life and he's begging there and when he
[35:48] saw Peter and John about to enter in he
[35:51] asked them for money the Bible says what
[35:54] are people asking you
[35:56] for maybe it's not only money they're
[35:58] asking you for maybe some are looking
[36:01] for some attention some are looking for
[36:03] love hey girls don't get me wrong now go
[36:05] give any uh you
[36:08] know Ru who comes to you and say he no
[36:11] he's looking for my attention and no I'm
[36:13] talking about a spiritual
[36:15] condition you Choose Wisely you choose a
[36:18] holy ghost filled Son of God Brothers
[36:21] you choose a holy ghost filled daughter
[36:23] of God Amen don't we say ah this poor
[36:27] girl she's like a jezebel but never mind
[36:29] the Bible says I must have
[36:32] love she's going to give you hell for
[36:34] your
[36:35] love amen praise the Lord now they come
[36:40] into the temple Court when he saw Peter
[36:42] I mean verse three there now amen Acts
[36:44] chapter 3 when he saw Peter and John
[36:46] about to enter he asked them for
[36:49] money Peter looked directly at him as
[36:54] did John so Peter and John Peter fasting
[36:57] his eyes upon Him W John said look on us
[37:02] yes amen now look on us doesn't mean
[37:06] that they must pay attention to the men
[37:09] what they are saying in the spiritual
[37:10] realm is look at us because this is how
[37:12] God is revealing himself at this time in
[37:19] season brother Bram says it another way
[37:21] the only Bible that people will read is
[37:24] you so if the only Bible they read is
[37:27] you where will the only love come
[37:29] from where will the only perfect Faith
[37:31] come from from the bride praise the Lord
[37:35] so look on
[37:36] us also showing that the veil had
[37:39] changed
[37:41] yes well look on us means have
[37:43] confidence in US yes when you go to pray
[37:46] for somebody if they don't have
[37:47] confidence in you nothing will happen to
[37:50] them now you know that generally when
[37:52] somebody is begging their eyes are down
[37:55] maybe because of humility or the feeling
[37:57] embarrassing
[37:58] so they this man is probably his head is
[38:00] down not looking at them and he's asking
[38:02] them for money and Peter tells him look
[38:05] on us amen Fix Your Eyes On
[38:09] Us Praise the
[38:11] Lord lucky they ped and say Lord take me
[38:14] out of the
[38:16] way that I won't be seen
[38:19] Lord you must know who Veil behind you
[38:23] you must know with what Authority you're
[38:24] walking within this hour amen you need
[38:27] to speak with authority
[38:30] too
[38:32] Hallelujah so Peter looks at him and he
[38:34] says look on Us Praise the
[38:38] Lord and he gave them heed so this man
[38:41] now faces his attention upon Peter and
[38:43] John remember it's faith and love
[38:48] Hallelujah and he gave e unto them
[38:50] expecting to receive something of them
[38:53] there's got to be an
[38:55] expectation amen even as I'm preaching
[38:57] to you this morning what's the
[38:59] expectation in your heart amen what do
[39:01] you want out of the service what is the
[39:04] desire of your
[39:05] heart amen praise the Lord amen what is
[39:09] the desire of your heart please don't be
[39:11] a person who has no expectation and no
[39:14] desire and no vision that's not a son
[39:16] and daughter of God Sons and Daughters
[39:18] of God are full of vision they are full
[39:20] of purpose amen they walking Purpose
[39:23] Driven
[39:24] lives praise the Lord if you go and read
[39:26] Genesis chap one there amen chapter 2
[39:29] verse one chapter 1 verse 2 God is
[39:31] looking at a dark World a void world
[39:35] Amen a world in
[39:39] chaos but God doesn't speak what he sees
[39:42] yes God speaks what he wants in the back
[39:45] part of his mind am yes amen over your
[39:48] situation don't speak what you see oh I
[39:51] don't have money oh I'm so poor oh I
[39:53] don't have this oh I'm so depressed I'm
[39:56] so don't speak what you see if you're a
[39:59] son and daughter of God you speak like
[40:01] how Abraham learned to speak like God he
[40:03] called those things which are not as
[40:05] though they are amen so speak amen what
[40:08] you want over your
[40:09] situation if you are in lack speak what
[40:12] you want let the weak say I am strong
[40:15] let the poor say I am rich let the blind
[40:18] say I can
[40:20] see
[40:22] amen and if you understand the law of
[40:24] God how it works when he's saying write
[40:26] the vision make it known upon
[40:29] tablets and you got to wait for
[40:32] it how if you know you can't s Idol you
[40:35] can't write here write the vision the
[40:38] Bible says write the vision how many if
[40:39] you know abook write the vision so you
[40:43] got a vision Lord I I my vision is this
[40:45] this this I'm writing it down you take
[40:47] that thing you fold it there put it
[40:48] under your pillow then you jump on the
[40:50] pillow and you
[40:52] sleep no who is God going to use to
[40:54] bring that to pass
[40:58] God is going to use you
[41:00] now so you can't be
[41:03] lazy a lazy man will grow die die
[41:08] poor because God can can't bless nothing
[41:12] but God can bless the fruits of your
[41:14] hands praise the Lord amen when God
[41:17] created Adam and this man was created in
[41:20] the image of God he had dominion over
[41:22] the fish of the sea over the fowls of
[41:24] the air over mountains the r he could
[41:26] speak to animal life God makes a garden
[41:29] and tell him walk in the
[41:33] garden so if you got your gri on time to
[41:36] kick the gri
[41:37] off time to get to work God put you on
[41:41] the earth to work and God will bless the
[41:44] fruits of your hands yes amen
[41:47] hallelujah we can't be lazy people there
[41:49] shouldn't be any lazy people in the
[41:51] kingdom of God amen amen we ought to
[41:53] drive out all
[41:55] laziness we ought to drive out amen
[41:57] anything that doesn't have a vision or a
[41:59] purpose hallelujah amen turn to your
[42:03] brother and sister tell them don't be
[42:05] lazy don't worry they won't get angry
[42:07] with you because you're repeating what
[42:08] I'm saying so tell them if you don't
[42:10] want to say that to them directly tell
[42:12] them the pastor say don't be
[42:13] lazy praise the
[42:18] Lord amen
[42:22] hallelujah so the man gives his
[42:25] attention to Faith and love I am telling
[42:28] you that something something somebody's
[42:31] expectation will be met here
[42:33] today yes now watch we had a testimony
[42:36] come back sister Victory sister Maggie
[42:39] finally gave the testimony of a clear
[42:42] test result of brother Duncan amen now
[42:45] let me tell you something that brother
[42:46] had AR
[42:47] attack sister Victor you had AR
[42:50] attack you had Art Attack From what the
[42:54] doctor
[42:55] said sister Ruth you had AR
[42:58] attack none of them have been for a
[43:00] stent an operation or anything because
[43:03] of
[43:05] [Applause]
[43:08] prayer remember when brother Duncan's
[43:10] testimony when brother Duncan's prayer
[43:12] request came through remember we having
[43:15] the all night prayer meeting and
[43:16] remember what I told you church I said
[43:18] he's not even a believer you don't go to
[43:20] church but I said because he did good to
[43:23] the bride he put on this Aon unit here I
[43:25] said we are praying on that basis
[43:27] because he did good to the
[43:29] bride thank you Lord so you read the
[43:33] message on the group he doesn't even
[43:34] need a stent no will he need a bypass
[43:37] and all his test results came back clear
[43:38] what is that the power of God working
[43:40] through faith and
[43:43] charity so this word is real yes that
[43:47] those who do good to the bride yeah yes
[43:50] who sends you forgiven they are forgiven
[43:52] amen that's scripture now if you don't
[43:53] want to believe scripture something's
[43:55] wrong with you who sins you remit they
[43:57] are remit amen and whose sin you retain
[44:00] they are retained I say unto you said
[44:02] Jesus amen that whatsoever you bind on
[44:04] Earth shall be bound in heaven how
[44:06] powerful are your words and whatsoever
[44:07] you loose or not shall be loosed in
[44:09] heaven
[44:11] amen amen so here is the same example
[44:15] now Peter and John is saying look on
[44:18] us now remember faith is not selfish no
[44:21] is love selfish Peter's not timeing to
[44:23] take the glory here because he
[44:25] understands where his faith is coming
[44:26] from amen
[44:27] it's coming from love who's accompanying
[44:30] him he says look on Us Praise the Lord
[44:34] look on both faith and charity amen
[44:37] don't look to faith alone you also need
[44:39] love accompanied with
[44:41] it maybe your situation has not
[44:44] responded to your faith I ask you to
[44:46] revisit your situation and bring the
[44:49] Divine Sovereign Love of Jesus upon
[44:52] it
[44:55] Hallelujah faith and love are looking
[44:57] look at this man but he was not looking
[44:58] at them so they need him to fix the eyes
[45:01] on this
[45:02] [Music]
[45:05] truth and I'm saying it again don't come
[45:08] here and tell me you got uh you got in
[45:10] this hour of the spoken word don't come
[45:12] tell me you got silent prayer request
[45:15] yes in fact the the word is unspoken we
[45:18] in the age of spoken word yeah you
[45:20] saying you're
[45:22] unspoken something is wrong you must
[45:25] speak the word amen Lord I don't want
[45:27] anyone else to know Lord and something's
[45:29] wrong with you because the Bible says
[45:31] confess your faults one to another in
[45:33] fact your lives ought to be open books
[45:35] before one another ah Lord nobody else
[45:37] must know this Lord please you come put
[45:40] one not here please ask the church to
[45:42] pray for me I got unspoken request now
[45:44] they don't know what to pray for these
[45:46] men are moving full of Faith open and
[45:48] charity here they don't know what to
[45:49] pray
[45:50] for Lord whatever they are saying Lord
[45:53] go and meet them at the point of need
[45:55] even God don't know what you because you
[46:00] spoken ask yes whatsoever Mark 11:23
[46:05] whatsoever things you
[46:07] say did it say pray to the mountain or
[46:10] say to the mountain say to the
[46:13] mountain praise the Lord you know they
[46:16] came to brother Bram and they spoke
[46:18] request oh the water in my tap is salty
[46:21] this is wrong even the you know so many
[46:25] things they came and spoke to the
[46:26] prophet
[46:27] and because they spoke the request God
[46:30] answered their faith amen so don't come
[46:32] here with silent prayer
[46:34] request Lord if you're truly God read my
[46:39] mind Hey no in the age of the spoken
[46:43] word spoken word is the Original Seed
[46:47] praise the Lord the Bible says call your
[46:50] brother you need to have somebody you
[46:51] can connect with tell them brother I'm
[46:53] going through this year you know I'm
[46:55] believing God I'm trusting God
[46:57] you know there's another quote you can
[46:58] probably find it uh if you read it
[47:01] carefully the prophet is saying that
[47:03] that a brother will come to you and say
[47:06] my crops are burning up there's been no
[47:10] rain and he say you'll say to him I'll
[47:14] send you rain how many if you read the
[47:16] quote he says there's a manifestation
[47:19] Romans 8 man praise the Lord there's a
[47:22] manifestation so you need to have
[47:24] confidence what I'm telling you here now
[47:26] you need to have confidence in your
[47:27] brother that they are carrying Faith
[47:29] open
[47:30] charity
[47:32] hallelujah amen a word spoken from the
[47:35] pulpit you receive it by faith you watch
[47:38] the manifestation follow it it could
[47:41] take one month two month 3 months 4
[47:42] month five month watch the manifestation
[47:45] that will follow it amen praise the Lord
[47:48] amen let's move quickly now
[47:50] amen so he Peter looking directly at him
[47:54] said look on us
[47:57] so the man amen fasten his eyes now it
[48:01] says here and he gave e unto them
[48:03] expecting to receive something of them
[48:06] then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I
[48:09] None but such as I have give I Thee in
[48:12] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[48:14] rise up and
[48:17] walk amen
[48:19] hallelujah Faith becomes a spokesperson
[48:22] yes Faith becomes a
[48:25] spokesperson because it is your faith
[48:27] that is seen and without faith it's
[48:28] impossible to please
[48:30] God hallelujah amen even now speak over
[48:35] your situation even now speak over your
[48:37] circumstance amen hallelujah what is he
[48:40] saying me as a man I don't have the
[48:42] physical capacity to meet you at the
[48:44] point of need but such as I have which
[48:46] is the Holy Ghost amen we the main thing
[48:49] that we have is the Holy Ghost and we
[48:51] don't go to it as our source we are
[48:54] relying on our human strength such as I
[48:56] have have Acts chapter 2 will show you
[48:58] what Came Upon them and what they had
[49:00] they had the Holy
[49:02] Ghost so what he's doing so amen love is
[49:07] producing grace and grace is producing
[49:10] the substance called Faith to meet the
[49:12] [Music]
[49:14] Hope amen praise the Lord maybe we'll
[49:17] just read one quote just now to show you
[49:18] what the prophet is saying there how it
[49:20] breaths amen when you have perfect love
[49:23] how it it it creates now Faith
[49:27] praise the
[49:28] Lord so the man now Watch What Happens
[49:30] here let's read quickly as we go I'm
[49:32] trying to read the Bible too because I
[49:33] know a lot of you don't read the Bible
[49:35] so we're getting your Bible reading time
[49:37] here amen and that's not now to go say
[49:40] the Pastor said uh you'll read the Bible
[49:42] for me every week no it's to make you
[49:44] feel
[49:47] ashamed amen praise the Lord let's
[49:53] read such as I have give I Thee in the
[49:56] name name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[49:58] rise up and walk I hope you're learning
[50:01] how to deal with your situation there's
[50:02] a name above every other name there's a
[50:05] name at which demons tremble the whole
[50:07] family in heaven is named after the name
[50:09] of Jesus and this this becomes a
[50:11] contention even now when they have a
[50:13] trial for Peter and John they want to
[50:14] know by what name did you speak because
[50:17] we know the name of a man can't make
[50:19] somebody
[50:20] walk praise the Lord amen
[50:27] and he took him by the right hand praise
[50:30] the Lord sometimes people need a little
[50:32] help he told him rise up and walk but
[50:35] maybe people won't move with you
[50:37] preaching to them maybe people won't
[50:39] move with you testifying to them they
[50:41] need a little push they need a little
[50:43] help amen because the man probably
[50:46] didn't move but Peter took him by the
[50:48] right hand amen amen did you hear what I
[50:51] said I said rise up and walk amen rise
[50:55] up and walk watch what the Bible said
[50:58] now amen he took him by the right hand
[51:01] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[51:04] and his ankle bones receive strength
[51:06] amen amen showing you that those things
[51:08] were dead you know when you don't use
[51:10] your muscles what happens amen you know
[51:12] even when you're laying on bed for a
[51:13] long time in hospital they've got to
[51:15] send you for therapy amen they got to
[51:17] make you start to walk again I want you
[51:19] to know this guy never walked for 40
[51:22] years and I want you to know even a baby
[51:25] must start to crawl before can walk so
[51:27] it takes time but God can bypass
[51:29] procedures God can bypass circumstances
[51:32] amen this man went from never walking to
[51:34] walking and not only walking he was
[51:37] leaping and jumping and praising God
[51:39] Amen yes Lord amen I tell you even some
[51:43] of you amongst you that never said an
[51:44] amen you can bypass protocols amen you
[51:47] can even skip saying an amen right now
[51:49] and start to jumping and praising God
[51:51] for his authority in you yes Lord thank
[51:54] you Jesus thank you Lord amen amen thank
[51:58] you Jesus maybe you're you're the back
[52:01] of a TR for your for even for your
[52:03] whatever you're Desiring maybe it's a
[52:05] promotion whatever you're doing God can
[52:07] bypass Protocols are you reading that in
[52:09] the
[52:10] Bible God bypass protocols maybe you're
[52:12] waiting for a contract maybe you're
[52:14] waiting for business whatever it is amen
[52:16] I tell you God will make you shine like
[52:18] the brightness of his glory and God will
[52:20] select you because you have Divine favor
[52:23] in this time and season you've got to
[52:24] believe who you are as a son and
[52:26] daughter of God if these two men Peter
[52:28] and John faith and charity had no
[52:30] confidence the Holy Ghost didn't give
[52:32] them confidence you think they could
[52:33] have gone up to this man and said look
[52:35] on us I'm saying the Holy Ghost in us
[52:38] which is producing faith hope and
[52:40] charity ought to give the bride a
[52:42] confidence and a boldness to
[52:44] speak stop being shy and saying oh come
[52:48] on faith is bold faith is
[52:51] [Music]
[52:52] ragged amen we need a church to be on
[52:55] the Move now amen we need a Church of
[52:57] the Living God can you imagine a shy
[53:00] Soldier don't see Let Me Hide I want to
[53:04] go behind the
[53:05] scenes you can't be in camouflage here

[53:15] when need Under The Chariot there I
[53:16] don't want anyone to see I'm
[53:21] speaking so you know humble you think
[53:25] when you meet the angel of God you know
[53:28] the anointing you are carrying amen you
[53:30] are bold in every circumstance amen you
[53:32] don't care who is listening to you you
[53:33] don't care if it's at work at school at
[53:36] home wherever it is you speak to your
[53:38] situation by faith amen I want you to
[53:41] know that without a without a Shadow of
[53:43] Doubt the angel of God is here with the
[53:46] church the angel of God never left the
[53:48] church the angel of God is here with the
[53:50] bride of Jesus Christ amen we've got to
[53:52] know that we are commissioned at this
[53:54] time amen thank you
[53:57] The Voice told John and John told took
[53:59] the book from the Angel and the angel
[54:01] said thou must prophesy again so the
[54:02] final voice is in your mouth amen the
[54:05] final Authority you carry oh yes amen
[54:08] but we can't be a silent group of people
[54:10] we've got to Proclaim boldness amen
[54:12] we've got to know we are the Church of
[54:13] the Living God
[54:15] Amen how many if you know Peter was
[54:17] faith we just said that right but if you
[54:19] go read the book of Peter faith is
[54:20] telling you please add to Faith amen add
[54:23] some charity add some virtue add some
[54:26] knowledge J some Temperance so when you
[54:28] are seeing faith and the Capstone
[54:30] charity you are seeing all of these
[54:32] virtues in you you're not just reading
[54:34] about Peter and John alone yeah you are
[54:36] seeing the complete Church the complete
[54:38] statue of a pyramid statue of a perfect
[54:41] man in action yeah yes yes amen we
[54:44] probably won't have time but maybe I
[54:45] should take the time because last week I
[54:47] gave you early
[54:48] leave last week you were saying so hot
[54:52] so I cut the server short amen praise
[54:55] the Lord
[54:57] amen I was telling brother Caleb hey I
[54:59] think I'm developing a bad appetite for
[55:01] the people because now I preach 1 hour
[55:04] and you go another service they preach 2
[55:05] hours you can't handle
[55:08] it amen so we got to create
[55:12] some
[55:15] appetite
[55:16] amen praise the Lord amen but I won't do
[55:19] that to
[55:20] you I'm just trying to make you pay
[55:22] attention because as soon as you say
[55:23] you're closing everyone is like yo past
[55:26] closing
[55:27] now amen praise the
[55:30] Lord so this man was leaping he leaping
[55:34] up stood walked and entered with them
[55:37] into the temple so when God heals you
[55:39] it's not for your own glory for you to
[55:40] run away are you reading you the Bible
[55:43] says he walked with them and he went
[55:45] into the temple to worship so don't come
[55:47] tell us to pray for one unbeliever will
[55:49] never come to church that's right if
[55:52] they are getting healed they must come
[55:53] to church amen are you reading what the
[55:55] Bible is saying entered with
[55:57] them tell them hey we prayed for you
[56:01] tell them we prayed for you that's why
[56:02] you got healed now you must come with us
[56:04] back to the temple and you must give
[56:06] praise to God amen Amen brother brand
[56:09] says you better watch your motive tell
[56:11] God why you want to be healed and he
[56:13] says tell God that you start to make
[56:15] promises to him Lord I promise you if
[56:17] you heal me Lord I will serve you I will
[56:19] never go back to those things of the
[56:20] world
[56:21] again how many of you have read
[56:24] them tell God what
[56:26] why make a promise to him and then
[56:29] fulfill the promise he goes back into
[56:32] the
[56:33] temple Hallelujah but now watch is the
[56:37] glory in the temple or is the glory now
[56:39] veil in these men that he's walking with
[56:41] so he's walking in the glory amen amen
[56:45] this man is walking in the glory praise
[56:47] the
[56:50] Lord you can read I'm if you promise to
[56:53] read Acts chapter 4 you go home and
[56:55] you'll read about Peter and John now
[56:57] taken to trial brother Jeffer probably
[56:59] like that because he's a lawyer praise
[57:02] the Lord and you'll go and see how they
[57:03] declare the name of Jesus how Peter and
[57:06] John amen they say they were unschooled
[57:08] ordinary men amen but they healed with
[57:12] the name of
[57:13] Jesus back to the power of the Holy
[57:15] Ghost amen and they command them to stop
[57:19] preaching but they say no should we
[57:20] listen to the voice of God or the voice
[57:22] of
[57:23] men
[57:25] Hallelujah here in verse 21 of Acts CH 4
[57:27] it says after further threats they let
[57:30] them go they could not find a way to
[57:32] punish them because all the people were
[57:34] glorifying God for what happened you see
[57:36] what's the purpose of God doing the
[57:38] miraculous in the church so that people
[57:40] can start to glorify his name people can
[57:43] start to worship him and give him glory
[57:44] and give him
[57:46] praise
[57:51] amen why are we walking in this
[57:53] anointing why is the bride equipped with
[57:55] this anointing
[57:56] if you read in the Book of Luke when
[57:59] Peter James and John are taken up into
[58:01] man Transfiguration
[58:04] there and the glory Cloud descends how
[58:07] many of you have read that The Cloud of
[58:09] Glory descends
[58:12] amen we read this chapter last week I'm
[58:15] closing now with this I got 3
[58:17] minutes amen you don't want to close
[58:21] she's saying don't close can you she's
[58:24] saying I don't want to close
[58:26] praise the
[58:29] lord we got the chapter brother last
[58:31] week's sermon let me give you Luke
[58:35] Chapter what was
[58:38] it when Peter James and John are taken
[58:40] up but I'll just say it now because I'm
[58:42] closing Peter James and John are taken
[58:44] up on Mount
[58:46] Transfiguration and the Bible says there
[58:49] when Peter James and John were taken
[58:52] up and The Cloud of Glory descended
[58:56] the Bible says they entered into the
[58:58] cloud amen how many of you have read
[59:01] that amen they entered into the cloud
[59:05] now I want you to know the cloud didn't
[59:07] just Veil Jesus like a garment so only
[59:12] here was the cloud like
[59:15] here right so because it's a Cloud of
[59:18] Glory 27 Mi high and 30 Mi wide what is
[59:22] this Cloud seven
[59:24] angels so it's a cloud that envelopes
[59:26] him yes right everybody paying attention
[59:32] amen so the Bible says they entered into
[59:35] the cloud
[59:37] amen you put up Revelation 101 there I'm
[59:40] driving a PO
[59:42] you Revelation 10:1 says what that the
[59:46] angel came down from heaven clothed with
[59:49] what so the cloud
[59:53] is covering the Earth
[59:56] and the bride enters the cloud thank you
[59:59] amen if Peter James and John had to
[1:00:02] enter the
[1:00:03] cloud at the adoption ceremony the bride
[1:00:06] in this hour must believe the cloud yes
[1:00:09] must enter the cloud amen for the
[1:00:12] adoption ceremony amen so what you are
[1:00:14] seeing here is the the glory of God they
[1:00:17] clothed with a cloud the angel is
[1:00:19] clothed with a cloud meaning it
[1:00:21] surrounds him it surrounds him and when
[1:00:24] the bride goes
[1:00:27] what I'm saying is the cloud didn't
[1:00:28] leave him when John goes to take the
[1:00:30] book amen everybody understanding this
[1:00:33] picture yeah the angel is clothed with a
[1:00:35] cloud he's surrounded with a cloud right
[1:00:39] John 10:10 I think it
[1:00:42] is 1010 sorry Revelation 10:10 just the
[1:00:47] next uh so when he's taking the book
[1:00:50] from the Angel's hand did he enter the
[1:00:51] cloud come on
[1:00:53] now if if he's clothed with this cloud
[1:00:56] when John is going to take the book if
[1:00:58] he comes within close distance of the
[1:01:00] angel will he enter into the
[1:01:03] cloud praise the Lord let's stand
[1:01:05] amen I want to show you what anointing
[1:01:08] we are operating
[1:01:10] under the bride has entered into the
[1:01:12] cloud thank you into the realm of seven
[1:01:15] angels that is why because night after
[1:01:18] night an angel came to the prophet to
[1:01:20] give that
[1:01:22] message so there Bride is a powerful
[1:01:25] Army but we've got got to know the keys
[1:01:26] how to operate so I say again if you've
[1:01:29] been operating love without faith you
[1:01:32] need love and faith if you've been
[1:01:34] operating faith without love you need
[1:01:36] love now there are different types of
[1:01:39] love there's filio love there's agape
[1:01:43] love and there's OS love the love we are
[1:01:47] talking about is the agape
[1:01:50] love it's a love that transcends the
[1:01:52] human
[1:01:53] love amen praise the Lord
[1:01:56] Lord glory be to his
[1:01:59] name as I close
[1:02:02] now I want you to know you can't keep
[1:02:06] faith in
[1:02:07] prison amen you can't keep faith in
[1:02:12] prison praise the
[1:02:14] Lord when they imprisoned Peter what
[1:02:16] happened even the angel descended to
[1:02:19] release Faith from prison amen did the
[1:02:22] angel descend to release Peter you
[1:02:24] remember Peter walked up to the
[1:02:26] disciples and he knocked on the door the
[1:02:28] girl opens the door and she thought
[1:02:29] she's seeing a ghost why you can't
[1:02:32] arrest faith God won't allow your faith
[1:02:35] to be arrested amen amen amen God will
[1:02:38] even descend from heaven with an angel
[1:02:40] and release Faith amen so if Satan has
[1:02:43] crippled your faith arrested your faith

[1:02:53] prison

[1:02:58] faith and love you can't kill love they
[1:03:03] couldn't kill John no matter how much
[1:03:06] they tried to kill him they put him in a
[1:03:08] pot of oil and they tried to burn
[1:03:12] him this man was
[1:03:14] Unstoppable he was unshakable he was
[1:03:18] immovable
[1:03:20] love they couldn't kill
[1:03:23] John amen why
[1:03:26] John is the one who go in the Rapture
[1:03:29] yes so you can't kill John because she
[1:03:31] must she must go in the
[1:03:33] Rapture that's why in type John couldn't
[1:03:36] be killed John must take the book he's
[1:03:38] right there at the end of the Gentile
[1:03:40] dispensation because Revelation 11
[1:03:43] starts with Moses and Elijah coming to
[1:03:45] the Jews yes so at the end there now of
[1:03:48] Revelation 10 you must know it's the end
[1:03:50] of the Gentile dispensation the final
[1:03:52] prophecy is on the earth and John is

[1:04:06] Rapture yes but what's needed for the
[1:04:09] Rapture perfect
[1:04:12] Faith so can you see how we are
[1:04:14] positioned John is there he's typing
[1:04:17] love but where is love how is love how
[1:04:20] is Faith going to be produced love will
