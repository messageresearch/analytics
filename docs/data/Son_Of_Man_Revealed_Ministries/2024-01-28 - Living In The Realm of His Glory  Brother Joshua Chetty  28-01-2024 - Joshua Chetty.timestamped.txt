[8:26] you all
[8:27] precious thank you Jesus
[8:29] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[8:32] amen you know the prophet
[8:34] says he said weever two or three Jesus
[8:37] said wherever two or three are gathered
[8:38] in my name yes Lord I'll be in their
[8:41] midst amen amen he said and that makes
[8:43] him in a world that we cannot see that
[8:47] our five senses doesn't contact Jesus
[8:50] Christ is here present if you could be
[8:54] conscious of thaten and he said and and
[8:57] remember not only yet yeah but when
[9:00] you're walking down the
[9:02] street wherever you are you that profess
[9:06] to be Believers and fear the lord
[9:08] remember the angels of God are moving
[9:10] with you wherever you are oh thank you
[9:13] Lord they watch everything you do yes
[9:15] every thought that goes through your
[9:17] mind and they know all about you amen
[9:22] therefore we must be conscious of that
[9:24] amen he said if you're not conscious of
[9:26] it then you act anyway yes so people
[9:30] mostly today too many people are not
[9:33] conscious of the presence of the Lord
[9:34] Jesus that's the reason we have these
[9:37] things that we have going on now that's
[9:39] not right yes if he could only do like
[9:43] David said yes I put the lord always
[9:46] before me amen amen oh I like that the
[9:50] Lord is always before me where he goes
[9:53] i' follow and I'm and I'm conscious that
[9:56] everywhere I'm going other words David
[9:58] said that the Lord is going before me
[10:02] amen what Jesus said I will not leave
[10:05] thee nor forsake Thee thank you Lord
[10:07] said Jesus lo I Am With You Always even
[10:10] to the end of the world he cannot leave
[10:13] us he promised than not to amen what a
[10:16] promise hallelujah amen what an
[10:18] assurance we have as Believers amen we
[10:22] have this Blessed assurance that every
[10:24] way he goes the Lord goes before us the
[10:27] angels are set before us yes he said he
[10:30] will never leave us nor forsake us you
[10:32] might be going to that trial you might
[10:34] be going to that disastrous time you
[10:36] might be going to that cality and you're
[10:38] wondering that you're thinking that you
[10:39] are alone but you are not alone he said
[10:41] he will never leave you nor forsake you
[10:44] amen he knows everything that you go
[10:46] through he knows every circumstance you
[10:48] face amen amen oh wonderful thank you
[10:51] Lord amen you got your Bibles we'll turn
[10:53] to the book of Isaiah 55:6 amen I greet
[10:57] you all in the precious name of our our
[10:59] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen
[11:02] we all glad to be found in his presence
[11:04] this morning amen there's no other place
[11:07] that we rather be but in his presence
[11:10] amen so let's turn to the book of Isaiah
[11:13] chapter 55 reading from verse
[11:19] 6 amen you happy with what the Lord is
[11:21] doing so far amen amen amen the way is
[11:25] taking us
[11:26] from from Glory unto Glory amen amen and
[11:31] is showing us his
[11:34] plan he's unfolding his plan as it goes
[11:37] by and we are part of and he's showing
[11:39] us that we are part of the plan and we
[11:41] playing out our part in his plan
[11:42] absolutely amen so as you can see the
[11:45] gospel has become more practical yes in
[11:47] recent times it's become more putting it
[11:50] to you and showing you all now it's in
[11:53] operation right now amen we add it in
[11:55] theory all the time but now under the
[11:58] dynamic amen become a practical gospel
[12:02] that's what you've been listening to
[12:03] week after week the gospel has become
[12:05] more practical amen amen so you're not
[12:07] just becoming heers
[12:09] anymore you're becoming doers
[12:12] of Lord amen and you're not reading the
[12:15] testimony you are becoming the tesy
[12:17] hallelujah
[12:19] amen so Isaiah 556 say Seek the Lord
[12:24] while he may be found yes
[12:27] amen call ye upon while he is near
[12:31] amen amen because he coming an
[12:33] hour amen we may not even be able to be
[12:36] gathered here yes there's becoming a
[12:40] time while you might not be preached
[12:42] this gospel am everything that's being
[12:45] preaches now yes is being imparted into
[12:48] you yes and you are digesting it and
[12:52] becoming one with that word amen amen
[12:54] but there coming a time where you won't
[12:56] be able to see this Gathering he said
[12:59] let the wicked forsake his ways and the
[13:01] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[13:04] return unto the Lord yes Lord amen so
[13:07] he's saying we must forsake our own
[13:10] ways forsake our own thoughts amen

[13:16] Lord and He will have mercy upon him and
[13:19] to our God he will abundantly a pardon

[13:25] much down you went in the pits he will
[13:29] abundantly pardon you pardon you amen
[13:31] amen for my thoughts are not your
[13:34] thoughts yes neither are your ways my
[13:38] ways say the Lord for as the heavens are
[13:42] higher than the Earth's so are my ways
[13:46] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[13:50] than your thoughts amen for as the rain
[13:53] cometh
[13:55] down and the snow from heaven and return

[15:20] looked and behold a door was opened in
[15:23] heaven and the first voice which I heard
[15:26] was as it were of a trumpet talking with
[15:29] me which said come up hither and I will

[15:53] this is the hour yes where we are living
[15:55] in the realm of his glory glory amen
[15:59] maybe we lived in the realm of our own
[16:02] thoughts we've been living in the realm
[16:04] of our caral thinking we've been living
[16:07] too much in this Earthly realm amen but
[16:11] now that the mind of Christ come down
[16:14] yes maybe God could have wied you in
[16:17] other ages but in the age of adoption
[16:20] when the mind of when The Headstone has
[16:22] come down amen and the body fly framed
[16:26] together from the four corners of the
[16:28] Earth from every nation tribe tongue and
[16:31] Kindred amen that his body is brought

[16:46] framed together he coming together and
[16:49] the mind of Christ come down to her yes
[16:52] amen she's now forsaking her own
[16:55] thoughts amen this body is now forsaking
[16:58] own thinking yes this body might have
[17:00] looked at things to time but when God
[17:03] looks at us he looks at us through
[17:05] eternity amen amen he doesn't look at us
[17:07] just in the time element that we're
[17:09] living in now amen he looked at you
[17:11] completely through all eternity he
[17:13] doesn't only look at you going now
[17:15] getting ready for the Rapture he looks
[17:16] at you living in the ions of time amen
[17:20] from all eternity all the way that you
[17:22] come from his mind amen and the fact
[17:24] that we come from him we an attribute of
[17:27] him yes amen amen and therefore when we
[17:31] when you get this now you are now able
[17:34] to come and live in the realm of his
[17:36] glory amen because God will show share
[17:38] his glory with no man yes amen remember
[17:42] this one thing God will share his glory
[17:44] with no man yes amen for God to share
[17:47] his glory it means that you part of him
[17:49] you an attribute of God you are not
[17:52] separated from God you are the part of
[17:54] God the feminist part of God you are not
[17:57] sep you understand you are one with
[18:00] him that's why he said I share my glory
[18:02] with no man you're not just a normal
[18:04] person you are an attribute of
[18:08] God therefore now you can live in the
[18:11] realm of his glory
[18:18] amen John 17:9 it says I pray for them I
[18:23] pray not for the world but for them
[18:27] which thou has given me
[18:29] for they are dine and all mine are dine
[18:33] and dine are mine and I am glorified in
[18:35] them yes amen amen and now I am no more
[18:41] in the
[18:42] world but these are in the
[18:46] world see here to go up higher
[18:50] amen and I come to thee Holy Father keep
[18:54] through thine own name Those whom thou
[18:57] has given me that they may be one amen
[19:01] as we are yes now for us to live in his
[19:04] glory we have to come up a bit higher
[19:06] amen amen that's why John was called up
[19:09] to come up higher yes he said John you
[19:11] are past all these ages Church ages now
[19:13] now it's time for you to come up higher
[19:15] amen if you if you want to experience
[19:17] for us to now have the same glor to
[19:20] experience the glory of God this the the
[19:24] way that go God worked when he was on
[19:26] Earth we have to come up higher amen we
[19:28] cannot live in the realm of this world
[19:30] am because when Jesus was on this Earth
[19:33] he walked in perfect Faith because he
[19:35] knew who he was he knew what the
[19:37] scripture said about him he knew what
[19:39] the word said about him he knew who he
[19:40] is in the word and he could walk in
[19:43] perfect Faith because he didn't live in
[19:45] the realm
[19:47] of of the world you understand he was in
[19:49] the world but he was not of the world
[19:52] just like how we are in this world we
[19:53] are not of this world amen
[19:57] amen
[19:59] so in this age in the age of adoption in
[20:01] the mind of Christ come God wants us to
[20:04] think on his level yes far too long
[20:07] we've been looking at things in our with
[20:10] our own
[20:11] wisdom our own wisdom will fail us yes
[20:14] amen our wisdom is limited amen that's
[20:18] why you find the most intelligent
[20:20] theologians of the world they study the
[20:23] scriptures spend hours studying the
[20:26] scriptures yes but they can never never
[20:28] understand the things that you and I can
[20:30] see yes why they can't see
[20:33] this because they kind have fellowship
[20:36] with God you to for you to have
[20:39] fellowship with God you must come to his
[20:40] level amen amen yes amen if you want to
[20:44] go and have fellowship with learned
[20:47] people you can't be th an illiterate
[20:49] person sitting amongst learned people
[20:52] trying to have fellowship with them you
[20:53] don't enjoy the company because you're
[20:55] going to talk about things maybe use
[20:57] Grand and things that you might not
[20:59] understand it if you want to speak to a
[21:01] talented person maybe a talented
[21:03] musician he can't have fellowship with
[21:05] you if you're not a talented musician
[21:07] with him while he's talking about music
[21:09] and playing his music now you're trying
[21:10] to have Fellowship around his music how
[21:13] can you have fellowship if you're not
[21:14] one with him yes so how can you have
[21:17] fellowship with God if you are not one
[21:19] with God
[21:22] Amen that's why Jesus prayed this prayer
[21:25] Jesus wanted a Oneness that become one
[21:28] with him and the only way you can become
[21:31] one with him you have to realize that
[21:33] you always wear
[21:35] powery amuah amen but by sin you were
[21:39] separated from him but within you amen
[21:43] that part the Gen of God was always
[21:45] within you that part was always there he
[21:47] just needed that light to bring it forth
[21:49] to life amen he just needed the seven
[21:51] ters to come and awaken you out of that
[21:54] spiritual Amnesia that you was under you
[21:56] thought you was under this world system
[21:58] you thought you were under some church
[22:00] system but the word came to awaken you
[22:03] amen amen because God didn't want you an
[22:05] ordinary citizen he wanted you as part
[22:07] of his body to continue the work amen
[22:10] and he say now come up a little higher
[22:12] amen you are called to greater things
[22:14] you are living in the astronaut age amen
[22:17] you are not living in a thing in a time
[22:19] where people live in awesome buggy age
[22:21] you're not living the time in aerplane
[22:22] age in a motor car age you are living
[22:25] the time to come up higher fire the
[22:28] things
[22:29] amen yes Lord amen thank you Lord and
[22:33] God said I will share my glory with no
[22:35] man oh thank you Lord but only to those
[22:39] that are part of him yes amen those that
[22:41] belong that's why the the book nobody
[22:43] could even was worthy to even look upon

[24:10] Dimensions amen amen and when you are
[24:13] walking with God though you are living
[24:15] on the earth you are seated here now in
[24:17] Heavenly places you are not looking at
[24:19] things to to your own mind now you are
[24:21] looking this at things to the eyes of
[24:23] God's word amen you are seeing things
[24:26] far beyond
[24:28] you know there was a man one
[24:31] time he was an in
[24:35] Inventor and he invented a certain
[24:38] device and he and he and he and he
[24:41] invented his device before should I say
[24:44] ahead of his
[24:46] time and he got married and when he was
[24:50] trying to invent this device he needed
[24:52] money he borrowed money and things were
[24:54] financially
[24:55] hard and then the family started
[24:58] fighting with him his wife started
[25:00] wondering why he spending so much
[25:01] investing so much time to invent this
[25:04] she couldn't see the
[25:06] vision she couldn't see the bigger
[25:08] picture and then he eventually he had to
[25:11] borrow money from his
[25:13] in-laws for his invention and then when
[25:16] he didn't come through
[25:18] immediately he had the in-laws got upset
[25:20] with him and it became a family
[25:23] war and then eventually as time went on
[25:26] his wife even left him
[25:30] But as time went on when it came to that
[25:33] right time to meet the right when when
[25:35] his invention was now to take off when
[25:37] it came at the right time people would
[25:39] with the with the same mind with the
[25:41] mind frame like him could see why they
[25:43] needed this
[25:46] invention he became a a very rich man a
[25:50] very successful
[25:53] man but at the time when he was making
[25:56] this invention nobody could could see it
[25:58] yes no because he did it Beyond his time
[26:01] ahead of his time and nobody could see
[26:04] what was the end
[26:06] product and when God looked you and at
[26:09] you and I oh yes nobody else could see
[26:12] the end product but he himself oh thank
[26:14] you Lord the master designer amen the
[26:17] master
[26:18] architect because he making that
[26:21] Masterpiece oh yes nobody could see it
[26:23] through the seven as it was coming to to
[26:25] each Church age and everyone was
[26:27] thinking this church is falling apart in
[26:29] each age then he sends a messenger on H
[26:32] age to catch the
[26:34] people amen amen and then it was still
[26:37] building up and then he must have
[26:38] thought Satan must have thought he won
[26:41] it at the Dark Ages when everything
[26:44] completely darkened out but then came
[26:47] Luda and said that just shall live by
[26:49] faith am some light began to strike amen
[26:53] and then came the me Agee and where they
[26:55] came along with the message of
[26:56] sanctification
[26:58] yes amen because now you must be
[27:00] Sanctified and set apart for service
[27:03] amen then while they were set service
[27:06] they still needed to see some power of
[27:07] God they needed some spark there amen
[27:10] amen and then came the Pentecostal age
[27:12] and the gift came down amen showing
[27:15] these are the first fruits amen these
[27:17] are some gifts these are showing you now
[27:20] that these that God is with this
[27:23] people and God is still in the business
[27:26] but you had it took a prophet now to
[27:28] come and go in the back part of God's
[27:30] mind to see this entire plan this entire
[27:34] Plan of Redemption that God had this
[27:37] perfect invention amen yes that he was
[27:40] going to produce himself in human flesh
[27:43] in a many membered body he was going to
[27:47] reproduce himself again amen he's not

[27:58] has his mind she know what he wants done

[28:05] amen but that is why we need to pray for
[28:08] Revelation amen must desire to have more
[28:11] revelation of God's word because why his
[28:14] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[28:15] amen his ways are higher than our ways

[28:42] meet with your needs he'll never give
[28:44] you more than you can enjoy and
[28:47] sometimes you go to suffering because
[28:48] suffering is working patience he's
[28:50] testing your faith every son and

[29:26] struggling to surrender
[29:27] yes amen you can't be years and years in
[29:30] the message and say I'm here for so long
[29:32] and struggling to surrender to
[29:35] him surrender means to stop resisting to
[29:38] an opponent and submit to their
[29:41] Authority Lord
[29:44] amen so we must stop resisting God's
[29:47] word yes amen stop resisting God and
[29:50] surrender to his authority you might be
[29:52] say Lord I still need to sort these
[29:54] things out in my life I still have these
[29:56] issues that's the problem you are trying
[29:59] to do it amen that is not
[30:01] surrendering when you surrendering say
[30:03] Lord I completely leave everything to
[30:07] your feet right now I lay myself I yeld
[30:10] myself unto you Lord come and take
[30:13] control that's what he wants he wants
[30:16] you to come and live in the realm of his
[30:18] glory yes amen and if you surrender
[30:21] yourself to him he puts his spirit in
[30:23] you and his Spirit leads you guides you

[30:36] do that you are being influenced from
[30:37] beneath amen you're still struggling
[30:39] because you are influenced from another
[30:41] a fth dimension when we should be
[30:44] influenced from above
[30:48] amen remember we are vessels of honor to
[30:51] God am that's what we are we are in
[30:54] vessels amen God look looks at us not
[30:58] the way we look at ourselves he looks at
[31:01] us already
[31:06] perfect the book of 2 Corinthians 3:
[31:09] 7-18 says but if the ministration of
[31:14] death written and engraven in Stones was
[31:18] glorious so that the children of Israel
[31:21] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[31:24] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[31:28] which Glory was to be done
[31:31] away how shall not the ministration of
[31:34] the spirit be rather glorious yes for if
[31:39] the ministration of condemnation be
[31:42] glory much more do the ministration of
[31:45] righteousness exceed in glory yes amen
[31:49] for even that which was made glorious
[31:51] and no glory in this
[31:53] Respect by reason of the glory that
[31:56] excelled for for if that which is done
[31:59] away was
[32:00] glorious so that was glorious right yes
[32:03] much more that which remain it amen is
[32:07] glorious seeing then that we have such
[32:10] hope we use great Pless of speech and
[32:14] not as Moses which put a veil over his
[32:17] face not that the children of Israel
[32:19] could not
[32:20] steadfastly sorry that the children of
[32:23] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[32:26] end of of that which is abolished but
[32:30] their minds were blinded for until this
[32:33] day remained the same Veil untaken away
[32:36] in the reading of the whole Testament
[32:38] that Veil is done away in Christ amen
[32:41] but even unto this day when Moses is
[32:44] read the veil is upon their
[32:48] hearts
[32:50] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[32:52] Lord the veil shall be taken
[32:56] away now the Lord is that spirit and
[33:00] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[33:05] Liberty
[33:07] amen but we all with open face beholding
[33:11] as in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[33:13] changed into the same image from glory
[33:17] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[33:21] Lord amen so where the spirit of the
[33:24] Lord is there is Liberty amen there is
[33:26] freedom you know no longer in bondage
[33:28] amen yes amen that is why sometimes some
[33:32] people still have the
[33:34] Veil Just like how natural Israel even
[33:37] spiritually some people still have the
[33:39] veil because they're looking at it to a
[33:41] day gone by they look at it to the day
[33:44] of this is the day God did this in the
[33:46] time of the Prophet but God is doing it
[33:49] now God is working amongst us now amen
[33:52] he is here amongst us in the present
[33:57] because there is he preserved us for
[33:59] this hour because there is a people that
[34:01] got to do a work on the earth amen we
[34:04] are living in a time where man is going
[34:07] to is crying out for a savior man needs
[34:10] something to look to amen and they have
[34:13] no hope the only blessed hope and
[34:16] Assurance they can get it from is from
[34:18] you and
[34:20] I we are the instruments that God has
[34:24] chosen to use in this hour amen
[34:27] we are the vessels now you can choose to
[34:30] be a vessel Of Dishonor or a vessel of
[34:33] Honor now if you want to be used by God
[34:36] you have to be a vessel of honor and for
[34:38] you to be a vessel of Honor you have to
[34:40] surrender yourself completely unto him
[34:43] and for you to surrender yourself andto
[34:45] him you must die to self one of the
[34:48] greatest enemy that we have right now
[34:50] for God not to use us in his fullness is
[34:52] ourselves yes because our selfish nature
[34:56] is still thinking about temporary things
[34:59] yes our selfish nature want to satisfy
[35:03] things that we have need of in this
[35:05] temporal life in this life whereby maybe
[35:08] you live under 60 in good 17 good and
[35:11] after you down
[35:12] your such a temporal
[35:15] life such a temporal life we don't want
[35:18] to surrender to God when he can use us
[35:21] in his fullness God wants to do so much
[35:23] more amongst us because he said I will
[35:26] present my myself a glorious church he
[35:30] not asking you to think on your own
[35:31] thoughts he said my thoughts are higher
[35:34] than your thoughts he wants you to have
[35:37] his mind
[35:38] amen he wants you to have his thoughts
[35:42] he wants you to have fellowship with him
[35:44] in the way he thinks amen he want you to
[35:46] come up higher to his level but far too
[35:49] long we are kept down on Earthly things
[35:52] because that's what Satan does he wants
[35:53] to keep us in bondage he wants to keep
[35:55] us as slaves slaves in our work slaves
[35:59] to the things of this life slaves to the
[36:01] cares of everything that around us amen
[36:04] all our Earthly Pleasures all our
[36:07] Earthly family who spends too much of
[36:09] time with us all our our work life our
[36:12] bosses they want to keep us in bondage
[36:15] but that is what Satan is doing we need
[36:17] to go up higher amen
[36:19] amen you are just those Earthly things
[36:21] that we do are just to get by in this
[36:23] life that is not our purpose God put us
[36:27] here for a special purpose amen and his
[36:30] purpose stands amen God purpose stands
[36:33] amen amen we go to work we do we do the
[36:37] things we do is to get by in this life
[36:40] but it's not the main purpose that's
[36:43] what you need to understand we need to
[36:44] get delivered from that mindset that
[36:46] every day when we wake up we are living
[36:48] for God's purpose amen not wake up I'm
[36:50] going I'm waking up because I have to go
[36:52] to work I'm waking up because I have to
[36:54] go to school I'm waking up because I
[36:56] have to to do this and do that I am
[36:58] waking up because I'm here to fulfill
[37:01] God's purpose and wherever he put me I
[37:04] am fulfilling his purpose Hallelujah if

[37:08] his purpose if he put me in the

[37:31] understand that we are here to carry out
[37:34] the business of our father's Kingdom

[44:48] outside of Jesus Christ there is no
[44:50] eternal life right amen
[44:54] yes
[44:56] that's
[44:58] right so it's easy for us to lose sight
[45:01] of the glory that God is surrounding us
[45:04] with yes it's easy you you you walk
[45:06] tomorrow to work you go and you're not
[45:09] full of the Holy Ghost I'm telling you
[45:12] it's easy
[45:14] yeah but God is keep reminding us of
[45:17] this thing through his word amen that's
[45:19] why he got the preaching of the Gospel
[45:20] to keep hammering to to remind us amen
[45:23] God got the fivefold ministry for
[45:25] perfecting us it's for our good amen
[45:27] amen God don't bring the 54 Ministry to
[45:30] take you out of the Bride it brings it
[45:32] to place you in your place positionally
[45:34] place you
[45:37] amen the glory of God is Not Just An
[45:41] mere attribute that you think it his
[45:43] divine nature yes amen and that's why
[45:46] Peter said we are partakers of his
[45:49] divine nature it's about his Holiness
[45:53] yes it's about his majesty his Splendor
[45:57] amen amen all of this Encompass around
[46:00] it yes and that is
[46:03] why before esta could come into the
[46:05] Royal
[46:06] Palace and when the King was having this
[46:09] feast and he called
[46:12] vashi he wanted her to be part he wanted
[46:14] her to come
[46:15] amongst his associates to show the
[46:18] Splendor that he had he wanted her to be
[46:20] part of the
[46:21] splendor but she was self she was
[46:24] worried about herself
[46:27] she was focused on
[46:30] herself she was focused on smaller
[46:33] things she couldn't think higher
[46:34] thoughts like the king cuz the King was
[46:36] going to show her the Splendor and he
[46:38] wanted somebody he can offer off his
[46:39] kingdom to he wanted someone to have to
[46:42] rule with him amen who was foot to rule
[46:45] but she wasn't foot to rule because she
[46:47] was all about
[46:49] herself so we going to be worried about
[46:51] ourself ourself ourself how are we going
[46:54] to be foot to rule because the Bible
[46:56] says we going to judge the Earth the
[46:59] Saints shall judge the
[47:00] Earth amen we going to rule and reign
[47:03] with him amen and for us to rule and
[47:06] reign with him we got to be part of his
[47:07] Splendor we got to be part of his
[47:09] majesty that's why Esther now when she
[47:13] could put on a royal Apparel in the time
[47:16] of remember it wasn't a time when the
[47:20] king
[47:21] called go but Esther wasn't
[47:24] called amen but it was a desperate hour
[47:29] it was a desperate
[47:30] time but when but the way she approach
[47:34] the
[47:35] king he could see this is a person
[47:38] that's foot to rule with me this is a
[47:40] person that I can share my glory with
[47:43] amen amen that's why he could offer a
[47:45] half of his kingdom because why she knew
[47:50] when she put on the Royal p she could
[47:52] see now what she was put there for amen
[47:55] she you could see the main purpose of
[47:57] what she was put in the Kingdom
[47:59] for and now the Bible say those that are
[48:01] full with the Holy Ghost are crying and
[48:04] sign for the abomination of the Lost
[48:06] amen what are you putting the to for yes
[48:09] you can't be seeing people that are
[48:10] going to hell and be normal with it yes
[48:13] you can't be looking at man in such a
[48:15] sinful condition and feel normal about
[48:17] it amen then you're not thinking like
[48:20] your father yes that's why he said come
[48:23] up higher you need to see the full
[48:25] teacher John there's people that are
[48:27] going to be lost here
[48:29] John there's people that are going to go
[48:31] through the
[48:33] tribulation there's people are are not
[48:35] going to see Heaven there's people are
[48:36] going to go to hell
[48:38] amen right now there's people that you
[48:41] can be preaching and preaching to and
[48:43] they won't get it because they don't
[48:45] want to surrender to him because why
[48:48] their conscious is already in
[48:50] h that's right you're going to go out
[48:53] there in this hour of the Third po you
[48:56] can be preaching the gospel and the
[48:58] people won't listen to you but your job
[49:00] is to preach the gospel amen one day one
[49:02] day God is a righteous judge and when
[49:05] he's judging them one day he's going to
[49:06] be playing in a big
[49:09] screen and how you was talk presenting
[49:11] the gospel to them how you presented
[49:13] Christ to them and how they rejected it
[49:17] yes Psalms 191 says the heavens declare
[49:21] the glory of God yes the skies above
[49:24] Proclaim his handy works
[49:26] creation itself testifies to the glory
[49:29] of our creator amen from the vastness of
[49:32] the cosmos yes to the intricacies of a
[49:35] single cell God's glory is displayed for
[49:39] all to see amen
[49:42] hallelujah
[49:52] amen Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3:18 but
[49:55] we all with open face beholding as in a
[49:58] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[50:00] into the same image amen from Glory unto
[50:04] Glory from glory to glory even as by the
[50:08] spirit of the Lord amen that is
[50:10] transforming power in US yes
[50:14] amen be not conformed to the pth of this
[50:17] world but be transformed by the renewing
[50:19] of your mind Romans 12:2 the why it says
[50:22] that is
[50:23] because at one time you have your mind
[50:26] is thinking on this five sense is in
[50:28] line to your five senses only and you're
[50:31] thinking as on the things that you see
[50:32] with your natural eyes and the things
[50:35] that you hear with your ears naturally
[50:37] all your senses right the things that
[50:39] you feel the things that you touch the
[50:40] things that you smell but now you're
[50:43] thinking when the six yet com in faith
[50:45] come by faith you accept Jesus Christ
[50:49] and now you accept this word the mind of
[50:50] Christ comes down yes so you are
[50:52] thinking now that mind that mind of of
[50:55] Christ now you are being transformed now
[50:57] into the image because you are seeing
[50:59] his image amen amen you're seeing it
[51:01] through the word the adulterated word
[51:04] the word can't change for no man yes
[51:08] amen this very gospel that we receive is
[51:10] an unadulterated word amen we can't
[51:13] change it amen we can't add to it we
[51:15] cannot take out from it amen it is a
[51:18] perfect word hallelujah because if God
[51:20] had to change his word it mean he wasn't
[51:22] perfect he wasn't all knowing god he
[51:25] knew things or as it God knows things
[51:30] like our mind can't fathom it because we
[51:32] got a finite mind he's got an infinite
[51:34] mind in knew the beginning to the end he
[51:37] know all things amen and that's why his
[51:40] word is so perfect and now man wants to
[51:43] come and reason with God's word and tell
[51:46] you know it means this and it should
[51:48] evolve with time God word doesn't evolve
[51:51] with time amen the only thing that will
[51:52] evolve with you is your revelation of
[51:54] the word amen the only thing that
[51:56] evolves is that you seek it more clearly
[51:58] now because the more you come into His
[52:00] Image it's becoming more plain to you
[52:02] it's become that's why I said now the
[52:04] gospel is practical because now you can
[52:06] take it you can apply it
[52:09] yes amen you'll hear the testimony the
[52:12] other
[52:15] day but the dear
[52:19] sister amen you take the gospel that we
[52:22] receiving prayer of faith went forth and
[52:24] the Mir was done amen because why you
[52:27] took the word you believed as Believers
[52:29] you can stand in the Gap amen you had
[52:32] Faith to believe that you have to
[52:34] believe God's word you have to believe
[52:36] that he's a Healer and you can believe
[52:38] that he's still healing today if you
[52:40] don't believe he heals today if you if
[52:41] you got doubt in that word then you
[52:43] can't apply it that's right if you if
[52:45] you have doubt that he's a mirical
[52:46] working God then you can't say he's a
[52:48] god of mirical and ask for a
[52:50] medical amen you trusting God for need
[52:53] you don't believe is Jehovah J you're
[52:54] provided to today amen then how are you
[52:57] going to ask him to meet with your needs
[52:59] yeah how are you going to ask him to
[53:00] provide for your needs if you can't see
[53:02] him as a Healer today then how are you
[53:04] going to ask for healing amen you got to
[53:07] see him in the now
[53:10] amen oh no but it's just my brother and
[53:13] sister praying no then you are looking
[53:15] at it carnally that's not your brother
[53:17] that's a son and daughter of God when
[53:19] you see them you seeing Jesus Christ
[53:24] amen
[53:26] that is why many of you know the
[53:27] testimony when I was when the Lord
[53:29] healed me day while we having a family
[53:31] Al call that day when my wife was
[53:33] approaching me I didn't see her I knew
[53:36] there was something different about the
[53:37] continence and I sense that the angel of
[53:39] God was there amen within me I sin that
[53:42] this is not ordinary amen and I
[53:45] surrendered myself to it I raised my
[53:47] hands up and I received my healing to
[53:49] this day not a single pain you can't
[53:52] even touch and feel anything thank you
[53:53] Lord completely healed
[53:56] [Music]
[53:57] ameny Lord so I know but the god that
[54:01] can heal yes that's why I said this God
[54:03] has become so practical to us amen he's
[54:05] become so personal to
[54:08] us
[54:15] amen just as Moses in Mount sa amen he
[54:19] radiated God's glory amen our Liv Our
[54:23] Lives should shine forth
[54:26] with the Light of Christ
[54:28] amen Matthew 5:16 says encourage us
[54:31] saying let your light so shine before
[54:34] men that they may see your good works
[54:37] and glorify your father which is in
[54:41] heaven
[54:42] amen people may see the glory of God in
[54:45] you and then you may give glory to God
[54:48] because all glory will go to God amen
[54:50] amen but they will see God through you
[54:52] yes and who they be giving glory to God
[54:55] God so God wants to be
[54:57] glorified and the way he's glorified is
[54:59] through you and I because why let me let
[55:02] me explain this more properly in a more
[55:05] simple
[55:06] way God needs to be glorified he's the
[55:09] king of glory amen
[55:12] amen and for him to be glorified in this
[55:15] day in this hour they need to see the
[55:17] manifestations of God upon the Earth yes
[55:21] and the only way they can see it is
[55:24] through you and I amen amen and when the
[55:26] sing God being manifested through you
[55:28] and I which means the works that Jesus
[55:31] did Greater Works than is they shall do
[55:34] amen right the works of the Bible that
[55:37] they heard about in history the words
[55:39] that they hear about in the Bible
[55:41] stories they sing it now being
[55:43] manifested through you and I then they
[55:45] will give God the glory then God will be
[55:49] receiving the glory amen amen and he
[55:51] deserves the glory he needs to be
[55:53] glorified God name must be exalted amen
[55:57] that is why through testimonies God is
[55:59] exalted when testimonies happen and you
[56:01] testify who's being exalted are you
[56:04] being popped up and saying no it's my no
[56:06] we exalting God the reason why we give a
[56:08] testimony is because we are glorifying
[56:10] God Amen oh
[56:15] yes but you now if we want to come and
[56:18] live in the realm of his glory we have
[56:20] to abide in his presence
[56:22] amen how do we abide in his presence
[56:26] we have to dedicate ourselves to him yes
[56:29] we have to read the scripture it's
[56:31] normal Christian
[56:33] Life it's not it's a normal Christian
[56:36] work you read the Bible you
[56:39] pray you talk about him amen this is the
[56:43] common
[56:45] problem in the modern world people are
[56:49] ashamed to be associated with Jesus
[56:53] Christ
[56:55] I'm not talking about people say I go to
[56:57] church yeah we go to church we're having
[56:59] a a music
[57:01] show they call them what they call them
[57:05] conc concerts yeah we're having a
[57:08] concert we're having a banquet we having
[57:11] this great youth meeting in the
[57:14] church but are people talking about
[57:16] Jesus talking about the word what is
[57:18] Jesus Jesus is the word yes he said if
[57:21] you love me you will keep my word and my
[57:23] word will not be grieved
[57:27] people are afraid you know I was taking
[57:29] Joseph into school the other day and we
[57:31] saw this people going to the temple and
[57:34] I said josephin see these people are not
[57:37] embarrassed to go and say to go and
[57:39] worship in the temple they're walking in
[57:41] the
[57:42] messes early in the morning and I said
[57:45] see how they dressed up they dressed up
[57:47] decently I said but in church people
[57:51] don't dress up this our church I'm
[57:53] saying in the church world people who
[57:55] say they are Christian how do they dress
[57:58] up because they want to be still
[58:00] associated with the world these people
[58:01] are not of Shame now they're going to
[58:03] worship The God Who no doesn't exist or
[58:06] a demon a demon
[58:10] spirit and they are just declaring
[58:13] themselves
[58:13] properly in a decent
[58:16] manner but people are
[58:20] ashamed and we who profess to be believe
[58:23] the message this should be amongst us as
[58:25] well yes we should be setting the
[58:27] standard not letting the world set the
[58:29] standard US amen the standard shouldn't
[58:34] drop because God's word never changeed
[58:36] amen God we might be living in a modern
[58:39] time yes and maybe we say those things
[58:41] was for those days those Believers in
[58:43] early days no it's the same thing the
[58:46] standard of the message is still the
[58:47] same
[58:50] amen you don't say those days the people
[58:52] used to go in a beach and play at those
[58:54] you got the time to go pray yourself yes
[58:56] go in your closet and pray you don't
[58:58] need to show everybody you don't have to
[59:00] make it a public show between you and
[59:03] God but what you do in the private in
[59:05] secret God will show it in the public
[59:07] amen
[59:10] amen but what is wrong with you now to
[59:13] go and confess God what is wrong for you
[59:15] to go to the street I was speaking to
[59:16] the brother the other day at work and he
[59:18] was telling me he's going house to house
[59:20] he's knocking on doors now desperate to
[59:22] try and get the last one in he's telling
[59:25] me he's going door too
[59:28] evangelizing because why those that are
[59:30] fed with the Holy Ghost are crying and
[59:32] sigh for the abomination of the
[59:35] lost I mean how many time we sit around
[59:37] people different people that we come
[59:39] across do we at least one word of the
[59:42] Gospel at least something something
[59:45] different because everybody's topic is
[59:47] about money is about food the economy
[59:50] and
[59:52] politics how about something different
[59:55] how about eternal life how about
[59:57] presenting eternal life to them eternal
[1:00:00] life is only through Jesus Christ amen
[1:00:03] amen but you and I are the recips of
[1:00:06] eternal
[1:00:07] life but we can share that amen
[1:00:12] yes Psalms 27:4 says one thing I desire
[1:00:17] of the Lord that will I seek after that
[1:00:19] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:00:21] the days of my life amen to behold the
[1:00:24] beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his
[1:00:26] Temple make seeking his presence amen a
[1:00:30] daily Pursuit for us amen each one of us
[1:00:34] should be make seeking the Lord's
[1:00:36] presence our daily goal because that is
[1:00:39] the end game that is the rupture message
[1:00:41] the prophet preached in Psalms 27 in the
[1:00:43] Rapture
[1:00:44] message you can't desire to go in the
[1:00:46] Rapture if you don't start here that's
[1:00:48] because the Rapture cycle already
[1:00:49] started yes amen the
[1:00:51] shout was to gather us together yes amen
[1:00:56] for the Rapture amen because the Bible
[1:00:58] said the bride had made herself
[1:01:03] ready are we doing that every day making
[1:01:06] ourselves ready is that our desire to
[1:01:08] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[1:01:10] days of our life so we going to do it
[1:01:12] there same there wa why we not dwelling
[1:01:14] now in his
[1:01:16] presence we must dwell now in his if you
[1:01:19] you won't be there if you don't dwell
[1:01:21] now if you are not in his presence
[1:01:23] dwelling presence now then you cannot be
[1:01:27] there because you have to be one he said
[1:01:29] father maybe the may they be one even as
[1:01:31] we are
[1:01:32] one you have to be one with him now yes
[1:01:36] that's why Jesus said many were coming
[1:01:38] that day said Lord have I not prophesied
[1:01:40] in your name have I not cast out demons
[1:01:42] in the same he said depart from me
[1:01:44] workers of iniquity I know you not he
[1:01:48] never knew him there wasn't a union with
[1:01:50] him there wasn't an intimacy
[1:01:52] amen but the go gospel is calling us to
[1:01:55] rise above every circumstances
[1:01:57] Amen to rise above our
[1:02:01] troubles Philippians 4:13 says I can do
[1:02:04] all things through him who strengthens
[1:02:07] me amen what gives us strength is the
[1:02:10] glory of God that gives us strength that
[1:02:13] keeps us amen that keeps us from falling
[1:02:16] because let me tell you something if
[1:02:18] it's not the holy if it's not for the
[1:02:19] Holy Ghost We All Fall every day we
[1:02:22] backslide every day we fall the the Holy
[1:02:24] Ghost is bringing conviction every day
[1:02:27] it's the holy ghost that convict you
[1:02:29] spoke the wrong you said you thought the
[1:02:31] wrong thought yes you can't hide what
[1:02:35] Psalm David is saying that in the psalm
[1:02:38] God know his thoughts God know his
[1:02:40] secret whatever he thinking in secret
[1:02:41] God knows it all the things that he
[1:02:43] thinks about even right to the end from
[1:02:46] the time he's born right to his end of
[1:02:47] days God knows it all God seees the
[1:02:50] entire picture you can't hide nothing
[1:02:52] from God Amen is that's why if you're
[1:02:55] conscious of his presence the first
[1:02:57] quote I read what the prophet said if
[1:02:59] you're conscious of his presence you'll
[1:03:00] know that you can't hide nothing from
[1:03:02] him and if you're conscious that the
[1:03:04] holy spirit is with you he's there to
[1:03:06] correct you amen he's there to navigate
[1:03:08] your life yes to put you on the right
[1:03:10] track Amen to put you on the right path
[1:03:13] the straight and narrow road it's not an
[1:03:15] easy
[1:03:19] path of God
[1:03:23] says
[1:03:25] oh I don't want of this Earth I don't
[1:03:28] want Treasures of this Earth I have
[1:03:31] Treasures in Heaven he said thank God
[1:03:33] one day I stepped into the astronaut
[1:03:35] tube the body of Jesus Christ baptized
[1:03:37] in there by the Holy
[1:03:39] Ghost and watching waiting listening at
[1:03:42] the
[1:03:42] countdown I seen the anges Ages come
[1:03:46] by come by come come by to the last age
[1:03:50] is counted off the next breath it's more
[1:03:52] than 3 minutes I mean less than 3
[1:03:55] minutes sence says it's 3 minutes for
[1:03:57] the earth to be blowed up in time it's
[1:03:59] less than the next breath of Jehovah is
[1:04:01] come out of it my people come up higher
[1:04:04] we watch right here before the time
[1:04:06] comes and see the glorious power of God
[1:04:09] return to the church the presence of
[1:04:11] Jesus Christ the only presence showing
[1:04:13] that what he is and where he is and
[1:04:16] right amongst us doing the same works
[1:04:19] that he promised would be done in this
[1:04:21] age yeah he is proving that he's the
[1:04:24] same amen yes and that's what he's doing
[1:04:27] right here amen yes
[1:04:29] amen we're not talking about now A Time
[1:04:31] by we talking about it now amen cuz

[1:10:25] things and he was caught up in the
[1:10:27] vision caught up into
[1:10:30] Glory his experience must have been
[1:10:32] something like that of Paul 2
[1:10:34] Corinthians 12:2 to 4 and he says Paul
[1:10:38] was caught up one day into a vision too
[1:10:41] did you know that and he saw things that
[1:10:43] wasn't expedient for him to even talk
[1:10:45] about 14 years not even mentioned it but
[1:10:49] listen at the difference between them
[1:10:50] when Paul saw he was forbidden to speak
[1:10:53] of it or to put it down out to the
[1:10:58] public he saw things that he couldn't
[1:11:01] talk about a guess he didn't have the
[1:11:02] words he was caught up in a third heaven
[1:11:05] how different when John was caught up
[1:11:07] and seen Jesus you was he said write it
[1:11:10] in a book what you have seen and give it
[1:11:13] back send it back to the churches Paul
[1:11:17] was forbidden to speak and John was even
[1:11:19] asked to put it in a book so it would
[1:11:22] all go down to the ages amen but it was
[1:11:25] sealed up but in this age in the days of
[1:11:28] the voice of the Seven Angels when he
[1:11:30] shall he shall begin to sound the
[1:11:32] mystery of God shall be revealed amen
[1:11:35] and now that it's revealed it was still
[1:11:37] stored
[1:11:39] up amen yes cuz he's preaching in a time
[1:11:43] when you and I was not
[1:11:45] there it was preserved and stored up but
[1:11:49] now once again this message has come to
[1:11:52] the Holy Ghost amen and now how he's
[1:11:54] bringing it out to the five-fold
[1:11:56] ministry bringing it back again the same
[1:11:58] very word but now he's making it plain
[1:12:01] to you amen this word that was was
[1:12:04] sealed up is not sealed anymore it's
[1:12:06] plain through the why through the
[1:12:08] message of William brandham who's come
[1:12:10] and brought this message but it was stor
[1:12:12] up for this time for this hour when now
[1:12:14] you will eat it and the word becomes
[1:12:16] practical now now it becomes a
[1:12:19] manifestation amen this word that you
[1:12:21] eaten up now now it's manifested is now
[1:12:24] become a manifested word yes not a
[1:12:28] written word not a revealed word but a
[1:12:31] manifested word amen through a many
[1:12:34] membered body that is why when you are
[1:12:37] fulled with the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:12:39] just see yourself as part of just oh we
[1:12:42] this is my church this is my people you

[1:13:41] common enemy that is Satan but we are
[1:13:44] one body Christ amen you have to see
[1:13:47] that one amen that is why Satan tried to
[1:13:50] put the conterfeit and they all saying
[1:13:52] now we are one body that's why the pope
[1:13:54] is gathering all the Protestants
[1:13:55] together he's seeing the counterfeit

[1:13:59] but if there's a counterfeit there must
[1:14:00] be the genuine yes amen amen if there's
[1:14:04] a false anointed one there must be the
