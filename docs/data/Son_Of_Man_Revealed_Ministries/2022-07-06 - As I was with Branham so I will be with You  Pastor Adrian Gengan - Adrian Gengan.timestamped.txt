[0:18] communication from god so much that god
[0:22] even asked the angels to transport this
[0:24] man's body
[0:26] god provided transportation because he
[0:29] did not want moses body to decay because
[0:32] he had a further work for a future time

[0:58] general full of courage
[1:00] strong in faith he led the people in the
[1:03] land and was fighting and overcoming
[1:06] amen just that god promised him he would
[1:08] never leave him he was with him he was
[1:11] true to his word and joshua was not

[1:31] will fight our battles for us amen but
[1:34] we gotta surrender over to him
[1:37] amen he promised he would never leave
[1:39] him nor forsake him even the sin of
[1:42] achar did not enter the move of god
[1:45] amen that was a quick word they dealt
[1:47] with the sin of aiken and they kept on
[1:49] moving off don't let sin stop the church
[1:52] this was an army that was marching
[1:54] according to the orders of the general
[1:57] who was receiving orders from the
[1:59] captain of the host amen
[2:01] joshua add other platoon leaders
[2:05] amen you know our war is amen you have
[2:08] leaders you have centurions you have all
[2:11] these people
[2:12] captains and platoon leaders amen and
[2:15] one of those platoon leaders was caleb
[2:18] amen caleb was one of the original
[2:20] believers that left egypt he was a man
[2:23] full of faith
[2:24] he was he had a different anointing on
[2:26] him the bible says he had a different
[2:28] spirit amen in fact his art was turned
[2:31] back to the original faith
[2:33] of the fathers
[2:35] hallelujah
[2:36] he experienced when
[2:38] moses went up into the mountain was
[2:41] caught up into the cloud and received
[2:43] instruction to go and take the ten
[2:45] commandments to the people
[2:47] amen in fact caleb was a law abiding
[2:50] citizen he obeyed all ten commandments
[2:53] amen
[2:54] nothing could shake his experience
[2:57] he had seen it all from egypt
[3:00] right until this time when they entered
[3:02] the promised land he was one of them
[3:04] that went to spy out the land and came
[3:07] back with the evidence that the land is
[3:08] overflowing with milk and honey
[3:11] now remember all 10 spa said the same
[3:13] thing
[3:14] the lamb is good
[3:16] it's overflowing with milk and honey
[3:18] then they said but
[3:20] yes amen
[3:22] but
[3:24] when the doubters want to doubt you use
[3:26] the word but
[3:27] but we have another butt
[3:29] in revelation 10 7
[3:44] amen we see these people in the land
[3:46] they are like giants amen we look like
[3:48] grasshoppers in front of them
[3:50] amen but a little unbelief should not
[3:53] put fear into the people of god amen
[3:56] amen hallelujah don't let a little
[4:00] little living
[4:01] amen
[4:02] live in the whole lamp amen you
[4:05] eliminate that little level that little
[4:07] unbelief pluck it out of the church
[4:10] amen
[4:12] hallelujah he got the others trembling
[4:15] but while they were trembling caleb
[4:17] stands up before moses and in numbers 13
[4:19] verse 30 he says caleb steal the people
[4:23] before moses
[4:34] i've got something to say
[4:37] and here's the testimony of caleb he
[4:40] says let us go up at once
[4:42] don't delay
[4:45] go today
[4:46] and possess it for we are well able to
[4:49] overcome it
[4:51] what was he saying
[4:53] how moses has already
[5:06] amen he was saying overcoming power is
[5:09] what we have today so god gave joshua
[5:11] the promise that he was to invite
[5:13] remember now listen to this
[5:15] god told joshua he was going to fight
[5:18] the entire campaign
[5:21] with an army
[5:23] but without a medical
[5:25] team
[5:28] there was no medical staff
[5:30] there was no nurses
[5:33] there was no first aid kits they didn't
[5:35] have the salvation army
[5:37] the land is yours go fight amen think of
[5:40] finding a war with no medical staff
[5:42] because nobody's gonna get hurt amen
[5:45] and that's what was promised to them
[5:47] amen amen they slew the amorites they
[5:50] slow the intakes without a single
[5:52] soldier being injured or killed
[5:54] that's a church marching in the will of
[5:57] god marching in the program of god no
[6:00] casualties amen
[6:03] hallelujah that was the first exodus
[6:05] amen that's how god was with moses and
[6:08] he proved that he was with joshua
[6:11] amen
[6:12] same scientific manifestations same
[6:14] overcoming power
[6:16] amen one spoke about them going into the
[6:19] land and one led them into the land with
[6:22] caleb backing them up

[6:30] here but the believers the caleb and
[6:32] joshua outfit that was going on to the
[6:35] promise they moved on over into the land
[6:38] and they took the land and settled down
[6:40] in the land as a possession
[6:42] he says we the same way now remember we
[6:45] are going into our promised land which
[6:47] is the holy ghost
[6:48] he says let us stop at justification
[6:52] sanctification
[6:54] let's go on to the baptism of the holy
[6:56] spirit let's not stop at believing on
[6:59] the lord jesus christ being baptized

[7:04] from a life of sin
[7:07] amen
[7:09] did he cleanse us from a life of sin

[7:14] position to a promise of the baptism of
[7:18] the holy ghost for peter said on the day

[10:07] luke 24 48
[10:10] just before our lord jesus ascends up to
[10:12] heaven
[10:13] he says you are witnesses of these
[10:15] things
[10:17] and behold i
[10:19] personal pronoun i send the promise of
[10:21] my father upon you
[10:24] but carry in the city of jerusalem
[10:27] until you endure with power from an eye
[10:32] amen what was he telling him as i as the
[10:35] father said as i was with jesus i will
[10:37] be with the new testament believer
[10:40] you're going to be endured with power
[10:42] amen how is god with jesus
[10:45] amen he turned water into wine he healed
[10:48] the he raised the dead he opened
[10:50] the eyes of the blind he created
[10:52] eyeballs
[10:54] our god is a creator
[10:56] he opened up the deaf ears he walked on
[10:59] water amen he forgave the sinners amen
[11:02] he loved the unlovable he saved the
[11:05] unsavable
[11:06] amen hallelujah he spoke to the wind on
[11:10] the stormy sea and the man and one time
[11:13] he cursed the fig tree
[11:14] amen and god backed up his word
[11:18] hallelujah this was the creator in flesh
[11:22] creation for the first time after 4 000
[11:25] years would see another adam
[11:29] amen what was jesus doing like moses
[11:32] destabilized the egyptian empire
[11:35] jesus was destabilizing the roman empire
[11:38] amen he was rocking the religious
[11:40] kingdom
[11:41] amen he was shaking up the spiritual
[11:43] realm of hell
[11:44] amen they didn't know what to do with
[11:46] jesus the religious leaders didn't know
[11:49] what to do with him so they conspired a
[11:51] story amen but pilate couldn't find no
[11:55] in him
[11:56] amen but still they whipped him with 39
[11:58] stripes
[12:00] amen they nailed him to a cruel cross
[12:02] and put a crown of thorns upon his head
[12:06] thinking that they would silence him
[12:09] that that would be the end of this
[12:11] fanaticism
[12:13] hallelujah but that was only the
[12:15] beginning
[12:17] that wasn't the end of jesus
[12:19] that was just the beginning
[12:22] amen the grave couldn't hold him down
[12:25] three days in the grave was enough for
[12:27] him to do his work beyond the grave amen
[12:31] once it looked like he was defeated and
[12:33] his body lay in a borrowed tomb
[12:36] they even set up god around the tomb to
[12:38] guard the body
[12:40] amen it looked like he was defeated but
[12:43] in reality he was defeating satan and
[12:46] his kingdom in his theophany body
[12:48] melchizedek was at work amen then on
[12:52] sunday morning at the rising of the
[12:54] s-u-n amen the s-o-n
[12:58] raised triumphantly
[13:00] amen from the grave and he stepped into
[13:03] his glorified body

[13:08] from melchizedek anymore

[13:13] did the greater words he walked two
[13:15] walls amen he changed dimensions he
[13:18] ascended 40 days later and he passed
[13:21] every star he passed the sixth dimension
[13:24] he passed amen all the heavens amen and
[13:27] god raised him up so high amen
[13:31] into the seventh dimension and gave him
[13:34] a name above every other name
[13:36] amen a name that at the name of jesus
[13:39] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[13:42] confess that he is lord amen
[13:45] amen hallelujah give the lord another
[13:48] good answer for praise amen that's the
[13:50] king of kings and that's the lord of
[13:53] lords
[13:54] and god backed up his word
[13:56] when he told him go into the upper room
[13:58] and carry there
[14:00] amen we know what happened in acts
[14:02] chapter 2
[14:04] the holy spirit comes down like a sound
[14:06] of a mighty rushing wind
[14:09] he says like cloven tongues of fire
[14:11] and set upon each and every one of them
[14:14] 120
[14:17] in the upper room
[14:18] waiting for the promise
[14:21] all of them endured with power
[14:24] amen all of them stumbling out of that
[14:26] room like drunk man
[14:28] amen filled with the holy ghost
[14:31] hallelujah amen
[14:34] amen the prophet of god tells us if it
[14:36] fell on them that way it will fall at
[14:38] every true believer in the same way amen
[14:41] we should be so drunk in the spirit of
[14:43] god that somebody should scream amen you
[14:46] know you can't keep a drunk man quiet
[14:48] he's just rowdy all the time
[14:50] amen so too are people that are drunk of
[14:53] the spirit of god amen they said amen
[14:56] they say hallelujah
[14:59] hallelujah amen and god backed up his
[15:02] word when he said as i was with jesus
[15:04] i'm going to be with you and new
[15:06] testament believers and these signs
[15:08] shall follow them that believe if they
[15:10] lay hands upon the sick they shall
[15:12] recover amen so much soul peter walking
[15:16] through the gate called beautiful one
[15:17] day and here's a man begging amen and he
[15:20] said silver and gold am i not but such
[15:23] as i have give i unto you in the name of
[15:26] jesus rise up and walk
[15:29] same power same manifestation
[15:32] amen hallelujah you can read how they
[15:35] raised up darkest

[15:39] they called for peter to come
[15:42] peter
[15:43] come
[15:45] her name was tabitha also called jokers

[15:50] amen
[15:52] and similar thing happen watch the
[15:54] experiences they learn from the
[15:56] experiences because when jesus went to
[15:59] raise up another tabitha
[16:03] jamie's daughter
[16:04] you remember what he said
[16:09] take them out of the room
[16:11] he took peter and john inside amen
[16:14] only the believers were full of faith
[16:16] amen hallelujah amen
[16:19] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[16:22] some of you don't know the john that he
[16:24] took inside was the same john in
[16:25] revelation 10.
[16:30] amen amen
[16:32] hallelujah
[16:34] and he took unbelief out of the house
[16:36] amen and jesus said daughter arrives
[16:40] you see peter does the exact same thing
[16:43] he goes into the house everyone else is
[16:45] sent out
[16:46] and the holy spirit comes into the room
[16:48] and that girl is raised back to life
[16:52] amen
[16:53] same sign same manifestations
[16:56] same power
[16:57] amen
[16:58] what he could what jesus was one man
[17:01] and the signs could only go wherever you
[17:04] went physically
[17:05] amen but here now the power was split
[17:08] into 120 people and from there that one
[17:11] service that they have the bible says
[17:13] about 3 000 souls were baptized in jesus
[17:17] name
[17:18] the gospel started to spread
[17:21] hallelujah
[17:23] amen you can read miracle after miracle
[17:26] in the book of acts
[17:28] and the brother of god says that this
[17:30] bride will rewrite the book of acts
[17:33] amen hallelujah
[17:35] so get your testimonies ready
[17:38] be rewriting the book of acts
[17:40] amen build upon your most holy faith
[17:44] this evening hallelujah
[17:46] because these signs still follow them
[17:48] that believe
[17:49] amen hallelujah aren't you glad that you
[17:53] are a new testament believer
[17:55] endured with power from an eye
[17:57] amen
[17:58] jesus said greater words than thee shall
[18:00] he do
[18:02] for i go unto my father amen amen
[18:05] hallelujah you have a divine quality
[18:08] about you
[18:09] that divine quality is the holy spirit
[18:11] the holy ghost anointing that's upon you
[18:14] amen it's not there for fancy words
[18:18] amen is there to display the power of
[18:20] god
[18:21] yes
[18:22] amen
[18:23] hallelujah coming to the third exodus
[18:26] now
[18:28] as i was with branham
[18:30] so will i be with you
[18:32] amen
[18:35] i don't need to tell you the state that
[18:36] the church was in
[18:38] by the time brother branham came in on
[18:40] the scene
[18:42] amen
[18:45] it had started out with the outpouring
[18:47] of the holy spirit at azusa street
[18:50] but it soon died down into
[18:51] denominationalism
[18:53] into creeds and darkness and baptisms
[18:56] and all of these things
[18:58] like paul says let us not lay the
[19:00] foundations again but let us move on to
[19:02] perfection
[19:03] but they are denominated around an idea
[19:08] amen
[19:09] and each church was trying to win the
[19:11] lost
[19:12] and each one had a slogan a million more
[19:14] by 44. amen each one was trying to build
[19:18] up their organization
[19:22] hallelujah scripture for this is
[19:25] revelation 10 10
[19:26] as i was with branham so will i be with
[19:29] you
[19:30] and i took the little book out of the
[19:32] angel town that same book was in
[19:34] branham's hand
[19:36] in revelation 10 7.
[19:38] i took the book out of the angel's hand
[19:40] and ate it out
[19:41] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[19:44] and as as soon as i had eaten it my
[19:46] belly was bitter and he said unto me
[19:50] thou must prophesy again amen before
[19:52] many peoples nations tongues and kings
[19:57] amen and this bright prophecy is not of
[20:00] the letter only because the letter
[20:02] killeth but this bride is filled with
[20:04] the spirit of god amen hallelujah she is
[20:08] packed with the mechanics but she also
[20:11] has the dynamics
[20:13] amen hallelujah
[20:16] we cannot
[20:17] out quote one another
[20:21] amen
[20:22] we cannot win arguments by quotes
[20:25] you cannot win arguments and defeat
[20:27] satan kingdom by the mechanics
[20:30] hallelujah satan loves to quote
[20:33] in fact he's got the church word and the
[20:35] message world so much against one
[20:37] another that it's one fighting the other
[20:39] with another quote
[20:41] quote against quote
[20:43] but you cannot fight this battle with
[20:46] the mechanics
[20:48] you gotta have the dynamics to give the
[20:51] mechanics life
[20:52] amen hallelujah
[20:56] we cannot say that we are just heroes of
[20:59] the world in fact we have become fat
[21:02] eagles in the message
[21:04] too much quotes that we know
[21:06] too much intellectualism that we know
[21:09] but the same person has no power within
[21:11] them
[21:12] only quote quote quote tell them pray
[21:15] for the sick and see the results of it
[21:17] there's no result
[21:19] they do not have faith but these signs
[21:21] shall follow them that believe amen
[21:24] amen hallelujah
[21:26] it seems like people don't want to
[21:28] believe the scriptures anymore oh we
[21:30] have the opening of the word we don't
[21:32] have need for any other thing you lying
[21:34] demon
[21:37] amen
[21:39] the church of god in a power packed
[21:40] church
[21:42] amen it's the holy ghost field church
[21:44] amen people you know why they want doing
[21:47] there they want to only injure on the
[21:49] one part of it
[21:51] is because they are backslidden
[21:54] when it comes time for the evidence god
[21:56] is not going to ask you how much quotes
[21:58] do you know
[22:00] repeat to me
[22:05] he wants to see the life
[22:07] back it up for the dynamics
[22:09] he wants to see the life
[22:11] amen
[22:13] hallelujah
[22:15] don't tell me about seven virtues when
[22:16] that seven virtues are not in you
[22:20] you can preach it as a doctrine you can

[23:32] forerun the second coming
[23:34] amen to the angel meeting him in the
[23:36] cave and telling him he would take the
[23:38] gift of healing to the nations of the
[23:41] world

[23:45] god

[24:11] what we were talking about jesus
[24:13] he spoke to the storm amen hallelujah
[24:16] and it was calm again he spoke one time
[24:19] to a killer bull amen and he did not

[24:39] amen
[24:41] and what a legacy that has just passed
[24:43] us by and the patron has been passed
[24:46] over to us
[24:47] and we are walking around with stupid
[24:49] shoulders shoulders
[24:51] feeling defeated when satan just got the
[24:54] whipping of his life a few years ago
[24:56] amen
[24:57] now he wants to come try is luck with
[25:00] you
[25:01] but we want to give it to the devil
[25:02] every time we feel down and our feelings
[25:05] are hurt
[25:06] we want to leave church and church
[25:07] hopping we got a lot of bunny rabbits in
[25:09] the message who like to hop
[25:14] amen
[25:15] up over here hop over there hop
[25:17] everywhere
[25:19] but they still claim to be in the body
[25:20] of christ
[25:23] but they have ought against you and
[25:25] enmity against you
[25:27] they think by leaving this church and
[25:29] going to another church or leaving that
[25:31] church and coming to this church solves
[25:33] the problem
[25:35] it doesn't solve the problem because you
[25:37] are the problem
[25:42] no amen's for that
[25:44] people don't believe people like to sit
[25:45] on the fence
[25:47] people don't have discernment the lord
[25:49] paul told them how are you going to
[25:50] judge the earth when you can't deserve
[25:53] matters amongst you
[25:54] you ask people to judge a matter i can't
[25:56] take sides
[25:59] i want to sit on the fence
[26:02] how do you know who was right and who
[26:03] was wrong
[26:04] you're a lying demon
[26:07] yes
[26:08] you know what that is an hypocrite
[26:11] that's an hypocrite
[26:14] a person who cannot judge between right
[26:16] and wrong wants to sit on the fence
[26:18] and say i don't want to take sides
[26:20] you're not take you'd rather take sides
[26:22] with jesus yes take sides of the word
[26:25] amen
[26:27] people don't like straight preaching but
[26:28] you need to hear them amen amen we're
[26:30] tired of what wishing washing christians
[26:33] with no backbones
[26:35] and that's how you let unbelief stay in
[26:37] the church
[26:39] by leaving people like that
[26:41] we need rugged christians
[26:43] we need soldiers in the church
[26:46] amen that's why the gospel is not
[26:48] advancing forward wish you worship what
[26:50] the prophet called him jellyfish
[26:52] christians
[26:57] amen
[26:59] keep popping
[27:01] one day you'll make your last stop
[27:05] amen
[27:06] he spoke squirrels into existence he
[27:09] spoke meera's tumor out of existence yes
[27:12] he gave salvation to actually writes two
[27:14] boys
[27:17] and there was no impersonation of this
[27:18] ministry
[27:21] show me an impersonation of the pillar
[27:22] of fire above three grams head
[27:26] show me the impersonation
[27:29] of the pillar fire over oral robertson
[27:34] you can't impersonate it
[27:38] even hollywood with a special effects
[27:41] can't reproduce the cloud happening
[27:47] okay
[27:48] because they didn't know
[27:50] to turn it to the right
[27:53] when these heathens on on youtube are
[27:55] trying to dispute the cloud and they're
[27:56] turning it to the right
[27:59] they have no business turning you to the
[28:01] right because they don't know
[28:03] if they're turning it to the right then
[28:04] they're believing the prophet that's
[28:05] right because he told him tonight to the
[28:07] right
[28:08] it was viewed the way it was taken
[28:11] the moment they turn it to the right and
[28:13] try to dispute it tell them you're lying
[28:15] demon
[28:19] amen
[28:22] the enemy will be exposed
[28:24] amen unbelief will be exposed
[28:27] when the spirit of god is moving you
[28:29] will root out all unbelief
[28:31] but you'll find resistance to it
[28:33] but we've got to press forward
[28:35] amen so no impersonation of the pillar
[28:38] of fire
[28:40] no impersonation
[28:42] of the throne room that was caught you
[28:44] all know the throne room picture
[28:46] the one where the lilies
[28:48] came up
[28:50] one picture the plants are normal
[28:53] next thing there's amber light
[28:56] lilies are grown up
[28:58] that's called the throne room one right
[29:01] caught in the camera while she was
[29:02] preaching
[29:04] then he was caught up in the
[29:05] constellation of seven angels
[29:08] nobody wanted to impersonate that
[29:12] and receive the commission from the
[29:14] mighty angel
[29:16] the mighty angel that came down in
[29:17] revelation 10
[29:18] william branham met him
[29:20] yes
[29:22] how do you know he met him
[29:24] brother brandon when he's talking about
[29:27] him standing there
[29:29] with his hands raised to the air
[29:32] and he says that sword fell into his
[29:34] hand amen
[29:36] and then he's trying to understand
[29:38] why the sword
[29:40] and then he said it must have been
[29:41] somebody standing there next to me
[29:45] it was wreaking sword amen
[29:49] hallelujah
[29:51] what a mighty ministry
[29:54] can we compare
[29:56] that is not based on us
[29:58] he's based on our submission yes
[30:00] he's based on our faith yes
[30:03] but he's gonna back up his word yes amen
[30:07] amen
[30:09] he unsealed the seven seals
[30:12] and the seven thunders
[30:13] the trumpets the files and the glorious
[30:16] mysteries that are locked up in the book
[30:18] of revelation yes
[30:20] amen
[30:22] there shouldn't be a single thing in the
[30:24] book of revelation that this bride does
[30:26] not understand that's right amen yes
[30:29] because every step of the way didn't an
[30:30] angel come before him
[30:32] and reveal to john
[30:34] and show showing these things so
[30:36] majestic was his angel
[30:38] and so similar was he to christ that
[30:40] john wanted to bow down before him
[30:45] but sons and daughters of god
[30:47] amen
[30:48] are following william branham
[30:51] sons and daughters of god have been
[30:53] following william branham
[30:55] amen when i say following william
[30:57] branham they have come after him
[31:00] amen they have been called out from
[31:01] every genominational system they have
[31:04] been called out amen to come up a little
[31:07] higher
[31:08] amen sons and daughters have a greater
[31:10] weapon
[31:11] then now they're talking about an atomic
[31:13] bomb
[31:14] you must have heard belarus the one
[31:17] that's in alliance with russia he's
[31:19] asking russia to
[31:21] what they call it
[31:23] he says to prepare your nuclear warfare
[31:27] they just asked them to do that the
[31:29] other day
[31:31] it says please prepare your atomic
[31:33] warfare
[31:35] because nato is about
[31:37] they feel that nature is going to attack
[31:39] the whole world is trembling because of
[31:41] atomic warfare
[31:42] amen but we as sons and daughters of god
[31:46] we we spoke about moses destabilizing
[31:48] egypt
[31:49] we spoke about jesus destabilizing the
[31:52] roman empire
[31:54] we spoke about branham destabilizing the
[31:56] religious system of that day and even
[31:58] took on 300 denominational giants
[32:02] that came there to challenge him
[32:04] amen but when he went in the front with
[32:06] his bible and he said if any of you can
[32:09] dispute or disprove anything that i've
[32:11] preached from this bible bring your
[32:13] bible and come stand next to me he says
[32:15] not one of them moved
[32:16] all of them shut up
[32:19] he silenced them
[32:22] if they they stabilized destabilized all
[32:25] of these kingdoms the pride of jesus
[32:27] christ is here to destabilize satan's
[32:30] kingdom
[32:31] at the end time
[32:34] and this time they are going to do a
[32:36] good and complete work
[32:38] because it's the end of time
[32:40] amen satan's kingdom is going to be
[32:42] brought down
[32:44] amen i'm talking about the curtain of
[32:46] the gentile kingdom
[32:49] this bread closes up the gentile kingdom
[32:52] amen and satan cannot mess with the
[32:54] gentile kingdom anymore
[32:57] because this bride finishes off once and
[33:00] for all even he can't find us when the
[33:02] rapture takes place
[33:06] satan is going to put a missing person's
[33:08] report for you i should love to torment
[33:11] this person i can't find them
[33:14] yes
[33:16] amen
[33:19] amen
[33:20] hallelujah
[33:22] and how do we destabilize
[33:24] and annihilate the kingdom of satan
[33:27] reports
[33:30] head knowledge
[33:33] reminding him what
[33:34] happened two thousand years ago
[33:36] reminding him what happened in the days
[33:38] of the prophet
[33:40] we need to raise him out of history
[33:42] jesus christ the same yesterday
[33:45] today and forever
[33:48] satan is not interested in how much you
[33:49] can quote yes
[33:52] amen is looking for that life
[33:55] what life holy spirit life
[33:59] power
[34:00] now he says let's see what atomic
[34:02] warfare we got you want to see if we got
[34:03] atomic warfare
[34:05] let's read
[34:07] what man calls great god calls foolish
[34:10] what man calls foolish god calls great
[34:13] so what we've got to do is get back into
[34:16] the program of god and find out
[34:18] after all what god wants us to do and
[34:21] the only way i know to do it is prayer
[34:27] i thought it would be some super duper
[34:29] thing i can go stand on the mountain and
[34:32] say here he or phoenix people
[34:37] he are doomed
[34:39] i have atomic warfare
[34:42] no
[34:44] he says
[34:45] the only way i know to do it is prayer
[34:47] yes amen and prayer not like the muslim
[34:50] man now
[34:52] you don't get the idea yes i'm going to
[34:54] get this loud on and
[34:56] pray for the
[34:57] secret prayer
[35:02] prayer is the key
[35:04] amen
[35:05] wow
[35:06] yes
[35:07] you want 21st key
[35:09] don't get 21st key without this key
[35:14] okay
[35:15] prayer is the key
[35:18] you want an answer to your to what
[35:20] you're asking the lord he says that's
[35:21] the answer
[35:23] so prayer is the key
[35:25] prayer is the answer
[35:27] prayer changes things
[35:30] amen
[35:31] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[35:34] was ever put in the control of human
[35:36] beings
[35:40] one time
[35:41] the prophet came to the king you're
[35:43] going to die
[35:45] i don't want to beat around the bush and
[35:46] tell you hey you know
[35:47] things are looking fine
[35:49] he said you're going to die
[35:52] the prophet says i didn't copy the whole
[35:54] culture
[35:56] the next paragraph after this he deals
[35:58] with that
[35:58] he says prayer
[36:00] changed the mind of god
[36:03] and he added 15 more years to his life
[36:07] he says prayer changes things pray is
[36:10] the most powerful weapon that was ever
[36:12] in the control of the human beings
[36:16] there's no atomic bomb
[36:18] no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[36:22] amen
[36:25] prayer will change the mind of god
[36:28] did you know that it did do it one time
[36:31] and then he goes to explain it now
[36:32] please when you go home
[36:34] don't pray for putin not to release the
[36:37] bonds
[36:42] don't pray that lord prolonged things
[36:46] pray tell do like jesus said tell judas
[36:49] go do what you must do quickly
[36:53] if you've got social media accounts put
[36:55] the hashtag
[36:56] hashtag him
[36:58] putin whatever go find his handle
[37:00] and tell him do what you must do quickly
[37:07] amen
[37:09] we know that hallie's shaking
[37:11] do you know when you walk into a place
[37:13] why demons tremble why spirits manifest
[37:17] when you walk into a room and people are
[37:18] not happy to see you
[37:20] that's a spirit within them
[37:23] yes sometimes in the flesh we take it
[37:25] personally i was telling our brother
[37:27] joshua is there he says no man that's a
[37:29] spirit being upset
[37:31] that you walked into the room
[37:35] hey
[37:38] hell is shaking when you walk into their
[37:40] presence
[37:42] you walk into a home
[37:44] and you watch how they scatter
[37:46] like cockroaches when you put the light
[37:48] on
[37:57] your power
[37:59] i have given you power
[38:01] amen
[38:02] what power holy ghost power
[38:05] to train on serpents
[38:08] and scorpions
[38:10] and overcome all the power of the enemy
[38:14] not some of the power
[38:18] now jesus is not talking about little
[38:20] serpents and scorpions here
[38:24] he's talking about satan's kingdom
[38:27] he's calling them serpents and scorpions
[38:30] and all the power of the enemy
[38:33] and nothing shall by any means hurt you
[38:36] what the enemy means for evil god will
[38:39] turn it for your good yes amen
[38:43] they're planning at work to fire you
[38:44] they're to promote you
[38:48] stop being fearful
[38:50] you're going for a job interview tell
[38:52] them how much you want
[38:54] tell them otherwise you cannot have the
[38:56] son of god
[39:00] don't be fearful do you know what fear
[39:02] has done
[39:03] fears let you settle into the job that
[39:05] you are in right now
[39:06] you took whatever they offered you
[39:09] and you're hoping they don't fire you
[39:13] but faith will tell them this is how
[39:15] much i require
[39:19] i am no ordinary person
[39:21] you are employing a holy ghost field son
[39:24] or daughter of god
[39:27] if you want to know references phone
[39:29] this reference here see joseph in the
[39:31] bible
[39:32] they put him in port of his house
[39:34] that's my relative
[39:36] you want contacts they ask me for
[39:38] context isn't it where what contact
[39:41] who's your contact person
[39:42] tell them joseph in the bible
[39:44] they can put me in part of his house
[39:47] they can put me in prison
[39:50] but pharaoh made me in charge over the
[39:52] whole land amen
[39:54] you know even pharaoh's children had to
[39:56] bow before joseph
[39:59] the bible says
[40:01] everyone
[40:03] everybody
[40:04] had to bow before joseph
[40:07] the only one that was exempt was pharaoh
[40:10] even pharaoh's children when joseph was
[40:12] coming and they blew that trumpet must
[40:14] bow before joseph
[40:18] so tell them i come from a
[40:20] rich heritage
[40:22] i know what i am i know i'm worth
[40:24] i don't go there and slack on the job
[40:26] now i'm ready to switch to the family
[40:27] name
[40:29] okay
[40:32] you wanna
[40:33] claim joseph what you're gonna work like
[40:34] laban
[40:38] no don't do that
[40:40] make the family name proud okay he says
[40:43] here
[40:44] not with standing now watch he says i've
[40:46] given you all of this power trample on
[40:48] snakes scorpions overcome all the enemy
[40:51] schemes but he says notwithstanding now
[40:54] watch he's going to give you a
[40:55] revelation here
[40:56] don't rejoice in the souls only
[40:59] that the spirits are subject unto you
[41:02] but rather rejoice because your names
[41:04] are written in heaven
[41:06] amen amen and let me tell you there's
[41:09] only one group of people that have seen
[41:11] the unsealed book
[41:14] with their names on it that can truly
[41:16] rejoice
[41:17] because when john saw john
[41:20] like the prophet says he says all of
[41:22] heaven and all of earth heard me rejoice
[41:28] amen greater than that amen hallelujah
[41:32] if you really want hell to tremble is
[41:35] see your name in the book
[41:38] show him your title dear
[41:40] kick satan off your property
[41:44] kick satan off he's a squatter
[41:46] in fact satan is used to being kicked
[41:48] out
[41:49] he was kicked out of heaven
[41:52] when jesus went into hell he gave him
[41:54] another kick yes
[41:56] amen he got kicked in hell when jesus
[41:58] took the keys of death hell and the
[42:00] grave
[42:01] satan knows your shoe size
[42:04] anytime you get
[42:06] you don't forget your shoe size or
[42:08] somebody wants to buy your payoff shoe
[42:09] and you forgot
[42:10] ask satan
[42:14] because your foot is supposed to be
[42:16] honest
[42:21] he should never speak to you from an
[42:22] elevated position that's right amen
[42:25] if he wants to speak to you he must
[42:27] speak to you from the dust of the earth
[42:29] amen amen satan knows your shoe size
[42:32] because the believer has their foot on
[42:34] the head of the serpent
[42:37] now here's prophecy
[42:39] amen
[42:40] you are the invincible army you're close
[42:44] he says christ in the true church are
[42:46] you the true church
[42:48] is a continuation of the book of acts
[42:49] are you rewriting the book of acts
[42:52] amen hallelujah
[42:54] the book of revelation shows how the
[42:56] antichrist spirit would come into the
[42:58] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[43:01] formal and powerless
[43:03] so anything that's coming now to make
[43:05] you lukewarm formal and powerless
[43:08] don't only look for the catholic church
[43:10] judas was in the church
[43:14] within the message if they are trying to
[43:16] make you formal
[43:17] if they are trying to make you look warm
[43:19] and powerless
[43:21] that's the antichrist spirit it says it
[43:23] exposes satan revealing his works
[43:27] amen right down to the time he's cast
[43:29] into the lake of fire
[43:31] he fights that
[43:33] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[43:35] people get the true revelation of the
[43:37] true church and what she is what she
[43:40] stands for that she can do the greater
[43:43] works
[43:45] that's prophecy for you
[43:47] you shall do the greater works
[43:50] in fact you are doing the greater works
[43:52] amen
[43:56] she will be an invincible army
[43:59] invading satan's kingdom
[44:01] pulling down every principality pulling
[44:04] down every stronghold
[44:07] amen satan will be powerless before her
[44:13] amen
[44:16] how many of you play mortal kombat
[44:19] young people don't know what mortal
[44:20] kombat is
[44:23] you know when you're eating that guy in
[44:24] the end his only body is only going like
[44:26] this
[44:27] and that's voice is finishing
[44:30] so satan is powerless
[44:33] he's standing like that before you
[44:36] but is he sinking
[44:40] you know what is he saying
[44:41] when jesus kicked him all his teeth came
[44:43] out
[44:46] that's why he whistles like that
[44:48] hey
[44:51] amen
[44:52] he says
[44:56] satan will be powerless
[44:58] before you yes
[45:01] amen
[45:03] he will be as definitely toward it today
[45:06] as when christ withstood his every
[45:08] effort to gain power over him in the
[45:10] desert
[45:11] satan hates revelation but we love it
[45:14] with true revelation in our lives the
[45:16] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[45:19] but we will prevail over them
[45:23] amen
[45:24] in another another message in church
[45:26] book he says the people who took his
[45:28] revelation from god
[45:30] became living epistles read and known of
[45:34] all men for their generation
[45:38] right
[45:38] better than knowing the dynamics
[45:42] better than you quoting the dynamics
[45:44] they must read the dynamics
[45:47] sorry better than them you're quoting
[45:49] them the mechanics
[45:50] rather let them read it
[45:55] with your life
[45:58] don't just quote poor quote
[46:01] if you love somebody
[46:03] they can truly see that you love them
[46:06] it's not fake
[46:08] amen there is no love in the
[46:09] denominational world out there
[46:14] so people know when the bride of jesus
[46:15] christ is genuine
[46:17] amen and sometimes love may be
[46:19] corrective amen amen sometimes maybe we
[46:22] go too hard on them
[46:24] amen
[46:26] they feel like we're coming on too hard
[46:28] amen but what you're trying to do
[46:30] save their soul
[46:33] amen
[46:34] so he says
[46:36] follow his thought now the people who
[46:37] took his revelation from god that's got
[46:40] the book now in the hand become the
[46:42] living epistles
[46:44] read and known of all men for their
[46:46] generation
[46:50] what will they say of us when our time
[46:51] has come and it's time for us to go
[46:54] maybe not even in the rapture
[46:57] but when the lord calls us home
[46:59] what
