So we greet you all once again. Amen. And trust that everyone is doing well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And everyone is blessed in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

We have Sister Chan also with us this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our sister Matilda's mom, let's give her a hand and welcome her. No stranger to us. She was also baptized here a few years ago. Amen. So we pray that the Lord will continue to be with her even as she fellowships with us this morning. Amen. And then also our condolences to Pastor Denel, brother Pubalan Ariu. Amen. Passed on. He was 71 years old. He just turned 71 on Thursday. Then he passed on on Friday. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Lord determines our times and our seasons. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The thing is to be ready at all times and be prepared at all times. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, excuse me if I don't stay to fellowship with you after the service. I've got to rush off straight there because I'm preaching at that funeral service. Amen. So, I pray that it'll all be in order so you don't think I ignored you and I rushed away. Amen. I'm not avoiding you. I just got to go straight to Mia Bank and minister there. Amen. So, let's turn to the word of the Lord. Let's turn to Jeremiah 29:1. Praise the Lord. Jeremiah 29:1 says, "I know the thoughts &gt;&gt; that I think toward you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, other translations will say, "I know the plans." Amen. How God plans. I know the thoughts that I think toward you, say the Lord. Thoughts of peace and not of evil &gt;&gt; to give you an expected end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe in this life, we don't know where our lives are heading, but God knows exactly what our end is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know the thoughts that I think toward you, say the Lord, thoughts of peace, not of evil, to give you an expected end. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, how does God plan? You might ask. If he knows the plan for our lives, let's go to Isaiah 46 and verse 10 and see how God plans. Amen. Isaiah 46 and verse 10 says, "Declaring the end from the beginning." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, pay attention to that. God plans the end of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; First. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times, the things that are not yet done, saying, "My counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So God determines the end. Then he goes back to the beginning and he works his plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Calling a ravenous bird from the east, that the man that executed my counsel from a far country. Yay, I have spoken it. I will also bring it to pass. I have purposed it. I will also do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, whatever God purposes, whatever his plan is, he's going to bring it to pass. Amen. You may be seated. The Lord had blessings through the reading of his word. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll just lay these two more scriptures and we'll continue in Jeremiah 1 and verse 5. I don't have it there, brother. You'll pick it up. Amen. When you search it, God is telling the prophet, "Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee. [clears throat] And before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God has purpose for each and every one of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knew about our birth before we were formed in the belly of our mom. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before thy king was forth from the womb, I sanctified thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has sanctified each one of us for a purpose to fulfill a purpose on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE ALSO GIVES US WHEN GOD CALLS A MAN, he equips a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WHEN GOD ORDAINS A MAN, HE GIVES HIM the necessary tools in this life to make it through. And here he says, I have ordained THEE A PROPHET UNTO the nations. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we we know that under our message under Revelation 10:8-11, we are asked to prophesy again. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO GOD HAS ORDAINED US TO PROPHESY to nations. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In Romans 9:11, uh for the children not being yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose OF GOD ACCORDING TO ELECTION might stand. &gt;&gt; Not of works, but of him that calleth. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. DON'T LOOK AT ME FOR MY MISTAKES. &gt;&gt; DON'T LOOK AT ME FOR MY FAULTS. DON'T LOOK AT ME FOR MY WORKS. AMEN. I'M HERE TO FULFILL THE PURPOSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering] AMEN. &gt;&gt; Moses had his mistakes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T LOOK AT MOSES MISTAKES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PETER DENIED THE LORD THREE TIMES. GOD DIDN'T LOOK AT PETER'S MISTAKES. GOD LOOKED AT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH HE HAD DESIGNED THEIR LIVES FOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES. &gt;&gt; Because if you look at Peter, Peter denied THE LORD. &gt;&gt; BUT JUDAS BETRAYED THE LORD. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE BOTH FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because if YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DENIAL and betrayal, &gt;&gt; one denied, one betrayed. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BUT THEY BOTH WERE SERVING DIFFERENT PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; BUT THE PURPOSE OF GOD ACCORDING TO YOUR ELECTION will stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the children not yet born. I'm showing you how God plans &gt;&gt; before they are born. He planned he has a purpose for your life. Neither having done any good or evil. So God is not choosing based on good or evil. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; That the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth. It was said unto her, "The elders shall serve the younger. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." So don't get upset when God says he hates denomination. &gt;&gt; You say WHERE THE PROPHET TOLD US GOD HATES DENOMINATION. &gt;&gt; He hates the very idea of denominations. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So God HATES DENOMINATION BUT HE LOVES US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO HE CALLED US OUT OF EVERY DENOMINATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now the prophet of God says here God made a plan for man to be saved and man cannot add anything to that plan. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; It's God's plan. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So our GOD IS A GREAT BIG PLANNER. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "BUT LONG BEFORE TIME EVER BEGAN, this was all planned in the wisdom of God." And God ALL GOD ALWAYS HAS EVERYTHING JUST at the minute. &gt;&gt; Every minute of our lives IS DETAILED. &gt;&gt; WE MAY SAY WE ARE BORED. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH TIME. BUT GOD HAS DETERMINED EVERY MOMENT OF OUR TIME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We can choose to waste it or we can choose to serve the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet of God also says a son of God can go for years wandering around. &gt;&gt; Not fulfilling God's purpose. He says but if he's a son he will come back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now second Peter 1 and verse4 says this. Amen. whereby I given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, &gt;&gt; having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, notice, God is TELLING US, WE HAVE ALREADY ESCAPED. &gt;&gt; We have ALREADY ESCAPED THE CORRUPTION OF THE WORLD. But what's the point I want to get to? WE ARE PARTAKERS OF HIS DIVINE NATURE. YES. &gt;&gt; And I want TO SHOW YOU THIS MORNING A PART OF AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD'S divine nature is to plan. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we ever want to succeed IN ANYTHING IN LIFE, AMEN. There's got to be a plan. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God, a planning IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF GOD'S DIVINE NATURE. &gt;&gt; HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF HIS DIVINE NATURE IS TO HAVE A PLAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD PLANNED THE DEATH OF JESUS BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. THE LAMB WAS SLAIN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's just read some things that God did before the foundation of the world. Ephesians 1:4 says, "According as he had chosen us." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In him BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You mean before man fell, he chose us. &gt;&gt; That's how GOD CHOOSES US. GOD IS A PLANNER. &gt;&gt; God planned for success. &gt;&gt; God planned so these attributes can be made manifest. &gt;&gt; GOD PLANNED FOR YOU TO BE SITTING HERE THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; GOD CLEARED ALL THE OBSTACLES THAT WERE COMING IN YOUR WAY. ALL THE THOUGHTS THAT WERE COMING IN YOUR MIND. GOD CLEARED IT ALL. AMEN. AND MADE A WAY FOR YOU TO COME HERE THIS MORNING to hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So according as he had chosen us in him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; SO IF HE CHOSE ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, AMEN. I CAN'T FAIL. &gt;&gt; IF I FAIL, THE PURPOSE OF GOD FAILS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I WAS CHOSEN IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Satan may WANT TO TRIP ME UP. SATAN MAY WANT TO COME AGAINST ME. AMEN. But Satan is defeated. &gt;&gt; Christ has defeated him on the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. NOT ONLY HAS HE HAD CHOSEN US, BUT HE HAS ALREADY SAID THAT WE SHOULD BE HOLY AND WITHOUT BLAME before him in love. &gt;&gt; So I am blameless. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I AM HOLY BECAUSE I AM IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I BEAR NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR FALLEN MAN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; What fallen man? This nature is a sticky nature. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PRO PROPHET OF GOD SAYS YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS with a sticky NATURE IN THIS LIFE. AMEN. BECAUSE THE BODY, the flesh IS NOT REDEEMED, &gt;&gt; BUT OUR SOUL HAS BEEN REDEEMED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But we've got to STRENGTHEN THE INNER MAN. WE'VE GOT TO STRENGTHEN THE spirit man. Amen. Strengthen the soul. Amen. AND BRING THE FLESH UNDER SUBJECTION &gt;&gt; UNTIL WE ARE DELIVERED FROM THIS VILE OLD BODY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we are finding we were chosen in before the foundation of the world. We was he made us holy and without blame before him in love. Amen. uh here in John 17:24 he says, "Father, I will that they also whom thou has given me." &gt;&gt; He gave us to him before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; When God thought of Jesus CHRIST, HE THOUGHT OF HIM IN BOTH MASCULINE and feminine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because male and female created them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam and Eve was a mystery &gt;&gt; of Christ and his bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Thou whom thou has given me be with me where I am &gt;&gt; that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In 1 Peter 1 [clears throat] Peter 1:18, it says here verse 19, let's read 19. but with the precious blood of Jesus as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who was who verily was for him before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the lamb was without blemish. The lamb was without spot before the foundation of the world. One more portion of scripture in revelation 13:8 it says and they that dwell on the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. So we are learning two things from here. The lamb is slain from before the foundation of the world and their names written in the book from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God has a plan and is called the plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AMEN. SO GOD PLANNED THE DEATH OF JESUS FOR 4,000 years before Jesus came to earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that it was longer because we just read that he he planned his death from before the foundation of the world. But if we are counting, Amen. just time, it's 4,000 years. Before man fell, God planned. &gt;&gt; God plans when things doesn't seem necessary. Praise the Lord. Now I also got to say this here that we were created in the image and likeness of God &gt;&gt; and we ought to function like God &gt;&gt; we can't be living aimless lives and walking without a plan &gt;&gt; in the message. Amen. What it takes to overcome the prophet says our faith. Amen. He says that uh a beggar came to his home and knocked on the door and asked for some food and he told his wife to fix the man some food. Amen. So after she fixed him some food, he he got down and he started to talk to this man and he says, "Oh, where you coming from?" He says, "Oh, nowhere. Where you going to?" "Nowhere." "What's your plan in life?" "Oh, whatever comes." The prophet says we shouldn't be like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "IF GOD PUT US ON THE EARTH, HE PUT US HERE FOR A PURPOSE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We should be living our lives ACCORDING TO THE PLAN OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YES. ACCORDING TO THE PURPOSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If we start out right, we'll end right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we are finding THAT BEFORE MAN FELL, GOD PLANNED. &gt;&gt; God plans for things that don't seem necessary at the time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAN HAD NOT FALLEN when when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He hadn't even created MAN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD HE PLAN FOR THE FALL? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He plans for things, AMEN. THAT ARE UNEXPECTED. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God planned for our salvation before MAN WAS CREATED. CALVARY was planned IN ETERNITY. &gt;&gt; IT'S CALLED A PLAN OF REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD PLANS, HE PLANS IN DETAIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD'S PLANS ARE ELABORATE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. The prophet of God in things that are to be. He says, "Your birth," Amen. Paragraph 25, things that are to be. Your birth year was pre-planned. I guess you believe that. Every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned. &gt;&gt; Now, when he's talking about this pre-planned, HE'S NOT TALKING about your mother and father sitting and talking and saying, "We think we should have a son." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's talking about God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God pre-planned your birth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God pre-planned your coming on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you, brother Nathaniel. AMEN. GOD PRE-PLANNED THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE A MISTAKE. IN FACT, SOMETIMES MOTHERS AND FATHERS SAY, "YOU know what? You were a mistake. YOU ARE NOT A MISTAKE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. COME ON, BROTHER. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LIFE COMES FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU COMING HERE ON THE EARTH IS NOT A MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; YOU COMING HERE ON THE EARTH IS NOT BY CHANCE. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We know the atheists AND THESE PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD SAYS, "OH, NO. WE JUST EVOLVED." &gt;&gt; AMEN. They came here from monkeys. THEY SAY &gt;&gt; FROM CHIMPANZEES. PRAISE THE LORD. YOU KNOW THE story about the mother and father that were talking to the child and the child want to know where did we come from? &gt;&gt; And he goes to ask the mother where we came from and the the the mother says no you know God created us in his own image in his own likeness and God spoke us and he created us from the dust of the earth. And then he goes to the father and says dad where did we come from? The father says no we evolved from chimpanzees. So the child goes back to the mother and says, "Mom, dad says we came from chimpanzees." So the mom says, "No, he's talking about his side of the family." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But we are talking about our side this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That our birth was pre-planned. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Every one of you knows that our birth WAS PRE-PLANNED. SO DON'T LET anybody tell you that you are not good enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you have no purpose on the earth. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU HAVE A PURPOSE. GOD PRE-PLANNED YOUR LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Did you know that your being here never originated just and a myth or a thought? Everything was pre-planned by God. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation OF THE WORLD, THAT YOU WOULD BE HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I also WANT TO SAY GOD COULD HAVE PRE-PLANNED FOR YOU TO BE IN the age of Paul. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He could have allowed YOU TO BE FED to lions &gt;&gt; to be se. Amen. But God had PRE-PLANNED AND HE CHOSE YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR GENE SEED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT YOU CAN WITHSTAND DECEPTION. &gt;&gt; YOUR CHAIN SEED WON'T ALLOW YOU TO BE DECEIVED in this season. &gt;&gt; Your gene seed is what? TO RECEIVE THE PROPHETIC WORD OF THIS HOUR. &gt;&gt; TO RECEIVE MALACHI 4, TO RECEIVE REVELATION 10:7. AMEN. YOUR GENE SEED WAS GENETICALLY CODED TO RECEIVE THIS WORD OF THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. LUTHER'S GENE SEED WAS NOT GENETICALLY DESIGNED to receive the full open word. HE HAD ONE PART OF HIS WORD AND HIS GEN WAS GENETICALLY CODED TO RECEIVE JUSTIFICATION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WESLEY WAS AMEN CODED TO RECEIVE JUSTIFICATION AND SANCTIFICATION. THE EARLY PENTECOSTALS, AMEN, WAS DESIGNED TO RECEIVE THE RESTORATION OF THE GIFTS. BUT THIS IS NO ORDINARY TIME SEASON. GOD HAS A SUPERASS OF PEOPLE ON THE EARTH RIGHT NOW. GOD HAS A SUPER RACE ON THE EARTH RIGHT NOW. THIS SUPER RACE IS GENETICALLY CODED, AMEN, to withstand SATAN'S SCHEMES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WILL NOT BE LIKE EVE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE STAND FOR THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HE STAND FOR THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, SOMEBODY GIVE GOD PRAISE IN HIS PLACE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GLORY, GLORY, GLORY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD THAT I WAS PRE-PLANNED by God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The infinite God knew. And to be infinite, he had to know every flea that was ever be on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, God has a plan. In the prophecies in the oneness of unity, God has a plan and the devil has a plan. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Now we are seeing a counter plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the devil IS TRYING TO GET ALL PEOPLE UNDER HIS PLAN WHILE GOD IS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO BE UNDER HIS PLAN. &gt;&gt; SO I ASK YOU, WHOSE PLAN ARE YOU FOLLOWING THIS MORNING? &gt;&gt; JESUS. &gt;&gt; There's a straight way and there's a NAR AMEN. THERE'S A BROAD WAY and a narrow way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BUT WATCH, THERE ARE TWO FORCES PULLING YOU. ONE WANTS TO PULL YOU to the devil's plan. One who wants to pull you TO GOD'S PLAN. I'M ASKING YOU WHOSE PLAN ARE YOU FOLLOWING? &gt;&gt; Some people say, you know, God's plan is here on the left, on the right. God's Satan's plan is on the left. I want to stay in middle of the road. &gt;&gt; So, they got one foot on God's plan, one foot in Satan's plan. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And they're trying to say, "I'm staying middle of the road." No. You know the prophet of God says he was they were talking about this man and and the the trail that was going up to the mountain. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Any of you know that story? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says, "Amen, that they speak spoke to this people that were going to drive this cab up the mountain and it was narrow crevices and pathway." And the one says, "No me, I go very fast. I go and you know I maneuver. I'm skilled in these things here." And the other one says, "No, I go as close as possible to the edge. I give you a thrill." And then he came found an older man there and he says, "No, I don't know if I'm the right one for you. Me, I go very slow and I stay as far away from that curb as possible, the edge." He says, "You're the man for the job." &gt;&gt; We want to stay away from the devil's plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't want one foot in the world and one foot in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus even when he's reprimanding this age, the seven church age, he says, I would THAT THEY WERE HOT OR COLD, &gt;&gt; but I hate lukewarmness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says here, God has a plan. The devil has a plan. The devil is trying to get all people under his plan while God is trying to get people under his plan. So there's two great spirits in the world. One of them is the devil. The other is God. The devil has messengers. God has messengers. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we had liberty to make our choice. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To whom will we y heal ourselves to? That's whose servants we are. You know, we are the some choice. We are the some the person of ourselves is based on our choices. &gt;&gt; Everything in life. But I want you to know that your present is not your past. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Your present circumstance right now. &gt;&gt; You can't base it on your past. That's right. &gt;&gt; Whatever you went through in your past, cut it off. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Don't allow the past to determine your your present. &gt;&gt; So, whatever you went through IN YOUR PAST, YOUR HURTS, PEOPLE BEING AGAINST YOU, WHATEVER TRAUMA YOU FACE IN THIS LIFE, WHEN YOU ARE IN CHRIST, YOU CAN'T CARRY THOSE THINGS INTO a Christian life. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BASE YOUR WALK BASED ON THOSE PAST HURTS, THOSE PAST FEELINGS, AND WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PAST. YOU CAN'T BE DRIVING FORWARD BY LOOKING IN THE REAR REVIEW MIRROR. COME ON, PEOPLE OF GOD. GOD HAS MADE US PEOPLE OF VISION, PEOPLE OF PURPOSE ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; Do you know people can't get past relationships, can't get past traumas, their father did them THIS, THEIR CHILDREN, THEIR DAUGHTERS DID them this. Amen. Their mother did them this. And and if you go and talk to most uh people that's having problems in this life, you go and see you talk to people and psychologists have spoken to people that uh give themselves over to prostitution and and all of these things, they trace it back to a trauma in their childhood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All these women that's into pornography and all of these things. &gt;&gt; Somewhere along the line, they were abused as a child. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And these things carry this trauma carries into them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and even like uh children's their upbringing if you find you find a a child doesn't recover from the fact if their mother and father gave them away when they come of age and they realize they were adopted they go on a search to find their parents. &gt;&gt; They want to know their origins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they are never satisfied. Some of them they may have stayed with their parents for 20 years but they reject those parents. &gt;&gt; Trauma Amen. People carrying things in their heart. As we go along, you'll see what the prophet is saying now. So remember, if you are being drawn away from the presence of God, you are being witnessed by messengers. What is the prophet saying? The devil has &gt;&gt; So who can tell me now it's the plan of God for you to miss church? &gt;&gt; Please raise your hand. &gt;&gt; It's God's plan for you to miss church. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So then whose plan are we following &gt;&gt; because God's plan says forsake not the assembling together of yourselves even as you see the day fast approaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to move quickly here now. Amen. So when you are when you are planning when you have a plan and a desire to serve God and the things of God, remember your first plan should be to seek the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Before you plan for a wife, for a husband, before you plan for a job, before you plan for anything else, the Bible says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT SHOULD BE OUR FIRST PLAN. &gt;&gt; I I don't care about any other thing, Lord. I want to pursue your plan, the kingdom of God. I need the Holy Ghost. That should be the first plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that that's how the kingdom operates. We go trying to pursue the material things first. But God says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and I'll add other things." &gt;&gt; It comes automatically. I'll add this and I'll add this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just prior to that, he's talking about clothing and food and all of these things. He says, "But if you seek the kingdom of God, I'll add the other things automatically." &gt;&gt; When we are in his kingdom, we become his responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can't be saying, "My father owns a cattle on a thousand hill, but yet we are starving." &gt;&gt; What cattle? Why you don't kill the cattle and eat it? But we are saying, "My father owns a cattle on a thousand hill." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to know how to operate in the kingdom of God. I didn't read in the Bible where Abraham was starving. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Somebody walk with me. &gt;&gt; God blessed Abraham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we are plann to plan is to have an attribute of God. &gt;&gt; If I come and ask you what's the plan for your life and if you got no plan for your life then something is wrong. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you have no plan, the Bible says where there is no vision, the people perish. &gt;&gt; What is your vision? The Bible also says in Abac, write the vision. &gt;&gt; Make it plain. &gt;&gt; Let me see your vision. Let me see your plan. &gt;&gt; Where are you heading to? I'm talking not just spiritual now. Even though we are focusing on spiritual, I'm trying to bring it down in a broader sense to show you in your natural life, what is your plan? How come you can plan for other things in your life, but you can't plan for the things of God? &gt;&gt; When you come of age, the first thing you want to do when you turn 16, what's the legal age to get learners now? 16 &gt;&gt; 18 16 first thing you know very quickly you go a plan now to get the learners. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible says or the prophet of God says age of accountability is 12. &gt;&gt; Right? So you bypass that planning stage. Now you've gone to 16. So now you want learners without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You bypassed the first step which was seeking first the kingdom. &gt;&gt; And now you want learners. Then you became 18. You want driver's license. &gt;&gt; You want to get all of these things without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So which means our building plan is disfigured. We are not building the foundation. Right. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God also says we build according to a plan. How many of you know it's illegal to build without a plan? &gt;&gt; How many of you know the prophet of God says the natural types are spiritual? &gt;&gt; It's illegal to build without a plan. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS OUR PLAN? WHAT IS OUR PURPOSE? You know, we've been preaching things here and and I I don't know if you've been receiving it or not, but I tell you, lives are changing. &gt;&gt; People's lives are being transformed. &gt;&gt; We are getting testimonies. Amen. From even beyond the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll share this very quick testimony. We don't have time to play it for you. How many of you know brother stringy was in this church? &gt;&gt; How many of you know him? &gt;&gt; You remember him? So on the Monday they were fasting and praying. They asked me to come preach there and I preached certain things and the brother is giving a testimony just a week later. The brother was blacklisted. 70,000 rand in debt. You know when you get blacklisted you can't get &gt;&gt; financed. How many of you know that? &gt;&gt; If you're black, listen, I'm giving you this testimony for a reason. If you are blacklisted, God can bypass procedures. &gt;&gt; And I started to speak to them about how God can bypass procedures and how God Amen. Uh speaking about Jabz and how he bypassed procedures of asking the elders, he went straight to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God granted him everything that he had desired. &gt;&gt; And I spoke about Samad and how that building was tied up in legal work. But the prophet prayed &gt;&gt; and the brother Sam and dear phon the prophet to say I don't know what happened but all the the the legal work came right and I'm now the owner of this building. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh you know I was preaching that week on faith and I was telling him ask God for big things like the prophet says ask him for big things. He can do big things for you as much as he can do small things. And he says, you know, they they were driving a little car and they were all squashed up in the car and he's got big children. And he said, Lord, there's one thing I need is a vehicle. And he said he had a desire. He says by the Thursday, he was looking at some vehicle. And they phoned him on Friday. And they phoned him and to ask him, you know, are you going to be paying for this cash or you going to be paying finance? He says, I don't have the cash and I can't apply for finance because I'm blacklisted. He got blacklisted in 2023. So, you know, in 2025, it's not possible. You'll be on ITC. You'll be on every bank record. I know because I work with vehicle finance. So, if you don't, you don't know and you don't want to believe me, believe me. I'm telling you, we know all these cases. They apply for finance every day. They're blacklisted. Amen. ITC, debt counseling, debt review, and all of these things. So, [clears throat] the the sales lady tells him, you know, why don't you apply for finance? And he says, I can't apply for finance. I'm blacklisted. She kind of convinced him. He said just apply anyway. &gt;&gt; He applies on that Friday. He says within minutes he got a message back to say his finance is approved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God can bypass procedures. &gt;&gt; What What did Jesus say in Mark 9:23? Do you know what Jesus said in Mark 9:23? Praise the Lord. All things, &gt;&gt; some things. &gt;&gt; You see, we put limitation on the all things. All things are possible to him that believeth. &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. &gt;&gt; You say, "No, I'm too old. I'm too this." All things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it's according to what you believe. Jesus many times prayed for. He didn't pray for them. They came to him and he says according to your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; According to your faith. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God can bypass procedures even in your own life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No matter if there's legal work or whatever it is, God can bypass procedures. We are serving the King of Kings and God is not governed by earthly standards and man-made laws. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God is determined for you to have something, he can bypass procedures and make you have it. Praise the Lord. But we've got to recognize that we are children of his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Now, I know some of you don't like this. Some of you don't like this kind of preaching. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of you saying, you know, bro, you know, there's a fine line there. I don't know what line you see. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Why don't we believe the word of God? [screaming] &gt;&gt; Jesus even said, "You have not because you Jesus said, "You have not because you &gt;&gt; not &gt;&gt; ask not." Praise the Lord. So tell your neighbor a shame for you because my father says I must ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and don't get upset and jealous and upset now that this brother is only being blessed. &gt;&gt; They're asking. &gt;&gt; We are heirs of the father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Joints with the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we have 50/50 bank account, it's not my problem if I'm drawing more money than you. &gt;&gt; We got 50/50 joint account. &gt;&gt; I got a card. You got a card. The prophet says when we were saved, born again, God wrote checks out and he signed it &gt;&gt; and he gave it to us. &gt;&gt; Now we're going to keep. Hey, you know me, I like auto. See, Jesus signed his signature here. If I write here and I cash it in, I won't have that signature. &gt;&gt; We are collectors. &gt;&gt; We collect signatures. &gt;&gt; But there's one person cashing it. &gt;&gt; Cashing it. &gt;&gt; He even cashed all his checks. He's saying, "Hey, bro, you're not using that check. Let me cash your check, too." [laughter] So other people are living off your blessings because you are poor. You say that's not possible. I tell you it's possible. Come on, put up Matthew 25. Then Jesus gave them equal amount of checks. I can show you scripture for this. Jesus gave them talents. &gt;&gt; One, one invested the talent. &gt;&gt; He spent it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The other two. Amen. Now watch. These things also come by ability. Don't think that all of us will be millionaires. Yeah. All of us. It comes by ability. Listen to what the Lord says here. &gt;&gt; He gave them talents. One five. So you can't get jealous to say why you gave that one five &gt;&gt; and me too. and another one to every man according to his several ability. &gt;&gt; So the key in the kingdom is to show God you can handle what he has given you then he will multiply it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Are we reading the Bible here? &gt;&gt; So he's [laughter] giving every man according to his several ability. So not everyone will be millionaires. &gt;&gt; Not everyone will be that level but according to what you can handle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what you can handle and what will turn your heart away from him. &gt;&gt; Yes. The thing is, you got to show him you're a good steward and you can manage it wisely. &gt;&gt; Now, if you've mismanaged finances, you need to rebuild his trust. &gt;&gt; But here, I'm trying to show you that God is giving out and then if you go up there, you'll see that the one that took the talent and hid it in the ground, the check, hid it in the ground. God didn't have kind words for him. Let's move down there to that last way he's talking about it. Amen. The other two, he multiplied what they had. Amen. But the one that hid it in the ground, he says, "Thou wicked." &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the last guy. THOU WICKED AND SLUTFUL SERVANT. THOU KNEW I reap where I sowed not and gather where I've not saw. What must you do to him? Bind him. &gt;&gt; You ought to put your money to the exchanges. And at my coming I should have received my own with usery. &gt;&gt; Therefore, take the talent from him, give him to the one that had 10. &gt;&gt; Sure. And everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance, but from him that hath not shall be taken away, even that which he had. God, don't leave him there now. Come, let's tie him up and bind him now. Cast his unprofitable servant in the outer darkness. There shall be weeping, nashing of teeth. &gt;&gt; So don't think God is feeling, hey, this guy here, he kept what I gave him. What have you done with what's been given to you? &gt;&gt; God wants to see multiplication in his kingdom. &gt;&gt; God's kingdom works by multiplication and addition. Satan's kingdom works by division and subtraction. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So our plan is to follow God's word which will lead you to ultimate success. And we can be prosperous in this life. Spiritual prosperity first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody say spiritual prosperity first. &gt;&gt; Spiritual prosperity first. &gt;&gt; Because God wants his children to prosper. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now your dream will always remain a dream as long as there's no plan attached to it. Some people dream their whole life. They dreaming of this and they dreaming of this and they dreaming of that. Praise the Lord. But there's no plan ATTACHED TO IT. GOD HAD THOUGHTS IN THE BACK PART OF HIS MIND. WE are thought in Christ the mystery of God revealed. But as long as it remain thoughts, nothing happened. &gt;&gt; There had to BE A PLAN ATTACHED TO GOD'S THOUGHTS. AND IT'S CALLED THE PLAN OF REDEMPTION. GOD THOUGHT ABOUT LIGHT. BUT AS LONG AS HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND DID NOTHING ABOUT IT, nothing happened. So you CAN HAVE GOOD THOUGHTS ALL YOU WANT. YOU CAN HAVE GOOD THOUGHTS, GOOD PLANS AND LEAVE it as a thought form. Nothing will happen. Nothing happened in Genesis until God stood there. The prophet says on that banister and he spoke and SAID LET THERE BE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. We are coming back to the time now the prophet says where the spoken word he calls it the original seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spoken word has been given back to us sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So don't let your thoughts your dreams be there just thoughts and dreams without a plan attached to it. Your thoughts will remain thoughts until it is spoken. Your words will remain unfulfilled until you believe your own words and don't doubt but believe that what you have said you shall receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God also tells us that hope remains hope until faith brings it to reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says many people think they got faith but they really have his hope. &gt;&gt; Hope is like a dream, a thought, a desire. Amen. You want that thing but he says faith goes into that unseen realm and pulls it into reality. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So yeah, uh do we have the scripture for this? Amen. I think it's Ecclesiastes. Hallelujah. We'll find it now. Amen. But the Bible is talking about time and chance. What makes the person who is successful in Christ different from you or from the person that's not successful? Each one is given time 24 hours in a day. All of us are given the same. So we can't say that we are given an unfair advantage. I'm only given 12 hours in the day. That person is given 24 hours. All of us have 24 hours in a day. &gt;&gt; What are we doing with that 24 hours in a day? That is the difference. Amen. Praise the Lord. So the secret to that is managing. He says there's two things you can't change is time and change. Amen. We've got to manage change. We've got to plan for change. God plan for change. You can't go to God and say, "God, help me." God help me with his plan. Amen. Uh I need help. God's going to ask you with what do you need help? Uh I want money for what? I don't have time to read all of the quotes, but I'm just trying to go through this very quickly. [clears throat] The prophet of God says you want to be healed. Tell him why you want to be healed. &gt;&gt; Tell him why you want to be healed. Why you want to be healed? You just want to carry on living your life, doing your own thing. Tell him why you want to be healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You that read the message, you'll know what I'm talking about. Amen. You need money for what? Do you need money? Lord, lead me and guide me where? Where must he lead you? &gt;&gt; David was very specific. Lead me down paths of righteousness. &gt;&gt; We just pray prayers like, "Lord, won't you lead me and guide me?" Where where do you want to be led in paths of righteousness? In parts of holiness. Where do you want to be led? Be specific. If you give him no destination, Amen. You got no goal or no purpose in life. So, plan your time. Plan your days. Amen. Line your problems in the sight of God's word. You know, when you're firing a gun, you've got to line the sight. Take your problems and line it with the sight of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Line it with the sight of God's word. And when you get a clear shot, pull the trigger. &gt;&gt; Pull the trigger on your problem based on God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what will make you different from everyone else is you are able to manage time and change. When time and season change for Moses, God managed time and change. Amen. For the children of Israel, God sent Moses there. God had already planned for their deliverance. I told you God is a planner. When when the world was in going into chaos and God was displeased with man, God had time and God knew how to manage time and change. And he he had a plan for the ark. Praise the Lord. So plan with purpose because every plan must accomplish a purpose. &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve fell in the garden of Eden, but God came immediately and presented a plan. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's move on now. So God, I'm going to reiterate this. God is a planner. We were created in his image. What is our plan? Don't waste time. You know, some of us only have one summer left. So, think of it this way. In [clears throat] the period of time, according to the Bible, it is appointed unto man three score and 10. &gt;&gt; That is how many years? &gt;&gt; 70 years. Which means you'll have 70 summers, 70 winters, 70 autumns, and 70 springs. Hello. So if we are to count down the amount of summers and springs, some of us have five springs left, five summers left, some of us have one summer left, some of us have one week left, some of us have one day left. We don't know. Nobody knows. Everyone's getting scared now. Maybe we got one more spring. We don't know. But have we made preparation? &gt;&gt; Have we planned? Have we accepted the Lord Jesus Christ? Do we believe on him? He says, "If you believe on me, you shall have everlasting life." &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Another thing, don't waste time. Have an APPRECIATION FOR LIFE. GOD GAVE US this life. Some of us are so unhappy and upset that we are alive. You go around telling you, "I wish I was dead." How many of you heard people speak like that? &gt;&gt; They're so unappreciative of life. BUT GOD GAVE US HIS BREATH. &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE US GOOD BODIES. &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE US GOOD HEALTH. WE ARE TO ENJOY LIFE. WE ARE TO BE HAPPY ABOUT LIFE. WE SHOULD HAVE JOY IN OUR SOULS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HEY, come on now. You know, I want to say something, but you're going to get offended. Message people should not be miserable people. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We should be happy. &gt;&gt; WE SAY WE HAVE THE MOST GLORIOUS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But we walking around with silent faces. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How you expect other people to come accept your message when they see you got no joy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can say I'm happy [clears throat] where I am. You look like you never had joy in your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; You got to make them thirsty. &gt;&gt; Let me say it this way. Don't be a grouch. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't always complain. &gt;&gt; Complain about everyone. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, everyone you like, you know, people don't have encyclopedia anymore, but you're a walking encyclopedia. You ask him about this brother. Hey, suddenly he start ratting. Hey, like fire. What's that called that gun? &gt;&gt; AK-47. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I told you we need to be one another's gatekeeper. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you hear your husband and your wife and your children talk like that, you need to tell them, "Come on, let's change our talk." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't we born again? &gt;&gt; Aren't we Holy Ghost filled? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why you carrying? Do you know out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks? &gt;&gt; You know how they start? Hey bro, you know me, I got nothing against them, mate. But then they tell you all those things. Come on, am I talking? &gt;&gt; You know me, I got nothing. I don't hold nothing against anyone, bro. But now they start tell you all of these things. And then out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. So even though they are telling you they got nothing, the heart is telling everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you're looking through the eyes of God, you can see them as sinless, as blameless, spotless, without wrinkle. &gt;&gt; I'll say amen to that. &gt;&gt; We don't HAVE A NEGATIVE GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT A POSITIVE GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord. Some people are never thankful, always anxious, always worrying, always sulking. Everyone was sto around there. Praise the Lord. Because your feelings get hurt. But Jesus feelings, he was despised and rejected of men. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are not raising pot plant Christians here. &gt;&gt; Hotb Christians. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So once in a while, God going to allow the brother to step on your toes &gt;&gt; to see what's inside. &gt;&gt; If you want orange juice, what you must do to the orange? Squeeze it. &gt;&gt; You must squeeze it. &gt;&gt; If I want to see what's inside of you, no matter what you profess with your mouth, let me step on your toes. &gt;&gt; And then I want to see. Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me. &gt;&gt; Sorry, brother. I'm sure you didn't mean to step on my toes, but it's okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're not raising What about people? Do they have a good testimony about us? What will our children say about us if they're not lying? What will our children say about us? If you're not married, what will your brother and sister say about you? If they're not covering up for your children cover up for their parents, will they have a good testimony to say, "No matter what my mother and father went through, no matter what my brother and sister went through, they never stopped serving the Lord." They were always faithful. &gt;&gt; No matter what sickness, what disease, what hardship, what struggles, they always put God first. &gt;&gt; THEY NEVER MISS CHURCH. THEY WERE FAITHFUL. But some people buckle under the slightest pressure. They give up victim mentality. How can we have victim mentality when we're supposed to be new creation? carrying baggage from the old man, old nature, living life in the kingdom of God with scars from the past. Amen. If we are new creation, he gives us a new nature. And that nature comes from the Holy Ghost. But people don't want the Holy Ghost. Amen. Let's read in Proverbs chapter 16 and verse 9. Amen. We're almost done now. We can try and wind this up. It says within your heart you can make plans for your future but the Lord chooses the steps you take to get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think this is just another translation but if you find the original translation you'll say a man makes plans in his heart but the Lord determines his steps he takes. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:9. So this is just with your heart. You can make plans for your future but the Lord chooses the steps you take to get there. Amen. Even Romans 8:28 says, "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them which are called according to his purpose." Now, can we plan for success? Let's see what the Lord told Joshua. Joshua 18, even as we try and wind down now, he says, "The book of the Lord shall not depart from your mouth. Thou shalt meditate there in day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein, for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, then thou shalt have good success." So, this is the key. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's break it down. How to be prosperous and have a good success. Keep the word in your mouth according to the scripture. NOW, WHAT MUST WE DO? KEEP THE WORD in our mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's get to the next part there. Amen. Next slide. Amen. The next one. Keep the word in your mouth. Next, he told Joshua, meditate on the word. To meditate means to be deliberate about it, to ponder upon it, think consistently on it. Do whatever the word says do. Amen. So to keep the word, meditate on the word, and do what the word says do. That's the recipe for good success. &gt;&gt; And James 1:22 says, "Be doers of the word, &gt;&gt; not hearers only." Praise the Lord. Now we can also cut ourselves from blessing by the way we treat people. Here the prophet of says they hated him without a cause because he was spiritual. Talking of Joseph now &gt;&gt; he was born as here. They had visions, dreams, interpret. He was more spiritual than the rest of his brothers. They hated him without a cause. They ought to have loved him more because the first that God was with him. You just do favor for those that God is with. Okay, let's read this properly now because this is the key I want to give you. He says, you just do favor for those that God is with and watch how you prosper. &gt;&gt; Everyone hearing that? If you know that this is your brother and sister and he's walking with God, if you do them a favor, he says, "Watch how you prosper." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many of you are reading that? You just do favor for those that God is with and watch how you prosper. God is always with his son Jesus Christ. You know that. So just do him favor and see how you prosper. Praise the Lord. This is the message the angel of the covenant. Amen. Preach 54031. Now is it in the Bible that you can prosper? Yes. 3 John 1 and 2. Amen. Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in good health, even as thy soul prosperth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So it's based on pro prosperity of the soul first. &gt;&gt; As your soul is prospering, I want you to prosper in all things and to be in good health. [crying] Now the prophet now hears, you know, some people believe they're meant to be sick. Do you hear people know maybe it's my lot, bro? You know, in this life to be sick, you know, maybe it's my lot in this life to be poor. Maybe it's my lot in this life. Hello. &gt;&gt; Is anyone hearing me all sleeping now? &gt;&gt; I still got time here with you. &gt;&gt; I haven't clocked out yet. It's only 20 11. Praise the Lord. So pay attention. If you didn't sleep last night, take a deep breath. Get oxygen to your brain right now and let's close the service off. Some people believe it's their lot. Come on. Some people believe they made up their own story. This is meant for me. They told themselves that. But when you go to God's word, it's telling you something else. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here the prophet says, "Now I've heard many people take that ARGUMENT AND SAY, "OH, IT'S SUCH A BLESSED THING TO BE SICK." &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE SAY, "I'M SO BLESSED TO BE POOR." How can you be blessed to be poor? How can you be blessed to be sick? &gt;&gt; And we say we are children of Abraham. If if father Abraham was looking at you now, he say, "Hi, N boy. What happened to you? I was so blessed. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be after my royal seed. &gt;&gt; Now you are 10 boy." Because you revelation 10 boy. Took a while with Josh. Okay. So some people are saying it's such a blessed THING TO BE SICK. GOD USES IT TO BLESS US. How can it be a bless and a cursing at the same time? Praise the Lord. Amen. One time in South Oh, got to be South Africa prophet. I wonder if that's you know spirits don't die. I wonder if this is a South African spirit. One time in South Africa we were having a meeting at the Dutch Reform Church. He stood up first papers blasted everywhere. But when they found out that their members became so spiritual when they went back they'd holler amen in church and everything they thought that then he got fanatical. So he went to church and he talked about such a blessing how the Lord blessed people with sickness and the man's wife a couple of late days later had appendicitis rushed to the hospital and cut that blessing out. So it was a blessing. But then now when it was life-threatening, they will cut the blessing out. Why? Yes. If it's such a blessing to be sick, let her go ahead and be sick. Don't do nothing about it. You'd be doing something God wouldn't want you to do. If it's such a blessing to have cancer, why take radium or radiation or anything? Just let it go ahead and be a blessing. How many of you feel it's a blessing? Anything negative is supposed to be counted with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Look at all Jehovah's redemptive names. &gt;&gt; He takes care of everything. &gt;&gt; If you're sick is Rafa. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you need provision is Gyra. &gt;&gt; The redemptive blessings are there, but we are the ones saying no, it's not meant for me. &gt;&gt; We are the ones saying it's not meant for me. [clears throat] If we are troubled in our mind, you know, life circumstances can really weigh on us sometimes and it can come back to us memory and it can come. But we need shalom. &gt;&gt; We need peace. &gt;&gt; So is JEHOVAH SHALOM. THAT'S PART OF THE REDEMPTIVE BLESSING. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you're more blessed when you're dead, hear what the prophet says. Now, IF YOU'RE MORE BLESSED WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, AND YOU CAN DO NO more for the Lord when you're dead than when you're alive, well, go ahead and die. &gt;&gt; Let me give them the message because people going to say, I wrote this in the hand of the Lord came upon him 54043. So in other words, the prophet is saying is if you are no good alive and you're making everyone's life a misery and you yourself are not happy with your own life, he said then you might as well not go die because you are not fulfilling any purpose on the earth. Let's read that again. Some people can't believe the prophet said they must die. If you're more blessed when you're dead and [clears throat] you can do more for the Lord when you're dead than when you're alive, well go ahead and die. I can't believe the prophet said this, but anyway, let's move on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's miss the next one. And he's trying to force his way into you. Everything he can. Ask abundantly that your joys might be full. He wants his people to BE HAPPY. &gt;&gt; ASKING GREAT THINGS, BELIEVING for great things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know me, bro, I like to be unhappy. He He He wants HIS PEOPLE TO BE HAPPY ASKING FOR GREAT THINGS, believing for great things. That's thou son of David, have mercy on me. Amen. You know what? Some people in vain do they worship him. Yeah, that's Mark 7:7, right? In vain they are sick. They thinking they're sick for the Lord. In vain you are sick. Some people are poor for nothing. in vain you are poor. You're just lazy. Hello. Go read Ecclesiastes. He says if you don't do something, you're not going to get prosperous. You need to put your hands to work. When God created man, he said he must work. Before God gave man a wife, he planted the garden and said work in the garden first. Hello. &gt;&gt; I'm just checking if you're alive. That's why I'm saying hello. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's miss the next one and go to the next one in why the message why we're closing now. It's 11:23 now. You know what to do. &gt;&gt; How many of you know what to do? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's 11:23. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you believe in your heart, don't doubt, &gt;&gt; but believe that what you have spoken shall come to pass. You shall have what you said. You were made to be happy and free. &gt;&gt; You were made to live like children before your father and know that he makes every day everything work right for you each day. The people are just afraid of the new birth. This is what I keep saying. People hate the Holy Ghost. They're afraid to come to it because it'll straighten them up. It'll make you quit playing bingo, playing slot machines. Now, people don't have bingo and slot machine. They got their cell phone in their room and they they're gambling there. &gt;&gt; They're betting on soccer, &gt;&gt; sports betting, this that they're getting poor in their room. Yeah, before your parents said don't go out. Now in their not going out in their room and they're getting poor. &gt;&gt; Your parents should tell it before. Don't go out and join bad company. Now in the room they're joining bad company. &gt;&gt; Don't go out and mess with women. Now in the room they're messing with women. Pornographic material. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we talking truth? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's 21st century. We got to talk truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. People afraid that if it'll make you quit playing bingo, quit playing these slot machines. Praise the Lord. It'll make you quit staying at home on Wednesday night from prayer meeting to watch we love Suzie and all those other crazy things that Hollywood has got. Them dirty jokes that cracked over and it'll make you let your hair grow out long. It'll make you act like a lady. Make you quit smoking cigarettes than being in church as deacon. See, instead of doing that, rather be a deacon in the church. It'll make you quit lying, stealing. It'll do something for you. It'll clean you up, give you salvation that there's nothing in the world can explain it away from you cuz you know you were there when it happened. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And if you notice, listen to this very carefully now. When you get discouraged, that's when the devil can really pour it on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get discouraged, people. Be encouraged in the Lord. &gt;&gt; When you get discouraged, that's when THE DEVIL CAN REALLY POUR it on you. That's when he gets you. If you can come to church and say, "Well, I don't know. I don't know whether I'll ever get better or not. I've been prayed for twice. Oh my. You might as well go home." See, the prophet finished saying he was going to die. Now he's saying he must go home. &gt;&gt; You might as well go home. That's all. But when you can cast that aside, God don't want you to be frowning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God planned for you to be healed. Yes. &gt;&gt; God planned for you to prosper in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has planned for it. &gt;&gt; We've got to align to God's plan. &gt;&gt; As Gyra, he has planned for it. As Rafa, he has planned for it. &gt;&gt; God wants you to be happy. THE HUMAN HEART WAS MADE TO BE HAPPY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Worry will cause cancer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tempo will cause cancer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't never be upset. JUST WALK IN HIS LOVE. &gt;&gt; And when you're walking in him, nothing can harm you. There's nothing can harm you. Neither powers, present, things, future can separate us from him. Amen. Praise the Lord. We're chosen and elected in him. So, what kind of a power have you got over you to take care of you? You see, we have a power. I'm walking in power, working miracles, and live a life of favor. I know who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "What power have you got? The old powers that created the universe that took the solar system blew it like that every star went into place. Isaiah 54:17 says, "No weapon formed against thee shall prosper." Amen. And every time that shall rise against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn. There's nothing they there's really nothing you can say against them, but they're just alert, watching, seeing what's going on and watching. So he's talking about now how every country is watching one another and they'll slip into the one another's country and see what weapons you got. Right? So we already know I'm climaxing with this. We why I've got this quote here. They spy on one another to know what weaponry they have to uncover one another's defense weapons. Christ came now to open the seals to uncover Satan's tactics and his schemes. That's why the seals were open to make us victorious over the enemy so that we won't be deceived. &gt;&gt; So he he opened the seals to uncover the right of deception. Be like Daniel. [clears throat] Daniel burnt all the bridges behind it. &gt;&gt; When they say don't pray, you pray. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Daniel could have prayed without opening the curtains. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. But he wanted them to see that he was not afraid. &gt;&gt; So he says he wasn't planning on going back. So he burnt the bridges. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you don't want to burn bridges with the devil. &gt;&gt; You're telling me this thing here in the church, don't walk out. Wait, I'm coming back. &gt;&gt; You tell everyone in the bar, hey, keep my stool here. I'm coming back. No. Burn your bridges. &gt;&gt; Daniel didn't care if he burnt his bridges. He wasn't planning on going back. Why? He had a plan. He wasn't planning on going back. He wasn't watching his back trail, forsaking those things which are in the past. He pressed forward. Amen. Hear now. Have a plan. The prophet says when you're getting married, have a plan. Don't just go get married to anyone. He says a believer should never marry an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; It's a serious thing when you choose a wife for a man for the vows until death do we part. That's how we should keep it. And you take a vow before God that only death will separate you. A man in his right mind that's planning a future. What we must do? Plan. Don't go fall in love. Hello. Planning a future. You should choose a wife very carefully. Be careful what you're doing. And a woman choosing a husband or accepting the choice of a husband should be really careful what she's doing. Especially in these days, a man should think, pray before he chooses a wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you must do? Think. Now, when you're in love, nobody can think for you. You think you know everything. Hello. Don't look down now. Come on. Walk with me. I'm helping you here. &gt;&gt; You must think. You must pray. Don't only look. You know, you know I can look in your eyes forever. So you must close your eyes and pray. The prophet must pray. You know out of your eyes are the stars coming out. Your neck is like a swan. Start quoting Solomon to praise the Lord. Think. Pray before he chooses a wife. So many divorce cases now that we leave the world in America. Divorce cases we leave the rest of the world. There's more divorces here than anywhere else. This nation supposed to be thought of a Christian nation. What a reproach. Our divorce courses. Reason of it because that men has got away from God and woman has got away from God. And we find if a man prayed and a woman prayed over the matter, not just look at a pretty set of eyes, big strong shoulders, some worldly affection, but would look God first and say, "God, is that your plan?" &gt;&gt; Planning is an attribute of God. &gt;&gt; Is that your plan? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, in Proverbs 4:23 it says, "Amen." Let's get to Proverbs. Let's read the next one there. Keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life. All your problems are coming because of what's in your heart. You got scarred, you got memories, everything that's in your heart. He's saying out of it is the issues of life. Amen. Let's uh let's go to the next one and see what the prophet is saying here. Now I'm closing with this. I promise you in the next couple of minutes I'll be done. Prophet is discerning somebody now and he says I'm I'm trying to show you something how these things are the issues of life coming from the heart. He's discerning this person and he says he knowed you since you were born but I see you're suffering with a tremendous nervous condition. one of those types that hurt you. Makes you think deep. Always planning things, you never get to them. See, so you're planning things, you never get to them. [clears throat] Amen. It never happens that way. Always crossing bridges before you get them. Taking other people's worries. He says, "You believe? Would you do what I told you to?" Now, standing here all your life, you've been nervous, right? You have a nervous person. You're not a nervous person that shakes. So, we can't see physically looking at you, we can't see that you're nervous. You're a nervous person by thinking. You're always pre-planning things, going ahead, planning things ahead. Usually never happens that way. We call it crossing bridges before you get to them. In doing that, you formed a stomach trouble. &gt;&gt; Now, remember, this is a prophet discerning it. &gt;&gt; Spirits don't die, &gt;&gt; right? nervous person thinking troubled he says your form it's stomach trouble it's an ulcer in your stomach it's nervousness you quit being nervous there's no need of being nervous Jesus is with you go on your road rejoicing thanking God and praising him you'll get completely well in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; amen let's get to the next one if you want something to happen you'll have to take my word for it if I'm planning on doing something I know better than to tell anyone about it. Amen. So, don't tell your plans to Satan. Satan will hear it. Amen. I think I'm done. I just want to say this in summary that God's perfect plan for us in this time in the 21st century now is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; This is God's perfect plan. &gt;&gt; The seals are open so that we can succeed and prosper against the enemy. &gt;&gt; There's no lack in the message of the hour. This is a blessed land flowing with milk and honey. After seven church ages, God led us to this land of our inheritance. A land of joy, a land of love, a land of the Holy Ghost with living bread of life to sustain us in this journey. This is our part. The rapture, the shout message, living bread of life. Let's stand together. Give him praise. [applause] Hallelujah. Amen. God has a plan for our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's live it with purpose. We don't know if the Lord will call us home today. We don't know if the Lord will call us home tomorrow. We don't know if we have one summer left, two summers left. We don't know our time and season. But let's live it to our full potential. Let's live it to according to God's plan. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. God's plan for your life is a glorious plan. Amen. So if you're sick, I want you to align with God's word. His word says by his stripes you were healed. &gt;&gt; If you're in lack, God's word says, "I'm Jehovah Gyro, your provider." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you if you are in trouble, God says, "I'm Jehovah Shalom. I am your peace." &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are being led astray, God says, [music] "I am your shepherd. I'll lead you. These are the redemptive blessings of God. Let's plan for success. Meditate on the word. Keep the word in your mouth and do the word. [music] Praise the Lord. Oh, he's worthy to be praised. Worthy of honor. Amen. We just want to worship him and give him praise now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And say, "Father, if I misaligned from your plan, realign me to your plan." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We haven't come just to listen to a sermon. The spirit is trying to speak to you, to tell you, follow God's plan for your life. Your own plan might lead you down destructive pathways, [music] but God has a plan for your life. Choose God. Choose his plan. Choose his purpose. Why don't you want to flourish in his presence? [music] You're going to dry up. You know, the prophet of God says this, when you when you're burning coal and you got all the coal together, &gt;&gt; it stays hot, stays on fire. &gt;&gt; He says, but you take a coal out of there and you place it one side. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Watch how it gets cold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It gets formal, it starts to die out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
