[44:30] want to read one portion of
[44:32] scripture and in the Book of Romans 8
[44:36] and verse 11 the Bible says but if the
[44:39] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[44:43] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[44:47] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[44:50] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[44:52] dwelleth in you may the Lord add a
[44:55] blessing to the reading of the word
[45:00] Hallelujah my brothers and
[45:02] sisters there was one time a great
[45:05] Caesar
[45:07] austa who won the Victory and won the
[45:10] battle and as he won the battle there
[45:13] was a celebration that they were going
[45:14] to give him in the land of
[45:17] Rome and uh in order to celebrate he
[45:20] wanted one worthy man to join him and my
[45:24] brothers and sisters he the the news
[45:27] went around and all the soldiers and the
[45:29] army people they got ready and they
[45:32] shined up their armors and their swords
[45:35] and so on Hallelujah and they all lined
[45:38] up and when they lined up they went to
[45:41] King Caesar austa and as he looked at
[45:44] the first sergeant or or the general
[45:48] Hallelujah they were able to salute but
[45:51] he shook his head and he and and he
[45:53] passed by because C austa was looking
[45:56] for one
[45:58] person and it didn't meet the
[46:00] requirements and eventually Soldier by
[46:02] Soldier they passed his
[46:04] aasta and after a short while there was
[46:07] a little
[46:08] footman he didn't have any Shield that
[46:12] was polished neither did he have any
[46:14] plume to trim but he walked in front of
[46:17] Caesar sir he didn't even know the right
[46:20] way to salute but he bowed his head and
[46:23] walked away Cesar said wait a minute who
[46:26] are you
[46:28] come back here he walked up and looked
[46:30] at him he said there's cars over his
[46:32] face there's cuts and disness and
[46:36] crippled up where did you get them SCS
[46:39] at Caesar austa asked him and he said
[46:43] out in the battlefield fighting for my
[46:46] Lord
[46:47] Caesar and Cesar Augustus said climb up
[46:50] here sit down by my side you are the one
[46:54] that's been tested and proved
[46:57] my brothers and sisters a few days ago
[47:00] the same thing happened there was a

[47:27] the Battle Scars of preaching the gospel
[47:29] the highways and the byways and he real
[47:32] realized that they needed a rest amen
[47:35] and because they needed a rest he said
[47:38] Hallelujah I want you to he didn't look
[47:40] for the salute amen he didn't look for a
[47:42] theological decree for that type of
[47:44] salute Hallelujah he wanted a soldier
[47:47] that was chosen before the foundation of
[47:49] the world was called by almighty God
[47:52] hallelujah and he found fit Hallelujah
[47:55] that these two Hallelujah

[1:00:03] blessed and to the family you know that
[1:00:05] is what Ra was preaching about all his
[1:00:09] life so just remember that although it's
[1:00:12] going to be very difficult uh especially
[1:00:16] now in this time when you lost sister
[1:00:19] Grace lost her husband and his
[1:00:21] son uh but I know that the Lord will see
[1:00:25] all through
[1:00:26] we continuously pray for you all that
[1:00:29] God will comfort you all strengthen you
[1:00:31] and see you through this time my brother
[1:00:34] only
[1:00:35] was one of seven
[1:00:37] children we were two sisters and five
[1:00:41] brothers uh my one sister is surviving
[1:00:44] she's she's closer to 80 now and
[1:00:49] myself
[1:00:53] uh Ron uh you know know we had a very
[1:00:57] hard life from the very beginning and we
[1:01:01] were we lost our dad when we were very
[1:01:04] young
[1:01:07] uh and my mother she look out with seven
[1:01:11] children and she raised all of us and we
[1:01:14] all of us including brother Ronnie did
[1:01:17] our job by helping my mother uh you know
[1:01:21] uh buying vegetables in the Indian
[1:01:24] market and selling
[1:01:26] day every
[1:01:28] day uh and mostly on weekends Saturdays
[1:01:31] I know brother Ron My Brother Jay myself
[1:01:34] we'll all go and help my mother and
[1:01:36] that's how she raised us up and she
[1:01:38] raised good children and my BR brother
[1:01:41] only was one of
[1:01:43] them he was very humble kind
[1:01:47] polite never in normal life I so angry
[1:01:51] or upset or violent
[1:01:57] he survived many tragedies in his life
[1:02:01] one of them I remember when he
[1:02:03] was a young boy I think maybe about 12
[1:02:08] or so we were living in second river and
[1:02:12] he went to the supermarket there and
[1:02:15] that Supermarket they had some very
[1:02:18] vicious
[1:02:19] dogs and when he went to the supermarket
[1:02:21] I don't know why that day they left the
[1:02:23] dogs open so one of the dogs got look I
[1:02:27] think just above his his knee he had to
[1:02:31] under go surgery and he had many
[1:02:33] stitches and then also in life he also
[1:02:36] had a very serious accident when he uh
[1:02:39] and he broke his leg and I think he he
[1:02:42] his shoulder and other parts of his body
[1:02:44] and then he also had a bypass I think is
[1:02:48] triple or quadruple bypass and he
[1:02:50] survived all that by the grace of
[1:02:53] God and uh
[1:02:58] as I said I never saw him very angry he
[1:03:02] came through and done his duty and
[1:03:04] finished the course his entire life was
[1:03:07] dedicated to preaching this gospel
[1:03:09] anytime you see him the home he's always
[1:03:13] reading listening to the message or
[1:03:15] doing something about the
[1:03:19] gospel and of course brother Sean is
[1:03:23] also a chip of the old block he just
[1:03:25] like his very humble jial respectful
[1:03:29] very decent person I never saw him as
[1:03:31] well angry or unhappy whenever I saw he
[1:03:34] was always happy he was always Jo and
[1:03:36] you know he got on very well with
[1:03:40] people you know the Bible says that we
[1:03:43] must train up our children the way they
[1:03:46] should go and when they grow up they
[1:03:49] will not depart from it and I can say
[1:03:52] that brother on has done a good job he
[1:03:54] trained his children up in the ways of
[1:03:56] the Lord and I'm sure that will always
[1:04:00] remain with them am I pray now and thank
[1:04:03] you uh uh for the family I pray uh
[1:04:07] especially now I know it's very
[1:04:10] difficult but God will see your through
[1:04:13] thank
[1:04:15] you
[1:04:18] thank bless you uh next we like to call
[1:04:22] our brother
[1:04:23] L give a speech also on of our Sean and
[1:04:28] also our
[1:04:40] [Music]
[1:04:50] Ronnie God bless brothers and
[1:04:52] sisters um my dad would have giving
[1:04:56] speech but um he's not able to because
[1:05:02] brother was a very close friend of his
[1:05:05] and Sean being his son-in-law I think
[1:05:08] it's
[1:05:10] U much over for him and the person that
[1:05:15] I think he had friends everywhere
[1:05:17] he and
[1:05:22] um the thing is that you know Sean you
[1:05:26] could if he was angry with him talk to
[1:05:28] about something automatically changed
[1:05:30] your because it was that's his nature he
[1:05:33] just smil at you and and that was way it
[1:05:36] would end and
[1:05:41] even we've known him for many years um I
[1:05:44] think it's close to about 30 plus uh
[1:05:47] little children we all played together
[1:05:49] and later on life um he started dating
[1:05:53] my sister and got married
[1:05:56] um but yeah we've been really close to
[1:05:58] them about I think a month or two back
[1:06:02] um Ron was at my dad's house and came to
[1:06:05] visit and now Al also they we had quite
[1:06:08] a long conversation you know and and I
[1:06:10] think it was the first time they
[1:06:12] actually did as one thing Ron always
[1:06:14] jokes with me is that he says know this
[1:06:16] guy doesn't get brown because when I was
[1:06:18] little I used to shouldn't like to get
[1:06:20] brown bread and uh now uh it's a very
[1:06:25] sad I think on all sides whether it's a
[1:06:28] church the family because they both were
[1:06:31] very close in that they both the very
[1:06:33] same nature similar nature they both had
[1:06:36] an impact Sean was quite a good Music
[1:06:38] musician he's had relationships with all
[1:06:41] different churches all different types
[1:06:43] of
[1:06:44] people and if you speak to anybody know
[1:06:46] but I know Sean either from Phoenix or
[1:06:49] Springfield Park or wherever he went he
[1:06:52] had friends and I think we've also seen
[1:06:54] that he at friends all over the world
[1:06:56] and that speaks a lot about their nature
[1:06:59] and and the the
[1:07:01] humbleness you know past R would do a
[1:07:04] lot of things to people but you never
[1:07:06] hear him mention
[1:07:07] it my dad was just telling me the other
[1:07:09] day you know this
[1:07:11] is and and the things that he did for
[1:07:13] people but it's never something that he
[1:07:16] would say even as a preacher never
[1:07:18] mention in front of anyone but you know
[1:07:20] he's he's a true man of God um and um
[1:07:25] and and also would like to say to
[1:07:27] brother Adrian and and and his family as
[1:07:30] well it must be a very difficult
[1:07:31] situation I can't imagine what the
[1:07:34] feeling is U I think a lot of us feel
[1:07:36] maybe a portion of it because um was was
[1:07:41] Pastor R was our pastor um and Sean was
[1:07:44] also very active within the church and
[1:07:48] and and even with friends and and and so
[1:07:50] on and most people that we that knew
[1:07:53] them were had a bond with with both of
[1:07:56] them it wasn't just one person and um I
[1:07:59] think for for my sister and and even his
[1:08:03] daughters it's it's a really difficult
[1:08:05] thing um and and at that point when when
[1:08:10] this did take place we we were so
[1:08:12] positive about about him and as well
[1:08:15] with the communication was was something
[1:08:17] that we we didn't even think that things
[1:08:20] would turn out this way and uh just pray
[1:08:24] that God blesses and comfort them is
[1:08:28] going to be something that they going to
[1:08:30] you know God's going to need to assist
[1:08:31] them through
[1:08:33] and I just like to thank a lord for for
[1:08:36] helping us in giving
[1:08:43] us thank you to
[1:08:45] that appreciate those kind words and of
[1:08:48] Pastor and Shan next we have our brother
[1:08:52] Joshua chy who's going to speak on

[1:09:30] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:09:32] Christ on behalf of our assembly son of
[1:09:36] man revealed
[1:09:43] Ministries we would like
[1:09:46] to IID like to say a few words on behalf
[1:09:49] of Pastor Ronnie genger also Our
[1:09:52] Shepherd and
[1:09:53] pastor andeci son
[1:09:57] joh if I truly speak of the
[1:10:01] characteristics of Pastor
[1:10:03] Ronnie he will take up volumes of words
[1:10:07] but truly he was a person of such
[1:10:10] remarkable character he left an imprint
[1:10:14] on you he was truly a man of God with a
[1:10:18] true
[1:10:19] calling in the office of the 54
[1:10:22] Ministry under the office of a pastor
[1:10:26] he was not a person who was tossed to
[1:10:28] and fro and carried about with every
[1:10:30] wind of Doctrine but he preached sound
[1:10:33] Doctrine and never
[1:10:35] wavered as brother Adrian said to me the
[1:10:38] other day a great oak tree has
[1:10:41] fallen Pastor Ronnie was very calculated
[1:10:44] in his
[1:10:45] decision if he had made a decision about
[1:10:47] something we could not convince him
[1:10:50] otherwise because he had already looked
[1:10:52] at the pros and
[1:10:53] cons he grew young ministers in the
[1:10:56] church and always encouraged the
[1:10:58] progression of the music department he
[1:11:01] loved the worship and he loved the
[1:11:03] world he loved each family he knew every
[1:11:07] child
[1:11:08] individually he labored in the ministry
[1:11:11] always visiting families in their homes
[1:11:15] even when they were in
[1:11:16] hospital always cared for the sick
[1:11:19] always look after the
[1:11:20] widows he never wanted to be an old man
[1:11:24] and always said God must take him home
[1:11:27] and always spoke of how death was just a
[1:11:29] door to take you to your Eternal
[1:11:32] destination today is rejoicing in that
[1:11:34] that sixth Dimension the church will
[1:11:37] truly miss him and we will be waiting
[1:11:40] earnestly for the resurrection to take
[1:11:42] place to meet out to meet our
[1:11:44] pastor our precious brother
[1:11:49] Sean is one of the most humble meest and
[1:11:53] sweetest characters I personally
[1:11:55] knew he loves music and always
[1:11:59] compliments the band when he plays his
[1:12:01] keyboard Sean was very connected with
[1:12:03] his
[1:12:04] father in so many ways when he was young
[1:12:08] he worked with him for many years and in
[1:12:11] the ministry he assisted him in music
[1:12:13] and I believe today they are united in
[1:12:15] glory together on behalf of son of man

[1:14:51] kind he couldn't stand to see me sad or
[1:14:54] upset
