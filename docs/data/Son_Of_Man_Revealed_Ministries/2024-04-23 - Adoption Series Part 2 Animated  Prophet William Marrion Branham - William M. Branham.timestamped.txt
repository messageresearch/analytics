[0:02] Genesis 1: 126 I'll pick it up
[0:05] Wednesday when God made man before he
[0:08] made man he called himself l e l l e l h
[0:13] l l

[0:19] self
[0:22] existence all by
[0:25] himself nothing existed before him he
[0:28] was all the existence the ever was
[0:31] self-existence
[0:33] on l l
[0:36] Elohim means all
[0:40] sufficient all
[0:42] powerful allm
[0:44] mighty
[0:47] self-existence
[0:49] one Hallelujah but in Genesis 2 when he
[0:52] made man he said I
[0:55] am y a h u j u v H yahu
[1:02] Jehovah what did it mean I am the all
[1:07] existence one who has created something
[1:10] all for myself to be a son of mine are a
[1:15] temporary are an amateur little one of
[1:23] mine why he gave
[1:27] man Jehovah means that he gave man to be
[1:30] an amateur
[1:32] God because he is Father God and he made
[1:37] a man an amateur God so he isn't
[1:39] self-existence anymore he exists with
[1:42] his
[1:45] family
[1:47] Hallelujah el el
[1:50] Elohim now now he is Jehovah Jehovah
[1:55] meaning the one who exists with his
[1:58] family
[2:00] now God made man to be the predominant
[2:04] over all the Earth he had
[2:07] dominion and the Earth was man's
[2:09] Dominion is that
[2:11] scripture then if that's his domain he
[2:14] was God over the
[2:16] Earth he could speak and it would be so
[2:19] he could speak this and it would be
[2:23] so amen there he is god

[4:17] slaying before the foundation of the
[4:20] world Hallelujah when was our names put
[4:23] in the Lamb's Book of Life when the lamb
[4:25] was slain before the foundation of the
[4:27] world when God was Jehovah el el Elohim
[4:33] the self-existence one just like one
[4:36] great big diamond and he could not be
[4:39] nothing else but inside of this diamond
[4:43] his attributes was a
[4:47] savior Amen in this attributes on the
[4:50] inside of him was a
[4:52] Healer Hallelujah well there was nothing
[4:55] to save and nothing to
[4:57] heal but his ATT
[5:00] produced
[5:01] it election looks back to for knowledge
[5:06] and predestination looks the
[5:08] destiny don't forget that that election
[5:13] looks back here here it is but all of a
[5:16] sudden I become a wheat
[5:18] grain how did it happen uh that what is
[5:22] that election God before the foundation
[5:25] of the world elected that the CER was to
[5:29] become I'm a grain of wheat now I know
[5:32] I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved
[5:33] how do I do it now let's read just a
[5:36] little farther and then we'll have to
[5:38] close pretty
[5:39] sharply according as he chose us in him
[5:43] before the foundation of the world that
[5:45] we should be holy Without Blame before
[5:48] him and love
[5:51] having
[5:53] predestinated
[5:54] us unto the
[5:57] adoption predestinated unto the adoption
[6:01] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[6:04] according to the good pleasure of his
[6:08] will what did he do he by for
[6:13] knowledge foresaw us knowing that he was
[6:18] a
[6:19] savior
[6:21] self-existence but in him
[6:25] was a
[6:28] savior amen well what's he going to say
[6:30] there's nothing
[6:32] lost knowing that then he know that this
[6:36] great attribute in him would project
[6:39] something out under that he could save
[6:43] then when he did that by four knowledge
[6:45] he looked down and he saw everyone that
[6:48] would accept
[6:51] it and while he did that he did that
[6:54] that he might save you who wants to be
[6:59] saved
[7:01] saved do you see what I
[7:04] mean by for knowledge amen the infinite
[7:08] God who know all things saw the lamb and
[7:13] he slayed the lamb before the foundation
[7:16] of the world and he put your name on the
[7:19] Lamb's Book of Life and he seen the
[7:20] deceitfulness of Satan what he would do
[7:23] so he put your name on there by election
[7:27] he chose them and by predes destination
[7:30] they know where they are
[7:32] going there you
[7:34] are now who could doubt that that's what
[7:38] Paul said that's Paul's
[7:42] scripture that's Paul's writing that's
[7:45] what he taught his church the church
[7:49] positionally before the foundation of
[7:52] the world when God in his labor pain was
[7:56] bringing forth bringing forth you
[7:59] knowing what you would do he

[8:05] body Amen to be a
[8:08] housewife to be a farmer to be a
[8:11] preacher to be a prophet to be this or
[8:14] to be that and then on next Sunday
