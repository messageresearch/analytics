[36:32] say
[36:34] the scariest place for the preacher to
[36:38] be
[36:45] the scariest place for it you know why
[36:50] because our people make him scared
[36:55] some of them don't smile they don't say
[36:57] hey man
[36:58] you know just sit and stare
[37:01] honestly as a preacher when they come
[37:04] and stand here they're scared
[37:06] they see no response from you it's scary
[37:11] but when you smile and say amen and you
[37:13] know
[37:14] praise the lord they're always saying
[37:15] they're happy they know you're
[37:17] responding
[37:19] they know they're not talking to zombies
[37:23] you know zombies uh something moving but
[37:26] it's dead
[37:27] you know it's got no life in it so don't
[37:29] worry about that
[37:30] anytime the preacher stands anybody
[37:33] scared if the
[37:34] congregate will not response don't
[37:36] respond
[37:38] but anyway i'm happy this morning
[37:41] because of the word amen
[37:45] we got a positive word amen amen we know
[37:48] we have the word
[37:50] how many of you believe you are saved
[37:51] this morning
[37:54] if you don't believe me you're saying
[37:56] why what you're doing here
[38:00] see if we believe we're not saying we
[38:02] won't be here
[38:04] so we believe we are saying we believe
[38:06] god called us
[38:08] we believe god revealed his word to us
[38:11] praise the lord we believe we are the
[38:13] end time bride
[38:14] amen amen praise the lord shall we know
[38:18] god
[38:18] god never sent this message he never

[38:44] group and i don't know what we began
[38:46] but we believe when we heard that word
[38:48] prays a lot
[38:50] you know i think some other prophet said
[38:53] we are learning from our theophany amen
[38:56] praise the lord see now maybe in this
[38:59] life here we get that despondent
[39:01] and you know we get the down hearted and
[39:04] we you know the flesh bed and all this
[39:07] thing but remember there's a spirit man
[39:10] see if the mushroom mustn't pay too much
[39:12] attention to the flesh man
[39:15] see if that's to get us down we worry
[39:18] people
[39:20] one day we're okay the next day we down
[39:23] you know
[39:24] grumpy but there's a spirit man there

[44:52] favor

[44:56] of god
[44:57] praise the lord i'll be glad for that
[45:00] amen we must be positive
[45:02] you know like the prophet said the
[45:03] brother that preached for so many years
[45:05] and
[45:06] he was ready to die now and everybody
[45:08] was in the room there
[45:09] and he got up and shook hands with the
[45:11] believers that died long ago
[45:14] calling them by name amen praise the
[45:16] lord
[45:18] they're not dead they're there amen so
[45:20] don't worry what happens you know
[45:23] just thank god the soul is saved amen
[45:25] because the devil can't touch the soul
[45:28] amen he can do what he like with his
[45:30] body
[45:31] praise the lord joel chapter 1
[45:35] the word of the lord came to joel the
[45:37] son of hezekiah
[45:39] gathers the old men and give here
[45:42] all the inhabitants of the land and this
[45:45] being in your days
[45:47] or even in the days of your fathers tell
[45:50] ye your children of it
[45:52] and let your children tell their
[45:53] children and their children
[45:56] another generation that which the farmer
[45:59] worm had left
[46:00] and the locust eaten amen and that which
[46:03] the locust
[46:03] had left at the cankerwood meeting and
[46:06] that was the candy worm
[46:08] at left and the caterpillar eaten that's
[46:12] the roman now there's
[46:14] four insects what one left
[46:19] if the other one started as soon as that
[46:22] other one
[46:22] finished the other one left start
[46:25] defeating what was left
[46:27] and the last one hit what was left
[46:30] praise wrong
[46:31] so there's four insects here right and
[46:34] i was listening to this message and i
[46:37] was just rejoicing
[46:39] praise the lord because what i saw here
[46:41] i saw the seals
[46:43] yes amen
[46:46] here the four dead insects
[46:50] and then the four horse riders are dead
[46:52] amen
[46:54] amen and actually the way the prophet is
[46:57] preaching it here
[46:59] is preaching the seals but he was
[47:02] preaching this in
[47:04] april 1962
[47:07] actually preaching the seals but 1963
[47:11] the seals is actually open amen what was
[47:15] sealed up all the time
[47:16] so you was preaching the seals all the
[47:18] time we didn't know it was the seals
[47:21] see whatever is preaching about the
[47:23] antichrist and all these three
[47:24] it's a seals part of it
[47:28] praise the lord that should make us
[47:32] rejoice
[47:33] and then god here he brings out
[47:36] these uh whatever we like to call it uh
[47:39] illustrations
[47:40] in the old testament and makes it
[47:43] applied to the new testament
[47:47] see how those things are taking place in
[47:49] the old testament
[47:50] and it brings that makes it apply here
[47:52] to the new testament amen
[47:55] you know sometimes maybe once in a while
[47:58] i think
[47:59] god was like unfair because when jesus
[48:02] came
[48:03] he says he came to his own his own
[48:04] received him not
[48:06] now who was his own and it seems like we
[48:10] the gentiles had a second chance
[48:14] they rejected him and he blinded them
[48:16] and he came to the gentiles
[48:18] so it seemed like we were the second
[48:20] choice but now we were there all the
[48:22] time
[48:22] amen we were predestinated
[48:26] before the foundations of the world so
[48:28] we've not checked
[48:29] second chance amen the bride is not
[48:32] second chance
[48:34] amen i'd be glad for that so there are
[48:37] things here in the old testament applies
[48:39] to that
[48:40] new testament the problem said it's
[48:42] shadows and types
[48:44] see if you take all those sevens in the
[48:46] bible and all stepping there
[48:48] then let's go to joel 2 25.
[48:54] praise the lord you'll see the seals
[48:55] over here and you'll see the day we are
[48:56] living in
[48:58] and i will restore
[49:02] i will restore amen to you
[49:06] the years that the locusts get heated
[49:10] and the cankerworm and the caterpillar
[49:17] my great army which i sent among you
[49:21] great army amen he's going to restore
[49:26] so all these insects are hit off of the
[49:30] stream
[49:32] he's going to restore i'll be glad for
[49:35] that
[49:36] we're going to be restored and the
[49:39] message here the prophet preaches
[49:41] restoration of the bride tree
[49:45] restoration of a bright tree so before
[49:48] we go in the rapture
[49:49] we're going to be a restored church with
[49:51] the word of god
[49:53] so all the enemy tried to take down and
[49:55] tear down from the churches and all this
[49:56] thing
[49:57] the bride is the rest of our church amen
[49:59] so he says i'll send you like the
[50:00] imagine the prophet he'll turn our
[50:02] hearts back to their
[50:03] fathers amen your original faith
[50:07] praise the lord i'll be glad for them
[50:08] amen let's bow here
[50:10] as god's blessing upon the world we last
[50:12] brother lionel to pray
[50:14] as god's blessing upon the word amen
[50:20] amen thank you lord for the
[50:23] praise and worship yes
[50:26] [Music]
[50:29] yes we give you glory and praise
[50:33] amen
[50:37] thank you lord
[50:48] yes praise the lord amen amen you will
[50:50] receive it
[50:51] so what is the bride the bride is the
[50:52] rest restored church
[50:55] amen there's churches out there praise
[50:58] wrong
[50:59] but the bride is restored
[51:02] amen we'd like to hear some amen because
[51:04] we know you're hearing the word
[51:07] i want you to be as happy now as you're
[51:09] going to be lunchtime
[51:13] you know when you're eating your chicken
[51:14] just now you're going to be happy
[51:16] i want you to be happy like that huh
[51:22] what jesus i will restore
[51:25] amen all that this insects have eaten i
[51:28] will restore
[51:30] praise the lord so that is what the
[51:31] bride is the bride is restored in there
[51:35] the word of god see now the prophet said
[51:39] yeah
[51:41] uh restore restore means to bring death
[51:46] restore bring back see all that they
[51:49] have eaten
[51:50] you bring back right
[51:53] and now these insects now god is using
[51:55] them as insects
[51:58] right but it's it's a it's a it's a
[52:00] system it's it's people
[52:02] it's spirits right but god is using them
[52:06] as the insect
[52:07] and then you look at this uh at the
[52:09] farmer where
[52:10] the locusts they look very similar
[52:14] see the papaw my locust looks very
[52:17] similar
[52:19] they can't do one see
[52:23] there's two of them look very similar
[52:25] one one is like the
[52:26] the locus and one look like a moth then
[52:29] you got the
[52:30] the palmer worm and they got a
[52:32] caterpillar
[52:34] see so these three these four insects
[52:37] are heating from the tree and one is
[52:40] eating the leaves
[52:43] the leaves of the tree the other one
[52:45] eats the fruits of the tree
[52:49] craves a lot right
[52:52] so the right
[52:56] what was eaten by the roots it was eaten
[52:59] by the roots that it destroyed
[53:03] if you know about dabbing and things
[53:05] plants in your garden
[53:07] if you see the trees drying up and you
[53:09] look at it right in the roots it's
[53:11] drying up no like plucking and throwing
[53:12] away
[53:14] it's not going to grow
[53:17] amen see so the life is in the room
[53:22] so restore means you bring back
[53:25] see enforced
[53:29] amen getting back to its
[53:33] rightful honor where it belongs
[53:37] now we spoke last week on redemption and
[53:40] reconciliation how god has redeemed us
[53:44] and we are reconciled but now we talk
[53:47] about restoration
[53:50] praise the lord redemption and
[53:53] reconciliation is what he did for us
[53:56] now the redemption is destroyed
[54:00] his church that the enemy came to attack
[54:04] the enemy came to destroy
[54:08] and plunder he said i'm going to destroy
[54:10] it
[54:12] and that's what the bride is
[54:15] amen he's taken he said what is going on
[54:18] he's going to chop out of those
[54:20] denominations
[54:21] a bride and she's going to be destroyed
[54:24] by the world
[54:26] praise the lord so that's what we are
[54:30] see we can't believe these things
[54:34] but if we are saved and we know we are
[54:36] the bride
[54:37] we believe what the prophet is bringing
[54:39] the word to us
[54:41] praise the lord that will understand
[54:42] these things
[54:44] right so to bring back to its original
[54:47] position
[54:48] therefore some way it went away from its
[54:50] rightful owner
[54:53] and can wander around anywhere but to
[54:56] restore
[54:57] he should bring it back to who really
[55:00] owns it
[55:03] and in order to do this we have a right
[55:05] to enforce
[55:07] there is a law
[55:10] we have a right to enforce the law
[55:13] because god has made it such
[55:15] he's got a law about it amen we can
[55:18] enforce the laws of god amen
[55:20] and it's going to work right like
[55:23] somebody stole some property
[55:25] and they're holding the primary captive
[55:27] that you can take the law
[55:30] and go to this person and the law for
[55:33] name
[55:35] somebody can't steal your property and
[55:37] click oh
[55:39] the title deed shows you are the owner
[55:42] you own that property amen see so if
[55:46] somebody stealing them was restoring
[55:47] back to you
[55:48] it belongs to you praise the lord so
[55:51] that's what he had to be done
[55:52] to the church of god he stole the church
[55:55] of god
[55:56] destroyed the church of god right
[55:59] from the from the holy days
[56:02] when god's church was full of the holy
[56:04] spirit on the day of pentecost
[56:06] amen and uh after jesus was
[56:10] crucified and they were hiding over
[56:12] there they always scared for the life
[56:14] but they were when they were full of the
[56:15] holy spirit they came out into the
[56:16] streets
[56:18] and then they started preaching the
[56:20] gospel and people were from different
[56:22] parts of their
[56:23] uh world over there and when pete and
[56:26] all started to preach
[56:28] and they all heard them in the whole
[56:30] town
[56:32] and they were speaking in tongues and
[56:33] they were you know acting like they were
[56:35] drunk and the people said listen yeah
[56:37] these men were drunk but look what i
[56:40] applies not for the new testament
[56:42] what did peter say no this is joel's
[56:45] prophecy
[56:47] amen joe chapter 2 amen your young man
[56:50] will
[56:52] see vision all men will read
[56:56] peter is referring to what's happening
[56:58] on the day of pentecost
[56:59] to joel's prophecy you read that second
[57:02] period chapter 14
[57:03] to 16. sorry second the book of acts
[57:08] acts chapter 2 14-16
[57:12] he said this is joel's prophecy they're
[57:14] not drunk as you suppose
[57:17] they follow the holy spirit and it says
[57:20] god said
[57:21] he will send his spirit and they will be
[57:24] full of the spirit amen
[57:26] so jenna says enforce
[57:31] then we have the privilege to enforce
[57:33] upon satan
[57:34] the claims that god give us we
[57:37] got a right to say we have a right to
[57:40] take the baptism back in the name of the
[57:41] lord jesus christ
[57:44] amen we've got the right to say one god
[57:46] manifested in three dispensations
[57:50] father son and the holy spirit is lord
[57:52] jesus christ
[57:54] see what the enemy did now we got our
[57:56] right to enforce the law
[57:59] and say it's god father son holy spirit
[58:05] and all the other teachings of lost
[58:08] through the ages
[58:09] we got the right to come and claim it
[58:12] because god has sent his brother to
[58:14] bring this world up
[58:16] restoration back to us
[58:19] no matter if the others don't want to
[58:20] believe it
[58:22] it's not sent for the others praise the
[58:25] lord it's sent for the bride
[58:28] they do not believe it at all and say
[58:29] lord how can a snake talk and all these
[58:32] things and everything else
[58:33] but the bible says it was the most
[58:35] subtle of all the beasts of the field
[58:38] and he was talking huh
[58:42] yes he was in a snake crawling on the
[58:45] floor
[58:46] and talking to him no he was standing
[58:49] there like a man he was between the
[58:52] animal kingdom and the human kingdom and
[58:55] he was talking
[58:57] praise the lord then after that god put
[59:00] the curse on him
[59:02] to go crawling on his belly and eat the
[59:04] dust of the earth
[59:06] praise the lord see so the the word he
[59:08] said to the bride
[59:10] the restored church francis i'll tell
[59:13] you what
[59:13] if you are not eating from this world if
[59:15] you're not living up this world
[59:17] except in the flesh of the son of man
[59:18] and drink his blood we're going to be
[59:20] dead
[59:22] that is the truth if you're not fishing
[59:24] on this world you're going to die
[59:26] amen this word brings life to us yes
[59:29] amen we live by the word of god
[59:32] amen so we must take this word and live
[59:34] by it amen
[59:36] amen prophesy again when we come to
[59:40] church we are promising again
[59:42] when we're preaching we are prophesying
[59:43] again
[59:45] the true word of god praise the lord
[59:48] see so now we have a right to enforce it
[59:52] praise the lord therefore we have a
[59:55] right to
[59:56] force these claims upon satan and say
[59:58] give it back
[1:00:00] amen he has to do it because he can't
[1:00:03] take god's agent
[1:00:05] the holy spirit go right down our knees
[1:00:08] and say
[1:00:09] it's just say the lord he's got to give
[1:00:11] you that that's all
[1:00:13] because the holy spirit is there to make
[1:00:16] him do it
[1:00:18] see so the the one that are deceived by
[1:00:21] satan
[1:00:22] is holding all to his false teaching
[1:00:25] so you can show them where this teaching
[1:00:28] started
[1:00:29] the false teaching in the godhead and
[1:00:31] the baptism
[1:00:33] no they'll hold on to that but we got
[1:00:36] claims to take it back
[1:00:38] we said the first original church
[1:00:40] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:00:42] christ and we the last church got to
[1:00:44] baptize also
[1:00:45] in the name of the lord jesus christ the
[1:00:48] first that believe in one god
[1:00:49] amen and the rest of them were
[1:00:52] territorials
[1:00:53] we have a right to come back and say we
[1:00:55] believe in one god
[1:00:57] i remember the prophet said not true god
[1:00:59] and three god
[1:01:00] one god we have a right to take it back
[1:01:04] praise the lord so that's what we're
[1:01:05] saying if we don't live by this word
[1:01:07] we're gonna die
[1:01:10] literally mean you must feast on this
[1:01:12] world
[1:01:14] at home you must play the tents
[1:01:17] you got it on your phones now amen
[1:01:21] you got it all the time with you you can
[1:01:24] be busy
[1:01:24] but you can be listening to the world

[1:07:53] amen so this one here is a world
[1:07:56] changing world see so we're gonna go a
[1:08:00] little faster and say now
[1:08:02] that there's these insects here that is
[1:08:04] heating from the church
[1:08:05] and the frog said they attacked the
[1:08:07] church and they started eating from the
[1:08:09] church
[1:08:10] and uh and all the and the fruits first
[1:08:14] the first insecure lost i'm not gonna
[1:08:18] go into the bible and explain to you
[1:08:19] must go up and listen to it
[1:08:21] the long message but go and study it
[1:08:24] add the fruits now look at the fruits
[1:08:27] that was in the church
[1:08:29] nine spiritual gifts then he became an
[1:08:32] editor of the church
[1:08:35] they no longer believe in those things
[1:08:38] see
[1:08:39] then he started attacking the leaves
[1:08:42] the prophet said leaves means divine
[1:08:44] healing
[1:08:46] some don't want to believe in healing
[1:08:48] some chapters say
[1:08:50] even if somebody got healed i won't
[1:08:51] believe it
[1:08:53] i think especially their jehovah's
[1:08:54] witness they don't believe in healing
[1:08:58] then the enemy came here the part that
[1:09:01] protecting the tree
[1:09:04] amen then it went to the pub the life
[1:09:09] that is all refr uh referring to the
[1:09:12] church
[1:09:14] that once was there it had all these
[1:09:17] things in it
[1:09:19] while these insects came and hated her
[1:09:22] now you know the locals here are causing
[1:09:25] a havoc in
[1:09:26] parts of africa ethiopia and somalia and
[1:09:30] they can go there and eat the whole
[1:09:32] field of god
[1:09:34] or whatever they're planting destroyed
[1:09:38] see so god is using that to show the
[1:09:41] enemy
[1:09:42] and he brought distraction to the church
[1:09:45] and he said i will restore amen
[1:09:49] see saruman the bride is a restoration
[1:09:52] amen

[1:09:56] when people get sick we pray more amen
[1:09:59] they don't say no i'm serving you god
[1:10:00] i'm preaching your word
[1:10:02] and all this thing and why do you struck
[1:10:04] me look at these pastors gallant men of
[1:10:05] god

[1:10:09] because the bible says the son shall
[1:10:11] follow them that believe
[1:10:13] impairment they'll cast on devils amen
[1:10:15] in my name they'll be healed
[1:10:17] amen we're believing and
[1:10:20] and even this blessing i was listening
[1:10:22] to francis you know

[1:10:34] do
[1:10:35] biopsy and then to find out it's this

[1:21:39] same light as in the west right the
[1:21:42] enemy tried to
[1:21:43] cut down and destroy and what's the
[1:21:46] evening light come out to do
[1:21:50] what is the evening light for to restore
[1:21:54] amen and what is the evening light is
[1:21:56] this message
[1:21:58] what does that even like to do restore
[1:22:01] amen
[1:22:03] you get it the evening light
[1:22:06] is for the same purpose the morning
[1:22:09] light was for
[1:22:10] to restore what was cut down by the dark
[1:22:14] ages now what happened in the black ages
[1:22:18] take the seals now huh
[1:22:21] 68 million christians were killed
[1:22:25] preaching the seals yeah but he's not
[1:22:27] telling us it's the seals
[1:22:30] because the sales open 63.
[1:22:33] even if you read the church book that
[1:22:36] church enters
[1:22:37] the seals amen
[1:22:40] for them walking in the midst of the
[1:22:41] churches
[1:22:43] and the antichrist was there attacking
[1:22:46] and everything else killing
[1:22:48] that but he was there
[1:22:51] so the dark ages through rome coming in
[1:22:54] the dark ages to the room
[1:22:56] god is going to restore
[1:23:00] by shining forth the evening light
[1:23:03] so what is this blessing it's an evening
[1:23:05] light
[1:23:07] it's not a church denomination
[1:23:10] that's why we got no affiliation with
[1:23:12] church denomination
[1:23:14] they are not part of god's word the
[1:23:17] revealed restored word
[1:23:20] you take anybody that can open the bible
[1:23:22] they can they can preach all the stories
[1:23:24] in the bible
[1:23:26] that's why they're preaching things in
[1:23:28] their bible but god has opened the world
[1:23:30] that was healed
[1:23:33] there was thing that was not spoken of
[1:23:36] the holy spirit brings that word and
[1:23:38] reveals it to the blind the church
[1:23:42] god works in mysterious ways
[1:23:46] now okay we know the first four
[1:23:49] oscillators went
[1:23:51] by still writing in the payloads isn't
[1:23:53] it the fourth
[1:23:54] stage the next one souls under the altar
[1:23:58] what are they waiting for how long how
[1:24:01] long
[1:24:02] must we wait then he said no wait
[1:24:04] because your brother
[1:24:05] also must be avenged just like you were
[1:24:09] must wait so the souls are waiting there
[1:24:13] the rider is in his fourth stage
[1:24:16] payloads
[1:24:17] waiting to be fully manifested in the
[1:24:20] tribulation time
[1:24:21] the pride will be gone now
[1:24:25] first they're under the altar so the
[1:24:27] sixth seal is
[1:24:29] tribulation who sets that sixth seal in
[1:24:32] motion the problem said
[1:24:34] moses and elijah the next one is the
[1:24:38] seventh seal but now i'll come before
[1:24:41] the sixth seal
[1:24:42] the seventh seal revelation 10 and the
[1:24:44] prophet said
[1:24:45] revelation 10 and revelation 8 is
[1:24:47] connected amen
[1:24:48] amen amen
[1:24:52] how come before the 6th seal
[1:24:55] the 7th seal is made on
[1:24:59] and he says who is that seventh seal
[1:25:01] it's christ
[1:25:03] see he says you see that notable angel
[1:25:07] christ amen so before the tribulation
[1:25:10] come
[1:25:11] and the prophet said this messenger is
[1:25:13] the time of the earth
[1:25:15] at the time that this angel is coming
[1:25:17] down of revelation 10
[1:25:20] amen so god is not working in a sequence
[1:25:22] of
[1:25:23] one two three four five six seven
[1:25:27] before the tribulation he's got to get
[1:25:29] the bride ready to go before the

[1:25:36] with the hopeful book
[1:25:39] the word reveal to the bride
[1:25:42] so she can go up in the rapture then the
[1:25:45] tribulation
[1:25:48] can you see that now we're still waiting
[1:25:51] for the sixth seal
[1:25:52] but the seven seal is already open
[1:25:56] that's why he said he's a muslim nobody
[1:25:58] knows it here
[1:26:00] it's a not a mystery to the bride
[1:26:03] he's come down he showed himself this
[1:26:06] whole message is a sixth is the seventh
[1:26:08] seal christ

[1:31:22] concentrating on the word
[1:31:24] and want all these fleshly
[1:31:26] demonstrations
[1:31:28] jesus is not a fleshly demonstration

[1:33:53] that
[1:33:55] so don't be wary of the message

[1:34:03] amen we just gotta believe and follow
[1:34:06] and serve him

[1:35:14] so that then he says you shall be full
[1:35:18] we must be like david now as the art
[1:35:20] pattern after the waterproof

[1:35:25] along amen
[1:35:27] he has a longing he had frogs he had
[1:35:30] failures
[1:35:33] but his heart was planting you know like
[1:35:35] the rabbit was looking for that water
[1:35:38] my soul is dusting after you
[1:35:41] that is our desire amen and
[1:35:45] we are we are trapped in this body here
[1:35:49] we need to get out of this body
[1:35:52] we will be yearning to get out of it
[1:35:55] and i tell you what those people that
[1:35:57] had the experience of coming out of this
[1:35:58] body
[1:35:59] and they were looking down they never
[1:36:01] had no pain
[1:36:03] they were completely different that
[1:36:05] thinking were different
[1:36:07] and they they got got highs they can see
[1:36:10] they've got years they can hear they've
[1:36:13] got mug they can speak
[1:36:16] yeah the testament is there
[1:36:19] how come the prophet now when when god
[1:36:21] gave him a preview
[1:36:22] he came out of there he was able to talk
[1:36:24] over there
[1:36:26] he was able to see
[1:36:29] huh we got a far keener side than our
[1:36:33] natural eyes
[1:36:36] we got spiritual eyes waiting
[1:36:40] amen we got a sight
[1:36:43] and hearing and speech and everything
[1:36:49] see so god's time is dealing for us to
[1:36:52] go home
[1:36:54] and you know he's going to set up his
[1:36:55] kingdom
[1:36:57] and we know he's going to be sitting
[1:36:59] down the throne of david in the
[1:37:00] millennium
[1:37:02] ruling and reigning amen one man
[1:37:05] so that's why the antichrist now is
[1:37:07] moving to have a one world
[1:37:09] government one world system
[1:37:12] everybody must look to him what is the
[1:37:15] ring you know each time he's ahead
[1:37:18] he knows all this who's going to come to
[1:37:19] christ
[1:37:21] see some of the bible says thessalonians
[1:37:24] 2nd thessalonians
[1:37:25] man of sin sitting in the temple of god

[1:37:40] and he's got it for a time
[1:37:43] they don't know the worshiping satan
[1:37:46] when they deny his word their worshiping
[1:37:47] satan

[1:37:51] followed the holy spirit
[1:37:53] and deny the word say you'll you'll
[1:37:56] correspond you'll respond to the word
[1:37:58] see so god now is bringing us is going
[1:38:01] on time
[1:38:04] see he want to restore everything

[1:38:12] let the church know exactly what he's
[1:38:14] doing prays a lot

[1:38:20] see that's why he sent us his word now
[1:38:22] bring it to the bride
[1:38:25] i says here now noah had three rooms in
[1:38:27] his heart
[1:38:28] one room for the creepy things see the
