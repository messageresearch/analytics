Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord God, we can come up more higher, &gt;&gt; Lord God, that you will, as one songwriter said, you will still work on me, &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord God, to think about it, Lord, in this little insignificant place. &gt;&gt; You're using this place, Lord, &gt;&gt; to raise people to your image. Oh Lord God, wherever we are failed in taught in word and in deed, &gt;&gt; we ask Lord you'll forgive us &gt;&gt; Lord God. And we just want to thank you as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You have already taught us that we have no desire to do wrong. &gt;&gt; We thank you oh God that you judge us by our deeds but you judge us by our desires. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; bless your people. Bless your servant, Lord God, in this part of the vineyard, &gt;&gt; the varying pastors, Lord, the spirit in this place. &gt;&gt; Anoint and keep us in Jesus precious name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We thank God for the worship tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the songs. We thank God for the music. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, God's prophet said, "Never let the spirit of worship and clean holiness die from the church." &gt;&gt; Don't let it die. So, you know, it has two wings. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, there's two wings for this bird to fly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; One wing is worship &gt;&gt; because you are born to worship. &gt;&gt; You are created to worship. &gt;&gt; And that worship is balanced by a clean life. &gt;&gt; And this bird going to fly. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. The gospel according to us in Mark uh Matthew chapter 16 [Applause] from verses 13 to 19 by the grace of the Lord. I'm going to read by the grace of God. When Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria Philippi, he's asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man? And they said, "Some say that thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremas &gt;&gt; or one of the prophets." &gt;&gt; He said unto them, "But whom say he that I am?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered unto said unto him, "Blessed art thou, &gt;&gt; Simon Bejonah, &gt;&gt; for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto &gt;&gt; but my father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say unto thee that thou and Peter, &gt;&gt; and upon this rock I'll build my church, &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell shall never prevail against it. &gt;&gt; May the Lord God bless his precious words &gt;&gt; to your hearts. You may be seated by God's grace, as one preacher said, you know, as you turn in your Bibles, she say, he say, in case you don't have your Bible, the handwriting is on the wall. So that is my straight. I didn't wait for you to the flipping of the pages. Amen. One more time. It's a privilege to be here and privilege to be in this particular group of brethren brethren by God's grace. Some 18 years ago I was privileged to be here. Amen. Our precious pastor Ronnie and the church in those days I was at school. Amen. and uh as a church and as a people, our prayers were with you during that period of time. Amen. That your dear pastor, your dear believer, his dear son was taken to glory by the grace of the Lord. Amen. Certainly appreciate ministers here. Amen. And all their support and we as we said last night, it's a great sign for the future. Amen. is a great sign for us all when ministers could come together, amen, and agree by the grace of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I was seeing a a little um advert of this meeting &gt;&gt; and the advert of the meeting was talking about Holy Ghost anointed preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This Wednesday. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. I have no problem. I I I was challenging it what it meant. Amen. And said that um he heard me ministering in was it Zimbabwe and that thought strike him &gt;&gt; but anyhow we're going to fool a little bit. They ain't much peace to run &gt;&gt; but um all that is a part as pastors as ministers all that is a part of the of the word right &gt;&gt; the greatest anointing Amen. Amen. And as God's prophet said, we have the Holy Spirit in measure. &gt;&gt; We have it in a measure. Amen. But our Lord had it without measure. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that great is anointing. Amen. Amen. That you open the word and speak to them. &gt;&gt; So I pray, oh God, Amen. that um in whatever form the anointing come that we receive it by God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to share a thought with ourselves. I think I I I prefer to say that way because I I tend to believe sometime we we of course we ministers came from the congregation. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Once we were sitting where you sitting &gt;&gt; we were not always here. &gt;&gt; Okay. So I mean we didn't jump from somewhere and jump here. &gt;&gt; We know we went through the mill by the grace of the Lord. And you know you have to take away a perception that ministers are anything different &gt;&gt; from anybody else. &gt;&gt; It it is God's business and God choose who you want to choose. God anoint who you want to anoint. We have no say in that matter. But you know what I I like to uh think about you know that even when we preach here we preach to ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just got arrested here too. &gt;&gt; Yes. We just get condemned here to it. &gt;&gt; Let's go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to share a thought with you. The Lord will help us as we like to see it this way. None of us could could say say anything worth saying unless God help you to see. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Those of us who followed our meetings, that quote is one of my favorite quotes. Our precious brother mentioned, "Amen. I never preach a sermon yet." &gt;&gt; And if William Brandon could see that, who am I? Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, we must stop trying to feel we are better than anybody &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit preach a sermon to us. And I we don't want to stop there. &gt;&gt; We don't want to stop there tonight. We want the Holy Spirit to hear the sermon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this must go from pulpit to puke &gt;&gt; the Holy Because if you're not in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How you going to receive? &gt;&gt; What the holy spirit saying? Yes, &gt;&gt; that's why there one or two elementary things when we were young people elementary &gt;&gt; insignificant to somebody but you don't come to church just so &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; you pray for the services &gt;&gt; you pray for the pastor &gt;&gt; you pray for the song leader &gt;&gt; don't come to church like a block of ice &gt;&gt; and by the time the hour and a half no talk &gt;&gt; amen come to church as a block ice Block eyes &gt;&gt; and block eyes take time to melt. &gt;&gt; And by the time you melt, &gt;&gt; you ain't hear nothing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let's take a little bit of our time. &gt;&gt; I know these brothers, they trust me. &gt;&gt; Right to give me a watch. They kind of trust me, right? I don't always break the speed limit. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. I want to take a thought from the message communion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paragraph 63. God's prophet tells us here &gt;&gt; as I believe it was Jesus said to Pilate &gt;&gt; something a word I was thinking and he said there just a few moments ago. &gt;&gt; Who told you that? &gt;&gt; Let's go. What or was it revealed to you? &gt;&gt; How did you know these things? &gt;&gt; In other words, I don't just what the word word is now. It has been a long time since I read it. &gt;&gt; But how did you &gt;&gt; Pilate was saying something? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And Jesus said, "Pilot, boy, where you get that from?" How did you know this? &gt;&gt; What now? Who revealed this to you about him being the son of God? &gt;&gt; Who revealed it to you? Did some man tell you that &gt;&gt; or as Jesus said, is it my father in heaven which has revealed it to you? &gt;&gt; Let's go on. &gt;&gt; How did you learn it? &gt;&gt; Yes. is second hand or or is it a perfect revelation from God &gt;&gt; as we worship the Lord this evening &gt;&gt; as we search the word this evening &gt;&gt; we all here to worship &gt;&gt; is your worship a perfect revelation &gt;&gt; is your worship a revelation you got from God &gt;&gt; or is it secondhand Yes, &gt;&gt; it is something somebody tell you. &gt;&gt; You know, you as a matter of fact, the great challenge in this age &gt;&gt; is the second generation believers. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. All of us. &gt;&gt; If you ever in the realms of the world, we know there's a second generation, you know, and as God's prophet tells us, the best people in in the earth is our children. They are the best. M &gt;&gt; they are the best for many reasons. They were offered unto the Lord as babies, &gt;&gt; right? That's why we always like to tell our people, you don't dedicate your babies out of tradition. &gt;&gt; You you dedicate them because that's the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So our children are the best. &gt;&gt; Other than that, they are exposed to the true gospel. &gt;&gt; They didn't get any that story outside of what people call religion. So you see they get a good start, &gt;&gt; right? The only bad thing if I set the wrong example, &gt;&gt; are you all right with me? &gt;&gt; Not very, &gt;&gt; right? Because no matter what the church do, if I set the wrong example in my home, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; then I can hinder my children. &gt;&gt; Are you okay with that? &gt;&gt; Good. So the important thing is that uh the our children you know of course we live in an age of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Everybody know this message. &gt;&gt; Everybody all of them have phone everybody have iPad and they could quote. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you're like time we had a fight and you know try to we prophet say that and search it. No you bright everybody could win. But the question tonight, do we have a perfect revelation &gt;&gt; or is it a secondand revelation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A secondhand revelation will never see you through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My mother, my father, my brother, my sister, my church. M &gt;&gt; I can have the best church in the world and the most inspired church &gt;&gt; but that doesn't give you a revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have you the individual. &gt;&gt; And I want to trust God tonight that we could look at that through the scripture &gt;&gt; and identify. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do I at this time in my life has a perfect revelation or do I have a secondand revelation? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go. So in the scripture we read Jesus asking the disciples, he asking them a question. Amen. Jesus is asking his disciples a straightforward question. When Jesus came into the course of Caesar of Philippi, he asked his disciples &gt;&gt; a question. &gt;&gt; And the question he asked them is, who Amen. Whom do men say that I, the son of man, am? &gt;&gt; Amen. Who do men say that I, the son of man, am? M &gt;&gt; of course and they answered some say amen that you are Moses thou art John the Baptist some say you are Elias &gt;&gt; some say you are Jeremas &gt;&gt; and some say you are the prophets so you turn around the question I don't want to ask you who who do men see &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; who do you see &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; amen they bring about a good understanding of what people say but he throw it back to them. Who do whom do he say? Whom do he say I am? &gt;&gt; So he what what Jesus is directing I am not too concerned about what somebody think. &gt;&gt; I am not too concerned about what somebody say. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I am not asking you what somebody say. M &gt;&gt; I want to ask you who do you say &gt;&gt; who do you say &gt;&gt; that I the son of man am &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; what it brings us to church individuals salvation is not based upon what somebody say &gt;&gt; yes sir &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; amen salvation is not based upon what somebody see. &gt;&gt; So here comes the ignorant and the unlearned. And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thou art the Christ. &gt;&gt; As God's prophet said, he never hesitated &gt;&gt; to give an answer. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; He answered it straight forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. He come like the Holy Spirit got hold up upon him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and he speak like he speak in tongues. &gt;&gt; Draw it fast. He burst forth. Thou art the Christ. &gt;&gt; What is called a tremendous statement. &gt;&gt; So here it was the man who answered the question. Amen. Amen. God's prophet said he use a word impetuous. Mhm. &gt;&gt; He say Peter Peter is talk too much. &gt;&gt; Peter the kind of man he's talk all the time. &gt;&gt; You remember when the Lord want to wash your foot? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You have it. He quick to talk. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Peter the fellow when he went on transfiguration and he see action. He say I go build church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Always out of time. &gt;&gt; Brother call him impetuous Peter. Amen. But this time &gt;&gt; he was inspired. &gt;&gt; Amen. This time he was inspired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou art the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; And Jesus continued with him, blessed are thou, Simon Bonah. &gt;&gt; Blessed are thou. Because see what you say Peter, your mother didn't tell you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your father didn't tell you church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; Come on. I hope our our worship doesn't depend on pastor. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Our worship was not depend upon songs. &gt;&gt; Our worship was not depend upon what people say. &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember how they discussed this? Father, Peter was a trouble talking out of place. &gt;&gt; You know, uh, you can't wash my foot. You know what I mean? Always saying all kind of things. But this time &gt;&gt; he was direct in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. This time he ain't get no rebuke. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You remember he was get behind me. &gt;&gt; All time. You always get in trouble. &gt;&gt; But this time you get no trouble. &gt;&gt; This time that answer get him no trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So our Lord is telling Peter, Amen. You never learn that evening, church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we could tell you of a great man called Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And this great man called Moses, he had his mother as his teacher. &gt;&gt; And his mother taught him. &gt;&gt; You are the child. &gt;&gt; You have a great testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I put you in a basket. I did this for you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The Lord inspired me to do this for you. &gt;&gt; And you know it's true what I did. &gt;&gt; You know you end up in some water there &gt;&gt; and Pharaoh daughter take you as your own child. &gt;&gt; And I instruct you home. &gt;&gt; Good teacher. &gt;&gt; Church that is the church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That is what we do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We do a good job at it. &gt;&gt; Yes. I teach you that you are not Pharaoh child. &gt;&gt; You are my child. &gt;&gt; I God inspired us &gt;&gt; to build an arm that child but crocodile can come near you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I put you in the water. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You are God's purpose. &gt;&gt; You have a purpose. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And what coconite need anybody &gt;&gt; there? Somebody say get over this cargo. Amen. &gt;&gt; This piece of cargo is special. &gt;&gt; This is a special cargo. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God looking over this chap ministry &gt;&gt; and things are so nice. Amen. We know we know the story. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pharaoh daughter want him. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh daughter took him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He got into Pharaoh house &gt;&gt; and the devil was stupid. Devil's fool. &gt;&gt; The devil is &gt;&gt; the devil gave Pharaoh. Pharaoh um Moses mother money &gt;&gt; to raise up the man who go beat him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was afraid the devil too much may give too much praise. &gt;&gt; God has a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a purpose. So this chap come and he grew up there and mother taught him nice things. as every mother ought to do. &gt;&gt; But mother teaching cannot &gt;&gt; judge teaching. &gt;&gt; Cannot help it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I I would like to believe a lot of us here um do a little bit of farming. you look at a new generation rainfor technological society. So imagine I watching a sit at people who look like me and I go to talk about something and they may not even know why talking about &gt;&gt; I'm in a bad state. But let me tell you one time. &gt;&gt; Okay. When your young men be rare animals, &gt;&gt; right? And um the ducks who always the chicken sorry &gt;&gt; they lay egg &gt;&gt; but stupid me and stupid you don't know a duck and a hen could lay. They are lean machine &gt;&gt; but not because they lay they could hatch. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In case you don't know what I'm talking about. Hey, &gt;&gt; so in the long time neighborhood, you have no fences. &gt;&gt; So if the neighbor have a or drink, &gt;&gt; there's a meeting. &gt;&gt; It has to be a jewized air. &gt;&gt; Not because the f could lay. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You're going to get chicken. &gt;&gt; You get the &gt;&gt; not because the duck can lay and she can lay like a stretch on the end. &gt;&gt; But there's 28 days or 30 days. All you do is warm in the air. Yes. &gt;&gt; Keeping the egg warm &gt;&gt; for hatching. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But that egg is not &gt;&gt; there's not a German life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So poor you and me. &gt;&gt; You said we had 28 doctors. &gt;&gt; Things going good. &gt;&gt; 15 doctors, 16 doctors. &gt;&gt; You know there's a my memory can't tell me now, but there's a certain amount of time. The time pass, &gt;&gt; nothing going on, &gt;&gt; but this dog's still there. &gt;&gt; He stated that he dead &gt;&gt; warming that egg. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But that egg is not gated. &gt;&gt; He's not a fertilized egg. &gt;&gt; So the owner ourselves say by time going by something got to be wrong. &gt;&gt; Two things I'll tell you what happened. One the eggs are now stink. &gt;&gt; Back home we call it ganda egg. &gt;&gt; If it bust the stink of the whole place. &gt;&gt; Sometime in church people behave in a certain way. &gt;&gt; You thought you had egg &gt;&gt; but it's ganda egg you have. &gt;&gt; You can't be Christian. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't join a church to make you Christian. &gt;&gt; There has to be a relationship. &gt;&gt; Are you getting the &gt;&gt; There must be a relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. To create that egg. &gt;&gt; That egg. And the revealed word is &gt;&gt; not the church. &gt;&gt; The most revelated church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not the greatest pastor. &gt;&gt; Not the greatest preacher. You put up and you still produce &gt;&gt; ganda. [Music] I feel sorry I had to watch people like and um graph me because all having duck and f and this new age don't do nothing &gt;&gt; all having a computer &gt;&gt; you know we live in a new age &gt;&gt; only woke from here &gt;&gt; all right so I trust God you get the point &gt;&gt; the point is there must be a relationship &gt;&gt; amen Yes, &gt;&gt; the church is the dock. &gt;&gt; The church, my prophet tell me the church creates an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Atmosphere, &gt;&gt; we create the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; But you, me has to meet the person. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. So with all Moses great &gt;&gt; teaching &gt;&gt; the best &gt;&gt; from his mom &gt;&gt; true teaching is exactly correct &gt;&gt; just as this message is exactly correct &gt;&gt; very true exactly correct &gt;&gt; mother gave everything &gt;&gt; but what did he produce &gt;&gt; a ganda egg &gt;&gt; you want to know what the egg was &gt;&gt; a stinking Egyptian &gt;&gt; he killed Egyptian and you run and hide. &gt;&gt; Knowledge does not bring forth life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, it's good to know the message. &gt;&gt; It's good to &gt;&gt; I want to to make the point clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To make the point clear. &gt;&gt; If anybody believe in church is me, &gt;&gt; right? I want to show off. I am not the pastor who want to come to church because I want to see you. &gt;&gt; Since I born, I come to church. Since I'm born again, &gt;&gt; I come to church. &gt;&gt; I come to church without even see the coat. You're supposed to come to church even if I don't feel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the wrong thing is not coming to church. &gt;&gt; Coming to church is the greatest thing we could do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The greatest thing we could do is to come to church. &gt;&gt; But make sure &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't come to this four walls. &gt;&gt; Make sure I ain't come just to have fellowship with you. with all your fellowship nice time we could have together. &gt;&gt; I must have a relationship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; because the same Moses &gt;&gt; the same Moses &gt;&gt; thinking Egyptian run and hide. &gt;&gt; But one day &gt;&gt; he met the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; One day &gt;&gt; he met the person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. mother &gt;&gt; was telling him about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So just knowing, &gt;&gt; sorry, don't get offended. &gt;&gt; We all love the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just knowing the message &gt;&gt; does not do the story. &gt;&gt; Heat the person of the message. &gt;&gt; That is what will in our life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed and praise be to his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So our Lord told him, Peter, flesh and blood. See where you &gt;&gt; all the rebuke you get all the things you did &gt;&gt; but that statement you make that you know that's tremendous statement that inspired statement that you make &gt;&gt; you know how you boast out there talking you know now it's he time to talk &gt;&gt; who do you say &gt;&gt; said but Abraham say it come like you was speaking in tongues &gt;&gt; thou art the Christ &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; Peter, what Peter was saying, nobody, let me get a little in case you even Jesus didn't tell him that. &gt;&gt; You get the thought. &gt;&gt; Preachers can't tell you that. &gt;&gt; Jesus never tell Peter that. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood &gt;&gt; did not tell you that. &gt;&gt; When we go through the process, You'll realize power is in revelation. &gt;&gt; There is power in revelation. &gt;&gt; There's no power in knowledge. &gt;&gt; There's no power in knowing the message. &gt;&gt; Sorry, &gt;&gt; I forgive me but don't mess with me. The truth will remain as truth. There's no power in knowing the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got that message got to be revealed. &gt;&gt; All right. We can we can say it a little better. I might want to show you I'm the most revelated people most of the world. &gt;&gt; I am revelated. I know all any any questions you want to ask me. I'm the most revelator. &gt;&gt; But what about if the revelation I have hasn't is not produced in our life? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you getting the thought? Yes. &gt;&gt; If the more revelated I am &gt;&gt; is the greater life I ought to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't have revelation without testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That one is knowledge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And knowledge get you big headache. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So God's prophet was expounding &gt;&gt; you know we like to take what he prophets see and expound it &gt;&gt; but himself expound this he say you know Peter did not get this revelation by prayer &gt;&gt; he did not get it by saying a prayer &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; he did not get it by going to church. Lord have mercy. I am only quoting the prophet and look at it. &gt;&gt; Peter did not get the revelation by going to church. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean you mustn't come to church. &gt;&gt; Don't let a devil tell you what I never see. &gt;&gt; People always like to hear what you never see. &gt;&gt; You don't get it by coming to church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. But you have to come to church and receive it. Because God have ordained men here &gt;&gt; to quicken something to you. &gt;&gt; They cannot give it to you. &gt;&gt; But they can quicken something in the word to you that oh Lord that is me. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord I see it. I see it. I see it. &gt;&gt; Sit down right in church and you say I see it. You know what I mean? I get the revelation. &gt;&gt; I see it. &gt;&gt; He He can't make me see it. Yes, &gt;&gt; I see it. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. &gt;&gt; God open to your heart by his matchless grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not by saying a prayer. &gt;&gt; It's not by going to church. It's not by mother or father. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Neither is it by preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Peter, you know what you're saying? It is a direct revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; A direct revelation come from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter, what you say there? And I sometime end up with those treacherous waters, right? But what what what God's prophet said, that is the direct evidence that God called you, Peter. &gt;&gt; Yes. that that that you say who Jesus Christ is is the direct evidence &gt;&gt; that God called you. &gt;&gt; You ain't call yourself. &gt;&gt; Nobody ain't call you. &gt;&gt; It is revealed to you &gt;&gt; that Christ is the emancipator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to flesh and blood. Has God revealed it? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It is a revelation. &gt;&gt; And the truth be told, revelation is sovereign. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation is sovereign. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Right here. &gt;&gt; And God &gt;&gt; is given by God. &gt;&gt; Yes. So that we we preachers are so good. We like to teach people revelation. &gt;&gt; Very nice. Good intention. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me give a little example. &gt;&gt; You remember king bring a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And eel bring a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Okay. Here it goes. Of course, we know we we know we have our understanding there. But Cain was one and Abel one. &gt;&gt; And God accept Abel's sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And because God accept Abel's sacrifice, his brother kill. &gt;&gt; I said this brother kill him. &gt;&gt; Right. his brother half brother you know we don't we know not the brother right &gt;&gt; but that man kill him &gt;&gt; you see the you see the power revelation &gt;&gt; now when Abel carried the lamb &gt;&gt; mother didn't tell him &gt;&gt; he didn't have a preacher to tell him power church &gt;&gt; he didn't have no Bible to tell him &gt;&gt; are you seeing revelation &gt;&gt; he had no Bible &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; he had no to &gt;&gt; tell him. &gt;&gt; Nobody could have offered him. &gt;&gt; It was revealed to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What gave place in the garden of Eden &gt;&gt; that he brought &gt;&gt; the correct &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The king had no revelation. As a matter of fact, I had one. If you're not God, you don't have no revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; King of Satan child. &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not. &gt;&gt; God have sons and the devil have children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All of them being church. &gt;&gt; All of them religious. &gt;&gt; But God had children. devil. &gt;&gt; You want to get you want to get a nice one about &gt;&gt; King was so much the devil China &gt;&gt; that even God couldn't change him. &gt;&gt; Go back and read your Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Go back and read your Bible. &gt;&gt; God say look &gt;&gt; your revelation come by your eyes. &gt;&gt; Revelation come &gt;&gt; from the preacher. Yeah, &gt;&gt; hope we can't change nobody. &gt;&gt; God couldn't change. &gt;&gt; God tell him, "Hey, look." It's all right. All right. The balance is still good. A matter of fact, that happened for us. In case anybody falling asleep, God tell him watch what he did. Your eyes will open. God &gt;&gt; God saying I love what Abel do. &gt;&gt; I accept what do &gt;&gt; and that devil would not do it. &gt;&gt; It was preached to him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It would. So it's not pastors want to feel that we could change people have hope. &gt;&gt; You can't change their bodies. &gt;&gt; You could give them the word. &gt;&gt; You could present the truth to them &gt;&gt; but you cannot change them. And you see the great mystery, revelation did not come from nobody. &gt;&gt; That was the first church, you know. &gt;&gt; Not this one. That was the first church. &gt;&gt; So see the first church, there's a quotation. The beginning of righteousness was revelation. &gt;&gt; Right? There's where righteousness begin. &gt;&gt; The beginning of righteousness &gt;&gt; was revelation. It wasn't because and even when God tell the man you know the next thing after go after he refuse to do what God tell him to do even God tell it to you know so sometimes we could you could go through the message and refuse to follow the message &gt;&gt; you seeing what the word say &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; all that is telling me about my genetics &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Where it come from. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who am I? &gt;&gt; Yes. See exactly what it is. &gt;&gt; But it went further &gt;&gt; in that. &gt;&gt; You're done taking it. &gt;&gt; God preached to you. &gt;&gt; God preach. God is still preaching. &gt;&gt; God still preaching the people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What that church is God is preaching to you. &gt;&gt; The pastor is only a vessel. &gt;&gt; Yes. Let me say an easy and a hard one. Any preacher who stay with the word is God preaching to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you know this pulpit is the nearest place to heaven? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The right pulpit, a pulpit to stay with the word. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Yes to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] Sometime you know we kind of look down upon our pastors look down upon ministers and think them see this fellow on the pit is an angel you know &gt;&gt; amen with the word dot and t of the word that's an angel of God &gt;&gt; you know you remember the scripture said don't an angel come from heaven and say anything contrary &gt;&gt; people up here more power. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. I just a little extra for those who like to eat with that will take care of people who like to frown on the ministry and but let me get back with K. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So after God talked to K and you you could see spirits. God tell what I'm going to do. You do the same thing. &gt;&gt; The man do it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Instead of do it, he destroy &gt;&gt; the man. Kill the man. &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we got to examine ourselves, what what kind of spirit happen to be in us? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What what kind of spirit happen with us? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because anytime you want to destroy the man is a kale spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. I'm still one more minute with it now. So, here it is. He kill God now talking to him. &gt;&gt; Where is my brother? &gt;&gt; He have God. He ask my brother. Am I my brother's keeper? M &gt;&gt; that demon so call it the greatest confrontation God ever had. &gt;&gt; Can confront God as my brother? &gt;&gt; Am I my brother keeper? &gt;&gt; So you see what what a lack of revelation take you to. &gt;&gt; Amen. So revelation doesn't come as I said because who you are. Revelation comes from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you could only receive a revelation because God permit it. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; You will. We going to thank God. &gt;&gt; We got so much to thank God for. &gt;&gt; We got so much to praise God for. &gt;&gt; That God has revealed to us &gt;&gt; how to worship him. Yes. &gt;&gt; God has revealed to us &gt;&gt; how to live. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there are people and there are people just like us, &gt;&gt; right? But they don't have it. &gt;&gt; But revelation only come. &gt;&gt; Amen. As God peritted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; So let it be known flesh and blood never amen &gt;&gt; allow you to have it. This is not a family matter. &gt;&gt; This is not a church matter. &gt;&gt; This is not a matter that somebody tell you. Amen. This is not a matter that you know Peter get kind of woke up now. You know you know you could be in the house of God and you get so infused and you start to see all kind of thing. Even we as preachers, you know, sometimes you got to be careful. You could face the anointing. &gt;&gt; You know, you feel real anointed. I feel good. &gt;&gt; But you got to make sure you see come from the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the anointed you have. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It had wrong anointing to it. &gt;&gt; So get back yourself together and make sure you're saying is in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Peter did not get that. Amen. In any of these fashion &gt;&gt; flesh and blood has not give this to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is what a revelation is. A revelation is something that God give to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed art thou &gt;&gt; Simon Batona. My father which is in heaven &gt;&gt; has revealed this to you. &gt;&gt; So what it is? It is a spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; The message Christ the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay before I go there a little bit take I don't want to go too fast. Uh the second quote it come from who is this mech confirming that thought about revelation &gt;&gt; who yeah thank you you remember how we read the scripture so revelation is not him that will &gt;&gt; or him that runth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it is God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not him that will. Not him that runth but God. and that his predestination might stand true. &gt;&gt; He could choose before anything. &gt;&gt; God is sovereign in his choosing. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Nobody could tell God who to order. &gt;&gt; Nobody could tell God who to choose. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's prophet continued, "Who was back there to tell him a better way to make the world?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who would dare tell him he was running his business wrong? &gt;&gt; So even the very word itself &gt;&gt; is sovereign. &gt;&gt; Revelation is sovereign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He reveals to whom he revealed. &gt;&gt; The very revelation is sovereign. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, that's why God's prophet said that's how people pong at things. &gt;&gt; They jump at things. They hit things not knowing what they're doing. &gt;&gt; Revelation, didn't the word say so? The word said he hides from the wise &gt;&gt; and fool. &gt;&gt; That's what the word said. &gt;&gt; So, we could fight about we said this is this and that is that and that is that. If God hide it from you, you could never find it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He reveals to whom he revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how people p at things and jump at things and hit a thing not knowing what they're doing. God is sovereign in his word. &gt;&gt; That is what the Lord was telling Peter. Peter, you see you see this not a disciple. This is something God open up to you. Yes. &gt;&gt; He hides from the wise and &gt;&gt; God does do things to confuse people. &gt;&gt; God blinds people. &gt;&gt; If you could see, praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God confess people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He hide from the wise and prudent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And reveal to babes. That's why God's prophet tell you better be a baby. &gt;&gt; This is one time it better be a baby. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Better be a baby. &gt;&gt; Consider yourself a baby. &gt;&gt; Consider yourself you know nothing. &gt;&gt; That is how God could show you something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Consider yourself be a predestinated baby &gt;&gt; because predestinated babies is the one to receive it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints, you can't get anything from God &gt;&gt; purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can't get anything from God. Feel that you are know it all. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No. Be submissive to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be submissive to God. To receive from God. All right. Let's get Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 296. Amen. And amen. And amen. Quote number three. Christ the mystery of God revealed. Good. Correct. They he was referring to theologians and the teachers in the Bible and Bible school. They cannot know nothing about it. &gt;&gt; It is impossible for them to know anything about it. God has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers and everything else. &gt;&gt; It is personal. Yes. &gt;&gt; An individual affair with the person. &gt;&gt; There's nothing charged like a collective revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Big head people. &gt;&gt; We are the most revelated church. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Our church is the most revelated. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like collective revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation is an individual. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is an individual affair. Take for instance, &gt;&gt; you remember the Apostle Paul. &gt;&gt; He never met Jesus. &gt;&gt; Never met Jesus. &gt;&gt; And he encountered with the fellows that met Jesus. &gt;&gt; Say, you know, I walk with brother, you know. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I was there when he maybe end up with a jacket that came and a pants like him and a belt like him. &gt;&gt; You don't know message by following artifacts. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I was &gt;&gt; my my prophet tell me there was a lot of fellows was there too. But the children of Israel, anybody walk the road, they walk with Jesus. &gt;&gt; You remember Jesus walking plenty was walking and walk with Jesus. &gt;&gt; But that didn't make them a believer. &gt;&gt; Walking with the prophet don't make you a believer. &gt;&gt; Knowing the physical thing, my name all those not make you a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul power &gt;&gt; if you look upon revelation with Paul &gt;&gt; he's a &gt;&gt; dy &gt;&gt; he's a dy &gt;&gt; he's the one who kill and all kind of thing &gt;&gt; we walk with him &gt;&gt; we talk with him &gt;&gt; but you know something about Paul met him before he became Jesus &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; that doesn't come from no man &gt;&gt; Paul met him before He became flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You only know the flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The flesh of Jesus himself doesn't give life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Believe you got it. &gt;&gt; You see that in Christ the mystery of God revealed all of them. &gt;&gt; And then some of us so terrible. Yeah. We we people &gt;&gt; terrible. &gt;&gt; We like to make believers. &gt;&gt; And that's all we can do. Make make believe. [Music] &gt;&gt; We make them. &gt;&gt; Two days you come to church, we tell you how to dress. &gt;&gt; In all this, shoot the television. &gt;&gt; No, what you have on your pocket. Some have four television. All we telling people law. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't do this. &gt;&gt; Don't do that. dress. Can you don't get dressed also? &gt;&gt; Legalism &gt;&gt; the flesh. &gt;&gt; They giving the preacher a chance to preach the word &gt;&gt; and let the word clean the people. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I know the laws. I could tell you what what I have to do now &gt;&gt; that will dress in such a way &gt;&gt; that will do so and so &gt;&gt; you have to do this you have to do that &gt;&gt; no is the word has to wash the bride &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; the flesh the next thing the brother or sister trying to help you he backslide tomorrow &gt;&gt; he fall by the wayside &gt;&gt; but when you get a revelation the preacher backside you a move. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you getting the thought? &gt;&gt; You're not held by any man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody say tonight, I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; You got a pull from God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Give God the glory. Give him the praise. [Applause] So Paul there Paul had to put them in order you know but them could say I walk with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes &gt;&gt; I was there I saw so and so but Paul met the person. &gt;&gt; Yes &gt;&gt; before that person they met the flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The flesh can give you salvation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Paul meant the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Christ the mystery of God revealed. It's a personal individual affair with the person. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Christ is revealed to them. And this is the most glorious part of the church. This is glorious. This is it because as I share the quotations uh you do not allow clean worship, clean living and worship to die from the church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Everybody could sing. &gt;&gt; Everybody could shout. Everybody could dance. Everybody could jump. &gt;&gt; Right. But that is is two wings. One wing is clean living. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because worship without clean living is not worship. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; So here God's prophet was identifying Christ the mystery of God revealed. And if you say he's been revealed to me, right? He's revealed to me, you have a revelation and Christ is revealed to me and then the life that Christ produced here in the Bible, the same life is in them and it does not produce the same in you. You got the wrong revelation. [Music] &gt;&gt; So I must measure my revelation. [Music] &gt;&gt; Not like this. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Somebody sang a song. When he drop &gt;&gt; from my head &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; to my heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let that drop from your head to your heart &gt;&gt; and then action start. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed and praise be to the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; flesh and blood says my father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here it was. Oh Lord telling Peter, Peter, I did not reveal it to you. &gt;&gt; My life &gt;&gt; did not reveal it. So Jesus was making it point clear. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So tonight, a perfect revelation from God &gt;&gt; is what I must pray for. That is why God's prophet said, "Pray for revelation." &gt;&gt; Cry for revelation. &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation. &gt;&gt; A secondhanded revelation could never keep me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I striking to say things that something we preachers are careful to say. You know what I mean? I've been honest. You know what I mean? I think I be careful to say I could quote the prophet but if I'm not living it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If that is not me. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Then I am a revelation. &gt;&gt; I have knowledge. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; So let us make sure it is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here it was church. But the Apostle Peter really and truly did see him in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. The Apostle Peter, the Apostle Paul never knew him physically. &gt;&gt; So Paul knew him by revelation. &gt;&gt; But Peter did see him in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But the flesh tell him flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. So dividing something. &gt;&gt; Although I walk with you, &gt;&gt; I rough you up. &gt;&gt; All get the hands, &gt;&gt; get behind me, &gt;&gt; is not I reveal that you &gt;&gt; not Lord Jesus that we could open up our hearts. Pastors can't give revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I heard a pastor once tell me who give that to you. &gt;&gt; We pastors are given to arrogance at times. &gt;&gt; Yes. If you ever get something, you get it from a man. &gt;&gt; You know, I am the revelated one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or you could say you have that revelation. Who gave it to you? &gt;&gt; If I didn't give it to you, you can't have that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, you see there's a great truth God prophet tells us there not only for preachers to all of us all of us each and everyone no matter who you think you are sometime we can get too big for ourselves &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; God's prophet the good one check the quote God have a hard time &gt;&gt; God have a hard time preachers &gt;&gt; and congregation when he bless you to keep you humble. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hey, who you managing the computer? You see a code for me like like they believe me? Please help me. God has a hard time. &gt;&gt; Somebody here believe you. I'm feeling a rebound. God does have a hard time. &gt;&gt; Let God bless us &gt;&gt; instead of be giving praise to God &gt;&gt; and be giving thanks to God. &gt;&gt; Even if I give you vote, you're going to find it. &gt;&gt; You find it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I like workers like you, brother. God bless you. A time I preaching something you know when I preach it somebody here for the first time &gt;&gt; and they were bold enough say &gt;&gt; you know when the fellow on the screen here now me ask him for you put it up &gt;&gt; to show that that know &gt;&gt; when he say he see your opinion look at this &gt;&gt; put it down record it Keep that. No matter how small, whether you're a believer, you're a deacon, you're some leader, you're a preacher, God has a hard time trying to get somebody he can deal with &gt;&gt; that will stay humble. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And meek &gt;&gt; and stay in the place until God call him to do something. &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen. A man that God can bless &gt;&gt; and he could keep himself a man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Somebody from Hindu um I show somebody from Hindu background. So &gt;&gt; yeah my feet or something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So man wants worship. &gt;&gt; Don't fool yourself. I like to feel like the best thing in the world. &gt;&gt; God want you to &gt;&gt; bow to me. &gt;&gt; I am it. &gt;&gt; Look at there. A man that God can bless and he will still keep himself a man and not be an angel &gt;&gt; or God. &gt;&gt; As soon as man get blessed and has something given to him, he wants to become a god. Yes. &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not, you see me all that we want worship. &gt;&gt; Be honest with yourself. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So don't like praise. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We don't like praise. &gt;&gt; We like people say nice thing about &gt;&gt; if you handle that correctly is worship you're looking for. &gt;&gt; I could still come back here for sure.

Thank God for blessing you. &gt;&gt; Thank God for our pastor. &gt;&gt; Thank God for servant of God. &gt;&gt; You know okay I tell our church this this this way. This is I don't give a partner trouble. Look at it. &gt;&gt; Some the congregation set the pastor for a fall. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; The church will set you for a fall. &gt;&gt; God does not share his glory with nobody. &gt;&gt; So I used to tell them back home, don't set me up. &gt;&gt; Don't make me feel like the best thing that I ever had. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God is the best. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God give you a pastor. God give you a ministry. Thank God for it. &gt;&gt; Don't go carry it no way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Humble yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because &gt;&gt; All right. All right. This is a quote too. God will make your pastor backslide. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For you to take your eye out of him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Am I saying something contrary? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Correct. Because people's worship man &gt;&gt; God don't share his worship with anyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All worship belong to God. &gt;&gt; You praise God for a ministry. Praise God for the blessings he have shared. But don't give a man what he &gt;&gt; and we sing. All the glory. &gt;&gt; All the glory belong to the Lord. &gt;&gt; All the praise belong to the Lord. If I'm ever anything, all the praise to him. my brain. Let us praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; But please, you know, I say this way. Don't set me up for a fall &gt;&gt; because I will fall as all you who set me up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Love me. Pray for me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; But don't tell anybody I my pastor is the best man of the sun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Stupidness. Bless &gt;&gt; God thinking that &gt;&gt; God is sharing his glory with no man. &gt;&gt; As soon as the man get blessed and has a little something given to him, he want to become a god. &gt;&gt; He want to become an angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember Nebuchadnezzar? &gt;&gt; You see what I had done? &gt;&gt; You know want to show the kingdom I have. &gt;&gt; See what I have done. God vexed that spirit boy. God turn into animal. But idol, we supposed to thank God, but God has allowed to use us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the Lord to be a vessel &gt;&gt; to be just to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; You know that song from Benton just to be a blessing. You tell tell your friend that teach you a good song. Teach a good song. That's one of my favorite singers, a preacher, a singing preacher from the same church, &gt;&gt; you know, missionary man. And that you must go and look at listen to it. A wonderful song and he all way go through the missionary field and what you do, you do it just to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Just to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; So tell what I say. Give you a good song from Jack &gt;&gt; just to be a blessing from Jackie. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So my father which is in heaven has give it unto you. We can only receive revelation as God permit it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So revelation is not knowledge. &gt;&gt; That's right. Revelation is not a mental conception. &gt;&gt; We have knowledge, &gt;&gt; right? But revelation is not mental conception. Revelation is something that is spiritual. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And is built upon the revelation on the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it upon this revelation is a divine revelation of who? Jesus is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I say unto you, Amen. I say unto you, &gt;&gt; that thou art Peter, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And upon this rock, &gt;&gt; I will build my church. &gt;&gt; The Catholic say that rock is Peter. &gt;&gt; Because the very name Peter mean a little stone. It mean a little rock. But imagine all the nice boy Peter is Peter back. &gt;&gt; Peter backlid &gt;&gt; immediately after. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Immediately after he made that profound statement. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Immediately after he said that great revelation, &gt;&gt; he backslid. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. He cursed. &gt;&gt; One of them he [Music] &gt;&gt; c said I don't know the man. He deny the master. &gt;&gt; So you could think about a church built on a man like that. &gt;&gt; Church is not built upon a man. &gt;&gt; It's not built upon a man. &gt;&gt; Peter was an unstable man. Church can't build on any man born in sin and shaped in liberty. &gt;&gt; Come into the world telling lies. &gt;&gt; So the Lord is saying upon this rock &gt;&gt; Peter. It is not built upon Peter. &gt;&gt; Neither is it built upon the Lord Jesus Christ. upon this rock. &gt;&gt; The Pentecostals, God's prophet identified to us. This is Bill of Christ, the cornerstone. &gt;&gt; No, it was not built upon himself, &gt;&gt; but upon Peter's revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Upon Peter's revelation &gt;&gt; of who Jesus is, &gt;&gt; upon this rock, &gt;&gt; the church is built. &gt;&gt; Upon this rock, what rock? Spiritual revealed truth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We thank God for the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank God. You all have some bright chaps here. They're doing good. Congratulations, brother. Show them these things, right? It's right there. &gt;&gt; Nobody protestants say it's a revelation. Read it that way. Flesh and blood had not revealed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be upon this rock. &gt;&gt; What is the rock? The rock is the revelation &gt;&gt; of who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; What did the psalmist David said? He said, "God is my rock." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is my revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what we live this life by. &gt;&gt; Let God be your revelation. &gt;&gt; God is my rock. &gt;&gt; I am here. &gt;&gt; Because God is revealed to me. &gt;&gt; God has made himself known to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That man cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That brother cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; That sister cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; Because if God had made himself known to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The revelation of the word &gt;&gt; is my rock. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Upon this rock. &gt;&gt; This rock I will build my church. &gt;&gt; That church is built upon a true revelation of the word. The church is built upon a revelation of who Jesus is. Yes. &gt;&gt; Who Jesus is in this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on, message. &gt;&gt; You're not who Jesus is yesterday. &gt;&gt; You're not who Jesus is at that time, but who Jesus is now. &gt;&gt; Church is built upon that revelation, &gt;&gt; spiritual revealed truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; God builds his church &gt;&gt; upon spiritual revealed truth alone. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My father, he tells us which is in heaven &gt;&gt; has revealed this unto you. &gt;&gt; A spiritual revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Spiritual revealed truth, a divine revelation. [Music] Don't you thank God tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you give God praise? &gt;&gt; Don't you give God this glory upon this rock? &gt;&gt; So, you are invited tonight. &gt;&gt; Hold fast. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hold fast &gt;&gt; to the rock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Hold fast to the rock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The written word spiritually revealed. &gt;&gt; Not the letter of the word, but the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Hold fast to the rock. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we write down by the grace of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, I'm just going to read some quotations to you and just take our time by God's grace. Amen. And amen. Hallelujah. I think um blessed be the name of the Lord. I Okay, let me just share this with you. Uh the message indictment, &gt;&gt; you going to look for revelation. M &gt;&gt; God's prophet said all right uh &gt;&gt; okay good good they don't dig down deep enough &gt;&gt; to get into the spirit of revelation &gt;&gt; pray for revelation &gt;&gt; pray revelation is given by God &gt;&gt; he said we don't dig down deep enough. &gt;&gt; We don't pray enough. &gt;&gt; We don't call upon God enough. &gt;&gt; 266. They just take it lightly. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, I believe there's a God. Sure. &gt;&gt; The devil believes the same thing. &gt;&gt; So, it's not enough to believe there's a God. &gt;&gt; The devil believes the same thing. And the devil believe more than some of us who claim to believe because the word say the devil believe and tremble. &gt;&gt; Are we all right? &gt;&gt; People just believe and go on. &gt;&gt; The devil trembles knowing there's a judgment ahead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does God change his mind about his word? &gt;&gt; Paragraph 79 is in front of me. But Abel, we spoke about Cain and Abel. God's prophets are identifying in his hand. Does God change his mind about his word? But Abel had the right sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it was the blood. He realized what take place in the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; He had a revelation. Nobody tell him what happened. &gt;&gt; He had a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he brought a lamb. &gt;&gt; And when God received his now Abel by faith, &gt;&gt; by revelation, no other way. There was no Bible written. &gt;&gt; So you see the beginning of righteousness is God's revealed truth. &gt;&gt; And the entire church is built upon it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I cannot make myself righteous. &gt;&gt; You cannot make yourself righteous. &gt;&gt; The beginning of righteousness is God's revealed &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Amen. Revelation of Jesus Christ, page 15, paragraph 3. Amen. But the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit would come into the church &gt;&gt; and defile it. &gt;&gt; And make it lukewarm, &gt;&gt; formal, &gt;&gt; and powerless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The book of Revelation exposes Satan. Yes. &gt;&gt; Exposes, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; revealing his work as an attempted destruction of God's people &gt;&gt; by discrediting God's word right down to the time he's cast in the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; He cannot stand it. &gt;&gt; God's prophecy tells us something here that the devil knows. &gt;&gt; He knows &gt;&gt; if the people get the true revelation. [Applause] Amen. If the people get the true revelation, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; of the true church. &gt;&gt; And what she is &gt;&gt; and what she stand for, &gt;&gt; she can do the greater work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She will be &gt;&gt; an in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She will be an invincible enemy. &gt;&gt; Nobody could conquer her. &gt;&gt; Nobody can conquer you. Say &gt;&gt; nobody can conquer you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll remain victorious &gt;&gt; with a true revelation. &gt;&gt; If the people get the true revelation of the true church &gt;&gt; and what she is and what she stands for, she can do the bigger work. She will be an invincible army &gt;&gt; if they get the true revelation of the two spirits. &gt;&gt; The antichrist spirit say in the framework of the church and God's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit. Satan will be powerless &gt;&gt; before her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will be definitely thwarted &gt;&gt; as when Christ withtood his every effort &gt;&gt; to gain power over him. &gt;&gt; Satan hates revelation. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Satan loves church. &gt;&gt; Satan loves the church. &gt;&gt; He loves church. &gt;&gt; He loves that. But you know what the scripture telling the power &gt;&gt; this is the most religious age &gt;&gt; the world has &gt;&gt; everybody &gt;&gt; have a form of religion &gt;&gt; but they deny the power &gt;&gt; the power to is revelation &gt;&gt; power to walk right is revelation &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; Satan hates revelation But we love it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We love it. &gt;&gt; With true revelation, &gt;&gt; the gates of hell &gt;&gt; shall never &gt;&gt; shall never say coming. &gt;&gt; It didn't say the gates of hell wouldn't come. &gt;&gt; But rest assured, &gt;&gt; the gates of hell will never &gt;&gt; We are challenged tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are challenged tonight. &gt;&gt; We're overcoming power. &gt;&gt; Overcoming grace, &gt;&gt; it comes from a revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Of your message. &gt;&gt; A revelation of the word for this day. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And who who can give it us is almighty God. &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation. &gt;&gt; Cry out to God for revelation. &gt;&gt; Seek revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we close with this 134 quote number four. The importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer &gt;&gt; can never be over. &gt;&gt; Revelation, &gt;&gt; amen, means more to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Than perhaps you &gt;&gt; he said I'm not talking about the book of Revelation. I am talking about all revelation. &gt;&gt; It is tremendously &gt;&gt; important. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Dan, I appreciate you. &gt;&gt; It will never be the same. &gt;&gt; This is my third visit. Maybe till this perfection or something, &gt;&gt; but I have really been blessed. &gt;&gt; Enjoy the time of fellowship. enjoy the hospitality of the ministers &gt;&gt; and we can say we had a glorious time. &gt;&gt; It is the prayer of our hearts that we as I tell my brother I love that song just to be a blessing. If during these services things were said to encourage you to love the Lord better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To serve him better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To support the ministry &gt;&gt; to pray for your pastor. Then my ministry will be a blessing. God bless you pastor. [Applause] Amen. Flesh and blood has not revealed it to us. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. But our father has revealed it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the farmer that told the chicken that told that eagle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was mama eagle flying in the &gt;&gt; That revealed to that eaglet &gt;&gt; that he wasn't a chicken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The other chickens didn't reveal it to him. &gt;&gt; Hey, you built different.

I sent it to you. You can just put that up. Amen. Let's stand together. You appreciate the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just get into a time of worship. Prophet tells us, Amen. After the preaching of the word and a message like this, Amen. We should be so thankful &gt;&gt; that God has revealed it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus told them, &gt;&gt; "It is given to you to know the mysteries &gt;&gt; of the kingdom, &gt;&gt; but to them it is not given. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So many may have desired to look into these glorious things. &gt;&gt; But it's whom the Lord had chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says in the message the rapture, it is a revelation. &gt;&gt; For the revelation is faith. &gt;&gt; You cannot have a revelation without it being faith. &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation &gt;&gt; because it's something that's revealed to you. Yes. &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham &gt;&gt; that could call anything contrary &gt;&gt; to what has been revealed to him as though it wasn't so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what faith is. The revelation of God. The church is built upon revelation. The whole entire body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing. He's here. Elijah's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's no longer God above us.

But if you are free to believe it, &gt;&gt; even now your need shall be met. &gt;&gt; Even now your prayer shall be answered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even now your loved one &gt;&gt; can come to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's according to your faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can raise your hand if you have a need. &gt;&gt; And I'm believing the Lord is going to meet you at the point of your need. &gt;&gt; What is the preaching for?
