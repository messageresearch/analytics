TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and tonight we're starting on the sixth chapter of Revelation now as we study this chapter we're referring different places even to Old and New Testament alike because the entire book is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen that's all together the revelation of of the Lord Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ it's God revealing himself in the book revealing himself through Christ in the book and Christ is the revelation of God Amen he come to reveal God because he and God were the same God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself you see the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world Amen this book The Bible was really written before the foundation of the world and Christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the the members of his bride their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundational world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names were in there all about it what a great thing and there about 12:00 in the day the Holy Spirit just swept right down into the room and the whole thing is opened up to me there of this of this first seal being open I'm as positive as I'm standing here tonight that this is the gospel truth that I'm going to say now we find the Lamb with the book now and now in the sixth chapter we read and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of a thunder and one of the four Beast saying Comm and seat and I saw and behold a white horse and he is set on him at a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer but it isn't this kind of a book it's a scroll and then when the scroll is Unwound that's one that land right in the scroll is number two and right here says what it is but it's a mystery so a revelation is something that's made known of something something that's been revealed and now notice so you once forget it it is closed up until the latter [Music] time the whole mystery of it is closed up until the latter times we find that in the scripture here now the mystery of the book are revealed when the seals are broken and when the seals completely are broken the time of redemption is over because the lamb left the intercession boat to walk out to take his clean he was a mediator between that but when the real Revelation happens on the seals as they begin to break the lamb is coming forth from the sanctuary now he said there is a white harsh Rider but what the mystery of it is there a mystery that goes with that Rider now what it was they didn't know but it's to be revealed and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seed wonder what that Thunder was St John 12 chapter and just hold it a minute St John the 12th chapter when the Thunder remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is a voice of God the first seal when it was open in the symol form it thunder and what about when it's open this reality form it's thundered as soon as the lamb struck back to Sea and what did it reveal not all of itself first it's to God next it's in the symol then it's reveal three things and only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church oh my that just makes me tremble I'm on a thunder trap no doubt John might have jumped up in the air one of Thunder roared and then one of the four people he said now come see what it is what's revealed the [Music] oh John write what you see so John goes to look see what it was John goes to see what the Thunder said it's then that this creature told John come see what the mystery is under the first seal the Thunder the voice of the creator has uttered it now what does this White Horse me and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given him he didn't have it then unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now what does the white horse mean now here's where the Revelation com but my Revelation by the holy spirit is not that way my Revelation by the holy spirit is Christ and and the Holy Spirit is the self-signed person owning a different farm so here stands Christ the lamb we know he was the lamb he stand here at the books in his hand and there goes the white horse rider so it wasn't the Holy Spirit and so how could Christ be out there the White Horse conquering and standing here with a book in his hand it isn't th it isn't Christ notice now the holy spirit in the Revelation and Christ is the holy spirit is Christ in another form right notice it is the Lamb that open the books and the lamb is Christ and Christ is not seen anymore from then but he is seen in the Book of Revelations the 19th Chapter coming on a white heart amen and he that set on him was called faithful true righteous does he judge and make walk his eyes were flames of fire and on his head was many crowns look at the diadem and he had a name written that no man know but himself I noticed no man know but himself and he was clothed with the vesture di and blood and his name is called the word of God notice and the army which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he tread The Wine Press of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God and he had on his vesture and on his th a name written king of kings and Lord of lords there comes the Messiah there he is not this fellow on this horse back here notice the rider on the White Horse don't have any name you might used two three titles but he hasn't got any name but Christ has the name what is it the word of God in the beginning was the word the word is with God and the Word was God and the word made flesh the rer has no name but Christ is called the word of God who is this mysterious riter of the first church age you want me tell you who he is he's the Antichrist exactly what he is now because you see if an antichrist Jesus said that the two would be so close together and so it would deceive the very elected the bride if it was possible Antichrist it's the anti Christ Spirit Glory notice and when this holy spirit that we have becomes incarnate to us the one that's in our midst now in the form of the Holy Ghost becomes incarnate to us in the person of Jesus Christ we [Applause] [Music] King right what are we saying who is this Rider this horse rider you know what it is it's Satan's super educ this is a Satan Superman with education with wisdom with church Theology of his own word of his own making and he rides his white denominational horse to deceive the people and the Antichrist takes it all and the Bible said that he deceived all ainel am all upon the face of the Earth whose names were not written under those Shields from the now notice he'll conquer and almost has in his grip right now while he's still Antichrist before he can become Thief may be one thing that can conquer those that's got their names written in the L's Book of Life from the foundation of the world I notice and the same time this is going on just before this takes place rather on the earth God has promised while all them Scruples of denom minations arguing their difference about the Creed God promised that he would send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to return to the original word of God and the faith of the fathers to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people with a power that will raise her above these things and take her in don't forget it friend don't forget it take it home with you stay with it hold it on your pillar don't forget it stay with it [Music] God
