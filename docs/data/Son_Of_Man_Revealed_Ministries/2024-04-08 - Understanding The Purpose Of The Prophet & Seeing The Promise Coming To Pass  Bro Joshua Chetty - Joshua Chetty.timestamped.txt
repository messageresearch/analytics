[6:28] [Music]
[6:40] and the Lord said unto Samuel how
[6:43] long will thou mourn for
[6:46] Saul seeing I have rejected him from
[6:51] reigning over Israel yes amen fill thine
[6:55] on with oil and gold I will send thee to

[8:06] amen God will have to show him amen
[8:14] yes and he
[8:19] said and thou shallal anoint him whom I
[8:22] name unto thee and Samuel did that which
[8:24] the Lord spake and came to
[8:27] Bethlehem and the Elders of the the town
[8:30] trembled at his
[8:31] coming and said comest thou peacefully
[8:35] this is an anointed man of God Amen you

[8:39] when he's come he's going to rebuke he's
[8:41] going to chastise he's going to bring
[8:43] correction he's going to bring dust say
[8:44] the Lord he's not going to compromise
[8:45] with the word amen amen so he was
[8:49] respected for that because Samuel is
[8:50] working in full stature amen he's got
[8:52] all seven virtue with him amen he's a
[8:55] prophet of God for his age amen
[9:00] and you know a prophet is God to the

[9:39] Lord's service amen amen and he
[9:42] Sanctified Jesse and his sons and called
[9:44] them to the
[9:47] sacrifice and it came to pass when they
[9:50] were come that he looked at leab and
[9:53] said surely the Lord's anointed is
[9:55] before him amen but the Lord said unto
[9:58] Samuel not on his countenance amen
[10:01] praise the Lord on the height of his
[10:03] stature because I have refused him amen
[10:06] oh God is not interested in how how

[10:20] seeth for man lookth on the outward
[10:24] appearance but the Lord look at on the
[10:27] Arts amen amen then Jesse called
[10:32] Abad abinadab and made him pass before
[10:36] Samuel and he said neither had the Lord
[10:39] chosen him amen then Jesse made
[10:43] Shamar to pass
[10:45] by hey surely Samuel must have said hey
[10:48] this is something now he's got the name
[10:49] of the Lord with him the Lord is present
[10:51] before us amen thank you Lord he said
[10:54] even look at his name but he said
[10:56] neither had the Lord chosen this
[11:02] again Jesse made Seven of his sons to
[11:05] pass before
[11:07] Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse the
[11:10] Lord had not chosen these and Samuel
[11:15] said unto Jesse are you all thy
[11:18] children and he said they remain it yet
[11:22] the
[11:23] youngest all the 11 our workers
[11:27] amen and behold he with the Sheep yes
[11:30] and Samuel said unto Jesse send and
[11:33] fetch him yes for we will not sit down
[11:36] till he come hither yes
[11:39] amen you see that's in verse 11 yes amen
[11:43] amen and he sent and brought him
[11:47] in now he was
[11:50] ready and without all of a beautiful
[11:54] continence and goodly to look up and to
[11:56] look look to and the Lord said AR
[11:59] rise anoint him for this is
[12:04] he then Samuel took the oil oil of oil
[12:08] and anointed him in the midst of his
[12:10] Brethren amen and the spirit of the Lord
[12:14] Came Upon David from that day forward so
[12:18] Samuel rose up and went to R amen you
[12:20] may be seated
[12:22] am so he find that's the first anointing
[12:25] of David amen that's the first time
[12:28] David was
[12:30] anointed when the word of the
[12:34] Lord came to him by the prophet Samuel
[12:37] amen amen that was his the first
[12:39] anointing
[12:43] yes that was an anointing before his
[12:45] kingship amen amen anointed that you are
[12:47] now chosen that you are called out amen
[12:51] amen and that's how the message came to
[12:52] us amen the word came to the prophet and
[12:56] we caught the Revelation and we were
[12:57] called out amen and we received an
[13:00] anointing amen now we were told who we
[13:03] are amen
[13:05] thank we also go to the book of 1
[13:08] Chronicles
[13:12] 11 the book of 1 Chronicles
[13:19] 11 then all Israel gathered themselves
[13:22] to David unto Eon saying behold we are
[13:28] thy bone and thy
[13:31] flesh and moreover in time pass even
[13:35] when Saul was
[13:37] King thou was he that led us out and
[13:41] brought us in Israel and the Lord thy
[13:44] God said unto
[13:46] thee Thou shalt Feed My People Israel
[13:51] and thou shallal be ruler Over My People
[13:56] Israel therefore came all the Elders of
[13:59] Israel to the king to Eon and David made
[14:03] a covenant with them in Eon before the
[14:06] Lord and they anointed David King over
[14:11] Israel according to the word of the Lord
[14:14] by Samuel yes
[14:17] amen now what is said it will be the
[14:21] refilling of the Holy Ghost amen it be
[14:23] the Dynamics of this church will be what
[14:26] the refilling of the Holy Ghost so when
[14:29] you first anointed we had the
[14:31] mechanics we had the word to clean us up
[14:34] to get us to set our feet on Solid
[14:36] Ground amen but there had to come a time
[14:40] there had to be a changing of a season
[14:42] amen hallelujah she had to change from
[14:45] Saul Amen to another kingship amen yes
[14:49] there to be a changing of the Season
[14:51] before the Dynamics come down amen
[14:54] hallelujah and Saul was on a different
[14:58] tribe but David tribe come and Judah
[15:01] come from Judah amen and where do we
[15:04] come from the Royal seed amen amen we
[15:07] come from The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[15:10] amen we Anointed with the he anointing
[15:13] in this age because why we are living in
[15:15] a prophetic age but we come our original
[15:19] lineage come from the Royal seed amen
[15:21] amen we come from a kingly kingly
[15:23] lineage amen yes
[15:26] amen hallelujah yes
[15:29] so
[15:31] David David's anointed and he says yes
[15:34] so David Works greater and greater for
[15:36] the Lord of hosts was with
[15:39] him amen verse
[15:48] 9 open to 2 Samuel
[15:57] 5:1 and David went on and grew great and
[16:01] the Lord God of oost was with him amen
[16:05] amen
[16:06] amen so you can't stay the same you have
[16:10] to change from Glory unto glory amen
[16:15] amen because this word is not just come
[16:18] it's come for a purpose so I'm speaking
[16:20] this morning on understanding the
[16:23] purpose why the prophet came yes and
[16:26] seeing the prophecy coming to pass in
[16:28] our life amen amen there was a prophecy
[16:31] about us that there'll be this bride
[16:34] that will make a Rapture
[16:39] amen because God after we received this
[16:42] word god anointed us to confirm to his
[16:45] word to confirm to what the prophet was
[16:48] telling telling us was the truth amen
[16:51] God had to anoint us yes to believe that
[16:55] Amen to say what the prophet telling was
[16:57] the truth yes amen because many artists
[16:59] can receive this why they don't believe
[17:01] it but God had to anoint you to receive
[17:04] this amen amen but where your experience
[17:08] come
[17:09] from David experience wasn't coming in
[17:11] the palace he was not King as yet
[17:15] David's experience was coming in the
[17:16] wilderness amen every one of us have to
[17:20] have a back of the desert experience
[17:22] every son of daughter of God must be
[17:24] tried and tested oh when the trials are
[17:27] when the trials are coming don't say
[17:29] Lord take this burden away from me yes
[17:32] because now you that means you are
[17:34] quitting you don't want to be test
[17:37] remember God has put the tutor over us
[17:39] yes amen the tutor is there to give a
[17:42] report when we every test comes amen
[17:47] amen but say Lord rather say Lord in his
[17:51] time strengthen me Lord strengthen me to
[17:54] overcome Lord L Lord show me show me
[17:57] what I ought to do do according to your
[17:59] word Lord amen yes take me back to your
[18:02] word Lord and show me what the scripture
[18:04] says about the situation Lord
[18:06] amen
[18:10] amen so we find that we are we started
[18:13] to
[18:15] understand the purpose of why the
[18:18] prophet
[18:20] came the message God has placed us now
[18:23] we've come under the right baptism we
[18:25] has placed in the local assembly yes now
[18:28] you've got to comeand an
[18:30] assembly amen now many people will say
[18:34] no but I've got the messages and I'm
[18:35] listening to the messages but God has
[18:37] called a five Mery for a
[18:39] purpose now remember sheep cannot lead
[18:44] themselves if sheep are loone they will
[18:47] go astray if sheep are loaned the Wolves
[18:50] will attack them yes his sheep are alone
[18:54] they cannot find food for themselves
[18:56] they cannot feed themselves they got to
[18:58] be L to good pastures to Green Pastures
[19:01] they got to be led to the
[19:03] water amen hallelujah
[19:07] amen that's why God has sent Shepherds
[19:10] amen
[19:11] amen and then you began to understand
[19:15] the purpose now that God just he called
[19:18] us there and he began to deal with us
[19:20] that's why he placed Us in an assembly
[19:23] when you come in assembly and you come
[19:25] out from
[19:26] Egypt what happens you began to to now
[19:29] take
[19:29] off all the makeup out stop bobbing your
[19:33] hair start dressing up right start
[19:36] behaving like a Christian start talking
[19:39] proper
[19:40] language take away all your vulgarity
[19:42] amen stop all your things from the world
[19:45] Amen what was that the first pool
[19:48] contact In the Flesh amen amen that was
[19:52] your first pool contacting the flesh
[19:54] Amen in your local assembly amen
[19:57] right and then
[20:00] as the anointing started come and the
[20:03] power of the Holy Ghost in the church to
[20:04] the anointing because the Bible said we
[20:06] do not pre we do not come with enticing
[20:08] words but with power and demonstration
[20:10] of the Gospel amen so the gospel is
[20:13] preached with power and demonstration
[20:16] then what happened the word began to
[20:18] contact your spirits amen those demons
[20:20] that were hanging over you amen those
[20:24] demons of lust yes those demons from
[20:27] generations of those generation curses
[20:29] upon you was hanging over you maybe from
[20:32] your parents and so forth it was hanging
[20:34] over you then what happened became the
[20:38] second pool began to contact your spirit
[20:40] contact those demons through you and
[20:42] cast those demons out through the
[20:43] preaching of the words amen amen but now
[20:48] is a different season amen now is a
[20:51] season where the word to the Holy Ghost
[20:54] now is contacting your soul oh yes
[20:57] because Lord this is now Harvest Time
[21:00] and harvest time is at the end of the
[21:02] world because this is adoption time amen
[21:06] you are being tried and tested through
[21:08] your testing in the
[21:10] wilderness and the tutor was giving a
[21:12] good report but now you come to your
[21:14] adoption ceremony amen and it's the time
[21:17] for him to give a good report about you
[21:20] yes amen and now is the time to contact
[21:22] your soul whether you are truly
[21:25] believing the words or you are just
[21:27] there to set ify your conscience in the
[21:30] message of the
[21:31] hour because many people will be and I'm
[21:35] I'm I'm telling you this very seriously
[21:37] we got to evaluate Our Lives amen and
[21:40] see if we understanding the purpose of
[21:43] why God send His
[21:45] prophets God sent his Prophet so that he
[21:48] can bring people back to adoption again
[21:52] so that he can have his sons and
[21:53] daughters coming back to the original
[21:56] condition again amen amen because not
[21:59] remember we coming back as Kings and
[22:01] Priests but before you come King you got
[22:04] to come priest Hallelujah but Adam
[22:07] started off as king yes as dominion over
[22:10] the Earth so we are going back to what
[22:12] was started amen but we start from
[22:15] priests amen amen but Adam started a
[22:18] king but he ended up going to priests
[22:20] after the fall amen he was Priest when
[22:23] he was worshiping with his father when
[22:24] he was worshiping God and he was Priest
[22:27] even when he fell he knew that if he
[22:29] left Eve she would die so he stepped in
[22:32] the Mediterranean Road
[22:35] amen but we starting or we going from
[22:37] priest to kingship amen but between the
[22:41] priest to pries ship and the kingship do
[22:44] we understand the
[22:47] purpose hallelujah
[22:51] amen so we find
[22:55] that according to Romans 121 and2 it
[22:58] says
[22:59] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[23:02] mercies of God that ye present your
[23:05] bodies a Living Sacrifice amen holy
[23:09] acceptable unto God which is your
[23:12] reasonable
[23:14] service and be not conformed to this
[23:17] world Amen so already Paul is telling
[23:19] you about this world and then that why
[23:22] you talking about this world because
[23:23] there's also another world and there
[23:25] other worlds
[23:27] amen Enoch lived in another world Amen
[23:31] he lived on the other side of the flood
[23:33] it was another world yes amen and Enoch
[23:36] was a Serv from Adam yes amen and Enoch
[23:39] come into the full stature of a perfect
[23:41] man
[23:42] amen
[23:44] amen he not come into a position where
[23:47] he was the god man on the earth yes he
[23:50] was a he knew that Adam fell from this
[23:53] yeah Hallelujah it was revealed to Enoch
[23:56] that Adam fell from this condition amen
[23:59] and when it was revealed to him Enoch
[24:01] came into that condition amen he came
[24:04] into a condition of rapturing Faith but
[24:06] before rapturing Faith Comes Hallelujah
[24:10] Enoch was brought into a position where
[24:12] he could have dominion again Enoch could
[24:15] speak amen hallelujah Enoch you know
[24:17] Jesus could say speak to the mountain
[24:20] because the servant from Adam was
[24:21] standing there he could speak to the
[24:23] stone you go here you go there you go
[24:26] there you go there thank you
[24:30] Lord hallelujah and that's
[24:33] why in this day the seventh from the
[24:37] first second Adam Hallelujah must come

[24:53] going to be taken away from that world
[24:56] hallelujah amen and we know that this
[24:59] world we cannot be conformed to this
[25:02] world this world system which is Satan
[25:05] Eden where sin is
[25:08] glorified sin is glorified and it's so
[25:12] blatant now because 200 million demons
[25:15] are living Loosely on the earth because
[25:18] why if man don't give himself to the
[25:19] Holy Ghost what happens they're giving
[25:21] themselves to demon power yes amen and
[25:23] you might think hey I'm inan the message
[25:25] of the hour no if you never submit
[25:27] yourself to the yielding of the Holy

[25:31] bodies as a Living Sacrifice to him amen
[25:35] and made it only acceptable unto him if
[25:37] your body is not the atmosphere for God

[25:41] then what type of spirit is going to
[25:43] come in there yes I'm trying to contact
[25:46] that Spirit today amen because why every
[25:49] spirit that is contrary to God must be
[25:51] departed from the sou amen amen we want
[25:54] children of God here that are offering
[25:56] their bodies holy and acceptable unto
[25:58] God Amen that is our reasonable service
[26:01] because why we are the Temple of the
[26:03] Living
[26:04] God you must have the Revelation is our
[26:07] that God must dwell in you his Spirit
[26:11] his life must dwell in
[26:13] you so he says and be not conformed to
[26:16] this
[26:17] world but be transformed by the renewing
[26:21] of your mind amen that you may prove
[26:25] what is that good and acceptable and
[26:27] perfect will of
[26:30] God Romans 8:11 says but if the spirit
[26:33] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[26:37] dead dwell in you now you that Spirit
[26:41] can't dwell in you unless you offer your
[26:43] body a Living Sacrifice many people
[26:45] quote that scripture but they're not
[26:47] willing to allow their bodies to be the
[26:50] temple of
[26:52] God hallelujah you can't be with God and
[26:55] be mixing with Egypt amen
[26:59] you can't be with God and be with the
[27:02] things of the
[27:03] world but in the spirit of him that
[27:06] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[27:09] you he that raised up Christ from the
[27:11] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[27:14] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[27:19] you amen
[27:22] amen so people we all want to say we
[27:26] want to speak we speak to this we speak

[28:10] amen that you a son and daughter of God
[28:14] Amen you know I was giving a talk to the
[28:16] family the other day I was telling them
[28:18] you know we're living in a
[28:21] time where believers who call themselves
[28:25] Believers don't know the Bible they
[28:28] don't understand the things of God
[28:31] because they they got so used all these
[28:33] years we satisfied with our conscience
[28:35] that we just believe a message and we
[28:37] come under the safety of that under the
[28:39] security of that that is why when you go
[28:42] into the world and now when you are
[28:45] faced with the Enemy or you are faced in
[28:47] a situation where you have to spread
[28:49] this
[28:51] gospel you get twisted around because we
[28:56] know we mock at denominations we mock at
[28:58] the people of the world we mock at woman
[29:00] preachers you know there's a lot of
[29:02] woman in the world that know the
[29:04] Bible yeah now you're going to preach to
[29:06] them preaching them telling that they
[29:08] shouldn't preach but are you going to
[29:09] take them to the scriptures and show
[29:10] them that how you going to take them to
[29:12] the beginning that he was so how you
[29:14] going to take them to all these things
[29:16] showing them serpent seat and so forth
[29:18] if you don't know this word that's right
[29:20] amen amen coming to church we coming
[29:24] okay the most you come is two times some

[29:49] word the Bible says unto much is given
[29:51] much is required amen yes Lord much is
[29:56] given unto us Lord you see it comes back
[29:59] to knowing what's the
[30:00] purpose you see that we don't understand
[30:02] the purpose of why this Prophet came we
[30:05] thinking the prophet just come to give
[30:06] us a message and as long as we believe
[30:08] him and that he was a prophet and God
[30:11] sent the prophet and we believe there
[30:12] was a pillar of fire there was a cloud
[30:14] that came we believe that that's good
[30:18] enough but what is it doing to you
[30:20] that's right amen help us Lord
[30:23] yes there's a difference I said the last
[30:26] time there the difference with saying
[30:29] I know the message and having the
[30:31] message in you it must be the the living
[30:34] of the the written of pistols must be in
[30:38] you amen Lord and must be manifested
[30:41] through you Lord the pistol that you the
[30:44] word that you are eating must be
[30:46] manifested through you amen yes Lord
[30:48] amen you that's the way you become the
[30:51] god man amen that's the way you have the
[30:54] confidence when the word is in you yes
[30:56] and now when you are in a situ you are
[30:58] able to produce the word yes amen no
[31:01] matter what challenge you are fac you
[31:02] are able to face the challenges you are
[31:05] able to produce the word amen and say
[31:08] Satan it is written yes amen but if you
[31:11] don't know all you going to say
[31:13] Satan amen help us Lord yes you
[31:18] know when a Jewish child is born they T
[31:21] the child from
[31:23] small he must know the scriptures yes
[31:26] the Muslims do the same yes they know
[31:28] the they know the Quran and so forth we
[31:32] are living a we are influenced too much
[31:33] by the
[31:34] West we are influenced too much by the
[31:37] West right and the wst is always
[31:40] influenced only by your media and so
[31:45] forth with now you people are being
[31:47] influenced by TiK ToK by all Instagram
[31:50] by all these things all social media and
[31:52] so forth those are the things that are
[31:53] influencing them yes
[31:59] and it's gone so perverted now that
[32:03] people are will believe any
[32:06] lie people won't even go check out
[32:08] something if it's true as the first
[32:11] things that comes out social people will
[32:13] just believe it people have become so
[32:16] Gable now that's a man who doesn't know
[32:19] his position that's a man that don't
[32:21] know purpose because a man that know his
[32:24] purpose will know why he's waking up in
[32:26] the morning amen
[32:28] will know why he's breeding the next day
[32:32] amen amen will know why he has the bread
[32:34] of life because he knows his purpose
[32:38] amen William Bram came with a message
[32:42] that will catch the rainbow
[32:44] trouts hallelujah amen he went out with
[32:47] the first two pools just for an
[32:49] attraction but the main attraction the
[32:52] main bait was for the rainbow trouts
[32:54] amen many other things came along the
[32:57] way but but he was searching for that
[32:59] rainbow trouts amen he was searching for
[33:02] the wife of Jesus Christ
[33:06] Hallelujah he was searching for the one
[33:08] that will say be unto me according to
[33:11] thy words amen he was searching for the
[33:13] one that will have a home that will
[33:15] reproduce Jesus Christ again
[33:19] amen amen so when you understand that
[33:22] then you understand that you are part of
[33:24] God's economy yes and when you
[33:26] understand of God's economy you began to
[33:29] understand his kingdom and you'll
[33:30] understand now that now what David that
[33:34] Everlasting Kingdom we are about to go
[33:37] and set God is ready to set up his
[33:39] kingdom that's why you find the kingdom
[33:41] of this earth right now crumbling each
[33:44] one is falling apart amen because God is
[33:47] ready to usher in his kingdom yes amen
[33:51] and he's going to come there son of
[33:55] David's amen and we have been reigning
[33:58] with him
[34:00] amen
[34:03] amen so we find this Enoch Enoch knew
[34:08] his
[34:09] purpose Enoch could ever walk with God
[34:12] because he understood his purpose he
[34:14] understood what God called him for he he
[34:17] understood by Revelation by faith amen
[34:20] by by faith Enoch work with God what is
[34:22] Fai the Revelation amen and how we can
[34:25] have this faith is by the revelation of
[34:26] the word yes the word is revela us all
[34:29] the
[34:31] timeall amen because many can read the
[34:34] scriptures but until God anoints you
[34:37] amen so that is why you got to
[34:40] recognize Saul had to be done away with
[34:44] the kingdom because Saul now because one
[34:46] of the things as well because apart from
[34:50] being disobedient to God's word in the
[34:51] exact when the prophet told Saul you do
[34:54] this Saul refused to do that apart from
[34:56] that he also went to familiar spirits to
[35:01] the witch of
[35:02] Endor amen you wouldn't go to tamim if
[35:05] there's no Prophet you go to the Yum
[35:07] tamim yes Heen you go to the word of
[35:13] God if I put that in modern times now
[35:16] you are seeking counsel from the people
[35:18] of the world yeah your pastor is not
[35:20] important to you you don't recognize
[35:23] your pastor God working through
[35:26] him the five Ministry is that important
[35:28] to
[35:29] you the word that you got is that
[35:31] important to you you rather go to your
[35:33] friends for
[35:35] counsel go to your unbelieving families
[35:37] for Counsel on the things that you
[35:42] do people that are not saved yes people
[35:45] who are being influenced by demon power
[35:48] you're going to familiar
[35:51] spirits amen you think God is pleased
[35:53] with that that in the hour when you
[35:56] called you he gave gave you the opening
[35:58] of the word yes everything that you have
[36:01] need of is in this word yes but you want
[36:04] to go find advice somewhere
[36:08] else and you find that advice that's why

[36:16] messed up in your
[36:18] relationships yeah every answer is in

[36:26] for in this hour what pleases
[36:30] God what is what would be sweet smelling
[36:34] Savor to him Amen to his nostrils
[36:38] amen he's come to take us out of this
[36:41] world be not conformed any longer to the
[36:44] pattern of this world Amen if you got a
[36:46] revelation of this word then you'll know
[36:49] that this world is going to be renovated
[36:51] yes yeah you know this world is about to

[36:55] renovated and this Earth you will come
[36:58] back to but not this world Hallelujah it
[37:02] will be another world Amen you will come
[37:04] back to this Earth but not in this world
[37:08] if you understand what I'm saying this
[37:09] world system you will not come into de
[37:12] civilization yes because you from a
[37:14] different
[37:15] civilization you from an eternal
[37:17] civilization this is a temporary
[37:20] civilization that's why everything they
[37:22] give you in this world everything that
[37:24] you're trying to satisfy yourself would
[37:25] is All Temporary
[37:27] from the
[37:29] world but Jesus knows that you have need
[37:31] of house God knows you have need of a
[37:34] car he know you have he knows my
[37:37] children need these things to get by in
[37:39] his life because I put them now in flesh
[37:42] but he said seeky first the kingdom of
[37:46] God and his
[37:49] righteousness then all these temporal
[37:53] things the things that you need to get
[37:54] by in this life amen that shall be had
[37:57] unto
[37:59] you amen he will never see the righteous
[38:02] go Forsaken and neither would he let his
[38:03] children bake
[38:05] bread amen
[38:08] amen so why stress why fear he said
[38:11] don't worry about what food you going to
[38:13] eat what clothes you going to wear he
[38:15] said look at the lies of the field
[38:17] Solomon in all his Splendor was not a
[38:19] like one of them the sparrow there they
[38:22] they toil not but food is provided to
[38:25] them yes
[38:31] but you have to become a prisoner to the
[38:34] world when you understand your purpose
[38:36] you become a prisoner to the
[38:38] word amen amen you become a prisoner to
[38:41] a to a
[38:43] cause because you know it's worth it
[38:46] because this is
[38:48] eternal amen you become a prisoner to
[38:51] God's word and when you become a
[38:53] prisoner to God's word as Paul said I be
[38:55] a prisoner to Jesus Christ yes he called
[38:58] everything else as D amen he was a great
[39:01] Theologian in his day he was a learned
[39:04] person but everything that he knew
[39:06] everything that he attained he called it
[39:09] done and he said now I become a prisoner
[39:12] to Jesus Christ amen in other words he
[39:14] come on a full submission to the word
[39:17] yes because that word living in you it
[39:19] must have the
[39:21] preeminence over everything else over
[39:25] all your Ambitions yes over all the
[39:28] things that you want to acquire in the
[39:30] Natural Life the word must have the
[39:34] preeminence and when the word has the
[39:37] preeminence you will reach good success
[39:40] in every other thing amen you must
[39:43] Daniel had that good success there in
[39:46] Babylon yes yes Joseph had the good
[39:51] success there in Egypt but prisoner
[39:55] first tried and tested first
[39:57] am Hallelujah huj prisoner then went to
[40:01] rule
[40:03] amen and we're going to be Kings and
[40:06] Priests amen you can't come to kingship
[40:08] without being the prisoner
[40:11] first prisoner to the word not prison to
[40:14] the world system now don't don't get
[40:17] yourself in Bound you need to be
[40:18] delivered from that if you in Bound the
[40:20] Bible said what you bind on Earth shall
[40:22] be bound in heaven what you loose on
[40:24] Earth shall be loose on Heaven if the
[40:25] devil is holding you in bondages morning
[40:27] I pray in the name of Jesus that you'll
[40:29] be Loos from that bondage Lord if you
[40:32] feel Lord I'm just born with a situation
[40:35] I have this negative attitude towards
[40:36] life because Lord everything around me
[40:38] was negative my family was negative so I
[40:41] will be negative no I'll say be loose in
[40:43] the name of Jesus Christ am the word of
[40:46] God has come to set you free he has come
[40:48] to preach the good news he's come to set
[40:49] the captives free amen the only thing
[40:52] you should become a prisoner to is full
[40:54] submission to the word yes Lord let the
[40:56] word have the preeminence in your life
[40:58] and the world will produce the rest amen
[41:01] because why the Dynamics of this church
[41:03] is a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen
[41:06] and that's the second anointing to the
[41:07] bride amen you come under the first
[41:09] anointing you come under full submission
[41:11] you come as a prisoner amen you come as
[41:13] a prisoner to the word giving the word
[41:15] the preeminence amen then it must become
[41:18] the time again that's why there was a
[41:20] season and if you got spiritual Insight
[41:22] Insight you'll recognize there was a
[41:24] season there was a season open up amen
[41:27] it was the refilling of the Holy Ghost
[41:29] in the church amen that was the Dynamics
[41:32] amen there was what to come do what to
[41:34] show you to now make you operate
[41:36] according to your purpose make you
[41:38] operate according to why William
[41:40] brandham came
[41:43] amen Sons and Daughters of God coming to
[41:46] adoption in this hour coming to maturity
[41:48] amen there was a time when he came amen
[41:52] and he said now you must be you must
[41:54] stay in the presence of the Sun and be
[41:56] right to be ripened because were green
[41:58] then but you can't be green for 59 years
[42:01] gone now in the preaching 1965 and from
[42:06] then till now it's 59 years you can't be
[42:08] laying in the presence of the Sun and
[42:11] saying I'm still green Hallelujah 59
[42:14] years amen oh it's time amen when the
[42:17] fruit has been ripened amen the fruit is

[42:29] amen that's right amen Lord thank you
[42:32] Lord become fruitful in the things of
[42:34] God yes Lord don't remain stagnant in
[42:36] your walk with him
[42:39] amen amen amen Moses by faith amen he
[42:43] saw by Revelation he saw the how that he
[42:46] was living in amen and he was able to go
[42:49] a one man Invasion and take on
[42:52] Egypt amen by faith Elijah amen when he
[42:57] went to challenge those uh those uh
[42:59] false prophets there what did he do he
[43:02] already slew yes The Oxen Heen and he
[43:06] asked them to pour water before Anything
[43:08] Could Happen Yeah by faith he did that
[43:11] amen because why he already had a
[43:12] revelation amen that he was walking with
[43:14] god oh yes amen and when you have a
[43:17] revelation that the when you know that
[43:19] the word you're giving the word
[43:20] preeminence in your life then you know
[43:22] that you are walking with God Amen is
[43:25] that just walking with him but he must
[43:27] be in you amen the word must be in you
[43:32] amen must have the preeminence
[43:34] hallelujah hallelujah he must have lot
[43:36] you over your life amen hallelujah and
[43:40] when the word has the preeminence and
[43:42] I'm telling you now when you know that
[43:44] God is with you then then if he had to
[43:47] Ser you now walk on the water like how
[43:49] he said to Peter you won't say Lord Oh
[43:52] Lord only if I can touch your hand then
[43:54] I'll walk you say Lord because you said
[43:56] it I'm walking oh Lord I'm walking to
[43:58] the right now even though in Psalms 23
[44:02] David said even though I walked to the
[44:04] valley of shadow of death I will fear no
[44:07] evil because why he knew that God was
[44:09] with
[44:10] him hallelujah oh thank you Lord now it
[44:13] was backed up because the prophet said
[44:15] it amen and he believed it and he knew
[44:17] that he was anointed for the hour he he
[44:20] knew he was the anointed man for the
[44:22] hour so no matter what the challenge is

[44:28] Church it might be insignificant right

[50:44] Ministry okay we'll go to a quote it
[50:50] says in the
[50:53] message it is the rising of the Sun
[50:57] paragraph
[50:59] 92 and to be waved again we realize in
[51:01] the last day according to Luke
[51:03] 17:30 in the s o n day again in the day
[51:08] that the s o n of man will be revealed
[51:11] or waved again over the people now who
[51:14] is the son of man in the beginning was
[51:17] the word and the Word was with Goden and
[51:21] the Word was God and the Word was made
[51:25] flesh
[51:27] and dwelt Among Us and if all the
[51:29] teaching that we have and confirmation
[51:33] of the word of God
[51:38] by by word of God by sence by wonders we
[51:44] see today that in the book of lukia that
[51:48] we just quoted or Luke 17 and 30 and
[51:50] Malachi 4 and the different scriptures
[51:52] that we are acquainted with that the
[51:55] word gave
[51:57] is waved over the people that the Dead
[52:00] traditions of man is dead and the Son of
[52:03] God is alive again with the baptism of
[52:05] the Holy Spirit right Among Us and he's
[52:07] giving us
[52:09] life as Christ was the first one to
[52:11] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[52:14] although typed in many places he was the
[52:16] first fruits of all those that
[52:18] slept in the bright coming of Christ
[52:21] coming out of the church that have
[52:23] there'll have to be a sheep waved again
[52:25] in the last days
[52:27] waving of the sheep what was the Sheep
[52:30] the first one that come to mature the
[52:33] first one that proved it was a
[52:36] wheat that proved it was a sheath
[52:39] Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[52:41] talking about it was waved over the
[52:43] people and the first one they'll come
[52:45] forth for the bright age for a
[52:47] resurrection out of
[52:48] denominationalism will be a message that
[52:52] the full majority of the word has turned
[52:53] back again in its full power and being
[52:56] waved over the People by the same signs
[52:58] and wonders that he did back there yes
[53:00] because I live ye live also speaking to
[53:03] his wife so if the prophet of God come
[53:07] in US hour in the seventh Church age in
[53:10] Son of Man Ministry and was a first wave
[53:13] Chief in this day then we are now at the
[53:18] weat time again because the weed the
[53:20] life is in the wheed right the life is
[53:23] not in the shock anymore yes there was a
[53:25] time when the life was in sh they had
[53:27] the gifts and so forth healing campaigns
[53:29] around the world there's no life there
[53:31] now because the weed is sucking all the
[53:33] life amen so if the life is here there
[53:38] must be another wave shift again many
[53:41] amen that was one example that others
[53:44] will come to maturity again if one come
[53:46] to maturity in this hour then there must
[53:49] be now in the end of the hour amen a

[1:05:00] look alike listen to this quote now both
[1:05:03] claim to be churches both claim to be
[1:05:06] bride but one has mechanics and Dynamics
[1:05:09] it brings it to pass what he said is the
[1:05:13] truth it just won't move no matter how
[1:05:16] good the mechanics is until the Dynamics
[1:05:19] come when the Dynamics come the fire is
[1:05:21] made to connect with that octane in the
[1:05:23] gasoline and when that explode it causes
[1:05:26] a combustion and that combustion moves
[1:05:28] every motion
[1:05:30] every move for e is the same yesterday
[1:05:34] today and forever that's the
[1:05:36] resurrection that's the real power of
[1:05:38] God mechanics with the Dynamics notice
[1:05:41] it's the spirit that quickens it's the
[1:05:43] spirit that fires it's not the gas that
[1:05:46] fires it it's the Sparks that fires the
[1:05:48] gas you can do nothing without me but
[1:05:51] with me you can do all things as he is
[1:05:53] the word it's the Liv it's the father
[1:05:56] living father sent me so send are you as
[1:05:59] the father has fired me and pushed me
[1:06:01] into everything I do only that which is
[1:06:04] pleasing to God now he said me so s are
[1:06:08] you with the same mechanics and he takes
[1:06:10] the same Dynamics to operate it and
[1:06:13] these sh sign shall follow them that
[1:06:15] claim to have the mechanics the Dynamics
[1:06:18] will take its place Paul said to us Paul
[1:06:21] said the gospel came to us not in word
[1:06:24] word only through gasoline only but
[1:06:27] through spark also to make it move there
[1:06:29] you are it came to us in that
[1:06:46] manner so you
[1:06:48] see we''re coming we growing up in the
[1:06:51] hour now amen the spirit of God when
[1:06:55] when you start to have a preeminence in
[1:06:56] you then he'll bring you to his faith
[1:06:58] Amen to his virtue to his knowledge to
[1:07:01] his Temperance through his patience
[1:07:03] through his godliness through his
[1:07:05] brotherly kindness through his love but
[1:07:08] he must be his life must be in you
[1:07:11] because you can't produce your own life
[1:07:13] it is his life in you his life being
[1:07:16] reproduced again he say how can I do it
[1:07:19] he say I can do all things through
[1:07:21] Christ Jesus amen who strengthens me
[1:07:24] amen as Christ God was in Christ now he
[1:07:30] is in the bride amen amen amen praise
[1:07:33] the Lord thank you Lord one more quote
[1:07:35] here what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:07:38] for now the church has come through
[1:07:41] those
[1:07:41] schools she married back Yonder a long
[1:07:44] time ago and became a denomination and
[1:07:46] organization but you notice the birth
[1:07:48] produced something else and now it's got
[1:07:50] to a place to where the Pentecostal
[1:07:53] church with the New Birth has been
[1:07:54] tested and tried and now it's coming to
[1:07:56] a place God doesn't deal with the church
[1:07:59] as just an organization he doesn't deal
[1:08:01] with the church as a group of
[1:08:06] people he deals with the church as an
[1:08:08] individual each individual in the church
[1:08:11] and now it's got to a time and it's no
[1:08:14] secret we'll all see it when a man
[1:08:18] proves that God loves him he takes him
[1:08:20] out somewhere to himself there in the
[1:08:22] front of angels he does something for
[1:08:24] him he lifts up there in the presence of
[1:08:26] God and Gifts him and fills him and sets
[1:08:29] him out that's the age that we're living
[1:08:32] in same holy spirit that saved the
[1:08:34] lutherans that Sanctified the Methodist
[1:08:36] that baptized the Pentecostals is Now
[1:08:38] setting in order the coming of the Lord
[1:08:40] Jesus when it be so powerful that body
[1:08:43] will come into this group a church that
[1:08:46] will draw the rest of them from the
[1:08:48] grave there'll be a resurrection that's
[1:08:52] what the Holy Ghost is for what is the
[1:08:54] Holy Ghost for what is the Holy Ghost
[1:08:56] without us they cannot be made perfect
[1:08:58] they lived in one day and DEP we living
[1:09:01] in another day amen amen so all nature
[1:09:05] all creation is groaning even them
[1:09:07] beyond the grave waiting for sons of God
[1:09:09] to come into their
[1:09:11] position but sons of God are walking now
[1:09:16] in their
[1:09:17] positions but there's much more
[1:09:19] potential to explore amen there's much
[1:09:22] more land to possess yes you got to
[1:09:25] cultivate the land you got to make the
[1:09:27] land fruitful you got to make the land a
[1:09:30] blessed land amen and how and who's
[1:09:32] doing that it's the Holy Ghost through
[1:09:35] the fivefold ministry positionally
[1:09:37] placing the people amen feeding them
[1:09:40] what the potentials are feeding them
[1:09:43] keep reminding them of the identity yes
[1:09:45] because the devil don't want you to to
[1:09:47] remember your identity he want you to
[1:09:49] doubt your identity he wants you doubt
[1:09:52] you know what the first thing he
[1:09:54] does he reminds you of all your failures
[1:09:58] he reminds you of the all the weaknesses
[1:10:00] in the flesh now you now he makes you
[1:10:03] doubt your salvation and whether you
[1:10:05] going to go to
[1:10:07] heaven but when you the messeng has come
[1:10:10] to show you that you are you an eternal
[1:10:13] being amen an eternal being cannot be
[1:10:17] lost so why are you feeling what the
[1:10:19] devil is putting your mind yes if you're
[1:10:22] part of God you're coming from God's
[1:10:23] Eternal thoughts you just manifested in
[1:10:26] a time and season yeah your father and
[1:10:28] mother to meet at a certain time to
[1:10:29] produce a body for you to come and drop
[1:10:31] in there yes you he what I said for you
[1:10:34] to drop in there because the body is
[1:10:37] only housing
[1:10:38] you but we living in a time where
[1:10:41] there's going to be such a
[1:10:44] time everything must go back to the
[1:10:46] original even the body amen is going to
[1:10:49] defy the Earth the come from is going to
[1:10:52] change from Mortal to
[1:10:53] immortality the body is going to have a
[1:10:56] change amen so that's the time we're
[1:10:59] living in amen so that's the purpose of
[1:11:03] why God sent this Prophet amen amen to
[1:11:05] prepare us for this hour to prepare us
[1:11:08] to become a people that God can use in
[1:11:11] this hour to produce Jesus Christ again
[1:11:14] Amen to ambassad to to be ambassadors
[1:11:17] and representative of another kingdom
[1:11:20] because this world that we must not be
[1:11:22] conformed to now is going to be
[1:11:24] destroyed that's why Enoch could have
[1:11:26] that Revelation and Enoch would walk
[1:11:28] with God because he was walking with an
[1:11:31] eternal God because he knew he's going
[1:11:34] to he's not going to die he's not going
[1:11:36] to see death but he's going to go amen
