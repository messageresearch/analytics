[18:35] thing to stand in this position
[18:38] at the same time it's not easy amen all
[18:41] right some people might think it's easy
[18:43] it's never easy to be a pastor yes
[18:46] it's a very very difficult Road and
[18:48] here's a church you must hold his hands
[18:52] okay lift him up to the Lord remember
[18:55] he's a human being just like you amen
[18:58] there's nothing different about
[18:59] ministers all right so we're just like

[19:09] you to support our brother may the Lord
[19:11] which you bless him as he continues all
[19:15] the thought to to pass to the church
[19:18] okay so we find it's actually according
[19:20] to scriptures you know that Generations
[19:23] in the family takes takes on you know
[19:25] the position
[19:28] as creatures of the Gospel
[19:30] so it's everything is in order it's
[19:33] according to the word of the Lord
[19:36] so God with you bless you this morning
[19:39] we want to speak a few things and look
[19:42] accessible what we say this morning that
[19:44] the Lord will help us amen so remember
[19:47] now why you come here you don't come to
[19:50] see one another amen amen okay you come
[19:52] here just one purpose and you come to
[19:56] Worship the Lord amen you come to listen
[19:59] to his word and you come
[20:02] to choose yes okay so we don't want to
[20:06] listen to all the preaching and not
[20:08] change that's the problem amen you could
[20:11] go to change
[20:13] and whatever we listen to we try to live
[20:15] it we'll have our struggles here and
[20:17] there like they say we might lose a
[20:19] battle here and there but we we win the
[20:22] war amen that's the important thing
[20:26] okay so God bless you we thank God for
[20:29] the message amen yes
[20:32] you know the revelation of his word and
[20:36] remember you can thank God because the
[20:39] fact that you can come here to a message
[20:41] church that you know God has chosen you
[20:44] yeah amen hallelujah because remember he
[20:47] bypasses millions of people but he chose
[20:50] you amen thank you and so appreciate him
[20:53] for that yeah so many people don't see
[20:55] what you believe they might not ever see
[20:58] it yes okay but you can thank God
[21:00] because you know the word of God is
[21:02] promised he said I'll give you higher
[21:04] self that you will see amen
[21:07] so we can be very very grateful to God
[21:09] so I was raised up in the uh
[21:12] Methodist Church
[21:15] then we got into the Pentecostal people
[21:16] a little more as you know we
[21:20] we grew more
[21:22] but you see God has a birthplace for
[21:24] everybody amen yes and then we find
[21:28] yeah you know those days gone by because
[21:30] Pastor Dan it was uh late Pastor
[21:33] Christie Roberts and you know like one
[21:35] of them
[21:36] and then we begin to see this message
[21:39] and of course we had uh
[21:42] challenges from our families and so
[21:44] forth but we pressed on Amen so that's
[21:48] important thing we don't buckle down to
[21:49] anything amen No Matter What opposition
[21:52] comes out with yes they can mock you
[21:55] they can do all sorts of things but we
[21:57] know in our heart God has revealed this
[21:59] message
[22:01] we're very very grateful for the Lord
[22:03] for that right
[22:10] he's got some notes
[22:13] one John
[22:15] 2 15 to 17.
[22:31] first John
[22:35] chapter 2
[22:37] and 15 to 17.
[22:43] love not the world neither the things
[22:45] that are in the world if any man love
[22:48] the world the love of the father is not
[22:51] in him
[22:52] I want you to know this is very
[22:54] straightforward right yeah
[22:56] for all that is in the world
[22:59] the lust of the flesh
[23:01] the lust of the eyes
[23:03] and the pride of life is not of the
[23:07] father but of the world
[23:11] now verse 17 and this is important and
[23:14] the world passeth away
[23:18] and the last thereof
[23:20] but either do it the will of God abides
[23:24] forever
[23:26] all right one John 5.
[23:40] and verse 19.
[23:47] and we know
[23:48] that we are of God
[23:51] and the whole world lies in which
[23:55] the spirit
[23:58] father we indeed grateful to you this
[24:00] morning Lord It's a privilege to be in
[24:02] the presence of the Lord amen to be here
[24:05] with your dear people yes
[24:07] we're grateful oh God for the singing
[24:09] we're grateful for the worship and and
[24:12] Lord once again we pray we realize it's
[24:15] uh it's now the time that you must speak
[24:17] to us amen yes Lord so I am the Lord
[24:20] submit ourselves to you we pray that you
[24:23] will give us spiritual understanding
[24:25] divine revelation yes we pray the spirit
[24:29] of God will come and make things clear
[24:30] in our hearts and our lives father we
[24:33] will open Lord to you this morning amen
[24:35] whatever you want to tell us it is
[24:39] we pray that the spirit of God will help
[24:42] us once again bless all your pastor
[24:44] Adrian oh God together with his family
[24:46] amen and sister Grace oh God together
[24:48] with the rest of the family and even
[24:50] Sean's wife Lord the family we come with
[24:53] all of them to you now and the rest of
[24:55] your children we pray in Jesus name amen
[24:58] God bless you
[25:04] looking at yeah we
[25:06] we're looking
[25:11] John
[25:14] this great Apostle yes
[25:18] okay so I think we're quite familiar
[25:19] with this
[25:21] gospels when we look at we look at
[25:23] Matthew Mark Luke and John
[25:27] okay if you show the old Believers you
[25:30] know the message so brother Brian taught
[25:33] us and he showed us you know
[25:34] the lion the ox the man and the eagle
[25:37] amen yes
[25:38] okay under those four uh the schools
[25:43] that was written
[25:45] and it depicts that right and we know
[25:48] it's showing the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:51] but the thing that we want to look at
[25:54] this morning in particular remember John
[25:58] typifies the eagle amen hallelujah all
[26:02] right so this morning we're going to
[26:04] look to look at things
[26:07] by the ego perspective yes
[26:11] all right the ego perspective remember
[26:14] Lord told to John he says come up higher
[26:17] yes
[26:19] okay so we find now we are moving in the
[26:24] cycle of Revelation yes divine
[26:27] revelation
[26:28] okay
[26:30] and you'll find we're able to see things
[26:32] that we didn't see before yes amen the
[26:36] reason being that remember the promise
[26:39] was that he would give us I sell that we
[26:41] might see
[26:43] we can see those wonderful things while
[26:46] it's hidden to other people
[26:47] [Music]
[26:49] so that makes you special as the Bride
[26:51] of Jesus Christ amen that is why brother
[26:55] Brian told us you know this message
[26:57] now look the the fivefold ministry is
[27:00] very very important yes amen
[27:03] okay you know we can play the tits so we
[27:05] have to play the tapes that is good
[27:07] enough but that is not sufficient yeah
[27:10] I'll tell you why brother made a
[27:12] statement you said the faithful ministry
[27:15] will make more sense to what I'm saying
[27:18] amen
[27:21] is
[27:24] so brother probably the word in the seed
[27:27] form amen amen hallelujah okay we we're
[27:30] blessed with the convention yeah the
[27:32] Easter conventional you saw the word has
[27:34] been unfolded
[27:36] all right the word is placed there but
[27:38] it takes the faithful Ministry to take
[27:41] these things and to break it down and to
[27:44] bring it to the people and we have all
[27:46] the Ministries
[27:47] call some prophets pastors teachers
[27:50] evangelism faithfulness right
[27:55] so let's look at some of these things
[28:03] so what is the difference
[28:07] so when you look at the other gospels
[28:09] let's look at Matthew Mark and Luke
[28:12] will notice
[28:14] the Bible is written in Parables yeah
[28:19] all right you know the different
[28:20] Parables we're going to go through it
[28:22] many parables
[28:24] one thing that is very very outstanding
[28:26] in the Book of John
[28:28] there's no problem
[28:30] yeah
[28:31] John doesn't write parables
[28:34] amen hallelujah why John sees things
[28:37] from an eagle perspective amen
[28:41] okay John tells you the real story as it
[28:45] is amen amen there is no types and
[28:47] shadows in the Book of John
[28:53] that's wonderful because
[28:55] God is doing something amen God is
[28:59] showing you that you must go higher yeah
[29:04] right so what does John do John breaks
[29:08] into the mysteries of God amen amen
[29:12] which means that this book which always
[29:15] talk about Revelation but now I'm
[29:17] talking about John yes and John also
[29:19] wrote Revelation amen
[29:22] all right so when John writes this book
[29:24] we find this this book was not even open
[29:28] to the public
[29:34] it's not opened up
[29:36] another box so when you go look at
[29:38] similarities now
[29:40] watch the hidden things right
[29:43] so you will notice in the Book of John
[29:46] if you really look at it we've got no
[29:47] time to go through all that the
[29:49] scriptures as such
[29:50] we will find the Declaration I am up
[29:54] here seven times
[29:55] [Music]
[29:57] there's a seven I am declaration amen
[30:00] all right
[30:02] so you go look at it and you'll find to
[30:05] break it down Jesus said I am the bread
[30:07] of life
[30:09] I am I am the light of the world
[30:12] I am the door to the Sheep
[30:16] okay I am the Good Shepherd amen I am
[30:20] the resurrection and the life
[30:24] I am the way the truth and the life amen
[30:30] seven Declarations of I am
[30:35] and then we find out go the Book of
[30:37] Revelation 7 7 7. seven land stands
[30:42] seven churches seven schools before
[30:45] control yes seven Thunders Seven Seals
[30:49] amen seven seven seven seven it's the
[30:52] same writer amen amen
[30:56] okay
[30:57] then we find out that each gospel writer
[31:00] complemented the other yeah
[31:04] okay Matthew Mark Luke and John as I
[31:07] said Each one showing the lion then we
[31:10] have the ox the man and the eagle you
[31:12] know through that we see the church ages
[31:14] all these things under that anointing
[31:17] amen
[31:18] okay so if there was an ox anointing so
[31:22] the people could give their lives over
[31:24] yes okay so there's an eagle anointing
[31:28] in our time amen
[31:32] right so that's very very important
[31:33] right
[31:35] right now
[31:37] to the Book of Matthew
[31:39] uh Matthew starts the genealogy as
[31:43] presents Christ the King
[31:47] okay so you'll find Matthew's genealogy
[31:50] is presenting the Christ the Christ the
[31:52] King we know is the king
[31:54] yes
[31:55] the lion he is the line of the tribe of
[31:58] Judah amen amen all right so watch these
[32:01] things you're not breaking it further as
[32:03] I said it will take too much of time as
[32:05] you know
[32:06] Here Comes This genealogy and he
[32:09] presents Christ the King what does he
[32:10] say he says Jesus Christ the son of
[32:14] David why
[32:16] amen watch the kingly like and the
[32:19] kingly expression
[32:22] all right because David was the first
[32:24] king and then what does he do he leaves
[32:27] out all the others and he comes to
[32:29] Abraham amen
[32:32] all right he comes to Abraham
[32:35] the leaves of the others why because
[32:38] Abraham met King melchized amen
[32:43] right
[32:45] then we find out that Mark is the uh the
[32:49] ox
[32:50] which
[32:51] presents Christ
[32:53] as a servant yes that's what Mark does
[32:57] right
[32:59] he's visiting Christ as a servant now if
[33:02] you watch something
[33:03] when you employ a servant
[33:06] right you don't worry about his
[33:08] genealogy really yeah
[33:12] all right
[33:13] and then of course you don't employ
[33:16] infants
[33:18] all right
[33:20] so what Mark does when Mark starts the
[33:24] gospel he starts with Christ at 50. 30
[33:29] years of age yeah
[33:31] nothing about infancy
[33:33] all right
[33:35] and then you will you will find and he
[33:37] tells us how Christ was baptized by John
[33:40] and so forth so Mark doesn't present a
[33:45] genealism
[33:47] right
[33:48] Luke is the man and the Man Comes the
[33:52] third anointing
[33:54] now watch this right Luke starts the
[33:57] genealogy backwards
[34:02] Luke's has a genealogy backwards right
[34:05] and he starts with Jesus Christ and he
[34:09] goes all the way back to Adam the man
[34:13] [Music]
[34:16] what does he do he's giving the man's
[34:18] view of Christ
[34:21] so that's why Luke's gospel is so full
[34:25] with Parables giving the man's heal yeah
[34:32] yeah okay but now
[34:35] we find okay we know Prophets
[34:39] uh
[34:41] prophets are eagles amen
[34:45] you know right yes it was
[34:48] Ezekiel Ezekiel Saw our modern highways
[34:54] and you saw the lights of vehicles
[34:57] flashing yes
[34:59] all right he was caught up in this time
[35:03] but he was a prophet way back
[35:06] thousands of years because God's word is
[35:10] always true and unfailing hallelujah
[35:12] amen all right so you saw all these
[35:15] things why he said Eagle amen amen
[35:20] God that glimp so God showed him
[35:25] and so if I
[35:27] John shows now the eagle John shows no
[35:31] earthly genealogy
[35:34] right
[35:35] he shows nothing on the Earthly line
[35:39] isn't this wonderful amen he shows
[35:41] nothing on the airplane what does he do
[35:43] he he starts off in the beginning was
[35:47] the word amen hallelujah
[35:51] is going to Eternity yes he's the eagle
[35:55] in the beginning was the word we find
[35:58] that this is a prophetic View
[36:02] this is the Eagle's View of Jesus Christ
[36:07] all right we've seen him in all other
[36:09] forms throughout the ages where John
[36:12] comes back here and tells us how it
[36:15] began yes amen
[36:18] and he takes Jesus right to the logos
[36:23] all right when God gave birth to himself
[36:28] yes
[36:29] that's what the prophet taught us God
[36:33] giving birth to himself
[36:36] right
[36:39] so yeah
[36:40] and then we find it shows us how
[36:43] creation began
[36:46] see John is dealing with mysterious
[36:49] things
[36:51] so Jonah is able to bring these things
[36:53] to the bride the bride can catch the
[36:56] true Revelation all right and know who
[36:59] God is know who you are know where you
[37:02] come from know what you're doing here
[37:04] all right I know where you're going to
[37:07] those are the wonderful things that you
[37:08] know Israel known when we find creation
[37:11] began
[37:15] it's only go back we find through the
[37:17] beginning of the creation of God
[37:19] the promise of God is very clear in
[37:22] John's gospel without the use of
[37:25] parables
[37:27] so John doesn't use Parables but it
[37:30] shows us the promise of God is the
[37:32] promises are very very clear right
[37:37] here you find now the gospel is entirely
[37:40] to the believer always say to the bride
[37:44] in our terms yes right the gospels now
[37:47] to them
[37:49] right
[37:50] you know we add uh Parables you know uh
[37:54] 10 virgins all that uh you know the
[37:58] household The Vineyards all these kind
[38:01] of a thing each one of us to revealing
[38:05] Christ
[38:07] all right but you say John doesn't speak
[38:09] like that
[38:11] but what did John tell us
[38:13] you find this year in John 14.
[38:17] all right what is writing Jesus said so
[38:21] watch Journal is coming very straight to
[38:23] the point no Shadows no Parables but
[38:26] what he says in John 14 in My Father's
[38:30] House
[38:34] now he's coming Street and direct to the
[38:37] truth yeah because he has an eagle's
[38:40] perspective
[38:41] in my father's house are many mansions
[38:46] right
[38:48] not spoken of in the other Gospels
[38:51] right
[38:52] he was giving the prophetic View and
[38:55] showing the positioning of a Believer
[38:58] yes
[39:01] okay
[39:03] you find out in John 15
[39:05] Jesus said to the disciples I no more
[39:09] call you servants I no more call you
[39:13] servants but I call you friends amen
[39:16] hallelujah okay but in John 13 we find
[39:21] Jesus in an indirect way called
[39:25] themselves
[39:27] all right and the Lord's supper and food
[39:30] washing Jesus said you call me master
[39:33] and Lord
[39:35] for so I am
[39:37] right
[39:38] Jesus said use you speak right right
[39:43] you'll notice that
[39:45] Judas was there
[39:48] after chapter 13 Jesus Judas goes out of
[39:53] the scene all right and you'll find his
[39:57] only seed at the Betrayal
[40:00] okay
[40:02] see how beautifully the scriptures are
[40:05] put together okay Jesus was uh
[40:10] revealing
[40:12] his intimacy yes amen false church is
[40:16] not there yes he's revealing it to the
[40:19] bride okay so you you find here right uh
[40:25] so Jesus was the living is in intimacy
[40:28] to his disciples
[40:33] John 17 is a prayer of Jesus for his
[40:37] disciples for us you don't find that in
[40:40] the other gospels all right so
[40:43] what he's saying is you know watch that
[40:46] intimacy by the writer John and
[40:50] revealing to you and I these things by
[40:53] uh by the perspective of an eagle all
[40:57] right he's watching all these things
[41:00] okay
[41:05] okay right so yeah this is to be one of
[41:07] two things yeah
[41:09] so Jesus prayed for us
[41:12] how can that prayer become void
[41:16] Jesus is praying for his bride
[41:20] can that prayer become void so we've got
[41:23] to really believe it believe that Jesus
[41:26] prayed for you
[41:28] all right and here we find so Jesus
[41:32] prayed a personal prayer for us in John
[41:35] 17 then he he spoke of the mystery of
[41:40] him and the bride
[41:42] you'll notice this Misty uh intertwined
[41:45] in the Book of John about the bride I in
[41:49] me and
[41:50] you and me and we are We Are One all
[41:53] that kind of things is the Mysteries
[41:55] that Jesus was speaking were all written
[41:57] in the Book of John
[41:59] okay
[42:01] why you said uh they are in me that they
[42:05] might be made perfect in one it's a
[42:07] mystery
[42:08] right so all these things was declaring
[42:11] okay you'll find in the Gospel of John
[42:14] the other gospels out of Christ's birth
[42:17] and at 33 years John's gospel went
[42:21] beyond that amen yes all right John
[42:24] showed the beginning of the creation of
[42:26] God in the beginning was the word John
[42:29] broke into the Realms of Eternity amen
[42:32] declaring the logos and the future
[42:36] all right
[42:37] so again we're saying John did not use
[42:41] parables
[42:42] in uh in Jesus's coming like he was in
[42:46] the days of no other gospel said that
[42:48] like it was in the days of Noah so shall
[42:51] it be of lot and all that
[42:54] John straight away come and said look he
[42:57] says the finishing point is all the
[42:59] supremas were to the father's house in
[43:01] My Father's House on many mentions he
[43:04] leaves all the other things right then
[43:07] he says I will come again and receive
[43:10] you
[43:12] the intimacy again to his bride I will
[43:15] come and receive you unto myself all
[43:19] right it was plain John gave us a
[43:22] prophetic view very plain so John did
[43:26] not go to times and shadows now he's
[43:28] speaking directly to the believer both
[43:31] the Book of John and the Book of
[43:33] Revelation
[43:34] is the full revelation of Jesus Christ
[43:39] amen okay
[43:46] so we find out
[43:48] so we said in John 10 he says I am the
[43:51] door
[43:55] and in Revelation 4 4 4 you
[43:59] is
[44:00] the aura saw a door opened in heaven
[44:02] amen
[44:04] okay
[44:07] so what does brother bring Jesus about
[44:08] this doll it's a Dolph Revolution yeah
[44:12] right and he comes and says right to
[44:14] ever now Jesus on Earth he said I'm the
[44:17] dog
[44:18] Zone comes up he sees these things he
[44:20] says I see a door opened what's the evil
[44:25] all right
[44:26] that's open in heaven
[44:28] John was in a Heavenly dimension
[44:31] not only for the Book of Revelation
[44:35] but to write the Gospel
[44:38] as we read we are transported into the
[44:41] Heavenly Dimensions ourselves
[44:45] remember you know Jesus is the right
[44:49] dude we are the Beloved bride where
[44:52] Jesus is that's where we will be amen we
[44:55] cannot be separated from here amen all
[44:58] right we won okay Prophet showed us in
[45:00] many many uh uh cases all right but so
[45:04] we move into that heavenly Dimension
[45:07] ourselves all right and then we see we
[45:11] look into these things and see the glory
[45:14] of God we see how God opened up these
[45:18] things
[45:19] now we don't see through a glass Darkly
[45:21] we are seeing face to face right so now
[45:25] remember now well as I said you know the
[45:28] church we're moving in Revelation
[45:32] okay that's actually going to come a
[45:34] time when it's going to reach that
[45:36] Climax and you'll find there will be
[45:37] that bodily change so The Church Must
[45:40] position itself to receive from this
[45:42] revolution
[45:46] okay
[45:47] so now let's get through a few things
[45:50] right
[45:53] so we're coming back to one uh John
[45:57] chapter 5 and we read verse 19.
[46:03] okay so there you told us
[46:08] okay he says
[46:11] we know that whosoever is born of God
[46:14] sin it not but he that is
[46:18] begotten of God
[46:21] hebrewed himself and that Wicked one
[46:24] toucheth him not
[46:27] all right now you know something we must
[46:30] not give place to the devil
[46:33] all right in whatever we do remember
[46:37] you are overcome amen all right and
[46:41] you'll always you you know we always got
[46:44] Victory amen okay look we have our
[46:48] struggles we will not immune to certain
[46:49] things and
[46:50] this life we have our sicknesses and
[46:53] problems whatever
[46:54] okay but that don't change God one bit
[46:57] of who it is
[47:03] so so now let's watch this
[47:07] so we find out you know you'll notice
[47:09] according to John's writings
[47:12] there's only two groups of people he
[47:15] identifies in this world
[47:17] two groups of people
[47:20] all right two groups of people that
[47:23] exist in this world
[47:25] only two types of people according to
[47:28] John and his children of God and
[47:31] Children Of Satan amen because he would
[47:34] never be down
[47:36] all right leave all this Earthly uh
[47:40] religions
[47:42] and this one world things and one God
[47:45] region all these kind of things is not
[47:47] according to the world
[47:48] right so John is saying look there's two
[47:51] classes of people you're either you're a
[47:54] Believer or you're an unbeliever
[47:57] all right children of God and children
[47:59] of Satan
[48:02] so one belongs either to God or to the
[48:05] evil world
[48:08] are you coming to something
[48:10] the evil World system that is Satan's
[48:15] domain
[48:16] all right don't forget we are in Satan's
[48:20] Eden
[48:21] okay in Satan's Eden
[48:26] and so you know you know why is John
[48:29] placing so much emphasis this is not
[48:31] Elemental stuff
[48:33] why is the ego okay the Eagle's View
[48:37] placing so much of emphasis on the world
[48:42] system all right and God or the devil's
[48:47] children and God's children why is he
[48:50] placing an emphasis and telling us look
[48:52] this world he says it will pass away and
[48:56] the lust thereof amen
[48:58] okay remember now if if you are walking
[49:02] with God you qualify for
[49:05] eternity for heaven okay and so we find
[49:09] so John is saying look there's only two
[49:12] of them now
[49:13] and you're fine because the old world
[49:17] the whole world belongs to Satan
[49:19] Christians should avoid its
[49:22] contamination amen yes
[49:27] I don't get contaminated with the world
[49:30] now sometimes don't think you'll say you
[49:33] know what I'm strong and I can just
[49:34] overcome you'll be surprised the devil
[49:36] will take you with a back end you
[49:38] wouldn't know what happened
[49:40] never never underestimate the devil
[49:43] you're not we're not giving him glory
[49:45] but he's your number one enemy you do
[49:48] everything to bring you down
[49:50] or as you've got to avoid its
[49:52] contamination
[49:56] second Corinthians 4 4 the God of this
[50:01] world has blinded the minds of them
[50:05] which believe not
[50:07] so it's quite busy
[50:10] so if you want to turn back and resist
[50:12] God if you want to resist the ministry
[50:15] if you want to resist what the Holy
[50:17] Ghost is telling you the devil will
[50:19] further blind you amen so you don't
[50:22] receive truth and he's doing it yes yeah
[50:25] that's right
[50:27] okay and definitely we can't be
[50:29] comfortable with that something is wrong
[50:30] if we are comfortable with that
[50:35] so is blinded Satan blinds men to God's
[50:39] truth through the world system he has
[50:42] created
[50:46] will system that Satan has created
[50:50] without a Godly influence man left to
[50:54] himself will follow that system
[50:59] right so the Godly influence is so very
[51:02] important
[51:04] so don't you know you've got to raise
[51:06] your children according to the laws of
[51:09] God Amen
[51:10] and if your child is doing something
[51:12] wrong don't say they they say these days
[51:14] he's comfortable with that that is
[51:16] nonsense you've got to stand with the
[51:19] word of God
[51:20] okay you can be comfortable with nothing
[51:22] outside the word of the Lord okay and
[51:25] you find it will be that same fellow
[51:28] that lovely beautiful child will turn
[51:31] out to be a renegade in the end
[51:33] right why because he was schooled under
[51:37] that so-called evil system
[51:40] okay and we let our children go like
[51:43] that and you'll find they'll be gone
[51:46] already you know they're waiting for the
[51:48] schools and every places Society
[51:52] okay they want to bring them down or
[51:54] make them part of them
[51:58] okay now every watch
[52:00] James the brother of John
[52:09] adulthoods and adulteresses
[52:12] okay now sometimes we say we think of
[52:14] the natural
[52:15] act but it's a metaphorical description
[52:18] of spiritual unfaithfulness
[52:22] all right so spiritual and faithfulness
[52:25] as much as the natural Act is also wrong
[52:27] we find that James as in view professing
[52:31] Christians outwardly associated with the
[52:36] church
[52:38] but holding a deep affection for the
[52:41] evil World System
[52:44] so how many today
[52:46] the same message and message and
[52:48] messenger but have you got that
[52:50] affection for the world you've got that
[52:53] desire in you for the world
[52:56] you're dressed a certain way when you
[52:58] come to church and when you go to work
[53:00] you just a certain way
[53:02] you put your dress in the church when
[53:04] you go to work you put your pants on
[53:06] these things are true I'm not saying
[53:09] you're doing it
[53:15] we're fooling ourselves
[53:19] right doing these things and holding a
[53:22] deep affection for the world you know
[53:24] something that is what I'm saying is so
[53:26] serious we've got an eagle's perspective
[53:28] John it's time to tell us look if you do
[53:30] these things he won't even enter into
[53:32] the glory land
[53:33] we should join us very very straight
[53:35] that is why you also find James a very
[53:38] straight writer we're not seeing the
[53:40] others are not straight but replacing
[53:42] their emphasis for a special reason amen
[53:45] amen okay so we don't be just you know
[53:48] saving Christian friendship with the
[53:50] world
[53:52] all right
[53:53] it's too often as thus you know why you
[53:56] know let's face it or we we're ashamed
[53:58] you know like they will laugh at us the
[54:01] way we dress like the ground says you
[54:03] say you're putting a flat tire and then
[54:06] all those things about your air and so
[54:07] forth because there was something you're
[54:10] gonna please them they'll go to hell you
[54:12] need to please them yes
[54:15] men
[54:16] friendship of the world
[54:19] all right we're saying we're looking at
[54:21] the ego's perspective well I said again
[54:22] this is not Elementary
[54:25] otherwise John wouldn't be writing this
[54:27] as the eagle
[54:28] right so the the Greek word describes
[54:32] love in the sense of a strong emotional
[54:36] attachment
[54:39] right those who did
[54:41] and intimate longing for the things of
[54:44] the world give evidence that they are
[54:48] not redeemed hmm
[54:51] right it's strong but it's true why it's
[54:55] energy with God
[54:57] The Sovereign thought that unbelievers
[54:59] are God's enemies is taught throughout
[55:02] this country
[55:04] and we're going to go back to see what
[55:06] the scriptures are teaching us
[55:08] all right
[55:09] okay
[55:12] and that is why Romans 8 7 tells us the
[55:15] carnal mind is enmity against God that
[55:19] is why it calls for a discipline of our
[55:22] minds how we think what we speak all
[55:25] these things are very very important
[55:27] because a carnal mind is enmity against
[55:30] God you want to be an enemy with God
[55:34] I mean who's going to win with you an
[55:36] enemy with God
[55:37] okay your battle is done finished
[55:41] so
[55:42] John is saying again the whole world
[55:45] lieth in wickedness
[55:48] the evil World System under Satan's
[55:51] control
[55:52] message like Satan's Eden all these
[55:56] things to tell us these things
[55:58] okay so the world and we're looking at
[56:01] the world and yeah we read 1 John 2 15
[56:04] 17 we find this is not a reference to
[56:07] the physical
[56:08] material world
[56:11] but the invisible spiritual system of
[56:15] evil dominated by Satan
[56:18] so you think you're looking at physical
[56:20] world normal
[56:22] okay we find you saying it's an
[56:24] invisible spiritual system you say is
[56:27] Satan fighting you you can't see him
[56:30] it's invisible
[56:31] but the war is going on yes
[56:34] yes you see many times lots of us we
[56:36] even forget we you know battle
[56:44] right
[56:46] so
[56:48] so what is telling us
[56:50] again very straightforward very cutting
[56:53] John was leaving nothing behind all that
[56:56] is in the world the lust
[57:00] all right what is last a strong desire
[57:05] for evil things
[57:08] you really speaking if we are under that
[57:11] situation and we are under bondage
[57:13] all right and that must be broken amen
[57:17] all right so you think what the church
[57:19] needs no not more lectures I'm not even
[57:22] more preaching but we need the person of
[57:25] the obligation Amen to come into our
[57:27] that changes us yes like somebody said
[57:30] you know we always want to look on the
[57:31] outside you know we tell our children
[57:33] don't do this don't do this don't do
[57:35] that don't do this and they wonder what
[57:36] you're talking a lot but let them
[57:38] receive the whole egos then the outside
[57:40] will be taken care of Amen
[57:43] all right
[57:46] all that's in the world is loss of the
[57:49] flesh
[57:50] right refers to the sin nature of man
[57:56] okay again who's the trouble causer
[58:00] Satan uses the evil system will system
[58:03] to incite the flesh
[58:06] okay then we have the lust of the eyes
[58:09] and we find that Satan uses this Avenue
[58:12] to incite wrong desires
[58:17] okay and all these things and then we'll
[58:20] say we have the parade of life
[58:24] pride of life
[58:26] you know they say like the peacocks you
[58:29] know
[58:29] so proud but he's living in a fallen
[58:34] world yeah that's where we are and then
[58:37] we find pride of life arrogance over one
[58:40] circumstances
[58:48] the slaves of so-called Christians today
[58:50] yeah
[58:52] okay verse 17 has told us but the good
[58:56] news for us John is telling us the world
[58:58] is passing
[59:01] so everything that we think we've got
[59:03] permanence here is passing away yes amen
[59:07] okay
[59:08] you know one time uh you know Prophet
[59:11] was speaking to somebody
[59:13] and you know he had that 1940 something
[59:16] uh the Ford you know is Mojo Khan
[59:19] he says you know
[59:21] I done everything to take care of that
[59:23] car and he will polish it and every
[59:26] other thing will look so good and you
[59:29] turn back around I don't know whatever
[59:30] year it was maybe around the 60s and he
[59:33] says you know something
[59:35] desire to go and look for my thought I
[59:39] would not find one piece
[59:45] who's happened
[59:46] that's why it's time to tell us look
[59:48] whatever we do if there's no endurance
[59:51] we are wasting our time
[59:54] because I can't find a piece of it but I
[59:56] worked for it
[59:57] I spent my
[59:59] mind I did every other thing but where
[1:00:01] is it today he said where do you please
[1:00:03] value them yes
[1:00:06] are we interested in ourselves
[1:00:09] okay and yet you find and we can have
[1:00:12] all the things we got our work and every
[1:00:13] other thing but that is not your God
[1:00:16] that is just you have to sustain you in
[1:00:18] this life amen but
[1:00:21] the world
[1:00:24] systems
[1:00:25] the evils everything will pass away
[1:00:29] okay so you find okay we you know we
[1:00:33] actually labor for things that will not
[1:00:36] perish
[1:00:37] okay so if I all these things he says is
[1:00:40] going to go
[1:00:42] why
[1:00:45] Christians must not love this evil World
[1:00:48] system because of its temporary
[1:00:51] age
[1:00:54] right I don't love it
[1:00:57] it will serve its purpose
[1:00:59] because it's only temporary
[1:01:02] right
[1:01:04] Daniel's prayer was with the hell for 21
[1:01:07] days imagine this great prophet
[1:01:09] so who are we in the side of Daniel
[1:01:12] we're not doing comparison as such but
[1:01:15] what I'm saying is the warfare that's
[1:01:16] going on
[1:01:17] Daniel okay
[1:01:20] due to an evil angel opposing Gabriel in
[1:01:26] Heavenly welfare
[1:01:29] tells us that Satan engages in Heavenly
[1:01:32] Warfare to influence generations and
[1:01:35] generations against God and his people
[1:01:38] it was quite busy
[1:01:41] you can't put all over Satan's eye
[1:01:45] right
[1:01:47] so yeah we're fine so we're speaking now
[1:01:49] this you know looking at this on my
[1:01:51] ego's perspective we find that salvation
[1:01:54] is
[1:01:55] transformed
[1:01:57] right
[1:01:58] and you find transformation is the new
[1:02:03] birth
[1:02:05] produces a new life you see I'm born
[1:02:08] again with the life amen okay you can
[1:02:11] say I'm born again you look yes with
[1:02:14] wisdom life amen amen all right he
[1:02:16] produces New Life in which the power of
[1:02:19] sin has been broken
[1:02:22] okay
[1:02:23] so I want you to watch and you watch you
[1:02:26] know you and I in this fight we're
[1:02:28] battling it out
[1:02:30] but remember we're on the victory side
[1:02:32] amen don't don't you know just give in
[1:02:36] to what Satan is trying to tell you so
[1:02:38] just look at this a little bit now how
[1:02:40] do we know we're going to teach a
[1:02:41] message on the unwelcomed Christ
[1:02:45] so you know actually that's what we say
[1:02:48] sometimes
[1:02:49] if we don't know the dress right the
[1:02:51] same Christ you're not welcome
[1:02:54] we don't want to talk right you're not
[1:02:56] welcome yes
[1:02:58] yes okay but imagine when we do these
[1:03:00] things as Christ is sitting there what's
[1:03:02] he gonna do
[1:03:03] how you will speak
[1:03:06] so Jesus was invited by Simon the
[1:03:09] Pharisee
[1:03:10] and then watch this
[1:03:12] Prophet attitude tells us to make fun of
[1:03:14] him
[1:03:15] hmm
[1:03:17] inviting Jesus because remember the
[1:03:20] Pharisees they didn't want anything to
[1:03:22] do Jesus they always criticize him and
[1:03:25] they mocked him under every other thing
[1:03:26] to him and so we find out this is what
[1:03:28] happens
[1:03:30] when we find out you know you find every
[1:03:33] time when Satan thinks he's doing
[1:03:35] something that he can turn the church
[1:03:36] down
[1:03:38] whether somebody there to stand out as a
[1:03:40] testimony because the infamous woman
[1:03:45] yes
[1:03:46] with the alabaster box of oil but
[1:03:48] nothing is
[1:03:50] perfume
[1:03:52] so how did he what happened perfume
[1:03:55] smell is influencing and penetrating
[1:03:58] so when she did this an old house she
[1:04:01] washed his feet and all these things and
[1:04:04] she she done service to him
[1:04:07] okay there's always somebody
[1:04:11] that will show you what truth is no
[1:04:15] matter how much the Devil comes to 12.
[1:04:18] it was a cloud around things
[1:04:22] and what did she do while the others mob
[1:04:25] Jesus the ill-fame woman done a great
[1:04:28] honor it is amen amen
[1:04:32] okay what are you doing to honor him
[1:04:35] this morning
[1:04:38] but you watch this very carefully
[1:04:41] we know the Pharisees hated Jesus
[1:04:44] then he shows us in the types and
[1:04:47] shadows you know Joseph and his brother
[1:04:49] and all these kind of the things
[1:04:51] right hated
[1:04:53] Jesus but
[1:04:56] invited him look at that what an
[1:04:59] audacity hate him but he invited him
[1:05:03] okay we hate you but will Pharisee means
[1:05:07] an actor so Prophet daughters right he's
[1:05:09] an actor so he said you know what we're
[1:05:11] hating but just act this out they're
[1:05:13] like we love him
[1:05:15] we'll call him
[1:05:18] but what does the prophet tell us he
[1:05:20] says you know there's something wrong
[1:05:22] with the story it's something is wrong
[1:05:26] with this story
[1:05:29] okay
[1:05:31] what did the Pharisee have in common
[1:05:33] with Jesus let's see
[1:05:36] the way you calling Jesus
[1:05:39] right that's where you find people
[1:05:43] actually supposed to have things in
[1:05:45] common then you'll find and congregate
[1:05:47] together yes amen
[1:05:49] why is you coming here this morning if
[1:05:51] we love the Lord amen
[1:05:53] I told you not come to see so and so now
[1:05:55] I was dressed with what or whatever
[1:05:58] you come here to meet the Lord amen okay
[1:06:02] that's our purpose we love the Lord
[1:06:04] so we go to church we have a common
[1:06:07] ground
[1:06:09] right now it's like this you know
[1:06:13] you know like you'll find little
[1:06:16] children have things in common
[1:06:19] you'll find a seven year a seven and
[1:06:22] eight-year-old children You'll Always
[1:06:24] Find they accept each other you know why
[1:06:26] they got something important
[1:06:29] right like one time you know now we're
[1:06:32] not saying I like the elderly people
[1:06:34] shouldn't uh associate with the younger
[1:06:37] ones and things like that or be befriend
[1:06:39] them or whatever we're not saying that
[1:06:41] but you know one time at work and we are
[1:06:42] just working colleagues and this one
[1:06:45] fellow was there and this other guy was
[1:06:47] the supervisor she was part of an
[1:06:51] elderly family we had some youngsters
[1:06:53] working there as well as you'll find
[1:06:55] always this you know absolutely
[1:06:57] supervisors will always go you know
[1:07:00] you'll be around those young fellows so
[1:07:02] other fellow was about the supervisor's
[1:07:05] age he turned around told us he says
[1:07:07] look at this fellow oh who is going
[1:07:09] there with this young family you know
[1:07:10] with their kind of a jokes and all this
[1:07:12] thing why it shows you know that someone
[1:07:14] seem to be no compatibility all right so
[1:07:18] what is it teaching us Isaiah told us
[1:07:21] little children pray playing in the
[1:07:24] streets his little children
[1:07:28] okay so little children attract little
[1:07:31] children
[1:07:32] so I wanted to run and say he says you
[1:07:35] know what in Germany he says little
[1:07:38] Americans and little Germans play
[1:07:41] together he didn't say there was a
[1:07:43] segregation because I'm American I would
[1:07:46] not be with the children they probably
[1:07:47] know nothing about nothing but they were
[1:07:50] of that same age that same group and
[1:07:53] they started playing together
[1:07:56] solution now the point is what does
[1:08:00] Simon the Pharisee have to do with Jesus
[1:08:03] that's why people remember him say
[1:08:05] there's something wrong with the study
[1:08:08] right
[1:08:09] then young women have things in common
[1:08:13] the middle age have things in common
[1:08:16] old people have things in common
[1:08:20] all right so let's come a little more I
[1:08:23] wouldn't say deeper but there's a
[1:08:25] our senses are good buzzards can talk
[1:08:28] about some old Partners dead Partners
[1:08:31] somewhere
[1:08:33] all right all right Sinners talk about
[1:08:36] the big dances and parties how was your
[1:08:38] parties how was your dances
[1:08:41] Sinners talk about that
[1:08:44] Sinners talk about big dances and
[1:08:46] parties
[1:08:47] all right Christians talk about
[1:08:49] wholesome things
[1:08:52] all right and good things
[1:08:56] and sinners talk about dirty things you
[1:09:00] don't even want to be with them why your
[1:09:02] diet is different amen yes
[1:09:06] the unwelcome Christ
[1:09:09] foreign
[1:09:13] he said what do they do to my Lord
[1:09:16] and the prophet cried and he cried
[1:09:22] all right
[1:09:23] creatures of the night and fellowship
[1:09:26] and darkness
[1:09:27] the Sun that the night creatures
[1:09:30] they can't have fellowship with the
[1:09:32] creatures of the day
[1:09:35] they just can't
[1:09:37] so what Fellowship did the Pharisee have
[1:09:40] with Jesus
[1:09:42] this point again remember it was
[1:09:45] customary before Jesus could step into
[1:09:48] the house now Frankie was at the door at
[1:09:51] the door
[1:09:53] right the point is
[1:09:58] how did you receive because when
[1:10:00] everyone comes in and goes around turns
[1:10:02] back and said but he was Mr Jones's feet
[1:10:04] yeah
[1:10:06] it's like a political setup
[1:10:10] so here you find everything is all set
[1:10:12] up and the slang is in purposely
[1:10:15] I know I'll pretend obviously this
[1:10:18] anointing of the Pharisees you must be
[1:10:19] always one of them too
[1:10:21] the actors who pretend I didn't even see
[1:10:25] this man so he goes in Jesus is so dirty
[1:10:28] feet
[1:10:29] all right
[1:10:30] and he goes into the dining hall and he
[1:10:34] sits there and here comes this woman
[1:10:37] an infinite woman
[1:10:40] a woman that had a bad name in society
[1:10:43] nobody wanted to look at her
[1:10:47] right what did she do
[1:10:51] and Jesus sitting at the table would
[1:10:53] unwashed feet he washed the feet he said
[1:10:56] of Dr Jones and all the other
[1:10:58] dignitaries
[1:11:00] and Jesus Takes second or third place
[1:11:04] a ball with you when you persisted in
[1:11:10] oh I tell you
[1:11:11] you say you love him you only love him
[1:11:15] because he first loves you amen
[1:11:19] right
[1:11:21] so yeah
[1:11:23] so the old Story Goes to say and the
[1:11:26] prophet is telling us the woman you know
[1:11:29] had an opportunity
[1:11:32] but don't miss it you alsoever yes amen
[1:11:36] hallelujah somebody said what will you
[1:11:43] what will you do neutral you cannot be
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:47] okay someday your soul will be asking
[1:11:51] what will he do
[1:11:57] you love the Lord this morning amen okay
[1:12:00] let's go to one or two things
[1:12:02] in your time
[1:12:14] a bit
[1:12:16] all right so we find
[1:12:19] okay yeah we watch okay watching this uh
[1:12:23] you know from
[1:12:25] prophet's perspective another Eagle's
[1:12:28] perspective and here you find actually
[1:12:33] we find
[1:12:36] Prophet tells us you know the church
[1:12:38] needs a bird
[1:12:41] and not a facelift
[1:12:46] it's not going to help you amen but you
[1:12:49] need a bit amen born again
[1:12:52] all right the Bible speaks about being
[1:12:54] begotten again that's born again yeah
[1:12:58] all right so you find that's what we
[1:13:01] really need okay this is one of two
[1:13:03] things but some things that I want to
[1:13:05] just miss is very very uh important
[1:13:09] right
[1:13:11] okay so we're watching uh
[1:13:14] all these things
[1:13:17] okay okay so we're looking let's let's
[1:13:19] just touch a little on this but we say
[1:13:21] we find
[1:13:22] I'm gonna look at that woman all right
[1:13:24] so she's busy watching feet and she
[1:13:28] anoints him
[1:13:30] the Bible says you know she uh even with
[1:13:33] the hair should wipe his feet do all
[1:13:36] these things
[1:13:38] well he shares and opportunity he said
[1:13:40] you and I also have opportunities today
[1:13:43] God
[1:13:45] once our fellowship this morning
[1:13:49] okay
[1:13:50] and fellowship must not be artificial
[1:13:52] yes amen okay
[1:13:55] uh
[1:13:56] was would anybody else
[1:14:00] Fellowship was not friendship
[1:14:02] you can have a lot of friends
[1:14:04] but very few that you're going to have
[1:14:06] fellowship with yes all right
[1:14:10] so you find Fellowship you must be
[1:14:12] transparent you must be honest
[1:14:16] okay like the Pharisees lots of people
[1:14:19] are pretending in all walks of life
[1:14:23] also people are pretending in all walks
[1:14:26] of life
[1:14:28] well we find we human beings are like
[1:14:30] this but it's not good because some
[1:14:32] people can only fellowship with
[1:14:34] graduates yeah graduates fellowshipping
[1:14:37] with graduates all right
[1:14:40] but Paul I fellowship with the Greeks
[1:14:42] and The Barbarians
[1:14:45] the uncultured the uneducated and the
[1:14:48] uncivilized what's that great Apostolic
[1:14:52] just to touch that year and there this
[1:14:55] morning okay now let's come to this some
[1:14:57] some kind of sovereign things God must
[1:15:00] help us there was a church one time
[1:15:02] Minister began to say you know
[1:15:05] the church you see that there's one
[1:15:08] particular time he says uh I will say
[1:15:11] his church all right he used to fast
[1:15:14] every Saturday that's a very Gallant
[1:15:16] thing right every Saturday they will
[1:15:19] fast
[1:15:21] all right and what they would do they
[1:15:23] would read their Bible on their knees
[1:15:28] such reverence for the word of God
[1:15:31] right actually what do we do we stand we
[1:15:34] read in the Bible these are all
[1:15:35] scriptural things right but these people
[1:15:37] say you know what we will go on our
[1:15:38] knees with a fast wait on the Lord right
[1:15:42] now these are honest people so the most
[1:15:44] is a very honest man
[1:15:46] but he wondered why the people do
[1:15:52] this you can go through all the emotions
[1:15:54] sometimes
[1:15:55] no change yes new life amen yes no but
[1:16:00] yeah
[1:16:01] what has happened
[1:16:03] and people are doing this every Saturday
[1:16:07] you know for most people Saturday is a
[1:16:09] very busy day with the
[1:16:11] uh you know only
[1:16:14] things that people do on a Saturday is
[1:16:16] people with a great sacrifice
[1:16:19] you said I wondered why they did not
[1:16:23] change
[1:16:24] he says in a way
[1:16:27] backbiting
[1:16:28] they were still hating they were still
[1:16:31] doing all these things that is why there
[1:16:34] wasn't a change
[1:16:38] so the Lord told him
[1:16:41] God told this man I believe you've been
[1:16:43] an honest man so God told this man he
[1:16:47] was spending time with the book
[1:16:50] but not with him
[1:16:53] even when we meditate we don't meditate
[1:16:56] on the Lord but our uh our minds are on
[1:16:59] other things of Fellowship John says the
[1:17:04] eagle must be with the father and the
[1:17:07] son amen amen
[1:17:12] all right so by the way it is in passing
[1:17:15] so I came across this one time
[1:17:17] and they said there was a certain
[1:17:19] Methodist Church maybe in that Iran
[1:17:22] that's what they did
[1:17:23] but I want to show you the respect they
[1:17:25] add so what they used to do in kind of
[1:17:27] Bibles today lots of our Bibles my pages
[1:17:30] might have dogs years they say it also
[1:17:33] might be covered with dust
[1:17:35] all right because it depends how long
[1:17:37] you've read our Bibles we're supposed to
[1:17:39] be in love with him all right so we do
[1:17:42] all these things rather we don't do what
[1:17:44] we're supposed to be doing but what
[1:17:45] these people used to do this Methodist
[1:17:47] people they have the word of God to such
[1:17:49] I esteem they will have the Bible locked
[1:17:53] up in a special room
[1:17:55] and when the service starts all right
[1:17:58] the time for reading the Bible they will
[1:18:00] have the Bible wheeled into the church
[1:18:04] will the Bible in
[1:18:07] he felt unworthy to even hold the Bible
[1:18:11] it was real in the Bible was read
[1:18:13] whatever was read was taken back and
[1:18:17] locked
[1:18:18] into him
[1:18:21] how precious is the word of God
[1:18:24] all right amen okay this is closed now a
[1:18:28] little bit okay
[1:18:31] really finish off this morning
[1:18:35] okay
[1:18:36] so they'll be fine
[1:18:38] so look just as a as a testimony maybe
[1:18:42] it's a bit out of the subject but maybe
[1:18:43] somebody needs this amen or we all need
[1:18:45] it right so we find one time brother
[1:18:49] Brian was mother-in-law a clock did not
[1:18:52] work
[1:18:53] all right you know in those days that
[1:18:55] people are very poor and couldn't afford
[1:18:57] it
[1:18:57] much of these things but we find that
[1:19:00] she could not do without a clock
[1:19:03] right she didn't have the money to buy
[1:19:05] another clock
[1:19:07] it should go down
[1:19:09] and read
[1:19:11] when she looked up the clock worked
[1:19:14] perfectly
[1:19:17] with God yeah she must say I would
[1:19:20] really add a true relationship with the
[1:19:23] Lord right a couple of days after that a
[1:19:26] fridge kept defrosting
[1:19:28] she didn't have the money to buy another
[1:19:30] fridge she said Lord will you be
[1:19:33] merciful to me again she got up and
[1:19:35] looked the refrigerator he says it froze
[1:19:39] all around it worked perfectly
[1:19:44] so what is he saying don't mentally
[1:19:46] figure it out just believe it amen with
[1:19:49] your soul all right on the message on
[1:19:52] the uncertain sound and by the way this
[1:19:55] is
[1:19:57] amen
[1:19:58] Hallelujah story of that creature
[1:20:00] remember the Bible said
[1:20:02] preach the gospel to every creature
[1:20:06] not only human beings now
[1:20:08] you know the prophet stories we know all
[1:20:11] of that but let's because a little bit
[1:20:14] right now here comes this opposium that
[1:20:18] came to the prophet's door that creature
[1:20:21] all right
[1:20:22] came together if you really look at the
[1:20:25] story you find by the way it was a fifth
[1:20:28] house which was the prophet saws he left
[1:20:30] four other houses yeah
[1:20:32] past four other houses and he came to
[1:20:34] the fifth house
[1:20:36] what told this teacher amen there's a
[1:20:38] picture here there's a prophet there's
[1:20:41] the ego here
[1:20:42] all right so we find so
[1:20:46] and you know we are told the other
[1:20:49] houses were closer to him
[1:20:51] he left all of that
[1:20:54] okay
[1:20:55] the right thing we find in the mental
[1:20:59] realm of sociality
[1:21:01] the right thing was to kill it because
[1:21:02] his life was almost gone
[1:21:05] it was something Prophet says was down
[1:21:07] here wouldn't let me do it
[1:21:11] okay he says soul
[1:21:14] okay
[1:21:16] Mark 16 said preach the prosecutor every
[1:21:19] creature
[1:21:21] animals and human beings
[1:21:24] she Mo she knew more than the preachers
[1:21:28] that denied Divine Healing preachers and
[1:21:31] with the deity whatever they call it
[1:21:33] they deny Divine you know she knew more
[1:21:35] than them never went to school
[1:21:38] you know with God it doesn't really
[1:21:41] matter
[1:21:42] you can be educated with God is nothing
[1:21:45] all right even if you're uneducated with
[1:21:48] God is nothing now with men down here it
[1:21:50] means something but not from God amen
[1:21:52] amen that's why it took a seventh
[1:21:54] prophet of the seventh grade education
[1:21:56] and he said you'll go around the world
[1:21:59] with around the world seven times
[1:22:01] you confronted and you know even prayed
[1:22:04] for monarchs and great people
[1:22:07] so she knew more about the preachers she
[1:22:13] followed the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:22:16] to go to the prophet's door if God could
[1:22:19] do that to an oppism how much more could
[1:22:22] he do it to you amen hallelujah there's
[1:22:25] an ego perspective this morning that
[1:22:27] we're looking at all right
[1:22:31] brother in the message uncertain sound
[1:22:35] he says Saint Francis of Assisi while he
[1:22:38] was preaching he told the birds to keep
[1:22:43] preach the gospel
[1:22:45] preach the gospel to every teacher that
[1:22:48] the Virgin at that point
[1:22:51] okay so we find
[1:22:53] now
[1:22:57] like you said you know
[1:22:59] you said uh
[1:23:07] okay
[1:23:08] we're coming back to that you know what
[1:23:10] John was saying everything else would
[1:23:13] pass the world will
[1:23:17] remember Peter told us he says you know
[1:23:19] I saw the evidence of the Earth the role
[1:23:21] as a scroll
[1:23:23] okay and of course he tells us about the
[1:23:25] new world come in
[1:23:29] why is all passes away
[1:23:32] so what I told you this morning we will
[1:23:34] see our loved once again
[1:23:36] amen
[1:23:37] whatever says I will give a hundred
[1:23:40] million dollars to talk to my dad will
[1:23:43] pass on for just one hour
[1:23:48] right
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:51] just for one hour
[1:23:53] so you turn back and see what is money
[1:23:55] worth
[1:23:57] how much more is a soul than money
[1:24:01] the world is passing away
[1:24:03] the evil eye had caught
[1:24:08] okay so he says nobody's fault if I
[1:24:11] found one piece
[1:24:13] he says you know I can't find it what
[1:24:16] you say rather he says I wonder will you
[1:24:19] please value
[1:24:21] I turned back he said even he at times
[1:24:23] because he had to work on a on a Sunday
[1:24:26] all right
[1:24:28] he says but then you know
[1:24:30] he says I appreciated it appreciate a
[1:24:33] little time to work and you can get a
[1:24:35] little more money
[1:24:36] you see because I was in debt he said I
[1:24:39] wasn't dead
[1:24:40] but he says where did it get me
[1:24:43] where did that get me
[1:24:46] all right so all these things this
[1:24:49] morning is really really going to pass
[1:24:55] right so let's close this one quote
[1:25:00] on the handwriting on the wall
[1:25:03] right the world we said evil will system
[1:25:08] all right like somebody was saying you
[1:25:11] know sometimes you know
[1:25:13] people
[1:25:14] you can talk about our children both
[1:25:17] about their children and all these kind
[1:25:19] of things right and then they wonder why
[1:25:23] isn't my children spiritual
[1:25:27] return back and says you know what
[1:25:29] because you let them to feed on this
[1:25:33] evil World System
[1:25:35] how do you expect them to be spiritual
[1:25:42] okay so we find out the devil wants to
[1:25:44] keep you from being born again
[1:25:47] don't let him explain it away
[1:25:50] born again is a real experience every
[1:25:54] one of us must have that experience
[1:25:57] right so handwriting on the wall
[1:26:01] it says worldliness speaking on
[1:26:03] worldliness is he says Church flowing
[1:26:08] would list resistance
[1:26:12] are we in that category
[1:26:14] when the Wilderness is going so strong
[1:26:18] but the church is just flowing not
[1:26:21] resisting it with least resistance
[1:26:26] stand up for the system and says you
[1:26:29] know what he says the Rapture is an end
[1:26:32] yeah Okay so we've got to redefine our
[1:26:35] rightful
[1:26:36] position there's much here for as I said
[1:26:38] from the ego's perspective it actually
[1:26:41] brings us higher into Revelation amen
[1:26:44] all right like we said Revelation
[1:26:46] remember now
[1:26:47] Revelation seals have been opened all
[1:26:50] these Prophet auras since the seals were
[1:26:52] open the Bible became a new amen
[1:26:55] hallelujah you see we look at things
[1:26:57] differently we look at different Eagle's
[1:26:59] perspective from the view of an eagle
[1:27:02] shall we just pray God bless you thank
[1:27:05] you for your patience
[1:27:07] foreign
[1:27:20] by this morning you know we we need him
[1:27:25] okay this is not anybody to look around
[1:27:27] just going to ask people to bow in
[1:27:29] prayer I won't even be looking around if
[1:27:32] you feel you know you need prayer in
[1:27:34] some way this morning you can raise your
[1:27:36] hand to the Lord and I just want to pray
[1:27:39] let's find forgive me dear God in heaven
[1:27:42] Lord we thank you we have nothing to
[1:27:44] fear
[1:27:45] because your word is the ultimate
[1:27:48] and Lord what we do
[1:27:50] is by our best of our knowledge and
[1:27:52] understanding trying to present these
[1:27:55] things to your children
[1:27:57] Lord Jesus in the end we want to be one
[1:28:00] bless family in heaven

[1:29:13] eagles gathered together amen under the
[1:29:16] revealed word of the hour you know
[1:29:18] there's something about eagles they saw
[1:29:20] above the things of this world

[1:29:25] chickens you're flying too low
[1:29:27] amen if your Association is with

[1:29:45] is a stimulation of Revelation amen
[1:29:47] hallelujah so certainly you were blessed
[1:29:49] this morning amen amen an ego's
[1:29:52] perspective amen hallelujah and we know
[1:29:55] that we were typing John

[1:30:01] seeing it in reality form John saw it in
[1:30:04] symbol form with the bride are seeing it
[1:30:06] in reality form amen think of it John
[1:30:09] when he's writing about Revelation 10 he
[1:30:12] is writing about a mighty angel coming
[1:30:13] down and the prophet Revelation 10 7 he
[1:30:17] is only writing it in simple form how
[1:30:19] privileged are you and I to be seeing it
[1:30:21] in Revelation form when it's being
[1:30:24] revealed when it's being unfolded and
