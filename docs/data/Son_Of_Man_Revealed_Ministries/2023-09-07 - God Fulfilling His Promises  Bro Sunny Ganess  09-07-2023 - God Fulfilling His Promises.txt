yes because he's chosen he's a hey yeah he's a head joint here and you can take it and this morning we look at Abraham Abraham the promise came the promise came and it had to be fulfilled yes and not fulfilled in Abraham's day there was a fulfillment in Abraham's day but the Fulfillment had to come right to this day amen this day that we are living in the Fulfillment of the promise had to come in this day so therefore we're going to look now this morning we're going to take right from the beginning what happened and now the promise came and we're going to bring it down and break it down right here to this day amen praise the Lord You're Happy God has given us a good weather yes so the Pastor said if I go halfway that will be one hour so he'll take over the next hour praise the Lord amen praise the Lord this lungs is getting bigger and bigger amen hallelujah praise the Lord there's nothing on this side but there's something on this side hey man you see praise the Lord thank you you see Abraham he was living with his parents in Babylon and now you see God speaks can you say here I never hear God Speak you know why you don't hear God Speak because you don't speak to you and that's the only reason why yes you can't hear him speak amen yes and I've been struggling to get a message I've been struggling to get a message because I've been preaching for hey long I had a good holiday yeah you know I was enjoying everything that was coming there I always try to run away from this place I never in all my life in the preaching of this gospel never looked for a Pulpit God always found the pulpit amen he said because if you've got to preach God and find you the people yes if you've got to preach you'll put the bridge in you yes if you got the preach you'll find a Pulpit for you amen praise the Lord it depends what you do from the pulpit amen you see that is why they call it Pulpit yeah because you need to pull people out of the pits or you could pull them down into the pit yeah so that's what happened I was living with his parents and you know what parents are we all live like that I'm sure the new generation don't know it the old generation knowing mother father children mother-in-law's daughter-in-laws everybody stayed all together in laws never fight Partners love their mother-in-laws mother-in-laws love their daughter-in-laws son-in-laws love their mother-in-laws they never fight amen one house you found 10 people living in there 20 people living in one house and they lived so one morning even I'm caught up he had a vision separate yourself yes I have chosen you hallelujah amen I have chosen you amen you you was also there yes right there yes right in the denomination yes he totally made from seeds now I'm telling you to get up and start to move amen glory to God and you know in the old days what happened when the sun packed up his bag and say mommy I'm leaving with my wife the whole house is crying yes the whole Lounge is crying my son where you going how are you gonna make it we all stay together we ate together we're everything together but you bring now you're going like the old people will know this is what happened in the crying son where are you going I don't know where I am but I'm going I heard that voice yes and I'm following that voice amen hallelujah hallelujah can you follow that voice amen can you follow that voice this morning I'm hearing that voice hey you know what is bags and everything packed and he says now I'm gonna move you know a lot what's his nephew and he saw how Abraham was living that's why sometimes you at home you have to be the example yes there's an uncle good uncle yes you must have been a good uncle yeah so not today hold it I want to join you I'm going to join you I'm going to move with you yeah yeah so Lord decided to go with him now and that's what and him journeyed hey they came to Egypt when he came to Egypt what happened then Abraham saw hey Sarah was looking too terrific said I was looking too terrible she had a figure like a trigger you know that same problem hurry gonna kill me he's gonna kill me because and then it's going to take you you know it was lawful that time yeah he said you know what just tell him you're my sister see God calling somebody and this somebody is telling a lie and he's supposed to be a prophet yeah and now we've got people here now in our place now telling us hey William Brandon is not a prophet because this is not right that's not right that's not right so now this page I'm tear it out from my Bible now because Abraham is not a prophet anymore you see we must learn to understand what God wants us to do yes when God calls a man he calls a man irrespective of the circumstances he takes him in amen so now Abram lets his wife go what happens there now hey I can just imagine Abraham Lincoln ate this man yeah he's with my wife he's with my wife but he allowed it but you see the god that we serve no matter what the circumstances in your life amen he will not leave you amen we will not forsake you he will be with you yes all the days of yours amen when he calls you he calls you to finish your work amen and he is going to finish the work irrespective of what happens now the King was troubled all night it comes to England you're telling me why did you tell me this is your sister when did you tell me this is my wife he says I was afraid now what happened the thing you have to pack him up hey put all this food and the rest of the things you see God is is fulfilling his promise I'm calling you to a land amen how are you going to get there you can't get there by starvation yeah so it fulfills the promise yes right there the king had to give him all the things send him off and he goes on the journey and he goes on the journey and then they come to a place it's Aaron and they stayed there and then what happened we find that you see sometimes when God calls the separation he's not calling your mother yeah you're not calling your father you're not calling your brother not calling your sister he's calling you amen amen yes amen amen nobody can go yeah amen calling you amen I mean he calls you yeah you must go amen don't decide to carry a table Yeah you see yeah same thing happened in the Garden of Eden see the disciple came with a fork tongue and he came with a long tail you see so don't carry a tail with you if God called you he calls you amen despise all the others and go forward amen he will bless you yes yes so yeah he was and they had to have a separation again you have to have a separation again yes right a lot a lot of things the Bible says he was blessed also yes you see how your blessing you could bless other people yes because of you the people are blessed Because Of You the people are blessed in this country yes if God takes away the bride the country is gone yes that's what the prophet said it's because of the Bride you are here and you stay here and as long as you are yeah there is no judgment on the land yes and when the bride gets off the land judgment amen yeah now Lord and Abraham and Abraham was a just man that is why he was called a friend of God and there was one place I think he was called the the the the mighty Prince friend of God Mighty Prince look at the titles yes God can give you titles amen you see so they had to separate Abraham was thick called him and said son we need to separate you look decide wherever you look and you take it could have told him listen I'm your uncle you go this side and I'll go this side it was only fair it was on the uncle and the pastor I can tell you what to do right you can go this side I won't go this side no what you call the congregation together hallelujah amen never made a decision amen he called the congregation together and that's when a true Pastor will do call his congregation together amen and let us reason amen you see time for fighting and all that is over that's right you can't fight amen fighting is over yeah people are

going overboard yeah yeah when you tell them how to live yes you're overboard that's with the house too in the house in your own house yeah country a little bit a little bit you know a little bit I used a little bit too too Sinjin that's what happened so this is what it is so say hey you know what son hey this is got jealous they took him 23. and then the midianite the journeyman came bought him off and he took him away Joseph hey this is seemed to be like a totally out of cater everything is allocated now hey what my dreams were who's gonna bow down to me I'm going I don't know where I'm going but in his journey of God who did Amen in your journey never be afraid no matter what the circumstance are like your journey will call me yes so we're going to end it up all know the story he ended up there Egypt and he became 41st for the right hand man and then he ended up in the dungeon Joseph ended up in the dungeons and while in the dungeons what happened there were two men dead yes yeah but everything doesn't seem right but people have to bow down to you you're supposed to be like a king but now you're in a dungeon you see God never forgets his promise nothing comes easy every child of God have to be tested every child of God Amen Christ amen amen if you have to be tired you have to be tested to receive your blessing Amen to receive your honor you have to be tested you have to be tried now Joseph is in the dungeon and they had a dream those of us be able to hear interpret the dream and so the one that should die the one had to go out but he said you know what when you grow up you remember me you remember me now he was reminding him to say the king this is what I am after that many years went by a lot of time went by hey hold it now hey this is all his dreams and everything we're not located they were not right but one day they had to call for him when the king energy so he came up when there's a dream was for free fulfilled in the time of famine these brothers that you come you see they were all supposed to perish but God was fulfilling his promise amen amen to Joseph amen it was fulfilling the promise to Joseph amen because Joseph had to look after them during the time of famine amen Joseph forgot everything because he was christ-like yeah amen you see sometimes we can forgive but you can't forget one guy was telling me I can't forget he said I think about it I have to forget you see but Joseph never worry called his brothers he was happy to see his brothers yeah and he sustained them during the time of the famine yes yeah we're going to go through the way he went to his father and all that that's another story we'll say at three till three o'clock but that's what it was God fulfilling his brother amen yes not letting the Royal Seed of Abraham to die amen and throughout the journey right up to now the Royal Seed of Abraham will continue praise the Lord because he is the one that is sustainable amen that is keeping it through amen now Joseph sustain them through the time but this came a Time well a new federal rules you pick that up in Exodus one go home and read it see what preachers preach they've got no time to go through all that things unless if he's teaching a teacher will come and teach you but the preacher will preach yeah and set your life so now you pick it up in Exodus one the new Pharaoh came in and forgot about what Joseph's promise was what they promised Joseph and the people and they said now these people here whatever we're doing to them they multiplying right yeah they are just multiplying one of these days they're going to overcome and they're going to take over our land they were afraid they were afraid that is why you see the denomination will tell the people hey don't join these people yeah don't join them because they take you away you see because why they are afraid because you have the power amen yes that's the only reason they are afraid because you have the power of God so they'll tell you don't join these people I remember when we first came in the message hey I'm speaking to these people they want to talk to me they don't want to talk to me so what happened they say our Pastor said must have nothing to do with y'all you see you don't have nothing to do that is what happened to the Egyptians now they were afraid people are they reckon then they said okay the Pharaoh said no don't worry we will deal with them in a different way persecution persecution time there is persecution when this bride is just about to leave that was the first Exodus when this bride is about to leave you must remember the squeeze is going to be on yeah don't think everything is going to be sweet so that is why preachers are preparing you ministers are preparing you every time they come here no matter how long it is no matter how how how little it is yeah just grasp whatever because what you eat what you eat that makes you healthy you know today we pampered this body so much hey we don't want to eat this but don't eat that we don't want this please take this mix turmeric powder olive oil and do this do that don't take too much of this don't eat too much beef don't

where I'm in my notes to now praise the Lord everything seems to be gone the children of Israel Children of the Hebrew children hey the people okay you know what this promise 400 years and This Promise is not coming there's no promise but then all of a sudden God Rose of Moses yeah we're not going to go through the Moses in the basket or we're going to talk about the Moses that met the god in the burning board that's right Hallelujah talking about the Moses I trust the Sunday School teachers will do that job to come back what happened who told the people who told the whole of Israel who told the whole the Hebrew children all the Hebrew people took on Gather in Goshen the Breakthrough who told him that was only God amen amen one of these days We Shall Gather By The River amen hallelujah are we going to break loose amen hallelujah we're gonna split the skies we're going to meet him at the Easter amen hallelujah hallelujah you know and here was Moses Leading the People What stopped The Exodus What stopped them from getting to the land as quickly as possible four days I suppose the prophets 40 years in the wilderness because of the memory yes amen they were not ready yeah God was willing to fulfill his promise but the people were not ready when they got their freedom they saw the Red Sea opening what a miracle that is the sea to split up like we're going to split the Eastern Skies hallelujah amen [Music] walking through Thailand see on this side of mountain and the Sea of the site to go into a try that what a miracle but yet when they got on the other side they'd still complained completely complete not much more Prophet left us so much yes he why the Rapture not taking place the prophet said it might be 1977. he didn't say it's going to be 1997. he said I pursue oh I suppose I predict yeah be 1997. but why because we were in this we are in the same condition as an Israelites with the left Egypt yes that's right we are memory memory my brother missed my sister this message is straight amen he's got nothing to Boggle your mind the only thing that people are doing today in this message they are boggling the people's minds you know why because they've got nothing to give the people the way why the prophet had left them so much they've got nothing to give them so they're boggling the people's mind coming here and talking High words let a poor person they never went to school now you telling the high words to him or she now she's sitting down there she said I don't know what's happening this is a simple the prophet preached it so much amen you better read the message it's so simple yeah yeah Kentucky language broken language not like our older our old grannies and all used to talk you know when he's coming to talk that kind of language he spoke yeah today you're coming and giving intellectuals people yeah we don't need intellectual speeches still injuring the people and the people are moaning groaning you know ah it's it's really really really you know it makes my heart so I've seen it through my brother my sister I've seen it through I've come wrong way with this my brother was living he would have been here to tell you more of it but today people have not yet stopped the time is now to stop amen and look up amen for your Redemption Hallelujah while they were Journey you see these things happen they went they did their own things we had the same procedure coming through in the last Exodus people are going off in disabled or going off from that angle but God told us to walk straight amen Prophet told us to walk straight you see all these delays all these delays are just for us to know that we must get ready and the only time it will happen if we get ready the Rapture will take place amen you see and then God rules up Moses for that day we come along and we see God had to raise somebody in that day and when the time time came Joshua knew Joshua had a vision of Jericho falling yeah yeah the vision yeah he knew he knew that is why I had so much of so much of Courage he knew so they crossed over while they cross over he stood in the hand while they're crossing over we find the Jews were now in a place concentrated and then they had to raise somebody else to save them the promise and the promise had to come but how the promises come there's so much obstacles yeah there's obstacles on the way our promise is there but there's obstacles on the way and here was amen he wanted to finish off all the Jews and if you finish up all the juice then where's the promise there's no promise King Azeroth was a king amen was in charge but is she gone in all his power and All His glory had to remove vasty yeah to fulfill his promise amen you have to remove vasty took busty out of the sea yeah so Esther could get in amen hallelujah if you're having a struggle if you're having a struggle don't fear yeah because God will open the way amen he'll remove your vastly yes he will remove you don't have to remove it he will come and remove it and now there to be somebody to tell Esther hey oh did God had to raise a Mordecai to preserve his promise in order that he can fulfill This Promise he raised a Mordecai thank you in the time of distress it was a Mordecai and the Mordecai had to come there and tell Esther listen we're in trouble if all these if all of us are gone there is no Abraham's seed if all of us are gone there's no Abraham's seed yeah we all are finished yeah but God is never never ever going to allow his promise to fail yes amen allow his promise to me so he raises the Mordecai who comes there and Esther says okay what must I do he said your life is not safe too because amen will get you in the end so more gives the instructions any good he comes backwards certainly for three days when it comes back Esther is already ready you see gone working through her and she goes there and she says you know what she says to Mordecai listen I don't know my position I'm just a bride I'm just chosen The Pride you see a bride now she is chosen yeah but she can do what she likes because she's preparing she is preparing she's preparing for what for a wedding a bride is preparing for the wedding she'll be a bride until the wedding she might be one of this kind of shoes that kind of a dress she can do all that but while she is preparing God is speaking and Mordecai said you know what you have to go there and she never went there she never went there then she told Mordecai okay I'm prepared now if I go if it's okay but if I perish I perish but if I get it I will get it but if I perish I perish she was prepared to die amen today that's what should be your style to die for your faith you must be prepared to die for your faith now when she went in there she wasn't sure whether the king is going to accept her or whether the king is going to reject that you see but this morning you are sure yes of your standing you are sure of your standing and as he gets there she knocks at the door the door opens the king comes up anything hallelujah amen and you know I said what have I won I can give you half of my kingdom now he's declaring a 50 50. here to the throne hallelujah amen amen he's declaring the 50 50 already now I am prepared to give you half of the throne so which means there's a transition there now she's changing over from a bride to a wife Hallelujah doesn't that make you happy tonight amen she's not becoming your wife because no blight gets 50 50. yes which bride gets 50 50. you propose a man and she give you 50 50. you have to marry him and kill him and take his 50. you see no she says I cannot tell you now come to the communion table the banquet of wine when he gets there see she now knows she has Authority this wife of Jesus Christ Authority hallelujah

man yeah you said I wasted all my time and now I'm coming here you're telling me come tomorrow no no no no no this is not one maybe if you have to break this thing up we have to break it up because oh YouTube is going to be my wife every time you're going to do the same thing hey but the king said you know what I already offered at 50 50. she's always people all right Hallelujah Hallelujah you're already my wife all right I'll come tomorrow yeah we come the next day that's what you want he said spread the life of all my brothers and sisters and mine too Hallelujah he says who's troubling you this devil amen not amen amen Glory see how close it is the witch and the chair yeah says he's troubling me you see he prepared a yellow for Mordecai God will reverse the situation amen God never leaves you nor forsake you until the end of the world prepared the yellow for you the devil prepared The Gather for you but he had to take the yellow himself all is roaming around trying to get hold of you now what happened you see when people get married when they're standing there in the front every one of us know this right you take your vows you take your vows and after you take your vows you finish what the preacher does the future turns you around a couple he face you to the congregation and he tells you I now introduce you to Mr and Mrs Adrian gingan they married I now introduce you too Mr and Mrs Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so today there's been Brides brides churches churches we are in a transition we are moving on we are moving on my brother yes we are moving on my sister you see we are coming to the climax and to become the climax when do you have the marriage supper all of you all give the food first and then got married half of the people who have been gone yeah that's true you see in the funeral still to say go join the family and spend some time time with them people once they eat the meal they they're gone so that is why they give the supper after the wedding yeah so the wedding is on the marriage is on she's a wife she's not a bride anymore Hallelujah so you find from that time from the time of Isaiah to the time of Malachi that's 400 years yeah everything like government it seems that God's fulfilling must never fulfilled everybody lived in that age the mother said hey we heard as a Malachi as I are saying you know what the Virgin shall conceive D aside and his name Shall be Called counselor Mighty God Everlasting father man where is This Promise God is failing 400 years some of you are us now what is 50 years 50 years 50 years we want to manufacture you can't manufacture anything here my brother nothing the word will remain the word amen you just preach the word right amen and in this time it will happen amen you can't bring it before you can't take it after yeah in its time yeah and in this time that's going to happen other people must have said hey what happened then comes Malachi because there was no Prophet from that time to that time then comes Malachi but Malachi comes on the scene he says there will be a forerunner and there'll be Elijah yes yes but from that time to that time I think it was three hundred 400 300 years 300 years gone until the Holy Ghost came and spoke to Mary yes amen hallelujah amen prophet that's uh the angel Gabriel comes down speaks to to Mary and gives her the promise amen God in his Backpacker with his mind he had it there to redeem his people back to Eden amen amen yes we have to go back to the same condition yes so we are a redeemed people amen so what happened when that promise come it comes to Mary but we don't know what's going to happen nobody knows Simeon yes about it and he says you know what I I will not go the angel came and told him you can't die yes until you see yes what a promise amen you can't die till you see your savior amen you will never die you are Eternal amen you're the 10 will be hallelujah praise the Lord and now what happens as we go along we find we find that uh God fulfilling This Promise Here Comes Jesus Christ on the scene one day right at the temple everybody's pushing pushing Simeon comes out there and he sees he says now I've seen the savior of the world yes and now I can live amen hallelujah amen now I've seen the savior of the world and now I can leave God fulfilling his promise amen never letting his people down they fulfill This Promise amen Jesus comes he walks the Earth for three and a half years ministering the gospel Healing The Sick raising the Dead making the blind to see the to walk but the people can't see it they couldn't see it they will not ordain to see it yes there were people that were already in to see it saw it right at the cross when he went there everything was gone your salvation was met there right at the cross God fulfilling his promises taking the people back into the Eden to where they belong amen they belong to Eden yes the same condition the bride you see now we are in a training ground right we are in a training ground you see you don't go somewhere and don't perform you are in a training ground a prophet came trained us yes oh what a job in this last day in the sovereign we've been trained we've been trained in such a way we will go there and we will never have a problem we find there was a time when David when David was very sick he couldn't talk he was cold and then they brought everything the shulamite to keep him warm you see because they tried to manufacture something manufacture some heat but it never worked it never worked you see David was old and he was going to leave the scene that he would pick up in First Kings chapter one I'm closing First Kings chapter one and they brought in Abhishek and he told her to keep this man and he ministered to her to him and then what one of David's Sons by the Niger we got the people together you got some vaccinating preachers that's living priests got some generals who are not obedient to David he got them up and he took them and went and he wanted to self-proclaim himself King and Elijah self-proclaiming himself a king going and slaughtering and making a feast I am King we have many many energizers today yeah in this message self-proclaiming you can look at the denomination tell them saps I'm not going to say what it is they say peace we have them in the message too you young men if God called you to preach you will preach in your church yeah you'll be led by your pastor amen yeah he will see your ministry that's right and after seeing your ministry he will Proclaim you he will tell you Who You Are you can't fight and leave the church to God Minister somewhere else amen yeah that's true it's out of order amen this is energia this is adoniser You Preach in your church first that's right and when you finish preaching in your church you will know who you are yeah if God called you you will preach amen amen you will not go out there and do what you supposed to do right because yeah he was self-proclaiming and then you got some backslidden preachers too will take you and ordain you make you a pastor there's no two Pastors in one Church [Music] there's no two pastors people make that yeah you know the prophet said every church is a sovereign Church they will never pass it to lead the church amen if you want an example I'll give you an example here was a church there was a call for the pastor to go to Milltown remember the experience the military experience when he goes there he looks around finds a deliberated church trying to find a preacher they couldn't get a preaching anyway he walked around and he was waiting for that you know the prophet lived in the vision you know he was waiting for that call and he said when he got to the place I saw this young girl she was finished she was about to die property prayed for her and first thing he asked okay before that he went and he asked those people can we have a meeting in this church and that man that owned that place he said no you can't have a meeting in this church I don't blame him for not allowing them because maybe preachers come there leave the church and go away because it was not feasible to run the church today churches become feasibilities whether it's feasible to run a church or not feasible to run a church so when it's not feasible to run a church you close it down leave the people so that's exactly what is happening people close the church and no more church now people might find their own ways it happened in the message I'm not going to talk about the denomination right there were things like that now yeah I'm telling you if there's two people sitting here if I start to preach for two people amen take them to Heaven amen they're having a thousand people inside yeah yeah and sending 50 of them that's a church no church closes so this man must have been angry in his apartment you know what I've got a lot of these people now they'll come and get all the people and leave them and run away so you never allowed it so they went around they went a little bit they went and seen the place and they said hey you know what the Lord said him to go to a certain house when it's honestly girls I think she had TB or something some sort of a sickness she had cancer and the prophet prayed for her she jumped out of the she never once you were never was out of the bed for months she jumped out of the bed and the neighbors saw it and it was a whole Place went on fire for the Lord then they started to have meetings the man said okay come have meetings and the very same man ended up being the pastor of the church who first disallowed the meetings but then the prophet said and the brothers were asking the prophet what do we do yet I'm giving you this because you need to know because there's so much of things that are going around you need to know what is happening right and you need to know you have to stay in Fellowship amen you need to know that you have to be in Fellowship amen you need to know that you need a church to stay here hallelujah not streaming and all that kind of stuff no the prophet said the brothers we will send somebody every week to have those meetings until we find somebody to pass to the church yes yes sir yeah and somebody to pass to the church now that's what happened and they came week after week week after week week after week and then they saw this brother growing and growing in the best and So eventually eventually he became the pastor so that is why I'm saying there's no two Pastors in one church amen every church is a sovereign church if you've got five churches 10 churches and you're going around you better place pastors there amen Grace pastors there let them run the church amen we've got no overseers we've only got one overseer amen who's the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and here was David is busy he's busy now with his congregations he's got everything ready and the priest was going to anoint him but God had to raise up a nature Nathan Nathan the prophet came and reminded by Sheba Bathsheba with a queen remember what David said it's Solomon thy son will be king and not Energizer you go in see the plan going to raise Mordecai to tell Esther yeah God is rising Nathan to tell the queen to go in David hasn't spoken David hadn't eaten but here he came heading to the queen go in and I will come and confirm amen confirm yes what you said amen praise the Lord Yeshiva goes in the Queens the king speaks the queen had the power to make the king to speak amen the king won't speak until the queen gets this amen this King won't speak until the queen gets there yeah hallelujah amen you can try to make him true you can put any amount of heat you can do what you like only when this queen gets there amen when this queen gets there hallelujah praise the Lord amen and then this was the last day God raised at William Brennan amen amen glory to God amen amen God raised the William Brothers to remind the queen hallelujah amen the
