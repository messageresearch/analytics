10 Hallelujah know we are limited to time 28 minutes 28 February but one day with the Lord thousand years so you have to be careful Revelation 10 verse one very familiar portion of scripture amen and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rain rainbow was upon his head and his face were as with the sun and his feet as pills of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion wrote when he had cried seven Thunders utter their voices amen when the seven Thunders had uted their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven tunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that live forever and ever who created the Heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein and there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared it to his servants the prophets Matthew 11:25 while you're turning to it we be all the pastors that are here this evening amen amen praise the Lord Matthew 11:25 says at that time time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has reveal them unto tonight Lord bless reading of his word you may take your seats while we offer a word of prayer father we thank you once again for the reading of thy precious word we pray God that you would come and Inspire us and Speak Lord God the things that we need to know and understand Lord because the bride must know and recognize her day and her message Lord we bless your hly name of the service unto thee now in Jesus precious name ask much Thanksgiving amen amen amen we're going to just uh speak on the attraction this evening amen and as quick as I can uh go through some uh notes that I put down uh I want to say that the difference between the denominations and the meage church is Revelation chapter 10 Hallelujah that's what makes the difference Revelation 10 is the open book revelation 10 uh 10 makes the uh the opening of the revelation of Seven Seals makes the Bible a brand new book Revelation chapter 10 separates the wheat and the 10 amen and I believe it's the wheat that is gathered around the celebration of one place on Sun Mountain now if there's anything that we must say brothers and sisters we must bring it back to the scripture amen and the Bible is the absolute the Bible like says the Bible is God in print form amen and that's why in Revelation says you cannot add to this Bible you cannot take out from the Bible because it's God in PR form god is perfect this word is perfect amen there's no mistakes in the Bible there's no mistakes in our message either and so we want to just Fellowship a little bit around it tonight but says if there is a scriptural sign Hallelujah then you must identify the scripture for that sign if there is a sign and if it's a scriptural sign then you identify the scripture for that sign amen for example like uh the sign of the cloud if the cloud is a scriptural sign then we must identify which scripture is being fulfilled by the just like Jesus was born to Mary who Mary said I'm a virgin that know no man and those that heard her testimony said no she had an affair with the soldier and all of those things they they couldn't understand that this woman could bring forth a a child hallu being a virgin but then those that would took the time yes those that would have taken the time to said okay if this lady if what she's saying is true yes that she being a virgin has brought for a child let's see if there's a scripture to justify what she saying hallelujah and if they had gone back to the scripture they would have come to Isaiah 7:14 and they would be able to tie up the scripture for the sign so any Scripture sign we must identify the the cloud that we are speaking about that we are rejoicing about is not something new amen it is in the Bible all the way from the Old Testament to the New Testament the children of Israel had the P of Fire by night they had a p of cloud by the day there were so many instances where the cloud appeared throughout the Bible Elijah one time he sent his servant to look towards the sea and uh the Bible say at the seventh watch the seventh time he went and he looked towards the sea he saw a cloud rising up brother the man says over there in the west a cloud was rising up amen Moses built a tabernacle and the cloud overshadowed the Tabernacle the same with the temple the cloud overshadow the temple yes amen the cloud brother man says the cloud is a sign of the condescension of God Amen Hallelujah brother also says in another quote the cloud is a sign of the coming of the Lord yes amen so every time you seen the cloud in the Bible it was showing that Christ of God was coming down amen hallelujah now I want to start by taking a type tonight in the in the a type uh of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments yes and we know the Commandments is the word of God Amen and in other words Moses was receiving the word of God for his day because the word come to the prophets amen and we know Jesus was the word he was the word made flesh and and um Jesus himself when he come on Earth he introduced himself first to the prophet yes John the Baptist so the word always comes to the prophet amen now Moses here his asks of the Lord in the book of Exodus he says I want you to ascend up unto the mountain for the receiving of the word for your day amen hallelujah remember he was going to receive the Ten Commandments yes which for Moses and Israel was the Revelation 10 for them yes and so we read in Exodus 24 from 13 to 16 you can read it at home the Bible says the glory of the Lord was upon that mountain not only that there but the scripture is specific it says the glory of the Lord abod on the mountain for six days that mean for 6 days the cloud was on the mountain and then the Bible says on the seventh day amen then God called out to Moses from the midst of the not from Heaven somewhere not from the earth somewhere not from other parts of the mountain from the midst of the cloud God called out to Moses he says come up into the mountain and come into the cloud on the seventh day yes mean six days in the boat on the mountain but on the seventh day Moses goes into the cloud and what God done is God began to reveal his mind to Moses what was in the back parts of God's mind was revealed to Moses and Moses come down and began to express those things those hidden mysteries which was his Revelation 10 in time yes amen you love the Lord the Tabernacle the feast and all of those things all was revealed to Moses that was their message for the day yes amen you love the Lord amen now you notice like I said Moses went up on the mountain on the seventh day the cloud hung over there for a just keep keep note of my words the the Cloud hung on the mountain for about a week yes yes absolutely so for about a week the cloud hung on that mountain our Prophet messenger you know is caught up in the cloud and he's caught up in the cloud on Sunset Mountain yes notice it's a seven Church age it's also a type of the seventh day and this Prophet is caught up into the cloud the glory of the Lord shined upon Moses when he went into that cloud yes amen and brother man says it's a special adoption robe amen and the special adoption robe what it identifies is that this is my beloved Son he him me the word of the Lord is in this Propet to give out to the people yes so Moses the clouds on the mountain six days he goes up on the seven days cut up into the cloud Moses is shining with the glory of the Lord Moses has a special adoption robe he has the word in him to give out to the people Amen Hallelujah Jesus Christ had the same experience amen he had a special adoption rope the prophet says Mount Transfiguration you can read the book of Matthew it gives an account and Matthew says after six days yes means that Jesus is gone onto Transfiguration on the seventh day Hallelujah notice here that Jesus Took Peter James and John oh yes up unto the mountain Moses also took Witnesses yes and Peter James and John up into the mountain he was transfigured before them they were caught up into that cloud and the face of Jesus and his rign was shining with the glory of the Lord so exact same thing on the seventh day into the cloud the glory of the Lord is shining Upon Jesus a special adoption roote this is my beloved Son he he him hallelujah amen love the Lord praise the Lord God's word was in Moses mes to give to the people God's word was in Christ to give to the people yeah he him amen praise the Lord when you read Matthew's account Matthew says after 6 days yes Jesus went onto Transfiguration means on the seventh day when you read the book of Mark The Book of Mark says after six days means on the seventh day Jesus goes into the cloud on the mountain yes Moses in the cloud on the mountain on the seventh day also and in know their face was shining like the sun yes but when you read the account in the Book of Luke Luke says about 8 days so one Moses was seven Matthew says seven and uh Mark says seven but Luke says eight days and Luke says the exact same things that the other have said only the day changes yes from 7 to 8 and you think that oh is a contradiction in the Bible but no contradiction amen you cannot add you cannot take out why because it's a perfect book Hallelujah why it's God in print form if it's a contradiction then there's an error with God God's not perfect yeah amen we'll see just now Lord give us Grace so the reignment his reignment was shining and his face was shining the glory of the Lord was upon Christ as he entered into the mountain now look at Elijah on Mount K the prophet the Bible says a fire came down and consumed the sacrifice a tub of calvary and straight up there Elijah prophesies rain but the rain does not come at the exact same time yes and then Elijah sends says to his servant go and look into the sea and see if you can if you can find a sign of rain amen what was Elijah looking for a cloud because the cloud must bring rain every time the cloud appears it must come with rain amen we have a cloud that has come say the cloud that has come is bring a latter rain not only L rain but a f in a latter rain has come with this Cloud yes so yeah the servant goes out and he's looking for a sign of rain he does not see a cloud yes he goes the first time the second time the third six but the Bible says on the seventh time in the seventh watch he goes and looked into the sea and he says he saw a cloud rising up in the says in the west you love the Lord amen let me read you a quick quote there speak to the Rock and it shall give forth its water he said how foolish they carel Minds well if that's the best you can give me just let it alone like Elijah one day when he went to pray and he sent his servant up to see if there was any sign of a cloud and he went the seventh time and when he come back he said oh yes there's a little Cloud about the size of a man's hand hand over in the west over there now this is a prophet of God yes he's not mixing his words he knows exactly what he's pointing to amen a cloud in the west over there amen love the Lord amen so now you look at you look at a prophet now our Prophet William branam he had also had a mount SII experience he had a mount Transfiguration experience and if you read sir is this a Time the prophet relates a vision that he had in December 22 1962 amen about a pyramid a blast going out going off in the west and so forth we familiar with these things he told his wife that it's time for him to die he says because no man can survive the blast yes Junior Jackson had a dream about the pyramid the C opening light never Shone under me before and the prophet said I'll have to go rest and come back and bring the interpretation amen so all of these dreams are unfolding and there was about eight dreams related to sunset Mountain sunset Mountain was not just an experience but sunset Mountain was prophesied eight or more dreams before it actually happened Hallelujah and so um I think it was Leo Mercy that dreamed about brother bam being packed into a cloud and taken over into the West yeah even the cloud was in the in the dream now we know God called his Prophet up into sunset Mountain yes Mount sunset set Sunset is where the Sun is setting because it's an evening time message in the evening time there shall be light Hallelujah and B says there was a light in that cloud yes amen yes sir Hallelujah the cloud on on this mountain in the seven Church age brother bam I'm I'm not going to go too much in detail but I'm just going to say what the tape says brother says what is the attraction on the mountain yes what is the noise all about amen he says it is the Fulfillment of Revelation 10 verse 1-7 now do not say that Revelation 10 verse 1-7 is going to be fulfilled yes he do not put it in the future tense he did not put it in the past tense but he says what is this attraction what is happening right now on Sunset mountain is now being fulfilled Revelation 10 verse 1 to7 amen praise the Lord amen what is your attraction the mountain PR 146 Propet says now if if it's a scripture sign you must find a scripture that's the scripture brother gave us for the scripture sign yes Junior Jackson listening and you remember the dream that I uh that he had that I interpreted going toward setting of the Sun and this happened on Sunset Mountain it's the evening time sunset time the sunset message through a setting of History a setting of Prophecy rather being fulfilled and it shall be light at the evening time upon sunset Mountain in the cor not Forest 40 mil God of Tucson he says get on the map and see if Sunset Peak is there that's exactly where it happened I never know it till the other day everything see that shall never die is see it's constantly unrolling itself from the very thing happening to the picture being Jesus standing looking at us amen and now exactly on sunset Mountain and the sunset light the evening light has come amen that God and Christ the one the white how many seen it the white wig upon him as we talk in Revelation 1 see the Supreme deity supreme authority no other voice no other God no other nothing in him dwells the fullness of the god and body the Angels themselves was his weak amen praise the Lord so he makes it clear who this person was that on Mount s he makes it clear what this Cloud was it's the same one in Revelation chapter one supreme D supreme god the very Supreme one the Angels themselves was his way PR 148 he says what happened upon Mount Sunset God confirming his word am what word that's what all the noise is about it's God fulfilling his promised word again the prophecy yes what prophecy Hallelujah Revelation 10 1 to7 and in the days of the sounding of the Seven Angels message the mystery of God should be finished amen the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1-7 the last Messenger to the last age fills exactly in this age St Luke 17 that is the day when the son of man is being revealed Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah brother man's not missing his words amen he don't even have to be educated understand this quotation it's just glaring at you amen amen now the supernatural Cloud appeared on Mount sunset on the 28th of February 1963 yes the picture was taken and it proved to be Supernatural and of course there are those who say that it was caused by rocket smoke to disprove the message yes amen now there was a report done by Dr James McDonald yeah James McDonald is an expert expert in cloud formation and atmosphere yes amen and uh after he had studied the picture and uh he had done his own uh research James McDonald came back and said that was not rocket smoke amen absolutely brother bam didn't even know that the cloud actually appeared on the 28th of February yeah SS took the picture yes brother man even says he says they took the picture not us but that picture Pro our message if Bram took the picture then we can say we manufactured the picture but the problem says they took the picture but the picture Prov our message and so their own scientist their own cloud expert James McDonald said that was not rocket sloke yes and he said there was no water vapor at that height to form a natural Cloud yes he said it had to be Supernatural amen hallelujah they said it they said it amen if it was a rocket smoke how did it form a cloud horizontal yes do we have the picture brother amen a rocket flies vertical yeah this picture is formed horizontal so that that rocket had a malfunction it has to fly horizontal across the landscape but rockets fly straight up but this cloud is formed if you see how it's formed it's formed the horizontal yeah so this picture is in the horizontal if it was a rocket smoke then the rocket smoke must produce this picture the other way but it was produced in a horizontal just because God knew that they were going to point it to Rocket smoke amen and then the Lord said to the prophet now turn the picture then we have that picture hanging on our wall that was not in a vertical position yes but was far was form in a horizontal and God said turn it amen because if God put it like that then they'll say it was rocket St that done that Hallelujah you love the Lord amen amen praise the Lord so the Lord said to Prophet turn the picture the picture was taken in flag stop some 4 hours away driving distance from California if it was rocket smoke how did it keep its shape all the way for 4 hours yes amen clouds cannot do that amen keep a form for 4 hours Journey yes James McDonald also added this into his notes and uh you can tell me why he says there was iridescent in the cloud if you know what iridescent is it's the colors of the rainbow Hallelujah they took the picture they said there was a rainbow in the cloud but it proved our scripture and it proves our message hallah oh yes roet smoke does not put a rainbow in a cloud amen you love the Lord James mcdonal said there was iridescent in the cloud means that the colors of the rainbow was in amen This Cloud thank you Lord according to our Prophet whose word we take it was the Fulfillment of Revelation 10 verse 1-7 the coming down of a mighty Angel and John said I saw another Mighty angel coming down from heaven go with a cloud and a rainbow upon his [Applause] head thank you Dr James McDonald amen the rainbow in the clown says the Covenant Angel and who else can it be but Christ himself rainbow God G made a covenant with Noah and what was the Covenant with Noah I put a bow bow in the rainbow I put a bow in the cloud I put a rainbow in the cloud if you read Genesis Genesis 8 verse 5 it says after the rain was over and finished the waters began to decrease upon the Earth it says and the Caps of the mountain became visible on the 10th day of the first month amen not a coincidence praise the Lord that when the Caps of the mountain are visible the capstones of the mountain are visible on the 10th day of the first month Revelation chap 101 the Capstone is visible in Genesis 8 verse5 yes you love the Lord amen because we had a Capstone that come down Revelation 101 God commands uh Genesis 8:14 the Bible says that the Lord said to uh Noah on which was the Bible say the 27th day of the second month yes yeah on the 10th day of the first month the Caps are being shown yes then in Genesis 8:14 the Lord says to Noah on the 27th day of the second man he says to Noah the Earth is dry the land is dry empty out the AR and offer a sacrifice unto the Lord on the 27 day of the second month yes amen I don't know how long it took him to empty the ark and offer a sacrifice but you you see the chapter changes chapter n the Lord says to Noah and his family be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth the only thing we know is the 27 of the 2 God says empty the ark offer sacrifice and the next thing the Bible is telling us the Lord is saying to Noah be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth in other words between the 27th of the second month to the start of chapter n the Lord is saying to Noah I want you to go and bring forth life upon the Earth in other words it's a time of life when after the 27 of the second month now you can read between the lines we are message believers they come to Abraham and Sarah and he said that Sarah will have a child amen and I will visit you according to the time of life and says what is the time of life every 28 days a woman goes to a cycle and that is a time of lifej so if it was the 2 27th of the second month and he emptied the AR and in chapter N9 he says go be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth I am saying it was the 28th of the second mon it was the time of life for Noah that come back on Earth amen you love the Lord yes let me just skip here quickly praise the Lord so on the 28 of the second month which is Genesis 9 it is a time of life for Noah and we are saying it's a Trin of the second month and the Lord in this chapter is saying now Noah I'm going to establish my Covenant with you I'm going to put a cloud with a bow inside of it Hallelujah yeah amen it says a bow in a cloud yes it's both singular Yes means one cloud with one bow in the cloud read the scripture you'll see brother and sisters amen time of life amen 28th of the 2 month God's making a covenant because it's a covenant Angel it's the same one that came today at the same time 28th of February 28 of the 2 month yes you love the Lord science took the picture up it Yeah in our day brother says they took the picture not us says it is our Lord up there the rising of the Sun the quote is there points to the picture he says it is our Lord up then hallelujah it hung there for 28 minutes almost half an hour amen it's I mean f Revelation chapter 8 but I'm going to skip but here's the thing that I want to bring out tonight quickly the thing that causes doubt for so many and they say brother mam is a false prophet and they they tell us that the cloud um that was formed there oh they tell us that the the the cloud they speak about the cloud being formed and the rockets SW all of those things but the prophet made it clear that those were the wings of seven angels amen hallelujah there was no Cloud that produced that but the wings of seven angels amen and a prophet told us that he was caught up into the cloud of this Angels many of them left the message because they said brother manam was not there on the 28 of February yes you love the Lord am yes sir now you know brother Ram was actually not there on the 28 of February yes and um the prophet was meant to go javalina hunting javalina javalina Park and uh but the season only started on the 1st of March yes and so the 28 of Fe when the cloud appeared but the manam could not be on the mountain yes because if he went there he would have broke hunting laws yes and the prophet's daughter Rebecca said she said that Daddy did not break any hunting rules he obeyed all the rules means that Daddy the prophet William Bam could not be on the mountain on the 28th of February because hunting season started on the 1st of March yes for those that hear the prophet speak about him being caught up into this constellation of angels they say okay if the prophet was caught up then he should have been there on the 28th but according to what we know he was not there on the 28th and then they say okay he's a false prophet a brother Bam's own account brother B remember brother bham tells us about his experience with seven angels amen that's what he is according to us in his own account brother man tells us that he was not there on the 28th of February and uh he tells and he gives us the reason why he could not have been there amen now the problem himself was meant to go hunting on the 1 of March but he receives a call from a certain mother and saying that her son was going to be executed by electric chair and that she needed him to come and offer his assistance speak to the judge speak to somebody the son might live and brother says he loved hunting so much but he could not allow himself to turn down a mother that was crying for a son amen and so the prophet said he made his way to Hon Texas now what God is actually doing he's taking his servant further and father away from this Cloud that appeared on 28th of February yes yes amen but it's a purpose yes God doesn't do anything just for nothing and the prophets are led by God and so brother Adam was not there on the 20th of February he was nowhere near the cloud on the 28th of February when those angels appeared brother baram did not even know the Angels appeared and the picture was taken on 28th February until he read the article in the paper then he got to know there was a May edition then he got to know that there was a picture taken of the cloud on Mount Sunset amen you love the Lord amen praise the Lord so God is taking his Prophet away from the event but the BAM his own testimony is telling us that he was not there now according to my own understanding I'm going to show the unfolding of this in here in the book called A absolute a absolute and the other day when I had some arrangements said and the other day when I had arrangements made for something else there was hunting yes uh another place and I knew that those children were facing death yeah I thought if something would happen to those children I would never forgive myself of not coming here to give my opinion and doing all that I could to help this mother and father and his children and to do all that I could for the saving of their lives yes that's 63034 the 4th of March this is amen he says he had there something he wanted to do yes the other day but he couldn't go and do it because of the mother and his children so he went away parag 117 and my faith that I have in God and that's why I'm here tonight fourth of March that's why I can out something else and we got in yeah what did he cancel out his hunting trip he's in Houston on the 4th of March preaching an evening service and it takes from our calculation plus minus 20 hours of driving from Houston to California mean that he would have left uh on the fth to flag stop and when hunting on the 6th of March is my opinion means preaching on the fall on the 5th of March he's driving 20 hours back and on the 6th of March in the morning the prophet goes hunting for javalina and if he went hunting for javalina on the sixth means that on the seventh of March brother bam would have had the cloud the angel experience amen hallelujah take a deep breath brother and sisters the cloud appeared on Mount saai and hung there for how many days six days six days the Bible says and the seven days Moses was called up into the CL yeah the prophet the the Angels appear on the mountain brother bam is gone to Houston but brother is coming back to the mountain he's coming back for hunting in my opinion on the seventh day brother bam goes and has an experience with this Angels amen hallelujah perseverance 63802 paragraph 15 he said how many ever how many ever heard the tape sir what time is it just before I went out west the reason the angel of the Lord sent me out there he told me now coming from the heavens will be seven angels in a consolation yes there will be three on the one side and one on the top it'll be like a triangle or something like a pyramid I said the one on the right had his wings turned back and I swept right into the consolation by him and he was to tell me what to do Hallelujah and I went Westward just as he told me was up there on the very same day and when they started coming from Heaven I said there will be a sound of a great blast something like a break of an airplane a sound breaker going for it'll be so much louder than that and it'll be just be Northeast of TUC Tucson about 50 or 100 miles something like that and tuon will be setting this way and I'll be picking some kind of cockers or goat heads they call them call them there off my trous trouser legs and I said a blast will go off and we were up there at that day and I was over to myself there is a man I think brother Suman is here tonight was with me and brother Norman are you here brother Fred I thought I heard you

Brother Norman to come the other way and brother Fred in the middle and to go this way and then they hit the mountain run away I would just fire up he said I would just fire up in the air to get to get them to run back the other way and so you just you just follow brother so you can go back and read it and and we got out there and there was no javalina I glassed with a friend about a mile away I could see him he went back upon the mountain where there was no javalina I went down the mountain to a great Chasm come up and I sat down it was about 8:00 at morning yes on the seventh right and I had I had folded my legs and was off my overalls was picking some of them goes and I said you know I look at there isn't that strange I said he said exactly I'm perfectly in position yes north east of Tucson and FL see and I be east of flag up north east of Tucson I said yes is goed that I said I'm picking off my trousers I said that's strange and I just throw it down like that and I looked up and on the side across the Great Chasm and there was a whole H up there it was almost a shooting distance so I wouldn't shoot them myself cuz I didn't want them you see because he got his already yes if I can get them to be the fed and uh and run them down over over that way is just speaking there and it scared okay and as I was running along all of a sudden it sound like the whole country come apart and such a blast and it scared me till I thought I was wearing a black hat big black hat and and that just looked like a javelin anyhow and I thought somehow somebody must have shot me and it just scared me till I jumped into the air and then I thought what is all this about on the seventh yes see I see the rocks tumbling off side of the Hill rolling down and I looked and there was the white circle above me there amen hallelujah circling around yet come seven angels coming down out of the a picked me up and said go back to your home to the east right away bring those Seven Seals for the seven mysteries for the complete word is been revealed now in those seven Mysteries now brother himself is saying that it was in the month of March in my opinion on the 7th of March that he had had this experience not on the 28th of February he only found out about the picture in the May edition you love the Lord amen amen it has to be perfect praise the Lord because Moses went on the seventh day yes Jesus went on seven days amen so brother B if he's a scriptural Prophet must go under seven days hallelujah he cannot go under 28 days he can't go on the first day on the second day he must go on the seventh day paragraph 26 he says if you never heard it if you ever believe ever that I ever said ending in a sermon inspired you take them tapes of the Seven Seals I'm not a tape salesman Mr Salman sells tapes him and Mr Maguire but I don't sell tapes they take them and if you ever anything that's real as I can say it's thus sayth the Lord get those and you know not in that time talking about the 28 of February I didn't know it but cameras from all over the country was taking a picture of that yes he is it there yes you see he said I didn't know it because he had his experience in March this was 28th of February he said but cameras all over was taking a picture of that that white cloud settled down West went on the associate press I think your Chicago paper packed all around Light magazine packed how many seen seen in there and um let's just go it went beyond uh it's the HED country you see there was no airplanes no nothing in there it was too high 26 miles high there was no Vapor or nothing you couldn't they couldn't make Vapor anyhow 30 mil across it yes said they couldn't make no Vapor nothing because it was Angels the Lord it was not SM it was not Cloud brother Jee Norman on giving an interview on the on the event at sunset Mountain he says the prophet had told him I think this this actually is on the is on Google you can check it out in fact there's another one also uh brother g n giving the account of the um uh event on Sunset he says the prophet had told him that the angels have been waiting for him for all week amen that's Brother G Norman Prophet told him the Angels had waited for him all week yes means about a week yes waited six seven days they waited for him why to fulfill scripture the book of Exodus when the Bible says the the cloud appeared on the mountain and on the mountain for 6 days and on the seventh day waiting for him Moses goes into the cloud yeah the the Gom and says brother says that the Angels waited about a week yes you love the Lord amen in the breach that's round it up in the bridge between seven Church 8 the seven sees he said how many of you has read what time is it serves and heard it he says that bothered me quite a bit if you haven't I wish some of you would get to Y he says I just wanted to drop this standing uh starting the service he says about a week and then he corrects himself 10 days ago he's preaching the breach on the 17th yes is that right yes he's preaching the breach on the 17th he's talking about something that happened 10 days ago yes what date will that be yes amen praise the Lord I think we do match means it on the seventh 10 days ago means that on the seventh something happened amen you love the Lord say I was Disturbed I just I I wouldn't take service or anything because I don't know it seemed like it could have been something that was bad I didn't know what it was you see B keeps relating and he's speaking about the the sorden hand and he's speaking about sunset Mountain but he's very specific he says about a week and then he corrects himself 10 days ago means on the 7th of March yes something happened Prophet was caught up in a cloud of seven angels Prophet speaks about his encounter with the cloud and seven angels 10 days ago something happened means on the 7th of March brother bam was on that mountain let just skip here now remember Moses the seventh day Matthew said s day Mark said seven day brother bam is on the seventh day but Luke said was the eighth day amen you love the Lord yes amen can you put up that that numbers Brothers I just want to show something everybody can tell the story their own way yes you see after six days in March is which day if you could help me seven the seven day so in other words for Moses six days the cloud is in the the the clouds on the mountain on the seventh day Moses goes up Matthew says after 6 days so if you say after six days of March means that he went on the seventh day yes and then Mark said after six days after six days of March means he went on the seventh day but Luke says on the eth day yes but depends where you're counting from amen if you're counting from the 28 or February sunset Mountain then the seventh day becomes your eth day amen hallelujah so those that are saying after 6 days means what they're saying is after six days in March on the seventh day he was taken into a cloud but those that are looking back to Sunset Mountain they're saying on the eth day amen hallelujah is taken into whether it's the eth day or whether it's the seven after six days it's actually the same day same day they all are accounting for that this Prophet went up into Hallelujah the mountain you love the Lord let me leave you there there's lot to say but we want to listen toen prise the Lord hallelujah amen
