hallelujah what a precious promise we have amen that where the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered amen hallelujah praise the Lord so amen let's turn to our Bibles amen maybe a little thought Hallelujah just to encourage us that God still has anointed David's amen amen God still has anointed Davids in this hour Hallelujah ujah praise the Lord yes amen you believe that amen amen let's turn to acts 13 and verse 22 read from there amen praise the Lord so the scripture is going to talk about how God removed Saul so he says and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their King Amen to whom also he gave testimony and said now this is God giving testimony the same God that gave testimony over Enoch that he had a testimony that he pleased God I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own art who shall fulfill all my will amen that's St John 5 19 now the son can do nothing but what he seeth the father do that doth the son likewise that's the place of rest that's the the hidden place we're talking about now right remember we to be a man after God's Own Heart means you must be after his likeness amen so we're dealing with after his likeness these thoughts are coming out of here amen praise the Lord then we can go to Hallelujah praise the Lord just want to find my verse here 2 Corinthians 10:4 [Applause] from verse three though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds amen this is a powerful church amen the army of Jesus Christ is a powerful church because though it looks like we're walking in the flesh we are not Waring after the flesh we are pulling down strongholds amen hallelujah casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen so when your thoughts are going all over you're catching it and you're bringing it in obedience amen you're bringing your thoughts captive praise the Lord to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your dis when your obedience is fulfilled Hallelujah do you look on things after the outward appearance so the same thing they did to David now they looked at the outp appearance right if any man trust to himself that he is Christ let him of let him of himself think this again that that as he is Christ even so are we Christ for though I should boast somewhat more of our Authority which the Lord had given us for edification and not for your destruction I should not be ashamed amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise the Lord amen just want to read one more portion of scripture here Genesis 1: 126 says God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth why I'm reading that now is because you'll see now why I'm reading that man was given dominion over all of these things so these things can't have dominion over man Hallelujah so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them all right amen so man was given dominion over these things hallelujah praise the Lord so we'll go to 1 Samuel and just for a point of reference we'll pick up the story line praise the [Music] lord we can go to First Samuel 16 and you can reference as we go along from verse 10 there we find here that Saul was raised up as king over Israel now we know there's a natural Israel and there's a spiritual Israel amen so we're not speaking a story line just based Amen to get excited over something we are looking at spiritual Israel how God raised an anointed king called Saul but because of his Disobedience God told him and if you watch the of of Saul he really wanted to repent but he could find no place of repentance God refused and the Bible says that he repented that he he made Saul King because he refused to kill this King and all of the subjects and all of the cattle God had said kill everything so we can't bring anything from the world into spiritual Israel amen God says kill it all praise the Lord amen so from verse 10 here now that God is coming to look for a new king amen God is coming to look for a new king and I'm saying that God still has anointed David's amen now remember David was not one of the popular people he was on the back side of the desert watching over his father sheep so he's not one of prominence he was not one amen of great people didn't respect him well he was just an ordinary Shepherd but here in verse 10 you'll find again Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord had not chosen these so seven Church ages has passed by but the Lord had not chosen these to be an end time people to be here to finish the thing thing is a mystery amen hallelujah amen amen so if seven sons pass by who is David oh yes what number is he but eight is going back to the to the beginning the eighth day is going back to the first day you know brother Brandon teaches us these things so if this man is the E he's going to be back in the image again amen he's going to be able to have dominion over the Beast of the field amen hallelujah he's going to have dominion over lions and he's going to have dominion over bears oh yes Hallelujah you see what I'm talking about now if he's the eight he must be like one in the beginning and he must have dominion amen even though they are wild animals now he still has dominion over them and if you notice the Bible doesn't describe David as being a strong and a mighty warrior the Bible calls him of readyy readyy countenance amen amen hallelujah so let's continue to read the Lord had chosen none of these and Samuel said unto Jesse I hear all thy children and he said they remain it yet the youngest amen and behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come either I'm telling you that all creation is groaning as well yes and they are saying we will not stop our groan until they come amen we are looking for the manifestation of the sons of God yes amen and they will not keep quiet yeah amen you can keep the church World quiet you can keep people quiet from their prayers but one thing all creation will not stop groaning they groan daily amen they are groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God am praise the Lord amen so he says we will not sit down till he come either and he sent and brought him now he was ready with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he amen so the same way God has chosen us specifically said this is him amen this is her amen this is the one I can use oh yes Hallelujah now notice God is working on both ends God always works on both ends there's a king that's being rejected and God wants to replace him so can I say that there's an anointed one that's being rejected and God's going to replace him with another anointed one praise the Lord then Samuel took the on of oil and we know the oil typing the Holy Spirit and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to Rama but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul amen and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him and Saul's servant said unto him behold now an evil spirit from God troubleth thee let our Lord Now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man now how do they know that m music can drive out demon [Music] powers let's seek a man who is a cunning player of on an up and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from God is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well you see because the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they know that Earth is influenced by spiritual for forces amen and we have got to realize that as well in our lives things are just not ordinary in the natural amen like we think sometimes there's always a spirit attached to it it's either the spirit of God or it's a spirit an evil spirit yes can you see it here in the scripture amen amen it might look from the ordinary that Saul was being vexed in his spirit and now he was troubled because the kingdom was going to be taken away from him that you'll think he's going into depression but here the Bible is revealing that it's a spirit that vexed him amen so here David is a man now remember you don't have to operate as a son only because somebody gave you a title I'll break it down further David was already operating as a priest amen because a priest as our Prophet teaches us he's one who gives praise to the Lord amen the fruits of your lips giving praise to God Amen so I I'm about to show you the image now here's a man who is giving praise to God meaning he's fulfilling the role of a priest and he is going to be the anointed king so he is both priest and King which is the image of God amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen so when somebody is in the image of God nothing shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life I am challenging you this evening and bringing this message to tell you that you are being molded and shaped into the image of Jesus Christ amen you are both priest and King but you have to come into your Authority now nothing shall be able to stand before you amen amen am Hallelujah so there he says provide me a man that when the evil spirit from God is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well and Saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me then answered one of his servants and said behold I've seen a son of Jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning and playing might Mighty Valiant man and a man of war but David was tending sheep he was not in Battle Before amen but they call him a man of war we're making wars in the heavenlies Hallelujah I put it to you this way brother Joshua that this was not the first time David played and Demon Spirits fled that's why they called him they had seen the power of His playing that when this man played music demon powers left bodies amen you see how important the music is amen amen that's why there's a half an hour music before the service therefore the singers and the musicians have to be anointed that when they are playing amen and before they come to service there ought to be a preparation there ought to be a prayer Lord even as I play today I pray that demon spirits will leave amen l if anyone's coming there downhearted depressed I pray the spirit of God Amen the music will flow and the spirit of God will bring Deliverance to them even before the preacher comes yes Hallelujah so he's a mighty Valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the Lord is with him Hallelujah wherefore Saul sent Messengers unto Jesse say send me David thy son which is with the sheep and Jesse took an ass Laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by David his son unto Saul you see when you read in the Bible there you'll see even when they were going to Salt uh sorry to Samuel they always took something to give the man of God because they recognize the anointing Upon A man I'm just trying to show you why they were doing this yeah amen they didn't just go empty-handed when Saul goes to Samuel the first time to speak to him he also he's troubled and he ask his the man that's next to him but we have nothing to give the man of God and then the man of God says I have some silver here we can give him this amen am hallelujah amen so he's saying here we're going now to Saul so he's also giving him wine and a kid and he sent him unto Saul and David came came to Saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armor Bearer and Saul said to Jesse let David I pray thee stand before me for he had found favor in my sight and it came to pass when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul that David took an up and played with his hand so Saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him amen amen if you don't have a musician to play for you live put on some good gospel music amen hallelujah praise the Lord or maybe I don't know if these brothers are willing maybe you call them and say brother I'm troubled in my spirit why don't you bring your instrument and come play music for me amen praise the Lord so then that brings us now to chapter 17 an anointed there's a man who's anointed for the position of King amen but God is also showing you that this man is not operating in the spir in the natural realm this man is operating in the king Kingdom realm in the spiritual realm he understands about spiritual warfare therefore we read there the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal so we find ourselves that there's a king now who is losing his position and his authority within his kingdom and the fullest time armies are coming against him because Satan can only work through doubt and reasoning amen Satan can only work when there's doubt and reasoning and now we find if you can put it this way that the guide that left Saul and when the guide leaves Saul when the guide leaves that brings room for the enemy to come in amen when the guide left in the Garden of Eden Adam left and he went to work what happened the enemy came in Hallelujah and Saul said uh this is verse two now and Saul and the men of Israel gathered together and pitched by the valley of ela and set the battle in Array against the Philistines and the Philistines stood on a mountain on one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them I wonder if this is why David wrote in the psalm though I walk to the [Music] valley amen hallelujah of the shadow of death I will fear no evil amen amen praise the Lord yes because it was in the valley is where the battle was yes gol was waiting there Hallelujah and they went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath whose I was six cubits and a span you see these people like slangs hey for those of you who caught it amen his height was six cubits and a span and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he's armed with a coat of maale and the weight of his coat was 5,000 shekels of brass and he had Greaves of brass upon his legs and BR a target of brass between his shoulders if this man only knew that brass represented [Music] judgment amen praise the Lord and he so he had it upon his legs between his shoulders amen but I want you to why I'm reading that I want you to know David wasn't equipped this way yes David had the elet of salvation he had the breastplate of righteousness his loins was GED with truth his feet were short with the preparation of the gospel and he had the sword of the spirit but these were not weapons that you could see with your natural eye because the breastplate of righteousness is not a natural thing that you can see with your eye neither is the armor of salvation but every believer is equipped with a armor amen praise the Lord verse eight and he stood and cried now watch let's just read this verse and he stood and Cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in Array am not I a Philistine and he servants to Saul choose he a man for you and let him come down to me if he be able to fight with me and to kill me that we will be your servants but if I Prevail against him and kill him then shall he be our servants and serve us these were the people that God brought out of Egypt these were God's people to take them captive Satan okay do you know that Satan is now in this Army that these people are demon possessed you know how the Bible decs that Satan was in that King amen the king of T was it the king of T praise the Lord how many if you know what I'm talking about that Satan can become incarnate in people amen and demon powers can possess an army praise the Lord so I'm trying to show you that these are Supernatural forces coming now upon the Earth amen but we are not fighting against flesh and blood you've got to recognize the spirit behind it right amen praise the Lord if he be able to F so we read that verse 10 and the Philistines said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together when Saul and all of Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid now here's the scene in the Israel Camp he has a scene they are standing on the mountain they're looking down on the valley at Goliath screaming at them now the Bible also records in priet chapters that the man that's supposed to Face Goliath was Saul because the Bible records Saul as being Head and Shoulders above all the children of Israel but the Bible says when Saul and Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid so when they fear there there's no faith now I want you watch how God changes a scene because God works on both ends amen what did what did Goliath just make a call for give me a man and when Israel can't provide a man God is going to provide a man amen yes amen hallelujah yes when all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God and the church world can produce the manifested sons of God God is going to provide the man amen yes yes Hallelujah church are you ready to be called amen are you ready for battle amen God has called you for this time and season amen praise the Lord amen now from verse 12 he takes you now to Bethlehem Juda because God wants to rec wants you to remember that the lon is coming from Judah yes amen he's coming from the tribe of Judah the scepter shall not depart from Judah amen so verse 12 changes the scene because God is working on both ends here they are on the battlefield and these people are civilian life maybe thousands of miles away but God is going to answer on both ends yes Hallelujah so Jessi yeah the Bible confirms whose name was Jesse and he had eight Sons so we know the eighth son who he is and we told you the son must go back to the beginning amen and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul amen so I don't want to read all of that amen you can go read it for yourself so I want you want to read this verse 17 and Jesse said unto David his son take now for thy Brethren and EPA of this parched corn and these 10 Loaves and run to the camp to thy brethren and carry these 10 cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look how thy Brethren fare and take their pledge hallelujah praise the Lord now if you read there that's to do with eating right how many of you can see that's to do with eating he's giving them things to eat yeah so you can see 10 10 there Hallelujah and if you go and you if you can put it up quickly Revelation 10:10 it has to do with eating amen praise the Lorden Revelation 10:10 has to do with eating because now he doesn't just listen to the angel but he physically goes and he consumes what's being given to him amen praise the Lord that's just a type there amen praise the Lord let's just move on very quickly so 22 is now God working in an unusual way God coming in an unexpected hour yes yes Hallelujah I present to you the spirit of Truth entering the camp of David yes do you not the Bible when he says when he the spirit of truth comes hallelujah amen amen amen yes when he the spirit of truth comes yes he shall teach you he shall lead you yes amen because the Holy Ghost must work through a man amen praise the Lord amen so we saw the Spirit of Truth operating through brother brandham oh hallelujah amen because when he the spirit of Truth came in this time amen hallelujah he took away all doubt and reasoning Hallelujah God had raised up a man who could stand against the enemy amen so yeah he comes and I like him amen he's not he's got some life about him amen he's got a man amen who's not just half dead the Bible says he left the carriage in the hand of his Keeper of the carriage and ran to the Army and came and saluted his Brethren amen what did the Bible just say these men were fearful and these men were afraid but yes the joy of the Lord coming into the camp he has a spirit of Truth coming into the camp he's got the joy of the Lord in his heart amen though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil amen amen praise the Lord amen and as he talked with them behold they came up the champion Philistine of gath golide by name out of the armies of philistine and spake according to to the same words and David heard them now watch they don't know that God brought David into the battle yes amen hallelujah at the fourth H Rider when all of his armies have come on the earth God has raised up a David in this hour amen when he thinks he's got the message church just look warm cold formal yes Hallelujah God has sent Davids into the camp God has sent David into the camp I said God has sent Davids into the camp yes amen hallelujah they are not coming there to share in the fear but they are bringing a word they are bringing faith into the camp amen they are bringing life back into the camp amen yes Lord David starts to hear this man speak again and all the men of Israel when they saw the man fled from him now I want you to picture that the Bible what it saying when all the men heard Goliath speaking all the men fled from him but I tell you there was one man who didn't flee and the men of Israel said have you seen this man that is come up have you seen this SW Rider yes surely to divy defy Israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who kth him the king will enrich him with great riches and give him his daughter and make his father's house free of in Israel now David can't believe what he's hearing he's saying I can't believe it's so easy because watch how he he expresses it next and David spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that kth the Philistine and take away the approach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that should defy Now watch how many armies can you see but David is true hallelujah amen amen amies yes of the Living God Amen there's a natural Army fearful but there's a Heavenly Host there amen amen praise the Lord and David spake amen so and the people answered he him after this man is saying okay so we know what what he's going to say there right he's going to kill him and then he give him his daughter so here the brothers scold him and in 29 David says what have I done now what have I now done is there no cause is there not a cause amen don't feel brothers sisters don't feel troubled when you are stirring things up amen amen they might tell you quite down it's okay is there not a cause for us to be stirred up in our souls amen amen I'd like to present to you this as well that this is the Gates of Hell the gates of hell and the Gates of Heaven are facing each other here praise the Lord you know last week we spoke on the Gates of Heaven vers the Gates of Hell amen praise the Lord and he turned from him to another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner amen hallelujah and and 33 and Saul said to David thou are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou but a youth and he a man of war from his [Music] Youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and they came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth what would we have done now I want you to know this is a real situation a lion got the sheep in its mouth we would say he's already put him leaving hey hallelujah amen Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and Jesus said not one of them is lost all the father had given me will come to me I don't care if Satan got you in his mouth you are going to be delivered amen amen I don't care if his teeth is biting against you I don't care if he's grinding against you if you are a sheep of God you shall not be lost amen thank you Lord hallelujah there's coming at David to rescue you in fact David is here right now David is here to bring Deliverance to you to open the jaws of the lion and to rescue you yes amen praise the Lord and when he arose against me so watch this lion came for him when he arose against me David wasn't thinking David wasn't I'm trying to show you the picture now David wasn't seeing now hey this guy is trying to eat the L let me go behind him and hit him on his head no he says the lion came for me when he arose against me though an host may come against me I shall not fear the war shall rise praise the Lord amen what does he say here I caught him by his beard and smot him and slew him praise the Lord what am i showing you beast of the field thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear now he's also talking about a bear Hallelujah and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them amen I like a man of vision I like a man who speaks something before it even happens yes amen hallelujah hallelujah how many of you know you can speak to these demon powers yes yes and tell him I bind you in the name of Jesus you're coming against me with all kinds of things I bind you and I cast you out amen amen praise the Lord you shall be as one of them seeing he has defiled the armies of the Living God David said moreover the Lord had delivered me out of the pow of the lion and out of the Paw of the bed he will deliver me out of the hand of the Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee I'm asking you people to be courageous in this time amen now is not the time to back down amen I'm asking you to not let the church world even the message Church set your standard I'm saying let us be the standard amen come on now let us be the standard when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard I'm asking who will stand up and be counted in this time amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen amen amen now we find from 38 to 40 you're going to find here that they are trying to put a natural armor on David I'm not going to read it you can read it at home but remember the weapons of our Warfare are not caral but they are Mighty to God through God to the pulling down of strongholds amen so he took his staff in his hand this is verse 14 and shows him five smooth stones out of the brook amen and put them in his Shepherd bag which he had even in a script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the Philistine and the fistin came on and Drew near unto David and the man that be the shield went before him and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him oh don't think the the devil loves you he disdained him amen for he was but a youth and readyy and of a fair countenance and the Philistines said unto David am I a [Music] dog but who's David amen you see when the spirit of truth comes he will reveal all through because here's a god coming against a dog amen amen amen he's the God man you know there's truth in some things being spoken because he actually feels like a dog now am I a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his Gods you see this man is a Arian this man is a trinitarian he's saying I curse the spirit what's that thing Italian way of saying Father Son and Holy Ghost he cured him by his Gods praise the Lord and the Philistines said to David come to me and I will now watch I want to show you your false prophecy two prophecies in the midst of the battle Goliath is prophesying I will give thy flesh but what a foolish statement why am I saying this who has given dominion over the fowls of the air amen hello yes are you reading this who has given dominion over the fowls of the and the Beast of the field Genesis 126 let them have dominion so how can these things have dominion over a man of God Amen I'm showing you Satan trying to tell this man God made you to have dominion over this but I'm going to make these things have dominion over you so basically he's going against Genesis 126 here amen praise the Lord amen so fouls of the a beast of the field as Genesis 1: 126 David must have dominion over them now watch David doesn't leave and I don't want you to leave any word coming against you to be the last word yes sons of God will always have the last word so I'm saying prophesy again when a prophesy is coming against you prophesy again when Aon prophesied against Esther and the children of Israel she prophesied again amen the doctor says this this this and you're not going to get you prophesy again the word says this this and this and I sh am healed amen Hallelujah your boss comes to you and said you'll never get a promotion don't accept that word say you may say these things to me but I say in the name of the Lord that I shall have this amen praise the Lord amen whose report will you believe yes David Goes to prophesy again and then said David to the Philistine thou comes to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I now watch he is not saying I'm coming to you with a slingstone I am not coming to you with a staff watch out David is approaching the battle yes he's not relying on weapons the the weapons of our Warfare not carnal he's not relying his strength and his hope is not in that slingshot he knows that this is just an ordinary slingshot he knows it's not possible humanly possible for him to defeat goath like on a natural basis he knows what am I trying to say that he must have Supernatural assistance yes amen hallelujah amen I come to thee in the name of the Lord of host now what's host yes Angelic Warfare I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom whom thou has defiled I want you to pray over your son over your daughter over your husband and your wife Satan has come to defy you've come to defy the Son of God yeah this daughter of God yes you see too many of us are too comfortable with the devil we accommodate sickness we accommodate the devil amen we'll change everything we'll change diets we'll change amen our lifestyle we'll change everything to accommodate a sickness because we don't realize we don't realize what demon is that it's a spirit amen so when you accommodate the sickness you're actually accommodating the spirit amen yes hallelujah praise the Lord yes this day watch his prophecy this day the Lord will deliver thee into my hand amen and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee yeah Hallelujah yes amen you see you go for the head you go for the head praise the Lord you kill it at the head you kill that sickness at the head you kill anything coming against you at the head I will take that head from thee praise the Lord and I will give the carcass of the host of the Philistines now watch he's not only prophesying over Goliath he's prophesying over that entire Army over every 200 million demons am church can you see this he is not only prophesying that I'm going to kill you Goliath you see this Army here hello amen I will smite thee take that hi from thee and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fouls of the here who has dominion over that now and to the wild beast of the earth that all the Earth may know there is a God in Israel amen amen I tell you this bride
