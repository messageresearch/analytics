[6:28] morning we'll turn to the
[6:30] Book of Matthew
[6:33] 12 we read from verse
[6:37] 38-42 and the Lord has been blessing us
[6:39] week after week so we just want to see
[6:41] what he has in store for us this morning
[6:48] amen Matthew 12:
[6:52] 38-42 then the certain of the scribes
[6:54] and of the Pharisees answered saying
[6:56] Master we would see a sign from from
[7:00] thee but he answered and said unto them
[7:02] an evil an adulterous generation seeked
[7:06] after a sign and there shall no sign be
[7:10] given to it but the sign of the prophet
[7:12] Jonah for as Jonah was three days and
[7:15] three nights in the whale's belly so
[7:17] shall the son of man be three days and
[7:18] three nights in the heart of the
[7:21] Earth the men of Neva shall rise in
[7:23] judgment with with this generation and
[7:25] shall condemn it because they repented
[7:28] at the preaching of Jonah and behold a
[7:31] greater than Jonah is here amen the
[7:34] queen of the South shall rise up in the
[7:35] Judgment with this generation and shall
[7:38] condemn it for she came from the utmost
[7:41] parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of
[7:43] Solomon and behold a greater than
[7:47] Solomon is here amen amen you may be
[7:52] seated also turn to the Book of
[7:54] Revelation
[7:57] 10:1 and I saw another another Mighty
[7:59] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[8:02] a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[8:05] and his face was as it were the Sun and
[8:08] his feet as pillers of fire and he had
[8:10] in his hand a little book open and set
[8:12] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[8:14] foot on the earth and cried with a loud
[8:16] voice when as when a lion roar it and
[8:19] when he had cried seven Thunders uttered
[8:22] their
[8:23] voices amen so we know
[8:26] that we are awakened by the seven amen
[8:30] we've given our true identification we
[8:32] see the mystery of ourselves under the
[8:34] mystery of the Seven Seals amen amen and
[8:37] the Thunders come to reveal those
[8:39] Mysteries amen which were those Thunders
[8:42] were revealed under the Seven Seals and
[8:45] I was about to write and I Heard a Voice
[8:47] from Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[8:49] things which the seven Thunders answered
[8:51] and R them not and the angel which I saw
[8:54] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[8:56] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[8:59] by him that lived forever and ever who
[9:01] created heaven and the things that
[9:03] therein are and the earth and the things
[9:04] that therein
[9:06] are and the Sea and the things which are
[9:09] therein that there should be time no
[9:10] longer but in the days of the voice of
[9:12] the seven Angel when he shall begin to
[9:15] sound the mystery of God should be
[9:17] finished as he had declared to his
[9:19] servants the prophets amen so here here
[9:22] the prophet had to come into an age when
[9:25] these Thunders had to be revealed amen
[9:28] so he was preserved for a specific age
[9:30] amen
[9:32] amen we had the the age of reformers yes
[9:36] but in this
[9:38] age all the mystery of God has been
[9:42] revealed Amen in this age the word has
[9:45] been unlocked to us in this age we see
[9:49] ourselves in the scripture we see that
[9:53] hiden mystery because the prophet of God
[9:55] preaches the message Christ is the
[9:57] mystery of God revealed and he say is
[9:59] Christ you have to see Christ in every
[10:01] page of the book amen and the Mystery
[10:04] hid in Christ was the bride amen now at
[10:09] the time when the prophet is preaching
[10:10] it many wasn't catching it because it
[10:13] wasn't meant for that hour but this is
[10:16] the hour where that mystery is unlocked
[10:19] that everything the Prophet come to do
[10:22] and the the purpose that he came on the
[10:24] earth for was to call out a bride yes
[10:27] and he's preaching a message
[10:30] specifically for a bride amen amen and
[10:36] the voice which are heard from heav
[10:37] spake unto me again and said go and take
[10:39] the little book which is opening the
[10:41] hand of the Angel which standed upon the
[10:43] sea and upon the Earth and I went unto
[10:46] the angel and said unto him give me the
[10:48] little book and he said unto me take it
[10:50] this is asked now and eat it up and it
[10:52] shall make thy belly butter but it shall
[10:55] be in the mouth sweet as honey and I
[10:57] took the little book out of the Angel's
[10:58] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[11:00] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[11:03] heaten it my belly was bter and he said
[11:05] unto me thou must prophesy again before
[11:07] many peoples and Nations and tongues and
[11:09] Kings amen
[11:12] so we thank God that God sent us this
[11:15] Prophet because without this Prophet on
[11:16] the earth the word of the Lord must come
[11:18] to a prophet
[11:20] amen when Jesus
[11:23] came he had to present himself to the
[11:26] prophets at the River Jordan because the
[11:29] word of the God must come to the
[11:32] prophets yes so that is the order of God
[11:35] Amen and this Prophet have to receive
[11:38] this
[11:39] word this Mysteries couldn't be unlocked
[11:42] without a prophet on the
[11:45] Earth but a prophet to be on the Earth
[11:47] when the mighty Angel comes
[11:50] down and the reason he being receiving
[11:53] this word is for a specific people oh
[11:56] yes amen amen and he's going to preach
[11:59] this word and it's going to be stored up
[12:01] until the hour amen when the when the
[12:05] time is growing now amen then the
[12:07] fivefold is going to take the same words
[12:10] amen because everything must be in the
[12:12] word everything that a true fivefold
[12:14] preaches must be contained in the
[12:18] message and the fivefold is going to
[12:20] come under the same
[12:22] Spirits because it's the same Holy Ghost
[12:25] they going to be anointed to preach this
[12:27] gospel amen and they're going to now
[12:30] make sense to this words they're going
[12:32] to bring it in the present hour amen
[12:34] amen they're going to take this word
[12:36] that the prophet have preach because the
[12:37] prophet one day he saying to bully Paul
[12:39] did you did you catch that did you catch
[12:42] what I preach he said yes Dad he said
[12:44] buly Paul did you really catch it did
[12:46] you really understand what I preach then
[12:48] the prophet looked at him and he looked
[12:50] at the prophet and said no dad he said
[12:52] not many people caught that because
[12:55] there was a specific all that he was
[12:57] preaching at that time was was locked up
[12:59] for the now time amen thank you Lord yes
[13:03] so you see why the Church the true
[13:06] church or the body needs the five4
[13:09] ministry yes amen there's a specific
[13:12] role for the five4 ministry to build
[13:14] this body Amen to bring her to
[13:16] Perfection until she is perfected amen
[13:19] amen we speaking a topic this
[13:22] morning the presence of God unrecognized
[13:26] you know the prophet preaches the
[13:27] message the presence pres of God
[13:31] unrecognized and for the subtit subtitle
[13:33] we preaching the Holy Ghost is the sign
[13:37] of his
[13:38] appearing amen the Holy Ghost must be
[13:41] displayed in every age
[13:44] amen but in this age he comes down in
[13:48] his fullness amen
[13:52] yes he says the prophet of God says we
[13:56] know him now as much as our Liber liting
[13:59] senses can let
[14:01] us but one day it will be face to
[14:05] face that is for this
[14:10] age he is coming at the end of this age
[14:13] how many believe we at the End of the
[14:15] Age amen amen so he says partial
[14:20] realization will be made perfect
[14:23] realization am completed
[14:27] realization
[14:30] Hallelujah we have been looking through
[14:32] a glass

[14:41] glory amen but soon it will be right in
[14:46] the glory amen and in his glory will
[14:51] shine amen amen this is where the glory
[14:54] the Shina glory of the Lord has come
[14:58] down in his Temple yes because his
[15:01] Temple fly framed together from all
[15:04] parts of the world this body has come
[15:06] now to a place where the Shak Glory has
[15:09] come down to dwell in her and His glory
[15:13] be projected through her

[15:19] we shall be like him Hallelujah
[15:22] wondrously like him Jesus our savior
[15:26] Divine isn't that wonderful we are
[15:29] complete in him amen this is true he
[15:33] would not lie to us about
[15:36] that but one day we will be changed in
[15:40] the atoms we will put on immortality we
[15:43] will be all swallowed up in life then we
[15:47] realize
[15:49] realization amen what hour we living in
[15:53] he says in 1 Corinthians 13 says for
[15:56] when that which is perfect is
[16:00] that which is in part shall be done away
[16:02] with so all these things of jumping up
[16:05] and down like a kid trying to talk in
[16:07] tongues and all these other things when
[16:10] that which is perfect and we do have
[16:13] today by God's help the perfect
[16:16] interpretation of the word with Divine
[16:19] Vindication amen yes amen that couldn't
[16:22] come down until 1963 yes when the mighty
[16:25] Angel comes down amen and he had to come
[16:28] to a prophet yes to bring the perfect
[16:32] interpretation of the word with Divine
[16:35] Vindication was that word Vindicated
[16:37] with a pull of fire was that word
[16:39] Vindicated with a cloud amen and with
[16:43] signs and wonders amen then that which
[16:46] is perfect is done away with sorry that
[16:50] which is in part is done away with amen
[16:54] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[16:57] understood as a child but when I become
[16:59] a
[17:00] man I put away childish things oh lord
[17:04] is my salvation secure do we have
[17:07] eternal security childish things by now
[17:10] you should know that you are passed from
[17:13] Death unto
[17:15] life amen you were born in sin shaped in
[17:18] iniquity your spirit the spirit dropped
[17:22] into a flesh body a body that's going to
[17:25] die but when it's but the je are being a

[17:35] Christ you have now received his life
[17:39] amen and now when you have received the
[17:41] new birth youart from Death that you

[18:30] Satan is reminding you of temporal
[18:33] things Satan is reminding you of your

[18:46] and failures a body that's not
[18:49] perfected but when you come into Christ

[19:44] Authority amen and therefore now when
[19:47] you pray you know how to pray amen yes
[19:50] amen when now when you pray you pray
[19:52] with confidence the thing that you
[19:54] asking God for you know that when you
[19:56] speak it must come to pass amen when you
[20:00] speak you know that he hears you when
[20:02] you speak you are speaking with
[20:04] authority you are speaking with
[20:06] confidence that Lord you say I have need
[20:10] of this or my brother has need of that
[20:12] you know that when you speak it it must
[20:14] come to
[20:19] pass
[20:22] amen so let's speak now we speaking
[20:25] about the presence of God unrecognized
[20:29] the prophet of God says the unrecognized
[20:33] presence what could these people be
[20:35] thinking off God is always it's been the
[20:39] way every time he come when Jesus was
[20:43] here the first time he said you whiten
[20:45] and you garnish the walls and the tombs
[20:48] of the prophets and you put them in
[20:51] there see something happens it passes by
[20:54] and God hides it from the eyes of wise
[20:57] and prudent and reveals it to babe s
[21:02] such as will learn now Jesus thanked the
[21:05] father for doing such it goes right by
[21:07] the people and they don't know
[21:10] it he says now in the days of the
[21:13] prophets what happened they did the same
[21:15] thing they didn't recognize them till
[21:17] they had done come Ministry had finished
[21:20] took out of that they elected and then
[21:23] after that they were gone they
[21:25] recognized that they had been a prophet
[21:27] amongst them Jesus he came to the Earth
[21:30] andow with him was the father God I and
[21:35] my father are one my father dwelleth in
[21:39] me it's not me that doeth the works but
[21:43] my father and if I do not the works of
[21:46] my father believe me not amen now if you
[21:49] notice when he came about 11 19th of the
[21:53] world knew that he was uh do not World
[21:57] knew that he was even even on Earth at
[21:58] that time and yet the savior of the
[22:00] world and then they never recognized who
[22:04] he was even the churches or no one else
[22:08] atly knew atly until they had crucified
[22:12] him buried him and Rose on the third day
[22:15] before they ever know who he was it
[22:17] comes in and goes out and people does
[22:20] not recognize it until it's passed and
[22:23] they because it never fits their
[22:26] Theology and it never f the time of the
[22:29] day see what it is they're always living
[22:31] in a glare of another age yeah amen so
[22:36] we find that the same thing is happening
[22:39] today amen as it happened in Jesus day
[22:42] as it happened all the other times when
[22:44] they had the prophets on the earth They
[22:46] Crucified the
[22:48] prophets and when the prophets when the
[22:50] days of the Prophet go past then they
[22:51] garnish the
[22:53] tombs the same thing happened today when
[22:56] Willam brandham was here he he wasn't
[22:58] recognized he wasn't well received when
[23:01] he brought forth the word he was well
[23:03] received under the first two pools but
[23:05] when he came to the opening of the word
[23:06] it was it wasn't well received amen amen
[23:10] and now that the property is of the
[23:12] scene now the we we have a message world
[23:16] and people around the world have
[23:18] recognized this message
[23:20] amen but some people are still living in
[23:23] the glare of another age now he has come
[23:26] to do his part revelation 7 but there's
[23:29] a revelation 10 8-11 amen amen he was
[23:34] preaching specifically for us he was

[23:46] amen they must prophesy again amen but
[23:49] once
[23:50] again when God is now coming amongst

[23:55] remember the Holy Ghost is a sign of of
[23:58] his appearing now when the Holy Ghost
[24:00] comes
[24:00] down that means God is here amongst his
[24:04] people when the Holy Ghost is now in a
[24:07] many membered
[24:08] body under John 14:12 says Greater Works
[24:12] than these ye shall do amen now that's
[24:15] the presence of God that's unrecognized
[24:17] in this
[24:19] hour we have many theologians that came
[24:22] and you can interpret the word and show
[24:25] you the things that will happen in the
[24:27] scriptures and show you what happened in
[24:28] the prophet's time but they can't see
[24:31] that the prophet they can't catch the
[24:33] mystery of Christ The Mystery of God the
[24:37] mystery was the bride the mystery was
[24:40] the body amen amen the mystery was the
[24:43] body to be made perfect the mystery was
[24:46] the body for the final work because she
[24:48] becomes the final voice in the final
[24:51] age amen the word was Tau up that when
[24:54] she recognized it and she becomes like
[24:57] him the more she becomes into His Image

[25:04] become that super church amen she'll
[25:06] become the one without spot without
[25:08] blemish amen she'll be the one doing the
[25:11] Greater Works she'll be the one that can
[25:14] forgive sins you say oh my word forgive
[25:18] sins yes yes the Bible said even even
[25:21] she's going to be judging the Earth
[25:24] don't you know that the saint shall
[25:26] judge the Earth
[25:31] on that day on the Judgment Day they
[25:34] going to people going to become there
[25:36] maybe they never Reed the message never
[25:39] receive the
[25:40] word but he said don't you know if you
[25:43] give a glass of water to one of these my
[25:46] little
[25:47] ones you shall surely not lose your
[25:50] reward amen but if you offend one of
[25:53] these my little
[25:55] ones it's better for a mstone to be hang
[25:58] on you
[26:00] right so you see it's going to be a
[26:03] fierce thing on the day of judgment this
[26:07] bride that is in such humility right now
[26:10] she's not recognized in the world she
[26:13] doesn't have the pump of the world she's
[26:15] not recognized in the church
[26:19] world but she's the super Church she's
[26:22] rising up in power right now in this
[26:23] hour amen she's displaying his
[26:26] characteristics she become the
[26:28] continuation of the book of Acts amen
[26:30] but this is not for the public show this
[26:32] is for the specific people amen amen
[26:35] she's going to go out and there might be
[26:37] people that will come to her that people
[26:39] will need healing people will need help
[26:42] and she will be there on display but
[26:44] it's not for the public
[26:52] show it say
[26:56] here
[26:58] 1 Corinthians 13 says when that which is
[27:01] perfect is come okay I read
[27:07] that he says the reason they didn't
[27:10] accept Jesus because they were living in
[27:12] the glare of the law and when Jesus came
[27:15] was not contrary to the law but come to
[27:18] fulfill the law well they couldn't
[27:21] accept him because his message wasn't
[27:23] exactly the way they had it all treated
[27:25] out and it was called all them
[27:28] traditions and he didn't come according
[27:30] to their Traditions he didn't come he
[27:33] didn't keep to their tradition and
[27:35] really he upset it toy it up and done
[27:39] things that was contrary to it in so
[27:42] much that they thought he was breaking
[27:44] up the churches and they couldn't
[27:46] receive him because of his message yes
[27:48] and we all know today that he come
[27:51] exactly in the line of God's prophecy
[27:53] but they didn't know it then and it
[27:55] could happen again and we wouldn't know
[27:58] it I imagine if you would actually
[28:00] appear tonight it would be so contrary
[28:04] to what we've all got figured out up on
[28:07] our charts in our schools and things it
[28:09] would be a very few would recognize
[28:11] what's going on he said it would be that
[28:14] how he come yes amen and now when he's
[28:17] appearing once
[28:19] again amen how is he appearing now
[28:22] through a many member body yes he's
[28:25] appearing through his body amen but they
[28:27] cannot see Beyond the
[28:29] Veil amen people are looking at the veil
[28:32] they are looking at here's normal people
[28:34] on the Earth yes people with faults and
[28:37] failures but they're not looking Beyond
[28:39] the Veil that God is doing a work right
[28:41] now through this body amen amen they're
[28:44] not recognizing the presence of God
[28:46] dwelling in
[28:48] there yes amen such an hour if that can
[28:53] be recognized now can you imagine what a
[28:55] church this would be yes amen
[28:58] can can you imagine what a powerful
[28:59] church this would be when this church
[29:02] recognizes right now I'm talking about
[29:04] the entire body of Christ in such a
[29:05] Unity come and recognize that the
[29:08] presence of God is right now dwelling in
[29:10] her
[29:11] amen that she is the final voice right
[29:14] now that she is the hope to a dying
[29:17] generation amen she is the Hope for
[29:19] cancer she is the Hope for TB she is the
[29:22] Hope for heart disease she is the Hope
[29:24] for diabetes she is the Hope for for for
[29:27] the backslider she is the Hope for the
[29:29] person that the viol sinner right now
[29:32] who everybody gave up
[29:35] on Amen she's the Power House of God
[29:39] she's the M piece of
[29:41] God
[29:44] Amen she is the continuation of the book
[29:47] of
[29:48] Acts amen now Jesus there so
[29:51] scripturally identified by the
[29:54] scriptures and the scribes and the
[29:56] Pharisees of that day could could not
[29:57] recognize him you see where Jesus were
[30:00] identified by the scriptures yes she
[30:05] must be identified with the
[30:08] scriptures she must see herself in the
[30:11] word she
[30:13] must I trust we seeing ourselves in the
[30:15] word amen we're not seeing ourselves as
[30:18] just people that are called Christians
[30:20] coming to church uh marking oursel
[30:22] present in a assembly with the people
[30:25] but we see ourselves in the word amen
[30:28] yes amen and when we see oursel in the
[30:31] word we recognize what we ought to do
[30:34] amen we recognize his instructions for
[30:36] us and how is the instruction is coming
[30:39] is coming through the five4 ministry
[30:41] making us live lives that are not
[30:43] contrary to the word making us become so
[30:48] surrendered to Jesus amen that we
[30:50] separate oursel from the things of the
[30:52] world we don't dress up like the people
[30:54] of the world we don't act like the
[30:56] people of the world world because we
[30:58] recognize that we are a different bunch
[31:00] of people amen yes the world is OD the
[31:04] oddballs to us and we are OD Balls to
[31:06] the world
[31:10] Amen he
[31:13] says the Pharisees of that day couldn't
[31:16] did not recognize him why didn't they
[31:19] why didn't they do it because they had
[31:21] it figured out some other way that's
[31:23] where Jesus told them search the
[31:25] scriptures for in them you think you
[31:27] have eternal life and they are they the
[31:29] testify of me now we come exactly with
[31:32] the scriptures but they figured it out
[31:34] maybe that it would come the Messiah
[31:36] would probably do what Moses did or what
[31:39] Noah did build them ark or
[31:42] something but reason he come the way he
[31:45] did they hadn't figured it out in the
[31:47] scriptures with their traditions did not
[31:49] teach them so the people were so
[31:51] confused they didn't know what was going
[31:56] on
[31:59] he said look at the day we living in
[32:01] what's promised for this day what are we
[32:05] we moved on up the pillar of fire
[32:10] moves and the children of Israel moved
[32:13] with the pillar of fire or they went
[32:15] back to Egypt we've got to move with the
[32:19] word amen amen if we don't move with the
[32:22] word we don't recognize what the holy
[32:25] spirit is doing in his hour
[32:27] that he might as well go back to Egypt
[32:29] you might as well go back to the word
[32:32] cuz God don't remain stagnant the Holy
[32:34] Ghost is always on the move the Holy
[32:37] Ghost is always doing a new
[32:39] thing but the sad part is when the Holy
[32:42] Ghost is doing a new thing and is
[32:44] impacting the and he wants to have an
[32:46] impact people don't the presence of God
[32:49] becomes
[32:50] unrecognized because why is not in the
[32:52] popular theory of the
[32:54] day amen M people have their own mindset
[32:59] of the way God works but if you just
[33:02] surrender to the holy spirit
[33:04] amen because people who are a gene of
[33:07] God have passed from De sin brought
[33:11] Jesus Paid the price to redeem us
[33:13] back amen his Spirit come upon
[33:16] us now we we know that as I said earlier
[33:20] we born in a body that contains death
[33:24] everything about his body is
[33:25] negative everything about his body is
[33:28] going to outside the spirit of God
[33:30] outside the Holy Ghost is going to put
[33:33] you in a problem amen but under the new
[33:36] birth we have passed from Death unto
[33:38] life
[33:40] yes those that are quickened we have the
[33:43] earnest of the change inside of us right
[33:46] now amen we are quickened by this words
[33:51] the Holy Spirit come with a quickening
[33:53] power amen amen yes
[33:57] our body now is turning Heavenly amen
[34:00] amen yes it
[34:02] doesn't it doesn't feel for the things
[34:05] of the Earthly
[34:06] things amen because out of the earth we
[34:09] come just like our God is going to
[34:12] renovate this Earth one day he's
[34:14] renovating this body the Holy Ghost
[34:17] comes with fire in this hour amen amen
[34:20] the Holy Ghost comes with fire and he's
[34:22] renovating this body amen amen he's
[34:25] turning into a new body amen amen he's
[34:28] taking out all the things he's burning
[34:31] up all the sin burning up all changing
[34:33] your nature changing the way you think
[34:36] amen changing the way you you do
[34:39] things
[34:41] amen hallelujah making it a foot
[34:44] dwelling place for the Holy Ghost to
[34:46] dwell in
[34:47] because God is going to come and Rule
[34:49] and reign with the Saints in the
[34:50] Millennium and a new in the Millennium
[34:53] and after the Millennium is going to
[34:54] renovate the Earth and when he renovates
[34:58] the Earth it becomes a foot Dwelling
[35:00] Place For Us
[35:02] amen just like that now you must
[35:04] renovate this Earth amen we worried
[35:07] about that Earth but we start with this
[35:09] Earth
[35:12] amen and when he does that when he turns
[35:14] us Heavenly who's on display it's the
[35:16] glory of God that is on display
[35:20] amen amen is the glory of God displayed
[35:24] because
[35:25] why remember all these
[35:28] years God never had out outside of the
[35:30] prophet of God in this hour God never
[35:33] had a
[35:35] mouthpiece the church was his own
[35:37] mouthpiece but God needed somebody to
[35:40] become its
[35:41] mouthpiece amen and now we got a people
[35:44] that become his mouthpiece amen yes amen
[35:48] because she becomes In His Image
[35:52] yes he says now remember this Christ in
[35:56] the true
[35:57] church is a
[35:59] continuation of the book of Acts amen
[36:03] don't let anyone say us otherwise
[36:05] because he says is a
[36:08] continuation of the book of Acts that
[36:11] mean there must be Progressive amen yes
[36:14] it must come to great because the Bible
[36:16] say we change from Glory unto glory
[36:20] amen but the Book of Revelation shows
[36:23] out that the Antichrist Spirit would
[36:26] come into the church and defile it
[36:29] making it lwam formal and
[36:32] Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his
[36:36] Works attempted destruction of God's
[36:39] people and discrediting of God's word
[36:42] right down to the time he is cast into
[36:44] the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[36:47] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[36:51] people amen could get the true
[36:54] revelation of the true church
[36:57] and what she is
[37:01] amen amen he's emphasizing the part on
[37:04] what she is yeah because that's this the
[37:07] hour now Jesus know who he was so the
[37:10] brandom knew who he
[37:12] was amen yes but she needs to know what
[37:16] she is
[37:18] amen what she stands for amen and that
[37:22] she can do the Greater Works oh thank
[37:26] you she will be an invincible Army amen
[37:29] and if they get a true revelation of the
[37:31] true Spirits within the framework of the
[37:34] Christian church and by God's spirit
[37:37] discerned and withad the Antichrist
[37:39] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[37:42] her amen he will be as definitely twed
[37:46] today as when Christ WTO stood his every
[37:48] effort to gain power over him in the
[37:50] desert yes Satan ate Revelation yes but
[37:53] we love it with true Revelation in our
[37:56] lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[37:58] against us but we will prevail over them
[38:01] so you
[38:03] see the mystery behind this
[38:06] is everything is pointing us to another
[38:10] age Satan will always allow that he's
[38:13] happy he satisfied that you can preach
[38:15] to of another age gone by Satan will be
[38:18] satisfied when you preach about
[38:20] something in the bygone days and say in
[38:23] those days we did this in those days we
[38:25] did that but what Satan
[38:28] hates amen when you recognize what the
[38:31] Holy Ghost is doing in his hour amen
[38:34] when you catch the move of the spirit
[38:37] and when you are in the move of the
[38:38] spirit Satan hates it because he knows
[38:41] if you catch the move of the spirit he
[38:43] will become powerless yes amen amen when
[38:45] you catch the move of the spirit he
[38:47] cannot stand against you amen when you
[38:50] catch the move of the spirit then you
[38:52] recognize God's mandate amen then you
[38:55] recognize what God is doing doing in his
[38:56] hour thank
[39:01] amen he says oh the greatest pleasure I
[39:04] know of is to be is to pray until I can
[39:08] realize that I'm in the presence of God
[39:10] and recognize it I think that ought to
[39:13] be the TR of the church is the presence
[39:16] of the Holy
[39:17] Spirit seeing the god that made the
[39:20] promise standing amongst us feel his
[39:24] presence and see his word and Vindicated
[39:27] it ought to give Faith to make cripples
[39:29] walk blind see de hear dumb speak amen
[39:34] amen this is the hour where you
[39:35] recognize now is not only with you he is
[39:39] in you amen yes amen and when you can
[39:42] recognize that he's in you he's
[39:44] recognized in your brother he's in your
[39:46] sister he's amongst each one of you then
[39:48] you all look at your brother's Falls you
[39:50] w look at your sister's Falls amen you
[39:53] will look at the presence of God living
[39:55] in your brother
[39:57] all you will see is God in them yes Lord
[40:01] amen the accuser of the brother go and
[40:03] accuse you accuse your brother he
[40:05] accuses your sister we are not part of
[40:08] him amen we are part of Christ amen when
[40:12] you see a brother you see a Son of God
[40:14] when you see a sister you see a daughter
[40:16] of God thank you Lord amen you see God
[40:20] in them you see Christ in them that's
[40:22] who you see when I look at you I see
[40:25] Christ you look at me you should be
[40:27] seeing Christ yes amen amen Christ in
[40:31] you the hope of glory
[40:34] am and then what he said you'll do it'll
[40:36] give you Faith to what to make cripples
[40:39] walk to make the blind see to make the
[40:42] deaf here to make the dumb speak why
[40:44] it's giving you that Faith because you
[40:46] recognize that is now
[40:48] Christ in a body amen the body is just
[40:52] the veil but if you're looking within
[40:54] the veil you see Christ Pro rejected
[40:56] through the body you become reflective
[40:59] of Christ amen
[41:02] amen oh only the presence of God can be
[41:09] recognized see what he says here from a
[41:12] little group of the true seed of the
[41:14] word of God of the word God will present
[41:17] Christ with a beloved bride she is a
[41:20] virgin of his word she is a virgin
[41:23] because she knows no man-made Creeds or
[41:25] dog
[41:27] by and through the members of the Bride
[41:29] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[41:32] of God to be made manifest in the
[41:34] Virgin but the Word of Promise came to
[41:37] the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise
[41:40] was he himself to be made
[41:44] manifest God was made manifest now if
[41:48] the Word of Promise has come to us this
[41:50] Mary in this age so who is the word is
[41:53] he himself for what for him to be made
[41:57] manifest so when you receive the word he
[41:59] must be made manifest amen amen so what
[42:03] it is when you see yourself walking out
[42:05] of scripture you become that manifested
[42:07] word in this hour and when you become
[42:10] the manifested word then Satan is all
[42:12] shocked Satan don't know what to do he's
[42:15] left powerless because why you see
[42:17] yourself through the scripture because
[42:19] Satan cannot break
[42:22] scripture amen so I mean sorry Satan
[42:24] cannot change scripture he cannot change
[42:27] God's word God's word is y and amen it's
[42:31] settled amen so when you walk out of the
[42:33] scripture you're walking out of God's
[42:34] word which cannot be changed amen Satan
[42:38] can only pervert but he can't change
[42:40] God's original word amen yes
[42:43] amen so if you're working out the
[42:46] promise of your day there's nothing
[42:47] Satan can do because that is your
[42:50] promise for your day when you see your
[42:52] promise for your day Satan become
[42:54] powerless before you cuz he
[42:57] says he himself acted at a time and
[43:00] fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the
[43:02] Virgin it was an angel that brought her
[43:05] the message but the Angel's message was
[43:07] the word of God Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled
[43:10] at the time all that was written of him
[43:12] because she accepted his word to her to
[43:14] the members of the Virgin bride sorry
[43:17] the members of the Virgin bride will
[43:18] love him and they will have his
[43:23] potentials for he is their head see
[43:26] she's come now the through the fivefold
[43:29] ministry bringing the word being built
[43:30] up coming to The Headstone amen amen she
[43:34] comes and she comes under headship amen
[43:37] she comes under Authority she sorry she
[43:40] comes subjection to the Head she
[43:42] recognizes the
[43:44] authority and all power belongs to him
[43:47] they are subject to him as the members
[43:50] of our body are subject to our
[43:53] heads but notice the harmony of the
[43:55] father father and the son Jesus never
[43:58] did anything until it was first showed
[44:00] him by the Father John 5:19 the armony
[44:04] is now to exist between the groom and
[44:07] his bride he shows her his Word of Life
[44:12] she receives it and never doubts it
[44:16] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[44:20] de for if the seed be planted the water
[44:23] will raise it up again he said yeah is
[44:26] the secret of this the word is in the
[44:29] bride as it was in Mary the Bride As the
[44:32] mind of Christ for she knows what he
[44:34] wants done with the word she performs
[44:36] the command of the word in his name for
[44:39] she has thus say the Lord amen amen so
[44:42] are we waiting for someone else to come
[44:44] and say thus say the Lord or she has
[44:46] thus say the Lord It's the bride amen
[44:49] the many member body she has thus say
[44:52] the Lord amen because she has his
[44:55] potentials yes amen then if she has th
[44:58] say the Lord what she
[45:00] speaks must come to pass because thus
[45:03] say the Lord but she won't speak until
[45:06] it's impressed upon her by his spirit
[45:09] because she recognizes his presence amen
[45:12] she recognizes the the Holy Spirit
[45:14] working within her she doesn't work
[45:16] contrary to the spirit she works with
[45:18] the spirit amen she's in Partnership
[45:22] she's in connection with the Holy
[45:24] Spirit and therefore now when she speak
[45:29] she's speaking under that connection
[45:31] with the spirit amen she has thus say
[45:33] the Lord she performs the command of the

[55:28] how the Bible say a woman should dress
[55:29] up a woman shouldn't be preaching a
[55:33] woman should know a position yes this is
[55:35] what the Bible say about a man should do
[55:38] how a man should treat his family how
[55:40] the man is now the provider of his home
[55:44] amen can you stand up with that word and
[55:46] say no this is what the word
[55:49] says yes there will be a people because
[55:52] he said so amen he prophet ided and
[55:56] God's word must come to pass God is not
[55:59] a man that he should

[59:55] when all the critics started coming
[59:57] about the
[59:59] cloud picking on the cloud R about the
[1:00:02] time we started preaching and I remember
[1:00:05] we were in a Minister's
[1:00:08] meeting and people and the ministers
[1:00:10] were talking about another Minister that
[1:00:14] were giving his version of the cloud and
[1:00:17] were coming out and
[1:00:19] they they were trying to like you know
[1:00:22] white wash it the agent said no I got
[1:00:25] the evidence I said if someone speak
[1:00:27] somebody is speaking directly about
[1:00:29] against the cloud listen to this and
[1:00:31] that's when we took our stand and he
[1:00:34] said when the prophet preaches the cloud
[1:00:36] he takes you to
[1:00:38] scripture and if something is in
[1:00:42] scripture Satan can't come against it
[1:00:44] that's
[1:00:46] right so just like that if we are in
[1:00:50] scripture then our part can't be taken
[1:00:52] out you can't add to this word you can't
[1:00:54] take out from this word we got to
[1:00:57] fulfill our paths you've got to
[1:00:59] recognize who you are in the word you
[1:01:03] got to recognize that you are the one
[1:01:04] stepping out of the word right now you
[1:01:07] become the manifested word in his
[1:01:10] hour so when someone comes against the
[1:01:13] word we got to take a stand no matter

[1:01:27] because we are part of God we can we
[1:01:29] cannot be separated from God and he is
[1:01:32] the word and we cannot be separated from
[1:01:35] the word so we are here to stand with
[1:01:38] his word amen no matter what we can lose
[1:01:41] friends we can lose Fellowship it
[1:01:43] doesn't matter we stay with the word
[1:01:46] amen and when we recognize what God is

[1:02:06] we're not looking at a day gone by we

[1:02:11] a specific purpose storing up a food for
[1:02:14] a specific people and I can say I am one
[1:02:17] of them amen you can say you are one of
[1:02:20] them amen that the word was stored up
[1:02:22] for us hallelujah will will become the
[1:02:25] Fulfillment of the words that we are no
[1:02:27] longer in a partial realization we are
[1:02:30] in a perfect realization hallah amen
[1:02:34] recognizing what is doing what God is
[1:02:36] doing in this hour recognizing the move
[1:02:38] of the spirit in this hour recognizing
[1:02:40] the Holy Ghost working in me working in
[1:02:43] you
[1:02:46] amen amen we are become his mouthpiece
[1:02:50] we want to do the works he wants to do
[1:02:52] if we don't surrender ourselves to him
[1:02:54] what is's going going to use in his hour
[1:02:56] because he selected us for his hour
[1:02:58] amen amen he's relying upon you and me
[1:03:01] right amen I mean that God has always
[1:03:03] relied upon man God has always used man
[1:03:06] yes he had to separate His prophets you
[1:03:09] know you know the stories of the Prophet
[1:03:12] when the prophet would listen to his
[1:03:14] mother-in-law and wouldn't go out what
[1:03:15] happened to
[1:03:16] him he had to face the consequences for
[1:03:19] that when he had to come to Der South
[1:03:22] Africa and he listened to the ministers
[1:03:24] yet he didn't want to listen to them
[1:03:26] because the Holy Spirit wanted him to
[1:03:27] come to Duran South Africa but when he
[1:03:29] went to Cape Town and Johannesburg what
[1:03:31] the what happened to
[1:03:36] him so just like that we got to stay
[1:03:39] with what God once we got to stay with
[1:03:42] his word
[1:03:43] amen it might not be popular it might
[1:03:46] not be in the best interest of
[1:03:49] everybody but let it be in the best
[1:03:51] interest of God
[1:03:53] Amen
[1:03:58] he said that's the reason they didn't
[1:03:59] accept Jesus because they were living in
[1:04:01] the glare of the law and when Jesus came
[1:04:03] was not contrary to the law but come to
[1:04:05] fulfill the law well they couldn't
[1:04:06] accept him because his message wasn't
[1:04:09] exactly the way they all had Creed it
[1:04:11] out and it was called then Traditions he
[1:04:14] didn't come according to the Traditions
[1:04:16] he didn't come didn't keep their
[1:04:17] tradition and really it accept it and
[1:04:20] toy it up and done things that was
[1:04:21] contrary to in so much that they thought
[1:04:23] he was breaking up the churches and they
[1:04:25] couldn't receive him because of his
[1:04:27] message and we all know today that he
[1:04:29] come exactly in the line of God's
[1:04:31] prophecy but they didn't know it
[1:04:34] then and he said that it could happen
[1:04:36] again we wouldn't know
[1:04:38] it and we wouldn't know wouldn't know H
[1:04:43] I imagine if we he would actually appear
[1:04:46] tonight it would be so contrary to what
[1:04:48] we all got figured up that's what I read
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:53] so
[1:04:54] if you had
[1:04:56] to people have got God they think they
[1:04:59] got God figured out but God is not like
[1:05:01] that God is a spirit amen and a spirit
[1:05:05] moving and dwelling in his body in
[1:05:08] bodies the 200 million demons on the
[1:05:10] Earth right now let loose God permitted
[1:05:13] them to be let loose but those Spirits
[1:05:17] those demons cannot do anything without
[1:05:19] working with
[1:05:21] bodies people in power people residents
[1:05:25] people in medicine bringing all these
[1:05:28] viruses and so forth all these
[1:05:30] scientists and so forth who you think
[1:05:33] is influencing them amen who you think
[1:05:37] is influencing those bodies those 200
[1:05:40] million demons in the midst of wars and
[1:05:43] so forth those 200 million demons all
[1:05:46] those people that are doing evil on the
[1:05:48] Earth all those people that bring in the
[1:05:50] Sodom condition those are demons yes
[1:05:52] amen Sodom was destroyed
[1:05:55] but Spirits don't die the people in
[1:05:57] Sodom died but those demon Spirits were
[1:06:00] laying for a time like this it was
[1:06:03] laying there but now they on the
[1:06:06] earth once again influence you think man
[1:06:09] just decided today I want to sin no they
[1:06:12] are influenced by evil
[1:06:14] power that is why in the time of the
[1:06:19] Millennium there there will be other
[1:06:21] people
[1:06:23] there living for the Thousand
[1:06:25] Years yet we'll be in within the they
[1:06:29] won't be with
[1:06:30] us
