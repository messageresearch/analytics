Pastor es Hallelujah and our friend we had Fellowship until around yes and Pastor M hallelujah amen so and you know I really want to appreciate God that as a minister you are always wondering because you want to preach what is in the will of God so when we were driving with pastor Denzel when we were just fellowshipping what he was saying pastor Esko he was confirming what I wanted to preach and I I would want to tell you friends that sometimes you know we are friends so I'll tell you the truth even in the convention sometimes I would come brother M from the hotel you know battling in my mind which Simon must I preach yes and then maybe during the song service he then God just okay let me talk about that I don't think that I ever came to the hotel with a seon can you imagine so because I was sometimes we be having two Salmons to preach you don't know which one must I preach and then something just happens and God tells you preach this one and when I was with a man of God in the study there you know he was confirming again even what he was saying here his remarks he was just confirming what I wanted to talk about Hallelujah so let's just go straight to the word amen you know I'm already free already amen hallelujah because brother Bram says where Christ is welcome I'm also welcome Hallelujah so God bless you Pastor for the open doors so you know we were talking to say hey I wish one of these days Pastor Adrian will also come to Zimbabwe Amen to be a blessing too Hallelujah so that he comes and tell us all these nuggets hallelujah amen Matthew chapter 4 brother Denzel is always a blessing Amen in Z I've never had an evil report Hallelujah if it wasn't so I would have told you Hallelujah but so far so good amen hallelujah amen so it's just like Aran you know even me I remember you know the Bible says shama the son of AI the harite so har was in the Bible so I'm a harite amen so Matthew 4 verse 16 let's start from verse 15 he says the land of zapan and the land of napim by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which set in darkness saw great light and to them which set in in the region of the shadow of death light is sprung up amen we may be seated so we are talking about the Vindicated light of this day amen amen the Vindicated light of this day amen amen I'm happy to see brother calb Hallelujah so I I thought I was going to see that little girl Hallelujah but we believe all is well amen hallelujah amen so I just want to go straight H to the word of God let's read in the message God's word it cause for a total separation from unbelief 64121 paragraph 10 says now if God said let they be light and there was no light then that isn't that wasn't God said that see when God says anything he must back up brother he must back up what he says so do you see brother Adrian what you were saying I feel that the devil is finished already hallah we are in the will of God we are not here by coincidence Hallelujah if God says something he must back up what he has said amen how many believe that amen amen amen praise the Lord praise God if God said H let they be light and there was no light huh how are being blessed When God says anything he must back up what he says and when the word of God has been a Vindicated yes hey the word hallelujah been a Vindicated that is light so what is light is the Vindicated word of God is the manifested word of God hallelujah if the word is not manifest then that's not light we are not talking about this electricity that's not the light the light is the word of God that has been manifested that has been Vindicated so we are not talking about the prophecy we are talking about the manifestation of the prophecy we are living in the days of the manifestation of the prophecy amen how many can say Amen oh I like that Pastor Den amen the word has been what Vindicated amen that is light brother KH if the word is not manifested if the word is not Vindicated then we are not walking in the light when we say brother Esko we are walking in the light we are walking in the Vindicated hallelujah hallelujah while brother is resting hallelujah [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the Lord hey I'm enjoying are you happy my brother amen oh my pastor denel now the word i a a listen now the word itself H this is a bomb I can't now the word itself is in Delight until it's a Vindicated Delight hallelujah hallelujah the word itself isn't light until it's Vindicated amen can I repeat it again oh pastor this is serious how many can say amen amen this is what you were saying in the car so I was just listening while we were just fellowshipping you were just confirming my message hallelujah amen hallelujah amen how been blessed amen yes sir now huh are we being blessed amen huh he said yeah so yeah I I just skipped it now the way itself isn't light until it's a Vindicated light hallelujah amen so when we say when we just preach the word alone it's not enough amen hallelujah can I say this Hallelujah Pastor H listen the Bible is the word of God hallu are we together but the message of the hour is the will of God for the whole Bible is not the will of God for us the Bible is the word of God but the scriptures of our day how many can say Amen the message of the hour is the will of God for you and me the whole word the whole Bible how many can say Amen cannot help you how many can say Amen but the message of the hour how many can say Amen is the will of God for you and me that's why brother Pam says Noah if he had come with Jesus message it was not going to help neither could Jesus come with Moses message we have the message of our day Hallelujah so if the word for today is manifested that's the light when John the Baptist was asked what sayest thou of thyself are you the one or shall we wait for another he never said I am John the Baptist no you know those people were asking him they knew that he was John zakariah even the people who took who helped him to get the the passport and the birth certificate they knew he was John Zachariah but when they said who are you what says Thou of thyself they were not expecting him to say John zakar they wanted his scriptural identification hallelujah how many can say you must know you know you not not I have my scripture identification hallelujah how many can say amen hallelujah amen amen how many are enjoying huh pastor this is too much man now the word I can close here the word itself is in light amen until it's what a Vindicated light and can I say this how many can say amen amen there is a spoken word hallelujah there is a what a written word and there is also a manifested word and I also want to say the spoken word as good as it is it cannot help you the written word as good as it is it cannot help you what will help you is the manifested way how many sayuj Hallelujah we want the spoken word to be manifested we want the written word to be manifested hallelujah oh Pastor Denzel do you know that the Pharisees were preaching every Sabbath the virin shall conceive virin shall conceive it did not help them but listen it's easy to see to to believe the spoken word it's easy to to believe the man the written word but it's not easy to believe the manifested word Glory you go to the denominations now and read to them behold I send you Elijah they will say Amen to that but if you say Elijah he has come Elijah is here and he malach 4 ah his brother B that's where the problem start you started well but you said this man great seven he is the Elijah you see now it's easy to believe Malachi 4 when it is being preached but when you say the men behold the men Ah that's where the problem is if we preach about the kind Gentlemen people will rejoice but if I say behold the kind gentlemen say no no no maybe I think he must be from America or something how if you say behold that kind if you say that kind gentleman is here how many can say Amen it's not easy my brother you you think it's easy to believe that the spoken word is easy to believe the written word is easy but to believe how many manifested it hallu the Pharisees were always rejoicing RAB rski thees were always saying a virgin shall conceive every Sabbath but when the Virgin conceived they never saw it they stoned that virgin They Crucified the Virgin so it's the grace of God it takes an predestinated seed of God to see the word of God manifested how many can say Amen am hey brother M when you see scriptures being fulfilled is the grace of God it's not easy yes do you know what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost brother is the Fulfillment of scripture Hallelujah listen in the upper room the Holy Ghost came down are we together and people did not know what is it the people said no these men are drunk and what but Peter stood up and said these men are not drunk this is that which was prophesied by the prophet Jo so what is the Holy Ghost the Fulfillment of scripture how many can say am this

Hallelujah when we speak the word and things happen amen pastor this is that when people are are sick and they are healed of the cancers we say this is that am how many can say Amen the manifestation Hallelujah the light of the day when we say we are walking in the light such a beautiful light what is that the Fulfillment of the scriptures for our day how many say tell your neighbor say the written as good as it is it won't help you yes Hallelujah the spoken word as good as it is it can't help you what will help you is the manifested word this every Revelation must end in the flesh amen

Veil of circumstances how many can say amen amen them is those they are praise the Lord you know I just want to type this again you know I'm still still okay let me try to to type this I I want you to see something if I can get it I really enjoyed that Hallelujah listen to this hallelujah amen are you are you blessed Hallelujah are you being blessed you are going to close now don't worry everything is fine Hallelujah I want you to see I want to this it struck me listen Pastor when I saw this I said oh la in the message H God's only provided place of worship 65128 a.m. watch now I was sitting over there talking to my old friend brother Brown while the songs was going on like when the the pastor was in the study there you know while the songs was going on brother Bram was in the study and brother Brown something happened to him he rushed to the what to the office of the prophet he said no I don't care I'm prepared to break protocol today just entered into the into his office he says I was sitting over there talking to my old friend brother Brown while the songs was going on and and he said brother Bram I never seen it till yesterday what you have been talking about he said If people could grasp H If people could get into what you are speaking about said every obstacle will move out of the way that's exactly right that's right it's exactly right if you could just grasp it could catch it so I want to say church if you could grasp what was being said Hallelujah during the Easter if you could grasp what your pastors are always preaching if you could grasp what brother Bram is always talking about every obstacle will move out of the way the power of knowledge if you can grasp why the seals were open amen every OB the go will go you know it struck me Pastor Denzel so it means he was always coming to church not understanding what brother was talking about but something was revealed to him how many can say Amen I'm telling you even the the the prodal son you know do you know what redeems you do you know what delivers you is not being prayed for if a revelation strikes you you are delivered that's why even the Bible it says the got eyes but they can't see they've got ears but they can't hear Hallelujah and the Bible says let they've got eyes and they can't see L they see and understand and be healed and be converted this is the The Secret of being healed and being converted is not all about prayer meetings but if you catch it that's why someone says I understand it I've caught it then you are how many can say so we are preaching so that you catch it if you can only catch it then everything is over halluel is preaching Hallelujah and then you understand it then you are healed because the Bible says so God blinded their understanding so that they don't get converted but when you see it you understand it you are healed you are delivered you are converted how many can say Amen amen that's our purpose I'm preaching so that you understand it so that that's why sometimes I can come with what five or 10 quotations but sometimes I just read two and I see people have got it they've got it I go I don't have to continue I know how many can say amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen how many can say Amen the Lord do you believe it amen the light of this day Pastor Denzel this is too much man and I want to show you something huh how do you get healed huh how you do you get forgiven I have to read this quotation Hallelujah listen when the man of God is revealing the world are we together and you catch it yes listen it's good to repent it's good to come to the altar it's good to do that but what Hallelujah will cleanse you of your sins is accepting the Revelation if you don't accept the Revelation the little light that you have is taken away do you hear what I'm saying can I read it so I was telling someone I said you do you know that if you catch the revelation of the seventh seal seven Thunders and all those things whatever sin you have it will be cleansed how many listen in the message the identified Christ of all ages so that why I'm talking about the light of this age so listen the reason why we say we are walking in the light it's not that we are gathered here but we C the message of our day how many can say Amen then we are moving in the what in the light that's the difference between us and the world there because we see the manifestation of the word which was promised for our day that's why we are saying we are walking in the what in the light amen how many can say amen and that light it cleanses your sins and those who reject the light hallelujah what happens to them the little light that they have is taken away from them listen now Pastor Adrian 64401 the identified Christ of all ages listen he look at Jesus Oh that we know he was the Manifest word of God we believe that the Bible said it was well watch when he done his messic sign so when he did it to the predestinated say sir I perceive you are the Messiah what did he do to him and when the same was done to the Pharisees rosis they said your B above it condemned them listen now listen the Pharisees that had a little bit of life there was good people lived good Christian Life or a good religious life so if you dress well live right and do everything right there is a little light that comes H because of just living right that's what the Pharisees had a little light because of a religious life a good Christian Life had a little light about them they had organized and a priesthood they had a little light but down in the bottom of their heart they no Eternal representation in glory so when listen when they seen that Supernatural Pastor they said this man is b a devil listen now what happened that put what light they had out so this is a dangerous hour where we are living when people reject the revealed word reject the second coming reject the word the light of this day it puts out the little light that they have that's a dangerous thing but there was a little infed woman the opposite is also true a prostitute down in her heart well she had a representation of one of God's thoughts there she was wicked in sin but when she seen that happen she said say I believe you are a prophet I know when the Messiah cometh he will tell us these things what did it do Brother P says it cleansed her life so what cleanses is not evangelism what cleanses is catching the revealed the light of your day if you catch it it cleanses your life amen what did do Pastor es it cleansed her life Pastor adri these things that you are preaching this divinely revealed mystery truths it's cleansing the bride so if we don't preach these things how will the church be cleansed church can you say amen that's the issue friends so you must appreciate these deep messages you must appreciate the Revelation because revelation cleanses and rejecting the Revelation puts away the little light that you have so we can preach another indictment our indictment brother Bram indicted the people of his day but we when we Reve the word of our day and say who is this Mighty God before that and people say nonsense Hallelujah then it puts away the little light of the long dresses of the shalom shalom it puts out how many can say Amen can I read my last scripture which I believe will be a blessing to someone let's go to Genesis chapter 45 hallelujah amen Genesis 45 I'll just read this and call my pastor how many are been blessed how many are enjoying how many are going to mix this with their faith how many are going to mix this with their faith you know as I as I preach like this because the preaching of the word is the casting out of demons and you are receiving your desires Hallelujah we are in the days of remote controls how many can say Amen we're in an astronaut age and you know sometimes you might think nothing happened brother great things they happen in silence how many can say Amen you are going to call me you are going to tell the pastor that day when the word was preached something happened the cancer disappeared we talking about the manifestation you know of the word the word must become flesh so whatever condition you are in whether you are sick whether whatever it is we want to see the manifestation today am amen Genesis 45 I know it blessed my soul when I read this you know when Joseph was in Egypt you know that Joseph his father Jacob he thought he was dead you remember his brothers came with a blood with a jacket mingled it with blood they said this is your the son's jacket and he said oh surely my my my son has been devoured by beasts and everything and Jacob cried how many can say Amen but Joseph was alive in Egypt he was not dead how many can say Amen to move what elements watch now I just go straight to that so now when he became right men of pharaoh when he became great and you know the story they came to Egypt and he recognized his brothers but they could not recognize him and you know the dramas can I drop this it's just coming fresh listen Joseph H he took the silver cup of the youngest of Benjamin hey sorry his silver cup his treasure he put it in the s in the Bank of what of Benjamin listen now and then he said to his people these people are spies follow them they stole my word and then he says the one that we will find with the cup we are taking him and you you go and Judah knew he had said I'm going to be responsible for Benjamin remember Jacob said Simeon is not Joseph is not now you want to take Benjamin all these things are against me if Benjamin doesn't come you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the Grave so it was like Joseph was hearing the conversation say and then he takes the what the silver cup to he put it to Benjamin his real brother watch now there was a countdown when they say stop you guys spise your thieves the countdown began because the countdown is always from 10 9 8 until Z so listen to what they did they started with the eldest the countdown started with what the eldest Reuben they cuted nothing happened there was no silver cup they went to Simeon they went to Judah brother es until they reach to the youngest how many say they cut the bag then they saw ah the silver cup the treasure the one that he was using to drink tea so even in our age how many can say Amen there was Treasure that was looked after people were looking after these things the the seals the thir P everything and they started the countdown they started with Paul and Paul says I know in part I prophesy in part how many they could find the treasure of the thir po of the seven even Daniel he said when shall these things be he says go thy way for these things for the end time the cles of old they were waiting they wanted to know what is the Thunders what is the seals what is this so they started the countdown from the the eldest poor there was no seven seal how many say no PO they went to irus nothing Hallelujah they went to Columba nothing Martin Luther nothing John Wesley nothing Hallelujah it was just Tong and prophecies nothing they were looking for Jesus looking for the coming of the Lord how looking for the raled way how many can say amen and when they came to William Bram the youngest how many can say Amen they found the seventh SE they found the seven ther they found the thir po so don't be surprised when you see young ministers Hallelujah preaching these things the silver cup might be with the young ministers am the Revelation the Elder shall save the young how many can say Amen even David was the youngest from alab huh even the elder brother a certain men who had two sons the elder brother you know could not get the Revelation but the young brother I preached he was you because the Bible says the father divided unto them he living all of them the Elder was given also but he was just waiting to be given what he was given already and the young brother came again for some more and took that fed cough while the Elder was there and then there was a party there was a drama he refused to come to the party and he did not know what was happening in his father's house yet he was the son the Bible says the elder brother was busy in the field alone yet servants were rejoicing and dancing and eating briani yet the elder brother did not know what's going on and then when he heard some noise he called one of the servant what's going on inside he says no don't dist you know if the Serv know that you don't know what you're doing he will treat you says no don't disturb me can you imagine and then he says no I'm not coming in the father said what's going on they said the father came said you why come in let's enjoy he says no me I've been here with you all these years and you did not even give me a kid a god but this your brother your son he has divided everything with prostitute now you are giving him some more and what is our father listen to what the father say says my son I'm always with you all that I have is thy he reminded him said I gave you I divided so God has already given you heing whatever you want so claim it just take it how many can say Amen don't be like the brother tell your neighbor and say don't be like the elder brother how many can say am so listen to this he says this as I close God bless you church so Joseph now he sends his father with wons with everything he sends his brothers to go and collect his what his father but his father thought he is what he was dead let's start from verse 25 he says and they went up out of Egypt I want you to see something and come into the land sorry I'm just closing maybe 2 minutes into the land of Canaan unto Jacob his father they've arrived now the Bible says they came with wagons of Egypt listen and told him so they packed the what the wagons and the good things of Egypt outside and they went to the bedroom of his father and told him saying Jacob is alive is yet alive and he is Governor over all the land of Egypt and Jacob's heart fainted for he believed them not let K it but the spirit gives life he did not believe them why because the word did not come in word only but in demonstration watch now hey this is serious now listen verse 27 and they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said unto them and when listen now when Jacob saw the wons which Joseph had sent to carry amen the spirit of Jacob their father revived amen what revived him what brings a Revival when the world is made flesh when the listen how I'm talking about the evidence of the Resurrection how many can say if Jesus is Alive where are the wons what are the that's why your neighbors your father your relatives they don't believe this message because you just talk brother did this in res brother went to De he did this he went to Switzerland you are just talking without the evidence without the wons so Jo listen so his children when they said Father Joseph is alive Hallelujah so when he never saw anything he fainted for the letter kill but they open the window and say father look amen and the Bible says when Jacob saw the wons Hallelujah which Joseph had sent to carry him his Spirit was revived what did he say and Israel said it is enough Joseph my son is yet alive I will go and see him before I die so Jacob believed that Joseph was alive before he saw him but what was those wons the evidence of the Resurrection so even the people before they see the Lord Jesus Christ when they see Hallelujah you healed of cancer those are the W Gods when we see Pastor Denzel's Hallelujah he and healed and everything his relatives will say it is enough hey Jesus is how can say Amen so I want to see the here today we want to see the of Joseph hallelu if Joseph is alive where is wles hallelujah where is Miracles where is the god of Elijah how many say am tell your neighbor and say come on I want to see the how many can say Amen what made Joseph Jacob to believe he saw th God b h he says it's enough
