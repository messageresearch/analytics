[3:56] promise we have amen that where the
[3:59] carcass is
[4:00] there the Eagles will be gathered amen
[4:03] hallelujah praise the Lord so amen let's
[4:06] turn to our
[4:15] Bibles amen maybe a little thought
[4:18] Hallelujah just to encourage us that God
[4:21] still has anointed David's amen amen God
[4:26] still has anointed Davids in this hour
[4:29] Hallelujah ujah praise the Lord yes amen
[4:31] you believe that amen amen let's turn to
[4:34] acts 13 and verse
[4:36] 22 read from there amen praise the
[4:50] Lord so the scripture is going to talk
[4:53] about how God removed Saul so he says
[4:56] and when he had removed him he raised up
[4:59] unto them David to be their King Amen to
[5:04] whom also he gave
[5:06] testimony and said now this is God
[5:09] giving testimony the same God that gave
[5:11] testimony over Enoch that he had a
[5:14] testimony that he pleased God I have
[5:18] found David the son of Jesse a man after
[5:21] my own
[5:23] art who shall fulfill all my will amen
[5:28] that's St John 5 19 now the son can do
[5:30] nothing but what he seeth the father do
[5:33] that doth the son likewise that's the
[5:36] place of rest that's the the hidden
[5:39] place we're talking about now right
[5:41] remember we to be a man after God's Own
[5:43] Heart means you must be after his
[5:45] likeness amen so we're dealing with
[5:47] after his likeness these thoughts are
[5:48] coming out of here amen praise the Lord
[5:51] then we can go to Hallelujah praise the
[5:54] Lord just want to find my verse here 2
[5:57] Corinthians 10:4
[5:58] [Applause]
[6:10] from verse three though we walk in the
[6:13] flesh we do not war after the
[6:17] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[6:19] not carnal But Mighty through God to the
[6:22] pulling down of
[6:24] strongholds amen this is a powerful
[6:27] church amen the army of Jesus Christ is
[6:29] a powerful church because though it
[6:31] looks like we're walking in the flesh we
[6:33] are not Waring after the flesh we are
[6:35] pulling down
[6:36] strongholds amen hallelujah casting down
[6:40] imaginations and every High thing that
[6:44] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[6:46] God and bringing into captivity every
[6:49] thought to The Obedience of Christ amen
[6:52] so when your thoughts are going all over
[6:53] you're catching it and you're bringing
[6:54] it in obedience amen you're bringing
[6:56] your thoughts
[6:58] captive praise the Lord
[7:00] to The Obedience of Christ and having in
[7:02] a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[7:05] when your dis when your obedience is
[7:08] fulfilled
[7:10] Hallelujah do you look on things after
[7:13] the outward appearance so the same thing
[7:15] they did to David now they looked at the
[7:17] outp
[7:18] appearance
[7:20] right if any man trust to himself that
[7:22] he is Christ let him of let him of
[7:26] himself think this again that that as he
[7:30] is Christ even so are we Christ for
[7:33] though I should boast somewhat more of
[7:35] our Authority which the Lord had given
[7:38] us for edification and not for your
[7:40] destruction I should not be ashamed amen
[7:43] the Lord had blessings to the reading of
[7:44] his word you may be seated praise the
[7:51] Lord amen just want to read one more
[7:53] portion of scripture here
[8:00] Genesis 1: 126 says God said let us make
[8:03] man in our image after our likeness and
[8:07] let them have dominion over the fish of
[8:09] the sea over the fowl of the air over
[8:11] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[8:15] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[8:16] upon the Earth why I'm reading that now
[8:19] is because you'll see now why I'm
[8:20] reading that man was given dominion over
[8:22] all of these things so these things
[8:24] can't have dominion over
[8:26] man Hallelujah
[8:30] so God created man in his own image in
[8:32] the image of God created he him male and
[8:34] female created he them all right amen so
[8:39] man was given dominion over these things
[8:43] hallelujah praise the Lord so we'll go
[8:45] to 1 Samuel and just for a point of
[8:47] reference we'll pick up the story line
[8:50] praise the
[8:51] [Music]
[8:54] lord we can go to First Samuel 16 and
[8:57] you can reference as we go along from
[8:59] verse 10 there we find here that Saul
[9:03] was raised up as
[9:05] king over Israel now we know there's a
[9:08] natural Israel and there's a spiritual
[9:10] Israel amen so we're not speaking a
[9:13] story line just based Amen to get
[9:16] excited over something we are looking at
[9:18] spiritual Israel how God raised an
[9:22] anointed king called Saul but because of
[9:25] his
[9:26] Disobedience God told him and if you
[9:28] watch the of of Saul he really wanted to
[9:31] repent but he could find no place of
[9:35] repentance God refused and the Bible
[9:37] says that he repented that he he made
[9:39] Saul
[9:40] King because he refused to kill this
[9:45] King and all of the subjects and all of
[9:48] the cattle God had said kill everything
[9:50] so we can't bring anything from the
[9:52] world into spiritual Israel amen God
[9:55] says kill it
[9:57] all praise the Lord amen
[10:02] so from verse 10 here now that God is
[10:04] coming to look for a new
[10:06] king amen God is coming to look for a
[10:10] new king and I'm saying that God still
[10:12] has anointed
[10:14] David's amen now remember David was not
[10:18] one of the popular people he was on the
[10:21] back side of the desert watching over
[10:23] his father sheep so he's not one of
[10:26] prominence he was not one amen of great
[10:28] people didn't respect him well he was
[10:30] just an ordinary Shepherd but here in
[10:33] verse 10 you'll find again Jesse made
[10:35] Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel
[10:38] and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord had
[10:40] not chosen these so seven Church ages
[10:43] has passed by but the Lord had not
[10:45] chosen these to be an end time people to
[10:48] be here to finish the
[10:50] thing thing is a
[10:52] mystery amen hallelujah amen amen so if
[10:57] seven sons pass by who is David
[10:59] oh
[11:00] yes what number is he but eight is going
[11:04] back to
[11:05] the to the
[11:08] beginning the eighth day is going back
[11:10] to the first day you know brother
[11:11] Brandon teaches us these things so if
[11:14] this man is the E he's going to be back
[11:16] in the image again amen he's going to be
[11:20] able to have dominion over the Beast of
[11:22] the field
[11:24] amen
[11:25] hallelujah he's going to have dominion
[11:27] over lions and he's going to have
[11:30] dominion over bears oh yes Hallelujah
[11:34] you see what I'm talking about now if
[11:36] he's the eight he must be like one in
[11:38] the beginning and he must have dominion
[11:41] amen even though they are wild animals
[11:43] now he still has dominion over them and
[11:46] if you notice the Bible doesn't describe
[11:48] David as being a strong and a mighty
[11:52] warrior the Bible calls him of
[11:54] readyy readyy countenance amen amen
[11:58] hallelujah so let's continue to read the
[12:00] Lord had chosen none of these and Samuel
[12:03] said unto Jesse I hear all thy children
[12:07] and he said they remain it yet the
[12:09] youngest amen and behold he keepeth the
[12:12] sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send
[12:15] and fetch him for we will not sit down
[12:17] till he come
[12:19] either I'm telling you that all creation
[12:22] is groaning as well
[12:24] yes and they are saying we will not stop
[12:27] our groan until they come
[12:30] amen we are looking for the
[12:32] manifestation of the sons of God yes
[12:34] amen and they will not keep quiet yeah
[12:38] amen you can keep the church World quiet
[12:40] you can keep people quiet from their
[12:42] prayers but one thing all creation will
[12:44] not stop
[12:46] groaning they groan daily amen they are
[12:49] groaning for the manifestation of the
[12:51] sons of God am praise the Lord amen so
[12:55] he says we will not sit down till he
[12:57] come either and he sent and brought him
[13:00] now he was ready with all of a beautiful
[13:03] countenance and goodly to look to and
[13:06] the Lord said arise anoint him for this
[13:10] is
[13:11] he amen so the same way God has chosen
[13:14] us specifically said this is him amen
[13:18] this is her amen this is the one I can
[13:21] use oh yes Hallelujah now notice God is
[13:26] working on both ends
[13:29] God always works on both
[13:31] ends there's a king that's being
[13:33] rejected and God wants to replace him so
[13:37] can I say that there's an anointed one
[13:39] that's being rejected and God's going to
[13:41] replace him with another anointed
[13:46] one praise the
[13:48] Lord then Samuel took the on of oil and
[13:51] we know the oil typing the Holy Spirit
[13:53] and anointed him in the midst of his
[13:55] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[13:57] Upon David from that day forward so
[14:00] Samuel rose up and went to
[14:03] Rama but the spirit of the Lord departed
[14:05] from
[14:08] Saul amen and an evil spirit from the
[14:11] Lord troubled
[14:14] him and Saul's servant said unto him
[14:17] behold now an evil spirit from God
[14:19] troubleth thee let our Lord Now command
[14:22] thy servants which are before thee to
[14:24] seek out a man now how do they know that
[14:28] m music can drive out demon
[14:30] [Music]
[14:33] powers let's seek a man who is a cunning
[14:35] player of on an up and it shall come to
[14:38] pass when the evil spirit from God is
[14:41] upon thee that he shall play with his
[14:44] hand and thou shalt be
[14:47] well you see because the weapons of our
[14:50] Warfare are not
[14:54] carnal they know that Earth is
[14:57] influenced by spiritual for forces amen
[15:00] and we have got to realize that as well
[15:02] in our lives things are just not
[15:04] ordinary in the natural amen like we
[15:07] think sometimes there's always a spirit
[15:10] attached to it it's either the spirit of
[15:12] God or it's a spirit an evil spirit yes
[15:15] can you see it here in the scripture
[15:17] amen amen it might look from the
[15:19] ordinary that Saul was being vexed in
[15:21] his spirit and now he was troubled
[15:24] because the kingdom was going to be
[15:25] taken away from him that you'll think
[15:27] he's going into depression but here the
[15:29] Bible is revealing that it's a
[15:32] spirit that vexed
[15:35] him
[15:36] amen so here David is a man now remember
[15:41] you don't have to
[15:42] operate as a son only because somebody
[15:46] gave you a
[15:48] title I'll break it down
[15:51] further David was already operating as a
[15:55] priest amen because a priest as our
[15:57] Prophet teaches us he's one who gives
[16:00] praise to the Lord amen the fruits of
[16:02] your lips giving praise to God
[16:04] Amen so I I'm about to show you the
[16:07] image now here's a man who is giving
[16:11] praise to God meaning he's fulfilling
[16:13] the role of a priest and he is going to
[16:16] be the anointed king so he is both
[16:18] priest and
[16:20] King which is the image of God
[16:23] amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[16:27] amen
[16:29] so when somebody is in the image of God
[16:31] nothing shall be able to stand before
[16:33] thee all the days of thy
[16:35] life I am challenging you this evening
[16:38] and bringing this message to tell you
[16:40] that you are being molded and shaped
[16:42] into the image of Jesus Christ amen you
[16:45] are both priest and King but you have to
[16:47] come into your Authority now nothing
[16:49] shall be able to stand before you amen
[16:52] amen am
[16:56] Hallelujah so there he says provide me a
[16:59] man that when the evil spirit from God
[17:01] is upon thee that he shall play with his
[17:03] hand and thou shalt be well and Saul
[17:06] said unto his servants provide me now a
[17:08] man that can play well and bring him to
[17:12] me then answered one of his servants and
[17:15] said behold I've seen a son of Jesse the
[17:18] bethlehemite that is cunning and playing
[17:21] might Mighty Valiant man and a man of
[17:24] war
[17:29] but David was tending sheep he was not
[17:31] in Battle
[17:33] Before amen but they call him a man of
[17:37] war we're making wars in the
[17:42] heavenlies
[17:44] Hallelujah I put it to you this way
[17:46] brother Joshua that this was not the
[17:49] first time David played and Demon
[17:51] Spirits
[17:54] fled that's why they called him
[17:59] they had seen the power of His
[18:01] playing that when this man played music
[18:04] demon powers left bodies amen you see
[18:08] how important the music is amen amen
[18:10] that's why there's a half an hour music
[18:12] before the service therefore the singers
[18:15] and the musicians have to be anointed
[18:17] that when they are playing amen and
[18:19] before they come to service there ought
[18:21] to be a preparation there ought to be a
[18:22] prayer Lord even as I play today I pray
[18:25] that demon spirits will leave amen l if
[18:29] anyone's coming there downhearted
[18:30] depressed I pray the spirit of God Amen
[18:34] the music will flow and the spirit of
[18:36] God will bring Deliverance to them even
[18:38] before the preacher comes
[18:41] yes
[18:43] Hallelujah so he's a mighty Valiant man
[18:46] and a man of war and prudent in matters
[18:49] and a comely person and the Lord is with
[18:54] him Hallelujah wherefore Saul sent
[18:57] Messengers unto Jesse say send me David
[18:59] thy son which is with the
[19:01] sheep and Jesse took an ass Laden with
[19:04] bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and
[19:07] sent them by David his son unto Saul you
[19:11] see when you read in the Bible there
[19:13] you'll see even when they were going to
[19:15] Salt uh sorry to Samuel they always took
[19:18] something to give the man of
[19:21] God because they recognize the anointing
[19:24] Upon A man I'm just trying to show you
[19:26] why they were doing this yeah amen
[19:29] they didn't just go empty-handed when
[19:30] Saul goes to Samuel the first time to
[19:33] speak to him he also he's troubled and
[19:37] he ask his the man that's next to him
[19:39] but we have nothing to give the man of
[19:42] God and then the man of God says I have
[19:45] some silver here we can give him this
[19:48] amen am hallelujah amen so he's saying
[19:51] here we're going now to Saul so he's
[19:53] also giving him wine and a kid and he
[19:56] sent him unto Saul and David came came
[19:58] to Saul and stood before him and he
[20:00] loved him greatly and he became his
[20:02] armor
[20:04] Bearer and Saul said to Jesse let David
[20:08] I pray thee stand before me for he had
[20:10] found favor in my sight and it came to
[20:13] pass when the evil spirit from God was
[20:15] upon Saul that David took an up and
[20:18] played with his hand so Saul was
[20:20] refreshed and was well and the evil
[20:23] spirit departed from him
[20:26] amen amen if you don't have a musician
[20:29] to play for you live put on some good
[20:32] gospel
[20:33] music amen
[20:37] hallelujah praise the
[20:39] Lord or maybe I don't know if these
[20:41] brothers are willing maybe you call them
[20:42] and say brother I'm troubled in my
[20:44] spirit why don't you bring your
[20:46] instrument and come play music for
[20:48] me amen praise the
[20:52] Lord so then that brings us now to
[20:55] chapter 17 an anointed
[20:59] there's a man who's anointed for the
[21:00] position of
[21:04] King amen but God is also showing you
[21:08] that this man is not operating in the
[21:09] spir in the natural
[21:11] realm this man is operating in the king
[21:15] Kingdom realm in the spiritual
[21:17] realm he understands about spiritual
[21:20] warfare therefore we read there the
[21:23] weapons of our Warfare are not
[21:27] carnal so we find ourselves that there's
[21:30] a king now who is losing his position
[21:33] and his authority within his kingdom and
[21:35] the fullest time armies are coming
[21:37] against
[21:39] him because Satan can only work through
[21:41] doubt and
[21:43] reasoning
[21:45] amen Satan can only work when there's
[21:47] doubt and reasoning and now we find if
[21:50] you can put it this way that the guide
[21:52] that left
[21:53] Saul and when the guide leaves Saul when
[21:56] the guide leaves that brings room for
[21:58] the enemy to come
[22:00] in amen when the guide left in the
[22:03] Garden of
[22:04] Eden Adam left and he went to work what
[22:08] happened the enemy came
[22:10] in
[22:13] Hallelujah and Saul said uh this is
[22:16] verse two now and Saul and the men of
[22:18] Israel gathered together and pitched by
[22:20] the valley of ela and set the battle in
[22:22] Array against the Philistines and the
[22:24] Philistines stood on a mountain on one
[22:26] side and Israel stood on a mountain on
[22:28] the other side and there was a valley
[22:30] between
[22:31] them I wonder if this is why David wrote
[22:34] in the psalm though I walk to the
[22:36] [Music]
[22:38] valley
[22:40] amen
[22:42] hallelujah of the shadow of death I will
[22:45] fear no evil amen amen praise the Lord
[22:49] yes because it was in the valley is
[22:52] where the battle was yes gol was waiting
[22:55] there Hallelujah
[23:00] and they went out a champion out of the
[23:01] camp of the Philistines named Goliath
[23:03] whose I was six cubits and a span you
[23:05] see these people like
[23:11] slangs hey for those of you who caught
[23:15] it
[23:17] amen his height was six cubits and a
[23:20] span and he had a helmet of brass upon
[23:22] his head and he's armed with a coat of
[23:25] maale and the weight of his coat was
[23:27] 5,000 shekels of brass and he had
[23:30] Greaves of brass upon his legs and BR a
[23:32] target of brass between his shoulders if
[23:35] this man only knew that brass
[23:36] represented
[23:37] [Music]
[23:40] judgment amen praise the
[23:42] Lord and he so he had it upon his legs
[23:48] between his shoulders amen but I want
[23:50] you to why I'm reading that I want you
[23:52] to know David wasn't equipped this way
[23:54] yes David had the elet of salvation
[23:58] he had the breastplate of righteousness
[24:01] his loins was GED with truth his feet
[24:03] were short with the preparation of the
[24:05] gospel and he had the sword of the
[24:06] spirit but these were not weapons that
[24:08] you could see with your natural
[24:10] eye because the breastplate of
[24:13] righteousness is not a natural thing
[24:14] that you can see with your eye neither
[24:16] is the armor of salvation but every
[24:18] believer is equipped with a armor
[24:21] amen praise the Lord
[24:30] verse eight and he stood and cried now
[24:33] watch let's just read this verse and he
[24:36] stood and Cried unto the armies of
[24:38] Israel and said unto them why are you
[24:40] come out to set your battle in Array am
[24:43] not I a Philistine and he servants to
[24:47] Saul choose he a man for you and let him
[24:50] come down to me if he be able to fight
[24:53] with me and to kill me that we will be
[24:56] your servants but if I Prevail against
[24:59] him and kill him then shall he be our
[25:02] servants and serve
[25:06] us these were the people that God
[25:08] brought out of
[25:10] Egypt these were God's people to take
[25:13] them captive Satan okay do you know that
[25:17] Satan is now in this
[25:19] Army that these people are demon
[25:22] possessed you know how the Bible decs
[25:25] that Satan was in that King
[25:30] amen the king of T was it the king of
[25:33] T praise the Lord how many if you know
[25:36] what I'm talking
[25:38] about that Satan can become incarnate in
[25:40] people amen and demon powers can possess
[25:43] an army praise the
[25:47] Lord so I'm trying to show you that
[25:49] these are Supernatural forces coming now
[25:51] upon the Earth amen but we are not
[25:54] fighting against flesh and blood you've
[25:56] got to recognize the spirit behind it
[25:58] right amen praise the
[26:02] Lord if he be able to F so we read that
[26:05] verse 10 and the Philistines said I defy
[26:07] the armies of Israel this day give me a
[26:11] man that we may fight together when Saul
[26:13] and all of Israel heard those words of
[26:15] the Philistine they were dismayed and
[26:18] greatly
[26:20] afraid now here's the scene in the
[26:23] Israel
[26:24] Camp he has a scene they are standing on
[26:27] the mountain they're looking down on the
[26:29] valley at Goliath screaming at
[26:33] them now the Bible also records in priet
[26:36] chapters that the man that's supposed to
[26:38] Face Goliath was Saul because the Bible
[26:41] records Saul as being Head and Shoulders
[26:42] above all the children of
[26:46] Israel but the Bible says when Saul and
[26:49] Israel heard those words of the
[26:51] Philistine they were dismayed and
[26:53] greatly
[26:56] afraid so when they fear there there's
[26:59] no faith now I want you watch how God
[27:02] changes a scene because God works on
[27:04] both ends amen what did what did Goliath
[27:07] just make a call for give me a man and
[27:11] when Israel can't provide a man God is
[27:14] going to provide a man amen yes amen
[27:18] hallelujah yes when all creation is
[27:20] groaning for the manifestation of the
[27:22] sons of God and the church world can
[27:24] produce the manifested sons of God God
[27:27] is going to provide the man amen yes yes
[27:32] Hallelujah church are you ready to be
[27:34] called amen are you ready for battle
[27:37] amen God has called you for this time
[27:39] and season amen praise the
[27:42] Lord
[27:44] amen now from verse 12 he takes you now
[27:50] to Bethlehem Juda because God wants to
[27:54] rec wants you to remember that the lon
[27:57] is coming from Judah yes amen he's
[28:00] coming from the tribe of Judah the
[28:02] scepter shall not depart from Judah
[28:05] amen so verse 12 changes the scene
[28:08] because God is working on both ends here
[28:10] they are on the
[28:11] battlefield and these people are
[28:13] civilian life maybe thousands of miles
[28:16] away but God is going to answer on both
[28:18] ends yes Hallelujah so Jessi yeah the
[28:23] Bible confirms whose name was Jesse and
[28:24] he had eight Sons so we know the eighth
[28:26] son who he is and we told you the son
[28:28] must go back to the beginning amen and
[28:30] the man went among men for an old man in
[28:34] the days of
[28:36] Saul amen so I don't want to read all of
[28:38] that amen you can go read it for
[28:41] yourself so I want you want to read this
[28:44] verse 17 and Jesse said unto David his
[28:46] son take now for thy Brethren and EPA of
[28:50] this parched corn and these 10
[28:54] Loaves and run to the camp to thy
[28:57] brethren

[29:03] captain of their
[29:04] thousand and
[29:06] look how thy Brethren fare and take
[29:09] their pledge hallelujah praise the Lord
[29:13] now if you read there that's to do with
[29:17] eating right how many of you can see

[29:48] the Lord that's just a type there amen
[29:49] praise the Lord let's just move on very

[30:00] unusual way God coming in an unexpected

[31:13] Keeper of the carriage and ran to the

[31:20] Brethren amen what did the Bible just
[31:23] say these men were fearful and these men
[31:26] were afraid but yes the joy of the Lord

[44:01] staff watch out David is approaching the
[44:03] battle yes he's not relying on
[44:06] weapons the the weapons of our Warfare
[44:09] not carnal he's not relying his strength
[44:12] and his hope is not in that
[44:15] slingshot he knows that this is just an
[44:17] ordinary
[44:18] slingshot he knows it's not possible
[44:21] humanly possible for him to defeat goath
[44:24] like on a natural basis he knows what am
[44:27] I trying to say that he must have
[44:29] Supernatural assistance yes amen
