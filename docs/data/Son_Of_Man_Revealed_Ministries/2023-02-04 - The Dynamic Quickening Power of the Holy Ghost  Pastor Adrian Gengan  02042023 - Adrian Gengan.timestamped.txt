[7:51] morning we'll speak on the quickening
[7:53] dynamic power of the Holy Ghost amen
[7:56] this will be my Easter message saying
[7:58] that they will not give me an
[7:59] opportunity to preach at the convention
[8:01] this morning will be my Easter message
[8:03] the quickening dynamic power of the Holy
[8:06] Ghost amen let's turn to John Chapter 2
[8:09] and verse 19.
[8:12] Hallelujah
[8:15] John chapter 2 verse 19.
[8:19] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[8:21] destroy this Temple
[8:24] and in three days I will raise it up
[8:28] amen
[8:30] I personal pronoun will raise it up
[8:35] those were not ordinary words
[8:38] how many of you can make that statement
[8:39] destroy this Temple and in three days
[8:41] I'll raise it up
[8:42] so there to be something special about
[8:44] Jesus to make such a boast amen let's
[8:48] turn to Revelation chapter 1 verse 17.
[8:52] the Apostle John is
[8:55] seeing Jesus
[8:57] in heaven
[8:58] and he says and when I saw him so that's
[9:01] Revelation 1 verse 17 and when I saw him
[9:05] I fell at his feet as dead now he walked
[9:08] to Jesus for three years
[9:10] he didn't feel that way
[9:14] but he sees him in heaven and he says I
[9:16] fell at his feet as dead
[9:17] and he laid his right hand upon me
[9:19] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[9:23] and the last
[9:26] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[9:30] behold I Am Alive forevermore
[9:33] amen
[9:35] so you see amen is scriptural
[9:37] you see even in the Bible they wrote
[9:39] amen
[9:41] so you're allowed to say amen amen I Am
[9:44] Alive forevermore amen
[9:47] and have the keys of hell and of death
[9:50] amen one more proportion of scripture in
[9:52] Romans chapter 8 verse 11.
[10:00] Romans chapter 8 verse 11 very familiar
[10:03] portion of scripture
[10:04] it's the one we can go down to the Grave
[10:06] with
[10:07] because of the quickening power that
[10:09] lays in the Scripture it says but if the
[10:12] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[10:15] the dead dwell in you
[10:18] is a Spirit dwelling in you he that
[10:21] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[10:23] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[10:26] spirit that dwelleth in you amen may the
[10:30] Lord the blessings to the reading of his
[10:32] word you may be seated
[10:34] amen
[10:36] the chain and if you can pull up the
[10:37] message it is the rising of the Sun and
[10:40] I'll give you the different paragraphs
[10:41] as we go through it in Memphis
[10:43] we'll just be touching that one sermon
[10:45] this morning amen hallelujah
[10:48] so the dynamic quickening power of the
[10:50] Holy Spirit
[10:51] amen
[10:53] we just read where our lord Jesus made a
[10:56] boast
[10:58] that you destroyed this Temple and in
[11:00] three days I will raise it up
[11:02] amen now there's many men on the earth
[11:04] that may have suffered may have died may
[11:06] have given their lives you know many men
[11:08] we even have men in our country that
[11:11] were sacrificial with their lives
[11:14] amen
[11:15] look at our ex-president Nelson Mandela
[11:18] they suffered and they gave their lives
[11:20] for real good causes but there was never
[11:23] one that could raise himself again like
[11:25] our lord Jesus did two thousand years
[11:27] ago
[11:28] amen nobody
[11:32] amen even you can't raise yourself up
[11:35] we've got to rely on the dynamic
[11:37] quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[11:40] if we go to the Grave without the Holy
[11:42] Ghost there's no Resurrection for us
[11:45] amen
[11:46] so this we know is the greatest week in
[11:49] all of history
[11:51] amen the greatest celebration of all
[11:53] times is to prove where what he said
[11:56] came to pass because any man can make a
[11:59] boast but he is to prove what he said
[12:01] when he said destroy this Temple and in
[12:04] three days I'm gonna raise it up again
[12:07] amen
[12:09] so that word we know that
[12:13] I'm alive or quick and the word Quicken
[12:15] means made alive after death
[12:19] amen to be made alive after death and
[12:22] this morning you and I sit in the
[12:24] presence of God as benefactors of the
[12:26] Resurrection
[12:28] amen if Jesus didn't rise again you and
[12:31] I would go to the Grave with no hope
[12:32] amen
[12:34] amen the end of this life would be that
[12:36] just there at the End
[12:38] Amen but we find for the believer amen
[12:42] it's not the end it's just the beginning
[12:44] it may be the end of this Temple pistols
[12:48] amen but we go into glorious Realm of
[12:51] the sixth Dimension we go into our fear
[12:54] of any body we experience another Rhythm
[12:57] people don't know of this but the
[12:59] prophet says Dynamic power struck him in
[13:01] the room one day and took him beyond the
[13:03] curtain of time
[13:05] amen
[13:08] nobody else on the face of the Earth has
[13:10] this revelation that we're going to tear
[13:12] off in your body a young body a body
[13:15] that doesn't eat that doesn't sleep
[13:17] amen amen
[13:20] Hallelujah so we find here amen like the
[13:24] prophet he's saying how how are we going
[13:26] to be quickened
[13:28] he says like the first day when the Lord
[13:30] says let there be light and that light
[13:33] struck the Earth
[13:35] and brother Branham says that when he
[13:37] said let there be he says there were
[13:39] seeds laying in the Earth
[13:41] but he needed the sunlight to strike the
[13:44] seed
[13:45] amen hallelujah what did it that Dynamic
[13:49] power
[13:50] and to strike the seed
[13:52] and he says there was light and it amen
[13:55] everything that covered the waters amen
[13:57] even though it covered the waters it was
[13:59] laying there dark dismal gloomy
[14:01] atmosphere but the spirit of God moved
[14:03] upon the face of the waters
[14:05] amen
[14:07] and God had a reason to do that for
[14:09] beneath and Waters we said was seed amen
[14:12] hallelujah and he says in this time when
[14:14] the Glorious light of the message of the
[14:17] owl begins to strike the Earth
[14:19] seeds that are laying in the Earth
[14:21] Sons and Daughters see that's laying
[14:24] within you if you trace back your life
[14:27] at one time you had no Awakening that
[14:29] you were a son and daughter of God you
[14:32] are living your life but one day the
[14:34] dynamic power of the Holy Spirit struck
[14:37] your heart got your attention amen call
[14:41] you to deeper and higher things amen
[14:43] what is it you heard from your theophany
[14:47] amen hallelujah yes amen so that day
[14:52] amen we find amen this that day that
[14:55] first day can you imagine the first
[14:56] sunrise
[14:58] what a glorious thing it must have been
[15:00] when the Lord created the Sun and the
[15:02] Moon
[15:03] and the Lord saw that first Sunrise it
[15:06] must have been a glorious day amen
[15:07] everything was functioning according to
[15:10] its Eden Beauty
[15:11] amen hallelujah
[15:15] and we take this time now we're talking
[15:17] about we want to focus more on the
[15:19] resurrection amen we find that Sunday
[15:23] morning
[15:26] Sunday morning the Believers
[15:29] now let's picture ourselves in the
[15:31] church
[15:33] amen let's picture ourselves in that
[15:35] church for a moment
[15:37] we should never come to Jesus with
[15:39] preconceived ideas
[15:43] that's how these three women were
[15:44] approaching the tomb
[15:46] coming to Jesus
[15:48] with a preconceived idea that he was
[15:50] dead in the Tomb
[15:53] they had forgotten three years of
[15:55] teaching
[15:58] that his very purpose was to lay his
[15:59] life down
[16:01] so they were coming to Jesus based on
[16:04] their own idea based on their own
[16:06] feelings and based on their own
[16:07] ambitions
[16:09] the feeling was gloomy
[16:11] they were still sad
[16:14] in fact they were fearful
[16:18] and at least this woman had some courage
[16:21] to come to the tomb you couldn't find
[16:23] the disciples anywhere
[16:25] they were hiding
[16:27] fearful of their lives
[16:31] amen
[16:32] not expecting the promise because
[16:35] before the our lord Jesus was crucified
[16:38] them he told them he would rise on the
[16:39] third day but the disciples who heard
[16:42] the word didn't understand the word all
[16:44] right yes
[16:45] physically they heard the words coming
[16:47] out of Jesus mouth
[16:49] even the scribes of Pharisees all heard
[16:52] the words and they said
[16:54] we took 40 years to build his Temple
[16:56] what are you talking about so they heard
[16:58] the word
[16:59] hearing the word alone is not good
[17:01] enough
[17:04] you've got to believe the word
[17:06] the word is going to take root in your
[17:08] heart and you've got to wait for the
[17:10] expectation amen and the disciples being
[17:12] under expectation oh they wouldn't have
[17:15] been able to sleep Saturday night
[17:18] there would have been an anticipation
[17:19] they would have camped outside their
[17:21] tomb amen hallelujah
[17:23] waiting for the Glorious resurrection of
[17:26] the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:30] now
[17:31] don't don't look down on them because
[17:33] the Lord has given us a promise of a
[17:35] body change the Lord has given us a
[17:37] promise of a resurrection of the
[17:39] sleeping Saints how are we preparing
[17:42] what's our expectation have we gone into
[17:45] a land and we become fearful
[17:48] have we just become accustomed to latest
[17:51] here and the cares of this life warmers
[17:53] go to work provide for my family come
[17:55] home
[17:56] amen what's our preparation what's our
[17:59] expectation
[18:00] let me tell you one time the dynamic
[18:02] power of the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[18:04] amen that will be your only conviction
[18:06] that will be your only purpose amen
[18:08] preparing for the body change
[18:12] you work your entire life around that
[18:15] amen hallelujah
[18:17] and you don't blame them
[18:20] you don't blame the scribes the
[18:21] Pharisees you don't blame the disciples
[18:24] because they had never seen this kind of
[18:26] a man before
[18:30] this was a God man
[18:32] amen I mean they never heard somebody
[18:34] say I'm gonna put me in the ground I'll
[18:37] Raise Myself up again this was foreign
[18:39] to them
[18:40] they never heard about it before
[18:43] so for them to believe it would have
[18:45] taken perfect Faith but they didn't have
[18:47] perfect Faith at that time they wasn't
[18:49] accustomed to this kind of man they were
[18:52] accustomed to a fallen man
[18:54] they were accustomed to man sinning
[18:56] you're taking a lamb slay it to make an
[18:58] atonement for that man
[19:00] amen they had seen glimpses of the
[19:02] powers with the prophets
[19:04] they had seen glimpses of the power
[19:06] through Moses through Elijah and through
[19:08] all the prophets
[19:10] but they had never seen a man operate in
[19:12] authority of heaven where he could stand
[19:14] and say peace be still he could speak to
[19:16] the winds and the waves and they would
[19:18] obey him
[19:19] a blind man who had no eyeballs amen
[19:22] Jesus spits into the ground takes a bit
[19:25] of mind and he puts it on there and the
[19:27] man I borrow the Creator
[19:30] they've never seen this kind of a man
[19:32] amen hallelujah they brought a dead man
[19:35] before Jesus one time and he raised him
[19:38] back to life again
[19:40] amen and they even testified never a man
[19:44] speak like this man
[19:47] Hallelujah and I want to say his bride
[19:50] has his potentials never a woman speaks
[19:53] like this woman with such Faith with
[19:55] such Authority for such purpose
[19:58] you speak as if you know the Redemption
[20:01] plan of God Amen you speak as if you
[20:04] know it's better amen the thoughts in
[20:06] the back part of his mind
[20:09] amen never a woman speak like this I've
[20:11] seen all seven Church Angels speak amen
[20:14] but never a woman amen speak like this
[20:17] bride of Jesus Christ are you a part of
[20:19] that party this morning give God praise
[20:21] amen
[20:22] [Applause]
[20:24] bring many many men hallelujah amen what
[20:29] was the expectation at that time they
[20:31] were looking for a man to come in on the
[20:33] scene and rescue them and deliver them
[20:36] from the Roman rule that's right they
[20:38] were expecting a similar Exodus to the
[20:40] first
[20:41] like how Moses LED them out of the
[20:43] Egyptian rule they were looking for
[20:45] Jesus to lead them out of the Roman rule
[20:48] amen but this was not the first Exodus
[20:51] this was another time this was another
[20:53] season
[20:55] catch this now
[20:56] God may have called you but you've got
[20:59] to wait for your time and season
[21:01] amen Moses was called he was living in
[21:05] Egypt all the time but when the right
[21:07] time and season came around the dynamic
[21:10] power of the Holy Ghost put that word in
[21:12] his heart and he quickened to that word
[21:17] Joshua and Caleb were there right there
[21:19] in Egypt
[21:20] but they didn't move out of season
[21:22] they didn't move out of time
[21:25] amen they supported Moses all the way
[21:28] amen these were young men these were
[21:30] able men amen sometimes they had to hold
[21:33] up the hands of Moses a weary Prophet a
[21:36] tired Prophet but they knew their
[21:38] Ministry and they subjected themselves
[21:40] under the ministry of Moses but when the

[23:31] just get into the lab tomorrow's Monday
[23:33] and you watch How we'll switch
[23:37] amen hallelujah
[23:40] amen
[23:41] so this Exodus was going to be a
[23:43] spiritual Exodus
[23:45] amen with the price of the Redemption of
[23:48] man fully paid the other Exodus had a
[23:51] temporal lamb but this Exodus would
[23:54] produce the original lamb amen that was
[23:56] slain in the back part of God's mind
[23:59] amen man was going to be filled with the
[24:01] Holy Ghost
[24:03] which would Empower him again and put
[24:05] the supernatural element back into man
[24:09] without the Holy Ghost there's no
[24:10] Supernatural element to us
[24:14] amen
[24:17] I'm going to speak quickly about
[24:18] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[24:21] you know they drew them and those three
[24:23] types amen The Body Soul and Spirit
[24:26] that they threw into the fiery furnace
[24:31] amen
[24:33] but yeah the king testifies I see one
[24:37] who's the man in the furnace
[24:40] amen who's the man in the furnace
[24:43] he says he has the appearance like the
[24:45] son of God
[24:47] amen I want to bring that up now and
[24:50] further their thoughts amen you are made
[24:52] of a body spirit and soul
[24:55] but even science don't know that you
[24:57] have a soul
[24:58] science will not testify that you have a
[25:00] soul
[25:01] amen some of them believe that they have
[25:03] a spirit some don't write me no
[25:05] scientists are confused
[25:07] they'll go as fast as far as much as
[25:09] maybe saying yes you have a body and you
[25:10] have a spirit
[25:12] but most of them go with the mind only
[25:15] that the intellect is in the mind and
[25:17] that's what governs you right but my
[25:19] thought is this you are Body Spirit and
[25:22] soul
[25:22] but there's a supernatural specie on the
[25:25] face of the Earth
[25:27] a very small amount of people
[25:30] that is just not a three-part being
[25:33] amen the man is in you it's the
[25:37] dynamic power of the Holy Ghost there's
[25:39] only one class of people like that and
[25:41] it's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:43] God that have been filled with the power
[25:45] of the Holy Ghost not only do I have
[25:47] Body Spirit and soul but I have the Holy
[25:50] Ghost
[25:54] amen hallelujah amen let's go back to
[25:57] our thought on these disciples now they
[25:59] they were fearful because they saw the
[26:01] Lord whipped
[26:03] Church they whipped our Lord
[26:06] dispatch on him they pulled his beard
[26:08] they slept in and they said prophesy who
[26:12] slept you
[26:14] they took him to a pool they tied him to
[26:16] the pool and they whipped him
[26:19] I don't know if you know how many times
[26:23] amen
[26:25] they whipped him they whipped him till
[26:27] his flesh hung on him
[26:30] they beat him
[26:32] they saw the blood
[26:34] they saw the agony they saw and carried
[26:37] a cross
[26:38] is here
[26:40] so better than beating and Bruce was
[26:43] this lamb that he could barely carry
[26:45] that cross then he stumbled
[26:48] and they had to get a mad Simon to help
[26:51] him Carry the Cross
[26:54] amen
[26:57] they saw the pain and the experience and
[26:59] they saw the humanity of Jesus and they
[27:02] were driven to Despair and helplessness
[27:04] when they saw him die that day
[27:08] on their cross
[27:10] you know when you operate in the natural
[27:14] nobody gave them used the temple
[27:17] something is taking place in the temple
[27:20] this earthquake
[27:23] this darkness in the middle of the day
[27:26] nothing got a hold of them
[27:28] why is there an earthquake why is there
[27:30] darkness in the middle of the day
[27:32] why did the temple veil be torn into
[27:35] from top to bottom
[27:37] nothing triggered within them
[27:40] yet it was transpiring
[27:45] the mercies hit came in plain view
[27:48] something none of them had seen beside
[27:50] the high priest but now anyone who went
[27:52] into the temple could see it
[27:54] why because of the one hanging on the
[27:57] cross
[27:59] amen amen
[28:04] so he said had they believed they would
[28:06] have gone and waited at the Tomb in
[28:09] anticipation on the third day
[28:11] they would have been waiting with a
[28:12] royal robe they would have been waiting
[28:15] with songs of Jubilation and shouts of
[28:17] Joy if you thought the the celebration
[28:20] amen I think today is today Palm Sunday
[28:24] probably right we're not Catholics we
[28:25] don't normally follow those things amen
[28:28] I mean if you're doing Lent
[28:31] just shaking amen
[28:34] if you thought the celebration or Palm
[28:36] leaves or something this would have been
[28:38] a bigger celebration
[28:40] amen you know the prophet says crosses
[28:44] my mind now he says if the Lord told me
[28:46] tomorrow that somebody was going to
[28:48] raise up from the dead he said I would
[28:49] call everyone
[28:50] I would call the news outlets I would
[28:52] call everyone because I have blessed the
[28:54] Lord and I will say that saved the Lord
[28:56] this brother is going to rise up
[28:59] that's what they should have done
[29:03] and they moved by faith
[29:05] but Jesus told Peter you know what
[29:07] you're gonna run like a coward
[29:10] you're gonna run
[29:12] amen
[29:14] you know what they should have known
[29:16] that Jesus keeps all these appointments
[29:21] even in his own death he said you know
[29:24] what I'm going to raise up at this time
[29:26] I should have known this man keeps all
[29:29] his appointments
[29:32] amen Jesus will meet you at your
[29:36] appointment
[29:37] come to him with faith believing
[29:40] come with a heart amen sincere and not
[29:43] only will he meet your condition meet
[29:45] your need you will never be the same
[29:46] again

[29:56] coming with spices to anoint the dead
[29:59] cold body of the Lord Jesus
[30:03] that's what's in their mind right
[30:06] but in reality it's not so
[30:11] week after week

[30:15] dead cold body
[30:19] but that's not the case in reality right

[34:10] amen hallelujah
[34:13] now what what happened that day
[34:18] you'll find here Amen brother you can
[34:21] probably pick it up in let's go to Mark
[34:23] 16 you can put it on the screen reason
[34:25] why I want to get to it is because some
[34:26] younger people need to hear the story
[34:32] amen and it says and when the Sabbath
[34:34] was passed you can put Mark 16 chapter
[34:36] one we all know Mark 16 How It Ends
[34:39] right
[34:39] [Music]
[34:40] these sign shall follow him
[34:42] this is how it starts this is why the
[34:45] science can follow you
[34:47] it's because of what happened here in
[34:48] verse one
[34:49] onwards
[34:51] and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[34:53] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[34:55] and Salome had brought sweet spices that
[34:59] they made come and anoint him
[35:01] and very early in the morning the first
[35:03] day of the week they came unto the
[35:05] Sepulcher at the rising of the Sun
[35:08] right you know the prophet says there
[35:10] was a dual Sunrise that morning
[35:12] the rising of the sun and the rising of
[35:14] the son and they said among themselves
[35:16] who now look at what their thoughts are
[35:19] their thoughts are more on the sweet
[35:21] spices
[35:24] right and who is going to roll away the
[35:26] stone so that we can actually anoint the
[35:28] body
[35:30] who shall roll away shall roll us away
[35:33] the Stone from the door of the Sepulcher
[35:34] and when they looked they saw the stone
[35:37] was rolled away
[35:43] amen
[35:45] for now here the Bible reiterates the
[35:49] stone was very great
[35:53] and entering into the Sepulcher they saw
[35:55] a young man standing on the right side
[35:58] clawed in a long white garment and they
[36:01] were frightened
[36:03] and he said unto them be not a
[36:06] frightened you seek Jesus of Nazareth
[36:09] which was crucified he is risen for he
[36:13] is not here
[36:15] amen behold the place where they laid
[36:18] him
[36:19] [Music]
[36:20] foreign
[36:21] you and I can run through every
[36:23] denomination this morning
[36:25] and make that same statement
[36:27] [Music]
[36:31] you can tell them he is not here
[36:37] you can go to the biggest churches in
[36:38] Durban
[36:39] run there on the platform he is not here
[36:42] he is risen
[36:46] amen hallelujah
[36:50] but go your way tell his disciples and
[36:54] Peter that he goeth before you into
[36:56] Galilee there shall you see him and he's
[36:59] as he said unto you
[37:01] amen what did he say as he said unto you
[37:06] remember what he said
[37:09] remember what he told us Church remember
[37:12] the messages you've been hearing
[37:13] throughout the years
[37:15] when the dynamic power strikes that word
[37:19] it's going to Quicken you to life
[37:21] amen hallelujah
[37:23] amen and they went out quickly and fled
[37:27] from the Sepulcher for they trembled and
[37:29] were amazed neither said they anything
[37:31] to any man for they were afraid
[37:35] right that's not the only thing yeah
[37:38] it's in verse 12 after that he appeared
[37:40] in another form unto two of them and
[37:42] they walked and went into the country
[37:44] and they were told and they went and
[37:46] told it unto the residue neither believe
[37:49] they them
[37:54] who is this the two men on the road to
[37:56] you Mayors you'll find the full account
[37:58] in Luke right yeah Mark is just bringing
[38:00] it in a simple form and then he says
[38:02] afterward he appeared unto the eleven as
[38:04] they set at meat but watch every time
[38:07] they told him Jesus is Alive
[38:09] Jesus is moving
[38:11] the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost is
[38:13] being outboard
[38:14] they didn't believe them
[38:18] afterward he appeared unto the 11 as
[38:20] they said admit and upgraded them with
[38:23] their unbelief and Hardness of Heart
[38:24] because they believed not them which
[38:27] and seen him after he was risen see what
[38:30] he says again they didn't believe those
[38:33] that saw him after he was risen
[38:38] was there another crucifixion in this
[38:39] time
[38:42] you all know the message sermons right
[38:44] was there an indictment I induct this
[38:47] generation
[38:48] There They Crucified him
[38:51] and the prophet brings an indictment
[38:54] upon them he takes them to a trial
[38:57] he finds them guilty of crucifying the
[39:00] world again in this day
[39:03] so if the word was crucified they must
[39:06] come a resurrection
[39:09] they must come a resurrection
[39:11] amen
[39:13] Hallelujah that's why he's preaching it
[39:16] is the rising of the Sun
[39:18] amen the word was crucified all these
[39:21] years but the world is arising in the
[39:23] people's hearts
[39:26] amen hallelujah blessed be the name of
[39:29] the Lord
[39:31] and when I saw okay where am I in verse
[39:35] so it says they neither believe they
[39:37] them
[39:39] amen
[39:41] I don't want to get too much into that
[39:42] so you find amen they didn't believe
[39:45] other people they are to see physically
[39:48] so if you have unbelief in your heart
[39:51] then I have the grace enough to say Lord
[39:53] I want to see your resurrection power
[39:55] personally in my life
[39:58] it's my experience on brother Joshua's
[40:01] testimony for the Ramesh testimony

[46:20] if not
[46:22] that Revelation 10 yes
[46:24] a message from another world came down

[46:29] book bringing
[46:31] [Music]
[46:32] love Amen brother
[46:33] we got him now amen hallelujah
[46:37] amen
[46:39] I'm asking you what's your expectation
[46:41] because Jesus just turned the picture to
[46:43] the right
[46:45] if you get where I am in that book
[46:48] Jesus turned the picture for the
[46:50] disciples he turned the picture for the
[46:52] three women
[46:53] he turned the picture for all of them
[46:56] they were looking at a dead Jesus
[47:00] and they call Jesus
[47:02] you can pick it up in paragraph 15.
[47:06] they were looking at a dead Jesus and a
[47:09] cold Jesus
[47:15] and some look at the cloud and they're
[47:16] looking at a rain cloud
[47:20] some are looking and they're seeing
[47:21] seven angels
[47:24] but the Angels only form the wig
[47:27] yeah he says well if you turn the
[47:29] picture like this and look
[47:32] you probably can't see it from the
[47:33] audience it's Christ
[47:36] see his eyes looking here just as
[47:38] perfect as it could be wearing the white
[47:40] wig of supreme deity and the judge of
[47:43] all heavens and earth can you see his
[47:45] eyes nose mouth congregation says amen
[47:48] he says he said just turn the picture
[47:50] from this way
[47:51] the way they took it in Life Magazine
[47:54] and he says
[47:57] just turn the picture from this the way
[47:59] they had it this way the way it's
[48:02] supposed to be
[48:05] I was tempted recently
[48:07] I walked into the church and I'm looking
[48:09] at this picture and it's another way
[48:11] I was feeling a bit bad to go turn it to
[48:13] the right
[48:15] I didn't want to be escorted out before
[48:17] I preach
[48:19] amen
[48:21] but the prophet says the way it's
[48:22] supposed to be
[48:25] turn it to the right
[48:28] amen
[48:31] can you see it he is supreme judge there
[48:33] is none other but him and that is a
[48:36] perfect identification again a
[48:38] Vindication that this message is the
[48:40] truth
[48:41] amen hello did you read that some people
[48:43] say the cloud was not the vindication
[48:46] what is the prophet telling you
[48:48] and this is the perfect identification
[48:50] again a Vindication that this message is
[48:54] the truth amen While others are taking
[48:56] out the cloud from their church we are
[49:00] saying it's a Vindication of the message
[49:01] it's a Vindication of Revelation 10. we
[49:05] stand on moved we stand with the prophet
[49:08] and his testimony
[49:12] amen he says this is the truth it's true
[49:15] not making him the third person but the
[49:18] only person
[49:19] amen hallelujah
[49:22] amen and the prophet day in verse 16
[49:24] you'll finally sing how he's looking to
[49:26] the right amen he says he comes this
[49:30] light shining on the right hand side to
[49:32] which he's looking because on the cross
[49:34] when you look to the right he pardoned
[49:35] The Sinner
[49:36] it says in the light of his resurrection
[49:38] we shall go forth in his name
[49:42] amen Hallelujah
[49:45] in fact this was a culmination of
[49:47] everything he told him
[49:50] follow me he told him about it that in
[49:53] 1933 a voice spoke to him and told him
[49:56] as John the Baptist 4 and the first
[49:58] coming your message shall foreign my
[50:00] second coming
[50:02] amen
[50:06] your message and you know he says he
[50:08] didn't have a message and he was waiting
[50:10] that's why he moved his family and he
[50:13] went Westwood he went to connect with
[50:15] the angels message he went there for the
[50:17] blast
[50:18] he went to connect with the mighty angel
[50:22] so he told him about it since 1933 and
[50:26] they wouldn't believe him
[50:28] but here was a prophet being faithful
[50:29] right division
[50:32] amen make it known upon plates of
[50:35] tablets of stone so he told him write

[52:54] I'm gone now to first uh paragraph 62.
[52:58] Hebrews 13 8 is made flesh in you
[53:04] if quickening power leads in you
[53:07] Hebrews 13 8 becomes personified in you
[53:10] because then you can't look for somebody
[53:12] else to bring you to pass

[53:44] amen
[53:46] it says we are his beneficiaries are to
[53:48] prove his life is in us now
[53:51] the beneficiaries of his life the same
[53:53] life same powers that he had when he was
[53:56] here on Earth from God right here he
[53:58] goes on you're gonna have to find this I
[54:00] think it's a bit down there how will I
[54:02] know the message of the hour
[54:04] he says God proves what he promised and
[54:06] he talks about it that is the
[54:08] identification that we are beneficiaries
[54:10] with him in the resurrection he proved
[54:13] what he talked about
[54:16] amen
[54:17] Hallelujah
[54:21] paragraph 18 hear what he says now what
[54:24] the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit
[54:25] does he says his Spirit brings the same
[54:28] life again on the Earth
[54:32] um
[54:33] his Spirit brings the same life on the
[54:38] earth and in 97 we want to get to this
[54:40] now amen
[54:42] we're close with this
[54:44] 97 he says because I live you live also
[54:48] speaking to his wife
[54:50] because I live you live also what a
[54:54] resurrection that was and what a
[54:57] resurrection this is
[54:59] have you been resurrected this morning
[55:01] is collecting power in you what a
[55:04] resurrection this is Amen to be
[55:06] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[55:08] in Christ Jesus by God's quickening
[55:11] power amen he said how much like the
[55:14] Bible until the worship until the Holy
[55:16] Spirit comes upon the people to Quicken
[55:19] that word amen yeah he's talking now
[55:21] about
[55:23] you know the Cadillac
[55:26] you must have heard this we talk about
[55:28] it many times how people pay a ham and a
[55:31] leg for the BMW but they don't have fuel
[55:34] to put in the car a car is parked in the
[55:36] house
[55:38] okay nice they're polishing it they
[55:42] don't have fuel
[55:43] right so the prophet really labels that
[55:46] point I don't want to do that this
[55:47] morning you can read in the message he
[55:49] says
[55:50] here the gasoline represents the word
[55:54] the truth
[55:55] amen and he says the Holy Spirit comes
[55:57] upon that person to Quicken that word
[56:00] but without the spirit you don't move
[56:02] nine one or four he says we've put let's
[56:05] get this up 104.
[56:07] this is what we've been preaching over
[56:08] the weeks right
[56:10] we said we are in the book of it is the
[56:12] rising of the Sun
[56:14] hear me out now and your older brothers
[56:16] you can hear this as well
[56:17] because it really comes to life when I
[56:19] say all the brothers remember I've also
[56:21] been the message for a very long time
[56:25] amen I might be 44 years old I know some
[56:27] of
[56:28] this you really think I'm 20. but
[56:31] I might be 44 years old but I've been in
[56:34] the message for a long time amen I know
[56:36] some of you think hey this brother's
[56:37] living in the body change but no
[56:40] amen he says we have put too much fresh
[56:43] on the mechanics
[56:45] too much stress
[56:49] and nothing on the dynamic
[56:51] now watch his wording does he say we put
[56:54] some
[56:57] he said we put too much on the mechanics
[57:00] and nothing on the dynamic
[57:03] it needs the dynamic power of God the
[57:06] resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon
[57:09] the church to manifest and bring to pass
[57:12] that this is gasoline gasoline is being
[57:15] poured out in the 117th year of the
[57:18] latest year in church age amen the holy
[57:20] spirit is being poured out
[57:24] it says it might be in a gasoline can it
[57:27] could still be water
[57:30] you could be hiding what's in your can
[57:33] you know like that people in Matthew 25
[57:36] with your own with oil maybe you've got
[57:38] water there and you carrying and telling
[57:39] everyone here I got oil here
[57:41] we don't know until you point out right
[57:44] that's what the property is saying you
[57:46] carrying your gasoline can but it could
[57:48] be water but the only proof of it put
[57:51] this life on it
[57:54] prove whether it's whether it's getting
[57:56] or not
[57:58] [Music]
[58:01] it'll burn a lot of sin it'll burn our
[58:04] drinking smoking gambling a doubts me
[58:06] amen pornography amen it will drive all
[58:10] unbelief out

[58:14] ourselves with nonsense we feed
[58:16] ourselves with movies we feed ourselves

[58:20] showmax put a little word into you

[58:51] pride in 65 he couldn't see it but amen
[58:55] if my voice didn't get to that sixth
[58:57] Dimension right now I want to say
[58:58] brother Branham that bride is here on
[59:01] the Earth right now amen and I'm
[59:03] preaching to Earth the same gospel that

[59:11] form
[59:14] amen hallelujah he says there has to
[59:17] come a real bride are you a real bride I
[59:20] believe you're a real bride amen
[59:23] there must come one not only got the
[59:25] mechanics not only got the word
[59:29] but the Dynamics of it makes the church
[59:33] live yes make it live
[59:36] if that's you see me maybe it's you that
[59:38] says Lord I just have the word say Lord
[59:41] Make It live in me give me the dynamic
[59:43] uppouring of the Holy Ghost amen
[59:46] amen amen
[59:48] until we come to that place until we
[59:50] find that place what good does it do to
[59:53] polish the hubs
[59:55] sure
[59:56] what good does it give to give her a
[59:58] facelift or a sermonized job when
[1:00:00] there's no Dynamics to it
[1:00:02] oh the Lord help me forgive me for this
[1:00:05] but there's too many churches
[1:00:07] just preaching a sermon to people this
[1:00:09] morning
[1:00:10] no Dynamic power
[1:00:12] I am even willing to take you up on your
[1:00:14] challenge if you are sick right now I
[1:00:16] don't care your situation how impossible
[1:00:17] it seems amen God can heal you right now
[1:00:20] in his presence yes amen that's the
[1:00:23] dynamic power of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:26] he says no matter how much the mechanics
[1:00:29] prove to be right
[1:00:33] isn't that what we've been living to
[1:00:34] tell everyone all these years
[1:00:36] we've got the right mechanics he says no
[1:00:40] matter how much the mechanics prove
[1:00:42] proved you right we can send our best
[1:00:44] teachers
[1:00:47] teachers there has got to be a dynamic
[1:00:51] to make it work
[1:00:55] 111 quickly now and he says as he being
[1:00:58] the groom
[1:00:59] the bride has to come forth because it's
[1:01:02] part of him
[1:01:03] and it can be only be the manifestation
[1:01:06] of the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:01:08] any other spoke of the Bride it can only
[1:01:11] manifest you see what he's saying he's
[1:01:14] not talking about the only Theory Theory
[1:01:16] Theory he's saying the only thing he can
[1:01:18] do is try to produce a manifestation in
[1:01:20] you
[1:01:21] start to produce it yes
[1:01:26] right if you do something different from
[1:01:30] the groom then you're not bride that's
[1:01:32] what he's saying then
[1:01:34] if you don't have the same life as him
[1:01:36] the same outpouring as him he says you
[1:01:39] are not bright because she is flesh of
[1:01:41] his flesh bone of his bone life of his
[1:01:44] life Jesus is not like Stephen Hawking
[1:01:47] what's his name
[1:01:49] the brilliant man who died what's his
[1:01:50] name
[1:01:52] Stephen Hawkins you saw he says he saw
[1:01:54] his body yes that's not Jesus
[1:02:00] you know what I'm talking about
[1:02:02] one brilliant yeah I think he died now
[1:02:05] yeah
[1:02:06] but he was so brilliant in his mind
[1:02:10] but he had no use of his body do you
[1:02:12] think Jesus is like that but that's how
[1:02:15] some churches are
[1:02:16] Jesus got no use of his body there they
[1:02:18] crippled him
[1:02:21] only the Mind Jesus
[1:02:24] they say Christ is the head
[1:02:26] but the body is deformed it's crippled
[1:02:30] it says if it does something different
[1:02:32] from the groom it isn't bright because
[1:02:34] she is flesh of his flesh born of his
[1:02:36] bone life of his life power of his power
[1:02:38] she is him
[1:02:42] as man and woman are one the woman taken
[1:02:44] from the side she has taken a spirit the
[1:02:47] feminist Spirit from him the flesh from
[1:02:49] his side made both mechanics and
[1:02:52] Dynamics the wife what is the wife
[1:02:55] both
[1:02:57] let's read that properly now
[1:03:00] cool
[1:03:02] no no go back go back I just wanted that
[1:03:05] one line then what makes the wife both
[1:03:11] the flesh from his side made both
[1:03:14] mechanics and Dynamics comma the wife
[1:03:20] I Gotta Give English lesson here this
[1:03:21] morning too
[1:03:25] so the wife is made up of both mechanics
[1:03:28] and Dynamics don't never let any church
[1:03:30] tell you we don't need certain things
[1:03:32] they are lying to you right
[1:03:34] bring them before the prophet and call
[1:03:36] them a liar
[1:03:38] because they have no free to believe
[1:03:40] things of God
[1:03:43] both mechanics and Dynamics makes up the
[1:03:46] wife
[1:03:48] the spirit of him and the Flesh of him
[1:03:50] and put it together and made mechanics
[1:03:53] and Dynamics it says all until the 1 13
[1:03:57] now until the church becomes both
[1:03:59] Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of
[1:04:01] God that moved him to do the things that
[1:04:04] he did hello
[1:04:12] listen you must do the things that he
[1:04:13] did yes did he heal the sick did he
