[0:00] this afternoon, oh God, and may your
[0:01] spirit brood over us, Lord, tonight. Oh
[0:04] God, we bring the sick and afflicted
[0:06] before you, oh God. Even as saints have
[0:08] come tonight, Lord, even being unwell in
[0:10] body, Lord, I know that you have already
[0:12] done the work of redemption. And Lord,
[0:14] healing is your chosen bread, Lord. And
[0:17] Lord, right now, we draw from that from
[0:20] that shelf of healing, oh God, from that
[0:22] grocery shelf of redemption that you've
[0:23] given unto us. We draw healing tonight.
[0:26] And Lord, we give it to your children
[0:28] tonight, Lord. May they receive it now
[0:30] in the name of Jesus. And I pray Lord
[0:33] Jesus and every other need that your
[0:35] children may have Lord. Those that are
[0:36] financial needs right now, we draw from
[0:39] that grocery shelf tonight. And we give
[0:41] it to your children in the name of
[0:42] Jesus.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Whatever things your children have need
[0:45] of, may they come and Lord, draw from
[0:47] there, Lord. May they draw strength from
[0:49] you tonight, oh God, and recognize that
[0:51] they are yet to commune with you and
[0:53] meet with you, Lord, in the evening
[0:55] time. And that's the time of fellowship,
[0:57] Lord. Even as your prophet told us,
[0:59] Lord, Adam and Eve will play all day
[1:01] with the lions and like little kittens,
[1:03] oh God. But Lord, when the sun went down
[1:05] in the evening time, Adam will put his
[1:07] arms around Eve and take into Lord, have
[1:10] that fellowship with you, Lord, into the
[1:11] cathedral, oh God, because Lord, it's
[1:13] worship time, oh God. It's time to
[1:15] praise you, oh God. It's time to worship
[1:18] the King. Oh, blessed be your name. All
[1:21] praise, glory, and honor belongs to you,
[1:22] Father. We thank you that we could be
[1:24] gathered, Lord, once again in this
[1:25] fashion. And Lord, we give you the
[1:27] preeminence now in Jesus name. Amen. And
[1:30] amen.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Once again, wonderful to be found
[1:36] &gt;&gt; in the house of God. Amen.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Through the cold weather, may we find
[1:43] warmth in his word. Amen.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47] &gt;&gt; As you can see, tensions are rising.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Uh the prophet told us the time piece is
[1:53] Israel.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Gentiles don't have a time piece.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; But the clock, the time piece is Israel.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; So you can see right now all eyes are on
[2:03] Israel.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; Tensions are there.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; And it's not by coincidence.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; Israel is on the offensive.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Is knew that there was going to be a
[2:13] threat. They It's like a believer. We
[2:15] don't wait and say, "Lord, we just wait
[2:17] and see. We know the devil is working.
[2:19] We can see the devil is working and we
[2:21] know what he's doing. We we are
[2:22] discerning the devil is working." and
[2:24] you stay quiet about it. They went on
[2:26] the offensive
[2:27] &gt;&gt; and they named the operation operation
[2:31] rising lion.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; It's not by coincidence
[2:35] &gt;&gt; because why? The second coming he comes
[2:38] &gt;&gt; as a lion from the tribe of Judah. Amen.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; So no true believer when he's discerning
[2:45] things are not going right in his life,
[2:47] things not going right in his family, is
[2:49] just going to sit back.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; They go on the offensive against him.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; And where they are dominating now is in
[2:56] the air.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Believers don't fight the battle on the
[2:59] ground. Amen.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; We fight it in the air. Amen.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; In heavenly places. Amen. And that's
[3:06] where we are today. In heavenly places
[3:08] in Christ Jesus.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got our Bibles. We turn to the
[3:11] book of Genesis. Reading from Genesis
[3:14] 12:1. Amen. The glorious hour to be a
[3:17] Christian. Amen.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[3:22] Genesis 12:1.
[3:27] Now the Lord had said unto Abraham,
[3:30] "Get thee out of thy country,
[3:35] and from thy kindred, and from thy
[3:39] father's house unto a land that I will
[3:42] show thee, and I will make of thee a
[3:46] great nation."
[3:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; And I will bless thee.
[3:51] So now in other words, God wants to
[3:54] bless Abraham. But what you must do? You
[3:55] must get thee out.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; And make thy name great.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be a blessing.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; And I will bless them that bless thee,
[4:10] and curse them that cursse thee. And in
[4:13] thee shall all the families of the earth
[4:15] be blessed.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Just one more scripture before we be
[4:18] seated. Turn to the book of 2
[4:20] Corinthians chapter 6 reading from
[4:23] verses 14 and 18.
[4:27] The Apostle Paul is saying here
[4:29] be not unequally yolked together with
[4:34] unbelievers.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; For what fellowship at righteousness
[4:39] with unrighteousness?
[4:42] &gt;&gt; And what communion at light with
[4:44] darkness?
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. And what concord at Christ would
[4:49] bile? Or what part at he that believeth
[4:53] with an infidel?
[4:56] &gt;&gt; And what agreement at the temple of God
[4:59] with idols?
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; For ye are the temple of the living God.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; As God had said, I will dwell in them.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, God dwells in me.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; And walk in them. Somebody say, "God
[5:17] works in me."
[5:18] &gt;&gt; God works in me.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; And I will be their God and they shall
[5:23] be my people.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; So, he's not just going to be anybody's
[5:27] people.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; He wants to be a people. He wants to be
[5:30] a God of who? Where they made him his
[5:34] temple where he can dwell in them, then
[5:37] he can be their God. Amen.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; So, and he says, "Wherefore come out
[5:43] from among them."
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. and be ye separate, say the Lord,
[5:49] &gt;&gt; and touch not the unclean thing, and I
[5:51] will receive you, and will be a father
[5:54] unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
[5:57] daughters, say the Lord Almighty. Amen.
[6:00] You may be seated. Thank you, Lord.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to speak a little title
[6:08] tonight.
[6:10] Called out to be blessed.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we know that we are the call.
[6:15] We were called out.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; But what we were called out for.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; We were called out to be blessed.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; Because why? They were blessing imputed
[6:25] unto us.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; Blessings that were meant for us.
[6:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were God. We were special class
[6:32] of people.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; We were God's. We are sons and daughters
[6:36] of God means that we always existed in
[6:39] him. Amen.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; We were part of him.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had enriched blessings for
[6:44] us.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; But we are to be called out from
[6:48] something that was cursed.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; Come come come out from the cursed
[6:52] thing.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; So we speaking on a message. Called out
[6:58] to be blessed. Amen.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; It's it's good to say we called out, but
[7:02] called out for what?
[7:03] &gt;&gt; Just to what? Just to come and say we
[7:05] have a message just to be another
[7:07] church. No. Because while we are being
[7:10] positioned, we are positioning. The
[7:13] message has been positioning us for
[7:14] what? For blessing.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. The message, the shout has come to
[7:19] be positioning us for blessing.
[7:23] Now, as soon as you think about
[7:24] blessing, it's it's got everything to do
[7:26] with all good things. Amen. The Bible
[7:28] said all things work together for the
[7:31] good to them that love the Lord.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; So, what does it mean to be unequally
[7:38] yolked? What is Apostle Paul talking
[7:39] about? Now, we know that Paul is using a
[7:42] term. It's like a farming term, right?
[7:45] Because he takes it from Deuteronomy
[7:47] 22:10 where it says, "Thou shalt not
[7:49] plow with an ox and an ass together."
[7:53] &gt;&gt; He's talking about being unequally
[7:55] yolked.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; So, it speaks of two different natures.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; So, in other words, he's showing you
[8:02] here now in Deuteronomy, one is clean
[8:04] and one is unclean.
[8:07] One is obedient, one is stubborn.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Now can you imagine being equally yolked
[8:13] with somebody in this because you are
[8:17] believing something and somebody else is
[8:19] not believing something. How can you be
[8:21] agreement there?
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; One is rejoicing on his words.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; One is being stubborn.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Don't want to accept this words.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; The word says be baptized in the name of
[8:33] the Lord Jesus Christ. The other one
[8:34] saying, "No, I can't accept that."
[8:36] &gt;&gt; They're being stubborn to believe it.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; They sing it there.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; They sing it there in the prince.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; They sing in every part of the Bible
[8:44] there,
[8:45] &gt;&gt; but they still don't accept it. They're
[8:46] still stubborn.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; That's two different natures.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; One is clean, one is unclean.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; Because why? One is of the flesh.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; One is not born again.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Because when you're born again, now
[9:02] there's a change that takes place. Amen.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; God takes your stony art, gives you out
[9:06] of takes your out of stone, makes it out
[9:08] of flesh.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; He gives you a nature change.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; He changes your taste buds. Amen.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; Once you desired for the things of the
[9:16] world, once you desire to be like all
[9:18] the other sinners, your because why? In
[9:21] you, you had a thirsting
[9:24] &gt;&gt; and the thirsting was for God.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; But the devil took advantage of that.
[9:31] The devil pulled on the thirst and he
[9:33] started to give you the desires of the
[9:35] world.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; Because why? It looks nice. It looks
[9:40] desirable. It looks pleasing to the eye.
[9:44] But it only lasts for a moment.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; The minute you partake of it, the devil
[9:49] makes a mockery out of you.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; He leaves you in that mockery. He leaves
[9:52] you in that corner.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; But the grace of God.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're a son and daughter of
[9:58] God, if you are part of him, the grace
[10:01] of the God is always there to pull you
[10:02] out.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because all that belong to him
[10:06] must come to him.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; He knows how to pull his shoulder out.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; The devil comes and he abuses you. He
[10:13] takes advantage of you
[10:15] &gt;&gt; and he ravishes you, rvishes your life,
[10:18] messes up your life. But the grace of
[10:20] God,
[10:22] &gt;&gt; you are to come with his transforming
[10:24] power. Oh, what a word that can take
[10:27] you. And though you were so abused,
[10:29] though you were so rubbish by the devil,
[10:31] though you were so you were in such a
[10:34] condition that everyone looked down on
[10:35] you, maybe you was a black sheep of your
[10:37] family and the people spoke evil of you
[10:41] and because they know what condition
[10:42] that you have been in because what is
[10:45] happening now? The devil is making a
[10:47] mockery of you.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something dear
[10:51] friends, the grace of God.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; God loves you
[10:57] &gt;&gt; with an unconditional love.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; He made a covenant with Abraham. I will.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; God couldn't lie on any man anymore. He
[11:06] saw man is in such a condition. But here
[11:08] he calls out Abraham.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he gives the Abra instruction.
[11:13] Get thee out of thy country and from thy
[11:15] kindred and from thy father's house unto
[11:18] a land that I will show thee.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we thought we had
[11:23] everything in this life. We thought we
[11:25] had things going. But one day, oh, the
[11:27] word came our way and said, "I get thee
[11:30] out from where you are. Get the art from
[11:32] every organization. Get the out from
[11:34] your worldly condition into the land
[11:36] that I will show you. Come into the land
[11:38] of the Holy Ghost. Come into the land of
[11:40] rest. The land where you belong." Amen.
[11:43] The land where now in this you can have
[11:46] peace. You can have prosperity. You can
[11:48] have joy unspeakable.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:51] Amen.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; And in this land, you will be fortified.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; In this land, no enemy can come to you.
[11:57] The devil cannot ravish you. The devil
[11:59] cannot take advantage of you because
[12:01] why? You are fortified under my words.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I will bless thee."
[12:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; Because he's calling us to us to be
[12:11] blessed.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. First thing he did was he called
[12:14] us for a total separation from unbelief.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we come out from all the
[12:19] unbelief, then he comes now and gives us
[12:22] his words.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; And we find honor and rich blessings in
[12:25] his word. Amen.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; The bless is an inexhaust. The the word
[12:29] as an inexhaustible fountain of
[12:31] blessings. Amen.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Because why? Every redemptive blessing
[12:36] is in there.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Is stored up in there. It's rich with
[12:39] blessings. Amen.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in there, he's going to show
[12:45] you, you are just not called to be have
[12:47] a temporal life.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; You are called to eternal life.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; And all that you love, you're not going
[12:56] to have temporal fellowship with him.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; All that ever loved you, you're not
[13:00] going to have temporal fellowship with
[13:01] him. You're going to have eternal
[13:03] fellowship.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because why? You are special class
[13:08] of people.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Your nature is different.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are now a fake civilization.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; You speak things though they were as as
[13:17] if even if it's not there. You speak as
[13:19] if it's already there.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; You can take my word and say right, I
[13:23] have need of this and I'm speaking into
[13:26] existence.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[13:31] &gt;&gt; didn't Jesus do that?
[13:34] Jesus they coming to collect tax
[13:37] one day
[13:39] &gt;&gt; and then they look at him the disciples
[13:41] look at him said no go there catch that
[13:43] fish
[13:44] &gt;&gt; in that fish what's there
[13:46] &gt;&gt; where did that money come from
[13:48] &gt;&gt; amen
[13:50] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord
[13:50] &gt;&gt; he's the same yesterday
[13:52] &gt;&gt; today and forever
[13:55] &gt;&gt; amen
[13:58] so you find that Paul here is using this
[14:00] farming term because He's speaking of
[14:03] two different natures.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; You cannot be unequally yolked. Amen.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; But if we are together, if we are yolked
[14:11] together, that means if we the natures
[14:13] are together, the two can walk together.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; The two are believing on the same word
[14:17] together.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine coming now?
[14:21] Because when we come together in a
[14:22] fellowship, we must be together, one
[14:24] mind, one accord, one spirit. Amen.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; You cannot be sitting in a fellowship
[14:29] where we are now unequally yolked
[14:31] together. Yes.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; One is believing in one doctrine, one is
[14:35] believing another doctrine. No,
[14:37] &gt;&gt; we've got to be yolked together. You got
[14:39] to come
[14:40] &gt;&gt; under a under the leadership of the Holy
[14:43] Spirit. Amen.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; And you've got to understand that the
[14:48] Holy Spirit is the one that is leading
[14:49] his church.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So
[14:54] you know the prophet said you cannot
[14:55] yoke a believer with an unbeliever
[14:59] &gt;&gt; without there being a pull or a
[15:00] resistance.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; You know one is like that stubborn
[15:03] nature you know a resistance from the
[15:05] truth.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; It's like today a believer marrying an
[15:11] unbeliever
[15:13] &gt;&gt; or we going and joining denominations or
[15:17] joining a ecumenical system. No the word
[15:19] has already pulled us out. Yes.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; He already told us, he brought us into a
[15:22] different fold now.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; He brought us into a different covering.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; You can't even go there.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Trust me, you can't go there.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; If you're already pulled in by Christ,
[15:31] no one can pull you out of there.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; You might go and try it. You might go in
[15:38] a little bit of a time in a back. It's
[15:39] called a backsliding condition. Paul
[15:40] said, "I backslide daily, but quickly
[15:42] you'll be brought to repentance."
[15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Very quick you'll be brought to
[15:46] repentance.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you have a nature change.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; You have a different nature.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; You won't be making alliances with
[15:55] people that deny the word.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; Watch who you make your alliances with.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Now when you when when you when he's
[16:02] calling us from separation, he means it
[16:04] doesn't mean we mustn't be around
[16:05] people. No, no, no, no. He didn't call
[16:06] us for isolation.
[16:09] But it means do not be yolked to them or
[16:12] unequally yolked to them.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; In other words, don't be influenced by
[16:15] them. That's right. Amen.
[16:18] But you can influence them.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Don't form alliances with them. What is
[16:23] alliances? Allianc mean you are in
[16:25] agreement of things.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; You're in companionship.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; You can't be fellowshipping with
[16:31] somebody that keep denying the word.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Unless you know that God led you to this
[16:36] person, you now have to witness to this
[16:37] person.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; That's the difference.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; But if you are finding yourself very
[16:41] comfortable, it's like this.
[16:44] If you if I leave you in a with a person
[16:47] that's constantly using vulgar language,
[16:51] &gt;&gt; you will be uncomfortable with them.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; But if you are there and and you are
[16:56] able to tell a person, listen here,
[16:57] under my presence, you wouldn't speak
[16:59] this language.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; And the person respects you, then you'll
[17:02] be amongst them.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; But you understand the principle behind
[17:05] it.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; You cannot be having this alliance with
[17:09] the people of the world. Right.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; You cannot be comfortable with the
[17:13] people of the world. Then there's
[17:14] something wrong because why? You are
[17:16] called out for their blessing.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; And you're going to be stopping your
[17:20] blessing.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; Because of this not being separated from
[17:23] them.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Not separated from the spirit of Leia.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:30] God is positioning us for a blessing.
[17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Because why? This is the hour of total
[17:38] separation from unbelief.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the darkest hour.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. In an hour where the
[17:47] the through the fourth dimension
[17:49] influencing all over the world, it has
[17:52] such a strong influence
[17:54] &gt;&gt; in the homes of people. That's right.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; In the workplaces of people,
[17:58] &gt;&gt; it has such a strong influence
[18:01] &gt;&gt; because Fam mentioned it can influence
[18:04] people in a certain narrative. Yes,
[18:06] &gt;&gt; if people want to want to project a
[18:08] certain narrative, they can use the four
[18:09] dimension social media and so forth. And
[18:12] people can easily believe those things
[18:16] &gt;&gt; if they haven't had a conversion.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[18:19] &gt;&gt; there must be a conversion. Amen.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; You know,
[18:26] you can bring the shyest person.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; That's why sometime you got to test if a
[18:30] person really has a conversion.
[18:32] That person cannot remain shy after a
[18:35] conversion.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; I think the prophet speaks gives a
[18:37] illustration somewhere about some
[18:39] sisters whatever when they were shy.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; You cannot be remain in a condition in
[18:46] that same condition after a conversion.
[18:48] You won't be able to not speak.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; You will be able to speak of the
[18:53] goodness of God.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; You will be able to profess of what God
[18:56] has done for you.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:00] There's something about a conversion,
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Peter was denying Jesus.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Three times.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; But after the conversion,
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; After the conversion,
[19:16] &gt;&gt; he had boldness. Amen.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; And the believers also prayed for more
[19:21] boldness. Amen.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; They wasn't the same people.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; People say, "Who is this person? This
[19:27] person, they couldn't even talk. M you
[19:30] might be a person just sitting here and
[19:31] maybe you can't even speak but trust me
[19:33] after you have a true conversion and the
[19:35] baptism of the Holy Spirit and anointed
[19:38] from God you your your people will be
[19:40] astonished at the way you speak.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; You might not be a preacher but they'll
[19:44] be astonished at the stand that you take
[19:46] for the word
[19:46] &gt;&gt; and the things that you tell them. Amen.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; So this is the hour of total separation
[19:55] &gt;&gt; and positioning. Amen.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:02] Now the call to come out from among the
[20:04] among them
[20:06] is not a rejection but it was an
[20:09] invitation
[20:10] to into inheritance.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we are called out from among
[20:15] them when that little eagle
[20:18] &gt;&gt; was stuck in the chicken barnyard
[20:22] when it was called up into so into the
[20:24] heavenlies. It was called for his
[20:26] inheritance, for his rightful
[20:27] inheritance
[20:28] &gt;&gt; because of who it was. Amen.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; When we were called out, we were called
[20:32] and coming into to come out from among
[20:36] them from the unbelief to come into our
[20:38] inheritance.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz all this blessing, all this word is
[20:42] our blessing. It's our inheritance. The
[20:44] land of the Holy Ghost is full of our
[20:45] blessing. It's full of our inheritance.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; It was meant for us. Amen.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. It might have been preached years
[20:52] ago when the prophet is preaching these
[20:54] messages, storing it up. Spiritual food
[20:56] being stored up, but this great food was
[20:58] stored up for us.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Now the table has been spread and God is
[21:04] using the five-fold ministry to bring it
[21:06] out. Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Because it's a blessing to the people.
[21:09] Amen.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; So from Abraham all the way to the
[21:14] bride, the principle remains the same.
[21:17] God blesses you after you come out.
[21:21] And the coming out might seem hey okay I
[21:23] left my I left the world I left all that
[21:26] I believe the message now
[21:27] &gt;&gt; he's not that only it's a total
[21:30] separation.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; You've got to recognize your pos. You
[21:33] got to come into your position. Amen.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; You've got to recognize who you truly
[21:38] are.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; You've got to recognize that God has a
[21:42] certain place that he wants you to be
[21:44] in.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; And only when you're there can you
[21:46] inherit all his blessings. Amen.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; I can't be where brother Adrien is.
[21:53] That's his blessings.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; That's his position. I have to be in my
[21:57] position.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; And then I'm enjoying my blessings.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might be called up for
[22:02] something else. You got to be in your
[22:04] position. And when you're in your
[22:06] position, you will enjoy your blessings.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; So God has a position for each of us.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; So that is why the Holy Ghost is
[22:14] positionally placing us.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Through the five ministry. Amen.
[22:19] Positionally placing his children. And
[22:21] when they are there where they supposed
[22:23] to be positionally placed, they will
[22:25] enjoy the blessings of God.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; But sometime they have to cause a
[22:30] separation. Sometime we go and try to
[22:33] fellowship because it feels sentimental.
[22:37] We have to fellowship with certain
[22:38] people or it just feels good. We have to
[22:40] fellowship with certain people. But God
[22:42] might say, "No, no. I need you here. I
[22:45] need you to be positionally placed here
[22:47] because this is where I want to use you
[22:49] &gt;&gt; and this is where you're going to have
[22:50] your blessings. Amen.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; So we look at the pattern from Abraham.
[22:56] Separation unlocks blessings.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; It might not seem nice sometimes.
[23:02] It didn't seem very easy when we all had
[23:04] to leave our denomination and tell our
[23:08] families that we are believing this
[23:10] message and we believe a prophet is
[23:12] dead.
[23:14] It wasn't an easy thing,
[23:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[23:16] &gt;&gt; If you think of it,
[23:18] &gt;&gt; especially for sisters that when their
[23:20] families knew the the type of dressing
[23:23] they had and all and now they are
[23:24] conforming to the to the word and to the
[23:26] Bible and the way that the Bible teaches
[23:28] a woman to dress up and so forth.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; They had to suffer rejection.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; They had to get persecuted by their
[23:36] families.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; But something told them, something made
[23:39] them see that this is the church.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Something made them seem, hey,
[23:44] &gt;&gt; people of the world, they calling
[23:45] themselves Christians, but they don't
[23:46] look like Christians.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; There's nothing different from the
[23:50] people of the world
[23:51] &gt;&gt; and the church people.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; They're all the same. If I go to a
[23:56] nightclub, the people dress up in a
[23:57] certain way. If I go to the church, they
[23:59] dress up in the same way.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; So, they never see a difference. M
[24:08] &gt;&gt; but when you came across this message
[24:11] &gt;&gt; and you realize that this is
[24:14] &gt;&gt; this is Christianity according to the
[24:15] Bible
[24:17] &gt;&gt; this is the old time religion
[24:20] &gt;&gt; this is the same religion that the
[24:22] apostles believed in
[24:24] &gt;&gt; because at that time then you then you
[24:26] began to realize that a message has come
[24:28] to turn your hearts to the faith of the
[24:30] fathers.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. So you realize now that
[24:36] as you started to come out and you
[24:38] started to conform to the word that
[24:40] separation started to unlock your
[24:42] blessings
[24:44] &gt;&gt; because why? Now at one stage in your
[24:46] life out of the Holy Ghost you realize
[24:48] that you was you was never satisfied in
[24:51] life. He was always thirsting after
[24:53] something and nothing could satisfy the
[24:55] thirsts and you was always an anxious
[24:57] person or you you're looking at life in
[25:00] a different way in a carnal to to
[25:02] carnality but now you find peace.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; You find joy. Yes, you'll face all the
[25:07] circumstances. Yes, the devil will be
[25:09] out raging after you and you'll have all
[25:11] the situations that you'll face but you
[25:13] have this peace.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; You are settled in your heart. Amen.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; And you find comfort in the word of God.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every time you come and read
[25:21] the word of God, you find that hey I'm
[25:23] in a different place
[25:24] &gt;&gt; because why? You are being seated in
[25:26] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; So you find that the the separation
[25:32] started to unlock your blessings.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; So God could not bless Abraham fully.
[25:40] Now we know he left the land of earth
[25:43] but he was still with Lot.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Lot was still hanging around.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. It was sentimental for him
[25:49] to keep Lot because why Lot is family.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; But there the whole God knows how to
[25:55] work things.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Problem started to come.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Problem will always come with people in
[26:01] the flesh.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the people of God, we look at
[26:06] things in a spiritual way.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you live with the people of the
[26:09] world, you'll find problems in the
[26:11] flesh.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you go to fellowship
[26:14] around the word and the things of God is
[26:17] different. Amen.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; But you're in a fellowship around
[26:19] fleshly things, you'll have problems.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; So problem began to come. And what it
[26:24] was because God wants to separate
[26:26] Abraham completely.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Because he wants to unlock Abraham's
[26:30] blessings.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Because remember, he wants to make
[26:33] Abraham a great nation.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; He wants to bless him a separate person.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; And he want to make them a peculiar
[26:40] people, a peculiar nation.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:44] M
[26:46] &gt;&gt; so what God is saying to us spiritually
[26:49] separate from the worldly yolks
[26:52] &gt;&gt; separate from all system that is binding
[26:54] us together
[26:55] &gt;&gt; that's keeping us earth bound
[26:57] &gt;&gt; everything that's keeping us to live in
[26:58] a carnel
[27:00] &gt;&gt; everything that making us live in the
[27:01] flesh
[27:03] &gt;&gt; everything that's not making us move to
[27:04] the plan of God
[27:07] &gt;&gt; because why we are walking into the
[27:08] image of Christ amen
[27:10] &gt;&gt; we are walking to perfection in this
[27:12] hour everything that will stop us from
[27:14] working to perfection. We need to move
[27:16] those yolks. Amen.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; So we find that when Abraham separated
[27:22] himself from Lot, then God could come
[27:24] and give him these full blessings. Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; God himself could come down to him.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Paul is saying again, be not unequally
[27:39] y. What he means by that?
[27:42] We get people today you believing a
[27:44] certain thing. You have that opportunity
[27:47] in your life to now you believe this
[27:50] wonderful message. You a Christian you
[27:52] believe in God. Amen. And you know you
[27:55] you want to now come to that stage in
[27:56] your life. You want to find yourself a
[27:58] partner. And you're going to make
[28:00] decisions in your life. I want to have a
[28:02] partner.
[28:04] And then can you imagine now Satan knows
[28:06] that? You think Satan doesn't know that?
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Satan is going to present the best
[28:10] opportunities for you. Right?
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Because Satan works with what? Pretty
[28:14] looks only. He only looks at the outside
[28:17] on the outward appearances.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; God works with character. Satan give you
[28:22] the outward appearances.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Didn't the prophet speak about Ahab and
[28:26] Jezebel?
[28:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "No way did Aab go and find
[28:29] Jezebel for the character
[28:31] &gt;&gt; because she was a murderer.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; No way did Aab go and find her." He
[28:35] said, "No, she must have been a pretty
[28:36] something that he went after. He went
[28:39] for the looks."
[28:40] Amen. So you find that you want to make
[28:43] these decisions. Now can you believe can
[28:46] how can you now go and find making this
[28:50] decision to have a partner that you're
[28:51] going to spend the rest of your life
[28:52] with?
[28:54] &gt;&gt; And if you're not and if you are
[28:56] unequally yolked together
[28:59] &gt;&gt; different natures.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Then how are you going to balance the
[29:04] family life?
[29:05] &gt;&gt; How are you going to enjoy blessings of
[29:07] God? Because why? One is moving left,
[29:10] one is moving right. Oh, because you're
[29:12] supposed to work as a component
[29:15] &gt;&gt; to become together,
[29:16] &gt;&gt; as a family component. It's just like
[29:19] that in the church. Amen. We come as a
[29:21] in every local assembly. You know, the
[29:23] prophet said each assembly is sovereign,
[29:25] right?
[29:26] &gt;&gt; He's got a pastor who is the head of the
[29:28] church. And then you have the the
[29:31] believers. We must work as a component.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we are here, we are
[29:37] working. If you swear the brother is
[29:38] down, you want to you want to bring that
[29:40] brother to the same level as you
[29:42] &gt;&gt; because why? You want to move together.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; You are walking in a certain direction.
[29:47] If the brother is going left, you hold
[29:49] down, you hold, you stop
[29:51] &gt;&gt; and then you go and you pull your
[29:52] brother's hand and you bring him, you
[29:55] build him up. You bring him to that
[29:56] level and you start moving with him.
[29:58] Amen.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Because why? You are going to a certain
[30:02] direction. Amen.
[30:04] And then you take that brother out
[30:06] because you're finding out his brother
[30:08] now is he's is now not separated from
[30:10] the things of this world
[30:12] &gt;&gt; and now he's going to lose his blessings
[30:14] but the blessings are right here.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; But you can't go enjoy the blessings
[30:17] alone because the brother is connected
[30:19] with you.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you go and pull the brother's
[30:23] hand and you're walking with him and
[30:25] you're walking together. Amen. As a band
[30:28] of believers
[30:30] &gt;&gt; marking marching on as honorary
[30:31] Christian soldiers. Amen.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; We're not leaving nothing behind. We're
[30:37] not even leaving a hoof behind. Amen.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; So we find that we align ourselves with
[30:45] people that believe the same word.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And each church must have
[30:50] doctrine, right? Each church must have.
[30:53] You can't have a wishy-washy church.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; You can't have a church believing every
[30:57] wind of doctrine. No. You must be have a
[31:00] strong foundation and you must have
[31:03] sound doctrine. The Bible said you must
[31:05] have sound you must teach sound
[31:07] doctrine.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; So if you have a church that not
[31:10] teaching sound doctrine, then there's a
[31:12] problem.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Then you'll be tossed to and fro with
[31:16] every wheel of doctrine.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; But this is not a hour to be tossed to
[31:20] and fro. This is the hour to have
[31:23] stability.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. when the when the when the waves
[31:28] are roaring around you, you need to have
[31:30] stability in this hour.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; So church must have sound mat sound
[31:37] doctrine
[31:39] and if you if you are there then you can
[31:41] have fellowship around these things then
[31:43] you have fellowship around the word
[31:46] because now you know that the holy
[31:48] spirit is bringing the word and the word
[31:50] is you're not adding to the word you're
[31:51] not taking from the word it's the same
[31:53] word. Amen. He's just giving light to
[31:56] the word.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; He's just bringing in the word that is
[31:59] needed in the hour that we living in.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Because as we have need of things, the
[32:03] Holy Spirit brings it out. Amen.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; As we are going through certain
[32:07] circumstances, the Holy Spirit knows how
[32:10] to speak to us. You might be saying,
[32:12] "Oh, but I'm sitting here, but how how
[32:14] is this thing pertaining to my life?"
[32:15] It's not man that speak. It's the Holy
[32:17] Spirit that speakth.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; It depends how you look at it. Amen.
[32:24] So you find that the wrong yoke can
[32:26] affect your walk.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; If you can fellowship in a place without
[32:31] sound doctrine or without proper
[32:33] doctrine, it can affect your walk
[32:36] because today you'll believe one thing
[32:38] and tomorrow you'll believe another
[32:40] thing. Amen. But if you got sound
[32:42] doctrine, this you'll walk in the word.
[32:45] Amen.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; And your journey will grow by the grace
[32:49] of God from glory unto glory.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And your journey will bring you
[32:53] into maturity
[32:55] &gt;&gt; because if you I can't be I can't look
[32:58] at the word that I looked at it
[33:01] &gt;&gt; 20 years ago when I came whatever years.
[33:04] Yeah. 20 years ago when I came in the
[33:05] message I can't look at the word the
[33:07] same way.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; No, I had to have a progressive walk.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; It had to bring me to a mature person.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can't but look at a believer now
[33:16] and see him maybe after 5 years 10 years
[33:19] and the same time I left him 5 years ago
[33:21] he's speaking the same things
[33:24] &gt;&gt; he's like remind me of the the
[33:26] convention you know you you meet certain
[33:29] people in the convention the same thing
[33:30] they grumbled about in our last
[33:32] convention you see them now after couple
[33:34] convention they gamble about the same
[33:35] thing
[33:37] &gt;&gt; no change
[33:39] &gt;&gt; there've got to be a change what I'm
[33:41] saying there got to be maturity Amen.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Because why? They're not separating
[33:45] themselves to unlock their blessings.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; And if they don't do that, they're not
[33:50] going to be in the right position.
[33:52] They're not in the rightful positions.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; A lot of people want to be other people
[33:55] positions.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; A lot of people who are not even called
[33:58] to be ministers want to be in ministers
[34:00] positions.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Want to be handling ministers affairs.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Things that ministers supposed to
[34:06] handle.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Spiritual thing that that you'll have to
[34:10] call a minister to handle. You get
[34:12] people who are not ministers are
[34:14] handling those things.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; What is that? A man not walking in his
[34:17] own position.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Yet if that same man walk in his own
[34:20] position, he can see blessings.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; He can have the blessings of God and he
[34:24] can enjoy the blessings of God.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Is it making sense? Amen.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; So you find that
[34:34] there's many types in the Old Testament
[34:36] type of separation for blessings. Amen.
[34:39] When God called the children of Israel,
[34:41] he had to call them for a total
[34:43] separation. He had to take them out of
[34:45] Egypt. Take them to the water baptism.
[34:48] Amen. Take them to all the stick. They
[34:50] have to apply the blood. They have to
[34:52] apply the token there in uh
[34:55] and uh God had to now show them that you
[34:58] are a separate people. You are spared
[34:59] because you apply the token.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Because you you are separated by the
[35:03] token. Amen. That's what makes the
[35:05] difference. And then when he takes them
[35:07] out of Egypt and he totally separates
[35:10] them then now he brings his word to
[35:13] them.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Then he gives them the word
[35:16] &gt;&gt; only when there was a total separation
[35:17] from unbelief.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; So you might have come in the message
[35:21] all these years
[35:23] &gt;&gt; and the word is being preached and you
[35:25] listen the message but if you are not
[35:27] coming from total separation you're not
[35:29] going to receive the word by revelation.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; You're not living in a realm of
[35:33] revelation. Right?
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Because this is the hour to be living in
[35:37] another realm. Amen.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; In a higher dimension. You can't be
[35:41] living down here. You got to come up a
[35:43] little higher.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you haven't if you haven't
[35:46] come from total separation, you're not
[35:48] going to come up higher.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Because only when they came into total
[35:51] separation could Moses go up and bring
[35:54] the word down. Amen.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; God doesn't change his ways. Amen.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:05] So what they had to have today we have
[36:08] the Holy Ghost token separates us from
[36:10] the judgment that's coming upon the
[36:12] earth.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; But what happened?
[36:16] Devil knows how to work things out.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; He knew that Israel had a word and
[36:23] Israel knew that they were different
[36:24] people.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; But what he did now? He joined them to
[36:28] the Moabites feast. Let's see what the
[36:32] prophet says about that.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[36:47] He brings them to a feast. Amen. Because
[36:50] why? He knows these people now I'm going
[36:52] to get them now
[36:54] and now I want them to fall.
[37:09] He says just what I mean look just he
[37:13] said just just what they wanted Satan's
[37:16] victory at the Moabai feast he's got
[37:19] another one coming too he's getting them
[37:21] all in the same way all at once just
[37:25] think of what they done same as it was
[37:27] it never had to take a great big long
[37:30] three or four years to draw it out. They
[37:33] the false prophet, the man that walked
[37:35] over the word of God, every warning that
[37:37] God had sent across the nation and told
[37:39] them, "Get out of it. Get out of it. Get
[37:41] out of it." They won't do it. They'll
[37:43] stay right there. They'll ignore the
[37:46] word of God. Ignore the word. ignore the
[37:49] signs. ignore the things that we're in.
[37:51] Go right on. We're going to have it
[37:53] anyhow. We're going right on over. We
[37:56] got to have it. He said see the folly of
[37:59] the devil. That's the same thing they
[38:01] did at the Nia feast.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Now he's showing you from there
[38:05] &gt;&gt; what happened to now it came to na
[38:07] feast.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Right. At nia feast where it was in Rome
[38:12] they made an organization of it.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; And we know if it happened in there if
[38:17] it happened in mobile where they going
[38:18] to now they are going now into another
[38:21] council which is the world council of
[38:23] churches.
[38:27] And we know that
[38:29] the pro he says here, notice it was then
[38:34] when Moses stepped forth and said,
[38:36] "Who's for me and God?"
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[38:39] &gt;&gt; It was then the Levite pulled his sword
[38:41] and went through the camp and utterly
[38:42] slayed everything that was connected
[38:44] with it.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Everything. Every man that had a
[38:48] Moabitete woman, they killed them right
[38:50] together.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Now the hour has come. Where is the man?
[38:55] Where is Aaron's son? Some of the
[38:57] priesthood that's willing to pull the
[38:59] word of God.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; The sharp two-edged sword.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? Where's the true
[39:04] servant of God that can take the word of
[39:07] God?
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; And to call out what it is.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; To speak the truth of the word. Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; That's not a shame to stand with the
[39:16] word and the word alone.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. To slay every demon with the word.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. not to compromise with the
[39:24] word
[39:26] &gt;&gt; who stand for me and God where is he at
[39:28] can invite invite but nobody answers so
[39:31] what I mean we don't get it there's
[39:33] something wrong it was then that Moses
[39:37] stood up and said these things notice
[39:39] their sin that they did there in the
[39:41] Moabitish feast
[39:43] &gt;&gt; when they denominated themselves with
[39:45] Moab and made them one body
[39:49] &gt;&gt; you see now they unequally yoking
[39:51] themselves together
[39:53] &gt;&gt; that sin was never forgiven them.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[39:57] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to coast on that just a
[40:00] minute.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; He said their sin was never forgiven
[40:03] them. Not one of them ever made the
[40:06] promised land.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in excuse me St. John the 6.
[40:12] Jesus said in St. John 6 when he said
[40:14] our fathers eat mana in the wilderness.
[40:17] They were Pentecostals brother. They eat
[40:19] the mana. They add the real thing. Jesus
[40:21] said, "And there everyone dead, they
[40:24] perish. They're eternally gone. Their
[40:27] sin was never forgiven them." What did
[40:30] they do? They broke their covenant with
[40:32] God and organized with Balum, the
[40:35] highing prophet that wouldn't take the
[40:37] one in of God.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't take the word of God. Wouldn't
[40:42] take nothing of God. But he was
[40:45] determined to get them all one. Can you
[40:48] see the folly? I could stay on that a
[40:50] long time, but I think you got it.
[40:53] Notice their sin was never forgive them.
[40:55] None of them that lived under those
[40:57] blessings and eat that mana and
[40:59] everything. So they had all the
[41:00] blessings, eating the mana,
[41:02] &gt;&gt; drinking from the rock, water from the
[41:04] rock and things like that. But what
[41:06] happened here now? They went to the
[41:07] feast.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; When the real true message came to a
[41:11] showdown,
[41:12] &gt;&gt; they organized it.
[41:15] Well, take we'll take Moabites and us
[41:18] together. They're a great organization,
[41:20] great nation. We're not we're not even a
[41:22] nation. We'll just marry among one
[41:25] another and we'll be all right then.
[41:27] We'll be with them. And he was never
[41:30] forgiven, never forgiven them. Jesus
[41:33] said that everyone dead. Translate that
[41:36] word in the Hebrew or Greek, either one.
[41:38] Or even in the English, it means eternal
[41:40] separation. Forever gone. That's right.
[41:42] Oh yes, they saw the miracles. They saw
[41:45] the word anointed.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; They eat the mana
[41:48] &gt;&gt; that come from heaven. They enjoyed the
[41:51] blessings of the atonement. They saw the
[41:54] smitten rock give it water. They drank
[41:56] from it. They were personally acquainted
[41:58] with it. But when it come to breaking
[42:01] that word, don't you never forget that
[42:04] when Jesus said, "I and my father are
[42:06] one."
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Didn't say there three. when all these
[42:10] other great fundamentals of the
[42:11] scripture. So if you take the same thing
[42:13] today you tell people this is the truth
[42:17] this is the doctrine of the message of
[42:19] the hour this is the true word this is
[42:22] the brother you are going out of line of
[42:25] the word this is way this is the way we
[42:27] are taught according to the word stay
[42:29] according to this they don't want to
[42:30] take it from you they want to take some
[42:33] ideas their own ideas and they want to
[42:35] go along with it because why they
[42:38] they're watching how the denomination
[42:39] world they think it's fine they think
[42:41] it's Christian no We stay with the word.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; We stay with the way we are taught. That
[42:46] is why when marriage and divorce came,
[42:49] marriage and divorce doctrine came to us
[42:51] to show us through a prophet. Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Nobody had had the guts to preach the
[42:55] true marriage and divorce doctrine until
[42:58] a prophet comes on the scene.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Because why? Everyone else was willing
[43:01] to compromise.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; And keep people in their conditions.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; But a prophet come and say and he even g
[43:07] your people that are living like this
[43:08] now stay like that. But I give grace
[43:11] unto you. Now go and teach your
[43:13] children.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's given us this word that no
[43:20] matter how we come out, he said now you
[43:22] go and teach your children. So in other
[43:24] words, you come out now. We assembly
[43:27] each assembly go and have sound doctrine
[43:29] in the true word of God.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Don't mix the word of God up. Amen.
[43:34] Don't make don't mix the word of God to
[43:36] suit any ideologies or to suit your own
[43:39] whatever things you want to do but stay
[43:42] with the true word of God because the
[43:43] plan and the ultimate purpose is to get
[43:46] people in the rapture and to get people
[43:48] into their blessing for people to come
[43:50] out to be separated from all unbelief
[43:53] and walk into their blessings
[43:55] &gt;&gt; and to walk into the inheritance in this
[43:57] hour.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:05] He say the scripture says don't yoke
[44:07] yourself um among unbelievers. Do not be
[44:11] unequally yolked together. Many places
[44:13] of the scriptures teaches us that we
[44:15] should separate ourselves. The first
[44:17] thing that God required Abraham to do
[44:19] when he called him was to separate
[44:21] himself from his people his kind and
[44:23] then he be blessed and then he bless
[44:25] him.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Now it doesn't mean you have to leave
[44:28] home. It mean just separate yourself
[44:30] from your worldly associates.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; It says the Holy Spirit
[44:37] &gt;&gt; separates us from the things of the
[44:38] world, from the cares of this world
[44:41] &gt;&gt; and our all affection set on Christ
[44:44] Jesus. Whether we live or die, we serve
[44:47] him and love him.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; And go forward doing all that we can to
[44:51] magnify him unto the people. Now in the
[44:54] day when just at the midnight of
[44:56] Israel's history if you notice king
[44:59] Solomon in the day of Solomon Israel was
[45:01] at its brightest turning then the king
[45:04] of then the then the king of Ahab time
[45:07] of king Ahab it was at his darkest just
[45:10] at the dark time of Israel when Ahab
[45:13] married a little old idol worshipper and
[45:16] brought idolatry into Jewish religion.
[45:19] So did the Holy Ghost church marrying
[45:21] into the world and bringing adultery in
[45:24] the dark ages. Very beautiful type on
[45:26] both churches.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; He says here, you know, boys, I'm
[45:32] telling you tonight, and you young
[45:34] ladies, be careful who you marry. You'll
[45:37] have a broken home the first thing you
[45:39] know. And he's not good to sinners and
[45:42] Christians to marry to
[45:44] to to He's not good to sinners and
[45:47] Christians to marry together. Don't be
[45:50] unequally yolked together. Cuz that's
[45:52] what got Ahab. She was pretty little
[45:56] thing. Yes, paint all over her face,
[45:58] eyes like a lizard. But the thing of it
[46:00] was that did you know what? That's the
[46:02] truth. Ahab just fell for her because
[46:05] she was perhaps pretty because he
[46:07] couldn't have fell for her character
[46:10] because she was a murderer. She was
[46:12] everything else. That's right. And Aab
[46:14] fell for her because she was pretty. And
[46:16] then he got himself infatuated with her
[46:18] and then she just ruled him with a
[46:20] finger.
[46:22] Did you know the wisest man in the Bible
[46:24] outside of Christ died a heathen
[46:27] idoltor because of a bunch of pretty
[46:30] woman Solomon? Pull him away from God.
[46:33] All right. Don't yoke yourself up
[46:35] unequally. And I've seen many people
[46:38] come to the platform and be healed and
[46:40] walk away and mix up with unbelievers
[46:42] and their sickness come right back to
[46:44] them again.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You saw he also says the Bible say
[46:50] when the unclean spirit's gone out of a
[46:52] man when he walks in dry places seeking
[46:54] rest coming and the first thing you know
[46:56] he goes and gets seven other devils and
[47:00] comes back enters in by force. If the
[47:02] good man of the house isn't standing
[47:04] there to w him out he will come in and
[47:06] be worse than he was in the first place.
[47:09] So if you accept your salvation, put the
[47:11] barriers of the blood of Jesus Christ
[47:13] before the door, they can step in that.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; So you see what he's calling us to.
[47:21] Amen. You see how dangerous it can be.
[47:23] You can come and have the blessings of
[47:25] God. You can come and be filled with the
[47:27] spirit and then you can walk right out
[47:29] there
[47:30] &gt;&gt; and then you go up and you and associate
[47:33] with the wrong people, with the wrong
[47:34] crowd, with the things of the world. And
[47:36] then what happened? That spirit had left
[47:38] you now. He's gone to get reinforcements
[47:41] and he's coming back to attack you more
[47:43] worse. So that is why you got to fool
[47:45] yourself up with the things of God.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; God is calling us that to a consecrated
[47:49] life in the hour. Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; God is calling us to a total surrender
[47:54] to a total separation from all unbelief
[47:57] &gt;&gt; because he wants to bless us.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; He wants us to enjoy the blessing that
[48:02] he's planned for us. He's prepared all
[48:04] this just for us. Amen. He's given us
[48:07] his unmmerited favor.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; He's giving us all this redemptive
[48:11] blessing just for us.
[48:14] But what is stopping us is is to totally
[48:17] separate ourselves from it, from the
[48:19] things of this world.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Separate yourself from all worldly
[48:22] pleasure.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Separate yourself from worldly living.
[48:24] Separate yourself from this, from this
[48:27] world, from this flesh. Amen.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; This is the biggest enemy. This is
[48:32] what's keeping you down
[48:33] &gt;&gt; because this one is making you think
[48:35] that this is the real person.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; This is not the real you.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; This is a temporal body
[48:41] &gt;&gt; that was created by mother and father
[48:43] for the real you
[48:44] &gt;&gt; for the spirit man to dwell in it. Amen.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; That's the one that must have the
[48:49] victory. Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; That's the one that got the overcoming
[48:52] power. That's the one that got to bring
[48:54] this under subjection.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Because this one is keeping you for your
[48:59] blessings. But the real you, Amen,
[49:03] &gt;&gt; he wants to serve God. The real you know
[49:06] that he has to align with God. Amen. The
[49:08] real you is crying about has a thirsting
[49:10] for for more and more of God.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; He wants to eat more of the word. But
[49:14] this one is blocking you. So you need to
[49:16] bring this one under subjection. How do
[49:18] you do that? You have to you can't live.
[49:20] You'll be a have a you won't have a
[49:23] victorious life having a prayerless
[49:25] life. You won't have a prayer a
[49:27] victorious life out of the word of God.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to eat. You got to have
[49:32] spiritual food. Amen. You've got to You
[49:35] got to feed that man. Feed that inward
[49:37] man because the one that you feeding
[49:39] more is going to win the battle.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; The one that you feeding more is going
[49:43] to have the victory. Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; You've got to separate from your flesh.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; You got to separate from the things from
[49:48] this man. Amen. This this nature that
[49:51] comes to the fall of man, it comes from
[49:53] the fall. That's why we say we wait the
[49:56] redemption of our bodies. We're waiting
[49:58] for that final part. We want this body
[49:59] to be changed.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Because as long as that body is not
[50:03] changed, it's going to be a war with
[50:05] your soul. Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; So what is God saying to us? Abraham
[50:11] heard it.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; And he moved out. Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; He started to walk. He started to search
[50:17] for that city. Amen. He started to take
[50:20] he started to be obedient to God's word.
[50:22] And it was counted unto him to
[50:24] righteousness
[50:25] &gt;&gt; because he believed it by faith. He
[50:27] believed what God said him.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; He believed it.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; And we must embrace God's word. Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Because right now,
[50:37] there's coming a time where you're not
[50:39] going to enjoy all this time of
[50:40] fellowship together.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; It's going to come through laws and so
[50:44] forth.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; There's little gatherings that we have
[50:46] in here.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; There's little this time right now. We
[50:50] should be gathering more often and
[50:52] filling oursel with the word of God more
[50:53] often. This shirt supposed to be packed
[50:56] up right now.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's supposed to be packed up. It
[50:59] It seems that people need a conversion.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; That's what people need when they have a
[51:04] conversion and really can see life the
[51:07] way the spirit man sees it.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; People are seeing life through the
[51:10] flesh. People are seeing life through
[51:12] their circumstances. They're seeing
[51:13] life. I wake up in the morning. I got to
[51:15] wake up in the morning. I got to go to
[51:16] work. I got to do this. I got to do
[51:18] that. I got to run errands. That's how
[51:20] they see life.
[51:22] But a spiritful man, a man that has a
[51:24] true conversion, he's looking at real
[51:26] life. Amen. He's looking at life through
[51:29] the eyes of God's word.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; He's looking at fulfilling God's purpose
[51:32] for his life.
[51:35] [Music]
[51:39] So he says here
[51:50] he says yoke yourself up with him. Jesus
[51:53] said for my yoke is light and my burdens
[51:56] are easy. Don't be yolked up with the
[51:59] things of the world.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Don't be yolked up in different
[52:02] societies and organization. Yoke
[52:04] yourself singly with the Lord Jesus
[52:07] Christ.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; In order that you can do it, believe and
[52:10] see the resurrection.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; He said,
[52:14] &gt;&gt; "Thank you, Lord.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Do you know that there is still a good
[52:17] thing, young man, to think to think
[52:20] about young woman?"
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I read that. Yeah. Marry someone
[52:26] who is a Christian. Don't marry
[52:28] unbelievers. Yoke yourself not up among
[52:31] unbelievers. Paul said for us not to do
[52:33] that. The scripture is all through for
[52:35] Buddhas for to yoke ourel with
[52:37] unbelievers. But now he's giving you
[52:39] know the balance. Now if you already
[52:41] yoked up with an unbeliever in other
[52:42] words you're already married and he's
[52:44] willing to live with you or she in peace
[52:47] don't leave them. In other words, you
[52:48] both were unbelievers. You got saved and
[52:52] that why now never got saved, but
[52:53] they're willing to live with you as you
[52:55] a Christian. Then don't leave them, but
[52:58] by your lifestyle
[53:00] &gt;&gt; by seeing the change in you
[53:02] &gt;&gt; that can make a difference in their
[53:03] life. Amen.
[53:05] [Music]
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Just remain and live a Christian life
[53:09] that you might win your companion to
[53:11] Christ.
[53:13] Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; You see how the prophet Ali gives a
[53:16] balance there.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Didn't Jesus said if you abide in me and
[53:21] my word in you. Amen. Then ask what you
[53:24] will.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Because you and the word are the same.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has the preeminences. He's got
[53:30] the rulership. You're a prisoner to him.
[53:33] The world is dead.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; You have nothing more. You see the rest
[53:37] of the people living the way they do,
[53:38] but yet you do not do it. You're a
[53:41] prisoner. y my yoke is easy yoke with
[53:44] Christ with his word I do that only
[53:47] which pleases the father and if you can
[53:49] believe that I am me then believe the
[53:51] word so perfect
[53:53] amen
[53:55] now you know the prophet said that every
[53:57] other church the people are just all
[53:59] hypocrites
[54:00] every people that call themselves
[54:02] Christian they're just hypocrites
[54:04] because they don't believe his word amen
[54:06] &gt;&gt; because if they were true if they really
[54:08] love Jesus they'll believe his word
[54:10] &gt;&gt; but they don't believe his word. They
[54:12] don't love his word.
[54:14] Now
[54:16] this is a late friend.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; You can see what is happening around
[54:19] you.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; God don't want us to be yolked up with
[54:23] the things of this world. God God has
[54:26] all these blessings in store for us. He
[54:28] he didn't call us in this message for
[54:30] nothing. He didn't go this entire plan
[54:32] of redemption for nothing.
[54:36] He's already had us in his mind.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; When he's when he's planning this whole
[54:41] plan of redemption, we were all in his
[54:42] thoughts.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; When he's looking at Esther, he's
[54:45] thinking about us.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; When he's looking at Sarah, he's
[54:48] thinking about us.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; When he's looking at perfection in
[54:50] Joseph, he's looking at us. Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; When he's looking at all the Bible
[54:54] characters, he's looking at us.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; So when he called us, he called out to
[55:00] be a blessed people.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now the Holy Ghost is
[55:05] positioning us for blessing because
[55:06] there's a final work to do.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Greater works than these ye
[55:11] shall do."
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; This is that hour that he's been
[55:15] positioning us for.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; This is the hour that all the mechanics
[55:19] that we've been eating through the
[55:20] years. This is the hour where the
[55:23] dynamics takes effect on the mechanics.
[55:25] Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; And now this is the hour when the entire
[55:29] word must be manifested. When you and I
[55:32] walked out of the scripture and become
[55:34] the manifested living word, that what
[55:37] gave Satan a shock
[55:40] &gt;&gt; because Satan thought when this word was
[55:42] being preached and it was just being
[55:44] stored up, he thought how people will
[55:46] believe this things.
[55:48] But through the Holy Ghost, because we
[55:51] had representation, amen,
[55:53] there was a group of people that will
[55:55] receive this word
[55:56] &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell will not prevail
[55:58] against it.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now when Satan is looking at
[56:01] people that is coming up in the image of
[56:04] Christ
[56:08] 2,000 years ago, he saw one in the
[56:09] image.
[56:11] He saw one man. He saw the God man on
[56:13] the earth and he remembered what Adam
[56:15] was. Then he saw Jesus there. Then he
[56:18] saw it through the apostles. Then he
[56:20] went to the dark ages. He thought he got
[56:21] them. Then you had a messenger in every
[56:23] age.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Then there was a man called William
[56:25] Brham in his day splitting in the image
[56:27] of Jesus Christ. so much like Christ
[56:29] that the people mistook him for Jesus
[56:31] Christ.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Now if it happened then now it's
[56:35] happening in a many membered body.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; This is giving Satan convulsions now.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Satan is going hysterical.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; That's why demons are on a rampage upon
[56:45] the earth.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Demons are going hysterical
[56:50] &gt;&gt; doing evil things upon the earth.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Because now sons and daughters of God
[56:56] are being manifested. Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Satan now demon powers, demon spirits
[57:01] that are unleashed on the earth now. And
[57:04] those demons are seeing sons and
[57:06] daughters of God.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; They're seeing images of Jesus Christ
[57:09] popping up
[57:11] &gt;&gt; in the manner of speech, in their walk,
[57:13] in their way of life, in the way they
[57:15] conduct themselves.
[57:18] Because why? In the darkest age,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; when hell is unleashed on the earth,
[57:24] &gt;&gt; he can't believe how a people can do
[57:26] this. Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Because it's not them.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Greater is he
[57:31] &gt;&gt; that is in us.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Than he that is in the world.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; There's one that is in the world. But
[57:38] greater is he that is in us. Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; The one that made us that knew that
[57:43] these people now this will be my temple
[57:45] and I will dwell in them and I will work
[57:48] with them. Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; And I will manifest myself through them.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is the people we were
[57:56] called out to be blessed. We were not
[57:58] called out to be inferior. Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; We are a superior race. Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; We are faith civilization.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; And he's now positionally placing us for
[58:06] a blessing in this land of the Holy
[58:09] Ghost.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; The time when we about to leave the
[58:11] earth.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:20] [Applause]
[58:21] Thank you.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word has come to positionally
[58:27] place us. Amen.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; There must be clear, concise doctrine in
[58:33] every church, in every local assembly.
[58:35] Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; If it's not, then people be tossed to
[58:39] and fro. But God doesn't want his
[58:41] children to be tossed to and fro. He
[58:42] wants them to have stability.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants them to be stable. He
[58:47] wants them to grow. You want them to
[58:49] grow into maturity. Amen. And his word
[58:52] has come. He's got all everything that
[58:54] we have need of. You need healing, his
[58:55] word got it.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; You want whatever blessing you want. You
[58:59] you suffering from depression, the word
[59:01] can deliver you out of that.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you have a need of a job right
[59:06] now, the Holy Ghost is here. He can do
[59:09] that for you.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; You you want a house, the Holy Ghost can
[59:12] give you that.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Everything that you have need of, he can
[59:14] give you.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You want to have,
[59:17] you're saying, Lord,
[59:19] people are saying, "I must have the Holy
[59:21] Ghost."
[59:22] &gt;&gt; And I never had a true conversion. I
[59:25] need to have the Holy Ghost, Lord. He
[59:27] wants to give you the Holy Ghost more
[59:29] than you want it.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; He just want you to reach out to him.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that song. Reach out and
[59:35] touch the Lord. Amen.
[59:41] Reach out
[59:44] and touch the Lord
[59:47] as he passes
[59:51] by.

[1:01:25] afternoon,
[1:01:27] but God knows it.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Each one of us might have different

[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; And God has given us every redemptive
[1:01:51] blessing.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes Lord.
