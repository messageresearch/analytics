[0:04] Let your word
[0:09] belong
[0:11] in the manger of my heart
[0:16] and let
[0:18] me
[0:19] let it shine.
[0:24] Live inside the house of
[0:29] glory every day.
[0:33] Oh, let your word be
[0:37] in the manger
[0:39] of God.
[0:42] Let your word be.
[0:46] your worthy
[0:49] heart

[0:55] and let everything
[0:58] let it shine
[1:03] inside us all day
[1:07] and glory every day.
[1:11] Let your word be born
[1:14] in the manger
[1:17] of
[1:19] my heart.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Father, Lord, we know,
[1:25] Father, you've put your seed word in our
[1:26] hearts, oh God. Father, we thank you for
[1:29] your love, your mercy, your grace. Oh
[1:31] God, we thank you, Lord, that you are
[1:33] heavenly father. You watch over us. You
[1:35] care for us, oh God.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you even now you watch over
[1:39] us, Father. We come into the house of
[1:41] the Lord to worship you, to give you
[1:42] praise, to give you glory, to give you
[1:44] honor. Father, we thank you Lord that
[1:46] you call us into this glorious message.
[1:48] Oh God, thank you Lord that you reveal
[1:50] the truth to us. Oh God, thank you Lord
[1:52] that you open up the eyes of our
[1:53] understanding. Oh God, that Lord, we can
[1:56] be seated together now in heavenly
[1:57] places in Christ Jesus. Oh God, if now
[2:00] father forsaking all others, we sit
[2:02] under the Lord the comfort of your word
[2:04] and we pray Lord that your word will
[2:05] bring comfort to our hearts. Bring a
[2:07] word of faith. Oh God, we know that
[2:09] faith cometh by the hearing of the word.
[2:11] And Lord, we are depending on you even
[2:12] this morning. I pray Lord that you bless
[2:14] the hearer and the listener. Oh God.
[2:16] Father, I pray Lord that you bless the
[2:18] speaker. Oh God. And Lord, may all
[2:20] things be done to glorify your holy
[2:21] name, oh God. And Lord, may no flesh
[2:24] glory in your presence, but may you be
[2:25] glorified in all things, oh God. We love
[2:28] you. We appreciate you. We thank you,
[2:30] Lord, for the bread of life. We thank
[2:31] you for good health, oh God. We commit
[2:33] all things into your mighty hand. We ask
[2:35] your blessings in Jesus name.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38] Amen. I greet you all in the mighty name
[2:40] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[2:42] Amen. Good to be found in the house of
[2:43] the Lord this morning.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And I pray
[2:47] everyone is feeling good in the house of
[2:49] the Lord.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So welcome you all. Amen. I
[2:52] believe Brother Gabriel is here with his
[2:54] mom.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Praise his mom.
[2:58] Yeah. Looks a lot like Sister J. I
[3:00] thought it was Sister J. Praise the
[3:02] Lord. Amen. So Sister Julie, right?
[3:06] Amen. Sister Julie. That's brother
[3:07] Gabriel's mom. Amen. And then we also
[3:10] have, you know, sister Premula. Amen.
[3:12] That we got brother Samir. That's
[3:14] brother Denel's mom. Pastor Denel's mom.
[3:17] Sister Sarah's grandmother. Amen. And
[3:20] these are all related. Gabriel's a
[3:22] cousin. Amen. And that's the aunt. So
[3:26] they're all related. Amen. So we pray
[3:28] they'll be blessed in the presence of
[3:29] the Lord.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Also see our sister there to bless
[3:35] you. May you be blessed in the house of
[3:36] the Lord this morning. Everybody feeling
[3:38] good?
[3:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. You ready for the word of the
[3:41] Lord?
[3:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just speak a few moments.
[3:43] Amen. On
[3:45] &gt;&gt; you saying moments, but these are just
[3:47] moments.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. In his presence. So we'll we'll go
[3:53] to the book of um Mark. Amen. Book of
[3:56] Mark chapter 11. I want to speak this
[3:58] morning.
[4:02] Hallelujah.
[4:08] the season of the spoken word
[4:11] in the hour of perfect faith.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes seasons are opened up to us.
[4:20] But we need to know how to unlock the
[4:23] potential that's laying in that season.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we are unaware of what a season
[4:28] presents to us, the opportunities, then
[4:31] we won't be successful in that
[4:33] particular season.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; So I'm speaking on the season of the
[4:37] spoken word in the hour of perfect
[4:40] faith.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Mark chapter 11,
[4:44] we read from verse 23.
[4:47] For verily I say unto you
[4:51] that whosoever shall say unto this
[4:53] mountain, remember that mountain can be
[4:55] your problem, your circumstance, your
[4:57] sickness, whatever it is, be thou
[4:59] removed,
[5:01] and be thou cast into the sea,
[5:06] and shall not doubt in his heart, but
[5:08] shall believe that those things which he
[5:11] saith shall come to pass, and he shall
[5:14] have whatsoever ever he saith.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ecclesiastes 3 and verse 1. Very
[5:21] popular scripture. Even Mark 11:23 is
[5:23] one of our popular scriptures.
[5:27] Amen. Ecclesiastes 3 and verse1 says to
[5:31] everything,
[5:33] &gt;&gt; there is a season.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Whether it be your health, your wealth,
[5:38] &gt;&gt; your marriage,
[5:40] your job,
[5:42] &gt;&gt; the Bible is recording to everything.
[5:45] Amen.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; There is a season.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; And a time to every purpose under the
[5:52] heaven.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. A time to every purpose under the
[5:56] heaven. Amen. The Lord of blessings
[5:58] through the reading of his word. You may
[5:59] be seated while we continue to read in
[6:01] Exodus chapter 23. Amen.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; The next portion of scripture I'm laying
[6:08] here is to show you that in every
[6:10] season, the angel of the Lord is
[6:12] present.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:14] We know there were three great exodus.
[6:17] The first exodus, God took a natural
[6:20] Israel out of Egypt.
[6:22] Amen.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; The second exodus was when our Lord
[6:26] Jesus came. He established a new
[6:27] covenant. He took them away from the old
[6:29] law and he established a new covenant
[6:31] which was grace. Lord
[6:33] &gt;&gt; and now we're in the third exodus.
[6:35] Praise the Lord. He took us out of every
[6:37] denomination and he set us in heavenly
[6:39] places in Christ.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this is the
[6:44] scriptural backing
[6:46] showing you that behold I send an angel
[6:48] before thee.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; So we are not alone in this journey.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; There's an angel leading us.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The angel of the Lord is here
[6:57] &gt;&gt; to keep thee in the way.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; To bring thee into the place which I
[7:02] have prepared.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; It says, "Beware of him. Obey his voice.
[7:08] Provoke him not, for he will not pardon
[7:10] your transgressions, for my name is in
[7:12] him.
[7:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[7:17] and do all that I speak, then I will be
[7:20] an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
[7:22] adversary unto thine adversaries. For
[7:24] mine angel shall go before thee,
[7:27] &gt;&gt; to bring thee in unto the Amorites,
[7:29] Itites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Evites,
[7:32] Jebusites, and I will cut them off.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are not alone in this
[7:37] journey.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; God is here. Amen. If we are free to
[7:40] believe in him, he will fight our
[7:42] battles.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[7:45] &gt;&gt; you know our Lord Jesus even rebuked the
[7:48] scribes and the Pharisees when they came
[7:50] to him and he says here in in Mark 16:3,
[7:54] he says you can discern and say it'll be
[7:56] foul weather.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Even today they sent out there'll be a
[7:59] level five weather warning for it.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:05] For the sky is red and lowering. He
[8:07] says, "Oh, you hypocrites."
[8:10] You can discern the face of the sky, but
[8:12] you can't discern the signs of the time.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; You can't tell the season.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Proverbs 15:23, it says, "A man
[8:23] had joy, but the answer of his mouth."
[8:28] &gt;&gt; And he watched spoken in due season, how
[8:30] good it is.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when somebody's sick and
[8:36] laying in hospital,
[8:38] a word spoken in due season, don't go
[8:40] telling me you're looking terrible. E,
[8:44] &gt;&gt; tell them you're looking good.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Speak positive words over them.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, people go through
[8:53] depression, they get fat, too. The first
[8:56] thing you see them, you tell them you're
[8:57] getting fat. They're getting more
[8:59] depressed.
[9:01] Praise the Lord. But the Bible is saying
[9:03] the word spoken in due season,
[9:06] &gt;&gt; how good it is.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 15:4 says, "The Lord God
[9:10] had given me the tongue of the learned."
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; That I should know how to speak a word
[9:16] in season to him that is weary.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; And then one more there. I just want to
[9:23] lay one more scripture in Proverbs
[9:24] 25:11. A wordly spoken is like apples of
[9:28] gold in pictures of silver.
[9:30] Amen.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So like we read to everything
[9:34] there's a season. Now we know if we talk
[9:36] about seasons, we go back to the Genesis
[9:39] account and we see in Genesis 1, God
[9:41] said, Amen. the lights in the firmament
[9:44] of the heavens to divide the lights from
[9:46] the night. And he said, "Let them be for
[9:48] signs and for seasons and for days and
[9:51] years,
[9:54] right?" And we know then he set up the
[9:56] sun and the moon.
[9:58] But which one is actually set up for
[10:01] seasons?
[10:05] Is it the sun that's set up for seasons
[10:07] or is it the moon?
[10:08] &gt;&gt; We'll take our answer from Psalm 104:19.
[10:11] He says he appointed the moon for
[10:13] seasons.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Now, we know the sun is typing Jesus
[10:17] Christ.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; And his church is typed as the moon.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; So is actually controlling seasons.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Who's controlling the atmosphere of the
[10:34] age?
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; We ought to be sitting in heavenly
[10:38] places. Amen. To have all things under
[10:40] their feet.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be under the circumstances,
[10:43] BUT WE OUGHT TO BE A PEOPLE OF PERFECT
[10:45] FAITH. THIS IS THE HOUR OF PERFECT
[10:47] FAITH. AND WE OUGHT TO BE SETTING the
[10:49] season and the tone for the hour.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; WE SHOULDN'T BE WONDERING, HEY, WHAT'S
[10:54] HAPPENING? IN THE DENOMINATIONAL WORLD
[10:56] SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE PROGRESSING and
[10:57] they're doing this that and THE OTHER
[10:58] AND THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST IS GOING
[11:01] UNAWARES WONDERING WHAT'S HAPPENING and
[11:03] just saying Lord I don't know what's
[11:05] really happening maybe you should just
[11:07] come and take us away NO BUT THE BRIDE
[11:09] OF JESUS CHRIST KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE she
[11:11] is know she's marching to that step she
[11:14] knows where she is in time and season
[11:17] &gt;&gt; yes Lord
[11:17] &gt;&gt; the prophet says the word is in the
[11:19] bride she knows what he wants done with
[11:21] the word
[11:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[11:25] Praise the Lord. So, I'm just showing
[11:26] you that the moon
[11:28] &gt;&gt; is a type of the bride,
[11:30] &gt;&gt; the wife of the Lord Jesus, and the moon
[11:33] controls times and seasons.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; Now, we also know that a season can't
[11:39] last forever in the natural.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; Now, you're going through seasons in
[11:43] your life.
[11:47] It can't last forever because we know
[11:48] that a natural season lasts
[11:50] approximately for 3 months.
[11:54] And we've got to know how to work in
[11:56] that particular season
[11:58] if we're a farmer. Otherwise, we'll be
[12:01] sowing seeds in the wrong season.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; There are certain seeds designed to
[12:06] prosper in certain seasons.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; You plant a seed. Amen. You get
[12:11] different types of seeds. Right. If if
[12:14] you plant the seed in the wrong season,
[12:16] it that seed the potential will remain
[12:18] dominant.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; The potential in that seed remains
[12:23] dormant.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; And nothing will happen to THE SEED. IT
[12:26] WON'T GERMINATE to life. Now many seeds
[12:29] are adapted to grow in specific seasons
[12:32] and they require seasonal conditions to
[12:34] break docy and thrive. We know they are
[12:36] warm season plants. I'll give you some
[12:38] examples. Tomatoes, basil, corn, beans
[12:41] require warm soil and air temperature to
[12:45] germinate and grow. These are planted in
[12:48] late spring or early summer. Amen. After
[12:50] the danger of winter has passed, cold
[12:53] season plants of spinach, carrots,
[12:55] radish, peas germinate and grow best in
[12:59] cooler weather.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. They can tolerate the the the
[13:03] winter.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Now, gardeners, gardeners and farmers
[13:07] use planting calendars and information
[13:10] about local uh seasons and weather to
[13:14] determine when it is best time to plant
[13:16] their crop. Yes. Yes.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Now we find in our lives if we look all
[13:22] of our lives vary
[13:24] &gt;&gt; and all of us may be going through
[13:25] different seasons
[13:27] &gt;&gt; and some of us may be living life right
[13:29] now based on what transpired in the
[13:31] past.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; We should never live our lives that way.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Because I can't change the past.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; But I can change my present.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; I am equipped right now with the most
[13:44] powerful word
[13:45] &gt;&gt; to change my current situation.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; And my current if I change it now, I can
[13:52] then determine where my future will lead
[13:53] me.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; If I am walking in the paths OF
[13:56] RIGHTEOUSNESS, I DON'T HAVE TO GUESS
[13:58] WHERE this word will take me.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; This word will take me to prosperity.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; This word will take me to my ETERNAL
[14:04] HOME. THIS WORD WILL TAKE ME, AMEN, and
[14:06] lead me all the way to Jesus.
[14:10] Hallelujah.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; So in this time and season, you have
[14:15] within you the potential to break cycles
[14:18] in your life.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; The the opening scripture that we read
[14:24] there, THEY WERE COMING TO JESUS TO ASK
[14:27] HIM, "HOW ARE YOU BEING A MAN?"
[14:29] REMEMBER, they had forgotten that this
[14:31] kind of a man WHO WALKED IN PERFECT
[14:33] FAITH EXISTED.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. for 4,000 years had not seen
[14:37] this kind of a man.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; They saw glimpses of it in Moses.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; They saw GLIMPSES OF IT IN JOSHUA.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; THEY SAW GLIMPSES OF IT IN ELIJAH AND
[14:45] ELISHA.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; BUT TO SEE A MAN WALK IN PERFECT FAITH.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; EARTH DIDN'T KNOW, CREATION DIDN'T KNOW
[14:53] HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS kind of man.
[14:55] Amen.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus called the 12, THEY WERE
[14:57] MARVELING AT THE ABILITY OF JESUS TO BE
[15:00] able to speak TO A TREE THAT WASN'T BE
[15:02] ABLE TO GIVE OFF ITS FRUIT.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; So they come to Jesus and they say, "How
[15:07] are you able to speak to the tree?"
[15:10] &gt;&gt; And now Jesus IS GOING TO UNLOCK A
[15:12] scripture
[15:15] to show how man is supposed to operate
[15:17] in a world of perfect faith.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm guaranteeing you that this is a
[15:22] secret.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that if YOU APPLY IT THE
[15:25] SAME WAY,
[15:26] &gt;&gt; if we put up Mark 11:23, then
[15:30] your results and your mountains will
[15:33] move, not can move, will move.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus now tells them, you want to know
[15:39] how I cursed that fig tree and spoke to
[15:41] it? He says, "Verily I say unto you,
[15:44] whosoever,
[15:45] &gt;&gt; not just the pastor,
[15:47] &gt;&gt; not just the evangelist,
[15:49] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST SOMEBODY CALLED TO MINISTRY,
[15:52] &gt;&gt; but whosoever will believe now,
[15:55] &gt;&gt; if you believe,
[15:57] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen." So, whosoever, so that includes
[16:01] all of us here. Yes.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Shall say
[16:06] &gt;&gt; shall say
[16:08] &gt;&gt; not pray
[16:10] &gt;&gt; because sons of God
[16:13] are speaking in this time.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; It's the hour OF THE SPOKEN WORD.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; THE ORIGINAL SEED THAT WAS SPOKEN IN
[16:19] GENESIS WAS THE SPOKEN WORD.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; We know brother Brandon comes to reveal
[16:23] that to us now that the spoken word was
[16:25] the original seed. Amen.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; So, whosoever shall say to this
[16:30] mountain, your sickness, your problem,
[16:32] your circumstance, your trial, whatever
[16:34] you're going through, your family, your
[16:36] children, your loved ones, whatever it
[16:37] is, speak to it.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Be thou removed.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Tell it what to do.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Are we catching what Jesus is saying?
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Tell your problem what to do. Yeah.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Tell your circumstance what to do.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; BE THOU REMOVED. NOT ONLY THAT, TELL IT
[17:03] WHERE TO GO.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Tell it what to do and where to go.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Be thou REMOVED AND BE CAST INTO THE
[17:10] SEA.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Because even demon powers when they
[17:14] coming out of people, they want to go
[17:16] somewhere.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; They told Jesus, "Don't just leave us
[17:18] floating around in the air,
[17:20] &gt;&gt; but let us go into the pigs."
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus told them what to do and where to
[17:24] go. Yeah.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Shall not doubt. This is our part now.
[17:30] Speak to the situation.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Tell him what to do, where to go.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; And don't doubt.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Now remember, all things are possible.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about spiritual
[17:43] things here.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your day-to-day trials
[17:46] and situations that you're going
[17:47] through. Speak to it.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Speak to the unemployment.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Speak to that sickness. Yes.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Speak to that unbelieving child.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Speak to that addiction.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't just wait for somebody
[18:02] else to pray over it or speak over it.
[18:04] You speak.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; We are raising up an army of believers
[18:08] who have the spoken word in their mouth.
[18:10] It's the right season, but you've got to
[18:12] operate now in perfect faith.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; So he says, don't doubt in your heart.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Don't doubt. BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER
[18:20] YOU'RE SAYING IS going to happen
[18:23] &gt;&gt; and shall believe that those things
[18:24] which he saith shall come to pass and he
[18:28] shall have whatsoever he saith.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Lord thank you.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; You know even in in Proverbs chapter 18
[18:37] there it says death and life are in the
[18:39] power of the tongue.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Now if you're going through a situation
[18:42] and you exalt that situation that's what
[18:44] you're going to have. You're going to
[18:45] have whatever you're saying.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. You go around telling
[18:49] everyone you're unemployed, you're
[18:50] unemployed. That's what you're going to
[18:51] remain.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:59] Speak life over your situation.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; You can't go around. John Ryan didn't go
[19:03] around telling everyone, "I'm blind. I'm
[19:05] blind. I'm blind."
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Even though physically he was blind.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; His confession wasn't extra extra.
[19:14] Praise God. I'm blind.
[19:17] Extra, extra. Praise God, I'm blind.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Extra, extra. Praise God, I'm making
[19:21] ends meet.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Change your prayer. Lord, help me to
[19:29] make ends meet.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; If you got faith to pray and say, "Lord,
[19:36] make me help me make ends meet." Surely
[19:39] you can use that same faith to say,
[19:40] "Lord, help me to have provision for the
[19:42] next six months."
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:44] using the same amount of faith.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Just change what we are speaking.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; You're going to have whatsoever you say.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, whatsoever you say.
[20:00] Now, if you put up Mark 9:23 there,
[20:02] you'll see Jesus is saying all things,
[20:05] not some things.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; To them that believe. Amen.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; If thou can believe, all things are
[20:18] possible to him that believe.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; So maybe maybe you're stuck in a cycle.
[20:28] Maybe your family member is stuck in a
[20:30] cycle.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Maybe you see that things are not
[20:32] working out right for you
[20:33] &gt;&gt; and you seem to be going in the same old
[20:35] pattern. Do you know that trials and and
[20:38] testings come our way because God is
[20:40] molding character? Hallelujah.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; And if we do not learn our lesson or
[20:44] that character is not being molded,
[20:46] &gt;&gt; remember we're going up statue of a
[20:48] perfect man, we're going from faith all
[20:49] the way to love.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Now, if we're coming up with faith, we
[20:53] don't have faith, God's going to keep
[20:54] testing us until we get perfect faith.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; We need virtue. We need temperance.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; We need temperance. We need knowledge.
[21:04] We need patience.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; God's going to keep testing us.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; He's developing character.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; What is this? It's the Holy Ghost
[21:16] virtues in the believer.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; Now we're going through the first
[21:20] situation. Someone stamps your toes. Let
[21:22] the spirit of marim arise.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; We forgetting now that Holy Ghost is in
[21:30] us.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; We want to handle it.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; It's not saying Holy Ghost
[21:37] handle it.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't be handling situations
[21:42] based on human spirit.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; We are governed by the Holy Spirit.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I am saying if you're going
[21:53] through a cycle, it's time that we break
[21:56] that cycle.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; Now remember, there's a difference
[22:02] between child training development. You
[22:06] can't break that and say, "Lord, you are
[22:08] trying to teach me patience. I break
[22:09] that in Jesus name. No,
[22:13] you're going to have to go through your
[22:14] trial
[22:15] &gt;&gt; and until you develop patience, he's
[22:17] going to take you to the next phase.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about cycles in your
[22:23] life, generational curses.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; They tell you it's been all through your
[22:28] lineage. EVERY ONE OF THEM SUFFERED with
[22:30] cancer.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; And nine times out of 10, you are going
[22:35] to end up, "No, I break that
[22:36] generational curse."
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Heart disease is running rampant through
[22:41] your family.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; You ask people how they feel.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Dangerous question.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; People love to tell you how they feel.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; They're feeling under the weather.
[22:52] They're feeling like this. They're
[22:53] feeling down. Instead of saying by the
[22:55] stripes of Jesus, I am healed.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Ah, my my faith is not based on my
[22:59] feelings.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; So, John Wright didn't say, "Praise God,
[23:06] I'm blind." He said, "Praise God, I'm
[23:08] healed."
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Until his body had to obey his
[23:12] confession.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; Keep confessing daily.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Keep confessing. The Bible says, "Pray
[23:18] without ceasing."
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Keep confessing. Thank you, Lord, for
[23:21] provision. Thank you, Lord, for my
[23:23] finances. Thank you, Lord, for my
[23:24] healing. Thank you, Lord, for my wife.
[23:26] Thank you, Lord, for my husband. And
[23:28] thank you, you've already provided for
[23:30] it, Lord.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's time that we can break
[23:38] these cycles. WE CAN BREAK THESE CURSES
[23:41] BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALSO
[23:43] OTHER SPIRITS IN THE WORLD.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; YES.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Spirits of witchcraft,
[23:48] spirit of demon powers,
[23:51] &gt;&gt; all of these countering forces.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Now we should be able to understand that
[23:57] witchcraft cannot prevail over the power
[24:00] of God.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; If we are sons AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD,
[24:04] WITCHCRAFT ARE NOT MORE POWERFUL THAN
[24:06] US.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; God has placed ALL THINGS UNDER OUR
[24:09] FEET.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[24:14] &gt;&gt; people come now with their past.
[24:16] Whatever I've been through in my past,
[24:17] I've been through a traumatic
[24:18] experience.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; I've been through uh gender based
[24:21] violence. I've been through traumatic
[24:23] experience as a child. Amen. I've been
[24:25] through different circumstances in my
[24:26] life. And all of these things are
[24:28] weighing heavy on my spirit. and it's
[24:30] caused trauma in my life that now other
[24:32] relationships that I have, it's having
[24:34] an effect on those relationships.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[24:36] &gt;&gt; we can break that cycle.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; If any man BE IN CHRIST, HE'S A new
[24:43] creation.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; OLD THINGS HAVE PASSED AWAY.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; BEYOND ALL things have become new.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW GOD CAN BRING such peace to
[24:53] our minds?
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. HE CAN CHANGE OUR ENTIRE LIFE. IF
[24:58] YOU'VE NEVER FELT PEACE IN A LONG TIME,
[25:00] WHY DON'T YOU INVITE YOUR LORD JEHOVAH
[25:01] SHALOM to come into your life and say,
[25:03] "Lord, let the peace of God come and
[25:05] settle on me, oh God."
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; We can break curses. We can break cycles
[25:12] in our life. We can break anxiety. We
[25:14] can break depression. We can break
[25:16] worry.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; You know that at one time there was a
[25:21] season of partial faith. WE HAVE NO
[25:23] EXCUSE FOR that now.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. At one time it was A SEASON OF
[25:27] MUSTARD SEED FAITH.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT IN THIS TIME and season. GOD HAS
[25:32] CALLED US TO A GREATER FAITH. GOD HAS
[25:34] RELEASED A GREATER WORD. AND THERE'S A
[25:35] GREATER ANOINTING ON THE EARTH RIGHT
[25:37] NOW.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is not a partial restoration.
[25:42] We are in the fullness of the
[25:43] restoration. Amen. THIS IS THE SEASON OF
[25:46] PERFECT FAITH. AMEN. I WILL RESTORE SAY
[25:49] THE LORD.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; All the young the ONE, THE PL ONE, THE
[25:53] LOCUST. AMEN. AND THE CATERPILLAR HAS
[25:55] HEATED. I WILL RESTORE, SAY THE LORD.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD PROPHESIED IN
[26:00] RESTORATION OF THE BRIDE TREE. HE SAID
[26:02] THE HOUSE OF GOD WILL LIVE AGAIN. THE
[26:04] TREE OF LIFE WILL bloom again. I say the
[26:06] tree of life is blooming RIGHT NOW. THE
[26:08] HEADSTONE HAS COME DOWN. CHRIST IS HERE
[26:11] IN THE MIDST of his people.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will resto the Lord. The problem
[26:17] is the season has changed and people
[26:19] don't recognize it.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; People don't recognize the change in the
[26:23] season. Amen. Amen.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; SO THEY'RE TRYING TO PLANT ANOTHER SEED
[26:25] IN ANOTHER TIME AND SEASON.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T REALIZE THE season has
[26:29] changed.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is not a season of a
[26:32] partial word. The fullness of the word
[26:34] has come. This is not a season of a a
[26:37] partially open word, but the old word is
[26:39] open to us.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will restore, say the Lord. The
[26:44] season of restoration started in the
[26:46] days of Luther.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. The season of
[26:51] restoration started in the days of
[26:53] Luther.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; In the days of Luther, I WILL RESTORE
[26:57] JUSTIFICATION, say the Lord.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that season.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; BUT SOME ARE STILL STUCK IN THAT SEASON.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE CALLED the Lutheran.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; They are still stuck in that season.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; But we are not in that season.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; IN THE TIMELINE OF GOD, THAT SEASON has
[27:16] passed.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But some of them are still
[27:18] planting the seeds of justification,
[27:20] trying to grow an harvest, TRYING TO BE
[27:22] successful in the season of perfect
[27:25] faith.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; But nothing wrong with that season. We
[27:30] also believe in justification.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; It's the first work.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; EVERYONE HAS GOT TO COME to
[27:35] justification. If you don't know what
[27:37] justification is, God has justified us.
[27:40] Yes.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Even though we were guilty, amen, of our
[27:42] past sins and our mistakes through our
[27:44] first birth, God says it's as though you
[27:47] have never done it in the first place.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; Justification goes beyond forgiveness of
[27:51] sins.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Because forgiveness of sins. You did it.
[27:58] You were guilty.
[28:01] I forgive you.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Justification says, "I justify you." And
[28:08] it's as though as you've never done it
[28:10] in the first place.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; So if you've never done it in the first
[28:13] place.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Are we understanding? The prophet says
[28:21] what justification is.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; It's as though you have never done it in
[28:26] the first place.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the season changed
[28:32] from Luther and in the days of Wesley
[28:35] the season of sanctification was
[28:38] released to the church,
[28:40] &gt;&gt; holiness, sanctified life, clean life,
[28:44] &gt;&gt; but still at some still sewing seeds
[28:47] thinking it's still the season of
[28:48] sanctification.
[28:50] The Lutherans will fight the Wesians
[28:54] arguing about what season it is.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:59] But the season has changed.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; It's not the days of sanctification. Yet
[29:04] sanctification is a further work of that
[29:06] step.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; From justification, we moved on to
[29:09] sanctification.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Moving us now into that new
[29:13] birth.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; And in the days of Pentecost, the season
[29:16] changed.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; From 1906, a man by the name of William
[29:21] Seymour.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. M
[29:25] &gt;&gt; the zuza street outpouring
[29:27] &gt;&gt; all that wait now to 1946
[29:32] &gt;&gt; till the angel comes to meet the prophet
[29:33] in the cave.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; There was a season of Pentecost
[29:37] &gt;&gt; going out.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was that? Restoration of the
[29:41] gifts.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God had his prophet
[29:47] being born in 1909,
[29:49] &gt;&gt; growing up in this time and season under
[29:51] that atmosphere
[29:53] &gt;&gt; under that anointing.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:57] We've got to know how to operate in time
[29:58] and season. Remember, God can do things
[30:02] to us that we will regret for the rest
[30:05] of our lives.
[30:07] Time and season came for the prophetic
[30:09] ministry to come in on the scene. And
[30:11] God told the prophet to go down to a
[30:12] group of people. He never knew his world
[30:15] would be rocked in such a way
[30:17] &gt;&gt; by disobeying God and not going to
[30:20] preach those people because he listened
[30:22] to his mother-in-law and that caused the
[30:24] judgment of God to come upon that city
[30:26] &gt;&gt; and he lost his wife and his daughter
[30:32] &gt;&gt; but could he have changed it?
[30:35] &gt;&gt; What would have changed it? Had he gone
[30:37] to those people?
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Choices we make in life.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. We will have to live with the
[30:44] choices we make.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we can't escape it.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Do you know that that really traumatized
[30:53] the prophet? Do you know that the
[30:55] prophet became suicidal?
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet took a gun and he put it to
[30:59] his head. He wanted to blow his brains
[31:01] out because HE FELT THE WEIGHT OF THAT.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Losing his baby, losing his wife.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; One day he's out there. is uh
[31:13] is connecting and disconnecting you know
[31:14] electricity lines
[31:16] &gt;&gt; and he says I took that glove off
[31:18] &gt;&gt; and I had enough
[31:20] &gt;&gt; and I held on to that electricity line
[31:23] and he says nothing happened.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing can defeat the purpose of God
[31:27] for your life.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Nothing shall be able to defeat the
[31:32] purpose of God.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; If God HAS DESIGNED SOMETHING
[31:35] ECCLESIASTES SAYS THERE'S A TIME AND
[31:37] PURPOSE.
[31:39] If your purpose is not done yet, you
[31:41] can't leave the earth.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; God has still GOT A PURPOSE FOR YOU.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Check if your neighbors breathing.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Tell them then you still have purpose.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:59] So that was the days of Pentecost. But
[32:01] then in Revelation 10:7, HE SAYS, "BUT
[32:03] IN the days
[32:05] &gt;&gt; of the voice of the seventh angel,
[32:08] &gt;&gt; the season will change."
[32:10] &gt;&gt; I'M MOVING PAST THE RESTORATION OF THE
[32:12] GIFTS. NOW,
[32:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going TO DO SOMETHING NEW ON THE
[32:14] EARTH.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; All the time, YOU HAD WORD FROM THE
[32:17] EARTH.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; YOU HAD MEN COME WITH RESTORATION, but
[32:23] this time I'm coming with a word from
[32:25] the heavens.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh yes, sir.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; This is not a word from the earth. YEAH.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; THE TITLE DEED that Adam lost in the
[32:32] Garden of Eden, I will bring that title
[32:34] DEED BACK TO THE EARTH
[32:36] &gt;&gt; TO RESTORE MY FALLEN SONS AND DAUGHTERS
[32:38] OF GOD. AND I'M GOING TO BRING BACK THIS
[32:40] TITLE DEED so that you can have dominion
[32:43] over the earth.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; The time AND SEASON IS NOW FOR DOMINION.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you heard me. IT IS NOW
[32:49] THE SEASON OF DOMINION.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; ROMANS 8 SAYS, AMEN. THAT ALL CREATION
[32:54] IS WAITING FOR SONS OF GOD TO STEP INTO
[32:57] that season of dominion.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; We can't REMAIN SILENT.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; WE MUST SPEAK AND GO FORWARD.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise the Lord. Amen. In
[33:09] the days of the voice of the SEVENTH
[33:10] ANGEL, HE SOUNDED and the season changed
[33:13] for the church.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Not only did the SEASON CHANGE. AMEN. WE
[33:16] KNOW THE MYSTERY OF GOD WAS REVEALED
[33:18] which was Christ.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; CHRIST BECAME A REALITY TO US.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery. WE SAW HIM ALL
[33:25] THROUGH THE BIBLE. HE WAS IN MOSES. He
[33:27] was in the prophets. And we saw Christ.
[33:30] Hallelujah. The season changed when the
[33:32] mystery was revealed. The changing
[33:34] season brought a change in position of
[33:36] the bride. Because in the first seal,
[33:38] the season changed.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And now I no longer call
[33:41] you church."
[33:43] &gt;&gt; And because of the change of season,
[33:45] you've got to be able to cope with the
[33:46] season.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; And the effects of the season. Now, in
[33:49] this season, you can't be called CHURCH
[33:51] ANYMORE. I CALL YOU BRIDE.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So each season and releases its
[33:58] own
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Its own qualities, its own
[34:03] characteristics,
[34:04] &gt;&gt; its own potentials.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Now,
[34:11] not only did he change our position to
[34:13] call us, the bride.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; He then married us.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; WE BECAME MARRIED TO THE REVEALED WORD.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; We became married to the open word.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; And he changed our name.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:26] He changed our position first.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Then he changed our name to Mrs. Jesus
[34:30] Christ.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; That name carries authority.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Do you know at one time the the Lord
[34:40] Jesus told the disciples, "Ask anything
[34:42] in my name."
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He told them, "Ask anything in my
[34:47] name."
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Now you walk in the season where it is
[34:50] your name.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Are you getting that?
[34:55] Amen.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; His name has now become your name.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; His name HAS BECOME OUR NAME.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; So when I'm asking in the name of the
[35:09] Lord Jesus Christ, I'm speaking from the
[35:12] position of wife.
[35:13] I'm speaking from the position of
[35:15] sunship authority
[35:17] &gt;&gt; that not only heaven
[35:20] &gt;&gt; recognizes the authority BUT EVEN HELL
[35:22] RECOGNIZES THE AUTHORITY.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; So the season the season changed. NOW DO
[35:28] YOU KNOW WHEN YOU BECOME wife that you
[35:30] you need to be under headship.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; I think we all understand that very
[35:35] well.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; You have to be under headship.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, let's see what the
[35:41] prophet of God says here in what Isaiah
[35:43] 9 and6 meant. We all know that the
[35:45] government shall be upon his shoulder.
[35:47] We've been through this in the year. I
[35:48] just want to hit this highlight, right?
[35:50] To show you that you are not alone.
[35:51] Whatever you're going through right now,
[35:53] you're under the authority of the Lord
[35:54] Jesus Christ.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; He bears responsibility for you.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; And if you feel that your provider is
[36:03] underproviding,
[36:07] &gt;&gt; you can go to him and speak to him.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. But my God doesn't
[36:10] &gt;&gt; underprovide.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; I call it a lack of faith.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Hear what he says now. Isaiah 9:6, "The
[36:20] government shall be upon his shoulder."
[36:22] What does this mean? The answer, the
[36:24] government upon his shoulder come from
[36:26] the wedding ceremony of the east.
[36:28] When the bride is committed to the
[36:30] groom, she takes off a veil and places
[36:32] it over the groom's shoulders. Amen.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Signifying that not only is she under
[36:37] his dominion,
[36:39] that she has transferred her rights to
[36:41] him,
[36:45] &gt;&gt; that he is the head,
[36:48] &gt;&gt; but also that here's what I'm trying to
[36:50] get to now. That he bears
[36:52] responsibility.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; And the care and that he and he alone.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; No one else.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NO OTHER MAN,
[37:05] &gt;&gt; NO OTHER POWER HAS ANY right and
[37:09] responsibility.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Now, I didn't put that in caps. That's
[37:13] how it is written in the books
[37:15] &gt;&gt; for emphasis.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; God sent the Holy Ghost into the church.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; No denominational man system has the
[37:25] right or responsibility over you.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; He alone has responsibility over you.
[37:32] Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; He alone will take care of you.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he says no other
[37:37] man, no other man can shower your wife.
[37:39] Where's the married brothers here?
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Let me see your hands.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you like other men to
[37:47] come shower your wife with gifts.
[37:53] All the brothers are getting very
[37:54] jealous now. They're very angry.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Let me test the others. Let me test it
[37:59] the other way. I don't know if your
[38:00] sisters will receive gifts from other
[38:02] men.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; It depends what it is.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; But it works both ways.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; You don't receive gifts from other men.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] So he's saying no other man, no other
[38:20] power has any right or responsibility.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Right? And that beloved is the key of
[38:25] David. God being sovereign, he forneew
[38:27] by divine decree exactly who would be in
[38:30] his bride.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; He chose
[38:35] she did not choose him.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Woman don't be choosing your men. He
[38:44] chose her.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Otherwise for the rest of your life that
[38:49] man will tell you, I never choose you.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; You came looking for me.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; He chose her. She did not choose him. He
[38:59] called her.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; You know what the problem is?
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Women are by themselves.
[39:08] Now they're sitting with a problem after
[39:09] they married. This woman was here
[39:12] minding own business byself. That man
[39:14] went called her
[39:20] for nothing. They're driving past boy
[39:22] men. I don't know. they're driving past,
[39:24] they'll screech their brakes, they'll
[39:26] slow down, they'll hoot, they'll do all
[39:30] of these kinds of things because now
[39:31] she's sitting with all the problems. Now
[39:33] you're inviting her to come to you with
[39:35] all the problems.
[39:39] Now you're sitting with their problem
[39:41] because you don't find your woman on the
[39:43] street.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; So he says he called her. She did not
[39:51] come on her own. He died for her. He
[39:54] washed her in his own blood. He paid the
[39:56] price for her. She belongs to him and
[39:58] him alone. She's wholly committed to
[40:00] him. And he accepts the obligation.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; He is ahead for Christ is the head of
[40:07] the church. And Sarah called Abraham
[40:09] Lord. Even so, the bride is happy that
[40:12] he is our Lord.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; He speaks and she obeys. That is her
[40:16] delight.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; But have men heed to the truth? Have
[40:20] they esteemed each person who alone has
[40:22] full sovereign authority? So Jesus
[40:26] Christ should have full sovereign
[40:27] authority over our lives. Amen. That's
[40:29] what I'm getting to. And one more point
[40:31] I want to get here. The government upon
[40:32] his shoulders, he says that's a part of
[40:35] his body. That's his earthly strength.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; The God who made the universe, the God
[40:40] who created the heavens and the earth,
[40:42] his earthly strength lies in you.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Are we reading this? What the prophet
[40:49] saying? Amen.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; God's earthly strength is in his word
[40:52] made flesh in his body here on earth.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Now, very quickly, I want to go through
[40:59] this. I told you that he has authority
[41:01] over you and he has responsibility over
[41:03] you.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Don't take my God lightly. God has
[41:06] provided all areas of your life. Let's
[41:08] go through it quickly. As as Jehovah roi
[41:10] or rafa, sorry, Jehovah Jehovah roy, the
[41:14] Lord is my shepherd.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; You'll find that in in Psalm 23. I shall
[41:18] not want. So he's made provision to lead
[41:20] and guide you.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; AS JEHOVAH GYRA, THE LORD IS MY
[41:24] PROVIDER.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Abraham called the name of that place
[41:28] Jehovah Gyra.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So for my physical needs, I call
[41:32] on Jehovah Gyra.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the seven redemptive
[41:36] names are locked up in Jesus.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he's our married
[41:40] husband.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; So he has got to release these
[41:43] redemptive rights to us.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Redemptive blessings.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. as Jehovah Rafa,
[41:49] the Lord my healer.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; So when I'm sick, I am the Lord that
[41:53] health thee.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jehovah Shalom, the Lord my peace.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Ni, the Lord my banner.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Septinu, the Lord my
[42:04] righteousness. And Jehovah Sharma speaks
[42:06] of his presence. The Lord is there for
[42:08] me.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when you are fighting your
[42:12] battles, you are not alone. I'm going to
[42:14] give you two scriptures to show you that
[42:16] God fights your battles for you. And God
[42:18] goes before you to prepare the way for
[42:20] you. You've just got to walk in that
[42:22] authority and know that he is fighting
[42:23] your battles.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; See, in the first Exodus, the Lord is
[42:28] saying, "I will send before thee." They
[42:32] are going to fight a battle. God is
[42:34] sending on before them, which shall
[42:36] drive out the Elite, the Canaanite, the
[42:39] Hittite from before thee. God will send
[42:41] honors to already clear the way.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; God will make your way clear. Somebody
[42:46] receive this. God will make your way
[42:47] clear.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; He'll make your pathway free.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, give me skill and wisdom and
[42:56] understanding to be debtree.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will be be able to
[43:01] awaken that faith within you.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; And he'll be able to get you out of
[43:04] debt.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How? Using who? Don't look
[43:08] to the left. Don't look to the right.
[43:10] Don't look to the front. Don't look to
[43:11] the back. God will use you. God will
[43:13] give you wisdom.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; So God was able now to clear the way by
[43:22] sending ornaments before them.
[43:24] I will not drive them out from before in
[43:27] one year. Lest the land become desolate.
[43:31] See, so now if if men don't inhabit the
[43:33] land, the wild beasts are going to come
[43:36] into the land. So he says here, "Lest
[43:38] the land become desolate and the beast
[43:40] of the field multiply against thee." So
[43:43] God is strategic. He's releasing it to
[43:45] you little by little.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Don't be ungrateful with the provision.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; He's releasing it to you little by
[43:53] little.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "Little by little, I will drive
[43:56] them from before thee until thou be
[43:58] increased
[44:00] &gt;&gt; until you get the capacity to handle it.
[44:02] Yes.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Until you get the necessary staff, until
[44:07] you get the necessary skill to be able
[44:09] to handle it.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; And inherit the land.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; So the land was theirs to inherit, but
[44:20] God is for their own protection is going
[44:21] to release little by little according to
[44:23] the ability in which they able to
[44:25] operate.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go to Joshua 10. Here
[44:32] again, we'll see it came to pass as they
[44:35] fled before Israel and were going down
[44:37] to Bethon, the Lord cast down great
[44:40] stones.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; They're fighting a battle. God says,
[44:44] "You know what? I think you need
[44:45] supernatural assistance."
[44:46] &gt;&gt; God cast down great stones from heaven
[44:49] upon them unto Ezek and they died.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; There were more which died with the
[44:54] hailstones than they which the children
[44:57] of Israel slew with the sword.
[45:00] We don't know. Sometimes we walk
[45:02] unconscious of the supernatural realm
[45:04] and we don't know the amount of uh
[45:07] demons that are being slain through
[45:08] angelic beings clearing the pathway for
[45:11] us.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; That's why David could say, "Though I
[45:14] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[45:15] death, I will fear no evil."
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; For thou art with me.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; When you awaken, Amen. Don't think
[45:23] you're going alone. Yeah,
[45:25] &gt;&gt; beside goodness and mercy that follows
[45:27] you. The angel of the Lord goes before
[45:28] thee.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; You are protected.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; You have divine protection. Don't worry
[45:34] about all of these presidents and
[45:35] things. They got G20. They think they're
[45:37] looking so cool there in their black
[45:40] cars.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Protection services, VIP. They are
[45:45] nothing. Brother Sunny was telling us
[45:47] other day with depreciation, they're not
[45:48] even worth 84 cents.
[45:52] But now because they got some title now
[45:54] they carry themselves out. These old men
[45:58] you see how old they are.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; They got power now. They're meeting G20
[46:04] summit bodyguards protection.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; I have higher detail security detail
[46:09] than them.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; A son of God is higher security detail.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at Elisha.
[46:17] That boy was the the that boy was so
[46:19] concerned. Elisha, how you going to
[46:20] fight off these armies?
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Hey, I got a security detail you can't
[46:23] even see.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; He says, Lord, open the boy's eyes.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Let him see what's encamped around you.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Let him see the oath of army that's
[46:31] encamped around you.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are protected.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; The one who you are married to has
[46:36] protection.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Other people getting shot, other people
[46:43] getting murdered, other people, Amen.
[46:45] things are happening to them. But the
[46:46] Lord is your protection.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is your guide.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Hey, I don't rely on South African
[46:52] economy. If we're going to rely on the
[46:55] South African economy,
[46:57] &gt;&gt; we are going to be living by the South
[46:59] African economy.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; We've got to be living on another
[47:02] economy.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; We got to be living on the economy of
[47:04] heaven.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; That the Lord is my provider.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord provides for me. I am not
[47:09] in lack.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. For those of you that were saying
[47:15] amen, silently, inwardly, you need to
[47:17] say
[47:18] &gt;&gt; amen.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[47:21] &gt;&gt; speak.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; I'm here to open up mute mouths.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; You have the ability to speak.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; But you can't recognize the season.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; So, I'm telling you to speak.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Speak right now. Amen.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've got to be able to
[47:37] speak. OPEN UP YOUR MOUTH. DON'T BE SHY.
[47:39] AMEN. If you CAME TO SOME HIGHRANKING
[47:42] official that told you, "I'll grant you
[47:44] whatever you desire," like maybe Esther,
[47:46] even to half the kingdom,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; you're going to you're going to say,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; when somebody says speak, you speak.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, sometimes you want to
[48:07] help people
[48:09] and maybe a beggar
[48:11] &gt;&gt; and you must see how many excuses
[48:13] they'll try and give you to try and make
[48:14] you give them the least.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Am I right?
[48:18] &gt;&gt; You ask the next beggar how much you
[48:20] need. Hey bro, not too much. You know,
[48:22] they'll tell you a whole lot of story
[48:23] how much they don't need too much. That
[48:24] person probably needs thousands of
[48:26] rands.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; But they'll tell you no nothing, man.
[48:28] Maybe just give me something for some
[48:30] bread.
[48:32] And we don't even give them the amount
[48:33] for the bread. I give them five rand for
[48:35] another 15 rand.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; But when God is saying ask anything,
[48:45] &gt;&gt; don't be shy.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Don't limit God. Do you know your entire
[48:49] family dynamic can change?
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Your family situation can change.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; But you got to afraid to believe it can
[48:56] change.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; You can believe as a parent, my children
[48:59] are serving the Lord.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; My children are walking uprightly before
[49:03] you. Amen.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; My whole family is saved.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; No matter what they are going through,
[49:09] you speak that word over their life.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Situations will work
[49:15] themselves out that they have got to
[49:16] align to whatever you have spoken.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; It may happen little by little, but it
[49:22] is happening.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; That little grain of sand is moving.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[49:30] So we can see that God fights our
[49:32] battles. God goes before us. Amen. We
[49:36] know the disciples, as I'm closing now,
[49:38] the disciples were ordinary men.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came in on the scene and
[49:43] Jesus walked in on the scene, they took
[49:46] note of Jesus.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; There was something within them that
[49:49] recognized, hey,
[49:51] the season is changing.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Who is this man calling us? Can you
[49:57] imagine you're fishing there, minding
[49:58] your own business, someone comes and
[50:00] says, "Come follow me."
[50:05] &gt;&gt; What would you do?
[50:09] &gt;&gt; You're fishing there. You're a wild man.
[50:11] You're a wild fisherman.
[50:15] Amen.
[50:17] And somebody says, "Come follow me."
[50:19] What will you do? These men had
[50:22] something within them
[50:23] &gt;&gt; that heard that voice. Yeah.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; A stranger they will not follow.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Peter left fishing. James and John left
[50:32] fishing.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; They were in a successful business
[50:35] relationship.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; The sons of Zebedee.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; They were all in fish fishing business.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; But they forsake it all to follow Jesus.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; God is calling you today.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Young man, young woman, God is calling
[50:48] you to follow him.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; What choice will you make? You know, God
[50:51] didn't tell them, uh, you know what,
[50:54] you're leaving fishing and all of these
[50:56] things. They didn't bother where their
[50:57] provision was going to come from.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; If I leave a successful fishing business
[51:02] and I follow you, who's going to take
[51:03] care of my family?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Peter was married.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know. It's not I don't know if
[51:13] it's recorded, but I don't know if he
[51:14] had children. He had responsibilities
[51:17] to for them to forsake all of that.
[51:19] Who's going to provide for their needs?
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; But Jehovah Gyro was not locked up in
[51:27] Jesus.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jehovah Rafa was locked up in
[51:33] Jesus.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he could heal the sick.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; When there was time for provision, he
[51:39] didn't say, "Go get a fish. You'll find
[51:42] the tax in its mouth."
[51:44] &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah Gyra.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to be able to unlock what
[51:48] you need from within him.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So these men recognized
[51:53] the they WERE ORDINARY MEN DOING
[51:55] ORDINARY JOBS, LIVING ORDINARY LIVES.
[51:57] BUT ONE DAY AT the changing of the
[51:59] season, they met Jesus. And when they
[52:02] met Jesus, everything changed.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; How many of you can testify this morning
[52:07] when I met Jesus, everything changed in
[52:10] my life?
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The entire life changed. THE
[52:16] ENTIRE PURPOSE CHANGED.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; THE ENTIRE GOALS AND THEIR VISION
[52:20] CHANGED.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; YES.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; And you know when they were looking at
[52:23] Jesus in Matthew Matthew 8:27, the these
[52:27] were the disciples that are speaking now
[52:29] when Jesus now awakes from the ship and
[52:31] he speaks to the winds. The disciples
[52:33] marveled. The men marvel saying, "What
[52:35] manner of man is this that even the
[52:37] winds and the sea obey him?"
[52:39] &gt;&gt; They knew that this is no ordinary man.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; THIS SEASON HAD CHANGED. THERE'S NOW A
[52:45] GOD MAN ON THE EARTH.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says here when the Holy
[52:52] Spirit comes into the heart quickly
[52:54] becomes a two-fold being. So these men
[52:56] move from being ordinary men to
[52:59] following the supernatural.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; One of the earth to die, one of heaven.
[53:07] In his body is subject to death, but in
[53:08] his soul is passed from death unto life.
[53:10] And that's where we are right now.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are supernatural beings.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; We are twofold being. The prophet is
[53:16] saying one of the earth to die, one of
[53:19] heaven. Which one will have a stronger
[53:21] force?
[53:22] &gt;&gt; The one you feed more.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; The one you feed more.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I we need to change our
[53:29] confession. I'm not an earthbound man.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; I am not an earthbound man.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am heaven bound. I am
[53:37] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[53:39] Jesus.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] I'm not waiting to be redeemed. HOW MANY
[53:43] OF YOU ARE WAITING to be redeemed?
[53:45] &gt;&gt; The price of redemption has already been
[53:47] paid.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The title deed of
[53:50] inheritance to the earth has already
[53:52] been given back to man.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not waiting for the title D to come
[53:58] back.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. We can't be reading the Bible
[54:03] and thinking it's a future prophecy.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; I am not waiting for the title D to come
[54:08] back. I am not waiting for Jesus to come
[54:10] out of the sanctuary and go and take the
[54:12] book.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; That has already happened.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; I am not waiting now for Revelation
[54:17] 10:1, the mighty angel to come back to
[54:19] the earth. That has already happened.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; We've got to recognize the season.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The season has passed.
[54:28] I have the title D to the earth. Then if
[54:31] we have the title D to the earth,
[54:33] dominion has been restored.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we have the title D to the
[54:39] earth, dominion has been restored.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; So we walk with dominion authority.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; That's why we can walk into hospital
[54:50] rooms.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Pray.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; And the entire ward get discharged.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; You know the testimony.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; There were there were different
[54:59] ailments, different sickness. All three
[55:01] women, one prayer. Next morning, all
[55:03] three discharged.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Completely healed. Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Pray for a sister with a bone sticking
[55:11] out of her hand.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bone goes back into place. Pain is
[55:15] gone. What is that? Dominion authority.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Doing outreach in the
[55:21] field. The man comes and he says his
[55:23] lungs are finished. They gave him up.
[55:24] They said he's got a few months to live.
[55:26] He's got to live with eight 10 tablets a
[55:28] day.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; One prayer of faith.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The next time you go there, he
[55:34] comes running and he SAYS, "I'M IT
[55:36] WORKED. IT WORKED."
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Completely healed.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Dominion authority.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. HALLELUJAH. GOD BYPASSING
[55:45] PROCEDURES.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; GOD BYPASSING PROCEDURES. PEOPLE
[55:49] BLACKLISTED CAN'T GET VEHICLE FINANCE.
[55:51] GOD CAN BYPASS procedures and they get
[55:53] vehicle finance.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; That's fresh testimonies.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can take you back to the time of
[56:00] Jesus. And I can take you back to the
[56:01] time of the disciples. Those we don't
[56:03] doubt THOSE TESTIMONIES. BUT WE WANT TO
[56:05] SEE HIM THE same yesterday, today, and
[56:07] forever.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; And he's proving himself amongst us.
[56:11] Amen. These are just my testimonies. I
[56:13] can make all of you testify and you can
[56:15] have your own testimonies. Amen. Praying
[56:17] for a baby. Amen. They phone me telling
[56:20] me, Amen. You know that brother
[56:22] Alistister, Amen. His baby said the eyes
[56:24] are rolling back. I said, "Lord, I can't
[56:26] I might not be able to get there in time
[56:28] to that baby." I said, "Send the angel
[56:29] of the Lord before me and touch that
[56:31] baby." By the time I drive from
[56:33] Reservoir to Phoenix, I come there and
[56:35] the baby is already well.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; I asked the parents what happened. They
[56:38] said, "I don't know. The baby just uh
[56:40] came right."
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; They don't know the angel of the Lord
[56:42] going before to heal, to deliver, to set
[56:44] free. What is that? Amen. The power of
[56:46] God.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; You're witnesses here. I'm showing you
[56:50] God in all avenues. healing, miracles,
[56:53] provision, speaking and telling the
[56:55] people, you don't even have to apply for
[56:58] housing finance. The Lord will be able
[56:59] to provide for you.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; You can even buy your property cash.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; And it happened.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Why? People received that word with
[57:06] faith.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; We have many, many testimonies, but this
[57:10] is not a testimony service. This is just
[57:12] showing you the power of God. When we
[57:14] walk with dominion, authority, title
[57:16] deed has been restored back to us, BUT
[57:18] WE CAN BE WALK AWAY OF THE SEASON.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:22] We can walk
[57:24] all things continue the same. All things
[57:27] are NOT THE SAME.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; THEY WILL remain the same if we keep it
[57:30] the same.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; BUT IF WE AWAKEN TO THE POTENTIAL THAT'S
[57:33] LAYING WITHIN US, LORD, YOU'LL send back
[57:35] title to the earth.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; You know, uh we read this last portion.
[57:42] The properties talk about Mary. Amen.
[57:44] And she said the words, "Be it unto me
[57:46] according to thy word."
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; He says in 164 there, you know what Mary
[57:54] said? I WISH WE HAD MORE MARYS.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; The prophet also says the word is in the
[57:59] bride as it was in Mary. Know what TO DO
[58:02] WITH THE WORD.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; NO. IF YOU HANDLE THE SEASON,
[58:05] &gt;&gt; he says, I wish we had more Marys. Amen.
[58:09] Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it
[58:11] according to me, according to thy word.
[58:12] She never questioned. Don't question.
[58:15] You know, even right now while I was
[58:16] giving that testimony, some of you were
[58:17] questioning.
[58:20] That's human tendency.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Some of you are questioning, I wonder if
[58:24] that's real. I wonder if it's true.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Ho, you have little faith.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Stand still and see this morning the
[58:31] salvation of the Lord.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says,
[58:35] &gt;&gt; she never questioned. And another thing,
[58:38] she never wait till she felt the life.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; She didn't wait. She was positive. She
[58:42] didn't wait till she seen something
[58:43] seized by her.
[58:45] She said, "That's good enough." When God
[58:47] says so, that settles it eternally.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Whatever you believe in the Lord for
[58:51] right now, receive it in Jesus name and
[58:53] settle it right now. Settle it right
[58:55] now. The word was good enough FOR HER.
[58:58] DON'T WAIT FOR SOME SENSATION WHILE I'M
[59:00] PREACHING THE WORD. LET THE WORD BE good
[59:01] enough.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Be all the admir of the Lord. OH, SHE
[59:05] STARTED REJOICE OVER IT. SEE, TO START
[59:07] TO REJOICE, NOT WAIT,
[59:09] &gt;&gt; not wait to see some evidence. She had
[59:11] to believe the impossible.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; She had to believe something that never
[59:15] happened. YOU SAY, "CAN IT HAPPEN FOR
[59:16] ME?" Believe the impossible. It shall
[59:19] happen. I prophesy OVER YOU. IT SHALL
[59:21] HAPPEN.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Listen now. The
[59:25] prophet's not finished. She had to
[59:27] believe something that never happened.
[59:28] That's what we have to do.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Believe that you're going to get a job.
[59:33] BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE ALREADY RECEIVED
[59:35] THAT JOB.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. We have to believe for the
[59:39] impossibilities to see new life.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Watch now.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you believe the impossible,
[59:44] if the doctor says you got cancer and
[59:46] you're dying, you've got to believe the
[59:48] impossible to see new life take a hold
[59:50] of you.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; If the doctor says you'll never walk,
[59:55] you've got to believe the impossible to
[59:56] see new life coming to you. New life in
[59:59] them fibers. HOW MANY OF YOU NEED NEW
[1:00:01] LIFE in your fibers?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of your kidneys are damaged.
[1:00:04] Your lungs are damaged. Amen. Amen. Your
[1:00:07] liver is damaged. You need new fibers to
[1:00:09] come in.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:00:29] LUNGS.

[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; NEW STOMACH, whatever it is, I say
[1:00:33] whatever it is right now, ask God for it
[1:00:35] on you. Maybe you mismanaged that organ
[1:00:37] in the past, but say, "Lord, GIVE ME A
[1:00:39] NEW ORGAN. LORD, I WON'T MISMANAGE you
[1:00:42] this time." To them that believe all
[1:00:44] things are possible right now.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Brings forth a new lung, new stomach.
[1:00:50] WHATEVER IT IS, GOD WILL DO IT IF YOU
[1:00:53] TAKE HIM AT his word. Who here will take
[1:00:55] God at his word?
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Who here will take God at his word? Stop
[1:00:59] looking at your bank balance. Amen. Take
[1:01:01] God at his word.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, she had no evidence of it
[1:01:05] at all."
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; He says, "Look, stop a minute. I don't
[1:01:11] preach to everybody. Maybe even right
[1:01:14] now I'm preaching.
[1:01:16] I don't preach to everyone that's living
[1:01:18] right on the highway. I have to go
[1:01:19] sometimes down the lane.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I'm going down the lane to
[1:01:23] pick you up."
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; So, you that are living on the highway,
[1:01:26] don't be judgmental and say, "Why are
[1:01:28] you talking on that?" No, let me go down
[1:01:30] the lane. Let me go to pick somebody up.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:38] You see, how many of you know even Rab
[1:01:41] the island?
[1:01:43] She brought spies. She believed the
[1:01:45] spies words
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; and she became the grandfather, great
[1:01:49] grandmother
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; of King David.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; There's nothing limited with you. Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; There are unlimited possibilities to
[1:02:00] what God can do for you.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus said to them, "If thou canst
[1:02:04] believe, all things are possible." So
[1:02:06] don't go down the path of destruction.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Make good choices in life.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Have a plan. Have a vision for your
[1:02:13] life.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Plan to make the word of God our
[1:02:16] priority.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Plan to make the word of God our
[1:02:21] priority.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Make the word of God our absolute.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. base everything we do around the
[1:02:30] word of God.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Every choice,
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; every decision, base it on the word of
[1:02:35] God.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; If things have not been working out for
[1:02:38] us,
[1:02:40] we can reset our lives
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; by allowing the word of God to guide us
[1:02:44] and lead us.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you've got a failed
[1:02:48] relationship, a failed marriage, a
[1:02:50] failed whatever, failed art, a failed,
[1:02:52] you know, that's I'm just using that
[1:02:54] word failed. Everything is failing.
[1:02:57] God can make it pass.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Because his word will always come to
[1:03:00] pass.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 10:10, "The thief
[1:03:07] cometh not but to steal, to kill, and
[1:03:09] destroy." So if you find in your life,
[1:03:12] your life is going on a downward spiral,
[1:03:15] Satan wants to kill you. He wants to
[1:03:17] steal and destroy you.
[1:03:20] He says, "I am come that they might have
[1:03:23] life and that they may have life, have
[1:03:25] it more abundantly."
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Abundantly. So ask ourselves, is this a
[1:03:31] season where the lamb is taking the book
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; in heaven? Is this a season of the
[1:03:40] mighty angel coming down with the open
[1:03:41] book to the earth? Is this a season of
[1:03:44] the opening of the seven seals?
[1:03:47] Is this the season of taking the book
[1:03:48] and eating the book
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; or is it the season of prophesying
[1:03:54] again?
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; You see, we can be stuck in a season.
[1:03:58] You preach Revelation 10 and the whole
[1:04:00] message community will jump.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Mighty angel came down, but has that
[1:04:04] season passed?
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; And seven thunders already uttered their
[1:04:09] voices.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; As uh the seventh angel already sounded.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So you see, we can be in a
[1:04:15] season.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; But it's evolved.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; It's moved on.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Are we in the season where take the
[1:04:24] book, eat the book?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Or have we already taken the book and
[1:04:28] eaten the book?
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Now we don't know what to do. Sit and
[1:04:31] wonder.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Sit and wonder. When the final
[1:04:37] instruction is prophesy again. Now
[1:04:40] prophesy again requires you opening up
[1:04:42] your mouth and
[1:04:44] speaking.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Speak.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Speak.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Prophesy.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Prophesy over situations. Prophesy over
[1:04:52] things.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Prophesy again.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; The world is waiting to hear your voice.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember we were speaking on
[1:05:02] why did Malachi 4 turn our hearts back?
[1:05:04] We become the voice of God.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; The voice of God. Amen. Let's give the
[1:05:08] Lord a good clap of praise. Let's stand
[1:05:10] together. Amen. Amen. So the season of
[1:05:13] the spoken word, the season of the
[1:05:15] spoken word in the hour of perfect
[1:05:17] faith.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God will withhold no good thing
[1:05:21] from you.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; No good thing would you withhold you
[1:05:25] from you?
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; If a if a natural king told Queen Esther
[1:05:29] even to ask the kingdom,
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; how about the queen of heaven?
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; How about you who's married to the king
[1:05:37] of heaven?
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. He will withhold no good thing
[1:05:41] from you.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And I say be a blessing to others.
[1:05:47] Be a blessing to others.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Speak life to others.
[1:05:52] Hallelujah.
[1:05:54] With your heads bowed, your eyes closed.
[1:05:57] I want you to think back on your life
[1:05:59] now and your journey, the challenges
[1:06:00] you're facing, whatever experience
[1:06:02] you're going through. It's been a cycle
[1:06:04] of sickness, a cycle of problems, a
[1:06:06] cycle. Amen. an unending cycle.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; I believe what we have right now can
[1:06:13] break that cycle.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord,
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; it's a season where all things are
[1:06:20] possible.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; It's a season of the spoken word.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; And this is the hour of perfect faith.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. If thou canst believe
[1:06:34] right now, whatsoever you say to your
[1:06:38] mountain,
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; if you don't doubt in your heart, you
[1:06:43] shall have what you say.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not here as some holy man to speak
[1:06:49] this over your life.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; I'm here to raise an army.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; I'm here to make you speak,
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; over your situation.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. so that you don't doubt and you
[1:07:02] speak over your family and you speak
[1:07:04] over your situation and you watch how
[1:07:06] that situation changes if you can
[1:07:09] believe and don't doubt.
[1:07:11] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe you need new fibers. Maybe
[1:07:17] you need a new organ, a new lung,
[1:07:21] a new arm, a new kidney.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; A new liver.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; The creative power of God is here.
[1:07:29] Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Maybe your eyesight is bad. Maybe you're
[1:07:32] tired of wearing glasses.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother, you're going on a
[1:07:36] slippery slope here. Are you able to
[1:07:38] back up?" I am not here to back up my
[1:07:39] own word. God is here to back up my
[1:07:41] word.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; If Jesus could heal blind men,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; yes.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; What is diminishing eyesight?
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; God can restore your eyesight.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Yes.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; You see, modern science made it easier
[1:07:57] for us to cope with symptoms.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; If we never had the mechanisms to cope
[1:08:02] with symptoms, we would have to believe
[1:08:04] God.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; And take him at his word.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; So, I'm challenging your faith right
[1:08:10] now.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you desire, speak it over
[1:08:14] your life.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Speak it over your situation.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Speak it over your family. Hallelujah.
[1:08:20] If you obey the instruction, oh,
[1:08:24] I wish I could call a few people here.
[1:08:25] The importance of obeying the
[1:08:27] instruction when it's coming from the
[1:08:28] pulpit.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Some of you get excited if you see an
[1:08:33] angel from heaven.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know the prophet says the pastor
[1:08:35] is an angel to the church.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; But you got to be able to respect that
[1:08:41] and receive it.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; You remember though, we read this last
[1:08:45] week. The woman with the issue of blood,
[1:08:47] she contacted the gift of God through
[1:08:49] the son of God.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; And he says he sends his gifts through
[1:08:52] the preachers. But you can contact in
[1:08:54] the same way.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; I'm only here to raise your faith. I'm
[1:08:57] not here to make you look at me as the
[1:08:58] holy man.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not here to make you look at
[1:09:01] me and say, "Lord, come and touch me and
[1:09:02] receive and receive." I'm here to stir
[1:09:04] up the faith within you
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; to say if you say if you say
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; to this mountain be thou removed. You
[1:09:14] know what else it says
[1:09:16] after 11:23
[1:09:19] it says when you're praying forgive.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; He says because that can hinder your
[1:09:24] prayer.
[1:09:25] He says, "If I can't forgive men of
[1:09:27] their sins,
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; I how will my heavenly father
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; forgive me?"
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; If you read the Lord's prayer, it also
[1:09:35] ends with forgiveness.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Because we cut ourselves from blessings
[1:09:40] when we holding these obstacles.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; I call it things that clog the blessing.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; In order for a free flow blessing,
[1:09:48] you've got to follow the principles and
[1:09:50] the laws of God.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:53] Some of you are not receiving healing
[1:09:54] because of unforgiveness.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; You're not receiving that breakthrough,
[1:09:58] that deliverance because of
[1:09:59] unforgiveness.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Some of us are carrying hurt, hatred,
[1:10:04] envy.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; We need to release ourselves from these
[1:10:08] things.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; There's no use asking right now and then
[1:10:11] we have all of these blockages,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; blockages, blockages. You know what
[1:10:16] blockages does to the arteries?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; You find it leads to an art attack. We
[1:10:20] don't want spiritual heart attacks.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; We want to be able to clear all
[1:10:24] blockages now.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Clear all blockages.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to sing a song while
[1:10:29] we preparing our hearts now to speak and
[1:10:32] say, "Father, forgive me of holding
[1:10:35] hurt, pain, past trauma, life
[1:10:39] experiences.
[1:10:40] Forgive me for allowing these things to
[1:10:43] accumulate in my life and build up to a
[1:10:46] point now where it's obstructing me
[1:10:49] receiving what I have need of.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I
[1:10:55] need somebody with faith to join with me
[1:10:57] here because there's spirits here
[1:10:58] working right now.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I need you to raise a level
[1:11:02] of your faith.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; There are people, amen, that need their
[1:11:07] breakthrough. They need deliverance.
[1:11:08] They need to break generational curses.
[1:11:10] They need to break cycles right now in
[1:11:12] their life.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't know how to speak,
[1:11:21] I'm trying to help you out to speak.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Father, Lord, of these past
[1:11:25] hurts, for holding bitterness, holding
[1:11:27] grudges, holding envys, for holding all
[1:11:29] of these things. Lord, Lord, I forgive
[1:11:31] them.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; I forgive them for they know not what
[1:11:35] they do right now. I don't want to
[1:11:36] cutelves off from blessings because of
[1:11:38] that Lord.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Oh father,
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; even on the cross you said father
[1:11:45] forgive them

[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Break it. Release it.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Don't let pride come in the way.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Don't let saying, "Oh no, the next
[1:12:01] person might hear me." No, IT'S BETWEEN
[1:12:03] YOU AND GOD.

[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, the creative power of God is here.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God sitting in the woods
[1:15:36] needed squirrels. Yes.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; He didn't need spiritual squirrels.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; He needed physical squirrels.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; The Lord told him, "What you came here
[1:15:44] to do?" He said, "I came here to hunt."
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Don't go hungry.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; The Lord is concerned. He has he has
[1:15:50] full responsibility over you.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; He didn't want his prophet to go without
[1:15:54] eating squirrels. The prophet was
[1:15:56] feeling for squirrels.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Eat what you feel for.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; I'm using that story to tell you, eat
[1:16:06] what you feel for.
[1:16:08] Because a pro, the Lord refused for the
[1:16:09] prophet to go empty-handed.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "Well, if you want squirrels,
[1:16:13] speak it."
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; He spoke and he says, "Let there come a
[1:16:16] squirrel then."
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Now, when you speak something, you got
[1:16:18] to shoot it, kill it.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; He spoke five times.
[1:16:25] Five times the creative power of God
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; operating through him. Who was it?
[1:16:30] Christ in him.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Christ in you right now. Speak.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

[1:17:11] See what the Lord has done.
[1:17:17] Won't you see what the Lord has done?

[1:17:26] waited for
[1:17:29] has come to pass.

[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, believe it right now. See what the
[1:17:40] Lord has done.

[1:19:20] sing. Amen. We have the song God on the
[1:19:22] mountain. Amen. Let's sing that song.
[1:19:27] People think you know that Syrian army
[1:19:29] said, "Oh no, he's God of the mountain.
[1:19:31] That's why you defeated us. Come fight
[1:19:32] us in the valley."
[1:19:34] You know, they didn't know the god of
[1:19:36] the mountain. He's God of the valley.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] Let's see. Life is easy
[1:19:48] when you're up on the higher
[1:19:54] and you peace your mind
[1:19:59] like you never know.
[1:20:04] Nothing's changing
[1:20:08] when you die in the valley. But don't
[1:20:11] lose faith. But don't lose faith.
[1:20:15] For you're never alone. For you're never
[1:20:18] alone. Let's sing it out now.
[1:20:24] I
[1:20:30] make things go wrong. You make things go
[1:20:33] wrong.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Speak and make them right.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, the God of the good times.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; God of the good.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; He's still God in the bad times.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; The bad times.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; God of the day.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; God of the day.
[1:20:54] to God in the ground.
[1:20:57] You talk of faith. You talk of faith.
[1:21:01] When you're up on the mountain, when
[1:21:03] you're up on the mountain, but talk
[1:21:06] comes easy. But talk comes easy.
[1:21:11] When life's at its best. When life's at
[1:21:13] it.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, sometimes we have joke moments. Now
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; of trials. of tri tempation.
[1:21:24] That's where your faith. That's where
[1:21:27] your faith
[1:21:30] is.
[1:21:33] God the mountain
[1:21:39] is the light.
[1:21:43] The rock is the
[1:21:48] light. He made
[1:21:53] the God of the good times
[1:21:58] is the God in the bad.
[1:22:02] The God of the day
[1:22:07] is the God in the night.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, the moon. The moon has been given to
[1:22:19] control seasons.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; As a church of Jesus Christ,
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; you have control.
[1:22:26] Romans 8 says
[1:22:29] that creation has been waiting for the
[1:22:31] moon to rise to control seasons.
[1:22:37] Hallelujah. Don't be overcome by the
[1:22:39] season. You control the season.
[1:22:43] Don't be overcome by the trial. You
[1:22:44] control the trial. Don't be overcome by
[1:22:47] the temptation. You control the
[1:22:48] temptation.
[1:22:50] When Jesus controlled the temptation of
[1:22:52] Satan, the Bible says he left him for a
[1:22:56] season.
[1:22:58] The enemy left him for a season
[1:23:01] to speak over your life that the next
[1:23:03] season in your life,
[1:23:06] whatever you're going through right now
[1:23:07] will be gone.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus. Every bow, every eyes
[1:23:15] closed. Amen. Even as we prepare to
[1:23:17] dismiss,
[1:23:19] young man,
[1:23:21] young lady,
[1:23:25] God wants to be the Lord of your life.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; You know, if you make him Lord of your
[1:23:32] life,
[1:23:34] you'll be prosperous in all areas of
[1:23:36] your life.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:39] If he is lord of your body,
[1:23:42] he doesn't want to be lord of a sick
[1:23:44] body
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; because he said in his word that by his
[1:23:48] stripes you were healed.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; If he's lord of your finances, he
[1:23:55] doesn't want you to be in lack.
[1:23:58] If he's lord of your job, he doesn't
[1:24:00] want you to be unemployed.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; If he's lord of your marriage,
[1:24:06] he wants to prosper and bless it. Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Whatever area, make him Lord.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Make him Lord over every area of your
[1:24:14] life.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Because when you declare that he is
[1:24:17] Lord,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; he's not a lord of lack.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; He's not a lord of the dead.
[1:24:25] He's God of the living.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Glory be to his name.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:37] Surrender your life to him.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, from this day forward, I turn
[1:24:42] and I give my life to you.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; I surrender my life to you, Father.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; I want to change a season in my life, oh
[1:24:49] God.
[1:24:51] In the hour of perfect faith. Glory be
[1:24:54] to his holy name. Holy, holy, holy is
[1:24:57] the Lord God Almighty.
