[0:00] come on
[0:02] starts with an s
[0:03] and a h
[0:05] and a u
[0:06] it's a shout out
[0:08] amen the shot of the king must be in the
[0:11] camp amen hallelujah so shout out to the
[0:14] lord with the voice of triumph this
[0:16] morning amen
[0:18] what can we say about our father
[0:21] amen he is indescribable
[0:25] amen when we think about our god and our
[0:27] king look at how we work from in the
[0:30] garden of eden from the fall and look at
[0:32] father's love
[0:34] amen and father will never leave us no
[0:37] forsake us
[0:38] our earthly fathers may leave us and
[0:40] forsake us our earthly fathers may not
[0:42] give us the right provision and they may
[0:44] try to the best of the ability but
[0:46] there's nobody knows our needs like our
[0:49] heavenly father
[0:50] amen and he knows how to supply each
[0:54] need amen he knows what his children
[0:56] desires and he gives to us amen
[0:59] abundantly amen god doesn't give to us
[1:02] sparingly he gives to us abundantly so
[1:04] this morning amen we're happy to be in
[1:07] the house of the lord we want to wish
[1:08] every father a happy father's day amen
[1:12] i'm sure you being spoiled by your
[1:13] children and just you having children is
[1:17] a blessing
[1:18] children are an heritage from the lord
[1:21] amen don't look at our children as
[1:23] creeps
[1:25] as annoying
[1:26] children are an heritage from the lord
[1:30] amen they may walk on your nerves now
[1:32] and again but they are your blessing
[1:34] that the lord is bestowed to you
[1:36] and he says nurture this child train
[1:38] this child in the ways of the lord for
[1:41] who knows one of them might be carrying
[1:42] the gospel of peace
[1:44] amen that can sweep the world amen
[1:46] hallelujah and bring deliverance so
[1:49] happy father's day to you i pray you'll
[1:51] have a blessed day amen and even as we
[1:54] uh go into the word amen we welcome you
[1:56] the prevasion
[1:58] amen let's keep my hand welcome in the
[2:00] house of the lord the first time in the
[2:01] service amen good to see brother thomas
[2:03] rahm and his family back
[2:05] in the house of the lord hallelujah
[2:10] bless the name of jesus amen let's turn
[2:12] to john chapter 8.
[2:25] amen at this time we also remember
[2:27] the spiritual father that has left this
[2:29] church for 40 years
[2:31] amen that has gone on to be with the
[2:33] lord
[2:34] amen
[2:35] we know that his efforts have not gone
[2:36] in vain
[2:38] amen but we stand here as products
[2:41] of their ministry
[2:42] amen products
[2:44] that the grace of the lord has bestowed
[2:47] through that ministry amen so sons have
[2:50] been born in the house
[2:51] sons have been risen up in the house
[2:53] amen just one word of scripture here
[2:56] john 8 and verse 36 says if the son
[2:58] therefore shall make you free
[3:01] you shall be free indeed amen we read it
[3:04] one more time amen why don't we all read
[3:07] it together
[3:08] if the son therefore shall make you free
[3:11] you shall be free indeed it's too basic
[3:15] okay you may be seated
[3:17] amen bless the name of jesus
[3:19] hallelujah
[3:27] bless the name of jesus amen
[3:29] amen so this morning we'll speak our
[3:31] freedom as sons and daughters of the
[3:33] most high god
[3:35] amen and for a title my father is a king
[3:39] amen our freedom as sons and daughters
[3:42] and my father is a king
[3:44] amen
[3:46] we're looking at a time
[3:49] and we're going to take this as a type
[3:51] because we know that god made man
[3:54] but man made slaves
[3:57] amen so to contrast our freedom we got
[4:00] to show you the bondage
[4:02] amen that man oppresses another man
[4:07] amen so god made man to be a ruler of
[4:10] the earth
[4:11] but he never put he never ordained it
[4:14] that one man should dominate and enslave
[4:16] another man
[4:18] it was not god's original idea
[4:20] amen but through the fall we find and
[4:23] through the curse you'll see that no one
[4:25] of noah's sons is cursed amen
[4:29] and then you find that
[4:31] and why we can relate to this is because
[4:34] we have also experienced some sort of
[4:37] slavery
[4:41] as the indians we were brought over to
[4:43] this country
[4:44] as slaves
[4:46] to work in the sugarcane fields
[4:51] amen
[4:52] amen now we look at that we're going to
[4:55] look at maybe and take because the
[4:57] prophet used it of the american black
[4:59] man
[5:00] amen
[5:03] so we find that
[5:04] the dutch that were and colonized africa
[5:08] and you know the dutch are the
[5:10] afrikaners
[5:13] and they started when they couldn't have
[5:15] things to trade
[5:17] with the
[5:18] european countries they started to train
[5:21] men
[5:22] they started to trade slaves
[5:24] for goods and products
[5:27] and that's how they value the life
[5:30] of the african man
[5:33] and once they went they were they were
[5:35] captured
[5:37] and it didn't matter they raised their
[5:39] class
[5:42] but whoever they could capture they
[5:43] captured
[5:45] and in one of their one of the
[5:47] captivities that they were taking and
[5:49] they were going to send
[5:51] these people to the land of the usa
[5:54] remember this was around the 1500s now
[5:58] they were traveling by ship
[6:00] and these people were from africa
[6:03] i don't think they ever enslaved anyone
[6:05] from south africa
[6:08] our guys are too lazy
[6:12] so they say they went to northern africa
[6:14] central africa
[6:16] okay
[6:18] now when they when they capture them
[6:21] we're going to focus on this one family
[6:24] here's a royal household
[6:28] and they capture this boy
[6:33] for some reason they didn't recognize
[6:34] his identity amen
[6:37] and they enslaved him
[6:41] they put
[6:43] amen
[6:45] what do they call it shekels upon their
[6:48] hands
[6:48] and they led them to the ships
[6:51] and when they led him to the ships they
[6:53] were never coming back anymore
[6:56] and from that little tribe from that
[6:58] village they captured this boy and his
[7:00] friends
[7:02] amen
[7:04] and now they were just a bunch of slaves
[7:06] and they were weary and they were going
[7:08] away from home and upon boarding the
[7:11] ship they stripped them of their
[7:12] belongings they chained them and they
[7:14] send them below the dicks
[7:18] amen
[7:19] send them below the decks
[7:23] where life would be a nightmare for them
[7:28] amen
[7:29] and they were forced to remain in this
[7:31] condition for months
[7:33] in that journey across the ocean there
[7:35] was no modern transportation
[7:39] amen
[7:40] and many of these captures remember were
[7:42] never at sea before so they started to
[7:44] get seasick
[7:45] they started to develop all kinds of
[7:47] sicknesses and you remember at that time
[7:50] there wasn't modern medicine
[7:52] so they lived in squalor and in filth
[7:55] and they packed the decks of the ships
[7:58] where they were lined up one against the
[8:00] other
[8:01] they cut them to the post
[8:05] amen it was unbelievably hot at the
[8:08] bottom it was crammed it was suffocating
[8:11] conditions and it was in constant
[8:14] darkness below the deck
[8:17] and they had to endure this for months
[8:20] the men were kept separate from the
[8:22] women and children
[8:24] amen and
[8:27] can you imagine how the spirits were
[8:28] crushed
[8:29] those that died they threw them
[8:31] overboard
[8:34] amen if we can maybe just go to that
[8:36] slideshow
[8:38] amen i'm not sure to give you an history
[8:40] lesson but just in that opening remarks
[8:43] i want you to understand that's how we
[8:46] were trapped in denominationalism
[8:48] when that rider came forth in a
[8:50] deception
[8:53] and he took god's people captive
[8:57] so here it is
[9:00] in the length of 360 years between 1500s
[9:03] and 1860s 1860s 12 million africans we
[9:08] have taken forcibly to the americas
[9:11] amen that
[9:15] the largest forced migration in human
[9:17] history
[9:19] so when they went there let's go to the
[9:20] next slide we just go through this
[9:22] quickly
[9:24] it was the trans and athletic atlantic
[9:27] slave trade so it was triangular because
[9:30] of where they took them from in their
[9:32] locations right let's go
[9:40] can we move quicker on these slides
[9:42] remember this is not my message on these
[9:44] people
[9:45] this is my foundation
[9:47] so you see european vessels took goods
[9:50] to africa where they exchanged for
[9:52] slaves can you imagine
[9:54] if somebody comes and give you goods for
[9:56] your child
[10:00] amen the ships then sail to the americas
[10:03] to trade slaves for agricultural
[10:05] products
[10:10] extracted by slave labor which was sold
[10:13] in europe after the return journey
[10:17] so you can't see too clearly but that's
[10:19] the outline of a ship and where you see
[10:21] those little marks those were humans
[10:23] that were stacked like this
[10:25] can you see there's no room for them to
[10:26] move
[10:27] they have to lay in that condition
[10:30] so if they
[10:33] defecated it was right there
[10:36] there was no toilets for them
[10:39] i don't know if you are extremely
[10:41] interested or awfully bored right now
[10:45] because i'm not getting any response
[10:46] from the people
[10:48] amen
[10:49] or i just shocked at the appalling
[10:52] conditions
[10:53] that people had to endure
[10:56] but what i'm trying to do this morning
[10:59] is to show you the appalling condition
[11:01] the church was in
[11:06] amen
[11:07] [Music]
[11:09] let's go to the next one
[11:11] a quarter of the africans brought to
[11:13] north america came from angola that's
[11:16] where they came from
[11:18] angola
[11:19] while an equal percentage arriving later
[11:22] originated from senegambia
[11:25] over 40 percent of africans entered the
[11:27] us through the port city of charleston
[11:30] brother caleb did i get my power cable
[11:32] for the sound
[11:35] amen
[11:46] [Music]
[11:50] let's go
[11:52] next slide
[11:54] so the earlier slaves now remember i'm
[11:56] focusing on this family this tribal
[11:57] family where they took this boy captive
[12:00] and they took them to the south to work
[12:02] in the cotton fields
[12:05] and the earlier slaves in north america
[12:07] worked on plantation along the southern
[12:09] coast cultivating cash crops like rice
[12:12] and tobacco cotton fields
[12:14] amen so they were taken to the cotton
[12:16] fields to be to work as slaves
[12:20] now some of the conditions that they
[12:21] were working as slaves they were whipped
[12:25] they were forced to work
[12:28] amen
[12:30] brother jeffrey before you said i just
[12:31] want to try the same man
[12:36] i don't want to go into it and then we
[12:38] find that
[12:39] it's not working
[12:46] [Music]
[12:51] they were whipped they were beaten
[12:54] amen they were treated cruelly the woman
[12:56] were raped
[13:01] and the children are disowned
[13:08] amen
[13:09] they disowned them
[13:11] and
[13:13] in this
[13:15] time now period that they were living in
[13:16] you got to remember the time
[13:19] we've got to remember that they didn't
[13:21] have the luxuries that we had
[13:24] for them to even make clothing they had
[13:26] to spin cotton to make fabric and all of
[13:28] these things
[13:29] so they use these people
[13:32] in their fields
[13:34] and they didn't want to use the american
[13:36] man
[13:38] because the american man was too high
[13:39] and mighty to work in the fields
[13:42] so they got these africans to come over
[13:44] and work in the fields
[13:46] amen so
[13:48] under these conditions
[13:51] this
[13:52] one
[13:53] family this family that came from this
[13:55] tribe in africa was sold to this
[13:57] plantation worker
[13:59] and he was put in the fields to work
[14:02] and that old tribe was put in the field
[14:04] to work
[14:06] amen and they were all given tasks
[14:11] but this one boy because he came from
[14:13] the household of the king
[14:19] he carried out his work with diligence
[14:23] though enslaved
[14:26] what allowed him
[14:28] to behave in this condition
[14:30] amen
[14:31] what liberated him from all the slavery
[14:34] that was going around him
[14:37] it was the knowledge of who his father
[14:39] was
[14:41] knowing who our father he is would
[14:44] change the atmosphere
[14:46] amen you can take a boy or a girl who's
[14:49] adopted into a family that boy and girl
[14:52] is never settled till he finds his
[14:54] original father and mother
[14:56] the adopted parents can take care of
[14:58] them as best as he can
[15:01] but they are never at peace because
[15:03] there is something yearning inside of
[15:05] him to know his origins
[15:09] that's why we were never settled in
[15:10] genomic nationalism
[15:12] we were always searching
[15:15] never settled in hinduism but always
[15:18] searching because we knew that that was
[15:21] not our father
[15:23] we were searching amen and if you take
[15:26] this even this boy when you take us we
[15:28] trace our lineage back
[15:31] you gotta go past india
[15:34] come on now
[15:36] if you have to trace your lineage back
[15:38] you gotta go past india
[15:40] yeah yes
[15:42] you gotta go past if this boy was gonna
[15:44] trace himself back he was gonna go past
[15:47] angola
[15:48] and if he started the journey to trace
[15:50] his ancestors and to trace his
[15:52] generations you and i if you both
[15:55] started in that journey both of us would
[15:57] have ended at noaa
[16:00] amen
[16:02] hallelujah but that's not where we were
[16:04] going to stop amen if you go seven
[16:06] generations earlier both of us would
[16:09] have arrived at adam
[16:12] amen but that's not where we originated
[16:16] because we gotta go past adam
[16:19] we gotta go back to the eternities amen
[16:22] where we were taken from the back part
[16:23] of god's mind amen the sea gene of god
[16:27] where we were predestinated and to be
[16:30] unto the adoption of sounds
[16:32] into the back path so you can't even
[16:34] trace our heritage and our existence to
[16:37] genesis only you gotta go past genesis
[16:41] amen
[16:42] amen hallelujah
[16:45] now there's nobody on the earth that can
[16:47] trace the lineage like the believers the
[16:50] bride of jesus christ can trace it
[16:52] amen you find man in the efforts to
[16:55] trace themselves they go and look at an
[16:57] ape
[16:58] or a chimpanzee
[17:00] oh my ancestor
[17:03] yes because his father is the serpent
[17:07] that is why science is proclaiming hey
[17:10] we evolved from eggs yes you did
[17:13] but not me
[17:14] i was created in the image of god amen
[17:18] hallelujah i'm in his image and i'm in
[17:21] his likeness
[17:23] in fact when god looked at me he said
[17:26] hey you are very good amen yes amen
[17:30] amen and after god made man he said you
[17:33] know what my work is complete and it
[17:35] took a whole day to rest
[17:38] so pleased he was with his creation
[17:42] amen
[17:44] so this because this boy knew his
[17:46] identity
[17:48] it changed his thinking in the field
[17:51] brother branham says they didn't have to
[17:53] whip him
[17:56] he just carried out his duties
[18:00] even though the other boys that were
[18:01] taken from his tribe were around him and
[18:03] they were getting whipped and they were
[18:04] getting beaten
[18:07] amen
[18:09] so one day brother branham says he says
[18:11] it was not too far down south from where
[18:13] he was and he knew this this farmer
[18:15] there or this uh
[18:17] owner of this field
[18:19] and he was releasing a story and he said
[18:22] now they were training remember we were
[18:23] talking about how they were trading
[18:24] human beings
[18:26] so now this guy had come to buy another
[18:28] slave for himself
[18:29] he comes into the field
[18:31] and he walks around and he's looking at
[18:33] all now they would want somebody young
[18:37] somebody strong
[18:38] somebody that they can use in the field
[18:40] not somebody feeble and that's what god
[18:43] wants god doesn't want feeble christians
[18:46] god wants rugged christians amen god
[18:48] wants soldiers in the gospel that he can
[18:51] use
[18:53] amen not up one day and down the next
[18:56] day and depressed and sad
[18:59] amen but somebody on fire for god
[19:03] somebody that's not afraid to say lord
[19:05] use me for your glory
[19:08] amen
[19:10] head on
[19:12] amen have we got some of them here this
[19:14] morning say amen hallelujah
[19:18] oh bless the name of jesus it doesn't
[19:20] matter amen if nobody is looking it
[19:22] doesn't matter that you are not getting
[19:24] the accolades but keep pressing on
[19:27] holding up the standard of the kingdom
[19:29] high amen
[19:31] you may be just a mother at home and you
[19:34] may be thinking nobody is taking notice
[19:36] of you i want to speak to the woman a
[19:38] little bit even though it's father's day
[19:41] there's nothing as powerful as a woman
[19:45] a godly woman who can pray amen who can
[19:48] pray for family pray for her husband
[19:51] amen say lord i do not know what demon
[19:54] powers out there along today's journey

[20:36] the children but shout out to god this
[20:38] morning with the voice of triumph
[20:42] hallelujah
[20:44] amen or coming and acting all too many
[20:46] damn quiet in the house of the lord amen
[20:49] but you've got a boisterous voice

[21:03] powerful force to be reckoned with amen

[21:22] not women of complaints amen and woman
[21:25] of murmuring hallelujah but holy women
[21:28] of god sacred woman of god holding the
[21:32] virtues of the message of the hour amen

[22:02] oh bless the name of jesus amen don't
[22:04] care now if nobody was looking at this
[22:06] boy in the field but he was shoulders
[22:09] upright
[22:11] walking in the field amen doing his work
[22:13] amen picking the cotton amen doing it
[22:17] like he was doing it for his father
[22:19] himself
[22:22] amen hallelujah amen and we find amen
[22:26] that
[22:27] it was during this time that some of the
[22:30] most beautiful songs were perfect
[22:32] because from an experience of pain comes
[22:35] forth beautiful things
[22:38] and that is why the lord tells us that
[22:40] in his own time he makes all things
[22:43] beautiful
[22:45] you'll find the best paintings the best
[22:47] sculptures the best songs that were
[22:49] written you find the person who wrote it
[22:51] he came from a deep emotional pain and
[22:55] experience
[22:57] that caused him to pin if we wink
[23:01] the ocean filled
[23:04] with the skies
[23:06] of parchment made
[23:08] and i believe he was in a mental asylum
[23:11] they found it written on the walls
[23:15] the love of god
[23:18] he found the love of god
[23:21] amen even the man that was running the
[23:23] ships
[23:25] newton
[23:26] pinned amazing grace
[23:29] how sweet the sound
[23:32] save the wrench
[23:34] like me
[23:36] amen amen
[23:39] when he saw how he was treating those
[23:41] people
[23:42] something spoke to his heart
[23:44] and he said that's not right
[23:48] amen and it's one of the most sound
[23:50] beloved hymns amazing grace
[23:53] amen
[23:56] the slaves the captured slaves used
[23:58] these songs i remember they couldn't
[24:00] communicate to one another in the normal
[24:03] way they were planning escapes
[24:06] they wanted to run away they wanted
[24:08] freedom
[24:10] remember we're speaking about our
[24:12] freedom as sons and daughters
[24:15] and our title is my father is a king
[24:20] they desperately wanted to get out of
[24:22] this bondage
[24:25] because at once they were once free
[24:27] people
[24:29] my mind is cast this morning to
[24:31] malachi chapter four five and six
[24:34] and i've seen so many posters
[24:37] for father's day
[24:38] and they got the scripture father's day
[24:40] celebration service in every
[24:42] denominational church
[24:44] and they're using elijah
[24:46] the prophet they're using malachi 4
[24:49] verse 5 and 6 and they're using
[24:51] in verse 6 you'll find it
[24:54] he used they love this one here
[24:57] you know where it says fathers to
[24:59] children and out of children to father
[25:02] but they're missing an important part
[25:04] who's going to turn it
[25:06] who's the heat
[25:08] that's not
[25:12] god amen
[25:15] why are they using the scripture
[25:18] if you go back you find out who that he
[25:20] is
[25:21] he says i god is going to send elijah
[25:24] the prophet
[25:25] before the great the coming of the great
[25:28] and dreadful day of the lord that's this
[25:30] day
[25:33] and he enlightened the prophet
[25:36] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[25:38] the children
[25:40] so who are they referencing with this
[25:42] they're ignoring all the other parts
[25:44] because that word says father there
[25:45] because they search now father's day
[25:47] message hey this is it looks like a nice
[25:49] scripture let's see
[25:50] so all your broken homes your father
[25:53] your children are going to be turned
[25:54] back to your fathers and the father's
[25:55] hearts are going to be turned back to
[25:56] the children lying demons
[25:59] do not have the revelation of the
[26:01] scripture
[26:02] repent and receive elijah the prophet
[26:04] and he shall turn your hearts
[26:08] amen
[26:10] amen
[26:12] hallelujah
[26:13] so because they have to talk in cold
[26:15] language they've started to sing
[26:17] spirituals
[26:19] amen
[26:20] like
[26:21] wade in the water
[26:25] hallelujah
[26:27] they started to sing you know negro
[26:29] spirituals
[26:30] they started to sing these songs and it
[26:33] was cold
[26:34] wade in the water means if you if you're
[26:37] running and you flee
[26:39] run in the water
[26:40] so they can't see your tracks
[26:43] and they started to use songs about the
[26:45] exodus because
[26:48] these captive the people who held them
[26:50] captive made them christians so they
[26:52] learnt about moses and the egyptians
[26:55] so they started to sing about that
[26:57] captivity and they started to use it in
[27:00] code language in these songs
[27:02] amen hallelujah
[27:06] hallelujah they started to sing to one
[27:08] another
[27:10] oh
[27:11] songs amen hallelujah some of you may
[27:14] never hear this but i want you to hear
[27:16] it
[27:17] amen
[27:20] [Music]
[27:22] so if you're too lazy you go home and
[27:23] you put youtube for every other thing
[27:28] [Music]
[27:35] wait
[27:36] in the water
[27:39] gods are gonna trouble
[27:42] the water
[27:44] isn't that beautiful
[27:45] why are they walking in the cotton
[27:46] fields
[27:48] [Music]
[27:57] is
[27:58] [Music]
[28:12] amen
[28:14] while they're walking in the cotton
[28:15] fields they were desiring their freedom
[28:19] freedom
[28:24] freedom
[28:25] can you imagine their bondage and their
[28:27] singing for freedom
[28:31] [Music]
[28:41] i'll be buried
[28:52] [Music]
[28:56] because before we be a slave to this
[28:58] mark of the beast
[29:00] we'll be buried in our grave
[29:02] because we will not bow down we will not
[29:04] bear
[29:05] amen
[29:06] hallelujah
[29:08] amen
[29:09] we are going to hold our freedom
[29:11] they can kill us if they want
[29:14] but before we become slaves to the
[29:15] system we'd rather be buried in the
[29:18] grave
[29:19] death is an early exit from this life
[29:22] amen hallelujah
[29:24] people want the quickest exit
[29:26] death is the quickest exit
[29:28] it's an open door the bible says
[29:31] amen
[29:33] hallelujah
[29:34] and they should sing amen i want you to
[29:36] hear this why are they chopping
[29:38] [Music]
[29:46] [Music]
[30:02] [Music]
[30:05] i wanna lie down i'm just showing you
[30:07] these things amen hallelujah and they
[30:09] used to sing amen
[30:14] [Music]
[30:35] but we'll never understand that because
[30:37] maybe our forefathers would understand
[30:39] it
[30:41] but for us
[30:44] you're wondering why this pastor is
[30:45] playing old songs for you this morning
[30:48] but when it comes to the deep experience
[30:50] of pain
[30:52] when you're in bondage
[30:55] you're brothers that have come from
[30:56] denomination
[30:58] and now that you're worshiping in the
[31:00] message of the hour
[31:01] you would know the difference in the
[31:03] freedom of worship
[31:06] amen amen the chains that once held you
[31:08] bound do not hold you bound anymore
[31:12] but you are free
[31:13] amen hallelujah
[31:16] oh bless the name of jesus and the other
[31:19] song that we sing they used to sing
[31:21] swing low
[31:24] sweet chariot
[31:26] coming forth to carry me home
[31:30] amen so these were songs that were
[31:32] birthed
[31:33] from
[31:35] slavery
[31:37] out of the deep pain
[31:39] amen
[31:41] until god arose a man in the
[31:44] 1800s yes sir 100 years before william
[31:48] branham
[31:49] became a man to liberate man from
[31:52] natural slavery
[31:54] and a hundred years later
[31:56] god sent
[31:57] elijah the prophet to liberate man from
[32:00] spiritual slavery
[32:02] amen amen
[32:05] amen
[32:07] and you if you read the story of abraham
[32:09] lincoln it's quite a story i'm not going
[32:11] to go into it but you find how he
[32:13] persisted
[32:14] and though he failed at many attempts at
[32:16] being the president he persisted
[32:19] until he became the president
[32:21] and one of the greatest thing ever
[32:23] signed into law was the proclamation of
[32:26] emancipation
[32:31] let's put that slider amen i want you to
[32:33] see this
[32:34] let's see if you can pick it up
[32:36] amen
[32:38] yeah the one before that
[32:40] president abraham lincoln
[32:42] issued
[32:43] the emancipation proclamation on january
[32:46] 1st 1863
[32:51] and 100 years later
[32:53] in 1963
[32:56] came another proclamation
[32:58] of emancipation
[33:03] amen
[33:04] the proclamation declared that all
[33:06] persons there are the slaves within the
[33:08] rebellious states
[33:10] ah and ends forward shall be
[33:14] free
[33:15] now we would think that
[33:17] the proclamation of
[33:19] emancipation would have set all slaves
[33:22] free
[33:23] but not so
[33:26] because they didn't have modern
[33:28] technology like you and i
[33:30] right
[33:32] so the slaves that were working in the
[33:33] field didn't get word that there was an
[33:35] emancipation order
[33:38] the slave owners held back the truth
[33:40] from them
[33:43] denominations held back the truth yes
[33:46] amen
[33:48] amen
[33:49] because created dogmas chain the people
[33:54] that's what brother branham was up
[33:55] against
[33:57] every time he presented the light of the
[33:59] scripture according to the revelation of
[34:01] the hour they took it back to their
[34:04] creed and they were bound by the queen
[34:08] the shackles of the creed and dogma and
[34:11] what their people had been teaching them
[34:14] held them bound
[34:17] and they refused to let go of their
[34:19] teaching
[34:21] and see the light of the open book
[34:25] amen
[34:27] so
[34:28] that didn't free all the slaves only a
[34:31] small number of the country's 4 million
[34:34] slaves were freed immediately
[34:37] amen
[34:40] you will find here's what it says
[34:42] despite the expansive wording the
[34:44] emancipation proclamation was limited in
[34:47] many ways
[34:48] it applied to states that had separated
[34:51] from the union
[34:54] the message of the hour applied to only
[34:56] those that were out of the system
[35:00] that were out of the denominational
[35:01] system
[35:04] it's not that slight it's the next line
[35:08] amen
[35:10] it says here
[35:11] upon leaving
[35:13] it says it applied to states that had
[35:16] separated from the union there was only
[35:18] a few people that left denominations
[35:21] amen
[35:22] leaving slavery untouched in the loyal
[35:25] borders it also expressed exempted parts
[35:28] of the confederacy that had already come
[35:31] under northern control
[35:34] hallelujah
[35:37] amen
[35:40] i don't think you got that
[35:44] there were some states that had come
[35:45] under the northern control
[35:49] and we were already under the northern
[35:51] control because on the sides of the norm
[35:55] there's a king over the city
[35:58] amen there's a king amen hallelujah and
[36:01] now
[36:02] but words started to get around
[36:05] and as they started to understand that
[36:07] the president had signed into order that
[36:09] they could go free
[36:11] more and more of them started to escape
[36:13] and
[36:14] when they knew that sometimes they
[36:16] approached the ranch only and they told
[36:18] them and they knew it was law for them
[36:20] to release them but they told them that
[36:22] at sunrise you can go
[36:24] so what they started to do they started
[36:27] to climb the hill
[36:29] because they didn't want to wait for the
[36:32] sun to come over the mountain
[36:35] so amen hallelujah
[36:38] brother branham says they were climb up
[36:39] a hill
[36:41] amen they were going to be free at
[36:43] sunrise some could climb a little higher
[36:46] than others
[36:48] oh praise the lord
[36:50] they were not set free of paul's day at
[36:52] irena's day at martin's day
[36:56] at luna's day at wesley's day
[36:58] some couldn't climb all the way up to
[37:00] the pyramid
[37:02] amen to see the coming sun to see the
[37:05] rising sun
[37:07] amen hallelujah but you could climb
[37:10] higher
[37:11] amen hallelujah brother branham is
[37:14] saying sam could climb a little higher
[37:16] than the others the older ones couldn't
[37:18] get up yes
[37:20] amen hallelujah paul showed you the
[37:22] mystery but we have seen the shout
[37:25] out
[37:26] amen hallelujah paul wrote about the
[37:28] shot but we are in the shout
[37:31] amen so the ones that got the highest
[37:34] just as soon as they saw the sun peeped
[37:36] up
[37:38] amen glory hallelujah he said we
[37:43] are
[37:44] free
[37:45] amen so the ones amen they started to
[37:48] haul it down to the next group
[37:52] amen
[37:53] hallelujah
[37:55] they started to haul it down to the
[37:57] people that were at the bottom that they
[37:59] had seen the sun and the next one
[38:01] holiday we are free on down the hill
[38:04] passing down the news we are free and
[38:07] every man that sees the sun is free
[38:11] amen amen amen hallelujah
[38:15] amen so we came climbing up amen and our
[38:18] lord jesus amen he climbed above every
[38:21] mountain he climbed above every grave he
[38:23] climbed through the air he climbed
[38:25] beyond the moon beyond the sun he went
[38:28] to another dimension amen and he took
[38:31] that book from the hand of the original
[38:34] owner and he said amen i have come to
[38:37] set my people free and even then
[38:40] revelation 5 they are all wondering and
[38:43] trouble you can see that they are
[38:45] enslaved
[38:51] doesn't revelation 5 sound like they
[38:53] enslaved there's no freedom in their
[38:55] worship right because the strong angel
[38:58] says who is worthy to open the book
[39:01] and they say there is none found worthy
[39:05] we have got a proclamation of
[39:08] emancipation
[39:11] but it is unsigned
[39:17] but they came forth the lamb
[39:20] and it's stripping with blood yes
[39:23] the lamb was dripping with blood
[39:28] he walked forth to the original owner
[39:31] and he signed it with his blood amen
[39:34] amen when he came out of that sanctuary
[39:37] it took that original amen document of
[39:40] our title deed and he signed it with his
[39:43] blood
[39:44] pardon amen
[39:47] hallelujah then heaven must get to work
[39:49] amen hallelujah because the seals have
[39:52] now been broken and the names that were
[39:54] beneath the seals had to be revealed
[39:58] amen and it's not just good enough for
[40:01] the seals to be broken in heaven because
[40:04] that title deed is for man on the earth
[40:07] so god sends a mighty angel down amen in
[40:11] revelation 10 he comes descending
[40:14] amen from heaven clothed with a cloud
[40:18] put up that picture brother caleb amen
[40:20] there's some here may not know what that
[40:22] picture looks like amen but here it is
[40:25] in 1963
[40:27] our emancipation proclamation
[40:31] and it wasn't done in silence
[40:33] yes sir
[40:34] hallelujah
[40:36] it wasn't done in silence
[40:39] oh praise the lord the bible recorded
[40:42] that when he spoke he wrote like a lion
[40:46] stand it
[40:49] amen
[40:50] yes amen you go read when they when the
[40:52] cloud appeared
[40:54] they said it was like a sonic boom
[40:58] brother branham describes this great
[40:59] blast
[41:01] god was not silent about it
[41:04] they just rejected what he did
[41:05] [Music]
[41:10] amen anytime god's gonna do something on
[41:12] the earth he proclaimed it in the
[41:14] heavens first
[41:15] amen
[41:16] so down comes the mighty angel with the
[41:19] proclamation of emancipation that you
[41:22] can go free amen
[41:24] amen hallelujah and you're gonna hide it
[41:27] inside of you so he asks you to take it
[41:30] and consume it
[41:35] amen you are freedom that's why we
[41:38] should be the happiest bunch of people
[41:40] here there should be people struggling
[41:42] around this place drinking the spirit of
[41:44] god worshiping god because for the first
[41:47] time there's a group of people that are
[41:50] free to worship him
[41:52] amen because he will the son of man is
[41:54] set free is free indeed
[41:57] oh say praise the lord
[41:59] amen hallelujah amen so jesus went above
[42:03] every principality and he ascended above
[42:05] every power he climbed the highest
[42:08] mountain he met and then one day at the
[42:11] rising of the sun in fact it was in the
[42:14] message at the rising of the sun that
[42:16] brother branham comes to announce to the
[42:18] people turn the picture to the right
[42:23] amen turn it to the right
[42:27] oh
[42:28] you
[42:28] skeptic because you the skeptic never
[42:31] saw the picture this way
[42:34] they were viewing it the other way
[42:37] brother branham went and orchestrated
[42:38] and told the jet to go and fly over that
[42:41] place
[42:42] and try to form this thing
[42:44] and also when you cameraman when you're
[42:46] taking it take it the other way
[42:49] so one day 1965 when i'm preaching it is
[42:51] the rising of the sun i'll tell them
[42:53] turn it to the right
[42:56] then he was a brilliant mastermind
[42:58] that he really was a master of all
[43:00] circumstances
[43:02] amen
[43:03] [Music]
[43:05] so we got a new we've got a word for you
[43:07] skeptic shut up
[43:10] amen but he came and he said turn the
[43:13] picture to the right
[43:16] amen and he said can you see his eyes
[43:19] amen he said he's appearing right now
[43:23] hallelujah what is he bringing a message
[43:26] coming forth
[43:27] a message to gather the living saints
[43:30] not kept saying say man together living
[43:32] saying say man
[43:34] to tell you who your father is
[43:37] to tell you that you are not from this
[43:39] world
[43:40] amen hallelujah you may not get along
[43:43] with your earthly father and mother amen
[43:45] but you need to get along with your
[43:47] heavenly father
[43:49] amen god will change your spirit god
[43:51] will change and you give you a new heart
[43:53] amen
[43:54] hallelujah where the holy spirit in you
[43:57] can get along with everybody no matter
[43:59] what they do to you whether they
[44:01] prosecute you whether they'll forsake
[44:03] you whether they say all manner of
[44:05] things against you the holy spirit
[44:07] within you will make you get along with
[44:10] everybody
[44:12] amen that's right amen amen hallelujah
[44:16] in fact one time now we're talking about
[44:18] the proclamation that went forth to
[44:20] sound that they were free but then we
[44:22] had some johnny crows
[44:25] and in this farm now they captured a
[44:27] little crow because the farmer said i'm
[44:29] going to show these clothes a lesson
[44:30] they're coming to destroy my crop
[44:32] so he caught one of the crows
[44:35] and he tied it to a post
[44:37] and the crow could fly away
[44:40] so every time the other crows saw this
[44:41] guy trapped jail
[44:43] they stayed away from the field
[44:47] amen
[44:50] and all the other crows will fly over
[44:52] and say come on johnny crow let's go
[44:54] south the storm and winter is coming
[44:57] and johnny crow would try to crawl and
[44:59] he could not he's tired so one day there
[45:02] was a kind of person going by he says oh
[45:05] poor crow lying dead half starved to
[45:07] death amen couldn't hardly get up he
[45:10] said i felt sorry for that poor bird so
[45:12] he goes over and he cuts the band and
[45:15] lets the crow loose
[45:18] but he's been bound so long till he
[45:20] thought he was tired
[45:22] because every time he tried to run and
[45:24] take off that string pulled him back
[45:27] and he became so conditioned that he
[45:29] knew exactly where to go before he could
[45:32] feel the joke of that string
[45:35] and he never even though the band was
[45:37] cut he never dared to go past that mark
[45:43] amen
[45:46] and the crows would go hollering amen
[45:48] and say come on johnny crow it's winter
[45:51] time let's go south and johnny would say
[45:54] i can't
[45:55] because i'm bound
[46:01] every time you go past them and you tell
[46:03] them
[46:04] acts 2 38 baptism they say i can't
[46:08] matthew 28 yeah
[46:14] amen
[46:16] every time you show them elijah the
[46:18] prophet they tell you the prophets were
[46:20] unto john
[46:22] they lie
[46:24] you know what they like
[46:26] if they saying
[46:27] that the prophets were unto john
[46:29] who was jesus
[46:31] was he not a prophet
[46:33] yes
[46:34] amen
[46:36] didn't the bible say the lord himself
[46:37] will raise a prophet like unto moses
[46:40] was that referencing jesus
[46:43] you see these lying demons
[46:44] [Music]
[46:47] jesus won't contradict himself
[46:52] amen
[46:54] so you tell him i'm bound
[46:56] but he was free yet he didn't know that
[46:58] he was free
[47:00] maybe the shame here this morning that
[47:02] don't know that you are free that you
[47:04] can sow into the heavenlies and you can
[47:06] live above the level that you are living
[47:08] right now you can sow into the blessings
[47:10] of the lamb amen into the blessings of
[47:13] the holy spirit maybe you're living a
[47:15] life of dehydration and life amen will
[47:18] your malnutrition but in the land of the
[47:20] holy ghost
[47:22] amen amen is life more abundant
[47:26] amen hallelujah so we ask you to come up
[47:28] a little higher this morning amen and
[47:31] when he had got through reading amen
[47:34] now the prophet is saying here he's
[47:35] typing jesus now and he says yeah when
[47:38] jesus had finished reading the scripture
[47:40] you remember they gave him the scroll he
[47:42] says this day the scripture is fulfilled
[47:45] in your years
[47:46] he says you see it for he was giving
[47:48] forth the warning of the coming forth of
[47:50] the great gasher of pentecost to sit at
[47:54] liberty everyone that was slaves to sin
[47:57] and bound
[47:58] now at the going forth of this jubilee
[48:00] here
[48:01] remember jesus said i've come to
[48:03] proclaim the acceptable here the
[48:05] acceptable year is the jubilee year it
[48:07] was to be sounded throughout all the
[48:09] lands a trumpet was to sound and this
[48:11] trumpet would make a distinction
[48:14] the trumpet was the 50th year sound
[48:17] and every slave that had been bought or
[48:19] become poor could not care for his own
[48:22] he had fell beneath the load and his
[48:25] master his death he had bought him and
[48:27] placed him into the field as a slave and
[48:29] he had to serve him for he was too poor
[48:32] to redeem himself now the prophet says
[48:35] remember you are one time slaves
[48:37] yourself and down in egypt and i have
[48:39] freed you therefore at the sounding of
[48:41] the trumpet every slave no matter how
[48:44] long you've been in or how short a time
[48:47] is that liberty to return to his family
[48:53] you are at liberty to return because
[48:56] malachi 4 has come he has come to turn
[48:58] you back to your family at pentecost
[49:03] amen hallelujah
[49:07] if
[49:08] pentecost had to be resurrected i'm
[49:10] talking about peter and the disciples
[49:12] and the people that were caught up in
[49:13] the upper room
[49:15] some of us would be offended that they
[49:16] worship
[49:18] some of us would think they had a bunch
[49:20] of radicals
[49:22] an emotional worker
[49:24] but these men were not drunk
[49:27] they were filled with the holy ghost
[49:30] when you sit in the in the seat of the
[49:32] scornful and in the seat of the critic
[49:34] like brother branham did one time
[49:37] but when he said what has she got that i
[49:40] don't have
[49:41] and then he said before he knows it his
[49:43] foot started tapping
[49:46] don't try to stop the tapping off your
[49:48] foot
[49:50] when you feel the spirit move
[49:52] let the spirit move
[49:54] don't care what the person next to me
[49:56] might say
[49:57] you tell them give me a little space can
[50:00] i get a little social distancing so that
[50:02] i can praise my god amen

[51:15] proclamation of emancipation
[51:18] he says our parents sold us out
[51:21] yes they did
[51:24] our parents sold us out
[51:27] not our parents now

[51:30] gone on jf rollins

[51:37] what's his name
[51:39] fred roberts
[51:42] someone who's scared to mention his name

[51:53] amen
[51:54] your true father
[51:56] is the holy spirit
[51:58] amen
[51:59] he says here our parents sold us out to
[52:02] sin amen we are laden under the bonds of
[52:05] sin as a slave to sin we were born in
[52:08] sin shaped in inquity came into the
[52:11] world speaking lies there nothing we can
[52:13] do to help ourselves
[52:14] because our own makeup our own nature
[52:17] everything we are is sin
[52:19] he says but when jubilee time come
[52:21] that we are free
[52:25] amen
[52:26] and the trumpet is the gospel the good
[52:28] news the trumpet was the gospel then
[52:31] good news you are no longer bound you no

[52:58] good christian page is
[53:01] dead
[53:02] amen
[53:06] the old emancipation or proclamation is
[53:08] then signed
[53:10] and you are free so when a man hears the
[53:12] good news christ died in your stead
[53:14] nothing you can do about it christ paid
[53:16] the price the gospel sounds you can drop
[53:19] every cigarette

[53:51] steal you don't have to be weary why you
[53:54] got the resources of yonder that's never
[53:56] been tapped of the bountiful blessings
[53:59] of god that the world knows nothing
[54:01] about
[54:03] you say i must have a little pleasure
[54:05] why brother if you ever hear the good
[54:07] news of the trumpet the worldly
[54:09] pleasures seem so little that's a
[54:11] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol you
[54:14] don't need it no more
[54:16] so much greater is this news than the
[54:19] whole boundaries of slavery the old
[54:21] marks of sin that caused you to be petty
[54:25] i wretched by smoking cigarettes
[54:27] alcoholics on the streets with trembling
[54:30] you don't have to be that way the gospel
[54:33] trumpet is astounding whosoever will let
[54:36] him come and drink from the waters or
[54:38] fountains of life now this is where
[54:40] we're getting to here now
[54:42] so
[54:44] not everyone accepted
[54:46] the gospel trumpet sound
[54:48] and the prophet says to reject that
[54:50] if a man says i want to stay the way i
[54:52] am i don't want to go i just want to
[54:55] stay right here so even in the in the
[54:57] field he was a slave he says that man
[54:59] was taken to the temple with his slave
[55:01] master
[55:02] he must put his here against a post and
[55:05] all was brought in his hair
[55:08] and it was a sign that he could never be
[55:10] free
[55:11] amen
[55:12] he had to serve his master as long as he
[55:14] lived because he rejected the news of
[55:17] the good news
[55:19] if that isn't a perfect type of the
[55:21] marking of the beast
[55:23] the good news is the gospel to reject to
[55:26] hear the gospel your ears is sealed up
[55:30] that you always call it fanaticism and
[55:33] there's nothing to it and you'll be
[55:34] serving sin in forms of godliness as
[55:37] long as you live no matter how religious
[55:39] you are you are sealed off from the
[55:42] presence of god
[55:46] he says the emancipation of proclamation
[55:48] has been signed you are free you just
[55:50] don't know it
[55:51] amen
[55:53] hallelujah
[55:54] you the son of man is set free
[55:57] is free
[55:58] indeed let's read proof of his
[56:00] resurrection in closing
[56:03] in the message proof of his resurrection
[56:06] pitch 1955-0410
[56:09] paragraph 20
[56:13] everybody feeling okay everybody free in
[56:16] the house of the lord
[56:18] amen hallelujah
[56:21] it says now man
[56:22] in his candle condition
[56:24] in his mental conceptions
[56:27] he has always pulled himself away from
[56:29] god it's been since the beginning that
[56:32] man longs to see the other side
[56:35] but he's been bound in a prison house
[56:37] sometimes traditions of man puts him
[56:39] there
[56:40] that they teach traditions of different
[56:42] forms and motives of how to worship
[56:46] and he puts men under bondage
[56:48] under in his tradition
[56:50] and that's been since the world began
[56:52] it's been that way and he is shut up in
[56:55] the prison houses
[56:57] but man always has long to see the other
[57:00] side
[57:01] and any little thing that looks a little
[57:03] supernatural that human being will run
[57:06] for it
[57:07] to see how they flock for these meetings
[57:12] he says anything that looks like the
[57:13] supernatural
[57:16] the human side will run for it
[57:18] because it's some sort of promise across
[57:21] the border just across the lane but what
[57:24] makes him do that is because he is
[57:27] created in the image of his maker
[57:29] almighty god he is created to be a
[57:32] worshiper of god and he must find some
[57:34] place to give an outlet to that feeling
[57:39] so don't suppress the feeling
[57:42] if you feel like shouting hallelujah
[57:46] you shout hallelujah
[57:48] amen because god has set you free
[57:52] god liberated us and this is the freedom
[57:55] we have as sons and daughters of god

[58:28] want to get up you want me to continue
[58:30] preaching an all-night meeting amen
[58:33] hallelujah but when the spirit of the
[58:35] lord is here amen he breaks every yoke
[58:38] of bondage he breaks the yoke of fear
[58:41] amen hallelujah he breaks the yoke of
[58:44] depression mental oppression
[58:47] amen
[58:48] hallelujah
[58:50] don't walk out of this place bound
[58:53] walk out of this place like that slave
[58:56] son
