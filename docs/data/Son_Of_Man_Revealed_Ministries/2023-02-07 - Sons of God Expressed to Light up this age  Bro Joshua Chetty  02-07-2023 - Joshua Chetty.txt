from above and come down from the Father of Lights amen thank you Lord room is no variableness neither shadow of turning of his own words began he us with the word of Truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures amen amen amen amen 1 John 1 5. into the book of 1 John 1 5. this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light amen and in him is no Darkness at all amen thank you if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleansed us from all sin amen before you sit with one more scripture John 10 10 the book of Saint John James baby the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that day might have life and they This Is Us now might have it more abundantly amen amen not speaking about everything abundantly he's saying he wants them to have it more abundantly amen amen you may be seated women for a thought this morning we're going to speak of sons of God Express to light up this age amen amen Son of God expressed to light up this age and this is the age we know of gross Darkness yeah this is the age where the property is drawing the seven Church ages putting up the when he's preaching on the seven Church angels He showed that this was the age that was completely blackened out amen amen but by faith he put that light there yeah yeah because he knew that he's preaching a message for a special kind of people amen amen amen amen a message that will attract a special kind of people yes and these people will become lights will become the light of the siege they will light up this age amen they will light up the darkness of the sage because remember God is the father of Lights amen so we are sons of God that we must Express lights yes amen and no and the only people on the Earth right now to express light is you and I amen because you're walking in the midst of Darkness amen so if you are not expressing lights then you are part of Darkness yes but if you are part of but if you are a son of God and if he's the Father of Lights then you must Express His Image amen because there's no Darkness yes enemies light amen amen and if we are fellowship with him the Bible says and we work in doctors we lie and do not the truths but if you walk in the light and ease the lights we have Fellowship one with another and now we have received light through the word that come in our day amen amen Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my part and the word that we have received has ignited us it gives us a light amen amen and wherever we're walking we're walking with the word in US embedding us amen because it's no longer Christ God above us there was a time where it was gone above us there was a time where to be God with us but we are walking an hour with God in us God in us we have to express the image of God in us and if we're expressing God in us we are expressing light amen and John 14 12 says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do amen because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son and if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you ain't love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter amen that he may be with you forever even the spirit of truths whom the world cannot receive because it said him not neither knoweth him but they know him for he dwelleth would you and shall be in you amen hallelujah thank you I will not leave you comfortable I will come to you yet a little while and the world see at me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and Yea in me and I in you amen amen this is our way is coming to Union with us amen this is a sweet Union where now we understand what Jesus was talking about he said the eye and the Father the father and me and I in you amen so you know this Union through this Union we know that Christ come and dwell in US amen he's the one that is leading us he's the one that's guiding us amen amen that's why in John Jensen it says the thief cometh not but for to steal yes and to kill yeah and to destroy but I am come that they might have life and they might have it more abundantly amen so we're speaking about Son of God Express to light up this age and for the subtitle we're speaking about equipped to lead a super Abundant Life amen you know what that now more abundance amen something that's more abundant is super abundance amen so we have been equipped to leave the super Abundant Life I don't believe that Christ wants us to be a living a life that is defeated amen amen well aware that the enemy what the enemy tactics are he's well aware that enemy will come and steal amen he's well aware that the enemy will come and destroy yes you will come and kill thank you but he has come to equipas amen thank you he's come to guide us through this age amen amen that's why he said Greater Works than these they shall do yeah because now he knew that they were coming our way he's going to dwell in a many-membered body yes amen he knew that he had to come and dwell in the midst of a people amen and express himself amen and he says Greater Works than these they shall do because he's dwelling in us he's doing the works through us he's continuing the work there must be you see Christ's Adam stops his work when he left he poured out the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost gave birth to the church and in every age God has called up the people he's been a continuity amen until now we've come and we're reaching the climax now amen where is fulfilling all that he said he will do Darkness become our now when the world is in a certain condition amen that's right maybe 10 10 years ago 20 years ago you wouldn't you would you would say no it's just people talking like that but now it's what I'm talking about is sudden condition where Sodom is around you yes amen 100 amen that even now people who do not have this word know there's something wrong yeah know that there's something wrong with mankind yes because we are living in such a an age where sin is become so legalized yeah yeah amen because they crossed the dividing line and when you cross the dividing line you will sin and continue to sin and have no remorse for sin yeah you will think that you're just going on and you're carrying on and you don't feel nothing about it and that's the time we're living now amen that's the darkness upon the Earth yes and that's why God had to preserve sons and daughters and that's why when the prophet when he's putting up that light day in the midst of Darkness under seven Church age he did it by faith amen knowing that there had to be a people upon the Earth Ephesians 1 3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ with blessed us with all spiritual blessing in every places in Christ amen according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that he should be that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein it made us accepted in the Beloved amen now as a son and daughter of God each one of other to be tried and tested we are to come on the tutors amen amen and the childrenize the Holy Ghost working through the faithful Ministry bringing the word getting the equipping the people building them up amen amen brought on the tutors giving you the word equipping you so when you take that word and now when the word becomes when you apply that word in your life there's a practical application of that word amen and now you are growing in faith you are growing in stature growing through the statue of a perfect man amen and as you are growing as you are being equipped you are coming now to be ready to be adopted son and daughter of God Amen where you can say now oh no you have the right you have now rightful claims over all that is given to you yes you are always wasn't it amen that can never be taken away from you but you had to come to a mature State yes you have to come to an efficient Church a mature church that can take that all the spiritual blessings that is given unto you so now you can live that super Abundant Life amen that's why he's equipping you to look that super Abundant Life amen amen he says now you've been tried you've been tested every son and daughter of God must go to that theory trial and you must be tried you must be tested you might feel weighed down sometimes but God is taking you to that process is refining you he's bringing out the best in you amen yes because he already got his he already got confidence in you because the gene of God is laying in you yes amen amen do you have eternal life it means you're already you ought to always have eternal life yeah amen you always you have to be part of God yes and he's eternal life amen amen so all the all the attributes of God is nature his divine nature the Bible says we are particles of is divine nature all those attributes were laying in you amen therefore when you're walking in his age yes you can't be walking like every other person amen you can't be walking gloomy you can't be walking down when everyone is negative amen amen just a quick testimony on the on a Sunday night we had a vibrant lovely service there and uh at the combined meeting yes yes and we were and we take the word as Believers we take the word amen and we apply we take it to ourselves but there must come a time where we have to apply the word yeah right so we we digest we eat the word right but in your life there must be a practical application of it so walking on Monday morning to work and I meet a brother and then I saw the brothers greeted him and I continue because I was in a conversation with other people and then as they left and the brother was not far from me then I just went to hug the Brethren and greet him and then we started talking and then I think something obviously it was led by the Lord for me to make sure I go back and you know breathe the Breather properly and talk to him and the brother was despondent because some people testified some false things about him false things about him so the brother came he said I might need your help for certain things I said no no you don't need my help the Lord has already done the work I said the battle is the Lords amen and it was preached on Sunday night these things were preached on Sunday nights I just took that word and I applied it I said I don't want to claim to to have the battle the battle is the Lord amen the Victory Is Ours amen I said now the Lord has done the work these people that come against you the Lord will deal with it he will deal with it you will walk in the victory amen I said in that word by the time I left the brother you were so encouraged he was bubbling up by the end of the day the people that come against this brother by the end of the day I got news that something was going to happen to them because of what they did you see what happens when you mess with the children of God Amen the battle is the Lord amen and the Victory is ours we're not just taking this word and we're just listening to the word becoming years of the word only but there must be a practical application of the world you must apply the word in your daily life yes this word is this word is real amen this word is more real than you see the things around you because everything here you're seeing around you is temporal amen amen but this is an eternal substance amen amen the very word that you're living in is all temporal amen this world this word comes from an eternal Source amen amen this word has eternal life amen thank you the problem of God says in the message things there are to be in paragraph 32. he says now the only way that you can be a son a daughter of God because you have to be you have to have eternal life and there's only only one form of eternal life and that God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you have to be in him always the gene of your life yes yes spiritual life tonight was in God Amen the father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God now you expressed after his word is coming to you yes to do what to light up this age if there ever been a Dark Age as this age amen gross Darkness upon the Earth you are the expressing God's life in you because you are his son and or daughter of God yes therefore you get what I mean amen you are now made amen you're sitting in this church night because your duty is to express God to this nation yes and in this people and in this neighborhood and where you associate that's your duty amen your place in the season yes God placed you positionally in this season and it's your duty to express him amen then Jesus when he come on the earth when he was founded in the temple and when Mary and Joseph realized that he was God gone and missing and they realized that they had to go back and fetch him and they said your father Mary saying your father's looking for you yes he has the word correcting the area he said don't you know I'm about to I'm I have to be about my father's business amen amen and that's what every one of us have to do if you are a son of God you have to be about your father's birthday amen that's what we put here on Earth we are going to our workplaces we're going to our school life we're going to our University life we bring our daily lives our whatever we're doing those are things that we put here to get by to get by in this life but the wherever God placed us we have to be about his business no matter where we are go to a place that in positionally places in different places so that we can be about his business and wherever we are we are equipped to have a but a super Abundant Life so you can light up that place where you are yes light up that University light up that school yeah light up that workplace and because of you they can be blessed wasn't that expressed in the life of Joseph everywhere that Joseph walked in prosperous Joseph was typing perfection and this is the hour of perfection where Christ is now coming to his bride to perfect his bride amen and everywhere that Joseph walked he had to prosper no matter where it was when he was in 45 you had to prosper in a dungeon where he was right there in the prison you still had to prosper one of them had to come to the Pharaoh amen so wherever you walk the your company can prosper because of you yes your company may not realize that that's right but because of your presence day you're carrying that anointing amen amen you're a gene of God your son and daughter of God you are carrying that blessing with you amen and the fact that they got you there they're going to enjoy that blessing you don't believe that let's look at the type in the Bible when the ark was taken out of the children of Israel and it was it was dwelling you with the with the either Nation they was being blessed because of the haq yeah look I said listen yeah we look at how they are rejoicing because that we need to get back the ark amen amen see if you are watching another brother everyone else rejoicing then ask yourself the question am I in the words yes amen whoever I stepped out of the word because all the blessings are laying in there amen amen everything that God wants you to be blessed with is laying in there yeah but the minute you step out of the word and you find that now the problems are coming in because now you need to go and check yourself up amen yeah but you might say I'm going to this situation I'm here to death but every son and daughter has to also be tried okay also have to be tested they also have to have the job experience these things Don't Come Easy just they don't do not come without a training ground there should be a training ground amen we've got it you have to be squeezed amen to get the best out of you amen for you to be perfected you have to be squeezed all those dressed and to be squeezed out you have to be tried in the fire amen amen you have to face the fury trials you don't think when you come into Christ it's going to be a bit of roses no but God has equipped you amen amen is equipped you to overcome the age you bring the Thorns your way his body has given you the overcoming power amen and though the Devil Comes the Bible says resist the devil and he shall flee so he says yeah now you express after his word is coming you to light up the sage you are the expressing God's life in you because you're a son and daughter of God therefore you get what I mean you are now made you stand you're sitting in church tonight because your duty is to express God this nation and his people his neighborhood where you associate wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes of his or his attributes you have to be if you ever if you got eternal life then it always was eternal life yes and God before there was a foundation was knew that you would be here and when the word or the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father you are citizen of the king not citizens but you are children yes amen we don't want to just be citizens we want to be children in a kingdom you've got a king and you got your citizens but you also got is and he is you have to come from his loins amen hallelujah amen if you want to to be an heir you have to come from the loins of the father amen so but you are children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that eternal life dwells in you amen and there was a time when he was just God above us amen there was a time when it was God with us but a son and daughter of God must have God in us yes amen amen one John 4 4 says Yea are children of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you amen do we not just speak of that now God dwelling in US amen greater is he that is in you then he that is in the world man they are of the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world you are with them we are gone he that know what God you're in us he that is not of God your word not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error amen so you don't have to be afraid of the answers of the enemy yes amen because greater is he that is in you amen then he that is in the world yeah the one that dwelling in the midst of you right now the one that possessing people those demon powers that are possessing mankind yes the one that's in the world the world Cosmos amen amen the one around you the evil world the God of this evil age possessing the people but great is he that is in you they are walking in darkness but you you are walking lights amen because you are having fellowship with him yes amen and he is the father of light amen and if you have fellowship with him then you must ask Express lights yes sir so no matter how dark the situation is no matter how gloomy the situation is you might walk into a negative situation but you can express life yeah hallelujah amen amen your company might be doing bad but you are lights you can express light yeah it might be a dark hour for your company amen it might be a darkest hour for your family member yeah but in the darkest hour then Jesus came yes and now the Jesus is coming through you and I amen amen he's walking throughout our hands with our legs amen amen you've got to put it back to you because Jesus is walking in his body amen hallelujah amen come on Luke 12 48 says for to whomsoever much is given of aim shall much be required amen amen so this is not an easy walk amen this this is talking about a surrendered walk it's a work that we have to keep doing introspection it's the time where you have to keep yourself in check yeah it's a time it's an hour away You're gonna work out your own salvation with fear and trembling because why so much is given to you amen you you see to to to to walk in the super abundance there's a responsibility a lot of people don't want that responsibility yeah yeah you find that even in the Earthly Kingdom you find like you've got a father who's a king and you might find it once they know I don't want that responsibility so he wants to now abdicates their responsibility amen and that's the only way you can come out of it now we are Sons and Daughters of God Amen we are born of death we can't come out of it it's our responsibility amen if you don't fulfill your responsibility then any if you don't fulfill God God's way God won't want to lose you he'll take you away but if you want him to do his work in your life you have to fulfill that responsibility and to whom much is given much is required it's what required of you not to just become a church goer yeah no we are apart from that stage amen of church going yes you are a son of God Amen when you look at the people around you you have this privilege you're saying I am blessed with all the blessings then true servants who it comes in amen because now you want to to serve Hallelujah serve yes the people of God Amen because you have all these privileges amen and you want to use your pro you'll find even in

for whom the Lord loveth the chest in it yes and Scourge it every son whom you receiveth if you endure chestning God deals with us with sons for what son is he whom the father chest in the nuts oh but the script this word is too hard for me to look by oh we're getting whooped we're getting whooped from all sides we're getting every week it must be about prayer life every week it must be getting our life in order but if God is doing it to a son and daughter of God but if yea be without chastisement wherefore wear off all of our particles busted and not Sun furthermore we have it fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live amen for they verily for a few days chasten us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophets follow on good amen when God is correcting us when God is bringing the word to bring us back in line it is to profit us it's our benefits because he wants us to walk and enjoy this super abundant blessing upon us amen because he said I have come to give life and give it more abundantly amen amen he wants you to walk in the blessings You Know The Enemy is there he's coming to steal he's coming to kill he's coming to destroy amen and he doesn't want you to have a hold of you because why he has right for claims over you amen he says for we the very to for they will leave for a few days sorry no no chestning for the present seeming to be joyous but previous nevertheless afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised

God's people amen hallelujah the world is crying out there's no hope mankind have no hope yes signs have got no hope the wealth of the world can't help certain people in the condition yes because these are demon Spirits yes sir only Sons and Daughters of Gods full with the Holy Ghost can go and cast out the spirits amen can go and bring Deliverance to those people amen no one else can bring Deliverance to them but you and I this is the work that we call out foreign that's the responsibility upon us much is given to us much is required from us amen there's people out there that need help and they cannot get their help because you and I are sitting with the equipment yes amen we've got what it takes to help them they're not going to get it from the world yes amen Satan will bring them a little bit of things to help them to talk to them and try to calm them down but he's not going to deliver them yeah you and I got what it takes to deliver us to deliver them that's the word of God Amen without the word there's no Deliverance when say when Jesus when Satan tempted Jesus while he was on Earth what did Satan what did Jesus do Satan it is written yeah took him back to the word amen Hebrews 6 13 says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself sing surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise so he didn't come easily amen yet to patiently enjoy yes amen you have to wait for the promise to be fulfilled yes there was a time where we are to receive the word a promise for this hour that we are living in now but we are to patiently enjoy yes some gave up some walked away yes some left the faith defeat yes because Paul said there'll be a falling away of defaith Amen some left the faith amen they walked away they couldn't patiently enjoy but those that patiently enjoy are now working in the blessings amen amen so he said our blessed day and multiply thee and so after your patiently enjoy enjoy obtain the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them and then of strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the Earth of promise see God was willing to show more abundantly and to The Heirs of Promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things it was impossible for God to lie yes God can't lie amen so if God had promised in this hour and through his property is going to be a super Church there's going to be a super race amen and Invincible Army they have to be the people upon the Earth amen Jesus said greater if you believe in me the work that I do you shall do Greater Works than these they shall do God can't lie that's his words his words saying the Sancho follow them that believe amen then that science must follow amen God's word God cannot lie impossible um we might have a strong consolation we have fled for Refuge to lay old upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both show and steadfast which enter it into that within the veil yes whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus and I priests Forever After the order of amen look at the order we have look at the hope that we have now we have an eye priest amen who can be touched not just an eye priest now like they take the sacrifice of the people in the levitical priesthood but yeah we have a high priest who can be touched but the feelings of our infirmities because they come in like fashion like us they come and suffered like mankind amen amen amen he came and suffered with mankind he knew what it is to be starving he knew what it is to be beaten up he knew what it is to be depressed he knew what it is that all the men all the the tears of mankind and all the things that they share and therefore you could go and serve mankind amen and therefore every son and daughter coming up the same order must do the same amen oh the prophet says in the message Melchizedek the great Prince and King in paragraph 74. he says what a marvelous promise the two immutable things that God cannot lie and be God now if God was made a promise in his Bible here we believe the Bible to be the infallible word of God and if God has made a promise in this Bible we have this consolation and know that it's impossible for God to lie amen therefore when we see he promised it in the Bible we believe it yes take that word take God at his word amen be certain of God anchor your faith upon that word amen don't anchor your faith don't reason don't give in to the devil that's coming in your mind the devil's creating doubts amen and he's he's camouflaging the doubt with scientific words yeah scientific terminology oh you got sugar diabetes because of this and that you've got cancer because of this and that is candy coating but he's actually putting demon Spirits in there because when you receive his word when you receive that reasoning and you exceed that means you are receiving a seed right amen when you receive that seed it becomes manifest but cancel it amen resist the devil yeah and he shall flee amen say Satan it is written amen amen by his stripes I am ill amen foreign yes it says therefore when we see see it promised in the Bible We Believe It soul body and spirit it's impossible for him to lie now if there's any fault it's in US not in God for God he's obligated to his word yes amen four years one by his own words amen you see he comes back to us his word is guaranteed amen his word is just say the Lord amen yes his word is yeah amen he said incredible word amen amen if he said it in his word and that's his promise and he must come and fulfill his what he's obligated to his words but if there's any Force it's within us when we allow reasoning when we are our doubts amen yes I'm sure when we get to seeing it in that light things begin to shape up and hip up different than what they used to be amen healing of the body doesn't become a fiction yes he's not admit to us yes healing is reality amen healing is a children's bread amen healing is a sign that we you know what healing is healing is a sign of the wife was talking to me the other day and she's saying you know the healing is that sign because they're going to be the change of body I said yes that's the Blessed hope that we have that's what healing is a sign of Amen because it's showing you that the same this Mortal body is going to completely be healed that's right because why I'm talking about it just to be healed it's put here because of sin it's put in this condition right then he dies the cells die every day amen as you think you're living you're actually dying yeah the cells are dying it's leaking but it has to be healed amen that body this body of Flesh needs to be healed amen because sin put it in the condition sin put it to death but now it needs healing amen it needs a complete restoration and that's what the word has come to completely restore us from Mortal to immortality amen this very word that we are partaking of is going to change this model body to an immortal body and that's why we're changing from Glory unto glory amen that's right brother amen I'm sure when we he says healing of the body doesn't become a fiction it becomes a reality amen the baptism of the Holy Spirit doesn't become an emotional worked up substance this is not something someone you because maybe your legs are a nice worship song and suddenly now they feel the emotions and they're jumping up and down but they're going back to the whole way no it's become the solid substance when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost even when the Music Stops amen you worshiping amen your life is a lifestyle of worship even when you are alone you're worshiping you know how to worship your God Amen because you've got the holy spirit it's not just emotion to you it's a reality yeah hey man it's a lifestyle

is defeated he wants you to walk in Abundant Life amen amen amen when Joseph walked the place was blessed the place prospered amen yes yes we're not talking about the prosperity from the world because we're not lusting up the thing and we're talking about walking and testifying of Jesus Christ God is giving you your things that you are in need of amen God is granting your desires amen you wonder how God will bless you with a good house you want a car God will bless you with a good car you want a wife God will give you that right wife that will not leave you you pray about it you put it before God and he's going to give you that right wife amen you want a husband God is going to give you the right husband who will take care of you will not leave you amen amen don't let the devil come and

have an abundant life amen he don't want you to have a miserable life yeah you don't want you to have a miserable marriage amen amen he doesn't want you to be miserable at your workplace he wants you to be a light in your workplace yeah that's right amen Galatians 3 16 says and not to Ibraham and his Seed where the promise is made he said not into seeds as of many but as of one and to die seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before God before a God in Christ the law which was 430 years after cannot listen now that it should make the promise of none effect but if the instance inheritance be of the law it is no more promise but God gave it to Abraham by promising amen amen how did he give it by a promise but to Christ and we come from the sea royal Seed of Abraham which is to Christ amen amen and all blessings are of Promise amen amen because this is what he gave to everyone by promise because by faith Abraham believed God Amen it's a fake seed amen so you see if you trace your technology it's a fake genealogy goes all the way to God Amen not the fate of men but the faith of God yes it's a faith genology it goes all the way because your life comes from God amen so we're walking we're talking about speaking now and living abundantly not living a gloomy life Proverbs 3 9 says honor the Lord would I substance would all with the first fruits of then increase so shall thy bond be filled with plenty and thy pressure shall be burst over with new wine my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be wary of his correction for whom the Lord loverly corrected even as Father the Son in whom the son in whom he delighted so God is giving you a scripture now you see in scripture God is telling you how you can be blessed now how you can live in this Abundant Life now Matthew 6 33 says but seek ye first the kingdom of God Amen and he is righteousness [Music] so that is first it goes back to the first Commandments amen love the Lord God with all the heart with all their soul with all the might and he's righteousness all these things shall be added unto you amen all the things that you desire all the things that you need because the Bible said he shall Grant you the desires of your heart the things that you need to get by it shall be added unto you amen it's dead it's my promise amen take therefore no thought for tomorrow amen don't let reasoning come in oh I'm gonna make it tomorrow because my buying balance doesn't show me take it on your knees amen amen did you take it to the Lord and say Lord your word says I'm going to give you back your word Lord I mustn't take no thought for tomorrow amen amen Lord this I shouldn't have this stressful thought in my mind of how I'm going to make ends meet this is what your word says Lord for tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself amen amen sufficient unto the days the evil thereof so God will bless you as you have need of it amen Luke 6 37 says judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and they shall not be condemned forgive and yet shall be forgiven amen now this this could be not just for anybody who can forgive only God and if a son and daughter of God is expressing God yes if you forgive one another amen you see what says forgive and you shall be forgiven give and it shall be given unto you good measure press down shaken together running over shall men give in to your brother but with the same measure that you meet without it shall be measured to you again amen you want to live an abundant life Wow you know what the Jews do an abundant you know there's a question about why the Jews are so blessed people always wondered why their Jews was blessed with money well the first thing about the Jew the first thing when he goes into business he doesn't rely upon himself imagine under the blood of Woolen gold the Christ is now not even have turned away from them and come to the Gentiles but even then because of what they thought they believe that God is with them amen they believe that when they go into anything into any dealing God is with them so in other words they put in their trust and faith in God that's the first thing they put their trust and faith in God Amen amen so you want to walk abundantly and bless our way the first thing in anything that you do put your trust and faith in God Amen the second thing when they are blessed they give they call it give it to charity and we give into the house according to the kingdom of God and the more you sow the more you'll live the more you give into the kingdom of God that's why I said seek you first the kingdom of God and is righteousness I'm giving your principles now that has been proven for generations and generations that is working amen he's working for the Jew for the natural Seed of Abraham the Jews how much more we the spiritual seed those that come under the Royal seat of Abraham amen it says so you don't judge and you condemn this world because you know that they lost and the Son of God daughter of God you know these privileges are given to you God has revealed himself to you that's when you can come to such you know the more God has revealed to you the more humble you become you'd actually become sorry sorrowful for a dying generation yes a world do you realize that you're looking at people around you that are dying that are spiritually dead people that are going to go to hell the people that you are looking around you and if you feel nothing to us then there's something wrong about your work well through that through that because the Bible says those that are full with the Holy Ghost are crying and sang for the abomination of the Lost amen if you feel nothing for mankind when you're talking I mean I actually look when I look at you know the billionaires and the people that live that life that lavish lifestyle and actually feel sorry for them I actually don't I'm not don't envy them like I want to be there I feel sorry for them I say what a privileged person I am they've got everything they quiet all the wealth of this world they're quite all these things that they want anything that they want they can just have it but what they do what I've got they don't have amen amen how many of you have been to a funeral of maybe a family member or people that you know that are not saved how do you feel yeah when you know especially when you know a person that definitely wasn't in a condition yeah so that's what I'm saying judge not and he shall not be judged condemn not initial not be condemned forgive when you shall be forgiven amen given it shall be given unto you good measure press down shaken together and running over shall man give in to your husband second Corinthians 9 6 says for this I say he would sow it sparingly he'll reap also sparingly yes that's that's that's the principles of God that can't change God can't change his law it cannot change his law amen and he would sow it beautiful bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according as the purpose in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for God loves a cheerful Giver amen amen so when you're giving even given to your own household person help your own first amen you got something God has rescued something and a believer of need of it help your people first amen amen amen help the author of The Faith first yeah and when you give you see what it says here not drudgingly so if you're doing something for a believer doing something for the things of God don't do it grudgingly or necessity for God love it and cheerful yes so when you're giving something for the kingdom of God give it cheerfully yes yes amen these are principles that can help you amen Galatians 5 2 says 22 says but the fruit of the spirit is our spiritual blessings is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance again such day is no law amen and the famous portion of scripture which is a must Malachi 3 10. because don't even ask anybody to pray for your blessings if you don't follow the scripture bring ye all the tides into the straws that there may be made in my notes and prove now see God is asking to prove yeah in the Bible say Do not Test the Lord your God but yeah he's saying prove now prove me now your word saved the Lord of vote if I will not open you the windows of Heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it even room to receive it and I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes so you see that same scripture John 10 10. the enemy that's coming to steal that's coming to destroy the Devourer amen amen he said I will rebuke the devouter for your sakes amen and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground neither shall your Vine cast a fruit before the time in the field say the Lord of hosts and All Nation shall call you Bliss for sure he shall be delightsome a Delights of land see the Lord of hosts amen amen take that to you and I know all Nation shall call you and I bless because you are going to be that light amen yes you're gonna light up this nation you're gonna light up the place that you are and you're going to be the delightsome land amen this is your land amen be in the land the land of the Holy Ghost amen we're dwelling in the land how's your land how's your body amen say the Lord of hosts I don't have much more of this clothing you're trusting God for healing amen he says in the message confirmation and evidence in a mission in the message confirmation and evidence paragraph 37. confirmation and evidence Telegraph 37. now in Hebrews we taught again that D fate equals 11 faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen it's a substance now it isn't a hope most people come with hope a hope is going to be done I hope you know I hope I'm going to be healed yeah hope I'll have money in my bank account that's a hope there's a difference with open faith faith is something solid tangible right he says now it isn't a hope most people come with hope but faith is the substance it isn't something that you're hoping for when faith has taken a hole you have a substance not just him but you've got a whole of something you know it nothing shakes you from it amen it's yours you're positive you have it in your hand you got it it's your possession amen amen like the brother was healed the blind man he was healed and he took it it wasn't seen no one could see it naturally in the physical in a Physical Realm they couldn't see it but he took all of it amen it was his possession amen he possessed it amen and he began to be positive he began to confess it and confess it until one day while sitting in the Bible room everything sight began to come amen it became it became manifested amen for instance see what it says here if I was starving was dying of starvation and a loaf of bread would save my life and the purchase of a loaf of bread is 25 cents and someone gave me the 25 cents now just as much as I can see and I know that I hold at 25 cents which is the buying power of the loaf of bread I can be just as happy with the 25 cents I could be with the loaf of bread for already have the purchasing power that buys the loaf of bread so you already got it you got that purchasing power but now when you want it you go and apply to use it amen so that's what faith is saying if you believe that in my faith it's already given is that substance amen so that's why so that's the way fit is Faith is something you have you got it and when you receive faith that God is then God is going to give you this yet your healing might not be there but yet Something Is Anchored within you tells you that it's going to be all right then you can be just as happy as you were you see you you might be having the signal the certain thing that you trust in God for any healing but if you anchor your faith on his word and say it's done amen and you take God at his word it's there so you know you don't continue being said about that condition now amen you don't be negative in other words don't be negative about the condition confess the positive saying I am healed amen it's done amen it's finished I have it by faith it's angered it's done and as you keep confessing now according to your confession it's gonna manifest he's going to manifest in this realm it's done already in the Supernatural Realm but in this realm it will manifest in the time that is supposed to manifest but it will con if you continue in your confession so he says you continue being just as happy sitting in a wheelchair as you wear out there jumping on the street up and down nobody putting it right in a wheelchair but in a wheelchair now but he's saying they must continue being happy shouting and running around praising God because you already got the evidence amen amen amen amen amen see it is a name it and imagine it isn't an imagination it's a substance when you get yourself you get a signal in your bank account on your phone saying you got so much in your bank account right you don't have to evidence right you haven't put the money in your hand isn't it but you've got the evidence there right you believe it amen you believe it because you can see it right right that's your phone account but that's another that's through the fourth dimension you're receiving it right in your phone account is coming through there the money is floating in the fourth dimension but now when you go to the ATM now you want to draw that physical money then you go and do it because you had faith enough to believe that the money is there right amen you draw it just like that God has given it his word it's done there that's right yes so angry your faith day it's done you said two immutable things God cannot lie yeah amen so it's done it's in his word that's right so if we can't lie if you can believe the bank account why can't you believe God's word yes sir amen so take him by his word if you believe is what he's there take it and apply it taking and apply to your knee today yes whatever your need may be take his word and apply there amen amen then you become positive about it you start confessing it amen yes then go and justify about it amen maybe it's not materializing as yet but there will be an hour it's going to materialize amen but the devil will come to steal to destroy he doesn't want you to have that Abundant Life but God wants you to live more abundantly amen amen he wants you to walk in this super Abundant Life amen yes sir Hallelujah because why you are the people put on the earth to light up this age you are not here by chance when God predestinated someone is not by chance God if we prepared a place for you and play a time that you'll come here a time and season that you are pre-planned to be here amen amen amen he was pre-planned that you'll come in his age so he given you the word to equip you for this age amen amen he said you have that you you hope that you will you kind of have an imaginary faith and that you feel that you have appropriated that but when actually you got a whole of Faith it's a substance it says something real then you hold it then what brings it amen take your mind last two quotes in the message my redeemer liveth he saw God was with him sorry paragraph I think it's from 118. he saw God was with him wherever he did nobody was a prince of prosperity speaking about Joseph the world prospered everywhere Joseph was there was a prosperity for he was the prince of prosperity and even for sharing Christ wherever Christ is there is prosperity amen and when Christ returns to the Earth all the curse of the earth will be taken away some of these days the old desert child Blossom as a rose and the rough places will be made smooth amen and shall bring forth in the abundance for he is the prince of prosperity wherever he is amen amen where is he now wherever he is must be prosperous prosperous amen amen it must Prosper that's right amen so your spiritual life must Prosper amen your spiritual work must Prosper your walking defeat must Prosper amen amen he says he in the message six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel you say it's in paragraph 69 he was the type of the son of prosperity everything Joseph done prospered and when Jesus returned in the Millennium that's
