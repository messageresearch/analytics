[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] of the Lord.
[0:06] And there
[0:09] were words
[0:11] that was spoken
[0:17] by the prophet
[0:20] of Malachi.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. meet you all in the
[0:28] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[0:29] Jesus Christ.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[0:32] Lord to worship.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. We see the day
[0:36] fast approaching.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; We see times changing, seasons changing.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the bride is also changing.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we beholding him, we are
[0:44] changing into his very own image and
[0:46] likeness.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Just want to wish our brother Luke a
[0:52] very happy birthday.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give him a hand. Amen.
[0:57] Turned 66 today.
[1:00] Don't let his looks deceive you. Amen.
[1:02] So he turned 66 today. So we pray the
[1:04] Lord will continue to be with him and
[1:05] bless him.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's turn to the
[1:07] Bible. Praise the Lord.
[1:16] One Kings. Let's go to the book of one
[1:18] kings chapter 17.
[1:25] Read from verse one there.
[1:28] Amen. And Elijah the Tishbite who was of
[1:31] the inhabitants of Gilead said unto
[1:34] Ahab, "As the Lord God of Israel liveth
[1:37] before whom I stand, there shall not be
[1:40] due nor rain these years, but according
[1:42] to my word."
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we know that the word of the
[1:46] Lord comes to a prophet. When he's
[1:48] saying it's my word, Amen. You got to
[1:50] understand who he's speaking there. Now,
[1:52] &gt;&gt; it's God veiled in a prophet.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "But according to my word,"
[1:57] you would hear the prophet go on and
[1:59] dramatize it. Amen. We'll drop down to
[2:02] verse 9 there. So, we know he's first
[2:04] sustained at the brook.
[2:07] Amen. That the brook dries up.
[2:12] And he says in verse 9, "Arise, get thee
[2:14] to Zerapath, which belongth to Zidon,
[2:17] and dwell there. Behold, I have
[2:20] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[2:22] thee." So he arose and went to Zerapath.
[2:25] And when he came to the gate of the
[2:27] city, behold, the widow woman was there
[2:29] gathering of sticks. And he called to
[2:32] her and said, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a
[2:34] little water in a vessel that I may
[2:36] drink." And as she was going to fetch
[2:39] it, he called to her and said, "Bring
[2:40] me, I pray, be thee, a morsel of bread
[2:43] in thine hand." Amen. Let's pray.
[2:45] Father, we thank you, Lord, for your
[2:46] precious word. We know, Lord, in your
[2:48] word is life, oh God. Lord, you have
[2:51] drawn yourself out in pattern, in type,
[2:53] and shadow through your Bible, oh God.
[2:55] And Lord, even as we come this evening
[2:57] to draw from your word, I pray, Lord,
[2:58] that you would be, Lord, come down and
[3:00] Lord, break the bread of life to us,
[3:02] Lord. And I pray, Father, even as you'll
[3:04] meet the need of the people, oh God,
[3:06] while the word is being spoken, Lord, I
[3:07] pray you'll discern their hearts and
[3:09] speak to every heart, oh God. Lord, we
[3:11] welcome you into this place and we want
[3:13] to give you the preeminence, the glory,
[3:14] and the honor. We commit all things into
[3:16] your precious and mighty name for your
[3:18] glory and for your honor with much
[3:19] thanksgiving. Amen. Amen. You may be
[3:22] seated.
[3:24] Praise the Lord.
[3:28] Amen. And then I want to get to
[3:31] John 6:32. I can put that Josh should
[3:35] get my notes. Amen. So he says John John
[3:38] 6:32. So remember what Elijah asked for.
[3:42] He asked for water and then he asked for
[3:45] bread.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; Now we know that Jesus says that he was
[3:50] the living water.
[3:52] And he says now we're going to read.
[3:53] Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[3:55] verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you
[3:58] not that bread from heaven, but my
[4:00] father giveth you the true bread from
[4:02] heaven."
[4:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; What is that true bread? If they asking
[4:08] Jesus, now tell us. For the bread of God
[4:10] is he which cometh down from heaven.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; And giveth life unto the world.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the bread of God is he which
[4:20] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[4:22] unto the world. Then said they unto him,
[4:25] Lord, evermore give us this bread. And
[4:28] Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of
[4:31] life.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; He that cometh to me shall never hunger,
[4:34] and he that believeth on me shall never
[4:37] thirst.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; So it's always got to do with bread and
[4:40] water.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll never hunger, you'll never
[4:43] thirst.
[4:45] Amen. Then we'll get to that first quote
[4:47] there. He's the prophet saying the
[4:49] hungry people looked to him one day
[4:51] found him and found sustaining bread a
[4:54] type the hungry today can find the bread
[4:56] of life not find a creed you don't find
[4:59] a founder you don't find a reformer you
[5:02] find life when you find Christ the bread
[5:05] of life
[5:06] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[5:07] &gt;&gt; amen so if we get back to our story here
[5:10] amen
[5:14] we are looking at God veil in Elijah
[5:17] &gt;&gt; and When God is veiled in a prophet,
[5:19] that is son of man.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; God in a prophet is son of man.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; When he said to Ezekiel, son of man,
[5:24] prophesy again.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; God in a prophet is son of man.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; He's veiled in a prophet. Amen. So he's
[5:31] coming to
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Now watch how the Bible describes her.
[5:37] He says, "For there I have commanded a
[5:39] widow."
[5:41] &gt;&gt; Now if you go into invisible union, the
[5:43] prophet of God is saying the first
[5:45] husband must be dead. Amen.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; He says your first denominational
[5:51] husband must be dead.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; In order for Christ to come now.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; And be interested in you.
[5:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; How many of you have read that?
[6:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have time to go into all
[6:04] of the quotes, but Amen. You are well
[6:06] taught to know that in that message,
[6:08] he's talking about the first husband
[6:10] must be dead.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; So then this woman is the perfect
[6:13] condition.
[6:17] She's in the perfect condition for the
[6:18] word to come to because her first
[6:20] husband is dead.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; This woman is a type of the church.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Now, you know that there's there's three
[6:28] I think it's in John 5:17. He says
[6:31] there's three that bear record in
[6:32] heaven.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; And then he says there's three on earth.
[6:36] He says there's water, blood, and
[6:38] spirit.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet is typing that with a
[6:41] birth. Yes.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; He says that the first thing breaks is
[6:44] water,
[6:46] &gt;&gt; then blood. Blood is typing sacrifice
[6:49] &gt;&gt; and then spirit.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we're finding here that he
[6:54] says, "Arise, get thee to Zerapath,
[6:56] which belonging to Zidon, and dwell
[6:58] there. Behold, I have commanded a woman,
[7:01] a widow woman, specific
[7:03] &gt;&gt; first husband dead,
[7:05] &gt;&gt; perfect bing ground for the world,
[7:07] &gt;&gt; to sustain thee."
[7:09] So, not only does a prophet have a
[7:11] message, he's got to have a port,
[7:14] another part of the word to respond to
[7:17] his message.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; The prophet couldn't bring a message or
[7:24] powerful message without there being a
[7:26] woman to receive that word.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; So, the woman was going to give life to
[7:30] the prophet's word.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a portion of the word
[7:35] left for us
[7:37] &gt;&gt; just like how Eliza
[7:40] went to the woman at the well
[7:42] &gt;&gt; now I didn't make a mistake there.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; Rebecca was the woman at the well.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; She was at the well.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; Was she a woman?
[7:52] &gt;&gt; So Elisa went to the woman at the well.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; And he said give me
[7:58] &gt;&gt; to drink. But there was a portion of the
[8:01] word that he didn't speak to her.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; But because she was the word for that
[8:07] day,
[8:08] &gt;&gt; she said, "Not only will I give you,
[8:10] I'll give to your camels."
[8:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; There's a portion of the word left for
[8:15] us.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which we must fulfill.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things the prophet left
[8:21] unspoken.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; He says sealed. He says some things I
[8:25] should take to my grave. But there's a
[8:26] lady on the earth. There's a woman on
[8:28] the earth who has the unspoken part
[8:31] &gt;&gt; and she is fulfilling the unspoken part.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; So we find here he gets to the widow
[8:36] woman. Perfect condition of the word
[8:38] now. And he says he came to the gate and
[8:41] he says behold the woman was gathering
[8:42] sticks. So this woman is also not a lazy
[8:45] woman.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; She's about doing the things.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; She's she's at work in action. Amen.
[8:52] She's gathering sticks. You know the
[8:54] prophet types the sticks and he says
[8:55] it's the cross. Amen. So watch now. He
[8:58] says, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little
[9:00] water in the vessel that I may drink."
[9:03] &gt;&gt; And watch as she was going to fetch it,
[9:05] which means she had justification.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; The first portion is water.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hallelujah.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; She had justification.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; She had water. She was going to fetch
[9:19] it.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Which means she had she had been now at
[9:22] the stage of loser's message.
[9:26] Praise the Lord.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; But she needed something more because
[9:30] there was a famine in the land.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; And we know there's another famine in
[9:34] the land. Not for bread or water, but
[9:36] now for the true word of God.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; In this day and age.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we can't only have water is
[9:42] what I'm trying to tell you. We can't
[9:44] totally have justification.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; So, we are finding the evidence that she
[9:51] has water.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now many people
[9:58] want to know or they question now this
[10:01] thought that God said I have commanded a
[10:05] widow woman. You read that there in the
[10:07] Bible.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; But the question is where did God
[10:11] command the widow woman?
[10:14] &gt;&gt; How many of you have heard that?
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Where does God command the widow woman?
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Because there's no record of it.
[10:23] But I can see it right here. It's
[10:26] staring at us.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; Where God commands the widow woman.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; So he called to her
[10:35] and he said to her, "Fetch me, I pray
[10:38] thee." That sounds like somebody
[10:40] commanding someone.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; But you'll miss it if you don't know
[10:46] that God is veiled in Elijah.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's the command right there.
[10:54] Fetch thee, I pray thee, little water in
[10:57] a vessel that I may drink. So he sees
[10:59] she going.
[11:01] Amen. In verse 11, and as she's going,
[11:04] he commands her again.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; He called, he says, "Bring me, I pray,
[11:08] the immortal of bread in thine hand."
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; So God is commanding the widow woman
[11:15] through Elijah.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[11:18] Don't think you are hearing the words of
[11:20] a man when you are hearing William
[11:21] Brandham speak.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; God is commanding this bride through the
[11:25] prophet.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; People are looking for a portion where
[11:30] God now comes and speaks secretly to the
[11:32] woman.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; No, God is speaking through Elijah.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; And doesn't that sound like a command?
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Fetch me a water.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Bring me a morsel of bread.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:47] And as she was going to fetch it, he
[11:49] called to her and said, "Bring me, I
[11:51] pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy
[11:52] hand." Now there's a portion now which
[11:54] she needs to progress through the next
[11:56] portion which is blood which is typing
[11:58] the sacrifice.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; And this woman must now go through
[12:03] sanctification. She must go to that
[12:05] portion of sacrificing what she has.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; She must sacrifice what she has.
[12:18] And then she said as the Lord liveth.
[12:20] Now remember the cake is bread because
[12:22] what does he ask her for? He asked her
[12:24] for bread,
[12:26] &gt;&gt; right? So don't think now he said go to
[12:28] uh west what West bakery and buy cake.
[12:32] No, the cake they're talking about is
[12:34] bread.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; Because as the Lord liveth, I have not a
[12:39] cake bread, but a handful of meal in a
[12:42] barrel and a little oil in a cruise.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; And behold, I am gathering two sticks
[12:48] that I may go in and dress it for me and
[12:51] my son that we may eat it and die.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Well, with with with just justification
[12:56] alone, you are going to die.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:02] with that revelation of the word. They
[13:04] are dying.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; There is no life in it.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's all they're doing.
[13:12] They're gathering two sticks. They got
[13:13] the Hail Marys.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; They got their works.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So right now she's in the phase of
[13:22] between Luther and Wesley.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; And she's gathering two sticks. She can
[13:26] go in and dress it for a son that we may
[13:28] eat it and die.
[13:31] Were they dead after Wesley?
[13:34] &gt;&gt; They needed some life.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; That's how the Isuza Street outpouring
[13:39] came out. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; And Elijah said unto her, now many
[13:45] people think that she went without a
[13:47] promise.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Before she even goes to bed or before
[13:51] she even makes a decision to go and do
[13:54] this thing, there's a prophetic word
[13:57] spoken.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:01] He doesn't speak this after she brings
[14:03] the cake.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; He doesn't speak it after she bakes the
[14:06] bread.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; To say now that you're obedient, your
[14:09] barrel won't run dry. No, the prophetic
[14:12] word is spoken first.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Because the very next thing, remember
[14:20] she's still talking to him and saying,
[14:21] "I have I have a little bit of meal. I
[14:24] have a little bit of oil." Then he says,
[14:28] "Fear not. Go and do as thou has said.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Go bake the cake."
[14:34] &gt;&gt; But make me there a little cake first.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; That is where the sacrifice is coming.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; Make room for the word.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Pay attention to what the prophet has
[14:47] commanded.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; I ask you to bring me a cake first.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; Bring it unto me and after make for thee
[14:57] and thy son.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Watch. He doesn't stop there. Now,
[15:02] &gt;&gt; he's going to give the prophetic word.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. For thus sayeth the Lord God of
[15:07] Israel.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; The barrel of meal shall not waste.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Neither shall the truths of oil fail.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Until the day of the Lord send it rain
[15:16] upon the earth.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; So look at the prophecies that our
[15:25] prophet has prophesied over us.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; This will be a super church,
[15:28] &gt;&gt; a super race, an invincible army.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; A prophetic word given to the church
[15:33] before she was even super.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Before she's even a super race, a super
[15:37] church, an invincible army, a word is
[15:39] spoken over her. Now she needs to go
[15:42] forth and fulfill her creation of the
[15:44] word.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; So she's now going under a thus say the
[15:49] Lord commission. And she as she's baking
[15:51] the cake, what do you think? Her heart
[15:53] is rejoicing.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; I've got a prophet here who just told me
[15:57] if I bake this cake, if I sacrifice
[16:00] right now. Amen. Hallelujah. The barrel
[16:02] will not run dry. The pool of oil will
[16:05] not run dry. So follow the prophet's
[16:07] word, we are under a prophetic gift,
[16:09] under a prophetic anointing.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Every day that we live, every step that
[16:15] we make, we under a prophetic anointing.
[16:17] We are following the prophet of the age.
[16:19] every word that he prophesied over us.
[16:21] Amen. He has prophesied.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; That in this time of famine, we shall be
[16:27] sustained.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; And then see, watch now verse 15. And
[16:42] she went and did according to the saying
[16:45] of Elijah. And she and he and the house
[16:49] did eat many days.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad it came out this way.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't wait for the cake first to
[16:57] prophesy.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; He prophesied first.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; That's our God. I know that's my God of
[17:02] Abraham because he told Abraham, "Get
[17:04] thee out of thy country."
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Before even before he got out of his
[17:08] country, he said, "Get thee out of thy
[17:09] country. I shall make thee a great
[17:11] nation.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; So God always give a promise first.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; You always give the word first. But
[17:18] people don't want to follow the word of
[17:19] God.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Now, didn't we have a prophet who was
[17:24] prophesying since 1933,
[17:26] &gt;&gt; seven major visions.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; He prophesied through the church.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Then as the prophecy was getting greater
[17:32] and revelation was coming greater, he
[17:34] was prophesying greater things over this
[17:36] portion of the bride.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:39] Lord,
[17:40] &gt;&gt; even before it happened.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; And she did according to the saying of
[17:45] Elijah, she and he and a house did eat
[17:49] many days. What was that? The sacrifice.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes sir.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So she had come through
[17:56] sanctification now.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:03] And the barrel of meal wasted not,
[18:05] neither did the proofs of oil fail
[18:07] according to the word of the Lord which
[18:09] he spake by Elijah.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; So reconsider how we approach the
[18:17] prophet's word.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet's message.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; It's the word of the Lord which he spake
[18:22] via William Brandham.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So which means that remember
[18:29] this woman had a portion of meal
[18:32] &gt;&gt; which is typing now the she made a bread
[18:35] &gt;&gt; but her bread was not a living bread.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; She needed to connect with the prophet's
[18:42] message in order for her bread to become
[18:45] a living bread that would sustain her
[18:47] through the famine.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; So which means Luther's message won't
[18:52] work.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Wesley's message won't work. restoration
[18:55] of the gifts alone won't work.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; You've got to connect with the prophetic
[18:59] message
[19:00] &gt;&gt; in order for your whatever you have,
[19:02] your word, your portion of the word,
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; to become a living word.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[19:14] Now, it doesn't stop there
[19:17] because we said there's water, there's
[19:20] blood, but there must come forth spirit.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says that uh
[19:26] mechanics alone is not good enough.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; The word alone in his revelation form is
[19:32] not good enough. He says there must come
[19:34] dynamics upon the mechanics.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost coming to the word.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; So, we've been feeding on the word, but
[19:42] we need quickening power now.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; And he says the dynamics of this church
[19:46] is a refilling of the Holy Ghost.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:52] Praise the Lord. So this woman is
[19:54] sitting at a state now where she has
[19:56] listened to the prophet's message.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; She has obeyed the prophet's message.
[20:00] She's witnessing the supernatural.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; The flour is not running out. The oil is
[20:05] not running out. She's able to sustain
[20:07] herself in the time of famine.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; But remember, through her first
[20:15] marriage, she has reproduced life. Yes,
[20:20] &gt;&gt; she's got a son.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; And he said, and let's go to verse 18.
[20:31] Okay. 17. And it came to pass after
[20:34] these things, after the supernatural,
[20:38] that the son of the woman, the mistress
[20:40] of the house, fell sick,
[20:43] and his sickness was so sore that there
[20:46] was no breath left in him.
[20:49] No spirit.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; What leaves it when you die?
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Spirit.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; What are we looking for? The third
[20:56] portion of the word.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Come on. We We have We showed you water.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; We showed you blood sacrifice.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Now spirit.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; What have I to do with thee, oh man of
[21:13] God? Art thou come unto me to call my
[21:16] sin to remembrance and to slay my son?
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Now remember what we have said that
[21:25] Elijah the prophet is typing son of man.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; He is a son of man revealing the son of
[21:30] man.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; So now the boy dies spirit leaves him.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; The spirit left the church.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; But there must come forth life.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; And he cried unto and said, "Oh,"
[21:48] he said unto her, "Give me thy son." And
[21:51] he took him out of her bosom and carried
[21:54] him into a loft where he abodeed and
[21:57] laid him on his own bed.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:03] Get into the presence of the prophet.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Listen to his voice. Amen.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice of the seventh
[22:10] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[22:12] mystery of God should be finished.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Never stop listening to the tapes.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Never stop listen reading the books.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; He took him into his environment.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; He took him out of the arms of the
[22:30] woman. He took him out of the arms of
[22:31] the widow. Remember again, this is the
[22:34] life the the life of the woman
[22:36] reproduced. But this life can't be
[22:38] sustaining
[22:40] &gt;&gt; because this is the life from the Oh, I
[22:42] hope somebody gets what how the Lord is
[22:44] bringing it to me.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; The life of the woman's the the woman's
[22:48] first husband can't sustain itself in
[22:50] the presence of God
[22:51] &gt;&gt; in this portion of the word.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; So the you must die.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Because this boy is going to have a new
[23:01] birth.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; The boy is dead.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he's going to have a new
[23:07] birth.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. But how is the new birth coming?
[23:15] Through a prophetic ministry
[23:18] &gt;&gt; through Christ himself veiled in a
[23:19] prophet.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Life is coming to the church. The
[23:23] prophet says denominational rumors had
[23:25] him bound. Had the Holy Ghost bound for
[23:27] 2,000 years. But the evening messenger
[23:30] loose the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; So we got the and and and I don't know
[23:35] if you know the spirit of Elijah works
[23:37] five times.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; This is the original Elijah.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; So all types of shadows he will lay down
[23:43] there.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; So all the religious leaders of the
[23:49] world remember they had 400 prophets and
[23:50] all of these things. They couldn't
[23:52] deliver the boy. The boy died.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Because his life was wrong.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; He was from the life of the first
[23:59] husband.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now that she had met the word,
[24:02] &gt;&gt; now she had connected with the word,
[24:04] &gt;&gt; the evidence of this boy that she had
[24:07] reproduced, the life that she had
[24:08] reproduced must die.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; You can't bring your denominational
[24:12] husband's son into the message.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Your denominational son's ideas into the
[24:17] message. It won't mix.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; It's got to die.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; And we have many people who have left
[24:25] denominations, but they bring the
[24:26] denominational ideas into the message of
[24:28] the hour. But under the message of the
[24:30] hour, that spirit must die.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; So the prophet takes ownership of the
[24:42] son.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; He takes him. Now, what does he have? A
[24:45] dead son.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Now remember, the son is typing the
[24:50] image that the woman reproduced.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. took him out of her
[24:55] bosom, carried him into the loft where a
[24:57] boat and laid him on his own bed and he
[24:59] cried unto the Lord and said, "Oh Lord
[25:01] my God, hast thou brought evil upon the
[25:03] widow whom with whom I sold by slaying a
[25:06] son?" Now watch what he does.
[25:10] He is son of man.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; And the boy must come into the image of
[25:14] son of man.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Son of man doesn't end with the prophet.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; We ready the quote in proving his word.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Because the bride now under a messenger
[25:28] becomes the final voice.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Let's read it.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he stretched himself upon the
[25:36] child three times.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; And cried unto the Lord. Oh Lord my God,
[25:42] I pray thee, let this child's soul come
[25:44] into him again.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:51] You'll find Elisha who is a type of
[25:53] Elijah
[25:55] with a double portion. When he's here
[25:58] with this dead boy, he places nose upon
[26:01] nose, eyes upon eyes.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Where is he getting it? From this
[26:05] Elijah.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; He's stretching himself over the boy.
[26:09] Why? He's trying to make that boy come
[26:11] into his image and likeness. Amen.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Let the child's soul come
[26:18] into him again." The boy is dead. He
[26:20] needs to be born again.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he's going to have a new birth
[26:24] now.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:29] And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah,
[26:31] and the soul of the child came into him
[26:33] again, and he revived.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Life come back to the boy. Life come
[26:38] back to the church. when this evening
[26:40] time messenger came and sounded the word
[26:42] of God.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; They don't know what hit the church.
[26:47] They call him Amen. The They call him
[26:49] the the one who spearheaded the healing
[26:52] revival. But life had come back into the
[26:54] church.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; They had thought that days of miracles
[26:58] are gone and passed away.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; But life came back to the church
[27:02] &gt;&gt; in its infancy.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; But then 1963.
[27:08] Amen. The giver of life himself was
[27:11] coming down to the earth.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[27:15] &gt;&gt; he says, amen. That the the the no more
[27:19] just the gifts of the Holy Ghost, but
[27:21] the giver, the life of the life himself
[27:24] came down upon the earth.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; To connect with the body.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah
[27:32] and the soul of the child came into him
[27:35] again and he revived. He came back to
[27:37] life. He had a new birth.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; And Elijah took the child and brought
[27:46] him down out of the chamber into the
[27:48] house and delivered him to his mother.
[27:50] And Elijah said, "See, thy son live."
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; The bright tree was fully restored.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; What the canker, the palmer, the
[28:00] caterpillar, and the locust had eaten.
[28:02] Amen. But I will restore, say the Lord.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Not by power
[28:10] &gt;&gt; and not by might but by my
[28:13] &gt;&gt; spirit. There's your water, blood, and
[28:14] spirit. Say the Lord.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; You see, it's only when you have a new
[28:25] birth. It's only when now at the end
[28:27] time message that when you see the sun
[28:31] risen again.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Please get this last verse. When you see
[28:35] the image of Christ on display again,
[28:38] &gt;&gt; watch what she says.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Because the image is back on the earth,
[28:41] because the image is resurrected, I'm
[28:44] talking about you coming into the image
[28:45] and likeness of Christ. I'm talking
[28:47] about you being adopted.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you being just like
[28:51] Jesus.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. She says, "Now
[28:56] by this I know that thou art a man of
[28:58] God,
[28:59] &gt;&gt; and that the word of the Lord is in thy
[29:03] mouth is truth."
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; So what is the evidence of the prophet's
[29:08] message?
[29:09] &gt;&gt; When we become the word made flesh,
[29:11] &gt;&gt; when we see the life of Christ on
[29:13] display, by this I know.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Not by the miracle, signs, and wonders.
[29:18] She didn't say this when she saw the the
[29:21] meal. when she saw the flower
[29:23] reproduced, when she saw the oil
[29:25] reproduced,
[29:26] &gt;&gt; but when she saw the life resurrected,
[29:28] when she saw the spirit come back upon
[29:30] the boy, when she saw the life of Christ
[29:32] back on display,
[29:34] &gt;&gt; she said, "By this I know that thou art
[29:35] a man of God."
[29:37] &gt;&gt; So all that the prophet prophesied over
[29:39] us, when we start to see ourselves
[29:41] looking in the mirror now and they say,
[29:42] "Mama, that's me. I see myself. I'm
[29:45] becoming the word made flesh. By this I
[29:47] know."
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. that everything the prophet of God
[29:50] spoke about, they want to see signs and
[29:52] wonders and miracles. Amen. But me
[29:54] becoming the word made flesh is giving
[29:57] life to the prophet's message.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; How is the word being made flesh? In
[30:01] secret,
[30:03] &gt;&gt; in your home,
[30:04] &gt;&gt; here in the church, the word of God is
[30:06] being preached into you.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Little by little, you're being
[30:09] formed into the word image. You are
[30:11] coming just like Jesus. Amen.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; And by this,
[30:16] by this I know that thou art a man of
[30:19] God.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; By this is the vindication of the
[30:22] prophet's message.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; When his life is resurrected in you and
[30:27] I.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; And that the word of the Lord in thy
[30:31] mouth is truth.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; So if you're looking to ever bring
[30:36] evidence of the prophet's message,
[30:39] &gt;&gt; look for the life of Christ to be on
[30:40] display in your life. Yes.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Don't try and go and say, "Look what the
[30:45] prophet did here. Look what the prophet
[30:47] did there. She is a mighty." That's not
[30:49] the evidence.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; What is the woman saying the evidence
[30:51] is?
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; By this the resurrection of the life.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; When Christ is formed in me.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the Apostle Paul says, "I
[31:05] travail.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; I travail."
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. The five-fold ministry is in true
[31:10] veil until Christ be formed indeed.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it just blesses our heart to
[31:20] see it in the word.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; To see this. Amen. How God typed it here
[31:24] in the Bible
[31:26] &gt;&gt; with the first Elijah.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[31:32] Now when I was telling you about about
[31:34] Elijah and and the Lord saying through
[31:37] this through him I've commanded a
[31:40] blessing upon I've commanded the widow.
[31:42] It's the same thing like in Exodus when
[31:44] the Lord says I am come down.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; If you go to Exodus 3, you'll pick it up
[31:50] there.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[31:58] If you go to Exodus chapter 3, you'll
[32:01] see there
[32:03] from verse 7. Amen. He says, "I have
[32:08] surely seen the affliction of my people
[32:10] which are in Egypt and have heard their
[32:12] cry by the reason of their task masters,
[32:14] for I know their sorrows."
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; And I have come down to deliver them out
[32:19] of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[32:21] bring them up out of the land. So I am
[32:23] going to do this. Yes.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; But if you drop down there
[32:27] to verse 10, you'll see how the Lord is
[32:29] going to do it. Come now, therefore, I
[32:32] will send thee.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; I will send thee.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; So, it's God veiled in Moses.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; So, it's the same principle. It's the
[32:43] same God who is now saying, I have
[32:45] commanded the widow woman.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; How is he going to command it? Through
[32:49] Elijah.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; You've read it so many times, but you've
[32:52] never seen it. as Elijah commanding the
[32:54] woman.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; God through Elijah is commanding the
[32:58] woman.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; What was happening here? The prophet
[33:09] says when two omnipotentans meet,
[33:13] two omnipotent were meeting, Elijah and
[33:15] the widow woman,
[33:17] &gt;&gt; two omnipotent,
[33:18] &gt;&gt; yes,
[33:19] &gt;&gt; connecting. When you connect with the
[33:21] prophetic message, two omnipotence are
[33:24] meeting. Amen. Let's go to the last
[33:26] quote there, brother. Amen.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; In the message, birth pains.
[33:45] Okay, let's just skip that one. Let's go
[33:46] to the one above that. I'll just close
[33:48] with this one. Amen.
[33:51] Praise the Lord.
[33:58] The Lutheran spoke for God at that time.
[34:00] So that was the water that she had. She
[34:02] was willing to give him the water.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; But they organized and again the pure
[34:06] word was lost for organization tends
[34:08] towards dogma and creeds and and not the
[34:11] simple word. They could no longer speak
[34:14] for God. Then God sent Wesley and he was
[34:17] the voice with the word in his day.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; The people who took his revelation from
[34:22] God. Now apply this to your own life now
[34:25] because you taking the revelation from
[34:27] William Brham, right? It's coming from
[34:29] God. The people who took his revelation
[34:31] from God became the living epistles
[34:34] whether known of all men for their
[34:35] generation.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you, are you the living
[34:38] epistol?
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Rather known of all men for your
[34:40] generation.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Every generation had a chance at the
[34:43] word. Amen.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; So we must become the living epistles
[34:48] &gt;&gt; for our generation.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Let's follow the thought now. When the
[34:53] Methodists failed, God raised up others.
[34:54] And so has it gone on through the years
[34:56] until in this last day. There is again
[34:59] another people in the land.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Who under their messenger
[35:04] &gt;&gt; will be the final voice to the final
[35:06] age.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:14] So if you have followed the thought who
[35:16] was speaking through Elijah
[35:20] &gt;&gt; who was speaking through Elijah
[35:22] &gt;&gt; God. Don't be afraid to say who are
[35:24] speaking through Elijah.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; God who are speaking through Moses.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; God. So to be the final voice to the
[35:32] final age who is speaking through the
[35:33] bride.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now. I can take you to Ati's
[35:37] birthday. God spoke through her heart.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:42] Amen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; So the people think we are ordinary
[35:49] people.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; But we who have come through
[35:52] justification, sanctification, baptism
[35:54] of the Holy Ghost and are now all the
[35:56] way in the headstone.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; We speak for God.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; We are the final voice to the final age.
[36:02] Let's go to the next slide there. You'll
[36:03] see what he's saying here. Yes, sir. The
[36:05] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[36:07] God. It's its own mouthpiece. So God is
[36:09] turning on her. He will confound her the
[36:12] church through the prophet and the bride
[36:14] for the voice of who will be in her.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; So why are we so
[36:23] &gt;&gt; so upset when other people are saying
[36:25] things about us?
[36:28] &gt;&gt; When we are carrying the voice of God
[36:31] &gt;&gt; yes
[36:32] &gt;&gt; the voice of God will be Does it sound
[36:35] like prophecy?
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Let's be honest.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Does this sound like prophecy? Amen.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; The voice of God will be enough.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Does it sound like, "Okay, go and do
[36:45] what you want to do. Bake me the cake
[36:46] first, but thus sayith the Lord, the
[36:48] barrel shall not run dry."
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Nor the fruit of oil.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; The voice of God will be in her. This is
[36:56] thus sayith the Lord. And if it was thus
[36:58] said the Lord then when there was no
[36:59] bride, I say the bride is now standing
[37:02] in full formation. And the voice of God
[37:04] is in the bride.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; She is the final voice to the final age.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Hallelujah.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's continue. Yes, it is. For it
[37:15] says in the last chapter of Revelation
[37:17] verse 7, the spirit and the bride.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Then again, we were telling you it's not
[37:22] the spirit and the bride is two separate
[37:24] beings. The spirit is in the bride.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; The spirit is not meant to float around
[37:31] like some ghost on the earth.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; The spirit was sent on the day of
[37:35] Pentecost to tabernacle men.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:39] Thank you.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; So when the scripture is saying the
[37:40] spirit and the bride say come, it's not
[37:43] the spirit crying out here and the bride
[37:45] is disconnected crying out here. The
[37:47] spirit is in the bride.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; In that day you shall know as I was in
[37:51] the father, the father in me, I in you,
[37:54] you in me. The spirit is now tabernacled
[37:57] in this many membered body and they are
[37:58] crying out come
[38:01] [Music]
[38:02] &gt;&gt; once more. The world will hear direct
[38:04] from God. Now watch, if it's two
[38:06] separate, spirit and bride, but they're
[38:08] going to hear once more direct from God.
[38:10] Who are they going to hear from? The
[38:11] spirit of the bride,
[38:14] &gt;&gt; they're going to hear from one being.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Because that's exactly what the second
[38:20] mystery purpose is. God
[38:22] &gt;&gt; expressing himself through his people.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; We are part of the mystery of God.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; When we reading Revelation 10:7 that
[38:28] this prophet will come and reveal the
[38:30] mystery of God, we are part of that
[38:31] mystery of God. God is now finally got
[38:34] an evil on the earth.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Every day the serpent is trying to tempt
[38:40] you,
[38:41] &gt;&gt; trying to deceive you,
[38:43] &gt;&gt; but you know what the prophet of God
[38:44] says? He sent you from heaven with a
[38:46] ring.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; We read it on Sunday.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; He sent you with the wedding band
[38:51] already from heaven.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; So that no one can flirt with you. They
[38:55] can see you spoken for.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Not only that, he said he sent you
[38:58] predestinated
[39:00] &gt;&gt; with the CG.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. which means you're already
[39:03] pregnantated.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; You already have seed in you.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; That Satan can't put his seed in you.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; There's no seed of discrepancy can come
[39:14] into this bride because he sent you
[39:16] predestinated with your wedding ring and
[39:19] with your seed.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; He said this bride will not fall. He
[39:22] wasn't going to take a chance.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Because Amen. He says Jehovah's bride
[39:27] fell.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; He said Jesus bride fell.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. through seven church ages they
[39:33] fell. But he said this bride at the end
[39:35] time, Amen. This bride that you and I
[39:37] are part of will not fall like he fell.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz God has already put his seed word in
[39:43] us.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Once more the world will hear direct
[39:46] from God as at Pentecost. So
[39:50] &gt;&gt; don't be afraid of your prophecy. Don't
[39:52] be afraid to speak
[39:54] &gt;&gt; because it is God speaking through you.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are hearing once more like
[39:59] what? Acts, we all marvel at Acts 2:38.
[40:01] Peter standing up there. He says they
[40:03] will hear once more like that.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; But they will not hear if we are silent.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; We've got to go ahead with our prophecy.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; We've got to go ahead with what the Lord
[40:12] has commissioned us to do. Thou must
[40:14] prophesy again.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; They're going to hear once more direct
[40:20] from God as at Pentecost.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; If you didn't get the whole message, how
[40:24] are they going to hear from God? God is
[40:26] veiled in you now. Hallelujah.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; But you are veiling God. You are veiling
[40:30] God.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; If we can only come to that realization,
[40:33] we will now have sacrifice.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; We will now surrender.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; So, how are they going to hear from God?
[40:45] They're going to hear from God. They
[40:47] will not hear from God unless you speak.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. He says once more
[40:52] the world the world
[40:56] &gt;&gt; will hear direct from God.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Now if they are saying God is not
[41:01] speaking which means you are silent.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. True.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. Help us.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus is not coming back on the earth
[41:10] now to speak to them.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; He's saying once more they going to hear
[41:13] from God.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Directly from God.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How can you hear directly
[41:18] from God if he himself is not here?
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. This is a serious hour people.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; How can we hear directly from God if we
[41:27] if he himself is not here?
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, can somebody just ponder on that
[41:34] thought?
[41:35] &gt;&gt; How can the world hear directly from God
[41:38] if he himself is not here?
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Then you got to ask yourself, where is
[41:44] he? And then you got to say, "He's in
[41:47] me."
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; He is in me.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; It is Christ in me.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; The hope
[41:54] &gt;&gt; of glory.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Church, it's becoming serious now.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; It's coming a serious hour when the
[42:00] responsibility is coming upon us.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you where we are failing. We
[42:04] are failing in sacrifice.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; We are failing in surrender.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; We can't surrender.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[42:14] We we exalting the flesh too much.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; But we need to crucify the flesh.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; We need to surrender our lives.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[42:22] &gt;&gt; we need to sacrifice.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Spend time in his presence and say,
[42:26] "Lord,
[42:28] &gt;&gt; kill the son of the first husband."
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Until it's no longer I that live, this
[42:36] boy must die.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; This widow's boy must die. Yes.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; And the prophet must come overshadow us
[42:44] &gt;&gt; and Christ be formed in me.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to say that this
[42:48] evening?
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together and worship him.
[42:50] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, we worship him. We give him praise.
[42:54] We give him glory. Amen.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, how powerful it is there typed in
[43:04] the first Elijah.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; And now we in the fourth Elijah's
[43:07] ministry.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:09] Then it must reproduce itself.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Son of man as must lay now. We must lay.
[43:16] That's why he says we must lay in the
[43:18] presence of the sunlight to ripen come
[43:20] into the image and likeness of the Lord
[43:21] Jesus Christ.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just talk to the Lord. Father,
[43:24] I pray Lord that you Lord, you heard
[43:26] what we said tonight. Oh God, I ask you
[43:28] to forgive me, to wash me, to cleanse
[43:30] me, to purify me, oh God. Lord, if I
[43:32] haven't allowed this full word to have
[43:34] its full effect upon my life, oh God,
[43:36] Father, I repent even now, oh God, and I
[43:38] say, Lord, help me to sacrifice more.
[43:41] Help me to give off myself more, Lord
[43:43] Jesus. Help me to consecrate my life
[43:45] more, oh God, to say, Lord, how will the
[43:48] world hear directly, oh God, except I
[43:51] speak, oh God,
[43:52] &gt;&gt; oh father, I pray, oh God, there'll be a
[43:54] mighty outpouring of your spirit, oh
[43:56] God.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; I pray, oh God, that your name will be
[43:58] glorified, oh God.
[44:01] Oh father, I pray Lord that your name
[44:03] will be glorified. Oh father, you will
[44:06] be exalted through me. Oh God, Father,
[44:08] take my life as a sacrifice and offering
[44:11] to you Lord. I pray you'll forgive and
[44:13] wash and cleanse with your precious
[44:15] blood. Oh God, forgive us where we've
[44:17] gone wrong. Lord, in the flesh where we
[44:19] failed you in our thoughts, in our
[44:20] minds, in our action, oh God, where we
[44:23] haven't, Lord, concentrated our life,
[44:25] where you give us wash us, oh God. Lord,
[44:28] I pray Lord you'll wash us through the
[44:30] waters of your word. Oh God, Lord, may
[44:33] we just sacrifice ourselves, not
[44:35] worrying what this person is saying
[44:36] about me. That person is saying about
[44:39] me. Oh, but just Lord, oh father, being
[44:42] a sacrificial lamb and being more like
[44:44] Jesus.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, though they slap me, I'll turn my
[44:49] other sheep.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No matter what men may do to
[44:52] me,
[44:54] &gt;&gt; oh father, like a lamb,
[44:56] &gt;&gt; I'm coming into your image and likeness,
[44:58] oh God.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, I give you glory. I give you praise.
[45:01] I give you honor, Father.
