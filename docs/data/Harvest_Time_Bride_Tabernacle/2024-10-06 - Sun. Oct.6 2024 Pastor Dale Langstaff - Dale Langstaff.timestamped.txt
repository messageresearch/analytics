[29:23] The Sick and and doing these different
[29:25] things and washing the disciples feet
[29:28] but they didn't like the Christ when he
[29:30] braided a

[30:26] amen thank you Lord let's read his word
[30:29] who is the image of the invisible God
[30:31] the firstborn of every creature for by
[30:35] him who all
[30:36] things created that are in heaven and
[30:40] that are in Earth that are visible and
[30:44] that are invisible whether they be
[30:45] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[30:48] or Powers things all things were created
[30:52] by Him and for him everything this
[30:55] morning is about Jesus Christ right
[30:58] everything and he is before all things
[31:01] he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning
[31:03] and the end and by him were all things
[31:06] consist you get your breath from Jehovah
[31:09] and he is the head the boss of the body
[31:12] the church who is the beginning of the
[31:14] firstborn from the dead and that in all
[31:18] things everything he might have the
[31:21] preeminence and verse 19 I love this
[31:24] part for it pleased that's right the
[31:28] father that in him should the
[31:33] fullness dwell and let's just drop to
[31:36] verse 26 and you can have your seats
[31:38] even the mystery that has been hidden

[31:46] from ages and from Generations but now
[31:50] today it's a different day but now has
[31:53] been made
[31:55] manifested to his Saints Lord Jesus we
[31:58] pray that you'll just take the veils off
[32:01] our eyes as we can see you more
[32:04] perfectly this morning and we'll praise
[32:07] and bless your name for
[32:08] it amen amen you may have your seats
[32:11] we're just going
[32:13] to scrolled past our our message here
[32:17] last Sunday and and try to find
[32:21] another sorry we're going to turn to
[32:23] Revelations
[32:25] 1:1 just read another scripture for
[32:27] Foundation there we
[32:30] go
[32:32] Hallelujah the revelation of Jesus
[32:34] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[32:39] unto his
[32:40] servants the things which must shortly
[32:44] come to pass and he sent it and he
[32:48] signified it by his Angel unto a
[32:52] servant
[32:54] John hallelujah amen we see here in the
[32:58] scripture and we're just laying a
[32:59] foundation with scriptures in here in
[33:01] John 1:1 you can turn over there if you
[33:03] want in the beginning was the word and
[33:05] the Word was with God and the Word was
[33:07] God and the same was in the beginning
[33:10] with God and all things were made by him
[33:13] you see how the scriptures are com are
[33:15] complimenting each other all things were
[33:17] made by him and without him was nothing
[33:19] made that was made and in him was life
[33:24] and the life was the light of man and
[33:28] the light shineth in darkness and the
[33:30] Darkness comprehended it not see we had
[33:33] a prayer request here you know the
[33:34] darkness can't comprehend Christ Jesus
[33:39] but in many that received him to them he
[33:43] gave power to become the
[33:46] sons even to them that believe on his
[33:50] name now I want to just stop there for
[33:51] just a second and I had a question asked
[33:54] very
[33:56] respectfully and asked me a while ago as
[33:59] about adoption and I I mentioned that
[34:01] maybe last week or last Sunday you know
[34:04] brother Brown mentioned adoption about
[34:06] 183 times and adopted 189 times and it's
[34:12] everywhere in the Bible and it's right
[34:15] here that as many as would receive him
[34:18] gave he
[34:20] power to be
[34:24] adopted power to become sons and verse
[34:26] 14 and the Word was made
[34:30] flesh and it dwelt among us you know
[34:32] brother Brown talked about the gifts of
[34:33] the spirits and he said I can show you
[34:35] in the word of God where God brought
[34:37] them into the church that's right but
[34:40] you try to show me where he took them
[34:42] out I want to show you where he took out
[34:45] Christ and the word became flesh that's
[34:48] right and dwell Among Us he never took
[34:51] that out it's walking around in his
[34:53] bride this morning in a me many membered
[34:56] bride Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[34:58] today and forever you know every
[35:00] principle and theme of the Bible is
[35:03] about Christ and everything that you
[35:05] your theme and all your thoughts and
[35:07] everything the principle should be about
[35:09] Christ everything that you dwell on you
[35:12] know the Bible says that when you rise
[35:13] up in the morning you pray to him when
[35:15] you walk around in your day it's your
[35:17] whole theme as you're making a living
[35:19] and and whatever you're doing you're
[35:21] you're calling in life and then as you
[35:23] lay down in bed and you're showing your
[35:25] children in your thing is your theme is
[35:28] Christ Christ was identified in us and
[35:31] he was identifying himself that we would
[35:32] be Christlike the word we would be the
[35:35] second Eve that wouldn't
[35:38] fall wouldn't fall from this here and
[35:40] I'm just trying to skip what I went
[35:42] through here and you know God is looking
[35:46] for people that he can have the
[35:47] preeminence amen and he says this word
[35:51] hundreds of times or dozens at least in
[35:54] this message Christ revealed in God and
[35:57] he's looking for people that God can
[36:00] consume that will take a name change and
[36:04] be Mrs Jesus Christ and nothing and we
[36:07] give examples of of Paul and Moses not
[36:11] nothing that the world could offer them
[36:13] would change their
[36:15] opinion it was completely sold out
[36:19] completely taken Christ seed it don't
[36:23] matter what happens you know I just want
[36:25] to throw this in here just in case
[36:27] anybody hasn't been watching but brother
[36:29] bam said to watch Israel I would just
[36:32] encourage you to keep watching
[36:34] Israel and you might well I almost said
[36:38] something
[36:39] mean we're going home soon am amen we're
[36:43] just going home soon I watch a short
[36:45] thing you know Israel got 180 missiles
[36:48] shot to him at one afternoon and
[36:50] Israel's one afternoon and they were
[36:52] talking about the the leader there in
[36:54] Israel that Biden keeps putting up a red
[36:56] line for him not to cross and he
[36:57] repeatedly crossed the red line with no
[37:00] circumstances and they know Israel is
[37:02] going to retaliate to Iran and they
[37:05] expect that he's going to hit the
[37:08] nuclear facilities I think they have
[37:11] about five of them that that are noted
[37:13] or whatever and Biden said you can do
[37:16] anything you want to Iran but don't hit
[37:22] them we're not going to be here for that
[37:24] nuclear war
[37:29] amen hallelujah we need to God wanted to
[37:33] express himself in Christ and secondly
[37:36] he wanted to express himself Christ
[37:39] wanted to express himself in his bride
[37:42] and have the preeminence that we are
[37:45] completely not our own completely sold
[37:50] out and then thirdly he wanted to come
[37:53] back and live in the Garden of
[37:56] Eden Je
[37:58] the second Adam Jesus Christ and his
[38:01] wife the second Eve and it'll be
[38:04] Heavenly it'll be the
[38:06] honeymoon and it'll be amazing I want to
[38:09] look into this morning and and you know
[38:12] I I mentioned this last week brother bam
[38:14] when he preached this was a 4-Hour
[38:15] message and I added a lot of parts to it
[38:19] you know brother bam I read a quote he
[38:20] said that we have thus saith the Lord we
[38:23] are we are Christ voiced in this day the
[38:26] bride know know exactly exactly the mind
[38:30] of Christ and exactly what he wants done
[38:33] with it and when amen that's how you
[38:36] know healing and and the spiritual gifts
[38:39] in the body is just like you getting
[38:41] blessed that's right you can't get
[38:43] blessed until God sends it to you and
[38:46] you can't speak thus sayith the Lord
[38:49] until he sends it to you amen amen
[38:53] hallelujah let's just look at some
[38:55] things here
[38:58] some people that were completely sold
[39:01] out and God had the complete preeminence
[39:05] and their life and one example was
[39:10] Daniel here they had been overrun by the
[39:13] king of Babylon and he have seized
[39:16] Jerusalem and he the king there
[39:18] Nebuchadnezzar ordered his his men to
[39:22] take the chosen ones of Israel's people
[39:26] back to glorify himself and and his
[39:32] God baam
[39:35] sir and you know this is an amazing
[39:38] thing that just jumped off the pages to
[39:40] me you know brother Bown said repeatedly
[39:43] that God's looking for somebody that'll
[39:44] have the preeminence if he's number
[39:49] one in everything you
[39:52] do he's the whole
[39:54] Focus you can't make a move or a
[39:57] business thing or anything without
[39:59] considering Christ's
[40:02] opinion Daniel
[40:05] here he wanted to give these
[40:08] people his
[40:10] food that was offered to idols and his
[40:14] wine and the Bible says in Daniel 8 1:
[40:19] 18 it said you know watch God wants a
[40:22] preeminence and and I want I just
[40:25] clarify something here is the Holy Ghost
[40:27] had it been given yet in Daniel's day so
[40:30] you have a piece of
[40:31] cake you have it thousands of times
[40:34] easier than Daniel had
[40:37] it and it says the scripture says that
[40:40] Daniel
[40:42] purposed in his heart d 1 Daniel 8 he
[40:45] said Daniel purpose in his heart to give
[40:48] God the
[40:49] preeminence in his life now I want to
[40:52] just clarify a few things here Daniel
[40:55] was a slave of War
[40:59] bless God and some of
[41:01] us spineless Christians will say oh well
[41:04] the government says it's legal it
[41:07] doesn't matter what the government says
[41:09] is legal if the Bible don't say it's
[41:10] legal amen we need to stand up for
[41:14] what's God's word first and respect and
[41:17] obey the government as long as it don't
[41:20] get in way of God Amen Hallelujah and
[41:25] here Daniel's a Slave
[41:27] they could have locked his head off and
[41:29] not lost a minute's
[41:31] notice and he purpose in his
[41:35] heart oh he could have went to God said
[41:37] well God you know I just had to do that
[41:40] it was sat in front of me I would have
[41:42] starved to
[41:43] death some of us are so
[41:46] cheap we'll take something given to us
[41:49] you know you know the Kings and the holy
[41:51] men in the Bible they want to take money
[41:53] from the
[41:55] devil don't be cheat don't sell your
[41:59] soul Elvis sold his soul for cheap money
[42:03] that's going to burn cheap money and a
[42:07] fleet of
[42:08] Cadillacs Daniel purposed in his heart
[42:12] that he would not
[42:14] defy himself the person of the king's
[42:20] meat nothing wrong with meat I'm a meat
[42:22] eater all the time but this was the
[42:25] king's meat
[42:29] and the King's Wine which in
[42:33] our life is type the power of the Holy
[42:36] Ghost but this was a false god
[42:40] sure which he would drink and therefore
[42:42] he requested of the
[42:45] Unix that he would not defile can you
[42:47] imagine him walking up to the can you
[42:50] just just comprehend that imagine that
[42:52] you're like in you know North Korea and
[42:54] you walk up there and say you know I I'm
[42:56] really I'm here but you know I know I'm
[42:59] in your slave prison camp but you know I
[43:01] don't want to eat your food I I I
[43:03] profess like that I you
[43:07] know we think Daniel's a great thing but
[43:10] there ain't one of us sitting here this
[43:11] morning that would have did what Daniel
[43:16] did but Christ is looking for somebody
[43:19] that he can have the
[43:20] preeminence that their whole being is
[43:22] sold out to him that he can come in and
[43:25] and be as that as wife understand
[43:28] everything that he wants and everything
[43:30] that he is and he's just yo man can you
[43:34] comprehend
[43:36] this now watch this brother baham said
[43:39] in this message that all these stories
[43:42] are tight in the Bible the whole Bible
[43:46] is wrote so it's hid from the wise and
[43:47] prudent and revealed onto babe such as
[43:50] would learn and that was God's plan was
[43:53] to find a wife and have the preeminence
[43:57] that's right for
[44:02] himself I'd say Daniel was a man of
[44:06] God and we can look down at Daniel again
[44:10] and along with him Daniel had some
[44:13] buddies and their Pagan name was given
[44:16] to them by the king and it was Shadrach
[44:19] meach and
[44:23] abedo and they were also slaves
[44:29] now watch this God's looking for
[44:31] somebody that's got a
[44:32] backbone that's got the preeminence see
[44:35] you know we said last Sunday when you've
[44:37] taken Christ seed he closes a box car
[44:41] and you can't get pregnant with the
[44:42] devil's seed anymore you're completely
[44:45] sold out I'm going to read I'm going to
[44:46] read some quotes here where he says that
[44:48] he's telling you the secrets and he's
[44:50] making love to and he says right on the
[44:53] quotes to his
[44:54] wife yeah
[44:59] and here Nebuchadnezzar made a n on I
[45:02] just love this one now you know please
[45:04] forgive me we talked on this Wednesday
[45:06] night if you missed it you just missed
[45:08] the big thing but if you want to make
[45:10] sense completely of this message go
[45:11] watch last
[45:12] Sunday and I'll and you know it will
[45:16] help
[45:17] you but
[45:20] Nebuchadnezzar the king that was Pagan
[45:23] respected Daniel so
[45:25] much you why he respected Daniel because
[45:28] he was a good honest
[45:32] worker he was what you see is what you
[45:35] get he wasn't a sneak see Daniel was
[45:38] working and laboring and living as unto
[45:40] God and the King saw that attribute in
[45:43] him you know Believers should be the
[45:46] best employees the best honest
[45:48] businessmen the best everything in the
[45:51] world don't real it don't make no
[45:54] difference if your boss is a complete
[45:55] Airhead yeah you're working as unto
[45:58] Christ and even this Pagan King seen the
[46:01] attributes of Daniel so much so that he
[46:04] sent Daniel away to take care of his
[46:06] other property that was far away land
[46:09] now our Prophet said this I'm not making
[46:12] this up you can search all this and
[46:13] brother Brown said it multiple times in
[46:15] different
[46:16] messages he built a statue of
[46:19] Daniel to worship Daniel to respect the
[46:22] attributes that were in him now watch
[46:23] this the brother bam says things like
[46:25] this he said look look at the style of
[46:29] Satan he built this Idol when Daniel was
[46:34] away he had gone home right between the
[46:38] lines
[46:39] now he had died and went
[46:42] home Daniel would have never allowed the
[46:45] worship of himself that's right but he
[46:48] wasn't there to defend it and here the
[46:51] Believers were and the king so loved
[46:54] Daniel he said I'm going to I'm going to
[46:56] blow all the he had great musicians like
[46:58] us and he said I'm going to blow all
[46:59] these instruments and you are going to
[47:01] fall down and worship them now watch
[47:03] this they had other people in the church
[47:05] that were present and there was only
[47:07] three people that had a backbone and
[47:10] that congregation and all the other
[47:12] people were jealous of those people and
[47:15] they went to the king and they said King
[47:16] Nebuchadnezzar when you blew the trumpet
[47:19] and you sounded all the music they fall
[47:20] down and worship this amazing INF that
[47:23] you've created unto yourself and for
[47:26] people to be under your headship and
[47:27] obey the laws of the land bless
[47:30] God there was three
[47:34] people that wouldn't
[47:38] obey and he brought it to their
[47:40] attention and he brought Shadrach Bach
[47:42] in the B to go up and I'm just telling
[47:44] you from memory and you can look this
[47:45] all up in Daniel 3 and he said is this
[47:48] the
[47:49] truth that thou have done you have
[47:52] actually defied now they're slaves he
[47:55] could have loed their head off he could
[47:57] have thrw a spirit through their gut
[47:59] they were Canon f as far as he was
[48:01] concerned they were they were prizes of
[48:07] War bless God we can take some examples
[48:10] from them people amen and they never had
[48:12] the B they never had the Holy Ghost
[48:14] wasn't given
[48:16] yet and I want to just read this just
[48:19] makes me lose my
[48:22] mind how they answered in verse 16 maybe
[48:25] we can pull this up girls Daniel 3:16
[48:28] and Shadrach and meach and abedo
[48:30] answered the king answered unto the king
[48:32] said oh King
[48:38] Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful how we
[48:41] come to church on Wednesday
[48:43] night we are not careful how we obey the
[48:46] word of God we are not careful how we're
[48:50] sld out we are not careful how he has a
[48:53] preeminence in our life we are not
[48:55] careful how we lose oursel in worship
[48:58] and we don't even know what's
[49:02] happened until somebody would come to us
[49:04] after and tell us in the service you
[49:06] know our Prophet said that he said I
[49:07] don't even know what I preached or sold
[49:09] go go back and listen to the tape that's
[49:11] right he said we are not even
[49:14] careful oh we answered you in this
[49:18] matter no I me just tell you what that's
[49:21] what you call walking on thin
[49:25] ice cuz he what had Legions of military
[49:28] men around

[49:39] is it's a piece of cake for him he's
[49:42] more than able to Deliver Us from your
[49:46] fanatical fiery
[49:50] furnace and he will deliver and he would
[49:53] deliver us out of your hand he would it

[50:30] she already knows what I love when she
[50:32] goes to the grocery store she brings
[50:33] cash shoes back with her she brings bags
[50:36] of cashews back with her cuz I'm
[50:38] possessed with cash

[50:59] he's oh you just don't understand you're
[51:02] looking at me like some kind of a
[51:06] religion he said he can deliver us out
[51:08] of thy hand brother B said that even the
[51:11] angels recognize this in heaven he said
[51:13] God have you been watching Facebook
[51:16] lately down on
[51:18] Earth do you do you see those three men
[51:21] down
[51:22] there they're radicals
[51:29] they're acting under
[51:34] control but they said if
[51:37] not if God decides
[51:42] not if it not be that he know on be
[51:46] known unto thee Oh King that we will not
[51:49] serve thy Gods nor will we worship oh
[51:52] here I missed the verse here I must if
[51:54] it be so that our God whom we serve is
[51:56] able to deliver so with fire
[51:58] friend but if not it be known unto thee
[52:02] King if he
[52:05] doesn't if God decides not to heal me it
[52:09] makes no difference if God decides to
[52:11] feed me Branch water and and
[52:15] tea it makes no difference if I got to
[52:19] ride a horse instead of a
[52:22] car cuz I'm sold I'm I'm completely stol
[52:26] own sold yeah he said we will not serve
[52:30] your
[52:31] Gods neither will we
[52:33] worship the golden image which was the
[52:36] Prophet Daniel yes that thou has set
[52:41] up
[52:42] wow and so here the fury of the King was
[52:47] the the the the lack of respect and
[52:50] reverence that they these these these
[52:53] mice had showed in front of King
[52:55] Nebuchadnezzar
[52:57] he he he was out of control he said make
[52:59] the fire seven times seven Church ages
[53:02] hotter do you know in this age that the
[53:05] pressure on you is seven times hotter
[53:08] yes than the first ages seven times
[53:11] because the devil knows that his time's
[53:14] almost up you might not have to watch
[53:16] Israel but I guarantee you one person
[53:18] that is and that's Satan's watching
[53:21] Israel and he knows that the days are
[53:23] almost through and he and he's going
[53:26] crazy to get this wife this second Eve
[53:29] to fall that's right come on
[53:32] now but what he don't know there's
[53:35] something Satan don't know is that it
[53:38] the second Eve cannot fall it's not
[53:41] possible because she's packing Christ
[53:46] she was predestinated before the
[53:48] foundation of the world God left nothing
[53:51] to chance even if you fall down you
[53:54] can't get repr pregnant again you're
[53:56] completely consumed with you can look at
[53:59] the men that that Christ denied Christ
[54:02] and he still used them that's
[54:05] right
[54:07] amen he made it seven times harder and
[54:10] then the Pagan King God came on the
[54:14] scenes they threw a in and the men died
[54:16] you know the story better than
[54:19] me and here a pagan King that had never
[54:22] prayed to Jehovah had never heard a
[54:25] message about Jehovah
[54:26] had never stood in front of Jehovah
[54:29] going to car going to curse Jehovah in
[54:31] his
[54:34] face said I threw in three yes complete
[54:39] Pagan you know there's Believers sitting
[54:41] in churches that don't even recognize
[54:42] that I threw in three people in that
[54:46] church and I recognize another presence
[54:49] in their atmosphere I recognize another
[54:51] presence in the church body it's the
[54:54] atmosphere of Jehovah Christ made flesh
[54:57] and dwell among
[54:59] us
[55:01] hallelujah hallelujah and it looks on to
[55:05] me like the Son of God you know I said
[55:09] it and I've said it before when I shared
[55:10] testimonies with you you know Satan will
[55:13] recognize the testimonies and the power
[55:16] of God in your life when God does stuff
[55:19] outside of the physical Norm Satan will
[55:23] pick it up oh yeah and saying that don't
[55:26] have happen in this
[55:30] realm the
[55:32] preeminence do you
[55:34] know we're so
[55:37] dignified and we're
[55:40] so
[55:42] religious that we miss the plan of God
[55:45] do you know the Bible says in 1 Peter
[55:48] 3:6 then even
[55:52] Sarah called Abraham Lord
[55:58] she recognized the
[56:00] presence of a living Christ that's right
[56:03] in his
[56:05] life there's my Lord
[56:09] amen that's been made flesh in my day
[56:13] and God's gave enough Grace and love to
[56:16] me that I'd have the
[56:20] the the
[56:22] chance
[56:24] fellowship with Christ
[56:28] with Christ made flesh I'll tell you
[56:30] what if you don't want to be in each
[56:31] other's presence you certainly won't
[56:33] want to be in heaven that's for sure cuz
[56:36] it will be
[56:38] exactly the
[56:41] same if you're disappointed in church
[56:43] life today and it's under the power of
[56:46] God and you have a and and it's under
[56:48] the leadership of Christ let's say that
[56:50] way if you're if you're disappointed
[56:52] with Church Life today and it's under
[56:54] the leadership of Christ you you're
[56:56] going to be sadly disappointed in heaven
[56:59] you do not want to
[57:01] go to that
[57:05] place because Christ will be no
[57:07] different there than he is where he has
[57:10] the preeminence watch me the
[57:13] preeminence in the lives of people in
[57:18] this
[57:20] age ain't that
[57:22] amazing God help us I want to use a
[57:26] scripture now now brother B said I I
[57:29] just I'm just I I don't want you to
[57:31] think I'm going down a long road here
[57:33] that all the Bibles
[57:36] wrote based on this love affair am I am
[57:40] I okay with that so far and it was God
[57:43] was was uh before he was even God he was
[57:46] this Spirit you know and and he became
[57:48] created the angels and he had all these
[57:50] attributes in
[57:52] them God wanted toay that into Christ
[57:56] and he wanted to portrayed in his wife
[57:59] and go back to the Garden of Eden which
[58:01] was Perfection there'll be no war in the
[58:05] Millennium there'll be no hatred in the
[58:07] Millennium it'll be straight honeymoon
[58:10] like paradise like you're more than your
[58:14] imagination and so I wanted with your
[58:17] permission to show you an example and
[58:20] just forget about the people
[58:21] representing you know I said last Sund
[58:23] it's not about the ministry it's not
[58:25] about the fivefold Ministry it's not
[58:27] just about you no more than it's about
[58:29] the
[58:31] children we're a b we're all equally
[58:34] Christ I don't have no more of Christ
[58:36] than you have not one back don't look to
[58:40] me look to yourself Christ Jesus prayed
[58:43] to the Father which was in
[58:45] himself pray to yourself it's not a far
[58:48] away God it's it's in me I'm walking
[58:51] with them I'm living with them and so
[58:55] God you know it's amazing that smart
[58:57] people can't figure out simple
[59:00] things you ever see
[59:03] that God put this so plain you know you
[59:07] know I I never went to a and and no
[59:10] we're not well I never heard tell or
[59:13] understood predestination till I came to
[59:15] this beautiful
[59:17] message and I can't do devotions without
[59:20] reading predestination I can't read a
[59:23] book or a verse of the Bible without
[59:26] seeing that I'm predestinated that I'm
[59:28] Sons and Daughters of Christ and he
[59:30] thought of me before the foundation of
[59:31] the world and we could just go into so
[59:33] many examples but I want to go into here
[59:36] here and then maybe we'll look in
[59:38] Ephesians if we get time and if we don't
[59:40] we might do another one or or do it
[59:43] Wednesday but here there was a
[59:45] story oh I hate that word story there
[59:48] was an example in the Bible of what God
[59:51] wanted to do yes amen and he's shown EX
[59:56] exactly that you understand
[59:59] 100% And Our Father Abraham oh God
[1:00:04] became an old
[1:00:06] man my kids don't understand that when
[1:00:09] you reach 55 things start happening to
[1:00:12] you you move a lot less and a lot slower
[1:00:15] that's right and this was your father
[1:00:19] Abraham just let me go here dramatize
[1:00:21] this this was Jehovah he was getting
[1:00:24] older and he wanted these attributes to
[1:00:26] be betray in him hello this is Genesis
[1:00:31] 24 and so he called up his servant which
[1:00:34] we know by scriptures was
[1:00:39] elizer like the ministry today or the
[1:00:42] prophets today and he said I want you to
[1:00:45] go and find a
[1:00:47] bride like he's looking for today that
[1:00:51] come out of her my people and be not
[1:00:52] partakers of her plagues and her sins
[1:00:56] and he said don't you dare go to the
[1:00:58] world and take one of those cheap
[1:01:01] Jezebel pieces of
[1:01:04] junk it'll be a be like driving an
[1:01:06] electric car or some piece of
[1:01:09] computerized thing the one little bug
[1:01:11] goes wrong the whole thing
[1:01:13] goes you know I was Driving My Tractor
[1:01:15] Down the other day and and and no it it
[1:01:19] it's not one of these new electric bugs
[1:01:20] you know but it must have been formed a
[1:01:23] little bit in the garden of sin and I'm
[1:01:26] cruising down the road and I got a lot
[1:01:28] of things on my
[1:01:31] mind it was cating
[1:01:34] fields and it started blasting and
[1:01:37] screaming and the caution of the
[1:01:40] caution stop top top engine oil
[1:01:45] bum I'm like holy smokes doctor's
[1:01:50] blowing
[1:01:52] up I pull it over I said
[1:01:57] I checked the AA before I started this
[1:01:59] I'm only a mile from
[1:02:03] home I start up and went a little bit
[1:02:06] further and the same thing again the
[1:02:09] C something and it said check the engine
[1:02:12] fuel filter the air filter I said wait a
[1:02:15] minute wait a minute wait a minute I
[1:02:17] that filter ain't even that old and I
[1:02:18] blow it out at least twice a year and I
[1:02:21] buy a new one every
[1:02:24] year I called the
[1:02:26] anic I sent a message up to Jehovah to
[1:02:30] Father Abraham and he said H son you
[1:02:33] don't have to worry about that that's
[1:02:35] some cheap
[1:02:37] sensor some little 50 Cent
[1:02:40] sensor that's thrown a whole bunch oft
[1:02:42] you know all it's all satan is he don't
[1:02:43] have no teeth he's some cheap sensor in
[1:02:45] the computer system and he's throwing
[1:02:48] all these caution lights to you and you
[1:02:50] got the oil in your belly which is the
[1:02:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got
[1:02:54] water in you and you got a clean filter

[1:02:57] clearly and Satan's
[1:03:01] going B up you got a
[1:03:04] crisis some cheap lie the devil Stone
[1:03:08] us and I just kept right on driving I
[1:03:11] said okay that's F you know I'm still
[1:03:14] driving it's never done it again
[1:03:17] yet I never believe
[1:03:20] lie Sor that you should stop serving God
[1:03:24] pull over to the side of the road and
[1:03:26] reconsider that's like Abraham told eler
[1:03:29] don't go to these cheap worldly people
[1:03:32] around us you know when I was in high
[1:03:35] school I was
[1:03:38] Radical and I was
[1:03:41] broke and I drove for hours across the
[1:03:45] world to find my
[1:03:48] rib and there was 12200 Jezebels in
[1:03:51] betro high
[1:03:53] school I could have took any one of them
[1:03:55] home with me if I would have flashed a
[1:03:58] little bit of Daddy's
[1:04:02] money but I knew what their character
[1:04:06] was so I went a long distance drive with
[1:04:10] no cell phones no computers the little
[1:04:15] three-speed carburetor car they had the
[1:04:17] flutter the gas B the gas station you
[1:04:20] have foot in The Brak and the foot on
[1:04:21] this gas pedal and if you had turned
[1:04:22] down
[1:04:24] to I know you kids don't understand all
[1:04:26] those things but if you ever drive a
[1:04:28] we've seen an old carburetor we've seen
[1:04:29] a car the other day and I said oh man my
[1:04:31] wife my kids could never drive that that
[1:04:33] sucker would
[1:04:34] puke they don't understand a
[1:04:37] carburetor
[1:04:40] amen and so here Al eer he said now what
[1:04:43] if what if this bride won't let the
[1:04:46] preeminence of God come in her life and
[1:04:50] he said if they won't sell out to me
[1:04:52] you're free of all your obligations you
[1:04:54] know brother Bram said that a minister
[1:04:56] just throws out the net whether you
[1:04:57] believe me or not makes very little to
[1:05:00] do with me it's just that I stay on the
[1:05:01] word I just show you the truth and it's
[1:05:04] all entirely up to you the N catches
[1:05:07] everything God is the judge God was the
[1:05:11] one that predestinated it wasn't brother
[1:05:13] Dale he predated me just like he
[1:05:15] predestinated you and so we know the
[1:05:17] story that El eer he took lots of gold
[1:05:20] from his wealthy
[1:05:23] Jehovah cuz he was Rich he was
[1:05:28] loaded god's loaded this morning you

[1:05:37] recognizing your position start writing
[1:05:39] checks start writing checks you don't
[1:05:41] have to worry about the bank calling
[1:05:42] they'll never call when they raise check
[1:05:44] from Jehovah you know when Joshua had to
[1:05:46] cross the Jordan River which was at the
[1:05:48] prim of the bank on the floody season
[1:05:50] cuz God had to hold them up just to
[1:05:51] prove glory and that the water never
[1:05:53] stopped till they stepped in it till
[1:05:54] they wrote a check that's right and then
[1:05:57] just reared
[1:06:00] up oh wow amen amen
[1:06:05] wow and he
[1:06:07] went hey Jared I got a dry well and uh
[1:06:11] he went to the well that wasn't

[1:06:38] the one that'll come out and offer me
[1:06:42] Hospitality you know hospitality is a
[1:06:46] gift given from Christ right not

[1:07:02] small confession I got it my wife don't

[1:07:24] I going to just tell you something I've
[1:07:26] watered cattle before and you have a
[1:07:29] garden thank
[1:07:31] you and I've seen cattle at one in a
[1:07:35] Time come off the grass and I would have
[1:07:37] a garden hose going the size of my thumb
[1:07:39] wide open down pressure 60 lbs pressure
[1:07:42] and they would outdrink the garden hose
[1:07:45] that would never come out I've seen that
[1:07:47] regular I could show that to you Junior
[1:07:49] we don't see it now because when I was
[1:07:51] little we were poor and we never had
[1:07:53] water drinkers so we had to stand there
[1:07:55] for days watering the cattle cuz my dad
[1:07:57] had tanks but my kids miss those not
[1:08:00] privileg they got water drinkers so they
[1:08:01] never see a Thirsty Camel but anybody
[1:08:04] that Waters camels that come across the
[1:08:07] desert
[1:08:10] hello the little bucket that she'd pull
[1:08:13] up under that
[1:08:14] well she would have needed to see a
[1:08:17] choir practor when she got done pulling
[1:08:19] up the water now I'm just being I mean
[1:08:21] we we love these these These are truths
[1:08:26] yes can you imagine how cold it was she
[1:08:28] wasn't in air she was working like a
[1:08:32] dog she would have smelt like a dog
[1:08:36] too but she had
[1:08:38] character and he said hey you don't hear
[1:08:40] all the user said he said do you got
[1:08:42] room watch this watch how he says this
[1:08:45] you know God wrote everything to hide it
[1:08:48] I I'm I'm breaking this down God I'm
[1:08:49] unveiling God for you he said elzer said
[1:08:52] he said you got room in your home your
[1:08:55] heart for
[1:08:56] me for my Lord he said you got room in
[1:09:00] your home does your daddy have room in
[1:09:02] your
[1:09:04] home for my camels and my gifts that I'm
[1:09:08] bringing let me ask you something do you
[1:09:10] got room in your heart for the gifts
[1:09:12] that Christ wants to give you you don't
[1:09:16] have to take them but do you have room
[1:09:18] in your home and you know the Bible says
[1:09:21] that as they were entering the room that
[1:09:23] the son the brother recognize the
[1:09:27] gifts that the damsel was packing on her
[1:09:30] bracelets and her necklaces and you know
[1:09:33] brother B said this and I I if I slow
[1:09:36] down enough to read the quote but I just
[1:09:37] tell you he said it was the mother and
[1:09:40] the brother that tried to stop her
[1:09:42] Rebecca from going and he said one
[1:09:45] represented now this is not this is not
[1:09:47] paraphrased here okay one's going to
[1:09:50] insult the church and one's going to
[1:09:52] insult the minister he said the mother
[1:09:54] represented the Catholic Church
[1:09:55] church that's not us and the other one
[1:10:00] the brother represented the ministers
[1:10:03] that don't want to give you the full
[1:10:04] word of what Christ is in you the hope
[1:10:07] of glory and that don't represent me
[1:10:10] that's the ministers that try to raise
[1:10:12] them up above the people and become a
[1:10:14] lord or a priesthood over that's cheap
[1:10:17] garbage they're your brother and your
[1:10:19] sister in a different calling amen
[1:10:22] that's all it is and you watch this so
[1:10:25] so we see here that they came and they
[1:10:29] represented and they realized and they
[1:10:32] wanted to to to to stop
[1:10:35] Rebecca and hold her up for 10
[1:10:38] days and they wanted they wanted her to
[1:10:41] understand that she she couldn't hear
[1:10:43] from God till the end of Revival she
[1:10:45] couldn't get what God wanted her to get
[1:10:47] in the first service or she couldn't get
[1:10:49] what she wanted in her own home even or
[1:10:52] praying to herself he they were trying
[1:10:54] to build a a kingdom around
[1:10:59] Rebecca and eler said you're
[1:11:03] hindering
[1:11:05] God you're holding
[1:11:07] up
[1:11:09] God I pray to God that we're not holding
[1:11:11] up
[1:11:13] God I I pray to God that when somebody
[1:11:16] gets blessed so we don't hope them that
[1:11:17] they would shut up so we could go on
[1:11:19] with the service we're holding up God I
[1:11:23] pray to God that when somebody has a
[1:11:24] blessing in her life we just well I
[1:11:26] don't want to hear that cuz I want to
[1:11:28] get on with my life I pray to God that
[1:11:31] we never get to the point that we don't
[1:11:32] even have time to to to set aside time
[1:11:35] to to hear from God and Christ and the
[1:11:37] scriptures and all this that we're so
[1:11:38] busy building our
[1:11:41] kingdom that's going to burn probably in
[1:11:45] a few
[1:11:46] months
[1:11:53] literally and let's turn to Genesis 24
[1:11:56] and
[1:11:57] 55 and the Brethren said let her stay a
[1:12:00] few days at least
[1:12:02] 10 and after that we'll let you we'll
[1:12:05] let you serve God after you've seated
[1:12:07] your Wild
[1:12:10] Oats and he said unto them hinder not
[1:12:13] seeing that the Lord has prospered my
[1:12:15] way and sent me away that I may go to my
[1:12:18] master and verse 57 and they said well
[1:12:21] we'll call the damsel and we'll inquire
[1:12:23] of her
[1:12:25] God's doing that right now to you guys
[1:12:29] he's calling you up since the foundation
[1:12:32] of the world and he's
[1:12:33] saying what do you
[1:12:36] say God is as big as what you confess
[1:12:39] confess believe with your heart confess
[1:12:41] with your mouth amen that he is living
[1:12:45] inside you that you're sold out that
[1:12:47] you're his wife and that and and they so
[1:12:50] they called the damsel and inquired of
[1:12:52] her at her
[1:12:56] mouth and they called Rebecca and said
[1:12:59] unto her wilt thou

[1:13:06] man and I want to just show you

[1:14:42] about him and you know the famous
[1:14:45] scripture she said I will
[1:14:47] go I will go and so they changed their
[1:14:52] thing and fast forward everything and of
[1:14:55] course they prepared for the trip and
[1:14:58] you know I want to just dramatize it a
[1:15:01] bit Rebecca is going on an Earthly trip

[1:15:13] end very
[1:15:15] soon and you're going to travel across
[1:15:17] the desert called The
[1:15:20] Rapture and there's going to be somebody
[1:15:22] standing over there called Christ Jesus
[1:15:25] that you ain't never seen in the flesh
[1:15:26] with your own
[1:15:27] eyes and he's going to be walking out in

[1:15:46] could say I'll serve him unconditionally
[1:15:49] you know how you can serve
[1:15:51] Christ is because you are a blood
[1:15:55] relative you're Jehovah God you came
[1:15:59] from God and you'll go back to God you
