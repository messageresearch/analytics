[30:30] some water
[30:32] I get real dry when I start talking
[30:35] but anyways the trial of your faith
[30:40] and I was thinking I was going to speak
[30:42] on
[30:44] um
[30:48] forget the title my title there
[30:50] basically it was what I was going to
[30:52] speak on originally and maybe we'll end
[30:54] up going there who knows
[30:56] I'm just going to talk right now
[30:59] and what I was going to speak on was I
[31:02] was I had taken a subject where
[31:04] where the disciples in Jesus had been
[31:07] out and had been amongst a great a great
[31:10] Revival they had a great revival going
[31:12] on people were being healed they were
[31:14] out and they were going from town to
[31:16] town and people were being healed people
[31:18] were being saved people were coming to
[31:20] Christ and all that and then they went
[31:21] out for a time of rest onto a boat and
[31:23] they were just out there relaxing it and
[31:26] all of a sudden this great wave and this
[31:28] great wind came up that they were so
[31:31] much so that they were in Jeopardy that
[31:32] their lives were in Jeopardy that they
[31:34] were about to lose their lives and what
[31:36] they were done they had been and and
[31:38] Revival and everything had been going
[31:40] great and the word had been going great
[31:42] in their life and and they had been
[31:44] they'd seen great Miracles and had great
[31:46] things going on and they had great
[31:48] expectations of things to come and the
[31:50] next thing they know they found
[31:51] themselves in Peril they found
[31:53] themselves in the middle of a sea that
[31:55] was rough they found themselves in the
[31:57] middle of a trial that was rough they
[31:59] found themselves in a place where they
[32:00] were about to drown where they were
[32:02] about to go under when they had lost
[32:04] sight of the Lord they had lost sight of
[32:06] who he was they had lost sight of
[32:08] everything in their life they had lost
[32:09] side of everything that they had heard
[32:11] it's Satan had brought a great trial
[32:13] upon their lives
[32:14] and they were about to drown and they
[32:16] were in great Jeopardy
[32:25] in this last 2020
[32:30] let me say this before I forget
[32:32] bring greetings from True Word
[32:33] Tabernacle in Bluffton Ohio
[32:37] and the Saints there and our pastor
[32:40] brother Wayne Lawson
[32:42] and our senior pastor Brother Ray
[32:44] Erickson were in the midst of a
[32:46] transition between
[32:47] the I don't know how to say it
[32:51] Brother Ray founded the church and and
[32:53] he was he's been the pastor
[32:56] and he's 84 years old
[33:00] so he's wanting to slow down
[33:03] not quit
[33:04] but just slow down
[33:06] the other church has asked him to come
[33:07] and evangelist to their Church
[33:10] and uh
[33:11] just kind of
[33:13] a joke there because as a pastor he
[33:15] never traveled out much
[33:18] there for so many years and they had him
[33:20] down to minister and they're like why
[33:22] don't you become an evangelist now
[33:24] but no we're we're happy to have brother
[33:26] Wayne as our uh Pastor now and we're
[33:29] we're starting to see more of him he's
[33:31] coming off the field and becoming
[33:33] stepping into that role as pastor and
[33:36] and uh but this weekend he's in
[33:38] Switzerland preaching meetings so
[33:40] uh most of our ministers are out
[33:42] somewhere I'm up here we got some in the
[33:46] South we got a brother in London as in
[33:48] London England
[33:50] and uh
[33:51] so we're growing but last year was a
[33:54] it started out really good and strong
[33:57] and powerful we're coming out of you
[34:00] know all the covert restrictions and all
[34:01] that but in about June we
[34:06] I went with a brother down he was
[34:08] preaching down in Dayton and I went down
[34:10] there and on the way back I got some of
[34:11] the
[34:13] some news I didn't like to hear we had a
[34:15] young couple this an awesome young
[34:17] couple in our
[34:18] Charlie and Rachel and
[34:20] and got news that they were in their
[34:23] house and the house blew up
[34:25] they had been married for about about to
[34:27] celebrate their second anniversary I
[34:29] think it was
[34:30] and
[34:32] find out they think she might have been
[34:33] pregnant
[34:34] and they had their whole lives ahead of
[34:36] them
[34:37] very well liked couple in the church
[34:40] all sudden
[34:42] they're gone
[34:45] but they were ready to go
[34:50] and then a month later we were at a
[34:52] wedding
[34:53] and this is the brother that brother Tom
[34:55] Sproles and sister Sharon Sproles
[34:57] they've become dear friends of ours and
[35:00] and uh
[35:04] they uh
[35:06] they we had a wedding at our church on a
[35:07] Sunday after service
[35:09] and on the way home their son give you
[35:12] some background their son had been away
[35:14] from the Lord their oldest son and him
[35:17] and his wife and his girls
[35:19] and boys
[35:21] so they have three girls and one boy
[35:24] and they were on their
[35:27] they'd just come back into church and I
[35:30] think was it that Sunday that she got up
[35:32] and testified that they were back and
[35:34] more than one before or something like
[35:36] that
[35:37] but they would come and I remember I'd
[35:40] met him we went to up to their house for
[35:42] Fourth of July picnic and
[35:46] and
[35:48] I had met her son for the first time
[35:50] there
[35:51] was a little bit younger than me
[35:53] his dad's a little bit older with me I
[35:54] think
[35:55] you and Tom are about the same age
[35:57] brother Dale
[35:59] and uh
[36:00] actually time I think's a little bit
[36:02] older
[36:03] but um
[36:05] we have become part of the Met his son
[36:08] and I remember I was
[36:10] and his son wasn't really coming to
[36:12] church at the time and
[36:13] and this this has nothing to do with me
[36:17] this is what I was told
[36:19] this is a testimony given to me
[36:22] but I want it to be a testimony that you
[36:24] guys could take home
[36:27] because you're more important than you
[36:29] think you are
[36:31] your witness is more important than you
[36:33] think you are
[36:36] and
[36:38] we hit it kind of off because we we're
[36:40] out alike
[36:41] and a lot of the stuff that he likes
[36:43] Hunting Fishing and all that kind of
[36:45] stuff and more of a hillbilly type guy
[36:48] and
[36:51] I enjoyed it but to me I wanted to be
[36:54] enlightened with us because I want to
[36:55] see him back in church
[36:57] and I remember I found out he worked at
[37:00] the AutoZone in Bryan Ohio and I just
[37:03] happened
[37:04] my second home was up in that area
[37:06] because of work I spent a lot of time up
[37:08] in northwest Ohio
[37:11] so I was like well I'm just going to
[37:12] start stopping in I'll say hi let him
[37:14] know that somebody at church is
[37:16] actually interested him and all that and
[37:19] and so I I decided I'd stop by and say
[37:22] hi to him and
[37:25] and just just say hey not not even
[37:29] didn't talk anything
[37:31] there and it's like I just want to stop
[37:32] in and say hi and all that and
[37:34] I find out later that's so impressed him
[37:38] that somebody would take their time to
[37:40] stop by his work to say hi
[37:42] and I remember
[37:44] when they started coming back to church
[37:46] it come a few Sundays and
[37:49] and uh
[37:50] remember he's like I was about to leave
[37:53] but I had to go say hi
[37:55] go shake the guy the guy that would stop
[37:57] and say hi to me
[37:59] and then we come up so we lost the two
[38:02] young the young couple there and
[38:04] beginning of June then come around June
[38:06] 30th on the way home from uh
[38:10] the wedding
[38:12] they're in one he's in a vehicle with
[38:14] his it's him his daughter middle
[38:17] daughter and his wife and then the back
[38:20] is his oldest daughter and his son and
[38:22] the youngest daughter
[38:24] and they're driving along and
[38:27] then Tom and Sharon and behind them they
[38:29] live about an hour a little bit over an
[38:31] hour away from church
[38:33] so they left the service a little bit
[38:35] early so
[38:37] on the way up
[38:39] a drunk driver
[38:41] swerves in their Lane
[38:43] loses troll flips over
[38:45] truck lands perfectly on top of him
[38:47] kills him instantly
[38:50] and uh
[38:52] we were at the wedding we get I get word
[38:55] and I'm like I've got to go to this go
[38:58] there
[38:59] and this is where I found
[39:02] when you look at a minister especially a
[39:05] pastor
[39:07] and this is to help you understand what
[39:09] a pastor goes through
[39:11] they're the ones that are getting the
[39:13] calls at four in the morning
[39:15] there's been an accident
[39:17] they're the ones going up to a hospital
[39:19] room and
[39:20] I went to the hospital room I sat with
[39:22] an eight-year-old boy
[39:25] who kept asking me or telling me I
[39:27] wonder how my dad's doing I wonder how
[39:29] this is going on I wonder how this is
[39:31] going on
[39:32] and I know I already knew his dad's gone
[39:36] I said and you're sitting there with an
[39:38] eight-year-old boy
[39:40] and I we had sent our two daughters went
[39:43] with some friends I mean instantly we're
[39:45] like
[39:46] figure out and they ended up spending a
[39:48] night at these friends and all that and
[39:50] and so we're up there until about two I
[39:53] think we got home to 2 33 in the morning
[39:54] something like that and
[39:56] you know the next morning I wanted to
[39:59] before I went to work I went
[40:10] it makes you appreciate your family
[40:15] and then remember your pastor here
[40:19] everybody relies on him
[40:21] when there's a hard time when there's
[40:22] sickness when there's some kind of trial
[40:24] going on
[40:25] just lift him up in prayer
[40:28] I got to see firsthand what it was like
[40:31] until what it was like to be in that
[40:33] position
[40:34] I'd never experienced that before
[40:36] administered many times
[40:38] but I've never stepped into that side of
[40:40] the ministry
[40:42] and that side of the ministry is
[40:43] actually more prevalent than the
[40:45] preaching
[40:46] because it's an everyday Ministry
[40:49] preachings once twice three to four
[40:52] times a week maybe
[40:54] but
[40:55] that's an offshoot but this is this
[40:57] family here brother Thomas this is
[40:59] Sharon said they did that and then
[41:03] probably going to miss
[41:04] then they've had some other
[41:07] family member members that have come and
[41:09] passed
[41:10] their daughter-in-law is pretty much
[41:11] walked away from the message now
[41:13] she was all in it she's the one that
[41:16] stood up and
[41:17] friend of the church and testified we're
[41:19] back
[41:21] and she's gone trying to pull the kids
[41:25] away
[41:26] and trying to keep them from the
[41:27] grandparents so they're going through a
[41:29] whole lot
[41:30] just found out his mom has colon cancer
[41:34] she's up for surgery here Monday and
[41:37] it's just like boom boom boom boom
[41:39] but he's also the one
[41:41] that when he was standing out there
[41:44] brother his cousin Taz when he showed up
[41:48] at the accident scene
[41:51] he looked over and there was a double
[41:53] rainbow
[41:54] and an eagle right in the middle of it
[41:57] you got that picture and he was showing
[42:00] it to Tom
[42:01] and Tom described it he said it was like
[42:04] something just come flying right right
[42:06] into his chest
[42:08] and that's when he knew that he knew
[42:10] that he knew him
[42:11] that he had the Holy Spirit
[42:14] I would turn around and baptize 10
[42:16] people
[42:17] like a week or two later that whole
[42:19] family
[42:20] it was a privilege
[42:22] and we're believing the grandkids will
[42:25] be safe even though
[42:28] I don't know what to say about the
[42:29] daughter-in-law and it's a lot of stress
[42:31] and all that
[42:32] I'll give her the benefit of the doubt
[42:34] that she's not there
[42:36] mentally and all that but
[42:41] we're getting ready to come up here and
[42:44] I said this Wednesday but
[42:48] Monday the Monday before the leave on
[42:50] Wednesday because some are here and I'd
[42:52] like to see faces I don't recognize but
[42:54] God bless you all it's good to see you
[42:57] but anyways
[43:00] so we're getting ready to leave and
[43:02] Sonya's like the car made some kind of
[43:04] clunk and I was like that'd be nothing
[43:05] and it's a Tuesday I got home from work
[43:07] and and I'm trying to catch things up at
[43:09] work and I'm getting home late and and
[43:12] this and all right or as Monday I did
[43:15] that and
[43:16] yeah it was Monday
[43:17] and I come home and I took it over to
[43:20] work because we have nice big parking
[43:21] lots she said when you make a sharp
[43:22] right turn at clunks and I'm going
[43:25] around circles next thing I know I lose
[43:26] all my power steering
[43:28] and our only other vehicle that's
[43:30] roadworthy
[43:31] is only holds three people comfortably
[43:35] and I wouldn't trust it to come to
[43:36] Canada
[43:38] so we're like
[43:40] we still want to go and we're wondering
[43:42] what to do and
[43:44] and the next morning Sonia gets a text
[43:47] have Mike call Tom
[43:49] immediately oh another thing that
[43:52] happened to that family before I get
[43:53] into that
[43:54] so I get a call one day
[43:57] one of their
[43:59] another granddaughter from another side
[44:01] of the family was hit by a semi truck
[44:03] run over
[44:04] semi truck was making a turn didn't see
[44:06] the kids standing there she's 15.
[44:09] back wheels he got out and it was still
[44:12] sitting on her she's alive
[44:14] she's got a lot of physical therapy
[44:16] ahead of her so they're just one thing
[44:18] after another after another after
[44:20] another but you know Tom's kept a
[44:22] positive attitude
[44:24] and what Satan's thought for evil is
[44:27] actually drawing him closer to the Lord
[44:30] his walk has changed he's at peace he
[44:34] finally got a piece because he was just
[44:35] so torn up or losing his best friend his
[44:37] son
[44:38] now he's in one service a few weeks ago
[44:42] I wasn't there but through the ministry
[44:44] and all that a piece like the past
[44:46] that's all understandings come into it
[44:49] and so here we come and amidst all that
[44:53] he hears about her car and he's like I
[44:56] ain't going to let Satan get one up on
[44:58] that he goes you want our truck take it
[45:02] so I drove the hour and something to his
[45:04] house and picked up his truck and all
[45:06] that and
[45:07] and you know Satan he doesn't like when
[45:10] you or him helping the ministry or
[45:13] helping the bride and all that so we get
[45:16] a call on our way up
[45:18] hey a tree fell in our house
[45:21] crushed back side of their house
[45:24] but you know what
[45:26] he still just
[45:29] ready to give Satan a black guy
[45:31] and he's not going to playing but he
[45:34] asked me to give you all that testimony
[45:36] and and I thought it would be beneficial
[45:39] because a lot of times we think that
[45:41] we've gone through a whole lot of Trials
[45:42] we've gone through a whole lot of hard
[45:44] trials and all that but there's always
[45:46] somebody that's going through something
[45:47] worse than we are
[45:49] and his attitude through this whole
[45:51] thing he's never cursed God foolishly
[45:54] remember in job when job was going
[45:56] through all those trials his wife said
[45:57] why don't you curse God and die
[46:00] and he said oh thou speakest as a
[46:03] foolish woman
[46:04] she wasn't a foolish woman because you
[46:06] know what and that's what our subject
[46:08] matters will be here shortly she was a
[46:10] part of job
[46:12] so she couldn't be a fool
[46:15] she couldn't be cast off because the
[46:17] fool was cast off
[46:18] but why speakers there was a foolish
[46:20] woman
[46:22] and job never cursed God amongst you
[46:25] think Joe boss's children he lost his
[46:28] animals he lost his houses he lost his
[46:30] land he just saw so much and all that
[46:33] but God gave him back
[46:35] double
[46:37] even eight more kids on this side eight
[46:40] on that side
[46:41] double
[46:42] if they'd give him double here that
[46:44] would have been what quadruple triple
[46:48] but anyways all that
[46:52] to say that God is good
[46:54] and when you're in the midst of a trial
[46:56] count it all joy
[46:59] and that and the uh I cherish your kids
[47:05] cherish your family
[47:07] cherish cherish one another in the in
[47:10] the body
[47:11] you're not guaranteed tomorrow
[47:15] you're not guaranteed that after you
[47:17] walk out of here you'll be here tomorrow
[47:18] morning for service
[47:22] and I remember thinking I wanted to go
[47:24] see my kids
[47:26] that was one of the toughest things I've
[47:28] ever done be up there in the hospital
[47:30] but I kind of did privilege I was able
[47:33] to go and minister to the body
[47:35] to minister to to a family
[47:38] that that needed help at that time
[47:42] and
[47:44] I would have done it as a friend or I
[47:46] didn't do it just because I'm a minister
[47:48] but and you Minister one to another
[47:53] one to another
[47:55] and we're gonna
[47:57] go over here to Mark chapter four
[48:00] I'll give you the the the
[48:03] chapter this time I was told that I
[48:07] didn't
[48:08] we're gonna pick up where I left off
[48:10] Wednesday and I'll do some review for
[48:12] those of you who aren't Wednesday
[48:14] and
[48:16] just kind of a
[48:21] I was going to go into
[48:25] the subject matter Overcoming By he who
[48:27] was in you a reality amongst chaos
[48:29] that's where some of what I just talked
[48:32] came out of
[48:33] and
[48:36] actually it's going to be Mark chapter
[48:38] five
[48:39] I brought up the wrong notes there Mark
[48:42] chapter 5 verse
[48:43] 35
[48:50] and I guess I ought to get there too if
[48:52] I'm going to read it
[48:56] actually I think
[49:03] and we'll start at verse 35.
[49:06] while he gets fake they're
[49:09] they're came from the Roar of the
[49:11] synagogue's house certain which said thy
[49:13] daughter is dead why trouble style the
[49:15] master any further
[49:17] and as soon as Jesus heard the word that
[49:19] was spoken he saith unto the ruler of
[49:21] the synagogue Be not Afraid only believe
[49:24] there we see Be not Afraid only believe
[49:26] we were talking about that and I know
[49:28] you all don't mind if I take this off
[49:38] I feel a little constricted in it
[49:40] sometimes
[49:41] then it gets hot
[49:43] be not afraid
[49:46] only believe
[49:49] and he suffered no man to follow him say
[49:51] Peter and James and John the brother of
[49:53] James remember he was putting out all
[49:54] unbelief when they got there they
[49:57] ridiculed him
[49:58] because he said she wasn't dead
[50:04] and he came to the house of the ruler of
[50:06] synagogue and he seeth the tumult and
[50:08] then that wept and wailed greatly
[50:12] and when he was coming he says and then
[50:14] why Makia it's a do and Weep the
[50:17] damsel's not dead but Sleepless
[50:19] why make you do and Weep the bride's Not
[50:22] Dead
[50:24] she never was dead
[50:26] it might look like she fell asleep at a
[50:28] for a period of time it might look like
[50:30] Satan put up that last nail in the
[50:32] coffin for a period of time when
[50:33] everybody's making fun of her when
[50:35] everybody's ridiculing her when
[50:37] everything's coming against her it might
[50:38] look like she's on her last breath about
[50:40] to go into the ground and about to die
[50:42] but he says why weep thou because she's
[50:44] not dead she may just be asleep but
[50:46] she's going to rise
[50:50] and they laughed him to scorn but he had
[50:53] put them all out and he take the father
[50:54] and the mother into dams on them that
[50:56] were with him and entered in where the
[50:58] damsel was lying
[51:06] and he took the damsel by the hand and
[51:07] said unto her talitha Kumai
[51:09] which is being interpreted damsel I say
[51:12] unto thee arise
[51:13] and straightway the damsel Rose and
[51:15] walked for she was
[51:18] for she was of the age of 12 years and
[51:20] they were astonished with great
[51:21] astonishment you know in this last stage
[51:23] the bride is going to rise it says and
[51:26] Isaiah chapter 60 verse 1 it says arise
[51:29] and shine for thy light has come and in
[51:32] this last stage the bride has to come
[51:34] and she has to ride and she has to shine
[51:38] and the world's going to be astonished
[51:40] that God is still alive and that he's
[51:43] still moving and that he's still working
[51:45] through flesh today because the
[51:47] denominations are dead people in the
[51:49] message are dead they've did away with
[51:51] the power of God and they've walked into
[51:53] their own thoughts and they've walked
[51:54] into their own ways and they've created
[51:56] this these programs and everything that
[51:58] have no life to them and people around
[52:00] this world they did not see much life in
[52:03] the name of Christianity today because
[52:05] of what the denominations have done and
[52:07] even in the message of the hour today
[52:09] they so polluted it they've so sad to
[52:12] where they've got their eyes on a man
[52:14] they've got their eyes on a man and the
[52:17] bride and instead of the bride and
[52:19] instead of the word that was come forth
[52:20] they're so fixated on the prophet that
[52:23] they forget that the word is still
[52:25] moving and it's still going forth and
[52:27] it's still going in power and it's still
[52:29] got a message to it and it's still going
[52:31] to be going into flesh that flesh it was
[52:33] in the prophet we're not doing away with
[52:35] the Prophet The Prophet is important
[52:37] the prophet is needful he brought a
[52:39] message to us this day he brought us a
[52:42] message so that we could live so that we
[52:43] can have power so that we can walk in
[52:46] the Name of Christ so that we can be his
[52:48] embodiment on Earth so that we could be
[52:50] the bride of Christ he came and he gave
[52:52] us a message he gave us all that we ever
[52:54] needed so that we could step into that
[52:56] role
[52:57] in this last day
[53:00] to be the final voice to the final wage
[53:03] there's got to be a final voice to an
[53:05] age that's going to be the last age
[53:07] there's got to be a voice that's alive
[53:09] if you ever heard a dead corpse speak I
[53:12] have never heard a corpse speak in my
[53:13] entire life I've been to a lot of
[53:15] funerals and they lay there
[53:22] so there's got to be a living breathing
[53:24] Christ on Earth today
[53:27] it's got to be something that you can
[53:29] see it's got to be something that you
[53:31] could touch it's got to be something
[53:33] that you can feel
[53:36] it's got to be something that you can
[53:38] see Christ manifested through
[53:42] a final voice to the final age and we're
[53:45] coming up to a final wage darkness is
[53:47] all around us the world is falling apart
[53:50] people are walking away from the word of
[53:52] God they're going to strange Gods
[53:54] they're going to strange religions
[53:55] they're going to dead religious they're
[53:57] going to just just just listening to a
[53:59] voice on a tape
[54:03] not the fresh kill that comes from the
[54:05] fivefold ministry
[54:10] then they want to take the guy that was
[54:12] flesh they want to make him infallible
[54:13] and say that everything he said and
[54:16] everything that he'd done was perfect
[54:18] I'm here to tell you he was not perfect
[54:21] there was no Prophet ever perfect
[54:25] Abraham lied
[54:28] David committed adultery
[54:32] Paul persecuted the Christians
[54:39] and if you remember Wednesday we were
[54:40] going through Esther
[54:42] and we came up to vashti
[54:46] and vashti
[54:50] just for review and I'm just gonna
[54:52] instead of reading it I'm just going to
[54:53] tell you what it is just bring everybody
[54:56] up to speed here
[54:57] so remember the king is that King Xerxes
[55:00] was having a big feast and and he was
[55:02] making everything that he loved and
[55:04] everything that he'd done known he was
[55:06] showing all his riches he was showing
[55:08] all his glory it was showing all his
[55:09] Beauty he was showing everything and it
[55:12] came down to where he had one more thing
[55:14] he wanted to show the world one more
[55:16] thing everything else was out in the
[55:18] open everything else everybody could see
[55:20] they could see the big castles they
[55:22] could see the signs they could see the
[55:24] Miracles they could see the tongues they
[55:26] could see the interpretation they could
[55:28] see all the beauty of Christ in that
[55:31] manifestation but there was still one
[55:33] mystery it had not come out yet there
[55:35] was still one mystery that had not been
[55:37] shown and that was what was inside of
[55:39] him the whole time you go back to Adam
[55:42] and Eve in the garden when Adam was
[55:44] created he was one there was two beings
[55:47] inside of him and nobody could see the
[55:50] beauty of the mystery that laid aside
[55:52] him until Christ until the Lord took it
[55:54] took Eve out of her and made two bodies
[56:00] so here we are
[56:03] we see xers he's having a big feast and
[56:06] all that and he's standing there and
[56:08] he's in plain view Christ has been in
[56:10] plain view for years Christ came in
[56:13] playing views at the beginning when he
[56:14] stepped up to the cross and when he died
[56:16] and he gave himself and that beauty in
[56:19] that love but it's not even was a
[56:21] mystery inside of it was a bride
[56:24] and she was hidden away in him until the
[56:27] last age all the church ages all the
[56:31] messengers came so that she could be
[56:33] presented to him
[56:37] so that he could present her to the
[56:39] world
[56:40] those nurses is here he sends vashti the
[56:44] queen he sends her seven Church ages he
[56:46] sends her seven Church Messengers and
[56:48] when those seven Church messages and
[56:50] that said wasn't showed up she refused
[56:52] to come forth she didn't care about him
[56:55] she didn't care about being part of
[56:58] Christ all she cared about was the glory
[57:00] all she cared about was the signs and
[57:03] the waters and Sam and the message it's
[57:06] saying I have a prophet that's all they
[57:08] were worried about
[57:13] the message has stepped forth out of the
[57:16] prophet and stepped forth into the bride
[57:17] she is the message today
[57:21] she is the final voice to this last
[57:23] stage
[57:28] and there's nothing Satan can do about
[57:30] it
[57:33] but you look at vashti
[57:36] he sent her seven Messengers
[57:43] to bring her
[57:45] forth to put her on display
[57:48] but she said I'm above being on display
[57:50] I'm above being Christ
[57:53] 's display and above showing Christ in
[57:56] my life
[57:57] but she wanted the riches she wanted the
[58:00] tongues and interpretation she wanted
[58:01] the Miracles she wanted all the benefits
[58:04] of living in Christ comes
[58:06] how many times in our own lives we want
[58:08] all the benefits of living with her
[58:10] Christ we want eternal life we want all
[58:12] that we want the healings we honor that
[58:14] but when it comes to living a life and
[58:16] showing it manifesting it we stopped
[58:18] there A lot of times because we're
[58:20] embarrassed because we're we're
[58:22] embarrassed of our groom because we were
[58:24] a little bit different it'll make us
[58:26] different than everybody around us it'll
[58:28] put us on its display and we'll become a
[58:30] peculiar person he said we are peculiar
[58:32] people
[58:34] he said we are peculiar people
[58:38] I want to be peculiar I don't care what
[58:41] this world says I don't care what they
[58:42] say but I want to be on display for
[58:45] Christ because it's not me that I want
[58:47] to show it's him it's what's behind me
[58:49] it's what's living through me that I
[58:51] know what's been shown in this world
[58:54] oh I can go show my calendar all the
[58:56] time but you know what they're going to
[58:57] see they're going to see faults they're
[58:59] going to send failures they're going to
[59:00] see per a person who gets upset they're
[59:02] going to be the same person against the
[59:04] Press they're going to see a person
[59:05] against anxiety they're going to see a
[59:07] person against afraid but if I show
[59:08] Christ here's none of those I'll have a
[59:11] boldness that I can step in the face of
[59:13] Satan and I can say is thus saith the
[59:16] Lord said you get behind me I have no
[59:18] fear I have no anxiety I have no
[59:21] depression I have no kids I have no high
[59:23] blood pressure it's got to go in the
[59:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:27] story
[59:32] what are you doing with Christ in your
[59:34] life are you let him hiding back here
[59:36] because you're afraid of him because you
[59:38] don't want to be a computer person
[59:40] because you don't want to stand out
[59:43] I'm sorry live for Christ you're going
[59:45] to stand out
[59:53] if you're going to live for Christ
[59:55] and his Christ his life shines through
[59:58] you
[59:59] you're not going to be able to take
[1:00:01] homosexuality you're not going to be
[1:00:03] able to take transitionalism you're not
[1:00:05] going to take all the religions come
[1:00:07] into one
[1:00:15] you're not going to be able to take all
[1:00:16] the part in
[1:00:22] so vashti refused the seven churches
[1:00:25] vastly refused the seven Church
[1:00:27] Messengers
[1:00:29] vastly refused the Malachi 4 5 6 and 7
[1:00:32] message
[1:00:34] that would take her
[1:00:37] vashti
[1:00:41] had she came forth
[1:00:46] she would have had up to half of the
[1:00:48] Kingdom in equality with Christ
[1:00:52] 50 50 proposition
[1:00:54] when you read we'll read here and ask
[1:00:56] her a little bit
[1:00:57] he said Esther
[1:00:59] what would you need up to half of my
[1:01:01] kingdom
[1:01:05] half 50 50.
[1:01:08] she is him
[1:01:14] she is him
[1:01:21] so she was cast out
[1:01:24] if you don't receive the message of the
[1:01:26] hour guess what you're going to be cast
[1:01:27] out
[1:01:31] and there went forth a decree
[1:01:34] to bring in all the virgins
[1:01:38] so they went out and they found all the
[1:01:39] virgins but they found one that was a
[1:01:41] gentile bride
[1:01:53] the marriage of the Lamb it says and
[1:01:55] that we know that there is going to be a
[1:01:57] bride and there's going to be a wedding
[1:01:58] supper served in the skies
[1:02:00] that's just as to be that's just as sure
[1:02:03] to be as God is because it's his word
[1:02:06] and we know that those that are going to
[1:02:09] make up the bride is going to be his
[1:02:11] church
[1:02:12] and they're going to appear before him
[1:02:14] without spot or wrinkle
[1:02:16] and they have the material in Earth now
[1:02:18] to make themselves ready
[1:02:21] it's not a future tense
[1:02:23] it's not a past tense
[1:02:25] it's not some way way out there
[1:02:28] but now
[1:02:30] she has the material
[1:02:32] what is the material
[1:02:34] it's the word of God
[1:02:35] Through the Bible and through the
[1:02:37] message of the hour
[1:02:40] you have everything you need
[1:02:43] in those 1100 and some 1200 whatever it
[1:02:46] is messages
[1:02:48] everything you need to be materialized
[1:02:51] as the bride
[1:02:52] to step forth and take your place
[1:02:54] and shine
[1:02:56] the rise shine For Your Glory has come
[1:03:00] that was the title this message
[1:03:03] let's go to
[1:03:05] Esther chapter 4.
[1:03:08] 14.
[1:03:13] the title that I had was bride
[1:03:21] you are made for this time
[1:03:25] bride you are made for this time
[1:03:29] in 4 14 it says
[1:03:32] let's go to verse 12 and
[1:03:35] so Mordecai was I'll give you some
[1:03:37] background so Mordecai
[1:03:39] was told that there was a law gonna
[1:03:41] coming out that's going to put all the
[1:03:43] Jews death and all that and
[1:03:45] so he's going to Esther who's now the
[1:03:47] queen
[1:03:50] and
[1:03:52] and Mordecai commanded to answer to
[1:03:55] Esther think not with thyself that thou
[1:03:58] will shalt Escape in the King's house
[1:04:00] more than all the Jews for thou
[1:04:03] altogether Hold Us thy peace at this
[1:04:05] time then shall the enlargement
[1:04:07] then shall their enlargement and
[1:04:08] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[1:04:10] another place
[1:04:11] but thou and thy fathers thou shall be
[1:04:13] destroyed and who kneareth whether Thou
[1:04:15] Art come for to the kingdom for such a
[1:04:18] time as this right I say it's no longer
[1:04:21] a question who knows whether you might
[1:04:24] be it's not a question it might be it's
[1:04:26] not a question of maybe so but you have
[1:04:29] come to this time this is the end time
[1:04:32] we are looking at end time days we're
[1:04:35] looking at Russia's trembling we're
[1:04:37] looking at the United States to trim
[1:04:38] we're looking at all the nations they're
[1:04:40] trembling they don't know what's going
[1:04:41] on we're looking at economic downturns
[1:04:44] we're looking at at uh everything that's
[1:04:47] saying you throw into this world is more
[1:04:49] immortality and all that has come upon
[1:04:51] the Earth it is Blackness it is Darkness
[1:04:55] that's where we're at today
[1:04:58] but before this day is over there has to
[1:05:00] be a light that shines
[1:05:02] and who is that light it is the bride of
[1:05:04] Christ
[1:05:05] she will step forth and Shine the beauty
[1:05:09] of the king she will step forth in the
[1:05:11] power of the king
[1:05:13] and if you remember when we went we'll
[1:05:16] go back to chapter two here
[1:05:18] and we're just going to go through this
[1:05:20] part quickly here
[1:05:22] so they sent out the decree for all the
[1:05:24] all the virgins to come forth and here
[1:05:26] they are
[1:05:27] and and so it came to pass with the
[1:05:29] king's commandment and his decree Was
[1:05:32] Heard and when many maidens were
[1:05:33] gathered together into shushan the
[1:05:35] palace to the custody of haggai that has
[1:05:38] that Esther was brought also into the
[1:05:41] King's house to the custody of haggai
[1:05:43] the keeper
[1:05:45] now who was Esther in marriage of the
[1:05:47] lamb in 62 it says it pleased the king
[1:05:49] it's uh
[1:05:51] paragraph 156 it please the king so he
[1:05:54] sent and he sent out the chamber maids
[1:05:55] and so forth that went out to pick all
[1:05:58] the young virgins that he could that
[1:06:00] could the beautiful women throughout all
[1:06:01] the kingdoms and the provinces that he
[1:06:04] was over which was the greatest in the
[1:06:06] world
[1:06:08] who's what's the greatest Kingdom in the
[1:06:09] world right now it's God
[1:06:12] God's Canaan the kingdom of God the
[1:06:15] greatest Kingdom of all the world this
[1:06:17] is perfect types
[1:06:19] and when he did it came to this little
[1:06:22] Jewish girl
[1:06:24] and she was rather kind of an off cast
[1:06:26] because like the Gentiles are seeing she
[1:06:29] was cast off to one side and she had no
[1:06:31] father and mother and Mordecai her uncle
[1:06:33] was Raising her and she had to go to
[1:06:35] qualify
[1:06:38] so when the Jews rejected Christ
[1:06:41] when they rejected the Son of God the
[1:06:43] Gentiles had to go to qualify
[1:06:46] and it was malting virgins that came
[1:06:48] forth to qualified
[1:06:54] and then so Esther was brought also into
[1:06:57] the King's house to the custody of
[1:06:59] haggai Keeper of the women
[1:07:01] and the Maiden pleased him and she
[1:07:03] attained kindness of him and brother
[1:07:05] Brandon's message
[1:07:08] remember the first pull in the second
[1:07:09] poll were to the denominations
[1:07:12] they were the signs and wonders all that
[1:07:14] but when it came to the third pool
[1:07:16] only one caught his favor
[1:07:18] only one caught his eyes only one found
[1:07:21] favor in the in the prophet's message
[1:07:24] and that was the bride of Christ
[1:07:26] the true bride
[1:07:30] so
[1:07:32] the bride found excellent favor more
[1:07:34] favor
[1:07:35] than the rest of the virgins
[1:07:39] and the Maiden Police them she attained
[1:07:41] kindness of him
[1:07:42] and he speedily gave her things for her
[1:07:45] purification with such things as
[1:07:47] belonged to her
[1:07:50] and seven maidens seven Church ages
[1:07:54] the churches and females
[1:07:56] he gave her seven Church ages
[1:07:59] to reveal the mysteries of God
[1:08:01] throughout all the ages
[1:08:04] he couldn't just give her one Maiden
[1:08:06] because she can't just live on the first
[1:08:07] church age
[1:08:09] she couldn't give give her three because
[1:08:11] she couldn't live in three but she had
[1:08:12] to have all seven to take a rapture
[1:08:15] to take a body change she has to have
[1:08:18] all seven Church ages
[1:08:20] in order to step into the Fulfillment
[1:08:22] and the completeness of Christ's bride
[1:08:26] there were different parts of the Bride
[1:08:28] came out through all those ages but in
[1:08:30] the end time they all culminated they
[1:08:33] create one multi-member body
[1:08:40] he gave into her seven maidens which
[1:08:42] were meat to be given to her out of the
[1:08:44] King's house and they preferred her and
[1:08:46] her maidens are to the best place of the
[1:08:48] House of the women
[1:08:51] and Esther had not showed her
[1:08:53] her people nor Kindred for Mordecai and
[1:08:55] charged her that she should not show it
[1:08:56] and Mordecai walked every day before the
[1:08:59] court of the women's house to know how
[1:09:00] Esther did and what should become of her
[1:09:03] now when every maiden's turn was come to
[1:09:05] go into the king of hasawaris or Xerxes
[1:09:09] after that she had been 12 months
[1:09:11] according to the manner of women where
[1:09:13] so the days of her purification
[1:09:15] were accomplished in what six months of
[1:09:17] more oil myrrh and six months sweet
[1:09:19] odors and other things of the purifying
[1:09:21] of the women and thus came every Maiden
[1:09:23] unto the king whatsoever she desired was
[1:09:25] given her to go with her out of the
[1:09:27] house of the women and to the King's
[1:09:29] house
[1:09:30] so when these versions were brought to
[1:09:31] go call to go forth
[1:09:34] they were given free moral agency
[1:09:37] they were given a choice to go in with
[1:09:39] what the king provided by his messenger
[1:09:43] or they she was given
[1:09:45] the choice to add to it or take away
[1:09:48] from it
[1:09:50] the denominations
[1:09:52] and even the denominations within the
[1:09:54] message are given the exact same choice
[1:09:58] to take away or give
[1:10:01] it's up to her
[1:10:03] and you know like the denominations they
[1:10:04] they love the signs and water wonders
[1:10:06] but some of them didn't think they were
[1:10:08] good enough that they needed to add
[1:10:11] Beauty to them
[1:10:12] they needed to add great buildings they
[1:10:14] needed that great the great programs and
[1:10:17] they said this word of God off to the
[1:10:19] side and they focus so much on the
[1:10:21] outward Beauty
[1:10:22] instead of the inward Beauty
[1:10:25] that when they were presented before the
[1:10:27] king he sent her off to the concubine
[1:10:29] home of the concubines
[1:10:32] and even in the message they were
[1:10:34] presented with the full word
[1:10:36] but they're not going on forth with the
[1:10:38] word
[1:10:40] they stopped when the messenger passed
[1:10:42] away
[1:10:43] and they denominated around him
[1:10:45] and they've denominated around all we
[1:10:48] need is the tapes
[1:10:49] there's nothing new to come forth
[1:10:52] though brother Branham would stand there
[1:10:54] and tell them take everything I said
[1:10:56] back to the word of God
[1:10:59] take it back
[1:11:01] and he would also tell
[1:11:03] him when he was asked the one time
[1:11:06] are you the only one to preach well
[1:11:08] whoever told you that
[1:11:10] whoever gave you that idea
[1:11:12] where did that come from
[1:11:17] they stopped right there
[1:11:20] they look at
[1:11:23] try not to be a reverend I'm not putting
[1:11:26] the profit down I'm walking on eggshells
[1:11:29] I feel like right now
[1:11:33] because it's a new territory for me
[1:11:37] they
[1:11:40] they look to a dead man as their pastor
[1:11:45] who can't be in the hospital rooms like
[1:11:47] I was like my pastor came up
[1:11:51] who can't sit there and give counseling
[1:11:55] to a wife whose husband's leaving the
[1:11:57] message or to a husband whose wife is
[1:11:59] questioning the message or to a teenager
[1:12:01] who's questioning the message or to a
[1:12:03] teenager that's looking for a life
[1:12:04] that's present tense living
[1:12:07] instead they are looking at people that
[1:12:09] are well listen to this this day and
[1:12:12] they're they're instead of having
[1:12:15] inspiration not saying that God can't if
[1:12:18] you're in a situation where
[1:12:19] you're not even close to a church and
[1:12:21] there's no way
[1:12:23] for you to be close to the church or
[1:12:24] anything like that and you've got some
[1:12:26] messages he can inspire you to choose
[1:12:28] the right message and all that
[1:12:31] but when you are denominated around just
[1:12:34] choosing a tape and all that
[1:12:36] there is very little chance for
[1:12:39] inspiration there
[1:12:41] a fresh kill inspiration
[1:12:44] whereas I've been in behind the pulpit
[1:12:46] and called something out before
[1:12:49] right in the middle of it
[1:12:50] then in the Pulpit but somebody was
[1:12:52] struggling something I said something
[1:12:54] they come up to me afterwards and say
[1:12:56] I was struggling with that and I go that
[1:12:58] was not in my notes
[1:13:00] I had no intentions of saying that how
[1:13:02] many times you heard a minister
[1:13:03] preaching
[1:13:05] and all of a sudden they start going off
[1:13:07] on a little Rabbit Trail
[1:13:09] you ever think that that little Rabbit
[1:13:10] Trail is because somebody's got a
[1:13:12] question
[1:13:13] because somebody out there has got a you
[1:13:14] got a a thought or a wrong way or
[1:13:17] something like that
[1:13:21] so when when these virgins came up they
[1:13:24] looked at themselves and some of them
[1:13:25] say oh I'm not good enough I'm not good
[1:13:27] enough I'm not good enough
[1:13:29] instead of looking well the king gave me
[1:13:32] what it takes to make me good enough
[1:13:34] and all I have to do is step into what
[1:13:37] his messenger told me all I have to do
[1:13:40] is take on
[1:13:41] Revelations 10 7. all I have to do is
[1:13:44] accept Malachi 4 5 and 6. all I have to
[1:13:46] do is look at the message and it told me
[1:13:48] I needed to be baptized in the name of
[1:13:50] the Lord Jesus Christ if I look into the
[1:13:52] message it tells me that there's one God
[1:13:53] and
[1:13:55] and so forth and so on and all the
[1:13:57] Mysteries that he gave us
[1:14:01] instead of doing that they start looking
[1:14:03] at themselves or they start or they or
[1:14:05] they look back at the First Church
[1:14:07] Catholic the Catholic church and the
[1:14:10] beauty and glamor and all that and they
[1:14:12] start well we'll start patterning after
[1:14:14] Mother Harley
[1:14:17] we'll start patterning we'll paint our
[1:14:19] face up just a little bit like hers and
[1:14:21] and we'll we'll build big towers over
[1:14:24] here and and we'll we'll have these big
[1:14:26] programs over here and and they get so
[1:14:29] far away from the actual word of God
[1:14:31] that they refuse
[1:14:34] the beauty of Christ
[1:14:35] and they've turned down bright ship
[1:14:47] so you see they had
[1:14:49] free moral agency
[1:14:52] and then this came every Maiden unto the
[1:14:54] king whatever she desired was given her
[1:14:56] to go with her out of the house of the
[1:14:58] women unto the King's house
[1:15:00] and in the evening she she went and on
[1:15:03] tomorrow she returned to the second
[1:15:04] house of the women to the custody of the
[1:15:07] shahz guys the king's Chamberlain which
[1:15:10] kept the concubines she came in unto the
[1:15:13] king no more
[1:15:16] except for the king delighted in her and
[1:15:18] that she were called by name
[1:15:21] there's many times that he uses the
[1:15:23] nomination there will be many times that
[1:15:25] he'll use a tape Ministry there have
[1:15:27] been many times that it will use
[1:15:28] different ones that that have even
[1:15:31] backslidden
[1:15:33] to bring somebody that's about to
[1:15:35] backslide or somebody has already
[1:15:37] backslot and whether they come back or
[1:15:38] not but bring them forth and bring them
[1:15:41] into the presence of God again
[1:15:49] so she wasn't
[1:15:50] of no use anymore
[1:15:53] I would say the denominations are of no
[1:15:55] use anymore God still accomplishes great
[1:15:58] humanitarian Works through them God
[1:16:01] still accomplishes bringing stray bride
[1:16:04] in from there
[1:16:06] so God still uses them it's like that
[1:16:09] illustration I said Wednesday you have a
[1:16:11] pocket full of change you have some
[1:16:12] pennies you have some quarters you have
[1:16:14] some nickels you have some dimes then
[1:16:15] you have a silver dollar
[1:16:17] well the silver dollar is the full
[1:16:19] package
[1:16:21] the others still have value
[1:16:25] and you can even say it this way
[1:16:27] and even in the bride itself maybe you
[1:16:31] consider yourself a penny
[1:16:33] and you're just a widow woman that sits
[1:16:36] in there and you pray for somebody
[1:16:39] and you look at the pastor as The Silver
[1:16:41] Dollar
[1:16:42] and in between you see all the different
[1:16:44] gifts and you say deacons and all that
[1:16:47] you know what
[1:16:48] you're still part of that silver dollar
[1:16:51] it still takes you to make up that
[1:16:53] silver dollar
[1:16:54] it still takes your gift in the body
[1:16:56] whether you're a penny whether you're a
[1:16:58] half a cent whether you're dented
[1:17:00] whether you're scratched whatever it is
[1:17:01] whether you're a piece of corner off a
[1:17:03] dollar bill it still takes you to make
[1:17:05] that hole
[1:17:09] so you have value no matter what your
[1:17:12] position is in the church if you're
[1:17:13] looking at something oh I wish I could
[1:17:15] sing like that and I wish I could do
[1:17:16] this get that nonsense out of your mind
[1:17:18] you were called to sing like that you be
[1:17:21] you you stay in your position they'll
[1:17:23] stay in their position and we'll make up
[1:17:25] that full dollar that silver dollar
[1:17:28] and will shine as a church will shine as
[1:17:31] a body and we'll step forward and we'll
[1:17:33] be that bride that will shine in this
[1:17:36] last stage stop looking at one another
[1:17:38] stop getting your eyes off of Christ
[1:17:41] and look at Christ full-fast
[1:17:44] look in his glory
[1:17:46] don't consider yourself don't consider
[1:17:48] your position
[1:17:50] maybe all you do is sit in the church
[1:17:52] pew but you sing
[1:17:54] you pull on the word of God
[1:17:57] you don't have a Ministry per se
[1:18:01] all of us have a Ministry
[1:18:05] all of us have to be where we are in the
[1:18:08] body of Christ
[1:18:10] I can't be Dale langstaff as a pastor
[1:18:16] I can't be Jared it's only here
[1:18:20] that's not me
[1:18:22] I can't be the singer that my wife is
[1:18:27] and she'll testify to that
[1:18:30] I can't be Luanne Carpenter
[1:18:35] I can't be Felix salad
[1:18:39] it's not my calling
[1:18:43] my calling is to be Mike Allen
[1:18:47] believer in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:50] and to go forth wherever he should call
[1:18:52] me
[1:18:54] whether it be to Wyoming to harvest
[1:18:57] bright Tabernacle
[1:18:59] or whether it be
[1:19:01] to
[1:19:02] little Bethlehem down in Hamilton Ohio
[1:19:05] the Church of about 10 15 20.
[1:19:09] or B to some great big African
[1:19:13] congregation someday
[1:19:15] we still
[1:19:17] we'll get there one day
[1:19:21] but
[1:19:22] I can't pastor this church because it's
[1:19:25] not my call
[1:19:27] and furthermore
[1:19:28] nothing against you it's not in my heart
[1:19:30] to be your pastor
[1:19:33] it's just just examples and it's not my
[1:19:35] heart to be the pastor of true or
[1:19:36] Tabernacle where I sit under a wonderful
[1:19:38] pastor
[1:19:41] because it's not where the Lord's kept
[1:19:43] me
[1:19:46] and it's not my
[1:19:48] desire to be a great singer either well
[1:19:50] I would like to be a great singer but
[1:19:53] not necessarily a song later
[1:20:01] so here we have
[1:20:03] now when it now when the turn of Esther
[1:20:06] the daughter of Abigail and I'm sorry
[1:20:08] for all you that were here Wednesday I'm
[1:20:10] repeating a lot but
[1:20:13] but I know brother Dale's enjoyed it so
[1:20:15] much that the Lord dissoluted on my
[1:20:17] heart that I I do have more to go into
[1:20:21] but I'm bringing everybody else to speed
[1:20:22] but more is coming out than I didn't say
[1:20:25] Wednesday either so
[1:20:27] praise the Lord
[1:20:29] now with the turn investor the daughter
[1:20:30] of Abigail the uncle of Mordecai who had
[1:20:33] taken her for his daughter was come to
[1:20:35] go into the king she required nothing
[1:20:38] but wahagai well her seventh age
[1:20:41] messenger what our Prophet gave us she
[1:20:45] required nothing
[1:20:47] but what the king's Chamberlain
[1:20:50] The Keeper of the woman appointed
[1:20:55] we don't have to have an eighth day
[1:20:57] messenger
[1:20:59] we're not looking for another Prophet to
[1:21:01] come on the scene to fulfill what the
[1:21:03] prophet's already fulfilled
[1:21:05] to finish this work we're not we're not
[1:21:08] waiting for a return Ministry of the
[1:21:10] Prophet the return Ministry is the bride
[1:21:12] of Christ if you want to say there's a
[1:21:14] return Ministry the ministry is carrying
[1:21:17] on through the bride of Christ it has
[1:21:19] now stepped into her and now it's her
[1:21:21] turn to shine it's her turn to bring
[1:21:24] forth the word to the world let's go
[1:21:26] over to Revelations chapter 10 verse 8.
[1:21:29] and it's beautiful over here
[1:21:31] yeah
[1:21:32] I mean it's just beautiful you know in
[1:21:35] chapter 10 verse 7
[1:21:37] that's our Messenger right there but in
[1:21:39] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:21:40] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:21:42] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:21:44] hath declared unto his servants and
[1:21:46] Prophets that's our messenger's message
[1:21:48] right there 10-7 but you know what at 10
[1:21:51] 8 it goes on and it leaves the messenger
[1:21:55] and it's all of a sudden it's addressed
[1:21:57] to John and who is John the type of
[1:21:59] John's the type of the Bride she he is
[1:22:02] the bride's type and it goes on and it
[1:22:05] says in the voice which I heard from
[1:22:06] Heaven spake unto me and said go and
[1:22:09] take
[1:22:10] the little book that is opened in the
[1:22:12] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[1:22:14] the sea and upon the Earth go and take
[1:22:16] the message of the hour go and take the
[1:22:18] word of God go and take your Bible go
[1:22:20] and take this message at the seventh
[1:22:22] angel in verse 7 brought and you eat it
[1:22:24] and you become one with it yes it's
[1:22:26] going to be bitter in your belly because
[1:22:27] it's going to create change in your life
[1:22:29] it's going to make you stand out to all
[1:22:31] those that around you and it's going to
[1:22:33] create some hard times and it's going to
[1:22:34] create some some times that are going to
[1:22:36] be questionable and you're going to be
[1:22:37] ridiculed you're going to be made fun of
[1:22:39] because you're falling after a 17
[1:22:41] messenger and you're walking into his
[1:22:43] glory and all that and you know what
[1:22:49] you've got to take it you've got to eat
[1:22:51] it you've got to partake of it you have
[1:22:54] to
[1:22:56] be the one that takes a hold of it
[1:23:00] John had no choice here and if John's
[1:23:03] the bride we have no choice if we don't
[1:23:06] take the full message of the hour and
[1:23:08] take it and become one of it one with it
[1:23:10] then God has no part of us it's just
[1:23:13] like communion that we're going to do
[1:23:15] tonight if we don't partake of communion
[1:23:17] he said who you have no pardon me if you
[1:23:20] don't partake of foot washing you have
[1:23:22] no part in me
[1:23:24] this is communion right here this is you
[1:23:27] right here this is what you were to
[1:23:29] become this is what you are to be you
[1:23:32] step into it
[1:23:35] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:23:37] spoken to me again and said go and take
[1:23:39] the little book which is open in the
[1:23:41] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[1:23:42] the sea and upon the Earth and I went
[1:23:44] unto the angel and I said unto him
[1:23:46] give me the little book give me the
[1:23:49] message of the hour give me the tapes
[1:23:51] give me the books give me the bible let
[1:23:54] me devour it let me take it in I don't
[1:23:56] care anymore
[1:23:58] I want to be one with Christ I want to
[1:24:01] be just like him I want him and me
[1:24:03] dwelling in me living through me
[1:24:07] and if I don't eat him
[1:24:10] how can he do it
[1:24:14] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:24:16] them give me that little book and he
[1:24:17] said unto me take and eat it up and it
[1:24:19] shall make thy belly bitter and it shall
[1:24:21] be in the mouth sweet as honey and I
[1:24:23] took that little book out of the Angel's
[1:24:25] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[1:24:27] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[1:24:29] had eaten it and my belly was bitter
[1:24:31] well it created a change in him
[1:24:34] oh it was wonderful you remember when
[1:24:36] you first came to the message of the
[1:24:37] hour when you first got your Revelation
[1:24:39] oh it was beautiful and all that you
[1:24:42] thought the whole world knew about it
[1:24:43] and you all that and all of a sudden you
[1:24:44] found out you're just this little
[1:24:45] computer peculiar bird this little
[1:24:48] no-name this little saying that people
[1:24:50] make fun of you're you're nothing and if
[1:24:53] you really follow the truth in the
[1:24:54] message then you really become nothing
[1:24:57] if you follow the word as it's stated by
[1:24:59] the prophet and you don't denominate
[1:25:01] around the message and you don't take
[1:25:02] just the gifts and the healings and you
[1:25:04] don't take just the profit and
[1:25:06] denominate around a belt buckle and all
[1:25:09] that and the cowboy hat and say you're
[1:25:10] saved and all that but you step into the
[1:25:12] message fully you'll be made fun of even
[1:25:15] by message believers
[1:25:17] you'll be ridiculed even by message
[1:25:19] believers and that that's that's a
[1:25:21] better thing to take but you know what
[1:25:23] we're going to take it if you're the
[1:25:25] true bride you're going to take it
[1:25:26] you're going to step into it you're
[1:25:28] going on with it and you will love it
[1:25:31] there was a sweet side to it too there
[1:25:33] was a side that would give you rejoicing
[1:25:35] in your soul there was a giant sight
[1:25:37] that would give you Revival in your soul
[1:25:39] there was a side of the word that would
[1:25:40] give you all that and it would overcome
[1:25:42] that bitterness so that you would eat it
[1:25:50] and he said unto me
[1:25:55] this is the brain it's Commission
[1:25:58] this wasn't to brother Branham
[1:26:01] brother Branham was done in verse 7.
[1:26:04] brother random went off the scene in
[1:26:06] verse 7.
[1:26:08] because there was a revive a bright age
[1:26:10] to come there was an age that the bride
[1:26:13] had to step into to become the
[1:26:14] Fulfillment of the message of the hour
[1:26:16] to become one with him to become the one
[1:26:19] that he would put on display remember
[1:26:20] what I said Wednesday that that in the
[1:26:23] marriage no
[1:26:25] the groom's already standing at the
[1:26:28] front and he's in plain view
[1:26:30] and all sudden
[1:26:32] the music comes on everybody rides and
[1:26:36] they turn and they look back and there
[1:26:39] is his Beauty
[1:26:41] there's the secret that would have been
[1:26:43] hidden from all the ages there's his
[1:26:46] bride coming walking down the aisle
[1:26:49] coming in plain view
[1:26:51] coming that so she would shine to this
[1:26:54] world that she would be his
[1:26:55] representative
[1:26:57] that that she would be his completeness
[1:27:00] his fullness
[1:27:03] and he says and this is the bride
[1:27:06] and he said unto me
[1:27:08] thou must prophesy again
[1:27:12] before many peoples Nations tongues and
[1:27:15] Kings what's the bride to do to take the
[1:27:17] word and live it
[1:27:20] this isn't going out and saying
[1:27:23] I prophesy there's a tornado going to
[1:27:25] come into town it's going to take out
[1:27:26] this house of the times you guys be out
[1:27:27] of town or I prophesy you're going to
[1:27:29] get cancer and this and this and this
[1:27:30] and you do this and oh
[1:27:33] prophesy the word the Lord is coming the
[1:27:36] end is at nigh nigh it in your life on
[1:27:40] display you living the word walking
[1:27:43] talking living and Holiness and in
[1:27:47] righteousness taking on what does it say
[1:27:54] I wrote that down here
[1:27:56] in Galatians chapter 5 22
[1:27:58] through 24 it says
[1:28:00] and this is I just kind of wrote this
[1:28:02] down here but you can go check it if you
[1:28:05] want if you don't believe me but the
[1:28:07] fruit of the spirit is love joy peace
[1:28:10] long-suffering this world doesn't have
[1:28:12] any long suffering anymore you cross me
[1:28:14] I'm going to kill you is what it is
[1:28:16] today you cross me I'm going to hit your
[1:28:18] head with a hammer or I'm going to get
[1:28:20] my gun out and I'm going to shoot you
[1:28:21] you come and you get in front of me you
[1:28:23] drive slow on the road and all that
[1:28:25] there is no long suffering today
[1:28:29] there's no love in this world today
[1:28:30] there's it's there's a there's a false
[1:28:33] love there's a mirage love you know they
[1:28:35] that's saying love is love that's a
[1:28:38] false love
[1:28:40] love is corrective if they really had
[1:28:42] loved they would go out and they would
[1:28:43] show them the word of God and say the
[1:28:45] lifestyle that you are living the way
[1:28:47] that you're living is a falsity and
[1:28:49] you're going to go to hell if you don't
[1:28:51] change and if you don't repent and back
[1:28:53] up love is love is not love it's a it's
[1:28:57] a mirage it's an illusion it's to help
[1:29:00] you it's the the
[1:29:02] satisfy your psyche to make you feel
[1:29:04] good to make you feel like you're some
[1:29:06] kind of a warrior or something like that
[1:29:08] because I got my love as love sign out
[1:29:10] there and I'm going to accept everything
[1:29:11] and everything but love is corrective
[1:29:14] why do we correct our children we don't
[1:29:16] want them to become
[1:29:18] bombs and all that
[1:29:20] we want them to respect authority we
[1:29:22] don't want to hear about them telling
[1:29:24] the police off or whatever and being
[1:29:26] shot and killed like they're doing the
[1:29:28] states these days
[1:29:32] we want to learn respect for the word of
[1:29:34] God we want to learn to sit still in
[1:29:37] church because it says be still and know
[1:29:39] that I am God
[1:29:45] that is absent from the world today it
[1:29:47] is my rights it's laodicea but the
[1:29:50] brides come out of laodice he and she's
[1:29:52] living in the bright age she's living in
[1:29:54] an age that the Satan can't touch she's
[1:29:56] living in a world that Satan can't touch
[1:29:57] he tries to touch her through the flesh
[1:29:59] he tries to touch her through mind
[1:30:01] battles he tries to get her down and all
[1:30:03] that but he cannot touch that Soul
[1:30:05] because she's already been raptured
[1:30:07] spiritually
[1:30:09] all we're waiting on is the natural
[1:30:12] change of the body
[1:30:14] but spiritually we're already resting
[1:30:17] spiritual era in Heavenly places
[1:30:19] spiritually earlier with Christ
[1:30:25] but the fruit of the spirit is love and
[1:30:27] joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[1:30:29] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:30:31] against such there is no all and they
[1:30:33] that are Christ have crucified the flesh
[1:30:35] with the affections and the lusts
[1:30:38] oh if you're still walking around baby
[1:30:40] in some kind of secret sin
[1:30:43] you're not you haven't fulfilled the law
[1:30:47] no Christ came to fulfill the law
[1:30:50] so that it could not touch us
[1:30:55] but when Christ lives in US
[1:30:59] we fulfill the law
[1:31:01] by living the works
[1:31:03] not that we're Saved By The Works
[1:31:06] but all of a sudden it becomes a desire
[1:31:09] it becomes a want
[1:31:10] it becomes I have to
[1:31:13] not because I'm afraid I'll go to hell
[1:31:15] because that was already settled from
[1:31:16] before the foundation of the world
[1:31:19] but I want to be pleasing I want to be
[1:31:21] that testimony I want to be I want to
[1:31:24] walk in full fellowship with the Lord I
[1:31:25] mean we can walk and have fellowship if
[1:31:27] we want to and still be saved
[1:31:31] but a true Christian has got the bad to
[1:31:33] the Holy Spirit once full fellowship and
[1:31:37] has to have full Fellowship the bride
[1:31:40] will have to have full Fellowship she
[1:31:42] has to walk in his glory she has to walk
[1:31:45] in his humbleness she has to walk in his
[1:31:48] strength
[1:31:50] and it won't be us doing the law and
[1:31:53] living it through us
[1:31:54] yes the flesh gets tempted As Romans
[1:31:57] chapter 7 the things that I would I do
[1:31:59] not the things that I do I would not and
[1:32:02] so forth and so on and he said I see two
[1:32:04] walls working in my flesh
[1:32:06] you know all the spirit and of all the
[1:32:08] soul
[1:32:09] they're always fighting which one are
[1:32:11] you feeding the most it's like that
[1:32:12] Indian guy he'd come up
[1:32:15] to that Indian Brotherhood given his
[1:32:17] heart to the Lord and he said how's it
[1:32:18] been since you started serving the lord
[1:32:19] and he said he says like two dogs inside
[1:32:22] fight
[1:32:23] one's white and one's black
[1:32:25] and he said well which one wins he goes
[1:32:27] whichever one I feed the most
[1:32:31] you ever get down and you ever get
[1:32:33] despaired and all that and and you
[1:32:35] notice
[1:32:37] you start feeding on easy things
[1:32:40] you might start watching more videos
[1:32:41] than you ever watched and you might
[1:32:43] start to watch start watching I'm just
[1:32:45] going to be real with you
[1:32:47] we're all the same
[1:32:49] we all have like passions and like
[1:32:51] desires and all that
[1:32:53] we might open up Facebook and spend
[1:32:55] hours and hours there
[1:32:57] we might open up
[1:32:58] YouTube and watch how-to videos for five
[1:33:02] hours long and not learn a single thing
[1:33:04] because
[1:33:06] it's easier than confronting our fears
[1:33:09] by the word of the lord it's easier than
[1:33:11] confronting our faults through the word
[1:33:13] of the lord it's easier because Satan's
[1:33:15] always there to tell you that you're no
[1:33:17] good he's always there to tell you that
[1:33:19] you won't amount to anything he's always
[1:33:21] there to tell you that you might as well
[1:33:22] give up you're lost in all that
[1:33:25] and we get down and we get in these pity
[1:33:27] parties and we start focusing more on
[1:33:29] natural things we started focusing more
[1:33:31] on the world than we do
[1:33:33] walking in the word
[1:33:43] so you must prophesy again and
[1:33:48] we see Esther here
[1:33:50] she required nothing
[1:33:53] but what the seventh messenger given she
[1:33:57] required nothing but the Lord
[1:34:00] had given her
[1:34:09] where is that
[1:34:13] in marriage of the lamb in 62 and verse
[1:34:26] to refuse the worldly adornment she took
[1:34:29] the spirit in her heart to go before the
[1:34:31] king
[1:34:32] he took the word into our heart together
[1:34:34] before the king she took the word of the
[1:34:36] messenger in her heart
[1:34:38] to go before the king
[1:34:40] remember when she went before the king
[1:34:43] she went by herself
[1:34:45] when she went into the bridechamber the
[1:34:47] groom chamber the bridal chamber to
[1:34:49] consummate the marriage
[1:34:51] Peggy I didn't go in there with her
[1:34:55] Eliezer didn't go in
[1:35:01] that's God and his bride
[1:35:08] it was Isaac and Rebecca
[1:35:11] it was Esther and xers
[1:35:15] it is us and Christ
[1:35:20] our Prophet give us everything we need
[1:35:24] and the Lord had to take him off the
[1:35:26] scene
[1:35:28] so that the word message could be
[1:35:31] manifest through us
[1:35:33] and so that all he had to do is come
[1:35:36] tell us what God liked
[1:35:39] show us the Mysteries restores back to
[1:35:41] an Apostolic age
[1:35:43] and all that
[1:35:44] and tell us how to approach
[1:35:48] our King
[1:35:49] so that we would be accepted
[1:35:52] he introduced us to the groom
[1:35:57] then he steps back
[1:36:12] and it becomes a personal
[1:36:14] Revelation here
[1:36:16] and you think about the Rings
[1:36:18] the groom The Man Hands Up The Prophet
[1:36:22] hands off the marriage ring to the the
[1:36:26] groom and said here's your bride give
[1:36:28] her
[1:36:29] I present you your bride brother Branham
[1:36:33] said dear Lord I present you your bride
[1:36:35] I've done everything that I can now
[1:36:37] here's the Final Act I'm stepping back
[1:36:41] now it's eternity with YouTube
[1:36:43] the symbol of the Ring
[1:36:45] eternity
[1:36:46] insanity and there's never an end never
[1:36:48] a beginning
[1:36:50] gold deity the two of them become a
[1:36:53] deity
[1:37:00] then we go over here in chapter four
[1:37:05] and he says
[1:37:08] whether Thou Art comes with the kingdom
[1:37:09] for a Time
[1:37:11] as this then Esther made them
[1:37:14] turned Mordecai this answer go and
[1:37:17] gather all together the Jews that are
[1:37:19] present in shushan and fast for me and
[1:37:22] neither eaten or drink these three days
[1:37:23] or night or that I may also
[1:37:26] I also my maidens will Fast likewise and
[1:37:30] so will I go into the King which is not
[1:37:32] according to the law and if I perish I
[1:37:35] perish
[1:37:37] so here she comes she's
[1:37:39] she finally she she argued with Mordecai
[1:37:41] to start with I I can't she didn't
[1:37:43] realize who she was
[1:37:45] you realize she had already went into
[1:37:47] the
[1:37:48] and consummated the marriage she had
[1:37:51] already become the Bride of Xerxes she
[1:37:53] had already become favored in cersei's
[1:37:55] eyes she was already loved by xers we're
[1:37:58] already loved by Christ we're already
[1:38:00] favored in his eyes but we forget who we
[1:38:03] are and when Trials come our way what
[1:38:06] testings come our way we forget who we
[1:38:08] are and we're afraid to go and approach
[1:38:10] our husband and ask him for help
[1:38:13] and here Esther's coming and Mordecai
[1:38:16] and there's bad news haman's out they're
[1:38:17] going to kill all the Jews there's been
[1:38:19] a decree go forth against all the Jews
[1:38:22] there was a decree that went forth when
[1:38:24] Eve fell that everybody would die in
[1:38:27] their sin that the law the law was
[1:38:30] written already
[1:38:33] when Eve sinned law was written against
[1:38:36] all mankind that she would die
[1:38:43] and here she's afraid but but then she
[1:38:45] finally remembers
[1:38:47] her prophet's message
[1:38:50] she remembered how she was to prepare
[1:38:52] herself to go in the first time
[1:38:55] we remember Howard to prepare ourselves
[1:38:57] to go inside and the first time into our
[1:38:59] King we humble ourselves we make
[1:39:02] ourselves ready we get in the word we
[1:39:03] prepare our hearts how do we do it we
[1:39:05] come to church we we're getting the
[1:39:07] message in the hour and we're coming to
[1:39:08] church we have a need and we know we're
[1:39:10] going to get and we know if we come
[1:39:12] prepared to church we'll get Deliverance
[1:39:15] of some way or if we have something else
[1:39:18] and and we need to call somebody we
[1:39:20] prepare our we put down the Flesh and we
[1:39:22] start getting all antsy and all that and
[1:39:24] we start focusing on the word and say
[1:39:26] the answer is in the word maybe cancer
[1:39:28] is trying to kill you maybe somebody's
[1:39:30] trying to persecute you maybe some kind
[1:39:32] of Trials come in and they're taking
[1:39:34] loved ones or whatever but all of a
[1:39:35] sudden you stop you stop worrying about
[1:39:37] that and you start focusing on the word
[1:39:39] you start humbling yourself before God
[1:39:41] then he can come on the scene for you
[1:39:43] and here she is she comes and she she
[1:39:46] gathers everybody together and they pray
[1:39:48] and they fast and and they start reading
[1:39:51] the word and she starts to remember that
[1:39:52] what her messenger said she starts
[1:39:54] remembering the way that she said he
[1:39:56] said to her approach her and what kind
[1:39:58] of Garb do where the Robes of his
[1:40:00] righteousness the robes that he provided
[1:40:02] so many times we want to go there in the
[1:40:03] Robes of our own righteousness Lord I
[1:40:05] look what I did I did this yesterday and
[1:40:07] I helped feed this person over here and
[1:40:09] I helped this person over here and I did
[1:40:11] this and I didn't send over here and I
[1:40:13] remember I was going to say that cuss
[1:40:14] word and I didn't say that customer
[1:40:15] remember I was going to look at that
[1:40:17] pornography but I didn't look at that
[1:40:18] point wrong and we start looking at our
[1:40:20] own works we start looking at our own
[1:40:21] ways and we start to try to approach him
[1:40:23] in our own rights in our own works and
[1:40:25] all that but those are filthy rags to
[1:40:26] him what we got to do is remember we
[1:40:29] come in his righteousness oh Lord I'm
[1:40:31] sorry I did all this I've apologize I I
[1:40:33] Repent Lord and I come before you father
[1:40:36] God and Lord I ask your forgiveness and
[1:40:38] we humble ourselves before him and we
[1:40:40] come in his righteous Lord I have no
[1:40:42] righteousness but the blood that was
[1:40:43] shed that covers me I'm robed and you're
[1:40:45] righteous I'm robed in that blood that
[1:40:47] was shed for me I am robed and I'm
[1:40:49] stepping forth before you tonight and
[1:40:50] I'm 74th and I'm coming into your
[1:40:52] presence and you start worshiping
[1:40:53] remember and I'm just going to
[1:40:55] paraphrase that what goes on here Esther
[1:40:57] comes in before the king and she just
[1:40:59] starts worshiping and she finds favor
[1:41:01] because she come in the right attitude
[1:41:03] she come in and not her own rights but

[1:42:32] the message of the hour let's just
[1:42:33] fortify ourselves in the word of the
[1:42:35] hour let's let's do that and the whole
[1:42:37] time Satan's like well he didn't she
[1:42:39] didn't ask for anything
[1:42:42] you know what Satan doesn't know who we
[1:42:44] are
[1:42:46] he doesn't know who's bride and who's
[1:42:47] not brave
[1:42:49] well you could tell who's not bright
[1:42:50] sometimes but the way they act or if
[1:42:52] they walk away and all that and that
[1:42:54] kind of stuff but the true bride he
[1:42:56] doesn't know who she is
[1:42:57] he can't recognize her
[1:43:00] and all of a sudden the second time
[1:43:02] comes around and she's worshiping him
[1:43:05] the King Xerxes and she's feeding him
[1:43:07] and she's filling him up and he goes oh
[1:43:10] Esther
[1:43:11] what is your desire
[1:43:13] oh that you would get rid of this Haman
[1:43:15] that you would get rid of the Satan out
[1:43:16] of my life he's tried to bring cancer
[1:43:18] into my life he's taken my son he's
[1:43:20] taken my joy he's taken my happiness
[1:43:22] he's trying to give me anxiety he's
[1:43:23] trying to give me depression he's trying
[1:43:25] to do all this to me oh if you take who
[1:43:27] is it who is it who is it it's this hate
[1:43:29] right here and all of a sudden he was
[1:43:31] taken to the Gallows and it was cast out
[1:43:33] of her life and the last thing he's
[1:43:34] saying was the bride the last thing he's
[1:43:36] saying was the bride was they put the
[1:43:39] The Hangman's
[1:43:41] I don't know what it's called cover over
[1:43:44] his head
[1:43:48] because he was running away you know
[1:43:51] but you know what that
[1:43:54] though we have power over Satan right
[1:43:58] it didn't do away with that decree of
[1:44:00] death against us
[1:44:02] it didn't do away with the decree of
[1:44:04] death against the Jews in that day
[1:44:08] and you know what Esther had to go back
[1:44:10] before the king
[1:44:14] you know what she didn't hesitate this
[1:44:16] time
[1:44:32] amen
[1:44:35] I had just written down
[1:44:44] anyway she didn't hesitate to take a
[1:44:46] Time
[1:44:52] Glory
[1:45:06] and on that day the king of Xerxes give
[1:45:08] the house of Haman the Jews enemy over
[1:45:10] to Esther and the Queen
[1:45:13] so in that day he gave her Authority
[1:45:17] over Satan's kingdom
[1:45:20] in that day he gave the bride authority
[1:45:22] over Satan's kingdom
[1:45:25] he rendered Satan powerless
[1:45:29] though there was still a decree of death
[1:45:32] against him and Mordecai came to before
[1:45:35] the king for Esther had told him what
[1:45:38] was done the king took off his ring
[1:45:41] which he had taken from Haman and gave
[1:45:43] it to Mordecai and to Esther
[1:45:45] then set Mordecai over the house of
[1:45:47] Hammond and Esther speak yet again
[1:45:50] listen this time this time she didn't
[1:45:52] just hesitate she just went up to him
[1:45:53] and started speaking
[1:45:55] once she realized who she was while she
[1:45:57] got her victory over Satan well she got
[1:46:00] victory in her life she didn't hesitate
[1:46:02] hesitate this time and Esther spake yet
[1:46:04] again before the king and fell down at
[1:46:06] his feet and besought him with tears
[1:46:09] to put away the Mischief of Haman the
[1:46:11] agite and his device that he had devised
[1:46:14] against the Jews
[1:46:17] and the King held out the golden scepter
[1:46:19] towards Esther so the Esther arose and
[1:46:21] stood before the king and said if it
[1:46:23] please the king and if I had found favor
[1:46:25] in thy sight the king and the King
[1:46:27] seemed right before and it
[1:46:30] and the thing seemed right before the
[1:46:32] king and I'd be pleasing in his eyes Let
[1:46:35] It Be written to reverse the letters
[1:46:37] devised by Haman the son of a matter of
[1:46:41] we'll just call him ham the agite which
[1:46:44] he wrote to destroy the Jews
[1:46:46] which are in the king's provinces
[1:46:50] for How Can I Endure to see the evil
[1:46:52] that shall come upon my people or How
[1:46:54] Can I Endure to see the destruction of
[1:46:56] my Kindred then King Cersei set a nest
[1:46:58] to the queen and to Mordechai the Jew
[1:47:00] behold I have given Esther the house of
[1:47:02] Haman
[1:47:03] I've given him the authority over Satan
[1:47:07] and him they had and of Haman and him
[1:47:10] they have hanged upon the gods because
[1:47:12] he was laid his hand upon the Jews
[1:47:14] righteous also for the Jews as it like
[1:47:17] you and the king's name and sealed with
[1:47:19] the king's ring for the the writing
[1:47:22] which is written in the king's name and
[1:47:23] sealed which with the king's Ring made
[1:47:25] no man reversed so he couldn't reverse
[1:47:27] the decree
[1:47:30] but he turned around
[1:47:32] and he gave Esther Mordecai
[1:47:37] the Jews
[1:47:38] who has won or the type of the Bride
[1:47:44] the baptism the Holy Spirit authority of
[1:47:46] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:47:49] to write whatever decree she desired
[1:47:55] to overcome
[1:47:57] the decree of death
[1:48:01] think about that
[1:48:06] she was given the authority and
[1:48:08] signified by a seal signified by the
[1:48:10] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:13] that we the bride will have authority to
[1:48:17] say whatsoever we say to overcome death
[1:48:21] in our lives to overcome unbelief in our
[1:48:23] lives to put Satan to bed to put Satan
[1:48:26] at rest and you know they went out and
[1:48:29] they killed so many a lot of times we go
[1:48:31] out and we kill so many enemies in our
[1:48:33] lives we kill lust and we kill smoking
[1:48:35] maybe we kill drinking we killed this
[1:48:37] and we stopped there but you look under
[1:48:39] Esther they went out and then they came
[1:48:41] back and she went back to the King again
[1:48:43] he said do it again whatever your desire
[1:48:45] is you have authority you have up to
[1:48:48] half of the Kingdom you have you have
[1:48:50] just as much Authority as I do because

[1:48:56] given you the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:58] now you speak and you tell the Satan
[1:49:01] what he can and cannot do any Authority
[1:49:03] that Satan brings upon your life you've
[1:49:05] given him that Authority you've allowed
[1:49:08] it because God gave you the power if you
[1:49:11] are sitting here and you have the
[1:49:12] baptism of the holy spirit this morning
[1:49:14] or this evening
[1:49:16] do you have the baptism of the holy
[1:49:18] spirit this evening you have the
[1:49:21] authority to stand against Satan and say

[1:49:30] my life you ain't taking their life you
[1:49:32] got to go you've got to flee but if you
[1:49:34] stop right there he'll just come back
[1:49:36] the next day each day we have to
[1:49:38] exercise that Authority in our lives
[1:49:40] each day we have to exercise that
[1:49:42] Authority overcame come mind battles
[1:49:44] every day we got to exercise that
[1:49:46] authority to bring our kids into the
[1:49:48] message of the hour to bring them into
[1:49:50] revelation
[1:49:53] if you've got kids out there that aren't
[1:49:54] serving the lord they're yours
[1:49:56] you apply the token you use the word
[1:50:00] you speak it

[1:50:18] the authority of Christ The Living
[1:50:19] inside of us that gives us the authority
[1:50:21] to speak peace to our lives because this
[1:50:23] Authority speaks peace to the storms
[1:50:25] that come our way
[1:50:27] it gives us the authority to speak
[1:50:29] healing in our lives

[1:50:33] hounded with you speak to it and you
[1:50:35] tell it to be gone and don't just be
[1:50:38] with a wish you wash you and all that
[1:50:40] when it tries to come back you stand
[1:50:42] firm and say Satan I told you you have
[1:50:45] no part of me I told you you have to go
[1:50:47] and if I look I have the Holy Spirit
[1:50:50] here's the Signet this is my authority

[1:51:04] cattle unless God allowed you you
[1:51:06] couldn't take job's children unless God

[1:51:09] and oversteps my authority
[1:51:11] guess what I have authority to stand
[1:51:14] against you because she he and I are one
[1:51:18] so he won't override my authority
[1:51:23] because now I speak as him she is him
[1:51:29] we're in the last days it's the bride's
[1:51:32] message it's the bride is the message of
[1:51:35] the hour today she's the one living it
[1:51:37] the message lived through her the
[1:51:40] message of brother Brandon is being
[1:51:41] lived out through her it had to be put
[1:51:44] into action it couldn't just stand the
[1:51:46] prophet but it had to be put into action
[1:51:48] through a multi-membered body called the
[1:51:50] bride of Christ so that his glory could
[1:51:54] shine so that he could show off that it
[1:51:56] wasn't just me but it was what was
[1:51:58] behind me the whole time and why I did
[1:52:00] it
[1:52:01] I had to help me
[1:52:03] I wanted her to come into Glory
[1:52:07] I want her to shine right next to me
[1:52:11] even brighter than me
[1:52:15] because she is me
[1:52:22] the patman's vision amen cut every
[1:52:24] obstacle for human beings that they
[1:52:25] might be connected to the Garden of Eden
[1:52:27] no man I was going to choke it out but
[1:52:29] I'm I'm going to say this
[1:52:33] man is omnipotent
[1:52:36] you don't believe that but he is a man
[1:52:39] fully surrendered to God as omnipotent
[1:52:41] there's the key he had to be fully
[1:52:43] surrendered if you're still halfway in
[1:52:45] the world and halfway into God you are
[1:52:47] not omnipotent yet
[1:52:49] you have to be fully surrendered you
[1:52:51] have to have fully surrendered your life
[1:52:52] so that he can work through you so he
[1:52:54] has every fiber every being every
[1:52:55] thought every way in your life you have
[1:52:57] to be fully surrendered you cannot live
[1:53:00] a halfway life a lot of times we want to
[1:53:03] live a halfway life because we want the
[1:53:04] things of the world but we also want God
[1:53:06] in our life and it doesn't mix it's like
[1:53:09] oil water they don't mix the oil is
[1:53:11] going to flow to the top but the water
[1:53:13] life is going to sink down
[1:53:15] the oil of this world to show forth
[1:53:17] first
[1:53:18] because you're burying it
[1:53:21] but that Water of Life Will flow out of
[1:53:23] you if you give it a chance
[1:53:28] a man fully surrendered to God as
[1:53:30] omniping it did you did not he say it in
[1:53:32] Mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and
[1:53:35] don't doubt in your heart it'll come to
[1:53:36] pass you can have what you said what
[1:53:39] happens when two omnipotents meet when
[1:53:41] God and man come together two opponents
[1:53:44] two ineptids I've been pronouncing it
[1:53:46] wrong two omnipotents something's got to
[1:53:49] shake whatever you do whatsoever you'd
[1:53:51] say with that creative power of
[1:53:53] omnipotence of God knowing that he's
[1:53:55] promised it and he said it in his word
[1:53:57] it creates a power that goes out yonder
[1:54:00] and brings it to pass things that is not
[1:54:02] and makes them as though they are
[1:54:03] because two omnipotents have met there
[1:54:07] he stands oh isn't he wonderful
[1:54:12] two omnipotent men do you ever think
[1:54:15] that you are an infinite power
[1:54:17] when you are fully surrendered to God
[1:54:18] you are an omnipotent power and you have
[1:54:21] all full Authority
[1:54:23] to use the word
[1:54:26] not for your own Glory
[1:54:28] not for your own wants and desires
[1:54:31] but for his pleasure for his desires and
[1:54:34] what's his desires for you to have
[1:54:36] happiness joy long-suffering meekness
[1:54:39] among all that in your life that's his
[1:54:41] desire
[1:54:43] to manifest the fruits of the spirits
[1:54:45] and what are the fruits and Spirits it's
[1:54:46] him
[1:54:48] he is all those
[1:54:51] amen
[1:54:59] amen
[1:55:04] you are an independent
[1:55:11] we're facing here in our two subjects
[1:55:13] that we read and this is from shalom
[1:55:15] the two scriptures rather a very
[1:55:17] contrast one on the other and Isaiah it
[1:55:19] says arise and shine for the glory of
[1:55:20] God has come upon you the light is here
[1:55:24] and then the very next verse says gross
[1:55:26] darkness is upon this people
[1:55:27] and then
[1:55:29] then we are in a mystery of light and
[1:55:31] darkness isn't that our age
[1:55:34] we're in a mystery of light and darkness
[1:55:35] and then
[1:55:37] then my address to the church is Shalom
[1:55:39] peace let's find out what it's all about
[1:55:41] see we're facing this year with both
[1:55:43] Darkness and Light We Are The World is
[1:55:45] in one of the most chaotic times of
[1:55:48] darkness and it's ever stood and yet
[1:55:50] it's standing in again the Most Blessed
[1:55:53] light that ever did Shine
[1:55:56] we are in the darkest
[1:55:58] days we've ever seen
[1:56:00] yet the greatest light that ever shown
[1:56:02] on Earth is sitting in this building
[1:56:04] right here tonight
[1:56:07] it's sitting over in Switzerland and
[1:56:08] some meetings are there it's sitting
[1:56:10] down here in Lima Ohio it's sitting all
[1:56:12] over the world and it's called the bride
[1:56:15] of Christ
[1:56:17] arise Shine Let Your Light Shine
[1:56:22] the difference is just like it was in
[1:56:23] the beginning when there was gross
[1:56:25] Darkness upon the earth and the spirit
[1:56:26] of God moved upon the face of the water
[1:56:28] he said let there be light and God
[1:56:29] separated the light from darkness and I
[1:56:31] believe that we are now living in an
[1:56:33] hour again that when God is separating
[1:56:34] light from darkness and he's pressing it
[1:56:37] to the other side of the world that the
[1:56:39] light might be made manifest
[1:56:41] then the church the reason I say shalom
[1:56:43] to them is because that it's God's peace
[1:56:45] that's what I want to bring to you this
[1:56:47] morning for this New Year's is not
[1:56:49] looking back but we are looking forward
[1:56:51] to the breaking of a new day until there
[1:56:53] is something great laying ahead there
[1:56:57] where the years has been Joy that we've
[1:57:00] looked forward to the pressing the
[1:57:01] coming of the great light and now we can
[1:57:03] see the breaking over the horizon
[1:57:04] horizon of Realm it's breaking between
[1:57:06] Mortal and immortality we see it's the
[1:57:09] breaking between heavens and earth and
[1:57:11] an Earthbound sickness and troubled
[1:57:12] world into a bright shining day of
[1:57:14] immortal life and a moral body and a
[1:57:16] mortal Earth shall never pass away it's
[1:57:19] shalom unto the people unto the church
[1:57:22] now it's the light coming for the
[1:57:23] Believers but gross Darkness for the
[1:57:25] people
[1:57:26] that's where we are
[1:57:30] that is exactly where we're at today
[1:57:37] close with us here
[1:57:40] the message has moved from the prophet
[1:57:41] to the bride and these are my thoughts
[1:57:45] the message is moved from the prophet to
[1:57:47] the bride the prophet fulfilled maokai 4
[1:57:49] 5 and 6. He restored the words that the
[1:57:53] father's priests in the days of old it
[1:57:55] was the prophet's commission to do so
[1:57:56] and now we are standing in the bright
[1:57:58] age and we have a commission to go forth
[1:58:00] and prophesy again before many nations
[1:58:02] people tongues and kings
[1:58:04] a Living Word and Flesh manifested on
[1:58:06] Earth today
[1:58:07] the prophet has gone off the scene but
[1:58:09] the message didn't die with him
[1:58:11] the word has to have flesh living and
[1:58:13] breathing on the earth to work through
[1:58:14] and she the bride has become him
[1:58:17] the two United becoming one and now she
[1:58:20] is the final voice to the final age
[1:58:21] standing and proving that the second Eve
[1:58:24] would not fall that she would accept the
[1:58:26] whole word and eat the book and become
[1:58:28] one with it and prophesy again to the
[1:58:30] Fallen World
[1:58:31] that he is alive and working on Earth
[1:58:33] today it has to come through a living
[1:58:36] breathing flesh the tapes only won't
[1:58:38] work the Flesh of the Prophet has gone
[1:58:40] on from this world having restored of
[1:58:42] Fallen Eve to the word
[1:58:45] making her one with the word having
[1:58:47] completed
[1:58:48] his commission as it says in Revelations
[1:58:50] 10 7 then John a type of the bride was
[1:58:52] commanded by The Voice from Heaven
[1:58:54] Christ to take the book and eat it to
[1:58:55] Devour the word revealed through the
[1:58:57] message of the hour and prophesy again
[1:58:59] and put it on display in an action
[1:59:01] performing the same works as Christ did
[1:59:03] when he was on Earth Jesus Christ the
[1:59:05] same yesterday today and forever
[1:59:09] in a wedding who's on display
