couldn't see very yes just across America and was a very nice sunet we have there the Lord bless you all I from Montreal quec last Tuesday so I think the weather is kind of different with me right amen all right so I will with you again if you can stand to our feet let's turn our Bible the book ofers 23:3 numbers 233 verse 25 to3 you there you can say amen amen numbers 13 verse 25 to 33 and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the Cong of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness [Music] ofes and brought back work unto them and unto all the congregation and shield them the fruit of the Lamb Hallelujah yes sir and they told him and said we came unto the land we that th sented us and surely it floweth with mil and H and this is a fruit of Hallelujah nevertheless there people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are W and very great morover we saw the children of anit in the land of the South and the Hees and the jeites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and G steal the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome Hallelujah but the man that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than me and they brought an evil report of the land which they had sent unto the children of Israel saying the L through [Music] the okay I thought it was gold so I wanted to here the land through which we have gone to search is is a l that eat up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw is are men of GRA and then we saw the the songs of anak which come of the chants and we were in our own sight as gr Grasshoppers and so we were in their SES am the Lord his bless the of his word shall we have be seated thank you Jesus praise be the name of the Lord I want to give a little tile to my message this morning the message leing by the evidence of the new leaving by the evidence of [Music] the believe I TR to get some golden nuggets Hallelujah and put it in our pocket that as we travel along praise be the name of the Lord I greetings from Africa the S of the family Ghana in Nigeria Mali Uganda everywhere thank you Lord our Prophet told us about three Exodus told us about the first Exodus God raised up a prophet yes and he vate the prophet Ministry with a pillar of Fire and gave him a message for the people and exod means from a place to a in the days of Moses it was an exodos from a nation to a nation that's right amen amen in the days of Paul it was exodos from a religion to a religion yeah in the first Exodus it was from Egypt to isra the second Exodus was from judism to Christianity that's right then in the Third Exodus in these last days God have sent us a prophet also he has Ministry fire and he has given us a message also and this exodos is not from a nation to a nation not from a religion to a religion but from to glory amen and amen and in every Exodus there is what you call it produces what you call twins Hallelujah every Revival produces what TS right the last time we were fellowshipping around another Ephesians and we talk about josa and as we go ahead we will still talk about the ministry of josa in this God told Moses take a man from each right and send them to go his I was surprised that when I was reading the scriptures God told him that they should see how the land is right but God did not told them about the children of Han the all those but God knew that's right hallelujah amen God told him to go and search the land and bring a report after 40 days and he told them the land is Flowing with milk and honey the people went second the they saw all those things that God didn't tell them and they saw what God told them also amen and yet they came back and said yes we saw the light and they even brought an Evidence praise the name of Lord they brought an evident fruit of the L so this is it but yet we can't take it right the Lord have Mery they saw the EV fruit of it but yet they said we can take it that's right why can't they take it is because of the other things that they saw that God didn't tell them to look at praise be the name of the Lord they shift they are Focus From the message to the things around the [Applause] message to many backslide from the faith and they give irrelevant excuses that's supposed not to be your fose oh my God Church you have come to a place that you have to leave by the evidence of the new life amen we can leave on yesterday's testimony but going to leave by the evidence of the yes sir I told you before when we were in cage that they land they promised land to the Jews to the Gentiles our Promised Land is Our promised way the message of our day is our new now let us look at this Prophet that God used this estos Moses went to M and he brought the law that's right Paul went to Arabia 3 years he brought the law he brought the Revelation the days of the Prophet God took him to the Wilderness of he brought the revelation of the interpretation of the written way let read some CL as the Lord help us thank you Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah BL Jesus when God takes them there he takes them for a reason that's right he take Moses to the mountain for a reason see he take Paul to the death of Arabia for a reason that is why Paul said in Corinthians that my preaching is not by the eloquence of wisdom but by the revelation of Jesus Christ yes sir Paul did not meet Jesus by the flesh by Revelation by the same of fire and the same of fire That Came Upon Our prophet and says as theill of wrot the Bible the is my heart to praise be the name of the Lord yes sir let's see what the prophet of God have to say here let me see let me from this message this message was preach proving his way yes 1964 0816 paragraph 1 38 un let that let's go 139 not take my time 64816 parag 139 proving his word brother says don't you see in shs stop here a in the last days there is God to be a place prepared for the way to be made manifest am and we are now living by the evidence of the new land amen the Son of God see when those spies came back with the fruit of the land those fruits were evidence that yet there is a land that existed having those fruit of the L was to give them a blessed assurance hallah that we are more than able to possess it am no matter what goes around the evidence Hebrews loving yes faith is an Evidence of things not see is tangible hallelujah amen HEB love is a face is a substance now Faith is the substance of things hope for is a subance faith is tangible sir you hold of things hope for the evidence of things not yet seen so even though they have not seen the land the fruit of it to give them face that there is a land somewhere praise be the name of the Lord is evidence of Things Not Seen let's read Hebrews 11 is good for our not here yes Hebrews 111 to three faith now Faith is the substance of things hopeful the evidence of things not right for by it the ERS which Elders those that were sent to spy the lah they obtain a good report because of Faith through faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of God am so that things which are seen were not made of things we do appear That's right so the people should have hold on to that evidence right of what was from the L but you see I was so surprised I was so surprised in 27 read in numers he said numers and they told him and said we came onto the with thou send us and surely he flow milk and honey that should have been full St God Tau it the prophet spoke it and I believe it and not I believe it but no put that b in your pocket because we are called to be believe we are not called to understand Hallelujah because we can't understand everything and if you know anything you are D it is only a d that knows everything put the back in your pocket amen yes sir that's right unfortunately we are having investigative journalist in the messages today and they Brands and calls exm Believers and all they do on the Internet is to go and search search search and they are not looking for the fruit of the message but they looking for the fult of the message I don't need the F of his message I need the fruit of this message they can only show you the negative part but they can't you the good part they can show you fail prophecies but they can't show you the the fulfilled prophecies they can't take away the healings they can't take away the but with all the investigative journalism it does not prove wrong that's right yes sir said when it looks like the message is faing that is when God steps in the more they try to prove it wrong the more God indicate it yes sir how can a man preach the Mage for 40 years and come back and said that I breach it in ignorance and how can he now come back and unreach it and the people have delivered already and begin to come on Facebook and begin to blast the members who have left the church because of his fallacy and he is bold to say some are because they want to know the which truths thy way is the truth before God sent his message the Bible was there the Roman Catholic church has a bigest b does make the CH of God you go Muslim there is a Bible there go back to Africa some traditional their Bible there so having the Bible does not make you a by believe the Bible is what makes Chris that's so and when these things begin to go around people who are not positionally placed in Christ become Disturbed become confused in their minds and they also begin the investigative journalist work to se to prove but God has already done proving his way right let me read another quote here that would be good for us yes thank you Jesus Hallelujah I want to read from the message the unveiling of God 64 0614 m 64614 m on Ving of God paragraph 22 paragraph 22 he said now my subject this morning I trust that God will reveal this now my subject this morning I trust God reveal this and each time if you who takes the stat and list and I hope and trust that you have had a spiritual understanding of what god of what that God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out are we together church we listen to the T read the books the message comes out but you as an individual you need a spiritual understanding of what God is trying to say without speaking it out right that is the problem we have yeah without sing it out why to say here see it's a thing sometime we have to say things in such a way that it might te down it might bring some to go out yeah oh glory be to God when I see some the message I said God bless you you are fulfilling your part of the prophecy you are going out because you are not off in the beginning some to and some to B over but that has done purposely it must be done that way the people are building does around slip of FK that any man can have a slip of T and they hold up to judge a vated prophet oh Lord is that what we are called to look at no Breen we have come this far by his grace am yes sir we going to look forward and cross on for the mark of the higher calling in Christ Jesus sir Hallelujah that's right amen people are busy looking for what the prophet called Human Side in the days of mtin Luther mtin Luther King in the US yeah during that time when there was a lot of things going on somebody wrote letter and they were accusing of something he they claim he said that he did not say then he said so many times this is a woman's side but he didn't said that that is not what we we are called do let's see it here here in the message he cares do you care now paragraph 7 he cares do you care that is preaching 1963 0721 care you can he said now see I always asked you to be careful what you are listening to who is telling you that man the one you claim is a liar is telling you to be careful of what you are listening to can there is a good liar can a liar who knows is lying to you tell to be careful no sir he won't lie you he doesn't need to tell to be careful help you to live anything to be fallen by Li but if he is a liar then he's a good one be careful of what you are listening to see there is so much of it that is just the Human Side yes and unfortunately instead of believers to have spiritual discernment to take the spiritual side they hand on The Human Side to the spiritual side the Lord have Mery but always if there is something that goes for yeah there you go it will speak it is say the yeah there you even the VIS or anything The Vision on the platform in the audience you are doing to yourself it isn't God see God doesn't produce that V you do it by yourself by your faith in the Divine gift but what I want you to watch here God did not send us to look at the woman side of the prophet he a man born in the flesh B in sin he has his person life to live but that is not what we are called to see we have to see the ministry of the Prophet Vindicated by God amen because as long as he woman he will have fault because if he doesn't have fault then he's God it's only God that is perfect that's right but you see the devil is so wise right and he brings a mind of people from the m and looking at the woman side to judge the spiritual side help yeah that's right you see while we are reading this book of numbers while we are looking to Israel the prop how God deals with the natural Church Israel T how God deals with the spiritual Israelites that we are right the same way God deals with that when Israelite was in Egypt they were the people of God but when they came out of Egypt they became the Church of God the church is a call at and they come out with 2 million people and the prophet of God said mix Mor that's right so in every Revival it produces twist right there is a trueth and the false Vine right the presence of the false Vine does not mean there is the and remember without the Gen dollar they canot be counterfeit dollar the counterfeit is made out of the Gen one there is a gen experience of the B of the Holy Ghost and there is impersonation experience of the Bap of the Holy Ghost am thank you Lord Jesus what am I trying to say here the soall denominational Pentecostal two speaking in tongs there are nine spiritual gifts in the Bible Corinthians 13 the only two speaking in Tong as the evidence of the Holy Spirit that's right yeah but there is the holy spirit itself and there is the evidence and before you get the Holy Spirit or before you get the gift of the Holy Spirit you need the Holy Spirit itself yes then we can see the fruit of it but unfortunately the devil has given giving them the fruit for the Holy Spirit that's right so when they see the fruit of it they say oh speaking in Tong is the evidence of the Holy Spirit but speaking in Tong is not the evidence of the Holy Spirit it is one of the gift of the holy spirit so instead of seeking The Giver they seek the gift right but to seek The Giver because when you have a giver you automatically have a gift amen yes thank you Lord like little Daddy come home you a long Tri but oh but I B you I bought you a be I bought you said Daddy I need you I need you I don't need your gift there you go throw his hand around Daddy he said have Daddy to myself daddy have all of you we Believers must not be confused the way the world thinks if the denominational Christian don't takes speaking in tones for the evidence as the Holy Ghost and it is not we must not come to a time a place that will have what we call kind interpretation that's right amen and amen amen we have must come to a place that this great P of Christ that we have received must mean anything to in this world than any association and any friendship because this is our life blessed be the he said we saw it yet nevertheless the people be strong that in the land and the cities are and very great more we saw the children of Anna that is not what God ask there is a main thing and you got evidence is good enough for me because those who claim this message is false they can't produce the life that this message has produced that's right on the day of Pentecost Peter told them that this is that this what is happening is that with the prophet Jo prophesy brother came in the Gap to say before you have this hold that amen right before you hold this hold that so the spies that went to investigate the land and brought the fruit of the land were supposed to hold that amen as an Evidence before they get this but instead of holding onto that they were beginning to look at the right right the Lord help our church amen yes sir the am the land of thees DW the mountains and by the Sea and the coast of Jordan all those excuses does not mean anything yes sir y why don't you come to church you know the government we should shut up Church why don't you come to church if you don't get a v you don't have to come to church why don't you come to church if I don't have a Mas or somebody because somebody not wearing mask those are excuses sir now the is what about the flu we happen before the cor and the flu we had after the cor yeah that's right yes yes sir what is happening Believers need spiritual discernment brother said every believer need a little spiritual discernment to not good from wrong and run from good discernment itself is a gift but if you don't have a gift of discernment you need a lot of worship as a Christian and KH steal the people oh glory to God before most yes he did and that's what we are doing this morning right we are s in every cres every unbeliever and every exmed Believers and K Ste the people before Moses and said let go up at once and possess for we are well able to overcome it yes sir that is a man with vision that's right that's right that is a man with purpose he know what he saying you know what God has revealed to him oh praise be the name of the Lord I want to read from the mage that is 63 09 01 M 63 0901 M paragraph 229 and call to the people before Moses and said let us go up we are more than able toome it but the that went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we two against 10 right makes multitude right the 12 went to see the land 10 said we are not able two said we are able and they saw the land they saw the fruits of the land wow they were the eldest wow wow they took it 2 29 like the spies if they come right up here to the borderline and look over and said well I know it's there but the obstacles is too great the obstacles is too great we look like grasshoppers they push in the wilderness but call them borderline believers right borderline Bel he said don't just come this far say I believe the message don't come this far say I believe the message it is not enough that's right come into Christ amen you obey the messenger amen don't come this far and say I believe the messenger put stop right but you obey the messenger yes sir and how do you obey the messenger by doing what he says am Jesus says if you love me keep my Commandments am so keeping the Commandment of Jesus is a sign of your life love to him that's right so don't come this far and say I believe the message but obey the Messer yes sir your obedience the messenger is automatically translation of your believing of the message come into Christ you say well I believe everywhere he said that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it in your heart right then you must have to the very life that was in Christ being you when I see that I pass over you am in other words we don't want intellectual conception of the message we don't want the mental conception of the message we need the ritual revelation of the message in our heart obey the messenger come to Christ take the message and put it in your heart amen sometimes I look online I see you claim you left something that is false yet you are quoting that false man to defend your false claim what since you have left it I I thought you have forgotten anything about it but you still go back and pick the same of the man who cl to Define your point why he made this mistake and what is wrong from the same fult then you very Brant because since it is for you have forgot everything about it is there anything that you will have known in this new life that you call a new revelation that you have the Bible alone and you have rejected speak against The Messengers you could have pre the people without being known from what you have le the Lord help us yes sir 10 still the yes yes in another place the Bible said Joshua and have another state praise the name of the Lord thank you Lord they have another spirit that was not a human Spirit right right the Lord help us yes sir amen I said may the Lord help us and another Spirit you see Israel came too far that they came to a place they call it Kish right when they were crossing to some of the tri said you know what we will stay at the water here we are not willing to go we want the portion of the inheritance before Jordan not across Jordan wow borderline and they were okay with that they were okay with that you can go and they took the stone and make Memorial will tell our children children yeah but we don't have to cross Jordan and stay there we have to cross Jordan to set land am church we go to press on am yes sir of the Lord is getting closer each day each minute amen amen and may his appearing Rejoice your heart for the more you know him the more you love him the more you love him the more you want to know about him am it is like a young lady getting ready to marry next month or next year today oh I here the and anticipation is to meet that room right oh praise the name of the Lord but told us a story of a rich young man from the city that went to the Country Side look for Bri because his C girls have exposed everything already in the street he need a home maker a wife is a home maker that's right he a home maker a woman build at his house right so when he came the young girls in want to please him look around no this people can make a home and he saw one po girl washing the dishes and coming to throw the dish look at what I yes yes so all those girls inside were waiting for the for the boys to show themselves what they can do and he came around I'm and when the time was dry said the little girl was working and saving up sewing the cloying for the coming of husand right and as a bride of Christ Our Life in this end time must be the preparation for the rap in the message end time evangelism brother says the purpose of this message is to prepare the Bri for the rapture that's right not for everybody but for the right might be able to prepare for the Rapture so when the time was getting closer the day that he knew maybe he said I come in the fall season or come win time look at look at time is just beginning just ended prare to sing and those girls why are you so happy he said you don't know what is happening my brieg Grom is coming for you for [Music] me little girl look at your dress no he doesn't need he need like you so you don't worry wait coming was she was preparing and came and that day he went out the little of the house and met him and here comes the groom with the horse thank you Jesus she that knew that a groom was coming for her Was preparing for the coming of the the other on who didn't know were not bed that is why he took them onw he brings us back to Matthew [Music] 25 they were tell virgins and the Bible call them virgins but yet five was wise and five was fo yes the Bible call them wise and Bible called those foolish were foolish and what makes the difference is because when the time of theom was coming they all fell and a friend of the bre Grom scream and he said hold the Bri come and what happened those who were wise turn the and those who are foolish didn't have exra oil their Li they couldn't go to see so you see we need an extra oil in these days thank you Jesus and that extra oil is the holy spirit that g Revelation upon Revelation yes sir the life that we live is by Revelation the way we dress is by Revelation the way we talk is by Revelation that is why we sing the way we sing and we pre the way we preach and we preach by Revelation H we sing by Revelation praise be the name of leaving by Happ Lord help us this morning hallelujah thank you Father thank they said we look like grasshoppers before them here is 10 against two but the word of God is true what God have said is the final there are many evil report going out especially in this part of the world in Africa African believer don't have time for that no praise the name of the Lord you have been there you know how they worship God and praise God know you know unless they have lights how many have internet how many knows unless have the young ones but the old Papa and Mama they say Amen to the word that's all they need thank Lord thank you thank you Lord aesome Jesus thank you Jesus I go on the mission front and I go the mission churches and I pre to them without mentioning anything about the vers of the prophet and they believe because I pre them the Bible what makes them believe because the truth I receive from this message came from the Bible right and I show scrip that they believe and right there they are pastors and Cong Jesus CHR and we believe and you wonder so been so many years will come to what don't you believe what you are are coming in yes sir and you can't tell this new that a false life no because what they saw they believe it yes amen amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord last convention in Kenya I came with three TR that came from the den Nation

also Amen bapti in the name of Jesus Christ cross over to Kya baptizer the whole church there what is happening they have seen the evidence of the new land thank you and it is enough for them to possess amen yes sir amen they don't have time that's right investigating journalist they don't have time for that no see God predestined that man to name his child before com to know of any mess messenger and you can't tell went to theen they give you a tag and your name and the was and you have no idea see if God as not and is not proving his way I will have stopped this missionary work so many years but when I go on the missions I see the result of God I see healings I see Deliverance I see Life burn new amen amen amen amen amen amen so what we have to do is to live by the evidence of the new land that new land is not Millennium or the internal City no sir that new is of the hour we have The paent Possession we have the down payment and is good is not for us don't be discouraged don't let the and am and am no s amen we are not going to see all those things no right the Lord help us thank you Lord sir may the Lord help us yes sir let me read oh praise be the name of the Lord amen thank you Father amen you know I love SW when I preach in Kenya and Tanzania and the translate in their local language I to learn I was sharing some experiences I think the bre in in Kenya I was selling them in Mala when I'm preaching anding and I'm studying their local language I preach in English they translate until when The Interpreter make a mistake I stop andc correct them their local language and I tell them what I mean not what he said so I was telling the church in Kenya like that and just coincidentally I was preaching and the was making a mistake I stop him I said SBA I lion not what you are saying I'm not talking I'm saying lion Simba Sim and the you see it's wonderful like brother will be talking to somebody in Finnish you speak English and a Finnish girl was here finish y y That's right yes sir this is up is a truth she was hear in finish the prophet was speaking English thank you Lord I want to read from the message you know they don't have so can cat up he said they are like the children of Israel who came out of Egypt and sto shut of the promised land before the what the prophet said before preceding this was talking about the Ping the evidence of Tong as evidence of the Holy Spirit but I don't want to read that long I want to come to the main point I want you to have here he said the children of Israel who came out of Egypt they sto short of the promised land and that is where we must not come to short right Redemption isold coming out and entering so complete Redemption means coming out and entering to com without entering to is not a complete Redemption so they came out of Egypt all right but what happened they got short they stopped short of The Promise Land which must not be so or which must not be our Cas he said now those children of Israel left Egypt about 2 million the all together all saw the miracles of god all part of the same manner and water from the Spirit Rock all follow the same Cloud by day and the P of Fire by night but only two reach the promised land was Jesus all two reach the promised land right yes sir thank you Father thank you Lord only two were true or real believers that is correct right because the word tells us that the rest because of [Music] unbel unbelief oh GL Hallelujah right the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter in that is Hebrews 3:19 then since that is so and only two ended then the rest were not true believers what makes the difference what makes the difference to stay with the World and josua St with the word and that word say the is milk and honey full stop and is your God has given it to you that is enough hallelujah oh praise be the name of the Lord to St the way when the heart of the TP F at cish B josa and KH do not STG for they believe the word and said we are more than able to take the they knew they could because God has said I have given you the life Hallelujah this morning if you need healing I have given you healing if you need on your I have given you if you need bre I given you bre if you need of I have giv you fth whatever you need I giv you if you need children I giv you children hallelujah what you God I given you I have given you this land it it and it work and it work before work again that is we are more than able to the land they knew they could because God has said I am giving you the land after all those Israelites saw of the power and the goodness and deliverance of God they do not enter into the rest which is a type of the Holy Ghost so you can see right now that few very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of God Amen you see came to differentiate when the Baptist says have you received the Holy Ghost when you believe that mean I believe I receive the Holy Ghost but said no sir he say since you believe yeah that's right from the time you believe have you received the Holy Ghost oh praise be the name of the Lord amen let me read Corinthians 10 was not part of the not coming I believe Corinthians 1 Corinthians 10:1 can put the board we can read it together amen First Corinthians 10:1 moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea praise be the name of the Lord amen and we all baptized unto Mes in the cloud and in the sea yeah that's right and did all eat the same spiritual meat yes sir and then all drank the same spiritual drink for they drun of the spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ First Corinthians 10 verse 5 but with many of them was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wers that's right verse six now these things were our as that's right yes sir yeah SS of God these things were our examples these things were our examples let us s in these things were our [Music] examples First Corinthians now these things were our examples to the intent we should not last after evil things as they also last neither be Idol as where some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat drink and Rose up and play we don't come to church to play church right no we don't come to church to be entertained they eat and drink and go up to BL right right as see nothing is happening but something is happening and something is fixing to happen yes yes sir nothing concern them they come to CH when they like and they don't come to when do like wow you pay don't like nobody tells me anything I do what I like people's right you don't pray unless they in [Music] trouble Africa the hardship economic hardship will let you learn how to pray right you trust God Providence cred card is not there for you right amen that's right we must be on fire for God hallelujah we must be on Revival constantly that's right we must praise God in winter or in summer am yes the change water must not affect our faith or our standard right that's right the people sat down to eat and drink and to play oh Lord help us neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day 3 and 20,000 neither let us Christ as some of them also tempted and will destroy of serent neither Mama ye neither M ye as some of them also M and were destroyed of the Destroyer amen now all these things happen unto them for examples are you not glad to have an example to look upon Lord have Mery right there all these things happen for examples and they are written for admonition upon whom the end of of the world are come right there you go where let he stand therefore let that stand take amen thank you Jesus SS of God are we catching something are we catching something Church it is a revelation of God that separate us from the world right we have to believe the testimony of the true Elders why the 10 Elders were given foral report the two El were giv good report right and we have to come to a place to believe that true report right yes sir I want to read my last from from the church ages this is also from the P Church age there's paragraph but I believe you canat it up the bride do only his will right those in the bride not those in the church right so when somebody's in a church does not do the real of the word he's a church member of course but those the Bri will do only his will right I do wonder how can there be a promised land for you and you say I want to be encourage by before J I'm okay you guys

sister this land is Flowing mil upon we have seen the evident fruit of it oh yes yes sir there is no Revival that can be compared to this revival said through all the Revival it lasted for 3 years but this the only Revival that have lasted over 50 years right and it's still going on praise be the name of the Lord amen we must stop sh of the promised land but we must leave by the entrance of the promised land yes sir that's right this is real real it is not a me of very tell it is real that's right yes sir thank you Lord yes those that are bright do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thou say Lord or the K amen yeah they have the Lord oh they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own work God in doing the work fulfilling his own work y y amen Jesus he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in through the right yes oh praise amen yes in his ministry Jesus did not conclude his work he left a portion for the bride of Christ oh my God what a horor to conclude and complete the vision and the ministry of Jesus Christen thank you Lord thank you Father Jesus he work in Judah she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now am but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time amen praise be the name of the Lord Jesus you know in Isaiah 61 when the Bible was talking about a rise and shine praise be the name of the Lord let me read that scripture then we come back here the Bible mention certain things there and when Jesus came he read that same scripture but he left the portion that scripture was not fulfilled in this day it is our day to be fulfilled here thank amen Isaiah 61:1 the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord had anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the Meck he had sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to proclaim the LI to the captives and the open of the prison to them that are B to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort them all them that oh blessed be the name of Lord you see this scripture we ready here then you go to Luke 4 verse 18 or we can start 4 16 let's go 16 so that you can get the story Luke 4:16 and he came to n where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the syag God on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophets Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written yeah that was by predestination amen right he found the place God made his eye to fall that place because there was a purpose and what place was it the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had arranged me to bring the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the broken heart to to pre Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set Al Liberty them that are BR to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen the verse 20 says and he closed the book and he came it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the C God were fasting on him now let me ask that question in Isaiah 61 that read There is a portion verse 12 yes you can go back to Isaiah 61 vers 12 let's see something when he got to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord there is a conjunction there verse 12 the con was and the day of veng of our God Isaiah 61 Isaiah 61 verse 2 sorry 1 and two he said to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance for God to comfort all that but in Luke what that scripture wased he left that portion am praise the Lord amen let's go back look and see something ver 20 Luke 4: 20 now or verse 19 so that we understand it better to preach acceptable year of the Lord but didn't continue the day of Vengeance of our God and the scripture say ver 20 and he PL the and he gave it again to the minister and sat down Oh Glory Hallelujah and when he sat down so follow us here like this the SC said all eyes were face on him right praise be the name of the Lord when he sat down all eyes were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day this scure is fulfilled in your eyes praise be the name of the Lord now in this end time the proph went somewhere to preach and the Bible the wife gave as a gift the new
