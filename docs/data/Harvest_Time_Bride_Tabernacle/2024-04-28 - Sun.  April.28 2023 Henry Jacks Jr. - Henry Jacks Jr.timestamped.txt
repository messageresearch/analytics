[36:21] chapter
[36:22] 6 praise the Lord
[36:29] we're going to read a few verses we're
[36:30] going to look at um verse 61-
[36:35] 63 when Jesus knew in himself that his
[36:40] disciples murmur at it he said unto them
[36:43] don't this offend you right what he knew
[36:46] was what he said back here in verse
[36:49] 54 whosoever eateth My Flesh and
[36:53] drinketh my blood at eternal life and I
[36:58] will raise him up at the last day for my
[37:02] verse 55 for my flesh is meat indeed and
[37:06] my blood is drink indeed he that eateth
[37:10] my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth
[37:14] in me and I in him these are very strong
[37:18] statement Hallelujah verse 57 as the
[37:22] living father had sent me and I live by
[37:26] the father so he he that eateth me even
[37:29] He Shall Live By Me Oh God we are called
[37:33] to eat
[37:35] Christ amen we're called to heit him
[37:39] praise God verse 58 this is that bread
[37:43] which came down from heaven if you go
[37:46] back further in the in the same chapter
[37:48] they were talking about man right yes
[37:51] you know Moses our fathers eat Mana in
[37:53] the wilderness and Jesus said though
[37:55] they eat Mana they are dead Hallelujah
[37:59] so he was shifting their focus shifting
[38:02] their mind from the Mana to himself I am
[38:07] the living bre but he was not speaking
[38:10] to them in our literal way but they
[38:13] misunderstood that and they thought that
[38:15] he was speaking literal but it was
[38:19] spiritual Hallelujah because everything
[38:22] that Jesus said he was speaking in a
[38:24] spiritual sense but in order to it the
[38:28] Bible said in 1 Corinthians 2:14 the
[38:31] natural man cannot understand the things
[38:34] of God it is foolishness unto him
[38:38] Hallelujah because it is spiritually
[38:41] designed amen hallelujah he said as your
[38:45] fathers did eat mana and are dead he
[38:49] that eateth of this bread Hallelujah
[38:52] shall live forever hallelujah hallelujah
[38:58] praise God so because he said these
[39:01] things it offended
[39:03] them I tell you there's something about
[39:06] the truth the truth can cause offend and
[39:09] the truth can
[39:11] liberate
[39:12] hallelujah praise God the truth liberate
[39:16] us hallelujah that's why we sing the
[39:19] song I am free I'm no longer bound no
[39:24] more trains holding me Hallelujah
[39:28] praise God go back to verse 60 63
[39:33] now verse 62 what and if you shall see
[39:38] the son of man asign up where he was
[39:42] before it is the spirit that Quicken it
[39:46] Hallelujah can I repeat that can I
[39:49] endorse on that it is a spirit that
[39:52] Quicken it not the word that's right not
[39:56] the letter
[39:58] now the letter cannot Quicken it that's
[40:00] right it takes a spirit to Quicken the
[40:02] letter amen because the letter kill it
[40:06] but the spirit give
[40:08] life glory to God
[40:13] hallelujah he said and the flesh profit
[40:16] nothing that's right though Jesus
[40:19] understood that they that they thought
[40:21] it was literal he was saying you see
[40:23] this flesh it profit nothing without the
[40:26] spirit in this flesh it profit nothing
[40:30] amen hallelujah oh glory to God that's
[40:33] why it is important to have the baptism
[40:36] of the Holy Ghost
[40:37] [Applause]
[40:39] Hallelujah it is important to have the
[40:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost it takes the
[40:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost to give you
[40:48] Revelation
[40:50] hallelujah oh you can be seated
[40:53] Hallelujah I just get excited I'm sorry
[40:55] to keep you standing so long I'm just
[40:58] excited about the word hallelujah glory
[41:01] to God remember in St John 1 the Bible
[41:06] said the word was made flesh amen
[41:10] hallelujah and dwelt Among Us amen and
[41:14] we beheld his glory as of the only
[41:17] begotten of the father amen he said
[41:20] heing was full of grace and truth yes
[41:24] sir
[41:25] Hallelujah so without the Holy Ghost we
[41:29] know the Holy Ghost Inside of us though
[41:32] the word is the seed of God and once the
[41:36] word is been so in that heart amen which
[41:40] is the good ground yes it takes the
[41:43] spirit to Quicken that word so that it
[41:45] become alive amen hallelujah so that it
[41:49] become accelerated yes you know when
[41:52] you're driving a a a a motor vehicle and
[41:55] you put your foot and the gas it
[41:59] accelerate so we it with the Holy
[42:03] Ghost you accelerate in the Rapture you
[42:08] accelerate in the body of Christ you
[42:12] accelerate in the resurrection
[42:14] Hallelujah you accelerated in Grace you
[42:19] accelerated in Mercy
[42:22] amen
[42:24] hallelujah oh praise the god the word
[42:29] Quicken
[42:31] Hallelujah it
[42:33] means glory to God hallelujah it means
[42:37] to make
[42:39] alive right glory to God you see that it
[42:43] means to give life that word Quicken the
[42:47] Greek word it is pronounced
[42:51] zo Z which means to give life
[42:57] that's the difference between the
[43:00] quickening spirit and the living
[43:04] Soul the Bible said in 1 Corinthians 5
[43:07] verse 47 and Adam was made a living Soul
[43:13] yes sir but Jesus was made a quickening
[43:17] spirit sir there's a difference there
[43:21] the quickening spirit gives life yes sir
[43:25] to the spirit amen amen Adam couldn't
[43:28] give life to the spirit yes sir because
[43:31] he was made of a living soul but Adam
[43:34] could give life to the flesh that's why
[43:37] Jesus tell Nicodemus he that is born of
[43:40] the flesh is of the flesh but he that is
[43:44] born of the spirit is of the spirit amen
[43:48] hallelujah praise God glory to
[43:53] God
[43:55] hallelujah amen
[43:58] do you love him this morning yes sir
[44:01] praise God when Jesus speak these things
[44:05] in St John 6 he was in in
[44:09] Galilee and Nazareth is in Galilee that
[44:13] was about Galilee was about 80 to 85
[44:17] miles away from Jerusalem right yeah
[44:20] remember Jerusalem was of the kingdom of
[44:22] the South Hallelujah Judah there was two
[44:26] Kingdom in that time when Jesus came the
[44:29] kingdom was splitted in two you have the
[44:33] kingdom of Judah that was in the South
[44:35] yeah and the Kingdom of Israel that was
[44:37] in the north amen Jesus was born in
[44:41] Bethany which was in
[44:43] Jerusalem Hallelujah but he grow up in
[44:47] Nazareth that's why they call him Jesus
[44:50] of Nazareth that's
[44:52] right and the disciples came from
[44:55] galileans that's why act to ear these
[44:58] men of um galileon and know they speak
[45:02] in our own
[45:03] language Hallelujah so these disciples
[45:07] they came from galileans is it not right
[45:10] according to Acts chapter 2 but here
[45:14] hallelujah in St John 5 Jesus was in
[45:17] Jerusalem Hallelujah but then in St John
[45:21] 6 he left Jerusalem and went back to
[45:24] Galilee to the Sea of tiberious
[45:27] Hallelujah and here he was speaking
[45:29] about Hallelujah the the bread of life
[45:33] right when you read St John 6 the Bible
[45:37] said they came to him and he turned to
[45:40] his disciples what we have can feed
[45:43] these persons he said it just to prove
[45:46] them God can say things to you just to
[45:49] prove you right amen because he want to
[45:51] test you that's
[45:54] right do you know that God can give you
[45:56] a s
[45:57] yeah just to see what you would do with
[45:59] that stick right Hallelujah that's how
[46:03] he works right he gave the prophet Moses
[46:07] a stick right he said Moses whatever you
[46:10] do you just stretch those stick right
[46:13] but then Moses relied so much upon the
[46:17] staff when it was time for him to move
[46:19] away from the staff God said to Moses
[46:24] speak to the rock that water make come
[46:27] for it God can bring you to a level
[46:31] where he allow you to use this piece of
[46:33] paper and then in his appointed time
[46:37] he's ready to shift you away from the
[46:39] paper right and God was doing that to
[46:43] Moses Israel and Moses R so much on the
[46:47] stick Hallelujah when Israel saw Moses
[46:50] Tres the stick they knew that Miracle is
[46:53] going to

[55:39] of my father they are my mother there my
[55:44] brothers Hallelujah yes sir it's about

[55:50] that's what God is using today

[56:59] can't even tell you Heavenly things

[57:20] believe sir they shall speak with new
[57:23] tongues that word new tongues means
[57:26] language it means
