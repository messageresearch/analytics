according to your plan we give you the glory for it in your name amen amen you may have your seats Amen Let just uh I started to say there just remember remember you know as life changes and and you know brother Braham said if we're going to pray for somebody we have to understand or walk in their their shoes and and uh and uh you know you all have your own shoes and as as your friend and Pastor I feel for you and we pray for you amen regularly and families and um amen but sister Patty is in a hard situation she's she's a difficult situ uation she in time will make have to make hard decisions very hard decisions amen just read she had a very hard life sometimes life ain't easy amen just remember her amen I I know each one of you have your own story and your own struggle but she she has a struggle amen and God know knows and God has a reason and God has a plan amen amen amen amen well I promised you last Sunday that I preached two messages so I'd be really short this Sunday so whatever I don't get done I'm just going to use on Wednesday night amen but I I want to share some thought with you that uh I I'll just tell you right up front will be misunderstood but I I pray it isn't but brother Bram said that when he preached on this he said it wouldn't matter what I say on this topic you will misunderstand me it won't matter what I say it won't matter which way I but please don't do that brother Dale has no agenda I have less than zero desire to uh to control God's people or to give you advice that you don't agree with or even Doctrine amen and uh and I believe that we're free moral agents and you can make good decisions when you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but I'm going to show you something that's in God's word and brother Brown preached it and I'm going to even read some scriptures if I don't get them today that I understand I and studying that they're met for multiple reasons and brother Brown said multiple times that all scripture and prophecy has got a compound meaning he said many times that it's circles around and around again or it's for different times and different years and many times in the Old Testament that the scripture is wrote from a from a Earthly or fleshly perspective but it meant for a spiritual perspective and then I would share a scripture if I get to it today that we know that Jesus come up and he meant it from a spiritual perspective from Israel but it's wrote from a physical perspective for us today and you know we can uh I I'm sorry that it's just this way but you know we can preach on the Seven Seals and we have and we could preach on the two prophets that are going to come to Israel and God will turn his eyes to Israel Grace will then end at that time we will go in a Rapture Grace will not end until the bride is gone in a Rapture and God turns his attentions to the Jews and we can talk about all those things and they're true and we should talk about them but many of those things for the young kids and the young people in school will do absolutely nothing to change their life or help them live a Christian Life I mean it it's the mysteries of life and they're true and they're real and they're amazing and there's something that you need to know but if we dwelt on them and I would feel sorry for anybody that has a pastor that all they preach on is the mysteries in the word of God and these things because uh uh there's just uh more in God's word than these things amen and so please again th this is is is not this is however you feel it's for you but it's not brother Dale cramming this down your throat but we have a problem and we've had a problem and Vicky you can put out my first picture but make sure you do the right one amen we had a problem in the past of slavery and we still have that problem today and and many Christians are being mocked by Satan because of the simple principles that God has in his word amen now we we just uh I I like I said I'm going to promise I'm going to go slow with this and uh and if we don't finish we will we'll pick it up when God allows but we recognize this kind of slavery very easily very easily and and it's disgusting from every angle amen but sitting in the bride of Christ is the same similar type of slavery and Satan has pulled over us and we've Justified oursel upside down to justify it and we've been wrong and i' I I got some amazing things that God's dealt with me and I I was even sharing this with ministers around the world and some of the ministers said he said I've never seen those things that brother Brown said never you know we'll justify the ministry or we'll justif we can just ify anything in the word of God we'll say oh God's behind us and praise God you know I can do it be careful be careful cuz you could be going down a path that God's not behind at all amen and many times we're like balam in the Bible you know balum was you know he he sold his soul for money but he was God's anointed and and he had a problem with money and he knew that he was making mistakes and you'll read it in the chapters in Numbers 22 where balum even comes back and that's where God stops him on the road with the donkey and speaks through a donkey God forbid he would have to speak through a donkey today unless it was brother Dale but uh balam comes there and repents and says God I'm wrong like I mean it was black and white I'm wrong I've sinned and I'm going to change and he went right out the very next day and Contin you down the exact same sinful road that God had already showed him was wrong amen God help us to break the chains of the yolks that are binding us because you know everything in your physical life dictates how you can serve God spiritually let me resay that your physical environment Dix takes 100% your spiritual environment now you say oh no wait a minute I can put oh yeah just try being sick in the hospital on a coma and worship God uh-huh amen and I want to go into uh some examples brother Brown and show you a lot of of scriptures here but with this first scripture we'll see here that brother Brown said as he says I always tell young couples that happy happiness does not consist of the world's Goods that you own but how content you can be with the portion that's allotted to you and then that that exact same quote he gives the example he had young people that would come to him and they had absolutely nothing and it will shock you that brother Brown still married them you w guaranteed you w it I've heard ministers say you don't you have no right to get married until you have money you have support that's not what a prophet beli and he went to the people that mared that were so wealthy that their door knobs on their house were gold 14 karat gold and he went by and seen the poorest of the poor and the people that had the 14 karat gold doorknobs and he said I would rather be in the poor people's life than in the rich people's life amen now brother Bram says and I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm taking my time I'm clarifying this there's nothing wrong with being having money and I believe been being like The Ant and preparing for winter I believe like Solomon's wife that she was uh sold for winter time cuz you would freeze to death and we have to have a warm house and we have to have a roof to keep rain off our head and if you have lots of money in the bank praise God for it and that won't keep you out of Heaven as long as it ain't your God but I want you to recognize some things that Satan has pulled over on us and we've swallowed them Hook Line and Sinker he said about 25 years ago or around that fact that God showed me and I'm so glad I woke up to it that happiness doesn't consist of these Earthly Treasures but it consists of Eternal things that makes our soul happy amen and here let's just goool maybe uh uh maybe we can leave this uh well you can we'll maybe leave the picture if that's easy for you Vicki first John 25 and 17 love not the world nor the things of the world and if any man love the world the love of God is not in him now we we know that scripture and we have it memorized sideways and and and we think of it spiritually speaking for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abides forever now I'm going to skip my Isaiah scripture and maybe come back to it Proverbs 22:1 and then we're going to change our picture Vicki Proverbs 22:1 a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver or gold now I'm going to tell you something you can have [Music] both you can have both so I'm not preaching against I I don't care if your house costs I mean amen I don't I'm driving a nice car brother Dale is driving a nice car and you can have a brother Dale might build his sweetheart a nice house someday nothing wrong with that that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about a different angle watch this here but the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is a slave to the lender and you can do whatever you want to that scripture you can throw it in the garbage but it's in the word of God and brother Brown talked about it and Paul wrote it here and it there's many many script do you know I want to show you something do you know that there's more talked in the Bible about money and stewardship of money than there is salvation or the Holy Ghost that's a amazing amen God help us here let let me read another scripture VI you before we bring up Jeremiah 29:11 and4 for I know the thoughts that I think towards you now God gave his scripture for his for our obedience to what he pre-plan for us in our future I know the thoughts that I think towards you and this ain't just spiritual because then we wouldn't believe in Divine Healing but God give care about our healing amen and and see we're living in a world well let me finish this here the thoughts of peace and not of evil and to give you unexpected end and then you shall call upon me you shall you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and you shall find me and when you shall search with me with all your heart notice say says all your heart all the word of God you will find me sayith the Lord and I will turn away from your captivity now don't just think in the the sense of soldiers captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places hither I have driven you sayith the Lord and I will bring you again to the place hence and cause you when I cause thee to be carried away I know this is talking about Israel in a physical sense but remember our Prophet said multiple times about a dozen times or more that all scriptures and prophecy has compound meanings and I want to show you something that whether you admit it or not and I this ain't for some of these scriptures uh some of this thing we can't just preach to the older mature ones in the message all the time we got to hit H the the teenagers and the brother dalees because I'm just a teenager at heart and so this message is for me because people are building their lives you might be at the end of your life but there's other people just starting their life amen and we're living in a world where there has never ever in history been more mental illness in the churches don't worry about the world in the message and more depression inside a message churches amen now did God thoughts for you to be depressed how in the world you're you're the bride of Christ this morning so you have eternal life that's just facts you came from God he's the only person that was eternal and so that makes you Eternal you're and there's people in that state that would take medication for depression wow and almost 100% of the time it's because of slavery maybe not always but almost 100% of the time it's because of slavery do you know that the number one probably the dead number one cause of divorce in North America is based on money number one ahead of anything else even other things money you know brother Bram said and and if I scroll down to it I'll just paraphrase it I'll come to it I'll repeat it he said you're putting your hopes in a piece of paper that within 5 years that was in the' 40s in 5 years it'll be worthless now now I know what you're thinking cuz Satan told me he said well brother Brown made a mistake no he didn't it's called inflation it's exactly worthless do you know that you can Google inflation by the Banks and it was the world's Bank plan to trick you to think that you're working for the same amount of money or more and you're actually working for nothing well that's what Google will tell you you don't have to believe your pastor and your Prophet said that 5 years ago that would have been about 70 years ago that what you're putting in your hopes now I'm not saying you are will be worth zero amen and I and this is everybody has to work out their own for their own uh household I'm not I'm not I'm not going there but I I don't believe it's wrong to money if you need to you have to have a house to live in so you're going to you you you can rent or borrow money for a house that's your choice brother Bram talked about paying your bills he said he said I don't mean owe no man Nothing by like don't have a hydro bill or don't have a water bill we're not talking about that you know you'd get thirsty if you didn't have water and you'd get blinded if you didn't have lights but what we're talking about is the love of the world that who has the most toys isn't who wins amen and and the toys are something that just are a trick to us and so you can pull up next preacher and I'll read a scripture he said here brother Brown's talking about money he said he said everything's paid up he said we never left the city owing a and he said everything was taken care of and he said I don't believe in anything else than that and he said you must you mustn't owe anyone he said you must be square and straight and you say owe no man nothing and go face to them and tell them that you owe them but you'll give them a little time and you'll pay it that's always better it's a mark of a good Christianity being honest and upright he said watch here stay close to Christ and he said let me warn you now and as a minister of the Gospel it don't take any foolishness don't imagine anything say right here United inside on the inside anchored in the word right in Christ because the only thing that's going to every is going to deceive this age that we're living in and if you're deceived it'll if it were possible it would be as close to the elect because they have the anointing and they can do anything like the rest of them now he's talking about people deceiving us so watch this he said now now this is our prophet he said now clean up your lives and pay your debt oh no man nothing Jesus said now I don't mean like your house rent and stuff you got to do that but he said get all these things off your hands he said get anything get everything right and make ready get ready remember that the name in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen amen that's what our Prophet said see if we get so cluttered in our mind there's actually people that are are you can't help it that they're so involved with their families or their kids or their toys and stuff and we have an evil thing in this day and you can pull up the picture Vicki and and I have one so so you can throw stones at me too but there's modern-day slavery right there where you can go on your phone and you can call up Amazon and you can order something that you don't even want or need they know that they're you're even thinking about it and I I know I don't mean to offend anybody this morning and and but we're living in a world here where we have 50 pair of shoes you can't wear 50 pair of shoes and I have a separate closet from my wife cuz our clothes are still they won't fit and our closet bar is like 7 ft long yeah amen that's an addiction no no brother Dale's in an addiction in what kind of a world do you have to have I I couldn't even dream how many pair of shirts I would have hundreds how why amen you don't never used to be whereever advertisement was everywhere and it used to be that it was it when it came out into the World War II or after that it was on signs and you know you had to get the Sears catalog and it was on paper now you pick up your phone and you you could be doing anything and advertisement ads will come up and say buy me and if you don't buy me I'm half PR you're an idiot you say but I was just going for breakfast and now I'm into buying long johns hello yeah it's because Satan knows that if he overwhelm you notice that the the the the Bible scriptures don't pop up like that do you notice that quotes just don't pop up like that this is coming from Satan to bombard us with with things that we're not even W you weren't even thinking of buying a new hat which I love or you know what I'm saying and so instead of praying for your your kids or your wife or that now you're on Amazon or wherever because of these cards now I now listen now we live in a modern world and me and brother Carson couldn't cost a bridge without having a card and brother cars and I actually asked him to use his card because of personal reasons mine is ridiculous but I wonder if that's part of God's plan I'll show you it's not I'll show you that your Prophet said he told God he said multiple times this was the the quote I sent to other ministers you know brother Dale could go to the mission field and I have borrowed money on my line of credit by God's scriptures and the message I shouldn't go I'll say it for you ouch that was the ouch for me cuz brother Bram told God he said the day you sto paying the bills for my Ministry the day I stopped preaching and he also said you'll never talk about money or pull for it because see he believed that God was Supernatural and he believed that God could do anything and God owns the cattle on a thousand hills and you don't need a minister to tell you what to do with your money so that see I I already established that Foundation this morning I'm not telling you what to do with your money you have your own mind and you have your own Holy Ghost and you have to talk to God about that and if you have a minister that ever comes and tells you what to do with your money it'll almost always regard something that's self- serving and that's disgusting yeah amen and so watch this when I was dealing with so I was talking to ministers and I know this can I step out of the side let me go to the other side of the road for a minute I was talking to ministers around the world where they don't have much money and they were going to do things for God and I said do you have the money they said well no I said you're out of God's will like they almost wed the phone I said well like if you're in God's will God will pay all his own bills yeah whose kingdom are you working for see if I travel the world to say I'm ministering but I'm and I have a thirst for popularity I'll borrow the money oh that burns me am it burns a lot of other ministers too that's why you don't hear it preached so oh I'm a I'm a servant of God and the people and I'm I God has a standard God has a standard brother Braham said if you can't go yourself you could send somebody but you don't need to tell nobody who you're going to send or when the Bible clearly says that a servant's worthy of his labor so people that go around and labor for God and don't get a chicken or or a cob of corn or a potato or an egg or's something wrong with this picture now I know this is kindergarten for all of us but we got to get out of kindergarten because we have a slavery here you know I had a brother that that got me thinking of this months ago months ago and he was from Pakistan and I commented on this post and you can put up the next one Vick you had both of them and I commented on his post and he said brother Dale he said there's family Generations that are slaves in the big fact the brick Factory for like 10 bucks 20 bucks five bucks because interest interest in the Philippines when you plant your rice is 60% interest 60 that's six and then the zero God never ever intended for believers to be in this trap and that interest ain't going to God's kingdom it's going to the World Bank which will be part of the One World Government in Rome amen now listen now let's balance this if you didn't have a house mortgage you'd have to pay rent okay nothing wrong with that you you must have a house to live in period it in Canada because we're spread out it'd be hard to ride a bike to church brother Dale would not have a weight problem if I rode a bike to church and if I brought a pony it wouldn't have a weight problem either so I'm not talking about your needs but does do we remember the scripture says that I will supply your needs according to my riches and Glory so we buy our kids something and they play with the box and you're caught in a trap because you put it on your card yeah amen your kids don't love you no l they your kids could care less whether they got those new coold toys you think of what you older ones played with when you it wasn't it wasn't about new plastic when you when US 60 year- olds grew up we never grew up with a yard full of plastic no we had maple trees that our grandpa built that we climbed and we jumped off and broke our arms we had Bor twine that was thrown in the garbage that we braided ropes and tried to tie up the dog and and so we have Christians that come to church and they can't worship God CU they don't know how they're making their minimum payment on their credit card tomorrow tomorrow M amen God help us here can I finish this quote he said I'm going to the hills and he said it's not exactly to hunt squirrels because well I like to hunt squirrels but I'm going there for a purpose for this purpose saying God I don't know which way to move and I don't want to miss you help me and you pray for me and I'll do and I will that too I'll pray for you and I hope by God's mercy that we'll meet every one of us in that better land in heaven and that we'll be coming here and what we are doing and we're coming here that we're not playing games he's talking about coming to church that we're not playing games that are we coming here to meet in a lodge or is it Christ that came until the church it's Christ that can't come until the church is perfectly right and he's waiting on us and I believe this was in' 65 he said I believe then we're at the End Amen and like I said this is an individual thing but it it will it should it should if if this message don't do nothing else just consider and think about before you buy thing that wasn't even on your mind to buy does you know I bought something the other day I was in the secondhand store and I bought a bell and Lan said well that'll just be something else for the girls to dust you know lean grew up with menites in Indiana and she went in their houses and they're almost straight wood their houses and they have absolutely nothing in their house it will actually freak you out when you go in their house and it will outo be because they have nothing in their house I don't even believe they have curtains I don't believe they did oh they did have curtains okay they have not it's a barest looking thing you ever the most cluttered room was the kitchen cuz it had a table and chairs in the living room there might be one wooden bench they don't believe in soft cushion chairs because that's making it easy on your life and they'll have a grandfather clock and that's it they don't believe in pictures they won't have nothing soft there'll be nothing in the yard but the maple tree and the pony tied in the pasture the dog running around you say well we're way beyond that are we our Prophet talked about it God talked about it said the borrower is the slave to the lender said oh no man nothing it's not something you hear very often says you know give your shirt to you know you know in James it talks about if somebody comes you with a need watch this I'm going to I'm going to balance it this way if somebody comes to you with a need like they you know we're living in a different world because of the Internet it's very different there's not a day goes by that somebody don't ask me for money but the Bible says that if you know if you said now I'll pray for you and go in peace and they were starving to death and you had now this is a key part and you had the ability to give them something eat that would be wrong but if you are operating on borrowed money you're already in sin so I tell people when they ask me for money now because my wife is very very wise and is the balance of the the way scale I say I I haven't got all my own bills paid yet this month and I might have to borrow money to pay them so sorry man see that's not that's not out of order that's just that's Bible see you you don't give God never well God will never ask you to give something that first he didn't give it to you first more and abundantly more than you could even ask or think like if what you give God is beyond what you could even spend amen you know I want I want and and I I have a lot more scriptures a lot more quotes and I want to just hit a thing late and we're we're doing really good it's just 11:00 you know I want to show you something farmers generally owe a lot of money and if you're borrowing money to make money like you know if you're a truck driver you got to have a truck to drive hello a semi so like that's your that's your job so you're going to buy a semi and then drive it to make money that's called livelihood that's that's a necessity that's that's not I'm not talking about that like a farmer if a farmer don't have a farm he's not a farmer I'm talking about the other stuff that's a clutter in your life amen and if we get rid of all the Clutter that that we're paying interest on I I want to just show you something example when I bought the farm that we started the House Church in right north of me Interest was 99.3% interest when I bought it and that was so cheap then no that was before Esther was born so that was before there was wheels and uh that was so cheap that I locked it in for 5 years terrible mistake yeah so cheap I locked it in for 5 years and you know when I made my first Farm payment I I'm just I'm I know I'm jarring you but and you don't you can just throw this in the thing I pray you don't say I was a waste of money coming to church this morning cuz I hope I give you enough scripture already for that but I made my first Farm credit payment and it was 33,000 and you wouldn't believe how I sweat to make that CU Esther wasn't born tells you how old my kids were and I paid less than 3,000 principal and when I got the Sleep the sheet and I seen that I almost vomited I did all that struggle to feed the devil I I'm talking about myself brother Dale I'm not I that's entirely up to you where you go with that you see what I mean and so there's times now I'm getting a little bit whiter around the ears there's times I say you know I don't need that struggle I like staying in the living room studying the message CU if there ain't a profit to it and a need why are we uhhuh 1 Timothy 63 and 10 if any mind teach you otherwise consist consist not to Wholesome words even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to Godliness 1 Timothy 6 3 and starting at four now he is proud knowing nothing but doth about questions and strife and words thereof cometh envy and strife railings and evil verse five disputings of men and corrupt minds and all these things the truth supposing that gain yeah yeah now now you can say I'm right out to lunch but this is the Bible and Paul wrote this but gain is godliness for such withdraw yourself so I I don't believe that that's just boring we're Way Beyond that we have the Mysteries this is is a mystery this is a mystery and if you don't believe it you don't even believe the word of God withdraw thyself but godliness with contentment is great gain and for we brought nothing into the world and it is certain that you ain't carrying nothing out having food and rign and let us therewith be content oh I don't like service is like today neither do I I had something a lot more happy to preach you know I had a minister from another country and he had listened to one of our CDs and he said brother Dale I'm not going to tell you who it is I'm not even going to tell you if you asked me brother Dale he said that should be preached in every message church but he said they'll never ask you because you're not popular and you didn't make the people people happy you didn't preach to people happy we only invite people that preach you happy if if we preach me happy then then I'm all excited the offering is way bigger that's completely God's see but are are like are we mature adults amen but Godly for we buy nothing into this world and is certain we're going to carry nothing out having food and rment there was be content but they that will be rich fall into Temptations and a snare onto many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown a man in destruction that's a fairly serious thing now I don't know for any of you said no but I I trap foxes with my brother Allan from a snowmobile and a snare does any everybody know what a snare is it's like a trap but you can't see it it's the smallest piece of wire there is and it's a cable and it's got a one-way slip thing and so when an animal goes in it it won't release but when it goes in it it never seen it I don't care if it was an eagle it never seen it that's what the definition of a snare it's invisible because it's put like in a fence or in a weeded area where looks like the surroundings but it's a trap unawares amen now we know there's no problem we already clarified that you know you need a house and a vehicle for the love of money is the root of all evil which some have converted after and they have AED from the faith and pierced themselves through with many Sorrows now we're not talking I don't believe believe that that like having a job and preparing and preparing for old age that's not the love of money that's just I mean you'd be foolishness to balance this out the Bible says a man that don't prepare or or Supply the needs of his family is worse than a fool an Infidel so I'm not talking about that I'm talking about being content to not stress out and putting your emphasis on God watch this here brother Brown said he said the move of God's spirit is not by the amount of money or this I love our Prophet or talent in the church the move of God's spirit Hol spirit is not based on the amount of money in the church or the amount of talent that people are that have that are in the church amen amen Romans 131 and two and then we're going to jump to 8 and six and I'll I'll tell you when we do let every soul be subject to the higher powers and therefore there is no power but god the powers that are ordained of God whosoever whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist it shall receive thems damnation so I'm showing you what's wrote right in God's word you might want to consider it don't matter to me what you do with it verse six for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are God's ministers attending continually upon this very thing in verse 7 render therefore to all their dues and tribute to them their dues and their Customs to customs and fear to whom fear and honor to whom is honor but verse eight is the one that I highlighted oh no man nothing oh no man anything but love one another for he that loveth another fulfill the law amen now we know that the prophet n mentioned some things about this he said now I'm just going to mention some quotes that he mentioned from that scripture he said now I was laying here and he said he came in he came into the service and he's preaching a different message and he said there's been many requests this week on what I said last Sunday's message so you know even the prophet dealt with things from people you know people are humans he said I believe I forgot to title last Sunday's message but it was something about paying your debts and he said you know now I'm reading no matter matter what you say it's misunderstood by many so I'm not trying to you can do whatever you want to your money makes no difference to brother Dale it's just something that God was stealing with me huh brother Dale's done those bill paying things where you get $33,000 Bill and you pay only 3,000 principal I kind of matured past those kind of operations he said you misunderstood many times not because they want to misunderstand it but because you simply misunderstand it he said now you know someone say shouldn't we buy a car and he said no it isn't that Jesus spoke in the Bible oh no man nothing he said that's lingering debts that you can pay pay them he said oh no man nothing doesn't mean he said you owe your rent you owe your phone bill and whatever more he said we owe these things and we pay them but no but an old lingering debt that you could pay and and be paying on pay it off see now don't go with anything hanging on you like that remember the time when I was sick he's talking about when he was sick he come out of the hospital he owed $2,000 and he used drugs from the store and he said I owed him about $300 or $400 for my drugs and he said he never even knew me and he said I went to the man and he said never refused to send me the drugs and he said he said now I owe you and he said I'm just still awful weak this is Brother Brown coming out and he said but I'm trying to go to work he said now if I can't pay you he said I just become a Christian and I said the first thing I pay to the man from the drugstore is my duty to God he said I owe him my ties and he said I want to pay him my ties first and I said then the next duty is I pay my debts and I said my father is really sickly and he's got about 10 of us children in the family and he said if I can't pay you at least now watch this he owed him $2400 and he was going to pay him 25 that would have been a long time clearing up the debt he said but if I can't pay you at least 25 cents I'll come by and tell you about it he said if I can't do it this time but now by the help of God I'll pay every bit of it off and that's what I mean and he said oh some Christians here in the church one time he said they went out and they got some work done on their car here and a man came back the man said I I'll pay you and he said I get paid on Saturday or something another and he never paid him and weeks after weeks rolled by and he never paid them and he never said a word and the man came to brother bam and asked me he said you see that reflects on the church he said it reflects against Christ amen and he said if you can't pay him tell them you know I can't pay you just right now but I'm a Christian and I'll just remember it's watch this now I want you to this may shock you cuz you probably never well I whatever he said this s Prophet said he said now remember I owe this and remember it's on God's books too you don't think God cares about you what you do with your money it's on God's books too and you know that you do and so that I'm trying to tell you for myself and all of us here together try to be ready for we know that we're getting near something very near something is going to take place and so we want to be ready when the coming of the Lord draws nigh and we want to be ready for that great hour wow I already told you I'm just going to highlight this so I can go through it fast here brother Brown's talking about his ministry and and and I I just want to read you uh I want to read you some of his things because it was shock you he said I was down a few months ago and he said we had a meeting and I was really discouraged in California and my meaning are you hanging on had failed terribly and I promise the Lord that if he ever failed me to pay the bills and he goes into Samson fford wh and Saul fell for popularity and balum fell for money he said when God quits paying the bills I quit preaching amen he don't mention that one time he mentions that repeatedly so you know anytime that people are out doing work for God they shouldn't ask other believers it's you know it's not God's will for a man of God to want to do God's work and beg for money that's not God's will a matter of fact I'll even rephrase it more than that it's not even God's will for me to ask better yet I'll even confin it even more it's not even my will God's will for the minister to tell you do you believe God's omnipotent do you believe he speaks to people that got the Holy Ghost do you believe that he can make the phone ring on both ends brother did Brother Brown say he works on both ends uhhuh are we mature Christians or not and see so all these things people like acting like in kindergarten you got more faith in rich countries than you do in Jehovah you see that's perfect balance amen what we need to do is just trust God and Obey just trust God and Obey and see God May control where you go by see watch this you know the Bible says when you go don't take an extra set of clothes with you don't prepare what you're going to sleep don't take no money with you but we take the credit card because you have more faith in that Visa than you do in God yeah maybe you didn't pray through Ono then amen I promise the Lord in my meetings that when my meetings got started he said they didn't financially support themselves I would never let them beg anyone that ever begs for money or who's going to give $50 or so forth he said that time will stop it they go what they're talking about if they ever take up pledges he said if you ever brother Brown never ever believe and take up who will pay pledges down the road for next month when we said I don't believe in that garbage because you're binding the people that then they got something else they got to think about for two months I wonder if I can meet the pledge that's not God's way amen y now Lord when you don't support me he said it's time for me to come back home God help us here here's this one where uh I said I said look a few years from now look in a few years from now and I will say it within the space of five years or maybe a little bit longer or maybe a little bit less your money won't be worth the paper it's rodon he said it won't be worth nothing and I'll just tell you something that's that's came true that's came true brother Brown was exactly right it ain't worth nothing I I showed you a few maybe it might have been a year or so ago I was showing you the difference of of inflation and how it works and if you Google the bank it'll talk about how it trick people to inflation but you know when my dad bought his farm before I was born he paid $1,200 for it today it would sell for 3 or 4 million that's inflation when I was in elementary school in grade two they would have hot dog day and the hot dog was a quarter a a thing of milk was a dime a DME that's called worthless we went to sale yesterday and Felix went down to the thing and he had 20 bucks and it took 20 bucks to buy a hamburger and some priz a small potato 20 bucks 25 what the prophet said was exactly the truth amen here he says this quote and I want to go into this and I want to I'm going to finish with this it's talking about when he met his wife he said it's not the robin the p on we mentioned this Wednesday night and we had a wonderful time if you miss Wednesday night service you're missing a lot he said it's not the robin that pecks on the outside of the Apple that hurts the Apple it's the worm on the inside that you can't see that kills it amen he said I guess you'd like to know how I met my my wife and his girl said and I want to go through this because he talks about some relationship uh things and he also talks about some money issues and I want to show you you how we and I I promise I'm going to close when we finish this one I have much more but we'll just move it back cuz it's it's we're coming up to time but he talks about when he met his first wife there and uh he thought she was super lovely very sweet character and he's talking about this I'm just paraphrasing I have this quote in front of me and he he said I went with her for a while and he said I come home and he said her father was uh working during the Depression I want to show you something here uh honey you got your phone divide uh 60032 into 600 I forgot to do that forgive me and he said his father her her father had a job during the Depression and he made 600 a month and he said I was working this for any of you that have any daughters that might get married in the future and he said I was working digging ditches this is brother brandham and he said I was making $32 a month it was 25 cents a day I think it was but it was or or maybe it was something different now I I actually don't have that right here and he said oh he said well I shouldn't go with her any longer cuz she's too pretty of a girl and I either need to make a commitment to her or let her go free how many times that go in okay 19 times you know I wonder I wonder if you know us dads if we had if if we were making uh I wonder if us dads were making $1,000 a week that ain't very much now but if we were making $1,000 a week it's easier to do the math and we had somebody come to want to marry our daughter for $50 a week we'd say yes you think brother [Laughter] Matt let's see what let's see how it panned out for the prophet he said well I thought that I shouldn't go with her any longer cuz I was taking up her time and she's a good girl and she and you know she's going to make somebody a good wife and I should let her go or ask her to marry me and he said I just couldn't get the nerve up and he said there's some really special stuff in here we need to understand cuz sometimes we believe something that ain't even real and he said so I guess how he said I I could never ask her cuz that would just be not possible so he said I wrote her a letter and he said I asked her in the letter to marry me and he said well now you know it wasn't just a Dear Miss will you will you have me he said it was a little bit mushier than that our Prophet was mushy whoa that's not spiritual that might just be your thought he said it was a little bit musier what you would call musier than that and I kind of talked to her and I remember the thought and I got something right and he and so uh he said so I worked up till the morning I worked at the public works and he said I got the nerve to put the mail letter in the mailbox it took him a few days after he wrote the letter to just get the nerve to mail it and he said it was on Monday morning I dropped it in the box and he said all day I thought about this letter and he said tonight I said oh no he said oh no he said he said I'll hear from her tonight and her mother will call me and rake me over the coast and I went on he said and it went night was all like that I was afraid of getting raked over the coast you know what God showing you this morning our Propet was a real person God uses real people and I was to meet her on Wednesday night to go to church and so I remember when I came towards Wednesday night he said I was just so nervous I didn't know what to do he said I thought what I'm going to do when I get there so I asked my mother I said you got to rely on your good old mother I said has hope called he said she said no did you get any mail he she said no said well maybe it got hung up in the mailbox and she didn't even get it out of the box yet and I thought oh something's going to happen here he said oh I went up and he said I drove up to her house on Wednesday night that's another good question for your brother Matt and he said rather than go in I blew the horn I would have went any man that don't want to come into the door knock to get my daughter and he sits out and like B his horn yeah just thank you sister joony I would have said you little squirt he blew the horn if that had been my wife I would have got a terrible tongue lashing when she got out there and she come out and said come in and he said I panicked he said Oh I thought oh no he said what am I going to say in there to his mother to her mother and I'm really going to get it I'm really going to get it he said are you ready to go and she said let's walk to church and so he said oh no he said I said oh okay and so they walked to church on Wednesday night and he said the minister looked or oh he went into the house too and he he seen his mother-in-law and she said hello Bill and I said hello how are you and he said I was so nervous so I thought something's going to happen you know how you feel when you're under a great strain amen I'm trying to show you that he was a human and you can even get under a strain by slavery we have other things that affect cuz we I'm going somewhere so we went out and we went to church now this is a Vindicated prophet and he is Vindicated and honestly I didn't hear one thing the preacher said wow now if we had any young people come to church and they were so affected by the relationship that they didn't hear me preach we would judge them we would you might as well just say yes because you would I'll say it for you amen getting too quiet he said honestly I never heard a thing that Pastor Davis said that night and he preached he just preached the way and I I I I didn't know what he was saying he said I was scared something was going to happen and I looked at her oh she was so pretty and she was going to tell me that this is all over and it's the end for you don't come and see me anymore more and stay away from home after tonight and so I had all fixed up what she was going to tell me see our Prophet was dreaming about things that was going to happen and he was see how I I'm showing you something by this that I know some of you are missing but our life choices affect how we worship God see things that are in our environment affects what's going on in church man and then they may not even be evil it's not evil like it's fine to get married but that's the same thing that happens with finances it can affect our we can be so sidetracked that it wouldn't matter if we preach Hellfire and brimstone or or Jesus walked in himself cuz our mind is somewhere else that's all I'm trying to say and he so after church was over and we started walking back home and he said oh it was pretty Moonlight and he said we're walking down the street and we went on and he said I looked at her and I thought oh I'm going to hate that this is the last night I'll ever be able to see her and all this and I and she uh and I said how are you doing tonight and she said just fine how are you and I thought now this is a prophet I I love this it might be killing you but I love it he said he says I thought hurry up lady tell me something i i before I faint don't get too close to home I walked a little farther and I said sure pretty night she said yep it is I thought well why don't you hurry up say something you know women can just keep you like that anyhow and you know under such suspicion and I walked on and I thought well she's getting pretty close to home I said uh did did did did you get a letter in the mail and she said uh that was all she said uh that was all she she didn't even say if she got it or not and he said uh did you get my letter and she said uh and I thought my oh my I certainly burn an energy there I said well I said did did did you did you read it and she said uh-huh and I said I said well what did you think of it she said it was all right and I said well my I said I now he he stuttered now he said did did did did did you did you did you read it all see he was looking for for an answer and she said yes and I said well what did you think and she said well it was okay and we got married and there it was and I don't know how we just got [Music] married and then he goes on and he he goes and he and I I want to show you something here he says I want to show you the strain that he was under now that's what I'm I'm not trying to change the subject but it's the strain that God don't want us under you you can live your life and you've got to buy all the things you need but it's the strain there and now there's some strains you can't help like there's things that happen that are like flat out accidents sister Joan's basement flooded sister you know sister Donna you know AC or stuff okay that's just that's called life okay but I mean you know strange that you choose to put yourself under we don't have to go under them amen and they affect your worship they affect how you go to church they affect how you worship they affect how you lose yourself with Christ and I said the next strain came when I was to ask her mother and daddy and he said well you know he he said apparently I uh he said it was apparent to do that and so I never would forget her dad Charley he said he was sitting right there that afternoon and her mother was very prissy sort of a woman a fine woman and she belonged to up in the ranks you know she was wealthy and Charlie was just a good old humble brother praise God for good old humble brothers and I thought well I'll ask him and I'll let him ask her and I thought could I get by with man a lot better than I could ever talk to her so one night I was leaving now he didn't do it then he one night I was leaving and hope said he said did you ask Dad yet and she he said no he said well well you ought to and he said why know I should but I'm not hope said I think it'll be okay so when I went out to leave that night he said see you later her dad said see you later Billy and I said uhuh Charlie he said I said could I talk to you just a bit and he would have said I said he come out and this is his English he's stuttering here and he said he came out and we walked on the front porch and he said I was sweating and shaking I said Charlie I want to ask you something he said oh you can have her Billy he said just go and be good to her he never did ask her and I said oh I love him to this day because of that you know I I'm showing you some things sometimes we don't have to hurt people or or you know put you know what I'm saying like we're all unique and if you know somebody's got strength just trying you know what I mean there there's a lesson to be learned in this it's not here for nothing just kind of we're all on the same side and I said oh Charlie I can't give her the living or the clothes and I can't buy her what you can buy her but he said I'll promise you this I'll be I'll love her with all my heart and I'll work till my hands bleed for living and I'll be true to her and I know as true to her as I know how to be and he put his arm around me and he was a German and he said his big hand over me and he said Billy I'd rather that you would have her be good to her than somebody that could give her a lot of money that's what I was getting to and would treat her mean sometimes is people in the world that we live in we put a lot of stake in money money it's just something that we're using but we shouldn't put our stake in it it's all going to burn it's all going to pass away and you know when we get to the ply Gates they're not going to ask how much money you had they God ain't going to rate us we're not going to sit around the throne based on how much we had in rsps or savings cter how many cars we drove you s to me but we're humans and it's hard to leave that own now you see what I mean they're not wrong I'm I'm not saying that you understand I I drive a nice car so I would be the first one sining and I have a Visa and it's got money on it amen but my plan even in the future is to change some things you know we have 50 pair of shoes there's people in many countries have none you know we went to El Salvador and they don't need three closets for one person you know Uganda I mean you can just I mean you can just name it most of the people there they're you know what I'm saying and and that don't make us like we do have a cool climate but I have 20 winter coats I don't wear any of them you know what I'm saying there's balance in this and and are are we the stewards that we should be for God's kingdom I just I just wonder I pray we are I pray we are this this message is not about money but I or not about uh changing your thing but see balum couldn't get away from even though God stopped them on the road with a donkey even though God whooped them like you would not believe would have actually killed them if the donkey hadn't stopped them killed them he went right back out because he loved the credit card he got sheep and goats and he never could do what Bao wanted him to do because it wasn't impossible amen God help us God help us I want to just finish I'm still on this quote is that all right I'm still uh and we're finishing soon he said we got married and we we started housekeeping and I wanted to show you I mentioned about uh having your house cluttered and and if yours is ours is too I can barely get to my chair without snorkeling through the plants but uh he said the only thing we had I'll tell you what we had he said we had a an old place where my rent cost me $4 a month $4 a month and I went to a little old place there and somebody give me an old-fashioned folding bed and you remember the oldfashioned folding beds they had straw mattresses and we had a little old table that I bought at Sears and robu that was when they were together that was way back and the chairs and I painted them and he said we had two rugs and they cost a quarter a piece and I went over to Websters and I bought he was a junk dealer and he said I bought a cooking stove and I gave him a dollar and something for it and I had to and I had to pay a dollar. 75 for Gat for grates to put in it and I got a nce box at the Public Service Company for 50s and one of them was in a swap and we went to keeping housekeeping now there ain't one of us sitting here that if we were honest with ourself would let our daughter go into that situation why because you think you're too good me too I I'm preaching to me too because I think my daughters would be too good too and Friends I'm still reading does everybody believe the prophet like is that okay like oh thank you brother Bernard I'm good brother matter whoever was said friends it was Paradise on Earth we had each other and we became a covenant in that time and I became a minister and was preaching and we loved one another and that's all we cared for I want to show you something see it was Simplicity that he could minister to God if our Prophet would have had a Visa card would have he been successful amen we don't know but he never watch this he said listen happiness does not consist of how much of the world's good you have or but how content you are with the portion that's a lot of to you that's right remember that's all we had and we were happy and lovely and I had a little church and they had built for me and I started preaching the group see sometimes we we think well times have changed but have they amen and What's happen is the Love of Money can come in and it can affect how we serve God not that it can it has or God would have told me to preach this today it's not it can it already has and there's people that you know you just you for you and your household you need to make sound decisions that you know I I I make a confession there's not been one time that I've come back from Africa that it didn't affect me for months I come back CU I'd go for breakfast and I'd say that's more than they make in a month or i' gas up my truck and I'd say well they couldn't spend that in a year uhhuh he talked about Billy Paul was being born and and they went to the Pentecostal meetings and I I'm closing this is the same quote he's he's given this for a reason and he went to the Pentecostal meeting and you know they were happy people and they had the Holy Ghost and they were dancing he never seen this before and he said I was counting my money and he was way away in another state I want you to know this he was he was following the biblical principle take not an extra coat with you an extra thing and he said I counted my money and I had $2.50 left and he said I wanted to stay over and he said I had just enough gas to buy and put in my car to get back to Indiana just enough gas he couldn't eat and he couldn't get a room but he still went there's not one of us sitting here that would have done that but that's why God worked through him and and see he wasn't in debt no he didn't have a credit card and he said I looked at he he talking about his trousers and you know you know that he slept in the cornfield that night and he said they invited me to breakfast but he said I wouldn't go to the church breakfast cuz I couldn't put nothing in the offering because I couldn't get back home and he says oh they were just so friendly and invited me and he said they were just so inviting and welcome me and he said it wasn't and I wasn't going to eat with him because I didn't have no money to put in but I didn't I didn't eat with them but they made me feel so welcome anyway he said they were the cream of the crop and he said I got to tell you something he came back home and he was telling his wife they were the cream of the crop and they screamed and shuttered and jumped and all this and they weren't ashamed of their religion and and so and so he was so inspired by God now watch this he had a job I'm showing you something I'm closing with this real soon but he had nothing nothing zero when he got home he was broke and he came home to his wife and he said I met the cream of the crop and they're not ashamed of their religion and he said they've invited me out and he said I'm going to quit my job and his wife went oh you're getting right and he said look I'm going to quit my job and start right out to preaching and she said well we haven't got any money she was related to Len and I said but how much money do we got that sounds like me and she said well you got $12 and the payment on the forge 12 bucks you see and he said well I'm going preaching for them and will you go with me and she said bless her heart she said I'll stick with you Billy I'll stick with you and I'll go with you I'm closing with that you know I I was showing you different things there and I I pray you got some of it but times haven't changed they were just making a living it's a bigger number but they were just surviving and brother Brown made hard decisions to serve God because he wasn't in a trap and of course he was called and dedicated and his wife was there you see you see how things are you think well you know well it's it's harder now we're that's it's always been hard you see what I mean you can ask any of these younger people here that started out was it easy when you got married sister Don sister Jan or brother no it was always hard it'll always be hard but your good decisions with God in the center just like a marriage it takes three with God in the center of your finan say what would God do what would God do do you know the young people need to hear things like this we didn't grow up in a world of restaurants you maybe had Granny's Kitchen or something I remember when fast food restaurants come out they had a beginning and they will actually have it in you know I remember when we went on family trips we took a loaf of bread a pound of baloney and the mustard can and we lived but it's about bondage and stress you make choices if you bind yourself and Satan SS back and laughs Satan sits back and laugh now I'm not trying to put you uh God just God helped us God help me be good stewards of what God give us and you know there's things we have to have let's stand musicians can come God just God help us you know I I believe and I know for a fact whether you believe it or not I'm I feel sorry for you but Satan's pulled the wool over our eyes and the World Bank has pulled our wool over our eyes and inflation and and you know everything's going to end it's just changed for me greatly because I don't know I must be getting younger in one way but you know when you get older it just changes your environment you know my brother called me and I maybe mentioned this Wednesday night there was a man that died in metya and he was worth he he just lived in a common house he' never get married and that and he bought a bunch of land and when he was younger and none of this matters but you know when you die you're dead it don't matter and my brother Paul said he said the government won't have no trouble meeting their bills this week cuz the guy was worth like 40 million he had hundreds and hundreds of he was telling me Parcels of land that he bought 400 acres for $100 an acre they'll sell it now for 25,000 an acre but where will the money go he's still dead like does it don't even you know what I mean and we got to go back to the scripture that says lay up your Treasures your Treasures are your family the Eternal beings in your environment lay up your Treasures where moth and rust won't up now there's things we have to have I we will freeze to death if you don't have a warm house but just in balance in Balance amen and and and I also I I I I believe God wants to tell you this if you don't have it don't ever let a minister tell you or put pressure on you to give something that you don't have to give that's not God's way that's not God's way you need to know those things amen amen amen God help us you know if we're simpler we can serve him Freer and better amen amen there's things I did in my life you know I can remember and I'm I'm closing I'm trying to wind down I can remember when I spend in my bunker my yard for cattle I came that winter I said oh man if I was making that choice again I'd have that money back in the bank CU I could never pick it up again it was gone forever you know me before you make hard decision don't call Brother Dale I won't know what to do either but just think them through what would God do how will you feel about I have a good thing you know my grandpa and my mother's side used to say had a partnership with his son Larry and he'd anything that he was making a deal with he'd say well I have to talk to Larry but I tell people I say I have to sleep on it I have to pray or sleep on it and what I feel like in the morning when I wake up if I toss and turned all night I don't need whatever I toss and turned over I value the night's sleep a lot better than the tossing and turning amen that's what we're talking about amen God help us God help I hope that spoke to somebody a simpler life who has the most isn't who wins amen it's who is got the simple life that can heal the still small voice of Jehovah speaking in the cave amen we're getting so tied up with just Rat Race just running everywhere and and it and I mean sometimes you have seasons that you go through but but then you have to amen amen God help us amen we are in the season of the coming of the Lord the time is all around us and the word is been rest you can take away the promise what we've been waiting for we are in the season of the coming of the Lord oh we are in the [Music] seas are all around us and you can take away theise we are in the of theing we are in [Music] the God bless
