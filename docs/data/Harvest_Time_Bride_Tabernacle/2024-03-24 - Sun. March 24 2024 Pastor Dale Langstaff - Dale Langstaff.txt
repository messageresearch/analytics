having our part of our small choir we just love to have Sister Anne and sister Alice next time but they were at our place and so we had a little singspiration last night we had a wonderful time and you could you could tell that your kids came from Heaven because they were just like angels and and that that's actually the truth amen hallelujah just uh just uh want to minister on a a thought here this morning and I'm not sure that I will I will I will finish I'll just uh watch the clock and maybe the clock or God one or the other will tell me if I finish or not but let's turn to Matthew 24:14 and it I would encourage you to to read Matthew 24 I listened and read it many many times and this week I know you have two but Matthew 24 talks about everything in the end times everything preparing for going home in a Rapture and and everything how it will be multiple multiple Parables and Matthew 24 is a long a long verse but I always want to touch on this one verse and I want to go into a a thought that I believe God laid on our heart and and just uh just uh that just came to me just remember next Sunday brother Kyle will be with us and we just look forward to Fantastic fellowship with them and the whole weekend also I put up a couple posters of camper different camps out just under the speaker and I would encourage everybody to to do all you can to be with your brothers and sisters amen let's enjoy each other here before we get there amen it's uh it's not just amen it's a great body worldwide bride amen and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then the end shall come Lord Jesus we pray that you would just uh be with your word this morning and may you just just move the speaker out of the way and even move the hearer out of the way Lord God and may they hear you may we hear you and speak you this morning we pray and we give you the glory for it in your name amen amen I want to preach on a topic uh that you may have your seats that brother Brown mentioned on many times the he preached on it the Revelation that was given to me and the great the angel and and his commission the angel explaining his commission and and uh but I want to show you that you know when we get into the end time there will be no excuses there will absolutely be no excuses so we see in this scripture that we can't go home until all the nations have heard this truth this message that we believe this message of Christ amen and never in a generation before has it been possible through technology amen and even places where you can't go as a human being there is the word of God sent through the waves amen and even what uh you know brother Brown said even with TV he said God meant it for good and Satan used it for evil and that's with all technology but there is a good side to it and it will spread the word of God and I want to look into the signs of the times and Wednesday night we preached on the the five raptures that have happened in the Bible one hasn't happened yet one will happen that's us us going home but the four raptures that have happened amen and so this is not a new thing that's happened it's happened four other times and we're going to be the fifth time to go in a Rapture and that will be Grace amen and so we praise God for that but we see that you know the Bible says that no man knows the time or the hour but we'll know the season and so we wonder how is God showing this and we know this by Israel and the Fig Tree and she'll bring forth her bud and and all these things and we know that Israel maybe I'll just read that this thought what the prophet said you know Israel became a nation in 46 on Wednesday night I think I said 48 and I was off amen forgive me but uh Israel became a nation in 46 and people that were born then are are are still alive but but they're this generation won't pass away so we're at the end times amen as in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah and we so we have arrived in many many areas you know it talks about wars and rumors of wars but the time is not yet now we know that we got lots of Wars but the time ain't yet but we do have Sodom and Gomorrah and we do have the generation of Israel the generation that was born in the time of Israel are going to be soon be a generation so we see that and here brother Bram said this comment so I looked up in the message I looked up God's first Bible amen and uh and I looked up that and then I I'm going to and I looked up another one I said before God does anything and and brother Bram in uh God's first Bible he mentioned that 51 times in the message and before God does anything he mentions that eight times and I want to read just short clips to lay a foundation of the Prophet setting our expectations you know God's coming for those that are watching for him now in Matthew 24 later in the chapter it talks about if the good man knew when the thief was going to come by his house he would have been prepared for him and it finishes that Parable by watch there far because he comes when you do not expect him amen and we are are trapped in human bodies and and even though you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are still plagued by this uh by this Badger skin of Flesh and we just in our Natural Body we're a Triune being and our Natural Body we have always been taught that it'll never happen to me it it will happen to everybody else but but not me it won't be me that gets sick or it won't be me that it won't be me that has a bad marriage or it won't be me that am man and it won't be me that the Rapture happens in my lifetime but I believe it will be me amen I totally believe it'll be me I don't just believe it'll be me I believe it'll be us that'll happen our re in our in our generation so let's look at in the time the first Bible God wrote and I'm just going to go through these five this is this this first one I'm going to read it's actually reversed it's a 65128 quote so it's rap before God took our Prophet but the first Bible he ever was wrote he wrote in the skies the next uh you know that was in God's provided way of worship the next one is God's first Bible he wrote In The Sky the zoic the Stars the it started off and runs off in every age that's the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom so here we're seeing that God's talking to us in the stars and in the skies in every age amen let's just this just this the lay of foundation just let me slow down and read this notice on this that Christ God wrote three Bibles and the first Bible was wrote in thegu here's another paragraph says always yes sir God provides it and if you'll just watch nature and there's the first Bible watching nature and if you'll notice and you'll never miss it Miss God if you'll just watch nature next quote but let me tell you that there was the first Bible I'm choking to death and that was ever written and it was in the skies and the next quote and the first Bible was written in the skies and Men looked up knowing god was above the next quote he said my first Bible was nature and I learned God through nature that's demonology and we're just we're just finishing this here and God wrote three Bibles one was the zoic one was the pyramids and one was on paper I remember your dad preaching that brother mine it's just as clear as day and and he preached on the pyramids CU he had been there and just like it was yesterday amen I thought of that when I was studying it and let's just look into this next quote here where we looked at and brother Brown says this eight times he said it more times if you if when you search the message if you put less words in you'll get a lot higher number but I want a specific thought before God does anything brother man mentions that eight times and when I was looking for this I was not looking for what I'm going to preach on but two of the eight times he mentions it brother Brown mentions his commission and I'm going to use that commission to lay a foundation and and uh before we actually get to our final thought if God permits us today or next time here just mentioning the short quotes real quick here and the angel came to my commission he said she said now you know before God does anything in the earth he always declares it in the heaven and then on Earth he said the next one he said they watch the Stars before God does anything on Earth and he shows a sign in the heaven before he does it on Earth before he sends judgment before he sends he sent an angel and give a me gives a message and he did that in the days of Noah and here he is in this days before Jesus and I believe he's here now before the second coming now we're getting to where we want to go do you believe him my friends let's go to the next one where he's King of the Jews and these men they waited on one true God and they worship him in the light in this the sacred fire and they would get around these fires and wait on God and many of them had observations and something like that here today and they would go to these places way up in the mountains and they would watch every move of the stars and they claimed that before God does anything on Earth he always shows it in the heavens first and they right that's what your Prophet said always God shows it in the heavens first now if he's a same yesterday today and forever is it possible is it possible he always shows the signs in heaven first since then he did since then then did he ever do anything that he didn't show in the heaven sign first I think of it in every age you wish to God always show does show signs in the heavens first before he does anything on Earth comes from a supernatural drops into nature and it's made manifested in watch this now there's key words here there's here for a reason in every age even though you don't believe it's going to happen in our time in every age and in every time and so this time is no different uhoh wait a minute now oh no you know we're living in a technical age and you know we have a message and you know we're you know uh we're just going to go on and yes we are and and and I know brother BR said plant your potatoes and I'm planting them thinking I won't Harvest them and and uh here here let let me just finish this and before God does anything on Earth I'm still reading these eight quotes he declares it in the heavens that's a revelation God give to me before God does anything usually on Earth he usually speaks it out in the heavens first did you ever notice that he always speaks in the heavens first and The Supernaturals always manifests itself and then it comes down and to the people so we laid a good foundation here to say that if God's ever going to do something great again and take a bride home in a Rapture the foolish virgin will never be able to say I didn't know first off that can't happen until this word's been preached in all the world but but even God even though God called the five-fold ministry which he trusts 100% the true five-fold Ministry God never even left it totally to them because he would even show it in nature and show it in the heavens now of course we know the most important things the word of God and God will always have a true Minister on Earth I'm not taking away from that one Speck amen but we see here that the time is at hands and you know we look at you know we mentioned about Israel it's been 76 years since is Israel became a nation and that generation won't pass away and the Bible says that the the the our promise is three score and 10 in Psalms 910 now you know I you know when I study I I find stuff I'm not even looking for Jared this will give you great hope I there for a while I thought Jared was the oldest man that lived in the Bible but sorry you're second but that's still pretty good you got 962 years so if you live just 10% of that you'll be 96 and a half so you know you really want to lay a foundation for all that's coming up your way but we see that even what the bible promises us that in this generation won't pass away 76 years and we know that Sodom has arrived everybody everybody agree with it sodom's arrived okay so now now we still don't know the day but let's read this scripture so we we get a strong Foundation pthew 24 here in 32 and 35 now learn the Fig Tree of the par the learn the parable of the Fig Tree when it's branches are yet tender and put it forth its leaves now you know the summer is nigh and so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near now you know I got in trouble before for other people thinking that I was preaching the raptures near now this is in Matthew 24 I mean they thought it in Matthew 24 the Rapture was near for goodness sake if you don't think brother Dell should say it's near what would I preach on woo Hallelujah even even at the doors in verse 34 and verily I say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled and Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away Hallelujah let's just look at you know I want to read just one thing before yeah we're done with the scripture I want want to read a a quote here um before we get into brother braham's commission you know brother Braham said we're living in a unique age and our message is different than it's ever been before because we have the full word of God and our message is not like any other religion because we have the truth we have Christ himself we don't just have a church name we just don't have a Minister's name we have Jehovah amen and so he said this age is different than it's ever been before and he said when a man's filled with the Holy Ghost and he talks about his spiritual vitamins think spiritual with me for for a minute now he said in every other age he said it was there was always a power and he said but the spirit the Holy Spirit has more power and it will lift You Higher and we can go higher and see more and believe more than ever before like Christ see this age is different and brother Brown even brother Brown's message was progressive revelation until God took him home and brother Brown was you know brother Brown was showing up or God was sorry was showing brother Brown more and more and more and more and and brother Brown and we're going to read it in the quote here when the seals were open he said the Bible's a brand new book to me because he was seeing Jesus become more clear and the veil was becoming thinner and and disappearing in front of them but he said and other ages they were powered by automo Automobiles and horse and buggy and even airplanes but he said we're living in an astronaut age and he said it's called The Eagle age and in the Bible God calls the eagle age His prophets and we recognize in the Bible that we'll find in Malachi 4 that he promises in our day don't see you might not want to believe the me uh like how could you believe that the Rapture ain't now or that we're not in the last day but you believe the message but the message ain't coming till the last day I always like reverse math to see if I'm right now the the Bible says that this this this wonderful message that you believe we only get it at the end but we don't believe the ends here well you believe another message is going to come no you don't believe that it ain't going to come I'll tell you what there's nothing that's better than than Christ himself and so he said uh we're in an astronut age and he said so we're the eagle age and he said we recognize sorry and he Likens His prophets to Eagles but he's the great Jehovah eagle and he's able to achieve this he's able to achieve this to himself in a bride wow he makes this so personal it's just beautiful and he's going to in this last day be able to get a bride and with the ministry that's exactly so like a man and wife become one Jehovah gets his bride to him and lives with his bride as wife amen this is in uh the countdown in 64 he's talking about this but watch this and he said you believe on me the works that I do shall you do also and this also but as in the last days but it shall also be fulfilled Phil Jesus said that it would take place that as in the days of Sodom so shall be the coming of the son of man and but we're living in an astronaut age and he said you see the horse rider in the automobile and the airplanes T that he said we go higher than them but they all had a source of power but you have a source of power too he said see all these ages even the airplanes will get caught up in the clouds and they'll hear the air pockets and you know you'll be in an airplane it'll drop and and all these things and they're affected by denomination and Creeds and thoughts of men but we move above that we move into the Heavenly where Jehovah himself's there and he said so we have to have something that's powering us too Hallelujah and he said when we're in that age he said we've get the achievement of the promise in the last age according to Mal Mali 4 and he said it's only him he's talking about the airplanes and the automobiles all wrecking up he watch how he says this too he saidou know the planes are all wrecking up and fussing in the clouds and deciding what kind of clothes they should wear and all this stuff and Creeds and that of men but he said he's keeping us moving until we go beyond any reasoning any reason he said God actually not goes beyond any Tre Creeds or boundaries or thoughts of men and the and Beyond you know people people saying that God's not the same yesterday today and forever amen search the scriptures for in them you shall find eternal life for they testify but watch this he said the ministry what does it do the astronaut sees the planes and everything to date and so does the spiritual astronaut it goes beyond the clouds of the Creeds and the chatter that everybody watch this he said well you what watch this is how Satan deals and we're going to get into this sumon brother braham's Commission and he said watch watch how Satan's telling somebody that wants to be an astronaut so well you can't do that nobody will cooperate with you this a direct quote I'm reading it he said you can't do this he said you can't do that but did you ever notice that he is an astronaut and he goes beyond all those disbelief amen and the astronaut he he said so here I'm I'm closing this this this thought here he says the airplanes and that they're all controlled by a radar but he said you're controlled by a radar too amen that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and that's the anchor holes and that's thus sayith the Lord amen oh it's it's beautiful church when you come under thus sayith the Lord the control towers and God will achieve just exactly what he wants when you go into the heavenlies amen into the astronaut so we look into brother baham and and I'm going to slow down on this because I want to lay this down and then we're going to get into what God's doing today but I want to show you the struggle that brother Braham had and I want to mention something that I mentioned before I mentioned it last week and I've mentioned it many times and it's it's it's Bible and its message but it's not message everywhere the message is different in different places because of people people Amen brother brandham was being it's how he says it he he didn't understand his ministry and he was being plagued I'm I'm just going to paraphrase this this is in a 60210 morning message it's a revelation that was given to me and I ran into this when I was searching before God does anything and out of the eight quotes he mentions this two times and he's talking about before God does anything and he shows his thing and this is this is worth saying we need to understand this perfectly it'll help us he said You know here he had he had got converted and he joined the Baptist Church and he' started preaching and had a Revival and you know the story so I can just go fast in the beginning but when he was baptizing on the uh the river you know the voice came over him and before this time brother Brown was having a lot of visions and it scared him it scared him to death he didn't understand it and he says here right here and these are open for anyone to see this I you can have my papers or or find it yourself he said the girl that I married later she said she took the picture of the pillar of Fire or the dove that came down on him and he said he was afraid and you know it mentions here he says as John the Baptist forun the first coming to Christ message you will forerun the second coming of Christ now I want to ask you a question just to lay a foundation now if brother bram's message was going to forerun the second coming of Christ it kind of Don't It Make logic sense that it would be in that generation or very close to that generation cuz like if it was 500 years down the road he could have picked another brother Brandon you see what I mean that's also a Vindication of where we're at TimeWise amen it's good to recognize where we're at and he said this this uh light appeared on you know we know the pillar fire and it was in all the newspapers and all this stuff and he said when these Visions came he said I guess I would see thousands of them he said I was afraid to tell people brother this is right in the beginning when God's starting to deal with our prophet he said I was afraid to tell people and here he said he said 'I want to say something first he said here when the uh how many here are Spirit-filled and he asked you to raise your hand and he said now I'll tell you that you'll understand surely this is a strange thing to say about this and and I I really want to slow down to to catch what the prophet's trying to say here but he went to a carnival he went to a carnival and there was a young lady there in a tent and she was a fortunate tell her she read your palms and she said my mom I'm just paraphrasing but it's right here in front of me he said my mom always told me that for tellers were were spiritualists and they were of the devil and she's right so he agrees with this mom and this little fortune teller lady was 16 or 17 17 or 18 years old should you say there about and I walked over to her and she said did you know that you're born under a sign and it scared me and I said I don't want nothing to do with that and walked away now we're going somewhere with this this is this is not just reading a quote and he later became the game warden and uh you know and he said and he mentions this exactly this part exactly twice and when the angel came to him in his commission he said one day I was going on the bus and he said there was a great crowd and I had to stand up and I felt a strange feeling and I was always s sensitive to spirits and especially when I would meet one of those people meaning a fortune teller and I would feel real funny and I began to feel that and I looked around and there was a strong woman looking at me and she said I'd like to speak to you now brother Brown was a shy person am man there's nothing wrong with being shy and one day and I'm just skipping a paragraph here he talks about woman he said and he said I was taking off my gun belt got oh sorry one day when I started to take my own life the gun oh the gun one oh God was taking care of his gift sorry forgive me just like when God was taking care of Moses when Moses tried to run away from it and so the back to the woman he said so this woman I said what would you want and she said sir did you know that you're born under a sign and quickly it scared me and I said I don't want nothing to do about this I don't want nothing to know nothing about it and she said haven't you never talked to preachers I say let's read that sign again haven't you never talked to any preachers brother Brown's going to say something really going to knock your socks off here I said I have no use for them that's not it he said I don't go around any anywhere any of that that stuff he said I don't want to hurt your feelings but I don't want to hear anything that you have to say now he's talking about the uh fortune teller person and she said sir that's not a gentleman and I turned to her again brother Brown saying and I said how did you know that and she said brother bram's asking how do you know I was born under a sign she said well when you came on the bus I seen it now she's a devil I'll just jump ahead to brother Brown brother Brown said all the religious people in his life thought he was the devil and all the devils in his life knew he was God do you know when we started our church I got letters from believers mailed to me that said you were the achievement of the devil I have them in my death store I have them in my death store now now now and I'm not bringing myself to brother brown but I just want you to see brother Brown plainly says what I just told you here so all the minister in his life said he had a devil but the Devil Himself recognize God Amen wow and so she turned and she went when I got when he got on the bus she said uh I work at the White House she said and I'm on my way to Chicago to my son who's a minister she said and I'm an astronomer now you see you wonder where I'm reading this quote it's because we're talking about the heavenlies okay I'm I'm really I'm really having lost my mind we're going somewhere with this and she said did you know who when God does anything first thing he does he declares it in the heavens now this is part of brother Brown's commission but we have another thing that's going to happen in our life that's a Rapture and before he declares it he declares it before he declares it on Earth and I said I don't know nothing about this and I turned around again and it kindly made me feel bad because there were so many people on the bus and and it and it it and me being the officer because see now he was dressed in his game warden uh uniform and it and you know he here he's almost being rude and so I thought that it was a gentleman like so she called me and kept calling me and I turned around again I said what do you got to do with me now now now let me just say this again brother Bram didn't understand none of this but but by us trying to understand it it'll help us and she said this this this fortune teller she said when Jesus Christ was born he was born and man came from the East he was born under a sign and that was a wise man I said I have no idea about that and she said well there was astronomers when Jesus was born that watched the heavens now this is the devil talking to brother Brown you understand where we going this ain't the ministers wow and before God does anything on Earth he declares that in the heavens and she said I I said but I don't know nothing about it and she said but when God gives a gift he declares it in heaven and I said but I still don't know nothing about it and she said you were born under a sign and she said if I tell you when you were born do you believe it now we don't think God can do things in our life you know you know the Bible says what is it in Hebrews 11 or something it talks about all the works that the mighty man of God did and that was before the Holy Ghost was given you know the only reason if you don't feel like you have something moving in your life it's because you don't have faith you don't believe because God's doing more than you can even comprehend if you just if you just take the scales off your eyes and look he's everywhere he's he's everywhere amen hallelujah and I said lady you can't read my mind and I don't believe you can do it and she said you were born on April 6th 1909 at 5:00 a.m. in the morning and she said that's when a certain star said Cross or something like that in the atmosphere wow now don't you think if Satan could do that well of course God Amen we we we got to stop insulting our heavenly father amen amen it's not our power but he's ultimate power amen this is beautiful here so she tells her exactly and I said I don't know nothing about it and I could care less this is Brother BR so she said well you may pass it by but said if you would respect it it would shake the world and I said tell this young sailor here he's talking about the person when he was born and she Saidi can't do that I said so then I was almost to my place where I was going to get off the bus and my ignation all came up and my face was all red and I was shaking and I was scared and I was glad to get off the bus see what I'm trying to show you is brother brandham didn't understand how God moved and sometimes in our natural being I'm not saying that we're ignorant but I mean in our natural being you think you got a associat in the in the the you know in your surroundings in the ranks of the message and that and and and we do and there and there's good ones you're sitting here this morning and and I'm not trying to say we're the only ones because that's that's a million miles from the truth but there's ones also sitting there amen and and brother B clearly says this and so we have to be we just have to understand that because it will be a Warfare for us and we'll think that we're the wrong ones amen and so later on I became a minister brother Bram says I became a minister and all these Visions they kept coming many times and then my Baptist Brethren this is where we going you got to catch this my Baptist Brethren they told me when you meet in this conference this Baptist conference like this we'll explain it I'll explain it to them and they said to me Billy don't listen to this move of God don't listen to this in your life that's of the devil now I I'm going to and if this offends you I hope this don't offend you but I had the exact same thing tell to me when we started the church and there was one person in brother Brown's life that supported his ministry one person and that was his wife and do you know if brother brandom would have listened to his wife it would have been easier on God and I mentioned this last last week and I'm going to read you the exact quote do you know brother bram's wife said Don't listen to the ministers and because brother brandham never listened to the spiritual counsel of his wife God literally had to send a body angel in the room with them I know you're struggling to believe that but I'm going to read it for you he said ' that's of the devil and the devil's trying to get at you and oh my that would just make me shake and it scared me and I didn't want nothing to do with that devil we're almost aw I'm going to read the other quote and he said so I came home and I was Tak he was at work and he said I came home from work and I was around the house and we had just a small house and I was taking off my gun belt and I was getting ready for lunch and I was going back to turned some fish loose in the conservation and my wife had dinner ready and there was a brother of the brother that played the piano in the church that wanted brother Bram to go somewhere with them and and uh I went around the house and suddenly here it came again see brother Brown had been listening to the preachers and and I'm not knocking pre I'm just I'm just saying I'm just trying to just get to understand how God moves and here I came again and I was with my wife and and she he he says in this other one he saysi almost fainted and the brother ran up to grab me and his wife brought a picture of water to throw in his face this was real this you getting the picture and he said I told my wife I said go in and call the office and tell them that I won't be working this afternoon and I don't know when I'll be back to work I said honey I can't go through the this I'm a sleep and he said if them Brethren are right meaning the ministers if they're right and those Brethren are right those ministers the devil's trying to take my life and I'm a minister a pastor now in the Tabernacle and when the devil's after me I got to get rid of it and so I'm never preaching again amen let's just stop there and I want to read just a short one on the other quote in this Commission now now I I hope you all understand how God moves I wasn't even looking for this I haven't even got to my message I'm going to preach on the heavens but when I was looking for Heavenly quotes God showed me this this is in how the angel came to me and his commission this other one is the revelations and so I was seeing the movement of V visions and this is just a couple paragraphs but I want you to catch how God was working through brother Brown's wife cuz I mean it's hard to believe me even though I'm telling you the truth he said and all these things would happen and when a little bit later on he said it kept bothering me and so much that nobody was telling me everybody was telling me it was wrong and I took off my old stom I went off to my old stomping grounds sorry yep up here to pray through for a matter praying that he'd come and it was and I was the game War in Indiana and there was a brother of the pianoist I I I just I've studied this so much I saying it by memory and he wanted them to go with them that afternoon and he said I can't go I got to go up to the forestry and so I was coming around my house and I was taking off my gun belt and things this a different quote but it's the same and I was rolling up my sleeves and we lived in a little two room house and I was going to wash and I was ready for my meal and I was washing I was just walking around the side of the house and under the baked maple tree and something went swoosh and just almost would passed out and I looked and I know it was that thing again and I stepped I stepped on those steps and he jumped out of the car that this other brother jumped out of the car and he said he said he ran away he said Billy are you're fainting now when you start fainting it's it's something more than just made up he said and I said no sir and he said well what's the matter Billy and I said I don't know I said I just go ahead brother he said I can't go with you just go ahead and he said that's all right thank you and he said my wife came out and brought a picture of water and said honey what's the matter I said nothing sweetheart and so she said she said come on in dinner's ready and she put her arm around me and tried to bring me in I said honey I'm going to tell you something you call them tell them I won't be in this afternoon and I said media Medi medy mey sweetheart I said I know my heart that I love Jesus Christ and I know that it passed from Death unto life but I don't want this devil that would have anything to do with me and I said I can't go on like this I'm a prisoner and I said all this time it kept happening and things in the visions and whatever and I said I don't know what these Visions are and I don't I didn't call it a vision I said I called them a trance and he said I don't know what this is honey and he mentions you know brother braham's English he he mentions I four times he said I don't want to be fooling with this and he said they watch this and they tell me I had some they in my life and they tell me it's the devil and I love the Lord Jesus and and here is paragraph 141 and this is in how the angel came and told me my commission and she said media said oh she said Billy you ought and listened to what those people tell you God speaking through his wife and because he wouldn't listen to his wife he had to put together a being an angel a man to talk to brother brown man but I said honey paragraph 142 and I said but honey look at those other preachers I said I don't want it I said I'm going to my place in the woods and I got this is hilarious this this will really make you chuckle he said I got $15 and that'll take care of you and Little Billy for quite a while that was a different world and you got enough money it'll take care of you and Billy to live on for quite a while and you call them up and tell them that I'll maybe be in tomorrow or I may never be back but if I don't come back in the next 5 days tell them to hire somebody else in my place and I said media I'll never come back out of that Woods until God promises not to speak to me and give me these transes ever again amen so can God speak through your wife if she's got the Holy Ghost it can be directly from the Throne of God Amen let's look in Luke before we get into our our thought here Luke 21:25 and 27 and there's shall be signs in the heavens and the moons and the stars and upon the Earth and distress and Nations and Perle and the Seas and waves and roaring and man's heart shall be failing for fear and for looking after those things which are coming upon the earth and the powers in heaven shall be shaken and verse 27 and then shall they see the son of man coming with power and great Glory Hallelujah we we see that God is going to speak Even in our day through the heavenlies man I just want to if you'll let me go back to the other quote and and and just forgive me for a bit I'd like to finish this where we were back to the other quote I just I just went to the other quote because brother Brown hadn't mentioned what his wife had said in the other message and so he went to the little cabin and and he said I prayed till 2:00 in the morning and he sat down and he said I was crying and and and he said the Lord let me let I said Lord don't let this ever happen to me again he's he's wanting God to take the gift off his life and he said Lord I love you and you're my savior and he said let no evil can take uh this over he said help me Lord he here he's praying and asking God to to get rid of what God give him he said I want to have nothing to do with the devil and I love you Jesus and I want to serve you and he said just then a light came on on the floor and he said I looked at the light and he said it began to spread out and I looked up above and here was a light this light was Milling around and he said it was kind of yellowish green and Amber and oh I pray to God I'll live to see that amen and with my natural eyes and the light was growing wider and wider and I heard some walk I heard some walking someone walking and they come walking up to the side of me right like my side came walking like a man and he had a white garment on and bare feet and kind of a dark complex hair coming down and he was a huge man that makes me feel a little better with great big arms and folded like this and he started walking to me and I was so scared I was biting my fingernails in my fingers and I thought I'd went to sleep you recognize why God had to send him an angel cuz you didn't listen to a holy ghost filled wife amen ver paragraph 14 I I I'm trying to hurry it's bear with me I'm sorry and now he said you might think that you would this would make you laugh but he said if you know you know I I think of this when people want to see the move of God you know if you're in the move of God and you're not in the right Spirit you'd be scared to death he said You' think this might make you laugh than that but he said if you stand there one place you'll feel the same way he said that was no vision he's talking about the angel the man he said surely I know it wasn't a vision he said it was no vision that was a man that was there and he said he was just the same as I am here right now and he was looking at me and he said he was getting he he kept getting back a hold of my chair and I was looking back and he looked around right down at me and he said don't fear and I said as soon as he said that I knew that it was the same voice that had spoken to me as a little boy and he said I I had never seen him before but I recognized his voice and it was a deep and he said Don't Fear again he said I've been sent from God to tell you your peculiar birth and life and he said now no one understood me he said my ministering Brothers I needed to finish this please under forgive me he said my ministering Brothers didn't understand me my father didn't understand me my mother didn't understand me and I never understood myself he said ' I didn't want to be different I don't want I wanted to be like someone else but you can only do what God makes you and he's the Potter and we're the clay and he said so I listened to him and he said now this was all indicated that you were born and to pray for for sick people and I said well I don't know nothing about praying for sick people I'm just a local Baptist minister sir and I looked at him again and he seemed very kind and seemed like the fear began to leave me and I said sir I'm uneducated and I could not do such a thing this sounds like Moses I could not do such a thing as you have ask and you have told me that I will do here here's brother Brown saying I'm not qualified and because he had just said that you'll go in all the world and you'll pray for kings and Patriarchs and and all these big people and and I never re and here brother Brown saying he said now I he well let me finish and he said how could I do that when I just have a grammar school education and this is going to shock you God was dealing with his life then and he said I had never received the Holy Ghost yet wow that's paragraph 15 on my angel's commission and these things were strange to me and I knew nothing about them then and I looked up again to speak to him and I said sir I could not do it and he said as Moses was sent two gifts to prove that he was Vindicated to the people he said you will be given two gifts and he talked about his science and his hands and he said now you'll be given to take your hands and Del lay on the people and he said I don't think you're going to he said you don't need to think of what you're going to say it'll just call what they have and you just be real reverent and he said I it'll come to pass that you'll know the very secrets of the people's heart and he said then they won't believe the first sign they'll believe the second sign and it'll come to pass that if you'll be sincere that this will get greater and greater and greater and so it was to me brother Brown said and I said sir because that then I'm I'm among my brethren and I see these visions and these Minister Brothers tell me that it's of the devil what you're doing in your life is of the devil buying this church was of the devil and I'm here that God will never let that happen to me again and quickly he walked in front of me me and asked me to stand up and I stood up and he said to me knowest thou not the scriptures I said well these other ministers doesn't know doesn't know doesn't agree with this and he said if this if this is what God would why would they have why wouldn't they have had it and he said this day is he said it is a day now for this and this is the hour and I said well why was this demon powers of spiritualism how did the devil know it that fortune teller and he said as it was in the days of the Lord he said that's the reason I knew that it wasn't of the Lord it wasn't the Lord because he said our Lord he he's talking about the angel he said and as in the Days of Our Lord sorry that's the reason I knew the angel was of the Lord sorry I said that wrong and he regarded our Lord as as our Lord him and brother brandham and he was the angel the man messenger and he say then in the days of the Lord when the ministers and the priests were in the temple they argued what kind of clothes they would should wear and the same thing and all these astronomers and he said that was the way they worshiped Jesus they knew him and the clergies didn't know him he's talking about the devil knew Jesus but the preachers in the Bible didn't and he said now the devil he said it's a devil the devil that said you know that you were you are a holy one of God and the priest said you are of the devil you are bth the devil now they said that to Jesus brother Rams just rephrasing that he said he's the son of God and the ministers here the Min the devil's saying he's the son of God and the ministers are calling Jesus the devil and he said the scare began to leave me and he talked about Paul and Silas and they they turned the world upside down he said the fortune teller said he said these men of God that tell you the way of life he said who is right he said the great deal the great deal the way it is today and that's true he said the Bible becomes a brand new book he said could you see it he said blessed are the eyes who can see and the ears that can hear for God has did this thing and Jesus said no man will come unto me unless the father draws them and my sheep will hear my voice and a stranger they won't follow ain't a that amazing how God was was breaking his commission down amen and so brother Brown shows how in his life the ministers never even knew recognize the gift that was in brother Brown's life amen and so is it today amen God's the same yesterday today and forever and let's just was was we're doing good here but let's you know we we laid our foundation of of God speaks in the heavenlies and and I believe we're going to go on a Rapture here soon and and and so we've read all those scriptures and and I just wanted to show you that when I was looking for how God speaks in the Heavenly here brother Brown's talking about his commission and it'll help you understand things in your life if we understand brother brandham and the things that he run into and his life amen and so we know and and this coming uh uh some of you many of you's probably seen this online and that but we know this coming April 24th we're going to have a solar eclipse and this will be the four the third solar eclipse that's happened fairly recently in our time since 2017 now we've already laid the foundation for our scriptures that a Rapture is going to have to happen sometime and it would appear like by the signs of the times that that's going to be soon and so we see that the first two solar eclipses that happened in 2017 and 2023 amen uh made an A on the earth made an a across the states and in the Biblical Hebrew word that a is a ancient uh it's t AV tog was an X it was a type of the Cross but now in April this April in Jan uh April 8th 20 uh 2024 we're going to have another solar eclipse where the Moon which represents is just a reflection of the sun watch all the natural tapes is spiritual we're just a reflection of Christ is going to completely blot out the Sun and so it'll be Darkness on the earth for for a uh a moment and so let's just just walk into this so when that uh Eclipse that happens in April it's going to make it like an AEG so you you can pull that up if you got that picture Amy but in the Hebrew letter it's it's uh Alpha tear Alpha which means and we're going to read that Revelations uh 216 we'll pull it up when you're when you're done there but Revelations 26 and this Alpha here's God signing his name on America with the Bible making it a thing and this was Alpha and Omega the Hebrew word means Alpha and Omega the beginning begin and the end he said here in Revelations 21:6 he said I am and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and so we see here in the Bible that when uh when Jonah when uh Jonah went to Nineveh and ministered in ancient times they had signs in the heavens also too and we know the story of Jonah and that and the Bible talks about that uh if I find my scripture here here we go maybe we'll just pull that up uh Amy Matthew 12 41- 42 and the men of n of us shall raise in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn us it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold there's a greater than Jonah here that's about that's that's Jehovah himself and the queen of the South will raise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the outermost parts of the earth just to see the wisdom of a man that never had the Holy Ghost of Solomon and behold the Holy Ghost is here amen so we see see here you know that Jonah went to Nineveh and they repented because they seen the power of God and the queen of the South repented because she seen the power of God and we actually have the power of God they just had a types and shadows of the power of God but we have the Jehovah Gyra in our midst and so many times we don't live like that God help us so we see that in the ancient times they had a solar eclipse and it was in Nineveh and it was uh it was during the time that Noah or Jonah sorry ministered you know there Jonah ministered 40 days and the people repented and you if you look in the Bible you know God uses numerology so many times and so I'm just going to mention something here sidestep in the Bible you know in the Bible it rained for 40 days and 40 nights but it stopped on 41 most committed murder and hid in the desert for 40 years but he come back in 41 to rescue a people Moses went up in the mountain for 40 days and in the 41th day he broughts the Commandments back Israel wered in the wilderness for 40 years but in the 41st year they went to the promised land Goliath tormented Israel for 40 days but on the 41st day David set him straight power of God Amen and Jonah preached the message of repentance to Nineveh 40 days and on the 40 first day God stopped his plan of Resto of destroying them wow Jesus fasted 40 days and on the 40 first day the devil fled so these are all typologies and you know it's wrote in symbols and you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost to understand this and you say well I don't mean nothing to me remember God's hiding it from the wise and The Prudent he's hiding it from the people that aren't his and so you got to have Revelation I'm not trying to make the Bible say nothing that it ain't saying if you don't see it it's perfectly fine but I read you all those quotes the foundation in the beginning of the message of go brother brandom your Prophet said and the Bible said that God talks through the sky and if he's this you know if he ain't the same God he's not a god at all amen so we see that when this Eclipse comes through in April it's going to [Music] cross it's going to when it goes through America when it crosses America this solar eclipse it's going to cross seven cities that are named Nineveh and they're the same name that Jonah preached to and the Bible says that they repented but we wouldn't because the Bible says not the bride I mean you understand but the Bible said that ninva repented but this generation wouldn't and he would judge it now we're not talking about the elect lady the elect lady's already sealed amen you understand what I'm saying but this generation wouldn't repent now watch this but there's actually eight cities that this solar eclipse is going through on April 8 and eight your Prophet said is back to the beginning or eternity you know where the eight city is Nova Scotia Canada okay I I know this sounds crazy you know when I seen this first and God spoke to me I went back on the internet to find it and they had erased the cities the fact Checkers amen I'm telling you I believe with all my heart we're going home soon I don't know if it'll be this year I don't know if it'll be 5 5 years from now and I'm not saying change anything you're doing but I just believe we I I believe that our whole Focus besides worship and obedience should be preparing for a Rapture I believe that with all my heart now now I'm I'm saying you have to we have to we would freeze to death if we didn't prepare for I'm not saying don't prepare for old age yeah I'm prepared for old age but I I'm not really sure I'll be here for that I I pray to God I'm not pray to God I've had enough Taste of old age I don't need anymore amen I'm I'm dead serious we we cannot love this world and and think that we're going to be here forever you're not going to be here forever you weren't born to build a kingdom it's God's kingdom you were born to bring glory to God and go home I mean I know it's a paradox it it messes up your mind let me just read some of these cities and and I want to show you another example this this Dove tales that goes forever and and I hope you'll let me finish this today but so Nineveh the first city is in Texas the next one is in Mississippi the next one Nineveh you does anybody I wouldn't even have knew there was cities Nam like that who would pick a name Nineveh who picks these names Nineveh Indiana he said this will be the the highest altitude of the eclipse there's a Nineveh and Ohio Pennsylvania Virginia New York and the eighth one is in Nova Scotia is it possible God's trying to tell us something is it possible God's writing in the heavens of Revelation 216 that I am the Alpha and Omega and it's completely finished if you believe this message it's finished we're not looking for another messenger we're not looking for another thus sayth the Lord we already got thus sayith the Lord up I me everywhere amen hallelujah and when you compare I'm not trying to make the scriptures please forgive me I'm not trying to make the scriptures say something that's not saying but when you look at this generation won't pass away and as in in the days of Sodom and you look at the signs in the heavens there's a purpose for these things amen now you know if you look at that so if you look at the last eclipse solar eclipse that went through it went through Salem and know and God does there's nothing per chance we're not we don't believe in luck or just just like oh you know what I mean good luck that's that's garbage we're Believers when God came and the solar eclipse the last uh the solar eclipse the first solar eclipse it went through salom it only went through Seven Cities which eight is back to Eternity the beginning seven is perfection seven is Christ it was through in Salem of Oregon and Wyoming and and all these Kentucky Mississippi South Carolina and all these cities see how the the the amazing how God's readying these things in the skies and unless you really study the scriptures do you know before they had the written bible that's the only Bible the only Bible they read but we're so advanced in knowledge we don't even use paper anymore praise God because everything's on screens everywhere and there's nothing wrong with that but you see how things have changed so much but all our all the things that we believe in the Bible was was for tolded in the skies how the how the how the Shepherds went to Jesus was told in the skies how the wise men went to Jesus was told in the skies I mean everything and we have no problem believing that but oh well oh now this is a stretch or is it amen God help us he said now here the most striking piece of evidence is the center line of the eclipse that exits the United States it ACS directly over and you have to forgive me because I'm close to but I'm going to name the name of the the city and the city that it exits the states means the body of Christ and it's ch h r i s TI and then that's the first word and the next word is c r p s the city that the solar eclipse exits United States and he said that's that City's name is the only name of a city in the world in the world the body of Christ is where the soul Eclipse goes off in the heavenlies wow what all would this mean amen well we just know that we're living that you know it should change our I mean I'm not I mean you got the Holy Ghost you already have the right desires but you know what I'm saying it just change our our it it'll it'll it'll bring into line our thought pattern and when you see these things and and and I showed you brother Brown's commission to show you that not every religious or spiritual person you're going to talk to is going to see what God's doing I me you understand and I'm not trying to make something up I'm not trying to be like super no no and I I'm not putting a day on it I don't mean I mean I still am looking for 40 or so grandkids but I'm just being reality the other way maybe that there'll be spoken word grandkids in heaven amen but there there's some tremendous things that happen here amen here you know we mentioned about Jonah was given 40 days to warn ninama and from April 8th the time of the eclipse 40 days from a 48 is May 18th and it's the day of Pentecost amen you can just line up so much stuff here here the the next example is the third part of this the end of this solar eclipse will take seven years God always uses numbers in the Sev that's completion and Perfection example he created the world in seven years of and you know so many things that God himself was seven amen if you want to look at some more uh things that maybe are not so uh uh based on us so much but uh the city in uh Texas that the it passes through sorry it just nameing some of the other cities that The in the states that this uh solar eclipse will pass through that are not named Nineveh it's passing through a city's name in Indiana called Rapture it's passing through will will uh a city in Kentucky it's passing through where the ark encounter is located the full size of Noah's Ark the city where Noah's Ark is at is passing through Eagle Pass in Texas where they're having the states is having all the Border issues the solar eclipse is passing through it's po when it crosses the point at the axe is the area in Southern Illinois where it's called Little Egypt is the cross of the solar eclipse amen Little Egypt is Savaged in between two other cities that are called Alpha Kentucky and Omega Illinois both having the 2017th eclipse came over their cities amen you you couldn't make this up there's not a politician in the world that can make all this up amen and the 2017 and the 24 the eclipse that's coming occur directly over new the fault line the new magnetic fault line the earthquake fault line amen how close are we when you look at all these things amen how close are we and if you look at just maybe our closing fact here he said one more interesting fact was that uh there was 2,422 days between the 17 solar eclipse and the solar eclipse that's coming and if you look up that number and the strong concordance of the Bible it takes the word from Exodus 1 19 which says the midwives answered Pharaoh the he the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women and they are virtuous and give birth before the midwives arrive talking about the strength that's in God's anointed at the time ain't that amazing how you can just piece these all together this just goes and goes and goes God speaking in the skies amen you know this world can't survive and we need to recognize that as the bride of Christ that God's calling us to go home amen and we need to bring in the last one and you know the Bible or scripture that we read you know when this word is preached in all the nations then the end will come but we've arrived to the End Amen and it should change it should change our whole being now I'm not talking about being unwise and don't prepare for winter or don't prepare for old age but I believe that if you look at the signs amen our Prophet believed that he would go in the Rapture he believed that bitterly and if you watch the world even the religious word even if you watch the message world are are we all expecting are we all just thinking like you know like Jared said during Co you know when when you have something like we have an anointing on us like you talk about a sign that ain't just focus on just the prophet now he had a special gift praying for the sick yes sir he did he was the the major Messenger to our yes sir he was amen but prophets and all the five-fold ministry you know the B it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have a sign on you let me bring it down to our our language the Bible says that let your light shine so when you get on this the bus in town that the fortune tellers will see a light around you you say well I don't think that would be for me that's what the Bible says says you'll be salty but there will be an atmosphere brother Brown said you are amateur creators and you you you are you he said you are you are Christ you are his bone and his flesh and you are the flesh body walking in Wyoming today that's Jehovah God Christ is the anointed one so I'm making it personal but watch this but see the preachers in brother Brown like not all the religious people recognized it and amen and even brother Brown didn't until the angel came to him but God will be sharing things with us and yes we're going to go ahead inside this church hopefully all this year and it'll be nice for when we're gone they can do whatever they want amen but I believe we're going home real soon and I don't believe I don't believe and and there was there's probably twice as much stuff in there facts about the solar eclipse than what I shared with you there's no way that a physical government and a God could come together and all the lines line up so perfectly it's God telling us something this world can't survive this this world can't survive you know all the news you know what's going on everywhere in the world it cannot survive can't survive and there's already War right beside Israel right around Israel right almost you might say in Israel and all it's got to do is RA up the hatred for Israel which that's all uhhuh the Israel president refuses to follow the US plan for a double State man that's all that has to happen we're not here when that happens you know we're not here when the Tabernacle is built the prophet said that we're not here we're not here for that it'll just you say well how are they ever going to build the Tabernacle when there's already things on the mount one bomb just one bomb just one bomb am but we're not here for that we're not even here for any of the atomic bombs you do you know that potin warned the the the uh whatever the the NATO that if they send ground troops into to Ukraine I'm not afraid of it I say praise the Lord hallelujah I want to have to pay my taxes amen Putin out of his own mouth said you'll start World War III if you sending ground troops in ugan and Ukraine and he said I will not rule out nuclear war amen you you say Brother D why are you preaching like this you need to go listen to the prophet he preached like that he preached like that you people building all these bunkers and all that and he said you going to be just the only thing you need is just be protected by the feathers of Jehovah Gyra the baptism of the Holy Ghost man brother Brown preach like this all the time we we don't hear this kind of preaching anymore we're going going home we're going home every part of our every part you know last night fellowship and everything we should be just glued to one we're going to go home together together we're going to spend eternity together together that don't make us crazy that's this is real this is real you you you wonder I I mean I'm not trying to make this political at all I could care less about politics it's all of the devil every government everything some of the richest people in the world are selling off their wealth their stocks turning it to Gold precious metals and a lot of their precious the the the wealthiest people in the world remember brother Brown said don't don't mock them this is the only Heaven they'll have on Earth this is their Paradise this is not brother Dale's Paradise here I'll tell you what it's becoming less Paradise than you ever did see the richest people in the world are building bomb shelters 7,000 s ft bomb shelters CU they think this is their heaven and for them it is brother Dale's not building a bomb shelter I'm building a holy ghost shelter and I'm going to recognize the stuff that's happening not from a political standpoint I'm going to recognize it from look at the time clock you can't just look at your watch and say well I think maybe next week you know I can't do that to you and if I did I'd be foolish and false and a liar but I'm telling you we're in the atmosphere we're in the har Church brother Brown preached Harvest Time 70 some years ago hello he said I can hear the combine coming 70 some years ago a generation ago amen I'm not saying change one thing in your family but just make sure that you have the anointing and the dove of the Holy Spirit just an atmosphere that's sweet you know the Holy Spirit don't bark you know I read some things on Wednesday night you know any of you to come Wednesday Wednesday night was just amazing you know the brother Brown talked about the Dove and he said if you bark like a wolf he said the dove would fly away man we can't doves don't eat each other they don't have G they just eat the word of God and it's that a whole thing is just atmosphere and our home should just be am man you don't think so it I I'm telling you it's don't put everything on the profit you I mean the prophet had a special gift yes but he had the same Holy Ghost you have it's the same God great I mean listen to the pro listen to our prophet's message he said Jesus was was was God in flesh yes he was but he said God made a tabernacle and he said Jesus was just the flesh body and Christ the Holy Ghost came inside him and he was the god that was in him when God was done with that body he could care less about that flesh amen it's not about to bad your skin so the same holy ghost that was in Christ Jesus is exactly in you we're living brother Brown said you're living a million miles below what God has for you A Million Miles because it's it's everything amen oh hallelujah amen I'm not trying to Let's stand I'm not saying everything that you know if it's man-made and that we we we know that man can imitate and copy even uh Satan can imitate and copy all the gifts and all these things but when things happen that man can't control and God's doing it in nature in the skies you don't have to believe me but if you believe your prophet and you look at what he said and the very very very first Bible was wrote in the skies and God will still use that Sky to write again and he's doing it I believe he's doing it right now amen God help us to God help me amen just to even even when we go on and live our lives to always have that realm amen I pray to God that we'll see I mean we don't you know but brother Brown's seen so many things that it'll be the world that'll see the light over you it'll be the world that'll catch the environment when they come in when they come in your circle and they'll feel there's something different about you amen God help us amen God help us I pray to God even as we work on the church you know it's not about this building this building is going to burn down amen it's just a bunch of old 2x4s and they're extremely dirty but the workers that are coming out here will feel a different atmosphere this is where the Shina glory is I mean it's in us but when we're here together brother Brown said we bring in our licks of fire and this place is a holy thing and there's people walking in here and dropping off money and charges and putting us first and actually doing different things man that's no mistake it's an atmosphere it's a Heavenly atmosphere it's not about brother Dale it's about us all it's about God it's the Holy Ghost in every one of us it's different amen amen man we need to in our children just reck make our children understand and and recognize not fear it's not fear at all it'll be one we're going to be together there more together there than we are here amen amen who knows every year it's a big year there a lot of things going to happen and I'm I'm going to close I'm just saying there's a lot of things happening really fast there's a lot of elections coming up really fact and I have no faith in them zero faith in them I'm just saying there's a lot of environment and world and wars and dictatorships and all these things and then when you look in the skies God's telling us something too help me let's pray for let's let's keep really keep each
