going home soon I mean I I just I just I just amen anybody that would be offended that we're going to go home soon in a Rapture needs to get on their knees because the rapture we are in the Rapture we're not just gonna go in a Rapture we're already in the Raptors in process amen and I I believe we're not going to be here long but if God tarries amen it'll be a benefit to the children that they have a place to gather amen forsake not the summoning of yourself together and like manner that some have already done but gather all the more as you see the day approaching amen so when that was wrote in the scripture there was already some people and take Church man Spirits don't change they don't die it says like in like manner like some have already done but to come all the more God bless you brother Fred amen as you see the day approaching amen so we're going to ask that any children that would like to participate you do not this doesn't have to be your home Church any children that

Everlasting father a man of his kingdom there shall be no end oh so wonderful we love the Lord Jesus and greetings to all that are online I'm so sorry that you were hindered by the ice and the snow and the things that come maybe perhaps in the evening time overnight but we're glad that all that got to come are here this this morning and God bless you each and um we sure are looking forward to what the Lord will speak to us in just a moment and I want to call my title this morning becoming one mind before the rapture becoming one mind before the Rapture now you talk about miracles getting us all in the same mind even if you're on the straight and narrow you're on the level your bubble's on the level you know what I'm talking about even then you're talking about miraculous what God's going to do for us amen Philippians 2 verse 1. Apostle Paul speaking if there be any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and Mercies fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded having the Same Love being of one Accord and of one mind he said brother Ben is it going to happen God said so and if he put this in his word I am confident he can bring us to that place I believe that with all of my heart I believe that do I understand all of it and how it's going to work absolutely not I wouldn't even be silly enough to try to conjecture how it's going to happen but God said it'll be there and brother Gordon if you said it it's going to happen just the way he put it in there amen I believe that let nothing be done through Strife or vainglory but in say this with me lowliness of mine you remember last night now the message is surrender this is the aspect that we need that part of our life to get to these places we're talking about Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus now I want to read to you from questions and answers brother Adam says I'm here to try to help you because I love you you're my children that I have begotten to Christ I claim every one of you I claim you tonight I claim you all the time I always claim you as my brother and sister you're my children I'm your father in The Gospel not father as it would be a priest he says but I'm your father in The Gospel as Paul said there I have begotten you to Christ and now I have espoused you to Christ that's engaged you to Christ as a chaste virgin now listen to this two times he says Don't Let Me Down don't let me down let's pray over the word father we counted a privilege Lord to be in your presence and father we are so grateful today for the Holy Ghost to come into this place like you've come this morning with all the worship and the prayers and the things going up every part of the service perfectly in order just as you would have it now Lord comes the sincere and the most important and sacred part of any Gathering or assembly like this and that's the preaching of the Gospel Lord you never put us in a spot of time we're not denominational minded where we just take a few minutes and amen and run everybody out the door and we've done our religion but Lord we come in here to settle in and hear from you Lord if it takes 40 minutes or 40 hours or 40 days and nights we want to hear from you Lord Jesus that is our anticipation and Lord with this Gathering of people why would any man bring a gathering in like this and not expect the Holy Spirit to speak to him Lord why would anybody come and assemble like this without that expectation in their heart Lord we don't come because it's protractive we come because that burning desire in us to hear from you that's why we assemble father we thank you Lord for that desire and that dedication burning in the heart of each one we pray that you'll honor that today Lord and you'll see that deep in their calling to the deep and speak to us through Thy word I submit and surrender myself to you I Surrender this audience to you may the Holy Spirit put stops to any kind of interruption or thing that Satan might try to put whether it be in our mind or some other kind of thing May the Holy Ghost take preeminence over this service today may you speak to us in every single way God as we yield our bodies mind Spirit Soul all of us to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you really good amen appreciate your patience and with all that singing and everything amen we're already up here to a little bit after 11 o'clock but amen I I somebody said you preached two hours and I said yeah but I sang 30 of it Hallelujah but but anyways we we appreciate the Lord and I I want if God will help me and I'm kind of dovetailing a little bit with some of the thoughts we had uh last night in terms of the um the unity of the spirit something the Holy Spirit led me to say last night that I I enjoyed hearing it and I hadn't really thought of it too deeply until we got into this uh last night but this little statement that was made about the young people last night and how that we need to encourage I got to thinking about the encouragement of young people and I thought about myself you know when I started preaching I was 14 years old and I went many many years without a mentor of any kind nobody ever took me under their arm and said hey do it this way or say that I I learned through just blab it and grab it open my mouth say something stupid that next time and uh and then to say something that worked they remember that one put that one down in the book and uh the Lord you genuinely taught me how to be the right kind of Christian but I thought back on my life of how many years I suffered not having someone to take me by the hand and talk to me and explain things to me and and and I wonder in the light of the message we're going to try to talk about today I want to revisit just that idea a little bit because when I look at what brother Branham said about the cloud coming you remember when the prophecy the clown the one thing that he made the statement about uh in prayer he said now Lord you see about the revelation of that cloud and how the Holy Spirit was going to come and reveal he said and especially you young people he said about the young people and you know I've never really considered myself much of a young people's preacher because I've always been one of the young people myself but I know that as age kind of goes on in time I know that age is going to take care of that young person thing after a while anyways but looking back now on my 20s and my teenage years and things like that I realized that a lot of the hardships that I went through as a beginning believer and starting out some of it was absolutely unnecessary because there were people sitting in the pews that had age and experience that could have reached out to me and give me a little nugget every now and then now I don't mean metal in your life and micromanage your life and dictate to you what you ought to do and not do but just words of wisdom from time to time and I think that it behooves us in a gathering like this to set our affection upon what we need to do as the other stage of Life coming on the other side of life and maybe you're thinking well there ain't nothing that I can do for God I can't preach I don't pastor church I'm not really a musician or singer or anything like that yes but if you are carrying in your head the hoary head of wisdom today you have life stepping stones that you can share and show other people around you younger how to avoid the pitfalls of life I believe the Bible tells us let the Elder women teach the younger ones and us as young people and treat the Elder as fathers and regard them as brothers and so forth now if we're ever going to come to the place to where we as the believing people of God I want you to listen close to this if we ever come to the places the believing people of God that we can come in the harmony of the spirit we're going to have to remember that the body of Christ ain't made up of just old people that walk with brother Branham but it's made up of the young ones just the same as it is the middle age or whatever stage of Life they're in it's made up of males it's made up of females and we are the the body of Christ and members in particular so it behooves us as the people of God to consider that every single part of the body of Christ is important and even in society we look at the elderly brother Jose sometimes people throw them off into society they're useless and they don't have any uh way of it and then young people are treated the exact same way well you're wet behind the ears and you don't know nothing don't you think that that's kind of a wrong statement to put before a child or before a teenager or someone they can't help it that they don't have the experiences they can't help it that they're 15 or 19 or 25. amen they are walking exactly as God has separated them from their mother's womb and give them birth in this life whatever stage they're in that's where they are but for us to be the right kind of people we ought to be able to share our experiences our testimonies and share with each other the things that we know in this life I mean if you see young girls or doing things maybe that ain't all that pleasing to the Lord it always baffles my mind why people got to be critical why is that the default way of trying to help somebody along why not come to them with the sweetness of an aged person or somebody that's been down that road and say now listen this is not critical but you know you would look nice if you've done this or it would sound better if you said that and let me tell you a story about so and so but many times we approach it with a critical ear a critical heart a critical mind ready to correct ready to put somebody in their place friends do you realize the Bible does not give us permission to nitpick and micromanage and nag each other amen the Bible said the only time that you are to go to somebody in situations is when you see that person overtaken in a fall go back and read in the book of Galatians amen if your brother offends you rebuking between you and him Amen in other words talk to him about it tell him how you felt about it amen but don't go to everybody's doorstep and try to clean up their doorsteps amen don't go to everybody's house and start looking through the cupboards and everywhere to see if a television is hiding somewhere amen you sweep your steps I'll sweep mine and we'll serve God in the newness of Life come on somebody say Amen amen I know that sounds hard and I cannot tell you right away that that's one of the hardest things to do is to Simply mind your own business here we go again brother Jim I'm already back in the mode again but you're just gonna have to hang with me because this is where we had amen it's it's hard for us to have that kind of attitude but listen minding your own business doesn't mean that you you ignore your brother ignore your sister but as Paul said here be mindful of the things that each other is going through you see somebody not coming to church for a couple weeks amen what's wrong with sending them a text message or giving them a phone call or putting a card in the mail thinking of you just wants you to know that you're loved amen I was in a meeting some time ago and there was a certain individual that was teeter-tottering on suicide very very mentally oppressed type person had just all kinds of mental battles all the time and they confessed to me that they was on the verge of putting a gun in their mouth amen until one day a text message come and somebody said just wanted you to know while they're holding the gun that you're loved you're not alone and Jesus loves you and I love you too amen I don't care what anybody says A Little Bit of Love Will grind over any old sore any old bitterness it will bring healing to the body amen if we show concerned amen not criticism concern amen we've been too critical that way amen I've lost count of the legalists around this message that are walking around with measuring sticks in their Hip Pocket to see how long the sister's dresses are and amen looking around to see if there's toenail pain or looking around and see if there's a necklace on them or some kind of how straight is their hair anyways and unfortunately you sisters are the one to get the brunt of that Brothers can hide a little bit easier than the women can amen and least little thing a woman does somebody's ready to trounce on them amen like a lion waiting in the jungle of someone another amen don't you know what we're doing to our sisters when we single them out every time they come to church we're making them feel like a second-class citizen we're making them feel like doormats amen and the Bible doesn't support it God condemns such a thing and God wants us to show love one to another and then hang in there with me a little while I won't hold you along just about three hours don't worry about it amen now listen again let's read it one more time Paul said fulfill you my joy if there be any consolation if there be any comfort of love if there be any Fellowship of the spirit if there be any vows or Mercies fulfill my joy that you're like-minded now having the Same Love having the same mind the word that Paul uses here is to agree together to cherish the same views to be harmonious to strive for one's interest or Advantage I like this one to be of one's party and to side with him in public affairs in public affairs now you see that reminds me brother Adam said it like this he said me and the branhams used to fight in the backyard he said now that was us branham's in the backyard he said but let one person jump on one of us branhams in the front yard and it was a different story amen that's what Paul's trying to tell us brother Jose he's trying to tell us that if we are to be like-minded it doesn't mean we have to agree 100 with another one insert amen here come on come on don't you get quiet on me I'll just get right out in the aisle and look you eye about eyeball come on right God ain't wanting us to be in total Harmony in the way of oh I see everything like you see it we will never see everything I die there'll be aspects of my walk and my vision and my thoughts and whatever whatever whatever that will not be the same as yours but God didn't ask me to be in total complete agreement with everybody I know but he asked me to live in harmony with him amen if you believe in one God if you believe in Jesus name baptism if you believe in a prophet messenger if you believe in wholeness amen there we can shake hands and be brothers and sisters and in the backyard we might sit in the fellowship hall and just just go at each other amen but don't let nobody pick on you in the front yard that's being like-minded having the same feeling you know we should never be the kind of people that when we see it listen I get aggravated that people like you do I might be a little bit more vocal than some of you are because some of y'all too holy to tell the truth I get aggravated at folks I see them living in a way that they shouldn't live I say that's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life my wife tells me all the time you are blunt as a hammer you think you're nice but you're really not sometimes I said well you're probably right about that amen but I get aggravated at people why I love them I haven't given my life In a Pulpit 31 years around the world because I don't want to see people make it I get frustrated at him because I know they can do better I know they got a better potential yet they won't absorb it into their hearts and yet that frustration you got to be careful there's a line there a level of frustration as you've got to remember sometimes God is the one in control and he's allowing that person to go through that Valley or that circumstance because there's something to mold them on the other side and you got to keep your little fingers and your little nosy nosy out of the business let God do the molding let God do the Shaving let God do the work on the person come on somebody you can't always take it into your hands as the final outworking of life right sometimes I look at people and I go feel sad for them that doesn't mean that I agree with everything they do I've had people in my life and Ministry I'm sure you have too that have just absolutely had such a spirit they want to kill you about things I'd have a lot more friends if I wasn't a preacher I've lost a lot of them preaching the truth standing for what's right A lot of them just turn their back on you flat I mean it hurts you when that happens amen but I don't just take that person and throw them off in hell and say Good Riddance good enough for you serves you right I start saying Lord I don't know what's going on in the front yard out here but God I'm going to do my very best to try to win them back with the love of God doesn't mean you compromise with them but it means that if you're going to put them in their place you'd be standing there while they're in their place with your arms out like this and say if you want to get straightened out right here's the way out I'll help you problem is we dig people in a hole and we leave them there and my Holy Ghost come with an escape hatch if I put somebody in and if he puts me in a trial the Bible said he would give me a way out amen amen he said in all the trials you've got I provide a way of escape to let you escape it amen my Holy Ghost has got an escape hatch yes sir nothing I get in he can't bring me out of it nothing that comes before me I could get cornered right up amen he's got a way of Escape for me to get out of there the bride ain't never been cornered into a place he can't make a hole through it the idea is that we as Christians many times you know you hear people even blaspheming the message they say oh done with them be careful Paul himself said he was a blasphemer if you'd have been standing there prior to Paul's conversion you'd have thrown the quotes at him you just said well you know Jesus said say a word against the Holy Ghost it'll never be forgiven but you see God has a different opinion than we do sometimes right and he looks at people through different eyes sometimes that's where we need to see people Through The Eyes of Calvary Through The Eyes of Jesus Christ having the same love having a harmony with people there are some folks I don't agree with because I see things they do and I think I shouldn't do that but I'm not going to kick them out I'm not going to cast them aside we're all on a journey some of you might be thinking you've arrived I got news for you probably ain't got started yet hello hello we're just on the way you said well I'm an old man old woman that doesn't matter where you are rather than look beyond the curtain of time there's a woman sitting there he said a beautiful woman he said she was past 90 when you led her to the Lord don't ever get it in your mind that age means that you're closer to God ain't got nothing to do with it amen God ain't as respecter of persons or aides or countenance or position or Prestige or nothing come on somebody all he looks at is a sincerity and the surrender of somebody's heart are they willing to give themselves to Jesus Christ or not amen amen oh praise the Lord let nothing be done through life or vain Glory now this is the condition that the bride is going to be in before the rapture looking pretty bleak right now ain't it but he's going to get us there sure enough now listen to this again the message Paradox brother remember says now how are we going to lose this great race question mark it's because we're divided how are we going to do it we've got to stay together because you see if you start drawing lines in the Sabbath who don't agree with you where does that stop and don't forget every time you draw a line in the sand on somebody somebody can draw the line on you this is what Jesus said judge not that you turn around and be judged the same way now if it's something on the basis of the word that's one thing the word will always separate truth from Air there are some people just like Saint John 6 6 that could No More Walk With Jesus not because Jesus didn't level not because Jesus didn't want to see him get saved but because they could not accept the word they couldn't walk with Christ themselves right now notice he said the Holy Ghost will take us all in it'll be a paradox if God ever gets us together but he will just trust him laughs he knows how to send persecution that will run us together I don't mind telling you just looking around this building this morning all of the things we've experienced in this province out here the last 20 years I've evangelized to you many years now I've watched you separated I've watched you divide it and I've watched you come together under the auspices of the holy spirit amen my hat is off to these Godly men amen and women around this message that have done their best in this province right here to find Unity One with another amen 10 years ago this province was as decided as I've ever seen anywhere in the entire continent of North America remember the Holy Ghost through your determination and your desire to be the Bride of Jesus Christ has helped you find Harmony don't you know that's what the devil hates he knows that in unity There Is Power amen and if there's power in Harmony and unity amen you get one lick of fire to put it with another one another one another one another one amen it will run every devil out of here and put them under your feet I remember when I was doing the camp out there amen one of the first camps we did God Almighty I heard one criticism after another people jumped all over me you ought to know better than that but I saw the vision that the tomatoes and the other people had I saw the vision of trying to bring people together without one big boss over everything amen trying to run this on a corner and run that one this way listen God wants us to be so together that we could chew each other's chewing gum and in a coveted age that's a pretty God that's not a big dose of God's grace Amen to be in such a condition that you'd even be willing to pull your mass down long enough to choose somebody's chewing gum I don't mean no harm but brother Brenham said that's the kind of love we should have one for another amen don't get me no chewing gum I ain't chewing your chewing gum remember what he's talking about is he's talking about the love we have one for another amen you have a personality about you you may not always be a people person that's okay but you need to be available that if someone needs you God can use you for that person's life right this is the reason why people with gifts they have a hard time exercising them singing and doing other things in the body because they feel like they're such a strange duck or an odd duck they don't feel like they got any value in the body every person in this church this morning has some value somewhere I don't care your age or station or how much money you make or don't make you have value in the eyes of Jesus Christ come on somebody preach to me amen the Holy Ghost wants you to see that you are valuable to the body of Jesus Christ you're not a second-class citizen Amen to brother Jose some years ago I remember we had that big meeting remember we called all the Brethren up to the platform garms and show we're going to have Unity amen these Brethren have kept that alive since the Holy Spirit gave that oh God I got criticized by preachers do you know who you had on the platform with you I said well I got two eyes I reckon I did didn't matter whether I agree with their theologies or not and not that I disagree with these Brethren I don't mean that but I mean in general speaking it didn't matter what we saw Adam or didn't see amen what I saw was the need for Unity amongst the body of Christ amen but people have such a strong stance about everything you know and if you don't see this one issue Hallelujah then you don't even bribe that's not for you to call or anybody else to determine that's up to Jesus Christ to call and if I've got to Holy Ghost and my doctrine of my understanding is wrong about something that's up to him to make it right for me to understand it not somebody else amen the Bible said the Holy Ghost would lead us and guide us into all truth didn't say you would didn't say I would hello I'm putting my glasses on to see you frowning at me amen right that's true notice now let's go back to Philippians chapter 2 verse 19 now now I want you to listen at a couple things Paul identifying Timothy as his son in the gospel and uses this term like-minded again for Timothy now watch us Philippians 2 19 but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send to methus shortly unto you that I also may be of good Comfort when I know your state for I have no man like-minded who will naturally care for your state now the word he uses here for like-minded in this case is equal in Soul as far as Paul was concerned Timothy had the spirit the vision and the purpose of Paul's message so close to his heart that to Paul when Timothy was standing here it was the same as if Paul was standing there I don't know what that does to you but I'll tell you what it does to me I want to have such the same vision brother Branham I want to have such the same ideas and the passion and and the purposes that brother Branham had in his heart for Humanity and for the bride of Christ that every time I stand Here it'd be the same as the prophet of God standing here I may not sound like him and say good evening friends and I may not amen like hunting and running around doing those things and out in the wilderness that brother Brown did amen but I can have the same vision the same purpose and the same mind that brother Branham had and preach it just exactly like it'd be him delivering it himself oh I know that that that shakes the group I feel it you say well that I don't know if I can trust that hang on what you're saying is you don't know if you can trust your feeling about it you can trust God's word because he said he gave some Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors he gave Farmers Factory workers Housewives and maybe a lawyer or two every now and who knows come on you understand God set in the body those that would have the same vision the same purpose well we can't trust men that's what the tape people are saying we can't trust them to give us the truth we can't trust but the Bible didn't say that the Bible did not say that brother Branham was the only one we could trust in this age find it find me one place that brother man said I'm the only one you can listen to and Trust in the last day he didn't even believe that about praying for the sick look how many times he come to the end of a prayer line he'd say now to show you that this ain't all about me I want my brethren to come up here and lay hands on the sick too same purpose same vision same mind same thoughts Same Love same Comfort there be any vows of Mercy have that same purpose be equal in Soul if a man preaches with that kind of vision this is why it's always so important to keep that message right on the Bible and keep that Bible right on the message and keep everything married together so when you present this to the body of Christ amen they can feel it just like brother Brennan will be standing right here I want to preach repentance in Jesus name the same as if Simon Peter was standing right here just the same passion he had at Pentecost where he said men and brethren what can we do to be saved and Peter screamed down repair every one of you and be baptized God let my soul be knit together with you that when I preached repentance in the name of Jesus Christ and baptism in the name of Jesus Christ let me say it just exactly the same way that Peter would have said it with those keys jangling in his hand that way the people can trust the word not me because that's what we're supposed to trust anyways the word not just some man cursed it is he that leans to the arm of the flesh but not the one that leans to the word word is what's got the power in it that's the one that's got the authority in it I love this again Titus Chapter 1 Verse 4. now Paul then calls Titus his own son after the common Faith he calls it then again in first Timothy 1 and 2 Timothy my own son in the faith First Timothy 1 18 this charge I commit unto thee son Timothy second Timothy 1 2 to Timothy my dearly beloved Son second Timothy 2 and 1. thou therefore my son then in Philemon chapter 1 verse 10 I beseech thee from my son onsimus so here these men are being identified in the Bible by Paul who said if anyone comes contrary even Me Myself and preaches anything different let him be accursed and this Saint Paul tells what you've learned from me commit thou to the hands of Faithful Men and ordain Elders in every city didn't say order hey players hello I'm telling my age and the young people went tape tape what tape Scotch tape duct tape didn't say take mechanical devices and set them up on the platform so one thing that I'm so grateful of when we hit that coveted time amen we might have had to use the internet amen but men of God proved that even if they shut the church down they'll never shut the bride up she'll keep on preaching no matter what somebody asked me when everything went down they said what did you do I said I was preaching more during that time and I'd ever been preaching in life amen I was doing broadcasts every single week I was on the internet I was recording videos and sending to people to preach I preached one here in the church amen that I'd preached a month before that or something and I sent it over amen what I'm trying to say the prophet said they'll never shut the bride up God will take her up out of here amen She'll always have a voice that voice is the voice of God to this last generation and if we've got the same ideas the same passion let me read it again here is the secret of this that no one was reading Friday night I was going to hit this thing Sunday morning the word is in the bride whether they'll start reading this and I punch Samantha I said wait wait till Sunday the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with that word and she performs the command of the word in his name for she has the saith the Lord [Applause] preach right he said then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose amen so that bride not only has the word and the mind she knows what he wants done with that word now folks this is where we've got to get in our mind if I've got to hold his Spirit if I've got to word if I've got that seed inside my heart and I see my brothers and sisters in a spot to where that they don't know what the answer is what am I supposed to do take that word that's buried in my heart talk to Daddy a little while and say help me find an answer to help my brother and my sister you see divided we're weak unified we're strong yeah I can't be legalist about this now can't be my foreign no more you got to keep up keep a little door on your circle to let other people in uh-huh because if you don't that's what we call denomination let me say to you like the ones I teach English as I said denomination say it denomination that's the spirit of organization if they don't agree with me they don't agree with you we don't agree with each other and whatever whatever if you're Baptist you're Baptist you're Catholic you're Catholic you're method should Memphis whatever you are amen that is a disorganized Spirit God don't want that in the body of Jesus Christ remember the Bible the message itself has been revealed will never become an organizational thing amen the message itself there's no period in the message the longer I study it the more God keeps revealing in this message but there are denominational Spirits right around our ranks they do everything they can to divide and put their little feelers out there to see do you see it like I said do you agree with me I'm not talking about people a man that are living in filth that we should agree with them or people that live like the devil are completely blaspheming the very truth of this message amen we've got to be careful who we walk with that's true amen but if you're talking about little tiny things along the way amen when you see a man or woman doing their best to serve God Amen stop taking them in the mud and lift them up and be a brother and a sister to them amen because any one of us could go home with each other and by the end of the night pull the book on each other you could pull the book on me and I could pull the book on you but if we're trying to serve God that's the key of it all amen if our desire is to serve Jesus Christ that's what you focus on praise the Lord Ryan having the same mind she has thus saith the Lord so if she's got it word is revealed to my heart let's say God reveals something to me and shows me something that could help somebody else that I take experience and I take things that I've gone through and things that I've had happen or whatever it may be and I take that and I mix it with an answer in the word of God and I tell it to that brother or that sister or that family or whatever that's as though God is speaking to that person it's a hard one to swallow ain't it but it ain't your thought it's the word of God you're using and when God brings you through something and you've got a testimony that testimony mixed with the word the revelation of truth that is God speaking to that I'll put him get somewhere amen I was reading a thing on Facebook the other day some person got on there some poor blind deluded keyboard Warrior keyboard Warrior that's all they are they ain't got enough guts in them to stand face to face with the man of God or with the servant of the Lord and talk plainly to people they've got to hide behind a computer somewhere another I said ain't no such thing as good preachers and right preachers the only right preachers there are are the ones that puts brother Brennan back in the Pulpit well I got news for that bunch I never took him out of it I pack him with me every time I preach you listen to me for 30 minutes you're gonna hear me say brother Brown and said the prophet said the Bible said amen I never took him out of the pulpit he's always been here in Spirits because I've got his soul his mind his passion his ideas and having that same soul of that same nature and I don't mean literally now but that same spiritual something from Christ to see the message for what it should be that's been carrying with me since God anointed me to preach I never took him out of it amen only those that believe he's never been here and never been around they just don't understand amen that the very Spirit of Elijah never left this age even though he pulled the man the spirit remained on the people amen amen and how's it being fulfilled in this day and age will the bride brother around however revivalist said that's what's going on will she have a Ministry he said that's it Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors oh thank you Lord notice in Romans chapter 12 verse 16. let's put this one up together Romans 12 and 16. be of the same mind one toward another does yours say the same thing mind does mine not high things wow so you see the Bride of Jesus Christ isn't going to be shooting for the loftiness of society you know she doesn't want to live so high and mighty that the poor beggar coming off the street of the prostitute can't seem to connect with him praise God you know the people that Jesus interacted with that misunderstood him was these Pharisees that were here high and lofty you know the ones that understood him prostitutes Beggars thieves Liars whoremongers you know why Jesus made himself available to them we almost treat people in the messages though if they're just not right up in some big lofty Godly business I've seen people in the message put one preacher up like he's the greatest in the world because he has such a powerful gift and some little low brother that's barely able to harvest speak but yet he's cold yet he doesn't have a great delivery and they treat him like he's a second-class citizen and put this big preacher up over there you are doing the same thing that every denomination is done for 200 years I don't care if he's Spanish or he's German or whatever he might be if he's got the Holy Ghost and gifted to preach to me he's my brother and I want to open my heart to what he has to say not everybody's called to preach to everybody some people are called to certain circles of the world and I may only get a nugget out of that preaching but in that nugget better than nothing uh-huh we shouldn't have our favorite preachers we should have our favorite Jesus oh aliens were quiet and I know when they get quiet usually is when they're being preached on come on now caught with your hand and the cookie jar a little bit are you well I know we got our favorites listen we can have people we enjoy hearing but nobody should be a favorite the word should be the favorite hahaha right but condescend to men of low estate huh kind of sounds like humility to me be not wise in your own conceits or your own conceptions of what you think and what you believe Romans chapter 15 now verse 5. did I go a bit further thank you say it quick before you can say no Romans 15 5 watch us now the god of patience and consolation grants you to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus did you notice how he introduced this the god of patience because God knows he's going to need a lot of patience until we get like-minded come on preach to me now right he knows he's gonna have to be long suffering he knows he's going to have to wait it out because you get two two ideas and it takes a while just like a marriage it takes a while to blend your spirits together and to find Harmony but you know you can do it if you try if you try hard enough you can find Unity with somebody you completely disagree with they said that's the one thing about brother Bradham he said that you never knew who his friends were you never who his enemies were well Hallelujah should we have the altar call now or oh I know it stings it should it should shame on all of us me included for allowing such foolishness to enter into the message of this hour this is the smut Brothers said keep off it having these attitudes in these ways and I don't like that one I don't know what that One Believes and I don't like the way he says that and I don't even know these quotes I don't care whether or not somebody believes that God is green blue or purple if he's trying to serve God I figure all of us will figure it out down the road just because somebody has maybe a different view on something that does not mean that I can put them out of the body of Christ besides how do I know I'm not wrong aha amen oh mercy even the preacher's getting quiet on me babies are even getting quiet on me right second Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 7. finally Brethren farewell be perfect be of good comforts be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you well now we're supposed to be another book of Acts right we're supposed to write another book right we're supposed to put forth another Branch right I'll just say the way you Canadian said a huh what if we're going to put it forth and this is what it looks like an apple ain't going to put forth oranges oranges ain't going to produce tangelo it's a tangible ain't going to produce a pear if we are supposed to repeat the book of Acts having the same love same mind living in peace one with another do you think these disciples didn't disagree with each other from time to time go back and look at Paul and the disagreement he had over over John Mark the contention was so sharp that they couldn't even speak to one another for a period of time goes to prove there's going to be disagreements in the body of Christ it ain't whether you disagree is how you handle it because even though Paul took a stand about what he felt about that boy he also allowed him to be proven wrong because he come along later and basically said in so many words I was wrong I know I know that's going to take a lot of God to get some of you there hello but that right there is the key to Christianity being able to surrender yourself to God enough to admit when you miss the mark somewhere to be able to say you're wrong that's Christ and a person doing that I misunderstood it I don't see it right it should be this way or that way to be able to say I was wrong that's Jesus Christ in a human heart that make a person be that way absolutely right amen the Serenity and the sincerity of a Christian amen doesn't come from how right they are it's how willing they are to be taught to be corrected by the word we should look at ourselves as Christian lifelong learners we should view ourselves as people who are always learning and coming to a knowledge of the truth amen look at this in the same mind the idea of the same mind you had Moses and Joshua Elijah Elijah you have the great leader being a great follower as well as you've heard me say before great leaders are great followers they follow Jesus Christ let this attitude or beatitude this attitude be in you that was in Christ Jesus same attitude or beatitude speaking the same Paul said and when someone looks at that name Branham don't forget that Abraham was a father of Nations h-a-m means father of Nations and Branham has got some Sons and Daughters here too this is the Canadian portion of them this is a small cross-section of the Canadian bride there's the African bride those in the western Canada and Alberta and Vancouver might be all of these people that make up the body of Jesus Christ we're a small cross-section of just this little part of the body but Branham was able to produce children oh you say I'm no son of brother Branham then I guess Timothy wasn't a son to Paul as Paul said he was he said Titus Timothy and unsummus was sons in the gospel to him you realize a boy who looked looks father a girl that looks like her daddy can't help it you ever heard him say about situations where they're not sure where the boy or the girl come from or something like that and they say oh I know who their daddy is you look right at them and look right at them and you can see that's the daddy they don't even need Maury Povich or some of these guys on those talk shows to tell who the father is amen one thing's for sure you look at me you look at others you know there's a no Rod that big old nose hanging in the middle there amen we all look just like one another the look the features of us amen well if it's the nose and the ears and the look and the approach and all of those things amen that's the same as the father as the mother what should it be for the sons of the message of this hour amen it should be the same purpose the same light the same thought the same love the same purpose everything the vision all of it should be exactly like Father Branham was you didn't see brother Ben I'm throwing people out because he disagreed with him the only time brother man was hard on people about things is when they absolutely became rebellious to the word of God Rebellion is different than disagreement even Paul himself said that he had an evident pattern in his ministry but the man says it's the church age book his first his first sign of a god-given Ministry was that he was true to the word he was unorganized and spirit-led notice and secondly his ministry was the power of the spirit demonstrating not only the spoken or the written word but the spoken word as well and he had evident fruit of a god-given Ministry and the prophet of God said that every God called ministry will have the same thing in them somebody tell me how I could have the same Ministry of Paul if I don't have the same mind as Paul so when you see these men preaching and all they do is just give a good seminar you know right then something is not right they might be a good person they might be a good brother but to be called to preach to be stand behind us that's right here you've got to have these evident things working inside your life too many of these guys get behind this sacred desk right here and they start getting a little favor people like them they like what they talk about and all of a sudden you watch that person he gets him a little group together and he starts pulling that group unto himself that's a spirit of organization listen friend they don't take too much discernment to see who's going to preach camp meeting sometime who's going to preach special meetings it's the same people doing the same thing all the same time and it's the same bunch of the same Ultra doing the same crying and shouting that they did the year before that amen what is that the spirit of organization spontaneous Christian worship not manufacturing it amen and amen praise the Lord this message is not just contained in just a few select Ministries this is a body working together the body of the son of man is made up the revelation of the son of man is made up of every part working fitly together amen without Schism in the body of Christ hallelujah amen a housewife could have the same vision as a preacher matter of fact the prophet of God said that a housewife can do more with the gospel than a preacher can in the Pulpit go look it up that's what he said just because you're a preacher don't mean nothing and the guy is a god you ain't no more and a drunk guy saved five minutes ago that's right oh but how in the world could I ever find my place well find it in Jesus Christ you see if you know that you're a part of him then it's up to him to figure out where you fit I learned a long time ago that I'm not the one working this God puzzle all the pieces are laying out there and all I do is surrender my part to him and he knows where I belong in this whole puzzle if I let him put me in I'll find my place somewhere another amen and I got news for the devil if God ever puts me in ain't nobody can take me out right same with you nobody can hire you nobody can fire you amen glory to God once you're fit in the body of Christ there is no moving that out man not enough Devil's out of hell to take you out of it right listen again the prophet says now God can bless a man a little bit give him a good church but he can't be satisfied until he wants to be ministered to that shows a sign of spiritual sickness it's only the feeble that Jesus ministered to those who desire to be Rabbi doctor Reverend all those selfish ungodly devilish names he said praise God we are brothers we are not of this world but that's what people desire when they come to a meeting or something they walked in with a swelled out chest and carry on you got to have the very highest respects for those people says we don't need no respects one for another if we want any respects I wanted to come from God who gives the true respect how can you have faith when you seek honor one from another brother Benham says it's taken it has taken the hidden power away from the church and it's sapping it away from the people why he said we're trying to act like the world we're not here to compete with the world we're here to preach the gospel somebody helped me this morning amen listen this is why I stood up here last night feeling almost like an orphan at one point I couldn't feel where the spirit was trying to take us until I got to the very end and I told you don't you see the Holy Spirit trying to do that no man lays his hands on you that you take your faith and walk out of here I realize now why he was leading us that way he knew I was going to bring this this morning and I see how it ties in now now listen I can't say too much about backgrounds of this or that I'm just going to say this in a general sense but listen we have leaned in this message too much to the arm of men of reprobate minds or not a reputation I'm trying to say amen and we've almost made ourselves reprobate I'm trying to say Amen by leaning to the arm of celebrities just because they're visual just because they're on the internet just because they got a big church that doesn't mean that God looks on them any different than he does the little guy back in Wyoming that's got about 15 people in the church or whatever comes God regards and esteems all of us the same whether it's the little flocking Kitchener or whether it's the big one over in Vancouver or the one down in Tennessee or the one over in Missouri God looks at us all the same you've heard me say this before but one of the things I've always been criticized for is they say brother Ben what the ministry of the Lords give you you go to them little churches I said you're crazy how do you think I built the ministry I didn't build the ministry if I run out of these big churches out here I preach for every one of them little churches nobody wanted to go to you know why I did it because Jesus didn't call me to preach to a big crowd he called me to preach the gospel amen be it's a few or be at the midi it matters not to me if you see me stand in front of five people I preach just like this right here why because I feel in my heart that the purpose of the ministry is to help whoever God sets in front of you we have such Prestige amongst people you know they walk around and preachers walk around wanting to be ministered to and bragged on now listen I love for you guys to say nice things to me I love to hear you people say that you are blessed or encouraged by things I preached or whatever it may be I love to hear that please don't never stop encouraging me but remember when it comes to God's people we're not to regard one above the other that is the spirit of denomination is that Iran one star in the heaven above can't help how it's made it may not be the North Star it may not make up the Big Dipper it may not be a part of Orion's belt but I'll guarantee if you took all them other scars away from Orion's Belt and you took all the mother Stars away and you had just a Ryan's Belt the big and the Little Dipper it would look like a pretty empty sky and that's what we've done we've taken our little shoot guns in the message and we my dad just called them shoot guns not shotguns we take our little shoot guns and we blow out every Star that we think don't belong there and before long we've just got the picture we wanted to create but when I look at photos and things on the internet of the vast Galaxy and those billions of stars I think to myself not one of them did God blow off the end of his fingers that he ever regretted putting there every one of them had a purpose to make up the family of God amen amen he said if one of them got out of their order he said throw the whole world in chaos amen science brother Adam said would say that those Stars up you understood some of you are seeing they burned out years ago that might be true Luther served his purpose and he went away Wesley served his purpose and he went away amen but they still made up the body of Christ and members said friends they coming why would we be if there wasn't a Martin Luther but if you message people were sitting at a table with him and he ordered a pint of beer rubbed his pipe on his shirt and started smoking his pipe telling you how Antichrist the Jews were what would some of you Believers think about a man like that but you know what God thought about him God winked at their ignorance and he said they don't know any better but given time my bride will know better than that patience the god of patience oh oh yes some big preachers swelling at his chest oh that's so and so oh that's Dr Reverend now you know in this church in this church you could be called every kind of a name when it comes to being a preacher right call you minister they call you any kind of other thing and you know I appreciate people try to show respects but you know you can always tell when the idea behind that is more about lifting the person up rather than the gospel that's being preached right we don't want that kind of spirit honest because remember the Gentile age goes out in the worship of Flesh amen amen [Music] brother I said that's what's taken the hidden power away from the people why because when you start focusing on certain parts of the ministry in certain areas of the body then you lose sight of the rest of them and you know what happens when you start losing inside of all these other things you can do out here it's like I had a wife tell me one time about her and her husband and you know she was always one of these women that want to do the big things for the house you know organize big parties and organize big things you know and stuff like that never to do the little simple things like the cooking and the cleaning and the washing and the whatever more like that and she was always wanting to do the big stuff and he was getting frustrated with her I mean he she was a wealthy woman he'd come home and she'd have a brand new car sitting in the driveway Sam I mean she bought it she didn't steal it maybe I should clarify that much but had all these things going on and you know and this man tells me tears in his eyes he said I just wish she would wash the dishes from time to time but to her it was the big things but listen what brother Adam said the seals he said it's not the big things we try to do it's in little things we leave undone little foxes are what spoils the Vine things work a lot better when people focus on the little stuff that matters you take a small Church you take like hear this Sanctuary here I don't know how many come brother Dale but I mean you you don't have four or five hundred sitting here all the time but you know people look around at empty pews and they get nervous where's everybody at why you know well something must be wrong with his ministry if you don't have a big church maybe God didn't call everybody to sit under him maybe the 15 that God called is the one that God set in there but listen those 15 are a part of a greater number and if you stay focused on your purpose God can multiply that 15 to something else to something else to something else he is still a God that can multiply the fishes and the loaves but in the idea of it oh to have a meeting we've got to have big name brand preachers my daughter used to tell me that a pair of Levi's works the same in the field the same as an old generic version of pants it's the same as the other one does they get dirty just the same amen American Eagle or Outfitters or Levi or or carnhardt or one of those other kind of Brands like our brother got there amen they all get the same dirt on them just the same man again in spoken word Original Seed now listen Brothers said you can only serve God and believe the servants that God sins and you can only serve God on Earth I've read this to you before my word again he said that sin on Earth as God's servants by divine inspiration interpret the word to you so you can only serve God as it's divinely interpreted to you now what a responsibility Brethren that puts on our shoulders to make sure we've got the same vision the same mind the same purpose the same objectives the same goals to deliver it to the body of Christ okay take it out of the pulpit what about your daddies what about you Mom at bedtime whenever it's time to read those babies stories you got to have the same vision that comes from the top all the way down in order for it to be right with God now listen again he says now that's what's the matter of the Pentecostal church tonight too many differences if the church would only be held together and quit fussing splitting up arguing over a little baptism and things should be a lot better off One Church against the other that isn't Sons and God can't trust you Divine gifts are very sacred remember a person could send their soul to hell with one which is what Elvis did by the way so the prophet is using that in order for God to trust us right he looks at our Behavior one to another as a measuring stick of whether he can trust us so if I can't trust you and you can't trust me follow me in tongues and you interpret because you get a little feeling in your heart glory to God I'm not translating that tongue I don't like it God why would you prophesy to a bunch of people you don't like whoa all this Church's getting quiet on me right it's the truth anyways right God wants us to stay in harmony so we can show that we do you know the prophet of God said he would rather you love one another than even love him towards it again he said today the church the reason it's in the condition you want a big class in your church you failed the church is failing to get the prostitute the street walker The Bootlegger and what there is with the city but that's where Jesus wants us to go but you see the kind of model ideal message person member of the church that we want we want somebody that was either raised in the message and backslid from it or somebody that was around the truth for a long time we don't want them people that are brand spanking new don't even understand the word prayer we don't want them people that have no clue how to dress or walk or talk and we almost get offended when somebody comes into the church that has no idea we almost look at them well don't you know what brother said no they don't and neither did you before you knew what you knew come on preach to me now God doesn't want us to have this all-powerful Elite attitude he wants us to be so flexible that if we're talking to somebody that don't know we can come right down to where they are and talk the same languages amen to be able to talk the same language as The Bootlegger talk the same language as the street walker and get right down in their world to be able to have the same mind as them I've known of people that will get out and witness to people saying brother REM said I understand that they have no idea what you're talking about it'd be like if you're an engineer and you come and explain something to me about one of your machines I am not a mechanical person I'm going to smile I'm going to nod my head but know right now I have no idea what you're talking about I still measure like this twelve and two points Sam and I was doing some work in the house I was cutting some trims she said what is it I said 12 and three marks I've been a musician my whole life I don't know much of that stuff we wasn't even allowed to use our hands for anything but the piano when I was a kid my mother almost had heart failure the first time I tried to have my help my dad change the brakes on his car you know it was just the way it was in our home so there's a lot of things I don't understand so if you talk to me about super inflated economics or whatever huh what inside outside only going wow that's interesting man huh I didn't know that is that what they say wow I'm going to be sweet with you but sometimes I don't have no clue what you're talking about neither does the outside world when you try to bring them deep Revelations of God that come from the inner Veil and bring them to the outer cord and try to lead them to Jesus Christ amen how about just help them understand that the Bible is an infallible book how about uh just understand that Jesus loves them no matter what their background is help them understand no matter where they came from God is still a lover of Souls and if we'll have that kind of Mercy on those in the outside world what about those in the church that have come from backgrounds that they don't understand things either everybody's got baggage I said everybody's got baggage and we have to be patient one with another amen labor with one another support one another amen oh hey man and amen he said that's where he desires us to bring them in but we want the guy that's got money that can pay the best and pay off the church debts and things you call it the Upper Crust there's a lot of crust to it he says that's right he said I don't know how much upper it is but a lot of crust but we must go to the hedges highways byways and compel them to come to Christ the outcast that even includes people in this message that have been outcast and the pergament church Age The Prophet said these early Bishops thought they were above the word that's what some preachers are they try to take brother Ram's message to take the Bible and they try to interpret it for the People based on what they think now if we're going to preach the gospel if we're going to take this word and share it with somebody else we must always remember to subjugate ourselves to the star of the age brother I wasn't just a prophet he wasn't just a teacher he wasn't just an apostle an evangelist or he wasn't just a pastor brother Branham was the star of the age and before anything else falls down beneath that star that star is the voice of God it is the he the he the one he that heard the voice of the spirit is that star of the age and what God did with him after that whatever gift he put him out to that fine but is the man that God called first and foremost I don't have an opinion about his opinion if he said it one way say it just like he said it repeat it just as he said it if he said he messed up on it then say it that way amen amen amen but too many times we try to twist the message to fit a denominational taste and the only way you can keep this message straight keep the thinking man's filter on him it'll draw in the life of God you'll draw in the Holy Ghost if you keep the right filter on us praise be to God where are we at now in this particular age this time we're in where are we at it's like this the further we get in time remember Jesus said that there would be an hour that would be called the delay and in the time of the delay that would be the moment brother would be against brother Mother against daughter daughter against father father against son people started fussing and fighting abusing Servants of God my Lord de laeth his coming the attitude changes quickly whenever we get to this spot to where we're not sure if Jesus is coming now or 40 years from now I know some of you might be thinking oh he's going to come any moment we're too late you don't know that neither do I there might be these boys or old men before Jesus comes we don't know that little girl out there could be married and have 10 grandkids of her own before Jesus decides to come back sorry Grandpa we don't know how long it's going to take but we do know this one thing that in the time of testing like this this is not the time to turn our guns one on another folks do you understand that that believe the sign group out there and John Collins and all these critics out there you know the one bit of ammunition they use against us all the time that we are not Unified it's the one thing they've got that they're absolutely right about we are not unified like we should be and I know we get this idea well I've got to stand for my principles do that in the backyard but when it comes to the front yard link arms with your brother and say we are together in this fight that's the way God wants it and then when you get to the backyard pound it out bring your quotes and all your histories and your scriptures and everything and dig in there and find out what's truth but when it comes to the public View what do people see out of us they should see a group completely Unified anointed together in the spirit last statement we're going to close in the book of Acts the Bible said before the Holy Ghost listen these are the first people in all of history in all of creation these were the first people to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost God was going to indwell a human heart for the first time in four thousand years of man's history and before God fed him of the Holy Ghost it said they were in one mind and one Accord and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a Russian Mighty Wind like how it is in a marriage you all just been married for a length of time you know how it is you fuss over the stupidest things sometimes you know I I got two girls now right and Sam and I oh God the fights we've had through the years we've had some good ones ain't we baby we've had some we've had some excellent fights we've had some fights that should go down in wrestling and boxing and MMA history babies of the family always wanting our way one little brat wanting our way we've had some knock down dry gas in our time but that's in the backyard in the front yard nobody better food with her that's my sister I'm her brother and man just like with our children our girls you know how kids are I got some good girls but sometimes they get that little thing on they want to try to play mommy and daddy you know we've won we've always been Unified we've always stood together in the front yard it's always been her and I standing together on a principle of the truth people respect you even though they know you disagree they will respect you if you show that courtesy and that confidence one to another amen and her and I you know we were kids when we got married Lord I was just barely 21 and she just turned 19 and we got married let me tell you something I believe in getting married as young as you could possibly get married I mean as far as like you know don't wait till like 40 or 50 or 16 get married you get married early get married you know I mean if you're 40 or 50 that's fine too but you know it actually helps you if you start in the beginning that way you can get all that child stuff worked out before you start growing up a little bit amen because I'm a powder I know you don't believe that do you I'm a powder I don't get my way I pout I roll that lip out about halfway down in my belly I sit over in a corner and I pout Samantha say what's the matter with you as I'd tell you if I wasn't pouting that's in the backyard but when it comes to the front yard they're not another wing woman that I wanted my sign then my partner in crime back there why that's the kind of love that we've got to have one for another we're always going to be sanding one another don't forget the Bible said steal on steel will sharpen your brother you're always going to be striking them spots where you don't always agree but remember that the attitude of a Christian to be like-minded before we go out of here in the Rapture means that we may not see that eye but we have to have the same purpose and the same vision we're all trying to get to the same place I was singing about a minute ago we're all trying to get to that Heavenly home we want to lift each other up and bring each other to a place to where that if you see one down do you know that in geese Canadian geese do you know when they fly in that formation you know that V style the guy up here in the front here they're always switching around they let somebody else have the lead constantly to arrest each other and do you know that if a goose if it gets hurt one Goose will stay back with it until it gets where it can go on again and then they'll both go together when it's well and they'll join the formation again Hallelujah that's the way it is with the little eaglets when they get down and they get in that molten period where they get crusted over those great Eagles up there some of them Elder Eagles maybe will take that little bits of meat and things and we'll drop it down to them little ones and they'll come over there and they'll pull themselves over and suck the blood out of that meat until they start getting strength and then they'll climb themselves way up high on a rock and start beating the crust out has formed over their eyes and over their wings and they the ones that have the strength they they show favor they they they give their life they they they baby almost in a way of saying they go back and watch over them weaker ones until they get strength to be able to go home oh God how much more should the Bride of Jesus Christ with the holy ghost in my heart how much more if I see you in trouble should I stop what I'm doing and work with you until the Holy Ghost can bring you back up amen amen amen amen amen amen too often we just go on about our business out of sight out of mind it's not my problem let everybody work out their own things but today what Paul said let every mind every man be mindful and mind the things of others in other words not nosy not in your business but be conscious that you may need help you you know to me one of the saddest things in our churches is to hear people backsliding committing suicide getting caught in adulteries and then you'd ask around about how did this happen well we never knew you mean to tell me you went to church or that person for six months a year 12 years 10 years and you didn't see signs that they were in trouble you know why we didn't see it we don't care about each other like we should we figure like Americans everybody should do their own thing and we'll worry about us you worry about you but if I'm called of God that ain't the way even if I if you're good enough to hide it I should have enough relationship with God until I should feel that little funny something moving down in my heart something ain't right there I need to keep my finger on that being sensitive to the Holy Ghost I know it's going to happen anyways but it we should never allow somebody to ever commit suicide in this message we should never let nobody split their marriages up we should never let these kids walk off to the world if we do it it's our failure we can't blame the Bergens we can't blame the Collins this we can't blame vgr we can't blame the preachers we think are responsible we can't blame the church we can only blame ourselves if we're not conscious of what God's doing or what the devil is doing amongst us the prophet of God said the Bride of this last day brother the man he said she'll have the right Spirit to discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit amongst the people how many times that I I've I've pulled people to the side be women sometimes I grabbed my wife or my brother-in-law or somebody there and I pull that sister to the side and I say hey something's going on with you what's up oh nothing oh no I said sister the Holy Ghost is showing me something's wrong and to see many times I've lost count Tears start flowing from their eyes their bottom lips are quivering they're losing their breath hyperventilating brother Ben how did you know it wasn't me the new God was showing me because I care for you how can I help you I'm here as your brother had a brother just the other day going through a hard hard thing nobody knows my wife don't even know this I picked up the phone and I rang him on the phone and I said buddy what's going on with you he said what do you mean I said I'm telling you right now don't you lie to me what's going on with you all of a sudden I heard the other side of the phone wife leaving him this is happening that's happening talk to me I'm here I'm so glad you called he said I told the Lord a few more days I'm going to kill myself but being sensitive being concerned for one another will bring us in such Unity that pyramid that one is supposed to be so fitly put together to you can't razor blade in between you say you're preaching stuff that ain't important hold on you hold your tongue the prophet of God said without perfect love we will never enter that place thus saith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you there what is the Capstone tell me tell me before we get to the Capstone what's that next step before we're capped off brotherly kindness by this shall all men know you're my disciples Hallelujah one form why do people get in trouble in our churches and we have such little discernment that when they backslid on God when they quit the church altogether we see them come in and out of church and they maybe go hide in the back or they leave before the preaching is over with or they sit there with their head down not participating we sit over in a corner and we talk to 12 people about how awful it is and how frustrated we are and we don't know what to do with them I'll tell you what we do make a circle of Love around them get some brothers and sisters together and put a hedge around them and say we know something's going on but we want you to know as a body we love you how can we help you they may absolutely reject you but they'll never forget you're there hey with bomb and Gilead amen if that don't pin it down I don't know what does all of us have those secret things all of us me too we all have those little secret Parts in US that we don't want nobody to know God is such a gentleman that he won't always reveal things like that to people but there is a reason brother sister that the Bible said you that are spiritual when you see a brother overtaken in a phone go to him this is not church discipline this is a brother as a sister in love it isn't a if he don't hear you take another one with you no no no no this is sitting down with your hand open your heart open how can I help you 20 percent if I could even call a number I probably shouldn't even call a number but I have to give some kind of a model of this or it won't make sense 20 of the New Testament as Doctrine will say the rest of it is about how to live how to treat one another you look at Paul's writings what they call the Pauline Gospels Paul will start Ephesians chapter one you're sitting in Heavenly places Christ Jesus predestinated unto a holy walk predestinated in Christ Jesus you were after heard the word of Truth sealed by the Holy Spirit Promise chapter 2 3 4 and 5. he starts dealing with the family loving one another putting away malice getting rid of Envy getting rid of bitterness How To Be Wondering uh husbands love your wives as Christ love the church like last night Christ you know loved and gave himself for the body Galatians chapter 4 when Paul makes that great statement about you are sealed with the Holy Spirit promise unto the daily Redemption go back and read them other verses leading up to it and after that but let all evil speak let all clamor let all filthiness and fornication let all evil speak let all of that be put away from you and love one another John the great disciple amen went away in his 90s and he got to where he couldn't preach brother Jose and the only thing they could do was set him down in a chair they said they put him in a chair and he'd lean up against the wall and he'd holler little children love one another little children love one another I figure a man that had the Revelation The Book of Revelation revealed to him probably had a little understanding about what it meant to be in love hallelujah amen we don't understand maybe the power of it but let me give you a small example of it brother Branham is out hunting with lizard eyes and all he saw was the love of a mother dear go out and give its life for its baby brother man said I turned my head and waited for that shot to go obviously I looked around he was shaking like that he said bill I can't take it no more lead me to that Jesus you've been talking about I don't mind telling you the one thing we've forgotten in all of our doctrines and all of our Prestige and all of our eliteness and all of our live streaming and all of our big fancy doctors and this that and the other all of our big reverends and so we have forgotten one thing the purpose of this message was to fall in love with Jesus Christ the end in the story don't pass go don't go any farther fall in love with Jesus that's the main objective of this message brother Branham did not come so we'd fall in love with him he came so we would fall in love with Christ amen amen amen your whole purpose in life is one thing entertained Jesus Christ and if I love him how'd John say if you say you love God and hates your brother you're still in darkness for he that says he loves God and hates his brother is a liar and the truth is not any not of Cain who is of that Wicked one who had that lady of sin attitude am I My Brother's Keeper well as a matter of fact Big Mouth the answer to that is yes you are and God required his hand at taking Abel's life set a mark on that boy I'd never go well here we are six thousand years later and that same Mark is falling all the way through here to the end time the sword never left his house because why not because of worship not because of preaching not because of a beautiful church or a beautiful order but how he felt about his brother oh God I wish somebody would hear me right now this is the thing God wants out of us right now this is the next step for us here in this province is to start opening our hearts more to those around us how do we not know that the person in your community that you go to that bank every day and you see on a daily basis how do you know that they're not going through some of the hardest things you've ever seen and all it's going to take is maybe you meeting another brother in the bank and you guys start talking and they see the love between you two and they think I want that sisters forgive me for this but the gospel is more than long hair and long dresses the gospel is being able to project thank God for your Holiness but the gospel is being able to project that kind of feeling toward Humanity Jesus said the love of many would wax cold right the only love he said in the last day would be between the elected that's the only love it's going to be left and the only way that you're ever going to make the great is a Christian as if this mind purpose love feeling toward Humanity feeling towards your brother if that dwells in you this is the state the bride will be in before the Rapture comes so if you've got anything in your heart in any way shape form or fashion you know brother Brian told Perry green they were measuring a I think it was the bullet counts or the gunpowder I guess I suppose had a scale that was so sensitive that even a little scratch with a pencil across a piece of paper or just a light little scratch would measure it to some degree and brother Branham told Brother Perry he put a little tiny scratch on that thing so light you barely even see it he laid it on there on that scale measured it he said see brother Perry not even a scratch will allow you to go into that place and yet we have such anger and bitterness and history let me tell you about your history on your web browser when you go into your computer Google you know Google is a doctor he's a pharmacist he's a he's a politician uh he's a lot of things Mr Google is a smart guy he got degrees lined all the way out the wall this guy he's a smart fella he knows mathematics he knows everything except for well how to get the Holy Ghost I haven't been able to find him preaching that one yet but you can go on there and you can say all right maybe a computer getting bogged down a little bit and you got a big bunch of stuff in there and you know all of your recipe hunting and all this kind of stuff you know and somebody said man it's a slow clean out that browser you pull up that little thing on Google and it says when how far do you want to go back I like that little button that says from the beginning of time and all I got to do is go and it will start erasing I wonder what some of you all are doing holding things against one another holding feelings and memories in your heart against things in the past maybe what you need to do is stop clicking two days ago 10 years ago 20 years ago maybe what you need to do is get the Holy Ghost gumption to click from the beginning of time if we draw lines in the sand and hold things against each other tell me where where does that end where is the stop to that you hold even a scratch against somebody that scratch will multiply and replenish itself I'll never have confidence I'll never believe why because you've been so perfect I'll never trust why because you've had everything right oh oh amen you don't have an a man tape in here do you where we could hit the amens Amy play the amen tape for me I'm saying this to you in the name of the Lord Canada not even a scratch will allow you in an entrance into that place whatever you got in your heart you better remember that we are all growing and transitioning we've all made our mistakes and we've all done our stupids cut off somebody preach to me we've all had errors and misgivings in our life times we were misguided and even deceived for a moment of time but God who is faithful you're sitting here today why are you sitting here today because you're still moving in transition you're growing you're learning you're developing you're taking steps forward you're becoming a better Christian a better Pastor a better Minister better wife better husband whatever it may be you're moving on in God's grace and if we don't have that feeling of one another Grace and transition let me tell you what the Bible said Jesus said there was a parable one time of a man that he had kind of like a maybe a little small debt I think one time I looked it up and it was like maybe 50 U.S and the man went over to him and demanded it of him he wouldn't you know he beat him and threw him in jail and all kinds of stuff this other guy and I think I looked this up if I remember correctly I've got it on my notes I'd have to look maybe to get it exact but it's like some 40 billion dollars Jesus uses the example and he said not fella come before the unjust judge and he said I'm going to forgive you of that he said but you didn't forgive this guy over here so how am I going to forgive you of this right here he said whenever he owed him he said he took him by the throat and said pay me what you owe and Jesus used this as an example that no matter what your brother does or sister does don't hold debts against them don't hold things against them don't hold debts in your heart forgive them forgive them for everything they may have said or done you don't know what history in their browser caused them to do it complexes abuses living with narcissists living with fears maybe being beaten maybe being dominated maybe being micromanaged maybe being lied to maybe being deceived or maybe they just had an old evil spirit on them you don't know what's in somebody's history and why they choose to do what they do and thank God we're not the judge of that because we'd be in a bigger mess than we are right now come on somebody preached to me I'm trying to wind it down but I'm going to stop when the Holy Ghost tells me to you just hang in there with me because I feel the Holy Ghost has been expressingly very poignant about this this weekend let me tell you I had no intention of taking these quotes this direction but here we are good bad or ugly here it is this is what God's time to say to us and we need to follow the moves of the Holy Spirit and you precious people anytime the Lord's ever used me to speak like this to you you have obeyed those words of God and you've marched on with them I compel you to listen to the holy spirit this morning and let God let all of you turn a corner and move into higher Heights and deeper depths I met a person many years ago that they were the most ridiculous human being they made the stupidest decisions I used to think man oh man this guy what is a matter to get a little frustrated I I say why do you do what you do just ridiculous stuff extend it for an hour and tell you some other foolishness I saw this guy one day we were sitting in the back of a pickup truck I've been out working with him we got went by to Sonic it's one of these little drive-ins back home we got a big old drink like this and we were sitting back here in the back of the truck talking and all at once he started weeping at 10 years old he was molested by a cousin a knife held to his throat a gun put to his head and made to perform sexual acts his daddy was so abusive to him that one day as a little boy six like this little fella right here put his hands into the trunk to try to help Daddy get some groceries out and he slammed the trunk down on his fingers and when this boy started crying mama said get him out of there get him out of there and his dad said it serves him right for putting his hands where he didn't belong and walked off this guy spent two hours brother Gord telling me most horrific things I've ever heard in my life out of one human being's life and I've been around the world and I've preached to thousands of people I've never heard a story as rough and as hard as this kid was and then he's dyslexic he's got ADHD he's got all kinds of other little complexes he's got childhood PTSD he's got adult PTSD and when he told me his story I began to understand that was what was motivating all of the decisions he'd made in time I felt like an absolute scumbag and I promised God on that place I'll never bring judgment to another person until I know their story because you don't know what you don't no that's where we should have such Mercy what about God who does know your history how does he behave towards you when you go to pray to him or worship him like you have this weekend in the morning as he looked down on us and say God am I sight you bratty kid he opens his arms to us and Jesus treats us as though we're a brand new baby amen amen amen he don't cast us out he don't correct us he don't yell at us or with us he opens his arms and says come here John come Daddy's here to help you glory to God hallelujah he doesn't put his foot on anything you low down thing what does Jesus do he Stoops himself down and he gets down and he talks our talk just like you do these little babies you know this one's still scared of me a little bit I'm big I'm scared I gotta turn her head but give brother Ben some time let me get in her world a little bit hello and I've watched them do it in those Chinese kids they come on and they're scared of us Americans you know and I'll start laughing joking I put a puppet up and make some kind of a voice I get in their world and all of a sudden I'm the best teacher they've ever had why I could talk to him up here Jose and I both are doctors education you know what it is brother you could stand and use language that people wouldn't understand you did it in your schools or studies but when I'm talking to a common farmer a painter or somebody I talk their language I'm not bragging on me I'm trying to tell you that's what Jesus does for us God help me say this next bit he speaks your broken language of PTSD he speaks your complex language he speaks your language of fear he speaks your language of hurt he speaks your language of anxiety he speaks your language of being burdened he speaks to drug addicts talk he streaks the prostitute's language he speaks on your lover he gets Right Where You Are he gets right down where you are and talks just like you are I'm mad who doesn't read could you imagine God could talk in such a way we wouldn't understand nothing he ever said or did but even when he come to the Earth he talked to come and talk that's why they couldn't translate him for many years they're trying to use big words Jesus didn't talk like that he taught like a bill hilly that's hillbilly back in Tennessee he taught like one of the Common People the regular people he didn't speak with a highly as I heard barter Brothers sermon you imagine those Jews will be saved over there watch him when he shows up to Israel they said where did you get those scars he talks their exact talk in the house of my friends when he got there amongst those Pharisees Simon you know when he put him in the corner with dirty feet Simon I got something I want to tell you he talked just like Simon talked but when that little woman got down at his feet she was anointing him for his burial and that lady brought an adultery he just wrote down in the sand a little while he listened at him cackling clock in carry on like a bunch of chickens in the barnyard he that's without sin let him throw the first stone I think it was for the eldest to the youngest or youngest eldest each one just started walking away there's under such condemnation look at him woman where are your accusers at he can look to her and said now you're Justified as though you never did it in the first place Hallelujah the revelation of the seventh seal it's all been before your eyes he just talked regular talk so she can understand him glory to God he got right in her world and condescended to her estate he didn't break into the revelation of Thunders he didn't break into the revelation of the godhead he didn't say now woman do you understand that I'm not the Eternal son do you understand that I came from Glory that I am the lamb slate he just said where are your accusers at you could have said a whole lot more you know but he reserved all of that for another time he took what was important and he ministered to her at that time if we're ever going to get anywhere as a body of Christ that's the kind of mind that has to be in US that was in Christ Jesus stand with me let's bow our heads together now just a moment musicians before you play while you're standing there with your heads bound this morning lot's been said I've certainly taking you down many Avenues and places without a doubt there's been enough said here almost this morning to be able to hit any one person no matter where they come from but while you're standing here with your heart focused on the Lord with your head bow and eyes closed now I want you to think you know your heart you know what's in there does it take the hurt away of what people do no do you still remember when people has done or did or whatever they just some kind of past thing sure you remembered all the days of your life other parts of you that just can't forget that molestation or can't forget that rape or can't forget that drug life or that life of alcohol or addiction or just that church history that you come from or the way that Pastor treated you or whatever it might have been no you probably won't ever forget them things when Paul said in the book of Philippians to forget those things which are behind Paul wasn't telling us that we would never remember it but what he's telling us folks is that those memories have power over your destiny today or tomorrow when you forget it you nullify it you make it void you take away its power from influencing you today or tomorrow that's what forgetting means I had a sister say to me one time after preaching this brother Ben I was horribly raped and beaten to death nearly how could I ever forget such a thing I said sister it's not that you'll ever forget it but the power of the person that was possessed of a spirit in such a way drawn after their own lust and things to do such a horrific thing to you that memory will probably always be with you but Christ can give you the ability to never let that dominate or influence your walk with God except to be in a positive way in some manner but the negative of it can be taken away nullified void May rendered completely powerless in your life as you're standing here you got history in your browser Now's the Time to pull up your heart before God and say God wipe it back to the beginning of time clean me out delete those hidden files delete those cookies in my life delete those little tracking things that they put in there all that unseen hidden stuff because you see in every memory there's another little package of memories underneath those memories that you don't even remember sometimes certain things associated with it when somebody goes through trauma there are certain parts of their mind that it's so heavy they can't remember certain aspects of it that's your mind's way of keeping your sanity because to remember that head-on like that might be too much for you to drive you crazy like the twins brothers talked about the one girl could not take the pressure of that and it drove her human Spirit out of her she went crazy so brother Brian said it took me days to find that human Spirit bring it back to the girl said she couldn't take the pressure being made fun of as a Christian or whatever she was a twin her other twin said oh forget it they don't want to serve the Lord let them jump on a river but this other girl couldn't handle it it's too much for him there were hidden things secret things in her that maybe she didn't remember herself but you click that little button from the beginning of time God would erase and take away all of the Power of even them hidden things you don't remember you don't need Psychotherapy you don't need a psychotherapist or a psychiatrist or somebody with that kind of persuasion to sit down and talk to you about whether your mom and dad was mean to you at some point in your life Christians you're going to have to start taking power and take authority over these things that plague you your entire days now is that time as I told you last night I tell you again in the name of the Lord like that boy brother said he's always looking for a place to put his feet on the start and he said now is that place son I'm telling you in the name of the Lord Now's the Time if you want to step up higher Now's the Time put your feet down start walking like a real Christian should walk amen I don't know what your browser looks like it's not my business to get in there and look into your history and things God who knows the end from the beginning he knows how to wash us away for what can wash away my sins let's sing that together while you're standing there in prayer

flow that makes me wide as snow snow [Music] found I know nothing but the blood I'm thinking of a church now not long ago there's some saints standing here this morning that the number of years ago the Lord sent me out there and they had all kinds of Divisions and things amongst them the holy ghost prophesied that night to him if you don't have Unity if you don't let things go forgive one another bind together and these Saints they know who they are and they know what I'm talking about is you're going to lose out God of his wife is think completely I I just got you know that this little church they're not even moving on in Jesus Christ let me tell you something brother God don't want us harboring feelings toward one another if your browser is clean this morning then keep it that way and now I'm going to open it this way you might say looking for an altar call that's where things are done no no the position of your body here has nothing anymore to do than the position out there it's your attitude toward this word right here now let's sing it again you got something in your heart to make right with somebody you go over to them and you get them by the hand and you say I want to repent I want to tell you I'm sorry forgive me I want to make this thing right I want to get it out of the way and while we're singing this is what happened in that little church some years ago I told him go to one another to make things right whatever it may be you go get him by the hand and say brother sister I want you to know I'm sorry you don't have to get into a long drawn explanation when you click that thing on the browser it just wipes it out you don't have to explain yourself just say I'm a better Christian today than what I was and I know I may not have done like I should have but I'm repenting I want you to know I'm your brother your sister I love you and I want to be right with God you've got something to make right you go make it right while we sing again what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me hold again nothing but the blood of Jesus [Music] oh precious is that flow that makes me what a snow God bless some of you moving that's real Christianity that's what makes real Christians oh precious is the flow that makes me wide as snow no other found I know nothing but the blood of Jesus let's do it one time without

snow [Music] nothing but the blood of Jesus nothing but the blood of Jesus haha oh Hallelujah [Applause] now the reason I do that it ain't that I don't like these musicians play but I know how hard they work sometimes they need just a few moments to be able to worship themselves they're always the business in the service of the Lord I like to give them breaks from time to time so thank you little time with Jesus too oh any wonderful to us I love your friends I hope after all the years I've been with you you don't think me to be mean or cruel or hard or mean-spirited in some way and I know for an evangelistical sermon this is probably one of the worst examples of an evangelist sermon to get ever been given and not going to apologize for the leadership of God and I want you to know as much as it may be completely off of the regular run of what maybe in evangelist you remember the Bible said in evangelist is to reprove and rebuke with all long-suffering and Doctrine that's what I did this morning and I know be on a shot of a doubt that if we listen and obey I said we now we me too we listen and obey to these things that's being preached and listen to what the word said to this morning I believe God will bring great changes in every one of us amen [Music] now maybe you didn't move at the end of the service maybe there's just a big whale in your way you know maybe maybe maybe uh maybe Captain Ahab can't see nothing but the whale there but don't let that well kill you you got days coming you got time coming maybe it may be better a cup of coffee sitting at a table that's fine I just do what I feel compelled to the Lord to do but you let that word affect your life maybe you say I Don't Care About Us in the past but the Bible said if you think your brothers got ought against you you go to them and talk to them imagine imagine what kind of people we can be if when we come in behind those doors that we realize it's okay to be disagreeable with one another it's okay to not always agree but to still look at that person and feel in your heart I don't agree with them certain things they do I wish to God they wouldn't do it but that's my brother that's my sister you know brother Branham said church now you listen to me Ontario brother Branham said when the people get in that kind of spirit of love he said then the gifts of the holy spirit will pull right into the body of Christ and he said when those gifts start Milling through the body he said Milling he called it Milling through the body and start working out there amongst the body of Christ he said then let sin enter into the camp he said the holy spirit will call it out right quick you see for years we have placed that responsibility upon the man that stands behind this desk up here but it is not always the preacher's responsibility to call out sin it's yours and not even sin but he said what if a woman with a red hat come in the bank she's dying of cancer the Holy Ghost fall on the place thus saith the Lord you stole a candy bar or something when you was fine go make that rhyme and God will heal you that cancer what kind of a help what kind of a government could we be if we had that kind of love and that kind of unit I may never live to see it in its fullness but God I'll do everything I can to sow it into the people I preach to I love him I love him because he first loved me I just can't say no more I I'm out of words I keep talking the way I'm talking I I'm going to break over in another language and you won't understand me anyway let me explain this to you the Holy Ghost is so rich and so thick on this platform right now that I'm telling you if there's ever been a time I know God's pleased I can feel the pleasure of the Holy Spirit our Papa's pleased with us today he's proud of us and he's pleased with the attitude that we've seen exhibited here today as long as you keep that you watch God just keep taking you higher and higher and higher I love you friends pray for me and I'm gonna pray for you okay ah love him because he first love me bless you my brother appreciate you God bless you I want to keep your picture with me [Music] um [Music] amen amen thank you Lord Jesus

complete Angels you know I want to remind you know brother Ben preached it everything it was just beautiful you know the only difference between our Believers is our calling and position that's it our calling position you are no different than the prophet brother exactly that's right it's calling and positions man the youngest believer in here the the housewife amen you know the Bible says when they came the kids came to Jesus he said unless we become as children you know if children didn't walk by nine or ten months you would take them to a doctor sure because children walk and if your kid didn't talk by about a year you would take them to a doctor man so children talk so you know and man we we we have respects in the in the sanctuary and we've had them but children talk yeah yeah and
