they're part of us and and just love you and appreciate the church and I mean I want to publicly say I I thank God for just the relationship you can have with him man just had a a wonderful week fellowshipping with God man and just the Revelation and I just feel like I just feel like he was brand new almost just things that he showed me I don't deserve just beautiful amen and I Pray by his grace that we can share them together amen but I'll tell you something you're serving a magnificent God man he is he is literally more than your mind can comprehend and uh we just pray something man Praise Him amazingly you know you know I want to say this before we turn to our text you know I mentioned in communion that God operates in a period of time I'm going to show you more of those periods of times and God always shows himself first before judgment and you know the same angel that came to Peter and the people were healed by saddle was the exact same angel that came to Paul and they were healed with handkerchiefs and it can be the exact same God that comes to you when the preacher and the word Goes Forth and you're sitting in your seat brother Brown said that he said that was the Gentile way the Jews way was laying on of hands but God's bride had more faith amen and I it's it's just this Bible it literally just exploded to me this week and I just feel overwhelmed and and blessed and and I'm going to try to portray that to you this is probably part one of probably part three at least at least part three of the Gentile dispensation and the bright time the Gentile dispensation in the bright time let's turn to Daniel 12. 4 8 and 9 just to save time and I want to show you and and different things that and I have messaged things I might read some quotes at the end but you know the two books of the Bible that are the greatest book if you're part of the Bride this morning it's Daniel Revelations because both of them were who God is not in the written form do you know and this is oh I I got to read my scripture I'm going to start preaching amen but thou Daniel shut up the words seal the book even to the time of the end for many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be greatly increased Oh Glory let's go to eight just let's go to eight sorry you can read this all but let's just jump to eight and then tonight verse 8. and I heard but I understood not and I said and then said I O Lord that what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed Until the End Lord Jesus we we surely invite you in this place it would be a great disappointment Lord if your beautiful Holy Spirit wasn't here and we pray for your anointing to fall on us not just the speaker Lord Jesus but I pray this morning more than ever before that your anointing would fall on the hearer and may they see Christ magnified in its bright and the the Mysteries how they are gone in our day and it was sealed up until our day and Lord Jesus we just pray that you you will help the speaker to show and the revelations of Who You Are to your bride in your name we pray amen amen God bless you and you may have your seat see so we need to have open minds when I say open minds I don't mean to break the word of God or or to uh come outside the word of God but you see how God came to Peter and Peter had so much of God that the people just walked by him as the sun shined on them and they were miraculously healed and you would think well God's exactly the same yesterday today and forever and that he is but God came to a different vessel and the exact same God in the exact same Holy Spirit took a handkerchief and prayed over it said take this home and lay it on your sick one they'll be made well there's so many times this morning we miss God because we put them in a box and we say well my God can't do this and if you believe that he can't amen oh it's so magnificent you know the prophet said when Daniel went in the Lion's Den it wasn't Daniel that kept the lions from meeting him it wasn't his prayer it wasn't that they had fed the dyings before because that wasn't the truth it was the pillar of Fire the same pillar fire that was over brother bram's head was actually tabernacled in Daniel and lions are afraid of Fire and you say well how could that be that the Lions would be afraid of Fire and that same fire would be in Daniel and all over Daniel to the point that the Lions could see it and smell it but I want to burn Daniel I'm glad you asked because that same pillar of a fire came in a bush to a prophet named Moses and he looked on upon it he looked upon God Christ and he said I can't understand why this bushes are burning up God God's showing himself to us in the pillar of Fire and you'll see this so much through the scriptures so much through the scriptures you know we're part of the Gentile age the gentile people and I'm sure glad I am I'm glad that I don't have to go through the tribulation and be a part of the foolish virgin because I'm a Jew amen I want to show you something this morning we've heard preachers our whole life tell us the Christ is coming remember the period of time he is coming but I'm going to show you today in the scriptures and with our prophet that he is as much here right now today this morning as he'll actually be when he comes in his Corporal body and a rapture he won't be here no more and the Bible says that in Revelation 10. oh it's beautiful see the Gentiles were EX -propriated kicked out of Israel because Israel was God's chosen people you'll see when Jesus came and the Gentile lady came to him Jesus himself said it's not me that I should give to dogs brother Dale this morning at that time was considered cannon fodder can you imagine and you know we can look and maybe we'll pull it up and I'm just going to paraphrase it you can show the scriptures but if you go to Romans 11 5 and 5 to 7 and then Romans 11 and I'm just going to read what I have down paraphrase so I'm not going to read the scriptures exactly but because the Gentiles fell salvation came to us and in verse 20 he says well because of their own belief they were broken off you know how it talked about the tree and the actual natural Branch God took off this is Romans 11 and 20. but because of you Believing by faith he said and the end of that verse he said but don't never get high-minded but fear because the same God that took out the natural branch could take out the grafted in branch amen if we raised ourselves up got high-minded in on belief and in verse 21 it says for if God spare not the natural branches take heed lest he spare also not thee and in verse 22 he says in in Romans 11 but he said behold therefore the goodliness of God to you and the severity of God to them that fell in unbelief severity to those to to unto them but goodliness unto thee if you continue in his goodliness that's his belief otherwise thou also shall be cut off God help us God's God has a plan amen and we see in the Bible you know God will never cut off his true bride and the reason he'll never do it is because she's a part of him it's beautiful amen and so we see that Abraham in the Bible was a gentile in and Abraham was God came to Abraham the beginning of see you know God came to his own and his own re received them not and so God left his eyes off the Jews they were blinded for a period of time so he could put his emphasis on the Gentiles and here in Daniel we know that Daniel was a Jew this is a paradox get this Daniel was a Jew but he was the first prophet to the Gentile age a Jew but a prophet to the Gentile age and here God came to Abraham and said get thee out of thy country and from the Kindred and from thy father's house and I'll take you to a land that I'll show you that's in Genesis 12 1. and we know in that that that uh Vision that God came to Abraham that prophecy that came to Abraham that that was the type of the Holy Ghost the Our Land our land that God's going to show you is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we know that Abraham was not blessed until he completely separated from the world if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God cannot even be in you and the Bible talks about people that will not willing to leave your mom or your dad or your family or your town or your kindred for Christ Jesus and we know that in the Bible we're clearly a part of Abraham and we would call Abraham Our Father Abraham and spiritual scene Hallelujah and in this season Amen in Isaiah 61 Isaiah 60 and 1. it talks about he says arise and shine for your light has come and the Lord Jesus Christ it took his eyes off the Jews and it's made a shine on a gentile days and so we see when it came in the beginning and here when Daniel wrote the first book of Revelations he wrote Revelations before Revelations was wrote by Vision amen it's beautiful and it Revel what happened in Daniel exactly happened parallel some in some cases almost word for word verses and Revelation as God picked up as John as God gave the Same Spirit to John and he wrote it years later oh Hallelujah election the only election was part of the Bride the Gentiles saved by grace and but I want to show you something in this and the prophet talks about it in the seals and I I got some some some oh it's just beautiful amen Hallelujah but the Gentile dispensation started in a mystery and the reason it was a mystery is Daniel seen the Gentile dispensation from beginning to end our Prophet said that I had the quote where he says it I'm like and see God showed that all to Daniel before it happened and he said but brother Dale ain't been born yet Brothers here in Wyoming sisters haven't been put here yet born yet and he said seal it up because they're in my mind see the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world you were either there or you never will be there oh it's beautiful amen so here the Gentile ain't started in a mystery and and it was sealed up until the end but in this time you are a privileged people and in this time time will be no more amen you now watch this remember I said that time space of time you now I'm going to show it to you I'm going to prove it to you in the Bible the prophet you right now are living in eternity but you're not but you are you are your flesh isn't but you are watch whether watch all the scriptures and we're going to watch see you're a special class of people oh it's beautiful right let's look at this where Paul talks in second Corinthians 12 3 and 4 he said I knew not such a man whether in the body or out of the body I can't even tell by God knoweth and verse 4 he says but how how that he was caught up into paradise and heard the Unspeakable words sealed up which was not lawful for a man to utter because Wyoming hadn't happened yet the bride of Christ from around the world that hadn't all happened yet amen now Paul could not speak of it because it was unlawful and ball Paul wrote 14 books of the Bible but he couldn't tell you what he could tell you he couldn't tell you what he knew to tell you because the space of time that God was dealing in it it was at the beginning of that space of time and it hadn't come to pass yet but those things have all changed now oh it's beautiful Revelations 1 and 19. let's turn to that Amy here John writing he said write these things which thou has seen and the things which are God and which the things which should be Hereafter Revelations 19. here's God coming to John when he's on the island Apartments he said write it down but it was sealed because it wasn't the time let's just jump ahead in God's timepiece a phrase now let's go to Revelations 10. one to seven Hallelujah oh this is beautiful I I pray to God you'll get this amen Revelations 10 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud the church that's my message let's close and go home that verse tells you everything you need to know about the next four messages the mighty Angel was Christ and the John wrote Revelations but but who told them to write what he wrote God on the island of Patmos and he came down in a if you come down in a not now see what I said earlier I said he will be no more here when he comes in his Corporal body and we leave this earth then he is here today in our age and I'll read you some quotes at the end of the message that say that matter of fact I'll read them right now Revelations chapter 5 in the second paragraph in 61 here he says he says the days were finished and time had run out it was all over and time shall be no more the time of the mysteries of God we're over that's right now suckbook right now I'm just reading it in the quote the parts that I got highlighted and we're right now we're right now in the front yard if you want to know where this is found this is Revelations uh message uh paragraph 101 6106 18. he says we're right now in the front yard and he said here is them in Revelations 10. oh well that's what we got up on our screen and here the angel come down and he put a foot on the land and he put a put a foot on the sea and you know God is just amazing you know what the prophet said that God did when he put his foot on the land and put a foot in the sea it was stopping the spirits of Satan that would stop the move of God he had control of the land and he had control of the water and he was Jehovah Jireh oh it's beautiful Hallelujah and he said time had run up it's over it's over oh don't fear see God is Elohim and see he knows what's going to happen tomorrow keep that in mind it's over but he still knows what's happening see the Bible says he said see green not the Holy Spirit whereby ye are sealed sealed sealed unto till when until it's over until your day of redemption so in God's mind it's already eternity amen now if you go to Romans 8 and I I'm jumping way out here so you got to help me come back but in Romans 8 about 20 I think it is it said those that he called he chose and he predestinated and he elected I'm not at the end of the verse it gets you really good all those people now who did that not brother Dale not a good evangelist but all those people that he predested me he chose called and he liked Ed that he already already past tense if you get this you're going to be really happy past tense he already glorified you what what you're all ready in God's mind it's already over is already in God's mind eternity it's already over it's completely over you're just like it's like it's like a play that you're playing in but you've already read the book there's no climax to the story because you already practice in the I don't mean that there's no climax but you see you already know see God because he's Elohim oh and this is no religion man this is this is Jehovah himself Hallelujah and Diamond ran out in the redempt Redemption is over and now he's coming as a lion the tribe of Judah and he was the lamb but now he comes as the lion is the tribe of Judah oh and here's where people God help me to explain this and there's more I'm going to commit this morning but this is where people go off brother Brown said that in in The Sixth Seal I'm going to give you lots of stuff and I'm going to read both sides brother Brown said in the Sixth Seal that Christ got off The Mercy Seat and walk to take Redemption and it was finished it's finished and you're saying whoa what about Brenner but what about your loved ones don't worry remember what we said unless you came to unbelief Jesus came to his own and his own refuse to not what was it on belief they never believed that he was Jehovah they believed he was illegitimately born from Mary and Joseph scripture thank you thanks for asking uh I thought his dad was a carpenter huh that's how they believe and the Bible says here when we write in Corinthians if you believe the same way the same thing will happen to you that happened to them he took a saw and he cut them off the tree so remember your unsaved loved ones and Brenner all you have to do is believe it because he said to the Jailer for you and you have to your household you say well how does God compare the house your household is as big as your house wants to be oh it's oh man you could just lose your mind preaching this hey man and see he said he said now then the lamb took the book and the four beats and the Four and Twenty others fell down and washed up the land the greatest thing we should be doing at this time in this time of Eternity is we need to be losing our mind worshiping God and I don't mean and show and I don't mean fake garbage and that I mean in genuine you're just locked out it's like horse blinders and you don't know who's beside you and who's in front of you and a semi car could go by you and you wouldn't even know it because you're just like wow and worship and now at this time everything must this is this that's what he said paragraph 20 102. he said now at this time for you the bride everything must be worshiped wow now remember and accept that now don't you let us miss that now listen close when all the mysteries of the church are finished and when all the Mysteries of the plans of redemption are finished and the Seven Seals are open right immediately after this now look and the time for everything in heaven and everything on Earth watches and when the seals were opened everything in heaven and everything in Earth worship God amen everything hallelujah amen now watch what takes place unless he said they sang a new song worthy are worthy listen to the worthy worthy are you Lord amen Jared didn't even have a clue what I was preaching but songs were just beautiful and going along with our thought amen today it was just amazing see how this was in Revelation 7. now let's just move on Amen so he came down from having clothes in the cloud and a rainbow was upon his face on his upon his head and his face was as it were the son and his feet and his feet remember I talked about fire and his feet kept the Lions away from Daniel uh we're Builders a buyer Hallelujah verse two Hallelujah and he's and he had in his hand a little book open and he sat the right foot upon the Sea and the left foot upon the Earth but see God was saying when he did that that I'm God you're gonna read it and I'm in control if your loved ones are living on the earth brother he's got her under control and if they're a lifetime seller and they never touch land he's got that under control too whoa oh it's good and he crowd with the loud voices one the lion roarth and when he had cried Seven Seals opened oh and don't say that but that's what happened because Thunders is voices Thunders is The Voice of seven Thunders uttered their voices next verse amen these are the Seals opening in our day you know what happened before the seals open you know what happened before the seal could happen we just read it first verse and God himself came down it's recorded in Revelations but seal it up until the end we've arrived we're past tense arrived that happened already and I'm going to read the quote where the Prophet said how he came down it was sealed up in our day and when the seven Thunders utter their voices and I was about to write what the seal said I Heard a Voice in heaven saying unto me seal it up for those things which are the Seven Seals seven Thunders Thunders are voices utter thundered said hide the seals but as in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God the mysteries of this Bible the mysteries of marriage and divorce the mysteries of the godhead the mysteries of water baptism I will do all things as I reveal it to my servants the prophets the mysteries of thee no eternal hell the mysteries of you are eternal and on and on and on and and write them not next verse oh Hallelujah and the angel that I saw stood now this is Christ and Christ that I saw upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up His Hands to Heaven oh now our Prophet said that I couldn't say that if we didn't have a prophet I have a backup plan okay but even our Bible will tell us next verse and he swear by the prophet not by the angel who came to Abraham who did Abraham fall down and said my Lord my God who did light see angels oh isn't this beautiful it's it's just unbelievable and he swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created who who created the heavens and the things which there are in and the Earth and the things that there are in are you getting the picture I just see are the things that there are in that there should be that they should be I helped me preach for somebody that there should be time time no more who don't operate under time brother Dale operates a time got to get that I gotta I gotta my god Jehovah God there's one moment as is a thousand years God oh my who was this angel that put his hand under the sea they the world don't know it but you know it because God came down not just and even of the South but he sent a prophet and he said I I hid it I hit it amen oh Church let me just tell you something this ain't a boat brother Dale this ain't even I mean it ain't About You pacifically it's about Christ and a bride and then end time and this is I'm telling you what you weren't born here to make money you weren't born here to build a nice house you weren't you were born here you came here for two reasons one to worship God and God to prove to Satan that God wouldn't bow to Satan oh oh Hallelujah time should be no more I want to tell you something this morning you are in eternity and everything you need you could speak it if you'd believe it only believe the password is only believed only believe only believe all things are possible do you know in our modern day technology there's things on your phone that you may not have but you could connect to somebody else's phone and do a jumper off it called the internet or called technology God had that a long time ago amen because if you don't have enough Faith to believe for your loved ones your loved ones don't have enough but God said to the Jailer that if you believe brother Matt or brother Jared if you believe it don't even matter that they don't even realize they're not believing but if you would believe and you would believe that they could jump or cable you and you would give enough Faith to them to the unbeliever that it would be all they would need to be an eternity wow what did God tell the prophet all that you loved wow all that you loved will be that we need to fast forward our God in our own life because he I I got to read let's see what the prophet said and Shalom 64. he said the Seven Seals were revealed before the great mystery of light and Tucson Flagstaff and brother friend and other brother Fred and other brothers were there you know what that was God come down Revelations 10. amen and he took he said I it was prophesied months and months ahead and I'm just he said a blast went off not knowing what would take place and he said the hands and the time was at hand and the Seven Seals which were held the seven Mysteries uh listen to me Church of the entire Bible were sealed up and those Seven Seals every mystery ever there's a few in there we're all sealed up in the seventh seal amen and the angel came down the road the messages and the church ages and opened a certain part of it but the seventh hour the seventh messenger and all these Mysteries should be finished because time it let me just rephrase this it's not just time is no more right now it hasn't been no more since 64. now if you're wondering about Grace I wasn't born in 64. but I was born but I wasn't born you couldn't see me but I was there I seen the cloud but I didn't see the cloud I was in the cloud I wasn't outside of the department I'm just jumping ahead on this film you everybody's welcome to these quotes the prophet said he swore by himself the time should be no more and therefore he broke forth on the lives forever and ever and time should be no more but he broke forth on those Seven Seals to reveal them that's when he came down when he came down before the seals in the cloud Revelations 10 and broke the Mysteries from that time forward we've been in eternity watch this and he said and time shall be no more and therefore he broke forth those Seven Seals and revealed them and he showed the uh oh I can't even say that word the The Marvelous things that he showed he showed them in the heavens first there's a word here I can't say I'm forgive me for my they showed that the Magnificent things he showed he showed in the heavens right before you were born he showed it let me say let me show you what he says and that day the world took pictures of it all across Southern United States and Mexico you didn't think you were living in eternity and there it hangs thou in Life Magazine still a mystery to them but he declared it in the heavens watch watch this now let's go back to our scriptures Revelation 10 just in our memory did it not say the time would be no more in Revelations uh 10 6. the end of the verse and he said but he declares it in the heaven before he does it here and he always does that because he shows his signs in the heavens first and then he says look out here I'm coming Jehovah God let me show you something how God operates oh it's beautiful Josh Joshua around Jericho walls seven times why Grace you thought he just was following God's orders wow Grace Noah went in the ark God shut the door did it rain but she couldn't have guessed so many days Grace again I would tell you something this morning you know what there's Revelation in God's word that's not written I never knew that until this week you say brother Dale you're walking right on the edge and you might not be a word preacher anymore would you like an example of the scripture well I I can't believe all the things God showed me this week God used Elijah to get Rebecca you brother Matt you brother Bernard brother Frank did he did it just help me out somebody help me preach he came to Eliezer to get Rebecca and he said to God he said now if she's the one tell her to give me a drink and then water my camels is that true but what did Eliezer Tell Rebecca I'll help you he said give me a drink he did not say what he told God and Rebecca in Revelation to Jehovah God said and I'll Water your camels also that was eroded the word oh that's unbelievable he never said that to Rebecca oh that's exactly what he's doing to Rebecca today wow and that's not leaving the word of God either wow what did the prophet say about butter reap between the lights oh thank you Lord and he always does it in the heavens before he shows it on Earth and he goes in and talks about the Zoe and all these things and the message alone God Jehovah and it ain't Because of You pacifically or me pacifically but it's because of us specifically you get in my picture I ain't married to make me some big big Macho nothing and I ain't trying to make you some big nacho about it but the bride of Christ together collectively around the world and every country in every tribe in every nation is a big deal oh oh man we have to catch this soon because we're not going to be here very long it's finished and everything that you think you're going to get in heaven you could get right here if you just believe so when you would connect to a non-believer and they would connect to your faith like Technologies trying to become you don't think technology is trying to imitate God Santa Claus Knows What You Want For Christmas no we don't Jesus Does Hallelujah Satan is a liar my phone if I start looking at praying for the Believers in Mexico by the way they're they're having Civil War you know if I was watching videos on Mexico the next video is videos because they already know what I'm thinking about that's not God this is God time is over we're living in eternity verse 6. oh did I read this Amen in verse 7. that's realist so God sweared by himself see when God wanted to do a New Covenant with the Gentiles and give a promised seed son Isaac he didn't send an angel wow the Bible says as an angel but there was an angel they don't want me to tell you something else that ego that angel wasn't a beacon either that angel Abraham and Sarah cook meat for it and it ate red meat hello he turned it I already mentioned Revelations 8. predestinated called Justified and this is wrote past tense those people he's already glorified he also glorified past tense it's not like well if I'm a good boy and I don't steal a cookie from Grandma's house that when the Rapture comes no glorified past tense oh my goodness Ephesians 4 30 is where it says grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby ears sealed to the day of your Redemption see the book the book was sealed but it's open now 64. the Mysteries were revealed really be in our day but before our day and our age and the Mighty God has revealed himself to you and to me and he's come down and church we need to quit living like humans and we need to start living like the bride of Christ it's not maybe perchance if I'm lucky oh garbage seventh the seventh seal the seals were revealed but the seventh seal deals with even when the prophet revealed the seventh seal it's wrote even when he revealed it to some make believe in Bride some don't even believe it's revealed the Bible says it is our Prophet was here to reveal it it's revealed it's revealed who he and she is notice how I said that because you can't reveal he without she it's revealed who he and she is and it also our Prophet says that it reveals that there's not time oh my goodness the mysteries of the seventh seal is time is no more Hallelujah watch this you say well could you please give me this Bible that you read our Prophet said if you ever have trouble doing your devotions get the Holy Ghost he said after the bite the seals were open he said this Bible became a brand new brand new book I was studying the deeper I got into it I spent days this week I never left the living room and the deeper I got into it I was like Spellbound I was like out of control eternity just a taste of Eternity he said you say well could you please show me an example in the scriptures thank you for asking in the Bible after Pentecost Peter get up or sorry after the upper room and a bunch of people come out and they were and the people in down said those people have been in that church in Wyoming again and they got some new wine in there I think I'll break into the fellowship all through the windows that aren't fasting yet and get me some of that I'm helping you understand I'm bringing it up to today and Peter said and Peter said this is that what's that the time should be no more and this is that the prophet George spoke of baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah when God himself put his foot on the land and the sea he took every spirit watch this the Earth is Satan's domain the prophet said that the devil is controlled of the world I don't care who you vote in and I might have an opinion that's all it's worth is an opinion but it won't matter who the states gets for a new leader and it won't even matter if we get a different one here which would be really nice it won't make no difference because the exact same person is controlling this race would you like to know who that person is Satan it'll be a different face but it'll be exactly the same spirit but when God himself came down and he said that the land he puts Satan under his feet wow and he said the sea hate that one I'm the boss oh my God amazing here in Joel 2 25 let's pull that up I will restore the years that the Locust has eaten what the canker worm has eaten what the caterpillar has eaten oh my and the Palmer worm and my great Army which I sat among you who will God who will restore it Jehovah God the same Jehovah God that came down and put his foot on the land and the Sea do you see it you're not a perchance you weren't no accident it wasn't your your mom and dad's planning oh it goes away beyond that oh my Mom and Dad decided that we were good oh garbage this Jehovah God this is Elohim he's omnipotent this was planned oh my Daniel 10 11. to 14 and he saw a great vision on the first day he prayed and he came and I and came back to Persia and was oh here here's sorry and Daniel I'm sorry I misread this I'm sorry hearing Daniel Daniel had a problem and he prayed to God and and I'm just showing you how God operates and and God said he said no can I paraphrase or not amen and so Daniel praise and God says man there's a lot of people praying right now so I'll send you okay bro foreign Gabriel came and your prayer didn't get answered for 21 days Daniel said well I guess God must have fell asleep oh maybe he maybe he don't answer me no more you've had those thoughts maybe God don't care oh come on Church and here Michael Kane and he wrestled with Satan for 21 days and even the angels had cell phones and they called for backup and they didn't call another angel they called for the king of kings the Lord of lords Jehovah Jireh my provider the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the Bright Morning Star Elohim wow then he came on the scene and immediately immediately you got that immediately Michael went to Daniel and he said thank you thank you I was on my way but there's a traffic jam and it was caused by Luke Satan so I called for God and he dealt with the traffic jam and now I've come to you remember the space of time wow was God there all the time was God there that moment 21 days you say I'm not in eternity blessed God I'm still up to work for a living 21 years 21 days just since 64. that's all that's not even been it's been like a day to God amen you pray and you say God when are you coming back to get me into Rapture and God's up in heaven says I've already come back and got you in a rapture he said but God I ain't seeing no changes he said well read my word I'll reveal myself unto you oh my church unbelievable but it's true God has been dealing with his bride you brothers and sisters sitting right here for years in Unwritten words but he's trying to get you to sit down shut up long enough that you could tune in and here there's still small voice wow oh thank you Lord thank you Lord I believe that's what I did this week I never had nothing to do I just was home and I was alone and God Came Calling oh thank you Lord God tell you what wow it felt like a honeymoon me and God unbelievable see you this morning brothers and sisters you are completely set free past tense in Jesus name oh man hallelujah oh man the angels are gathered around not just this meaning but around your life what did Satan code do in Jesus you know Jesus called them the the people to heaven the elders and he was talking you know having a meeting now you can imagine that church was a holy church oh I'm trying to show you God is real I mean he's really real brother Matt here God calls God's God's preaching it's going to be good and they're gathered in heaven on streets of gold and they got solid brass pews and all the elders I haven't show up and Lucifer comes to him you mean he had a split Church yep it's God if God had oh wow when Jesus was on Earth he had 12 disciples and one was the devil and he knew it the whole time they said what are you doing Satan remember I said that the angels are encamped about us right here you don't really believe that because sometimes you have fear well I just tell you what these angels are qualified in all kinds of warfare amen Hallelujah amen and God I say and he said what are you doing he said well I was trying to find somebody to dump and so I was walking around in Wyoming in the area and God reaching Sarnia and he said well did you ever consider job oh my God I considered him God why sure I did but God let's play fair you're cheating God said how do you mean Satan I take that as an offense you see it he ain't gonna let somebody touch his bride you're oh are you kidding he said what do you mean and he said well you are in camped about him and built the Hedge around about them with angels and that was before the Holy Ghost was given that was in the Old Testament with shadows and type of the real sacrifice how much more Lord we should be walking on air Psalms 34 7 maybe we better pull that up oh my I tell you what after this week I knew this morning was going to be good I can't make this stuff up I'm just not that smart brother Matt I'm the angel of the Lord is in Camp around them that are arrogant cocky educated and know everything well that was the new ID version foreign that are farmers that fear Him the uneducated fishermen Beyond learned he hid it from the wise sure glad and let's just look at this scripture just how it's wrote I I believe the word of God would be good to compare I I was not very good at English but I never ever failed an English class in high school but I came really close but that looks to me like it's past tense and he was thinking about delivering no he delivereth for them it's already happened so you didn't think you didn't think you were questioning whether I was thinking he's already delivered to you brother Matt to God since revelation 10. since he came down himself and revealed the seals which was every Speck of his secrets right through the messenger the prophet God's like Matt I give them ever what oh oh you people that are looking for something else you can stop looking our Prophet said that he's given you everything he could give you bless God I'm looking for something to come in the next 30 days well brother Dale's not if I get any more I'm gonna blow up not really but amen don't insult God he's already all and delivered past tense hello hello I hope they get the saved I hope I hope it works out for me what version are you reading oh my Hallelujah man wow I started to tell you my notes just reminded me I started to tell you Joshua went around Jericho seven days that was Grace did I finish that no one in the ark God shut the door seven days you know what if those people would have knocked on the door before it rained God would open the door and save them he said I don't think so brother Dale ah I'm sure glad you asked that's exactly what God did and seven churches just brother Matt he went around Jericho seven times and he said if they would want to repent which they couldn't because they weren't gods they weren't part of his program I'll give them seven days to repent when they got to know in the ark and he put eight souls in the ark which is a type of Eternity he said I'll wait seven days he had already waited 120 years hello he said I'll even shut the door and I'll say now this is for Real he's showing the world does anybody catch us he's showing the world I really need business here I put the people I said in the boat and I shut the door and that's exactly what God did in seven Church ages and they killed the prophets Stone the prophets and killed the Lord Jesus and that same spirit is still alive trying to kill man of God in the ministry of the bride of Christ you know if we're part of Christ it don't matter who has ten thousand in his church 410. don't matter who has the new church or an old one don't matter who is smart who's number anybody that was smart in the Bible God had to take it out of them before he could use them see it don't matter it don't matter who's driving a new car and who's driving the new car you sitting me it don't matter who Waters who plants but God gives the increase but a lot of people don't know that because I've heard ministers and the exact furthest ways country that I've ever I'll say the Philippines it was the Philippines and the minister was complaining to me because Felix got saved in our church but he got baptized in brother Matt's he said brother Matt you knew better than to baptize him because he got saved in my direction God's up there that is cool oh yeah that's exactly what he's saying oh wow he's saying wow I thought I thought I'd give him everything ahead I thought I'd give them everything I had you're kidding right wow that's unbelievable but that's also true we're not a part of that anything that does anything for the betterment of God is on our side period period amen what did Jesus tell the disciples make sure you're not fighting against somebody on our side here in Psalms 46 let's I'm just going to paraphrase this 46 6-11 you can read this you can write it down you can take pictures of my notes they're actually legible today because I printed them off amen if I write them I normally have to interpret them myself after but here it says all the kingdoms of the Earth will fall this is John Psalms 46 6-11 I'm just paraphrasing well maybe we'll read it the heathen reared the rage the kingdoms were moved and he uttered his voice and the Earth amen fire the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Sheila come Behold The Works of the Lord what desolations he hath made in the Earth and he hath made maketh Wards to cease upon the ends of the Earth and he breakth the bow and cutteth the spear and Splendor and he burneth the church be still and no I'm the boss don't get too don't get say I you know I was blessed God I had a good family and I was be careful God might take it from you be still and know that I'm God and I will be exalted among the heathens that's pretty good and I will be exalted in the Earth one more verse the Lord of hosts is with us tomorrow well not yet because I'm still struggling today if you're still struggling this morning I'm going to cut rate to the Chase and sometimes brother Dale still struggles there's too much abuse and because there ain't no struggle God don't struggle with God the Holy Ghost don't struggle with God and all the god that's here don't struggle with the god that's amen and so I don't struggle with brother Matt or brother Bernard or brother Tim or Jared the boys because because God don't struggle with God so if there's a struggle there's a lot too much blood flesh and blood oh Hallelujah the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our protector our refuge wow wow I'm I'm part four of I think it'll be a lot more amen let me just read you a couple quotes and maybe we'll close with that man if I don't Mark where I stopped I'll repreach everything twice amen don't resent this that's the truth the Rapture is in US in US now I'll prove it by the gospel I love a prophet like that I just love a prophet like that I love anybody like that says I'll prove it I like proof those who he called he justified and those that he justified you he's already glorified and how he says hallelujah then in heaven today in the presence of God right now you are not only there but glorified oh buddy I I can't like what amazing I'm going to read another here in questions and answers in 64. he said now notice the Bible said when Daniel saw Daniel wrote the Book of Revelations but it was Daniel he wrote the first Book of Revelations the same God came again and wrote Revelations again and said exactly the same thing just to prove to you that he was still God and how many would remember reading you'll notice in John in Revelations he came to the same thing Revelations 1 and he stood there and this well watch well I got to start the beginning story forgive me and we'll notice in the vision that Daniel saw that he came to the the the tying and he seen that the person come down and his hair was white as wool Daniel and how many would remember reading that when you'll notice in John in Revelations it came the same thing in Revelations 1 and he stood there and his hair was as white as wool now Daniel didn't call John on his cell phone and transfer his notes by email but there was email before it was called Jehovah God the Holy Ghost Elohim all-knowing oh and he stood there and his hair was white as wool and he put his feet this way and the ancients time oh man and the Ancients of time and that is it had no time the Eternal one he came now watch he says the Saints came to Earth and the books were opened and another book was opened in The Book of Life from the one and they came to the judgment and he came with them ten thousands times ten thousands he's right and is that right he said minister to him the bride the queen to the king now you remember back and I'm going to close with this remember back what I said what our worship should be like I'm not talking about garbage I'm talking about fellowship with your love life Jehovah God spiritually your your maker your your king your lord your savior your everything okay he said ministers the bride ministers the queen to the king now watch that's what I'm going to close with us who is your little Queen in the home now any of you that are married you think of your wife she ministers to you she ministers the food to you is that right now you're late on this now but when she then ministers to you that's what the bride does to Christ the word it's worship man shall not live by bread alone but by every word amen see and she minute I'm I'm reading word for word and she ministers the word to the king Jehovah God manifesting the promised word in the age that she's living in my question to you is are you manifesting eternity time is no more the age that you're living in it's not the age of time to Christ right now in your day are you ministering all the Mysteries I revealed and time is a blur wow amen oh I said something then and you didn't get it but notice oh my that was a good one see ministering in the age the word now notice she came and he came Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand came to him and judgment was set and the books were open another book was the the lamb the The Book of Life and they judged us and who was it that come the bride did not have to come to be judged she was already judged she actually he says it like this I'm sorry he says she was free of judgment other places he said she's already amen let's stand part two amen Hallelujah wow amen thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus God loves you and this is no mistake what he's doing it's no mistake what he's doing actually let me put it like this it's no mistake what he's already done already done and time Revelations 10 6. and time shall be no more now that time I it's from the time that Christ Jesus came down in a cloud our Prophet said that happened in our very own age I didn't read you next week I'll read you the next week I'll read you where that happened and the Believers of that day when the scientists couldn't figure out what it was they said brother Brown you know what it was why don't you take it to them and show them in the scriptures and what it was I'll read that next Sunday or next time I preach John Garrett's preaching next Sunday by the way but they wanted the Believers wanted brother Brown to go to science and show them what the cloud was and when brother Branham was driving I believed to do it God says it's not for them go to the Tabernacle see on that quote alone don't mislead me this truth of a prophet and the Mystery is being revealed you couldn't preach it no realer than this morning but that's where believers are wrong when they go out and they put brother Branham in the front because it wasn't for them it wasn't for most of them and this is what I mean by that if it's for somebody and they come to a denominational understanding of Christ will never leave them there he promised that he promised that now what do you say come out of her my people he promised them if they won't come out of her then then you've shown them it's going to do uh-huh so get unto Christ and Christ through the unwritten word you say that can't happen did it happen to Rebecca did Rebecca know what Eliezer had told God that's up to you to decide amen Eliezer said if she's what watch how he said that amen if she's predestinated bride material I won't even have to show her the books I'm not talking against the books I'm not talking about the message do you see what I'm saying and she was and got picture and it wasn't even spoken wow oh that's good now that don't take away from the bugs I'll read you the quote you know when we picked this up how God told Brother Branham don't take it to the scientists it's not for them amen thanks for coming and letting me preach I hadn't Sunday wouldn't it came soon I would I would have needed a safety valve just a he is you see God he's everywhere he's like the story of the little boy that said he asked his mom and she said I don't know it was God I don't see God that's the preacher I don't see God this I just see churches and I said Sunday's going to teach her so oh nobody's seen God bless God and he went and asked one of the disciple old fishermen that the modern day world would call handicap could only canoe a canoe these are Isis of God and everything I see God in my boat and my oars and my fish in the lake and trees and the you know if you read this Bible enough because of a prophets you'll see that God's everywhere it was just like God showed himself and then he showed himself again that's why when the people get to the judgment they will never have even us a hair of an excuse you're never going to get there and say oh bless God I didn't know I couldn't do that oh no it'll be or it'll be come on in oh my God thank you Lord the word will be in the bride and she'll not only know what he wants done with it but she'll have thus saying the Lord that's in spoken word The Original Seed Hallelujah oh my goodness if God allows me to I might try to preach a couple of these messages on your God help us amen to remember our trip is coming together very beautifully and we thank you all of you even the ones online just showed support in every way and God bless your hearts we'll uh your reward will be huge you know your reward will be huge Every Soul that brother Leo baptizes and you had a part of it or some peace that star will come back unto your crown everyone our Prophet said that said the lady that cleaned up the barn and had the Revival and Dwight Moody I believe it was came was the only person only person that came the only person that went to the Altar and got saved and saved millions of souls for Jesus Christ said every one of those Souls will be on that sister's crowd because she obeyed and believed oh it's this is so

Hallelujah Hallelujah I want to finish my little comparison that God brought back to me when I was praying then we're gonna sing that song do you know how it feels I believe God wants you to know how he feels about you I believe that president I mentioned about fire and about the prophet said there was a fire that kept the lions from Daniel but that same fire never burned Daniel and I showed you how there was fire that came to Moses in the burning bush but it never burnt the burning bush you have that same fire today if you have the Holy Ghost you do but there was another example and God's perfected in three perfection it was when the three Hebrew children were put in the fire departments the fire that was in there and you were questioning he sewed himself and he showed himself and he showed himself he showed himself but the ones down the road don't know that because they rejected the word is that amazing fire that wasn't hot the Holy Ghost beautifully now let's sing that course just the course and we'll be dismissed on the course do you know how it feels do we have words for an opinion I believe with all my heart I might have the kids sing this when I preach again God wants you to know how he feels about you amen we'll just sing the course I'm running my time [Music] he owns everything and how does it feels [Music] predestinations Christ you know how it feels [Music] everything by the one who created the Stars [Music] with you man I can't shut her down Pastor Leo told me early I have Pentecostal people come to me and say if you got the right God and you got the true God and you know all the Mysteries and what he does is hot bamboo and the weevil's eating the wood but now they're coming to him and they're saying I recognize your heavenly father he owns everything [Music] how did you God put up the biggest building in town remember that space of time he just wanted to prove just remember those 21 days that Satan withheld Micah the angel but when Jehovah [Music] oh Hallelujah I gotta sing this and stop then how did you know you're excited father [Music] owns everything and how does it feel to know your love by the one who created Stars up above thank you Lord [Music]
