that promise God bless you this morning name is Zachary Wallace I'm from Ohio now but formerly from Arizona and uh run into a few of you through the years but uh I plan on spending quite a few more years with you later but this morning uh brother Nathan Erikson was supposed to be here and then he was going to miss his grandfather's U 86th birthday I think so you know you you got to take advantage of those those when you get older like that and so uh I'm your spare tire preacher today but uh we know the Lord Jesus is the same and so we're just trusting in Him this morning to to uh speak to us so if we could just open up in our Bibles to familiar portion of scripture here Malachi the 4th chapter and we will uh read a portion there and then also in Genesis Malachi chter 4 verse one for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all that proud and yay all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now also at Genesis 19 and just to repeat that first line there it said for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven so you know I it can be a little cold up here but friends it's going to get warm the day is coming when things are going to burn as an oven and Genesis 1927 we read here of Abraham and it says and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and behold and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace you can be seated this morning I I want to take a thought this morning on the Keystone of the Bible the the Keystone of the Bible and now a keystone uh how many here know what a keystone is in construction um so a keystone is say you're building an archway or a bridge and you'll start at two points and you'll you'll lay a brick here and then you'll build another one just just a little bit of an angle and you'll build it up to a certain point and you'll bring the other side up to a certain point but until the Keystone is in place if you put any weight on it it's not stable the whole thing will collapse but you get this Keystone it's a it's a it's an a bit of a pyramid wedge shaped stone and you put that right in the Capstone which is also the Keystone and it sets right in there and once the Keystone is in place it ties the two sides together and then once those two sides are tied together you can actually put a burden and a on there because it's stabilized it can carry the load and it's it's it's it's actually structurally uh stable now but without that Keystone there it's not tied together and things will start to fall apart and so I want to look at the the Keystone of the Bible today and and there's been a few different keystones we can look at one Keystone was John the Baptist he was the connection between the between law and Grace he was the one that kind of stood in that Gap and brother he mentions here he was the he was that Keystone he says what did you see in that Prophet I say unto you he was more than a prophet he was the bright and Shining Light he was the word made light he was the word manifested John came as a manifestation of the word to tie the two together between law and Grace and and it was that that connection and we see that Jesus Christ himself he was the Keystone of of the the the Old Testament and the New Testament tying it together in himself and he says here in the Rapture message uh says Jesus being that Keystone he bear record see he was the Keystone between the old and the New Testament because he had first to die and then Rapture he died come to life and walked around here with us and then he was raptured up because he was the Keystone that tied the two together and so when when you see a keystone it connects things it holds them together so that there's not a a separation and the Keystone of this Bible is what makes it all run together it ties it all together it makes it all work so that it doesn't just fall apart when you try to put a little weight on it you're like wait what's going on I don't understand if you can find the Keystone it'll make it all run in continuity it'll make it all work together now in the church ages brother BR says the Lord gave me a very script a key the Lord where gave me a scriptural key to in to understand who each messenger was for the ages and he says in fact it might be called the Keystone of the Bible it is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is the Keystone that ties the entire Bible together when you can look at it and you can recognize that Jesus back there is the same Jesus today the Jesus that was there at the beginning of the foundation of the world that was there at the the crucifixion that's here right now it's the same one you begin to see that continuity of the Scriptures it begins to tie it all together and when you can catch that Revelation you've found that Keystone of the entire Bible and Ecclesiastes 3:14 it says I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him for that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God requireth that which is passed so we see that Keystone is that God is unchanging in his ways he is the unchanging God what he did at the beginning we see in the first church now what what was the first church what what what's the record we have about the first church what do we call that what what would what do you call that in the Bible I I teach Sunday school so I ask lots of questions so we have a record in this Bible and it's the record of the first church you know what it's called no try again it's New Testament it's the record of the first church all right go ahead brother Jared hey acts you got it it's the book of Acts that's what the church is supposed to look like that is the pattern because what God did the first time is what he wants to do the next time he didn't start out with a book of Acts church that had the power of God the baptism of the Holy Spirit the speaking of tongues the Miracles the supernatural he had all these things and he says yeah I did that once that was really mistake we're not doing that again my God doesn't make a mistake when he establishes a church it's an acts 238 Church it has the power of God in it that's the church that he establishes and he's the one that's in it living through it expressing himself doing the acts of the holy spirit in the people that's what the church looks like and that's what it's going to look like every time that it's his church now if it's just a religion it won't have it if it's just man-made Creeds and dogmas it's not going to be there but when God has a called out people when God has a church that's what it's going to look like because God doesn't change he chose himself a messenger for that first age it was the Apostle Paul he believed in the Supernatural the power of God he believed in Miracles the raising of the dead he preached the word without compromise and if somebody was saying something contrary to what that Prophet messenger said he says I don't care if it's an angel from heaven now I mean if an angel comes from heaven and tells you something you check it with a word you don't say well he's from Heaven he's an angel yeah well Lucifer was an angel in heaven one time too but if you don't get if you get away from that word you are lost and so that Paul he stood there and he says I don't care if an angel from heaven comes what I'm telling you is the Commandments of the Lord that's right now what God did with that first messenger is the pattern of what he wants to do with the messenger and that's the scriptural key whereby brother Randon was able to identify God's Messengers through those ages how they stayed with that word and how they believed in the the the moving of God and how the the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire was moving in their midst now if you look in in Malachi chapter 3 and 6 he says behold it it says uh for I am the Lord Malachi 3:6 and I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed that's so beautiful to me because if if it were to be based off of the works or the ability or the goodness of the people of Jacob they'd be destroyed right but God says I've chosen a people and because of that choosing he he chose them he placed his elective Grace upon Israel he says they are mine if it was not for that Grace if it was not for that they would be destroyed but he says I chose them I'm not going going to change my mind I am God and I change not and it's because of that you are going to be my people why is there a PE a a nation of Israel on this Earth after 2,000 years because God doesn't change he chose them he claimed them he said they're mine and there's nothing they could do to change that they failed him if if there was if it was based off of Works they failed him too many times if it was based off of they they they crucified the very Son of God if it's based off of Works they're gone but it's not based off of works it's based off of the elective love and grace of almighty God he says they are mine and in this day God has said that he will have a bride if it was based off of your Merit your ability your good works you would fail but it's based off of the elective grace of God has declared I will have a bride I will have a people and she's going to be there because he is God and he changes not God chose Israel now they did many things that he didn't approve of and and he allowed many things to happen to them that really he didn't like to to see his people go through all of these things but he permits things and and there's a little bit of a difference when you understand that God will permit things that he doesn't really like he doesn't really like it to be that way uh uh some simple examples here uh he the prophet came to him and he says thus sayith the Lord you're sick unto death prepare your house you're going to die Hezekiah he gets down on his knees and he begins to pray and before the prophet could get out of the palace the Lord spoke back to him and says go back to him tell him I heard his prayer now if God Hears A Prayer then he doesn't change he'll hear a prayer now and he says I heard his prayer go back and tell him that he's got 15 more years and that he can set his house in order and these things things tell him that I've given him a sign and the sun dial is going to turn backwards and put a bunch of figs on it and this cancer or boiler or whatever it is is going to go away and the man was healed he raised up now we we we see that but did you know that it would actually have been better for him if he'd had died right then because later he invited Babylon to come in and see all of his wealth and his children suffered the price because of that and everything he had was taken into Babylon later it would have been better for him if he would have died when that when the word of the Lord came to him and says get ready it's time to go home it would have been better but he prayed and he actually changed that program of God now I want you to think about that he prayed something cont the he had got the word of the lord it's your time to go he' prayed and he' actually changed the plan of God God permitted him to live longer but it would have been better if he would have just accepted what the word of the Lord came to him but I want you to notice the power of prayer if God will answer a prayer even when it's contrary to his perfect will how much more will he answer a prayer when you say Lord I'm believing for me and my household to be saved I'm standing on your promise I'm standing on your word and you're asking according to the word how much more will the god that changes not keep that promise to you that's right look at look at uh Jesus when he came and he said they asked him about marriage and divorce hor and and they says well what about these things and he says well the Lord for the god of Israel for because of the hardness of your heart he permitted it he permitted a writing of divorcement he says but from the beginning it wasn't so and we see in Malachi 2:16 for the Lord the god of Israel saith that he hateth putting away God hates divorce he hates it and yet because of the hardness of their hearts he permitted a writing divorcement but from the beginning it was not so and so we see what some people would look at like almost a change in his opinion or a change in his Pros he says he hates divorce but then he allows it over here like what's going on but he does not change his away he does not change his thoughts he has a plan he has a perfect he has a perfect will but we can get out of that into a permissive will we can get away from the God's perfect plan but no matter what happens it will come around to fulfill the perfect plan and purpose of God the purpose of God has never been defeated now you can take yourself down some bumpy roads but God's going to get you where he said he was going to get you yes sir now what is it that does not change God's nature does not change who he is his characteristics his identity who he really is on the inside that does not change now we we would say well what is that you know what is that nature what is that characteristics well to really get into the nature of God we'd need about a 150 million year series to get into this because the nature of God is just as Eternal as he is and it it would go beyond uh comprehension and and you know we're going to spend all of eternity delving into and understanding the great love of God for God is love what it was to be a redeemer a savior A Healer a father those are his characteristics that's his nature he's always been a redeemer he's always had the nature of a savior of a Healer it's always been there and it's been expressed and it doesn't changed he wasn't a Healer back 2,000 years ago he wasn't a Healer when there was a brass Serpent and now today he's not a Healer anymore if he was a Healer with a brass serpent if he was a Healer when he passed barus he still a Healer here this morning because he is gone and he changes not he's the god of love he's the god of Mercy he's the God of Justice and therefore he's a god of judgment he never breaks his word he hides himself in Simplicity that's his characteristic that's his nature when God does something it's going to be in Simplicity that's his nature and you begin to recognize his nature recognize his characteristics and then you can identify him when he comes in an unexpected way God doesn't change God stays the same but he comes in a way that surprises people they say a baby in a Manger what are you talking about it was God in Simplicity coming exactly according to prophecy and they missed it because they didn't recognize his nature but God doesn't change God is a god of of redemption of Love of Mercy he's a god of forgiveness I was reading the other day in Samuel and it says how Nathan came up to David and told him this story about this man who had committed a great sin and and David got so angry he says that that's that's wrong he says that that person they should that person should die and you know it's a lot easier to see the sin in the person sitting next to you or and your and your spouse and all the faults that they have and you can see it and everybody else but then Nathan just picked that mirror up and showed David David you're the man and there's going to be a judgment on your house he says your children are going to suffer because of this there's going to be War rise up he give he tells him this this curse that's going to come upon his home of judgment because of this and the moment he ceases to speak David says I have sinned against the Lord he didn't make any arguments any excuses any he just immediately the first thing out of David's mouth was I have sinned I was wrong I shouldn't have done that and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die it didn't take six weeks of sackcloth and Ashes for God to forgive David it took one thing a repentant heart the moment David said I have sinned I was wrong and he confessed his sin that instant not 6 weeks later not two years later that instant God says I have forgiven your sin if he would forgive David under the blood of the BS and goats if he would forgive David under that the moment he says I've been wrong I've sinned forgive me Lord that moment he was forgiven he'll do the same thing for me today when I fail and when I fall down the moment that I'll confess and say Lord God I'm wrong I've sinned forgive me that instant my sin has passed away because he's God and he changes is not that word he said to put away thy sin says God hath put away thy sin that word is a bar which means to pass away to immigrate leave one's territory to vanish to perish cease to exist when David confessed his sin when we take what we've done wrong and we bring it before the Lord and he drops it into that ink that washes it away it ceases to exist in the sight of almighty God David didn't have to do no Penance he didn't have to go do any Works to manufacture a forgiveness he just had to confess his sin that's right I feel like we we look we see how God does something the first time and we know how he's going to do it again I want to ask you when you gave your life to Jesus Christ and when you were forgiven of your sins what works did you do to get him to forgive you what merits did you put there and say I deserve this forgiveness nothing if you tried to produce anything he rejected it all you did was come down and you knelt down at his feet and you said God I'm a sinner I'm a failure but I'm coming beneath the blood of a shed lamb that was said you would forgive my sins that's I'm accepting that and you got away from there walked up and you stood away and you were forgiven and you were free from your sin and I want to ask you now when you failed now and when you've made that mistake now how are you going to get rid of that sin are you going to go be really good you going to attend church for a long time and get some good merits same way you did it the first time and he forgave you that's the same way he'll do it this time you come down to him you kneel down at his feet and you say God I messed up I failed I was wrong forgive me Lord don't try to put any of your own abilities and merits into the question cuz that's not how he did it the first time it's by Grace you are saved there was that woman that came to Jesus and you know we don't know her name but we know she was a great sinner everybody knew she was a sinner she knew she was a sinner the Pharisees knew she was a sinner Jesus knew she was a sinner she came in and she began to wash his feet with her tears and those Pharisees were sitting around with all of their self-righteousness which was filthy rags and they were criticizing her and they should have been doing what she was doing right how many times do people criticize the person who's actually doing the very thing that they ought have been doing but she kneeled down there and she began to wash his feet with her tears and she began to repent at his feet and she began to do a service for him because she seen that it needed to be done somebody needed to wash away the dirt and the criticism and the mockery off of Jesus feet and you know what she did she washed his feet with her tears and she wiped off his feet with her hair and she actually bore his reproach when she walked out of there where did all that dirt and that mud off of the road go it was on her it was on her face it was on her hair she bore his reproach and he bore her sin and they were criticizing and mocking her and they were saying oh if that man was really a prophet he'd know what kind of a woman was at his feet oh he knew and he knew who they were and he knew they were worse off condition than she was and he turned to her and he says wherefore I say unto thee her sins which were many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they said and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also they didn't say it out loud he knew the heart and he said unto the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace if he forgave her and she was a great sinner there's no questions asked she was a great sinner but the unchanging God forgave her and he'd do it again he doesn't change his ways he's the same God Psalms 103 says bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases if you can really catch an understanding of the power of the blood of Jesus Christ that has forgiven our sins forgiven our iniquities then you could lay aside that unbelief that says oh but I'm not good enough oh I'm not you're not good enough you're absolutely right but it's never been about you it's about your sacrifice and the worthiness of that perfect lamb if it was worthy then you are worthy if it was not worthy then you are not worthy you say well I'm not good enough to get healed when you say that you're actually confessing that Jesus Christ was not a sufficient sacrifice but I say that he was the perfect Lamb of God and it was a sufficient sacrifice and therefore you can take possession of every divine blessing of God because he was found worthy and I am found in him Jesus Christ is the one who could stand there and look at that woman that was caught in adultery and he says whoever is without sin you cast the first stone and I say before you throw a stone at your neighbor make sure that you've never committed a sin yourself that's right if you're sinless then you've got the right to condemn somebody if you're not you're nothing but a hypocrite Jesus said whoever is without sin cast a stone at her and they all just turned around and walked away and Jesus said unto her where are thine accusers hath no man condemned thee and she said no man Lord you know there was one person there that could throw a stone there was one person there that had never sinned he could have picked up a throne Stone and thrown it at her but he said neither do I condemn me if he didn't condemn her he's not here to condemn me now and he said go and sin no more I'm so thankful to know that there's a God of mercy and a god of forgiveness no matter how much of a failure you are no matter how much you failed no matter how much you sinned there is a God of mercy and Grace on the throne who still forgives a repentant sinner he could condemn us but he didn't he could have cast us away but he didn't he brought forgiveness he brought mercy and I'm so thankful today to know that that he is an unchanging God and no matter how much you might fail him one day he the god of Mercy that's there to forgive now there will come a day when mercy will be finished there will come a day when salvation will be completed and in that day there will be no mercy or forgiveness to be found but I'm so happy to know that there's still blood there's still Mercy in Lamentations it says it is of the Lord's Mercy that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness oh friends we serve a God who is great in his Mercy who's great in his love and his compassion for us now there will be a day when he's a God of Justice and he has to bring judgment but if you have been found under the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ Justice will declare you perfect but if you're trying to get in on your own merits you can just give up now God does not change if he forgave a sinner once that repented if another sinner comes in Repentance he'll forgive them as well he's God he changes not if he for if he rejected those who came with their man-made religion Pharisee self-righteousness he'll do the same thing again God does not change you look at job job stood in the Gap and he believed in a blood sacrifice for his family and for his children and his children were saved because he believed in the shed blood of that sacrifice which was all that he had brother Brandon said in the sermon thy house and you know if there's anybody here that that has unsaved loved ones go to tiffon Georgia thy house 1961 it'll just give you such a joy to know that you have a promise but in here he he says he says uh because he was standing job because he was standing on everything that God gave us to be righteous or gave him was to offer that burnt offering job had done what God required offer a sacrifice and he know that was God's word and it could not fail so did you ever think where them children was they was in heaven waiting for him he's with them today and God saved job's children they were in heaven waiting for him why because he offered a sacrifice and he says God I've done what you commanded everything's gone wrong but I he went out and he sat on that Ashy and he says but I offered a burnt sacrifice this is what God required and he stood on that he stood on that promise and he would not let go of it because he knew it was God's word and I I remember a time when I thought oh I wish I could just go and offer a sacrifice and that my children I would know everything was right and my family and my wife oh that'd be so nice and then I heard the prophet say he says it's easier than that now because we don't have to offer a sacrifice we only have to accept and believe the sacrifice that's already been made Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you and your household shall be saved God doesn't change if he saved job's children if he saved Rahab and her family that was under that shed blood of that token that she had in her home if he saved the centurion's family that he told believe and you and our household shall be saved then I declare today he's the same God he doesn't change and if you'll be this like job and hold on to that sacrifice your children will be there for he said in Isaiah that they will gather together in that great land and they'll build houses and they'll inhabit them and not another they'll eat plant Vineyards and they'll Harvest them and not another and they shall be there with their offspring that means that my children are going to be there in that land with me because that scripture is my scripture that's my prophecy I'm going to be the one in that Millennial Reign I'm going to be there in that land planting and harvesting and building I'm going to be that one there and it said that my offspring would be with me and God's word cannot fail God doesn't change he doesn't change his mind he never made a mistake he's never failed what he said one time he stands behind minded for all of eternity thank you Jesus God doesn't change that's the Keystone of the Bible healing is available healing is yours to receive God doesn't change when they came out of Israel when uh Egypt they came out under Exodus under a prophetic Ministry that was bringing them to a land of promise the promised word for that hour when they came out under that Exodus they were given Divine Healing there was not one feeble person among their tribes now do you know why there was not one feeble person there just before they left Egypt they had some dinner and what was that dinner they had before they left Egypt what do you remember what do you remember brother what was their dinner they had before they left Egypt it's my Sunday school lesson got to make sure you guys are awake they had a lamb and they had unleavened bread that lamb was a type of the lamb and when they ate the type of the Lamb not one person was feeble when they walked out of Egypt and if the type of the Lamb would bring forth a healing like that what would the literal Lord Jesus Christ that has come to us in this day what would it do to you you don't have to have one feeble person among you you can go forth in strength and in power into this land of promise because we're not eating a type we're eating the reality there's healing in the communion cup there's healing in that partaking because it's a representation of the real I am the Lord Jehovah that Health thee that was the whole medical prescription for the children of Israel in Egypt coming out of Egypt for 40 years they walk through the Wilderness and they says well you know listen Moses things are really getting bad we had this come up we had that come up do you think maybe we could go over and and and and start a little psychology course no no he says hold on let me check what the the remedy is yeah hadn't changed I'm the Lord that Health the no matter what came up no matter what the situation no matter what the problem he had one answer and I have one answer for you today the answer is that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Healer there's not some other answer there's not some other solution it's Jesus Christ the Healer now God can he can bless you with some medicine and things you know personally I'm I'm a little skeptic because it's like they're practicing they haven't figured it out yet but you know God can use some things he can bless some things but let me tell you this Jesus Christ is the answer medication is not the answer psychology is not the answer another great doctor is not the answer the answer is Jesus Christ because he is the Healer there was not one feeble person among them and did you know that that healing power was so great that their clothes didn't even wear out their shoes didn't get holes I read something the other day that just struck me and nemiah had never noticed it before Nehemiah 9:21 it says their clothed wax not old and their feet swelled not walking around in the wilderness for 40 years and they never even had swollen feet you see if God was going to fix the shoes and make sure they didn't wear out why not just fix the feet while he was at it you I kind of Wonder Maybe the kids' clothes grew on them while they were growing I mean I don't know but I mean think about who was there Jehovah God anything's possible and who's here today anything is possible you say oh well you know I I was listening to that sermon thy house he says oh well you need a job believe on the Lord he says you need new furniture believe on the Lord and that just struck me I'm like wait a minute you can ask God for furniture don't limit him if there's something you desire in your heart talk to him about it he might just be waiting for you to say something that's Jehovah god of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new he only changed his mask from Spirit to man changed his expression his form God does not change his nature but his form is constantly changing and you know uh back last week uh I was at my house and we had a little problem with the plumbing and so I had to get in there I I do construction so I never call anybody to help me with anything I just do it myself and so I took the plumbing apart and I'm working on it trying to get that that sewage problem fixed and and uh it's it's actually a Wednesday night I'm supposed to preach that night and and the house is backing up and I'm like what am I going to do and so I'm trying to get that fixed and somebody upstairs they flushed the toilet oh man you know you know you think you think you're not you know not an emotional person or something well you get an experience like that you might find a little more shou and emotion than you knew you had you know when you have an exp something happens to you and I got you know I let out a few hollers and whoops down there and I was not real excited about that you know I was very messy same guy in this suit the same guy that had a nice warm shower this morning it's the same guy that was that mess over there now don't really look the same but it's the same person a few days ago I was out hunting in the woods and we got we got a whole bunch of deer and and uh we were you know cleaning them out and and it was cold out and you know you had blood all over you and just just everything was a mess and and you know the same person here in this suit was literally covered in debris and Gunk and blood and and guts and everything just a couple days ago same person that's right but you know if I have walked in this door in that form you might not have been so sure about this but you see I came in a form you expected I came dressed in a suit and tie but if I had have come here showed up with with you know deer deer blood all over me it had been the same person preaching the same word but you might not have received it because of the way it came that's right Jesus don't miss don't look at the clothes don't look at the form don't look at how he approached look for him look for his nature look for who he is and when you recognize him then forget about the clothes and how he looks oh he looks like it's a mess and it looks like this it's Jesus Christ that's the one you found God doesn't change his nature but his form is constantly changing he came down Through the Ages he came to Moses in a pillar of fire did you know Moses he met in a pillar of fire he gave him a commission he had this P incredible experience Joshua came and he met that same person but it wasn't a pillar of Fire all right who wants to volunteer this answer it wasn't the pillar of fire that that Joshua met who was it go ahead you look like you're eager to answer he met a man go ahead brother in the back yeah there a man standing there with with a sword drawn and that man it was a man and he said to him take off your shoes you're standing on Holy Ground and you keep reading and it says and the Lord told Joshua this is how you're going to win the battle you see it was the same man that was in that Pillar of Fire the same person the same nature was that Pillar of Fire it moved out of a pillar of fire into a man standing there with a sword and Joshua had the same experience that Moses had he met the same person but it was a slightly different form oh don't miss who's in your presence because he comes in an unexpected way Joshua stood there and he recognized who he was talking to he took off his feet shoes and he bowed himself down to the ground it was Jehovah God in another form the same God but changing his expression how he veils himself how he's expressing himself God cannot change his nature but his form constantly he's the same yesterday today and forever and he always comes in an unexpected way and so they miss him every single time he doesn't come into the big churches with the all the fancy religious you know paraphernalia Jesus didn't come with robes and and degrees and all of these things he came as a as a man that was born to a woman that wasn't even married pregnated by some Soldier they said he came he never went to schools and got a college degree he was somebody they didn't understand where he came from they didn't know what was going on but you know what he did do he came exactly according to the word and they missed it because of the traditions of Grandpa it's exact same thing do today Jesus Christ comes and he expresses himself he says yeah but grandpa said like I love my grandfathers but I'm telling you I'm not following what grandpa said I'm following what the Vindicated word said every age God's come down in a different expression it was God in Ezekiel it was God in Isaiah it was God expressing himself coming down through these different prophets these different Ministries And Then There came one who is not just an expression of a part of God an expression of a characteristic of God it was the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man the Lord Jesus Christ the Supreme creator of heavens and earth standing on this Earth rejected by man forsaken by God and made a sin offering for The Souls of men oh you look at that cross you look at that that man there bleeding and bloody and dripping and and and rejected that was the Lord Jesus Christ that was the prophecy being fulfilled and you know what everybody was ashamed to be identified with him but it was exactly according to the prophetic word for that day but they failed to recognize it as Jesus said to them on the road to amaz this oh fools and slow of heart don't you know the prophecies didn't you know this was supposed to happen exactly this way everything's exactly according to prophecy nothing here is out of order and you're ashamed and you're embarrassed and you're confused and you're sad and you don't know what's going on oh why don't you know the word concerning your day he never changes his nature only his form he's the same yesterday today and forever he he was the same one that was in Noah he was the same one that was in Moses he was and you got to keep the continuity right because you look at Noah and you say oh well here's Noah and uh we see that God destroyed the World by a flood and God doesn't change so he's going to destroy the world by a flood again it's like you're so close you were really close there but it's he said he wouldn't do it by a flood but he will destroy the world he is a God of Justice he will judge sin he will do that but he did it the first time with water this time it's with fire and so you you got to not just run it intellectually through your mind and say well God doesn't change this is the way it's going to be you line it up with the word you look for that characteristic of his nature and you'll begin to see how God's going to act and what's beautiful is once you figure out how God likes to do things you can get right in the spot where he's going to move you can position yourself so that you're there when he walks through the door if you can recognize how he does things here in the sermon identified Christ of all ages Topeka Kansas I've been going through this series and if if you want to have a Revival just slip over there it's it's quite a time he says remember God changes his form in morphe the Greek word means he puts on a different mask like in Carmen or something or Shakespeare's play he's like an actor he Chang es his form and that's those prophets were that was God in those prophets Jesus said so you condemn me for calling myself the Son of God and you call them Gods who the word of God came to and I'm the Son of God how do you condemn me the same thing is today it's God manifested in flesh the message of the hour the light of the day this message of the hour is Jesus Christ expressed to a people it's the light of the hour it's God manifested in flesh you see God didn't just want to send a word to manifest it on paper God sent a word to manifest in flesh in that same sermon he says dear Jesus the immaculate son of the Living God who is here tonight in the form of the Holy Spirit changed his form and came down and revealed his word right in human flesh Men Women of all walks of life showing that he is still alive he is the same yesterday today and forever when you recognize that this message that we've received when you recognize what Jesus Christ said in Luke 17:30 he says even thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is being revealed and you begin to run the continuity you get that Keystone and you begin to see how it connects together and then you see that Prophet stand there and speak and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart of the people that be behind him you recognize that's not a man doing that that's almighty God come down and changed his form changed his expression found a vessel he could get a hold of and expressed himself as God in flesh the revealing of the son of man brother brandom says I'm identified with a group that knows that he's unveiled that know he's the same yesterday today and forever and that it's not fanaticism it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm so happy to be identified with a people that we call message Believers I'm so happy to be identified with people that are considered Fanatics to the world that's considered Holy Rollers because that's been the way it was every time in the days of Jesus there was only a couple who recognized who he was and everybody else rejected him but there was a people that said to whom would we go you have the Word of Life they re recognize this expression they said this is God that is expressing himself to us they recognize that word of life and I'm happy to be identified with a people who has recognized the word of life that has been expressed God in his enm morphy again unveiling himself and making himself known to his people the great king who laid aside his glory yet a little while and the world won't see me no more but I'll be veiled to them but ye shall see me people always miss it they can't see it they can't see that it was God in Martin Luther they can't see it was God in John Wesley they can't see that this was God coming down Through the Ages fulfilling his word and and God God has allotted a certain word for every age he's a certain word he says this will be fulfilled in this time this will be fulfilled in this time this will be fulfilled in this time and it's an allotted word for each age and then to fulfill that allotted word he sends right here he says uh somehow we don't know how it ever happened but in each one of these ages as we look back upon Thy word and we see that there was an anointing come in that age that fulfilled that word there's an anointing that's released to fulfill the word of that day in the days of the the lion anointing there was an anointing released with that in the days of the ox anointing on the people they would offer themselves as a sacrifice they'd run to the stake they they they they gather the the the Ste the altar where they would be burnt as a as a burnt at the Stak they'd grab the wood and they'd pile it around themselves just they were rejoicing they would long to give their life as a sacrifice you say how could they do that there was an anointing there was an anointing that age to fulfill that Ox anointing where the church would go down and and and die in the grave there would be a a death burial and resurrection of the church we see these things happening we see it going down and you you look at you're like how could they do that there was an anointing yeah yeah well how could Martin Luther stand there and re reject that entire Catholic World system and push it back there was an anointing that came H to him under a man anointing to fulfill that and to accomplish that you say how could that be there was an anointing that came to fulfill that right in this day it's the eagle age and there's an anointing that's been released on a people that will take a flight from this Earth there's been an anointing released you say oh how could I be the bride how could I fulfill these things there's an anointing that's been released to fulfill the promised word a lotted to this age oh it's God in morphe God sends a word he says there would be a a virgin born son of the Living God that would come there would come one and then he sent an anointing upon a virgin that brought forth that son of the Living God there's an anointing that's released in each age to fulfill the word for that age that's right now if you look at the word for this age you begin to see what the anointing upon your life life is going to accomplish not trying to accomplish going to be accomplished because God will have a bride and he will not fail he's not going to get halfway and then quit God has never quit on a job he started he that hath begun a good work will be faithful to complete it he knows exactly what he's doing and he's going to bring forth a bride that will be the Glorious spotless Bride of the son of the Living God without spot without wrinkle sinless and justified in his sight now here in the Mighty God unveil before us the prophet says he broke every denominational ve Veil every sound barrier that sound that says oh that's fanaticism he broke right through that that sound Berry come out there and said oh them people are crazy he broke right through that Veil yes he did oh you can't do it you're another nothing but a bunch of Fanatics he broke right through that no such a thing as Divine Healing he broke right through that oh my for he was the word he he you can't conquer the word of God and there he stands yet tonight the mighty conqueror since he broke every Methodist and Baptist and Presbyterian and every other kind of aail he stands among his people tonight unconquered by Traditions I don't care what somebody's told you what somebody said the same Lord Jesus Christ that lived 2,000 years ago is here right here this morning I don't care who said something who started a tradition he is unconquered and he Remains the Same whatsoever you have need of ask and you shall receive it oh but I heard somebody say this and I heard somebody say that forget the Traditions forget those veils that try to Veil him off and say you can't access him there is a veil that has been rent there's been a way provided where you can come directly Before the Throne of God and come boldly to ask for mercy and Grace oh he says and I remember they tell me when a plane breaks that sound barrier there's no limit to its speed and I'm telling you when you break that traditional barrier Jesus is way back and he isn't now do you realize that Jesus Christ is not the god of 2,000 years ago he's not the man Jesus Christ is not the god uh that walked around in Galilee that's not where he's at no if you and you you watch this so closely if you try to worship a historical Jesus of 2,000 years ago we'll crucify the Son of God aresh that's right he's not back there he's right here he's the same yesterday today and forever he is alive they did not kill him and lay him in a grave and he stayed there he rose up from that grave and he came and he said he would be here this morning and he's never failed to keep a promise he said here if I'm telling you when you can break that traditional barrier that Jesus is way back and he isn't now when you find he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no limit to what God could do right here in this convention when you recognize him the same when you catch the Keystone of the Bible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he does not change then you can access unlimited power here this morning morning oh he says show the world what they need a a Revival that'll be filled and baptized with the presence of the Living God and morphe in veiling himself into human flesh what flesh what flesh is God wanting to Veil himself into and change his mask into well he did it in the prophet we see that we recognize that but that wasn't the that wasn't the end of the mission that was that was the beginning of the mission the end of the mission was to have a people that God could have preeminence in what God began to do to show that I can take a hold of a vessel and I can enveil myself into that person and it's now God in flesh that's what his purpose is to accomplish in a bride in this day but you know what it'll be so simple because God comes in Simplicity people will look right at it and they'll laugh at it they'll call it the crazy Neighbor Next Door they'll call it and it'll be Jesus Christ in a Manger it'll be Jesus Christ walking around with a bunch of fishermen catching fish and and just having a good time talking with him it'll be Jesus Christ unveiled in a human being he says veiling himself into human flesh oh Hallelujah I believe it he broke every barrier every Veil every nothing could hide his presence when people gets hungry in their heart there's a veil ready to be broke and you can depend on that he rent every veil by his great Holy Spirit and here he stands tonight the mighty conqueror same yesterday today and forever Healing The Sick baptizing the Believers just as he always did and he's the mighty conqueror doomed devils are on the Run yes sir they always are when he's around I want to testify this morning he's around and that devil that's been tormenting your family that devil that's been haunting you he is shaking in his boots right now he's a doomed devil that's on the run because he recognizes that Jesus is the same he knows his power is here this morning and he's terrified of the possibility that you might recognize the same doomed devils are on the Run Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him that's right what God did once he'll do again we which alive and remain shall not prevent them which are asleep oh but we shall be caught up together we shall be changed there's coming a change to our Earthly bodies now to kind of bring this to a close and look back here at the where we started we seeing that behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven now we know there's that's coming we know it's going to happen but before that happens behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so we can see how how how this is supposed to run together but if we run back in the scriptures we can go back and see he says as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah and Abraham up in the mountain that same situation is going to play out again that which hath been will be and we look at that and we see over here Abraham the elected group up here on the mountain set aside with God we see over here lot the the the the the foolish virgin the halfway believer he's down there in Sodom and he's surrounded by all these unbelievers and we see that God said he would send fiery judgment to destroy that the day is going to come it'll burn as an oven so we see this pattern here's lot here's Sodom and Gomorrah here's lot over here there's Abraham up in the mountains and there comes a man walking up the road was it a man man absolutely he ate he drank he talked with Abraham he discerned the thoughts and intents of the hearts of Sarah behind him and he said I am going to visit you who was that man now that right there was the son of man now I don't have time but if you want to take a good 45 minute study we can get into it but if you go to questions and answers they asked him now I thought the pillar fire was the son of man and I heard somebody say you were the son of man and now I'm confused he says well let me explain he says that Pillar of Fire is actually not the son of man and he breaks into it and it's a really beautiful study he says that Pillar of Fire is not the son of man he says but you see Jesus Christ he was a man and that Pillar of Fire comes into the man and when the pillar of fire comes into the man now you have the son of man which is the logos the word in a body yes you see that Prophet was not the son of man and that Pillar of Fire was not the son of man but when that Pillar of Fire came down the word took control of a body we seen the thoughts and intents of the heart expressed we seen it was almighty God it was the son of man revealing himself expressing himself through that prophetic Ministry it was a son of man revealing the son of man that's the Pillar of Fire the logos the word expressed in a fleshly body that is the son of man and there coming up the road to Abraham in the tent was the pillar of fire in a body that was the son of man and he told them these things and Jesus says As it was in the days of lot as it was when Abraham was there in the mountains as it was in that time so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man just before that ending of time just before the closing of the earth there's going to be revealing just like it was then and now I want you to look at the timing it's so beautiful he says now Sarah and Abraham they they got we down till they was 100 years old and I can see Abraham he just after you've gone through Elohim son of man coming and visiting Abraham and telling him these things he says and I can see Abraham get up the next morning he said dear you know Sarah Sarah was a beautiful woman and she was young when she was young and he said you know dear your hair is turning dark again I see the wrinkles going out from under your face since last night she said well Dad I noticed that your shoulders are straightening up and oh my a few hours later he was going to get a bucket of water or something come back and he said Sarah you look beautiful she said why Abraham you look like you did when I married you he turned them back when did that happen the next morning after the son of man came walking up to their door we're not looking for another day we're not looking for another age we're not looking for another messenger we know that after that revealing of the son of man comes the next morning his body change says again he says Abraham just m Abraham the next morning getting up and he says why Sarah you know your your wrinkles are going out of your face says it over here again he says Abraham said the next morning he looked up and he said Sarah honey your eyes are turning black again your hair the Grays are leaving from it now why is that important because it shows us a pattern it shows us where we're living at today in 2024 he says here in Easter seal he says the he says if you look he says and remember after that sign was manifested fully to Abraham in his group the next thing come was that change what's the next thing to come friends are we looking for another president or another prime minister are we looking for some great Earthly thing to happen are we looking for no that's not what we're looking at we've seen the sign of the revealing of the son of man we know the hour that we're living in when we know the next thing to happen the thing that's going to happen tomorrow morning is a body change that's where we're living at how can I declare that with authority because God doesn't change and I can see what he did and I know He'll Do It Again scripture says well let me read this here and Abraham said rather that it was Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus said as it was in the days of that day Jehovah the son of man again in the form of prophetic like he was would return again at the last days just before your bodies is going to be changed Genesis 19:27 says and Abraham got up early in the morning do you know what morning that was that was body change morning he got up early in the morning and he went to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah and there was nothing but smoke coming up Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Keystone of the Bible is that God doesn't change and we see here Abraham meets with the son of man revealing the thoughts and intents of the heart the next day his Earthly body is changed and he looks out the window and there's smoke coming out out of Sodom and Gomorrah that's where we're living at today we have seen the revealing of the son of man we have seen the expression of Jesus Christ made to us we have heard that he wants to do a work in our life he wants that word to come and change our mortal body he wants to transform us and we're not waiting for a million years for that to happen we're not looking for it to be some other age we know that right now where we're at the timing of God's Bible there's not the prophecies that remain for the coming of the Lord can be fulfilled within five minutes of this time right now Prophet said that 60 years ago I think we're there he says within 5 minutes of this time the Lord Jesus would come he says and not break one Prophecy of the scripture so where are we at going home time you say oh well you know this is going on in politics and I've got this happening at my job I've got the forget it those things don't matter you know it's interesting to see what's happening in Israel it's interesting to see those things but that's not our Focus our focus is to look up because our Redemption is drawing nigh that's the hour we're living in get your focus on the right thing we have been in this hour we're at the climax the closing point of the history of this Earth and people are worried about who's going to be president come on recognize where you're at recognize what's happening and get your focus and your heart centered on Jesus Christ we have come to this hour this is the day where the changing of our mortal bodies is to happen behold that day cometh that shall burn as an oven it's going to happen it's going to happen but just before that there's going to be Elijah the prophet that's going to come well he came friends and right now there's just a few moments of closing time before the changing of these Earthly bodies and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with the Lord and those which are asleep in the graves they shall raise up from that dead they shall be changed and We Shall Gather together to meet him in the air well how do I know this how do I declare this how can I say this cuz God doesn't change I can see what he did I can see the position I can see the hour and I can recognize this is the day this is where we're living it's going home time oh and I so thankful that we've received a word in this day a message of the hour that has given us what we have need of to take a Rapture I'm not looking for something else I have received everything that I have need of through that visit of the son of man to change my Earthly body I'm not going down to Sodom to ask for anything that they have I don't want it I don't need it I've got everything I need I'm satisfied with the visitation that's come in this day let's just stand to our feet this morning [Applause] Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change he said that he would bring judgment on sin and he will he said that there's going to be a people a mystery that we shall not all sleep he will not fail to keep that word that's where we're living at right here this morning the god that heals the god that saves the god that changes your mortal body you know you don't have to wait for the Rapture to get your healing that's right am you see the same power that's going to change you right then is the same power that's in you right now because everything that you have need of for this Earthly journey is given you when you receive the Holy Ghost even the Rapture is in you right then so the same power that's going to heal you when you get to the Rapture is the same power that can heal you right here this morning don't let them pass you by don't let them just go by and and not receive re your blessing you know bar when Jesus came there to the pool of Bethesda walked up to a man and he healed him turned around and he walked out thousands of people there looking for God to move but because they didn't recognize how he came they didn't receive their healing if somebody would have been there and cried out Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me he would have stopped and turned because because they didn't recognize his presence his power was not released to them but he came just as he promised he would come God bless you this morning I I've just I had good time talking to you about the Lord and I just trust that something was said that would anchor in your heart this morning and just bless you and just want to challenge you this morning is there something you have need of I ask you have you any of you ever been healed before before that same God will do it again he doesn't change if he forgave you once he'll do it again if he healed you once he'll do it again if he filled you with the Holy Ghost he'll do it again he'll fill you as many times as you'll empty your heart out to receive him and so if you have need of something this morning you just hold it before him let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that we can trust in you Lord great is your faithfulness you will not fail to keep one promise you said that you would be the same and you said that you would be here this morning and you've kept your end of the bargain you've come we recognize your presence here among us we recognize the sweetness of your Holy Spirit Lord and there's different needs in our homes in our lives Lord in our marriages Lord there's different needs in our loved ones and our and our Earthly bodies and sickness there's all these different things and and Lord I don't even know what they are I don't really know these people but Lord You're their father you know every heart here this morning and once more Lord I don't know their needs and I can't meet their needs but you know the needs and you're the one that can supply the need so heavenly father I just ask this morning as we're here in this little simple humble service Lord a few words have been spoken to try to recognize that you're the same Lord may they recognize they have an opportunity this morning to touch thee
