everyone of your family Lord Jesus we pray Hallelujah amen amen thank you Lord God thank you musicians amen it's awesome to be in his house again and maybe you can have your seats for a moment just many out this morning I I'm sure brother Carson told me they were going to be away I actually forgot it was today but uh I believe they're gone traveling but just remember the different ones this morning amen and just say God bless you and welcome and and uh sister Patty had texted us and said she'd be out and I said oh man there goes one of my amen Corners amen just you know when one person or just even two or three are gone it's a huge huge difference and good to see brother Jeff and sister dla and just praise God for everything he's helped them do and move and just pray God will help bless them and help them settle in and amen amen before I Minister I want to uh mention something about last week's son message you know when a minister ministers any Minister you know brother Brown said ministering was like throwing out the fishnet and and then from that point on everything's up to God and I don't ever desire to uh onch christianize anybody or raise myself above anybody the least among here I'm least than them and uh so you know last Sunday's message and today is going to be part two is it was just to try to show us God's principles of working in the scriptures of what the Believers do in secret but many of you do that already so that's not to say that nobody prays for me or nobody fast that only you know that's like if you preach a sermon to Sinners if you're saved it don't apply to you if you know if if you got the Holy Ghost well like you say well you know that's not for me cuz I already got the Holy Ghost you know but uh I know many of you pray for me and some of us you've tell me that and and it's greatly appreciated amen and so it was not to meet uh to uh onsave anybody or to raise us above somebody it was just for those I believe these messages are for those that God was trying to show himself how he moves in the individual person's life and in their church or and in the bride and we're going to we're going to maybe get into that better today uh through Israel but God really works in a way that man cannot understand and and so I just want to say if you're praying and fasting thank you and God says thank you and you know I mentioned something that I don't normally mention but I mentioned that no one had ever given me money to go on a mission trip that does not mean that you should give me money this church supports the ministry and here unbelievable unbelievable we're we're about to have our meetings Len's done the books and if you seen the amount you give is is beyond belief and and if if that came across like that that that was not my intent it was just sometimes we give money for things that God never even cared about God cared about saving Souls period saving Souls period and he cared about you going ministering and we all have a Ministry and if you couldn't go to send somebody else amen and so when I get home I you know your family is your best uh you know judges you know my daughter come to me she said dad I gave you money last year to go to El Salvador I'm like uh-oh that was spanking number one and then I actually remembered you know Tommy Tims from the cattle sailb bar had actually give me money when I went to Africa and so I'm sorry that's it was not meant if you ever hear me ask you to give me money you leave leave the church that's it's not about money that's between you and God Amen so so I'm just human and and that wasn't meant that way and and uh you know but I I believe God can help those that you know need to grow in him and and different things and and uh and and me too and me too I I was ministering to myself too and believe me I really was and and uh God help us so but anyway amen let's just look in our scriptures Ephesians uh 5 we're going to read verse 32 and we'll just look right into this word and pray you'll accept my apologies if sometimes I I I I really try to never mention money but when I mention that that's don't do nothing unless you feel God leads you to do it nothing absolutely nothing amen amen just one Short scripture and and just pray for me and I pray for you and amen this is a great mystery but I speak concerning in Christ in the church Lord Jesus I pray you'll add the blessing to your word and Lord I just praise you for all that were able to come out this cold and snowy day and and bless those ones that are are traveling in away or sick Lord Jesus may you heal them and be with the preaching of the word and the hearing of the word Lord Jesus we pray amen amen you may have your seats Hallelujah I want to look in this scripture and maybe we'll go through it really fast but Ephesians 5 here 22 uh starting at 22 is talking about husbands and wives and we are not talking about that this morning at all we're a million miles from that but if if you would let me read those Scriptures it does bring out some points where it's talking about the church so starting at 22 it says wives submit yourself to your own husbands as unto the Lord and husbands is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church no okay now that's something we want to pick out if Christ ain't the head of this church well we're we're all losers and I'm the biggest one amen he's if if he ain't the head we're we're all lost so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything and husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church now we know that Christ loved the church because the Bible says that there's no greater love than a man to lay down his life for another and we know Christ did that amen so we know his love is not in question here but we're getting to a part and he gave himself for it and that he might be a that he might sanctify it and cleanse it from the washing of the word washing of the Water by the word that he might present himself a glorious Church having sorry having having not spot nor wrinkle nor any such thing but should be holy and Without Blame and so ought to men love their own wives as their own body now we know God loved us more than himself and and he that loveth himself loveth his wife loveth himself and for no man ever hateth his own flesh but nourish and cherish it even as the Lord cherishes the church now we know God's cherishing the church we feel that every day for we are members of his body and of his flesh you're going to have to excuse me for a minute sorry Hallelujah verse 31 for this cause a man to leave his mother and father and so join to his wife and the two shall be one flesh and this is a great mystery concerning Christ and the church now we want to look at the mystery and we want to look spiritually about Christ and the church and I want to pick something out on the next next verse nevertheless now God's continuing on this mystery let every one of us in particular love his wife even as himself now we already are past the love part because we know Christ loved us but this is what we are we are the wife and let the wife see that she reverence the Lord her husband now this is spiritual forget about the flesh forget about the flesh let us reverence God see that we reverence God now if you want to look into this if You' allow me to he said the meanings of reverence and and and and I know you're going to think well you know of course I reverence God but I I want to show you some people that never reverence God in the Bible because they they they never liked his decisions amen now remember he's the head and if he makes a decision and you don't like it you still got to reverence it the meanings of reverence was deep respect for someone or something a high esteem now when God sends you through a trial you're going to hold them up in high esteem say oh praise God for this trial amen high regard great respect and and min uh admiration adoration honor praise now we're going to touch on praise some affection worship we're going to touch on worship to hold in awe to hold in awe this morning to love to hold in high regard to cherish to idolize to value to treasure that's how we're supposed to look at God and I'm sure many if you do if you see if you do that you're you're perfectly we're not preaching to you we're going to the next person but I wonder in our every decision and everything that happens in our life you know the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord so when your basement floods you you you're in high esteem you praise God I can you know when you're you're fire goes flat you say oh Pray when you sight in the ditch when you get a cold you say how really I wonder because you know there's times where we we you know we're humans and so we we take things for granted and take things out of different things here let's just look at what the prophet said he said a lot of people want Jesus to be their savior but they don't want them to be their lord they want what we can get from God to make us happy but if he starts bsing us around well you can just pack salt they not interested in that see Lord means this is the prophet so Lord means he's a ruler he's the boss and he's still the ruler whether you like it or not when he's giving out candies and gifts we love them and and and and he wants to give them more than we desire them but when he starts saying well this is how you get them everything you you know in this study everything that God gives us he expects us to ask for him almost everything in secret you you will be amazed at how much God does in secret you know God help us you know we're going to read some scriptures on this but he said God's looking for nuts he wants you to be nuts to serve him and he said Just remember this it's the nut that holds everything together the Bible can be full of bolts but until you until you start acting nuts for Christ nothing's held together and you know I bet you he mentioned that nuts being held together probably like 40 times I couldn't he begin to I'm going to read some of them after he said we're NS to somebody so I'll be nuts for Christ he said Paul said he said I count it that I am a fool for Christ's sake so you know when you're in that situation you're going to be really peculiar now if we look at 1 Corinthians 4 9 and 10 and we'll pull that up if we can Vicki for this was just really really powerful to me the end of I'm not going to for for I think that God has set before us Apostles last as it was appointed unto death and here here Paul this is what I want to catch for We Are Made spectacles onto the world spectacles are not normal things a spectacle the meaning of spectacle is unusual notable or eye-catching you know we're supposed to be salty we're supposed to have our light where the world will see it even if we're not speaking we're supposed to be I catchy that that's not just in our looks but it's in how we handle our character our atmosphere around us if it is glowing with a smile and it's just like oh it's I'm so good to be happy and in your presence he said we're supposed to be spectacles onto the world and to the angel angels and onto men that's that's our that's a that's an order we're supposed to be spectacles unusual to men notable and eye-catchy you should when you're dealing in the world people should you should catch your attention that you're the best employee the most honest employee the most hardworking the most kind and Contin on the same scripture verse uh 10 it says for we are fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ and we are weak but ye are strong and you are honorable but we are despised God help us to this state and I want to look at you know I seen this post and actually Ron mevi AO had put it up and so I'm giving it I'm showing you where I found it and and it was it's a powerful thing and this is like I said I'm preaching to myself said God never looked for fans and and you know this is this applies in the church you know this ain't a one-man show you you we're all part of the movie you know specials and and amen and and and and your noise will never scare me if you stand up or move or something like it won't shut down the service we we're we're so orderly we're disorderly because it Amen brother mam said if you're if you don't have no life bury it said God never wanted fans he always wanted followers there's a big difference between fans and followers and if it would be all right for me I would share some of these he said fans are comfortable followers are committed fans are consumers followers are cont contributors fans sit in the stands but followers get in the game fans are spect ators followers are participators fans are part-time followers are fulltime fans follow the crowd followers follow Christ fans only listen to the word followers participate practice the word fans live by their feelings followers live by faith fans only want blessings followers Embrace burdens fans only want want to wear a crown followers Carry the Cross Jesus wanted fans this morning which one are you amen you know normally in a gathering I'm not saying that applies here but you know in any business you know normally in a if you had a business or a church or anything a gathering it's normally 5 or 10% of the people that do everything that needs to be done done and it's normally 90 or 95% of the people that are fans but it's only 5 or 10% that are actually making it happen amen God help us here we're going to look in touch and worship and then I'm going to go to our main example in the message here he said we're talking about Holy Ghost worship here brother Braham says that Rebecca watering the camels for for elaser that he came to take her to Isaac she didn't know she didn't know at the time she was watering the camels that she was that there even wasn't elaser she didn't know that at all but brother Brown considers that as the Holy Ghost filled Worship in the church today you know if you want to go see your Isaac maybe you need to get here and worship God maybe you need to lose your mind worshiping God and can you imagine if you just would go with me on this journey where Rebecca would water the camels that had just came across the desert by dropping the you know when we were in in uh BAH on the island of Bah they took a shower beside the road and there was a well there a SM well in a spot to L and they had just literally a a a it was it wasn't a pale but they had like a jug and it was heavy on one side and they let that down with a rope and it would flip over easy and fill with water and they they pulled it up and that's what they showered thems with and I couldn't imagine pulling a 2 L jug because if it was heavier that the Rope would be really heavy this is a woman now can you imagine her pulling up a 2L jug to water a herd of camels that had came across the desert that was not no 5 minute worship service that was no 30 minute worship service that was not even a 12- hour worship service I couldn't even begin to tell you how long it would worship take to and brother Braham said at that time she never even know she was going to see Isaac and she never even knew there was an Isaac amen and what God's trying to show us and this ain't meant to be to be to be rude or mean and and I'm going to read a scripture with this is but you get what you put into something if you go to work early and you're you're the best employee you're going to get a race am man no it's not about that but it it's not about but you're going to get from God what you put into it you know the one Church where we visited I won't tell you where it was if you were a musician in that church and you didn't get there an hour early you weren't allowed to to play and you know when we went to the churches they would unlock the door half an hour early and normally there would be 200 people outside the door and if you came more than a half an hour late well you just probably didn't get a seat or you were coming off the street backsliding but it was all part of their preparation for the service it was a part of their worship so let's look if you if we want to see so brother Brown says here he said Rebecca water and the camels was worshiping God to take her to her Lord and her master ain't that a mystery if you want to go in the Rapture worship god wow all he said the very power of the church is worshiping and the world's calling calling it fanaticism but the church worshiping will have the same power that will take the church up in the air to meet the Lord in the air that's our Prophet you thought I was just saying that Ephesians 5:28 or Ephesians 5:18 to 21 be not drunk with wine wherein there is access but this is what I want to catch on here the end of Verse 18 but be filled with the spirit in verse 19 speaking to yourself in Psalms and in hymns and spiritual songs and singing and making Melodies in your heart to God you want to go in a Rapture that's the verse to take you there giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Jesus and submitting yourself one to another now you know in worship when we're submitting ourselves to one another I don't care how you worship because it's not about me it's about you and your lord you can we all worship differently some could cry and be quiet some could shout and jump some could just sit still and shiver submitting yourself means respecting one another in the variety of God but it was still worship and worship takes time worship takes time God help us God help us and when we look into this next example I want you to remember this the meaning of reverence we are to reverence God as our Lord and our head as our ruler now I'll tell you ahead of time time the people never even came close to reverence but here here in the Bible it was the children of Israel were in Egypt and they had went there from Joseph during this famine and their family had Grew From one family to Millions two million amen and thank you and uh and There Rose up a king that knew not Joseph and uh and here the people the Lord the Bible says that the Lord heard the groans and the prayers of the people and I want to tell you something God hears your groans this morning and your prayers this morning guarantee you he hears them we see that example all the time in the prophet when when people start praying unbeknownst to him I love this part of the tapes listen to tapes and and he's doing a prayer line or preaching or doing something else he oh oh you prayed just 5 seconds ago and now went through the internet rate to Glory went through all the angels went to the top boss at the the the throne and was sent down and even brother Brenham had to process it and it took seconds amen but here the people were praying but what I want to show you this morning and I I'm not trying to be forgive me I I apologize I'm not trying to be down or discouraged or or to I'm trying to show you the reality and facts of God is God maybe many times don't answer our prayers like we think and expect that he should here Israel was praying I I want to even bring this part out you know God said what well let me just go back to my I got it down here God said in Genesis 15 that he would bring the people out of slavery in 400 years but in Exodus 12 he actually did it in 430 what happened you have to ask God that cuz I don't know I know God's time's perfect but it wasn't like he said it was going to be that's that's just flat Bible but you know God had a purpose and his interpretation is different than us even reading it so watch this he said Mo God Called Moses and Aaron and they went to pharaoh and Pharaoh gave them a very simple message in in uh Exodus 51 he said let my people go to the Wilderness that we may hold a feast and a sacrifice for God and here God had had called Moses when he called Moses back in the scriptures he said I've heard the prayer request of the children of Israel and I've heard their moanings and groanings and I'm going to deliver them he told Moses I'm going to answer their prayers and the Israelite people wished that God hadn't answered the prayers cuz it said they were bitter rude upset mad disgusted and would have killed Moses see God was answering Israel's pray prayer because he sent them a deliverer Prophet Moses and their laboring and suffering got far worse and you would pray for healing or salvation or or something and like a miracle that God to give you new more money or something else and God will take what you already got and you say oh wow kind of a god of my servant he would just seeing if you were really his Moses asked God in Exodus 5 he said here here Moses talked to the Lord now now this was the Moses was a God to Pharaoh he said Lord whereof how thou sent so evily retreated and treated this people why hast thou even sent me as a deliverer now I got a question for you that was respect that was reverence that was the highest reverence that Moses could give God see the reason that happened was they didn't expect God to be that way they had a pre- agenda plan and that happens in all of our Lives we think we'll pray for our lost loved ones and they go farther in sin we say God what are you doing God knows exactly what he's doing he said they never understood God and how that their answer to their prayer Moses spake again to the children of Israel and they wouldn't even hearken they wouldn't even show M ma Moses respect for the anguish of Spirit and the cruelty of the burden from the answering of the prayer see when you pray they thought God would bring them out in some miraculous Miracle glory and the people hated it how God was doing it they actually hated Moses for it how could the children of Israel show such reverence to God and blame and fault for this evil and cruel burden that had been brought onto them because Moses because God had sent Moses that they could go into the Wilderness and worship god well I want to give you a comparison if you come and you dedicate your life and you you do things like come early to church and and you shout cry or pray or raise your hand or sing a special in the worship service you might get evil retreated burdens bondage because God's way of building character was different than the children of Israel could even imagine and I I want to also bring this out before we go through the scriptures you know it wasn't until after all the scriptures we're going to go through it wasn't until after all this happened watch this this is important it wasn't until Exodus 7 after all the burdens came on the children of Israel the God told only Moses that I'm hardened in Pharaoh's heart to bring Glory unto myself and he never told the people the people had no idea when they were being beaten for making more brecks beaten because watch how Pharaoh says this in verse five of chapter 5 Pharaoh said well behold you have so much spare time that you would want to go and do a sacrifice and worship your god well you can collect your own straw and make the same amount of bricks and in verse seven why we will no more give straw to make bricks as here for let them go and collect the straw for themselves and verse eight and the Tails of the bricks which thou make make henceforth shall be laid upon them and thou shalt not diminish ought thereof and and literally Pharaoh brought over thas maskers this was the answering of the prayer Pharaoh brought over task Masters to beat the children of Israel for praying wow that's a little different than we thought let more work be verse n let more work be laid upon the men that they may labor therein and let them regard vain words and the thas maskers of the people went out and their officers and spake unto the people thus saith pharaoh I'll give you no straw you ever wonder how God answers our prayers and why because God is our Lord and He all knows the beginning from the end and he's got a whole plan here but the children of Israel don't understand it a bit and I believe many times that us living here in this day we wonder actually me and L we're talking about driving here and I won't mention it but I said I'm surprised we're still here and and you know the state of the Canada is social and and you know and the things that are going on it's like but God knows wh why why are we living through this garbage can of disgust filth and sin well at that time it was to bring more glory to God it was be a great powerful oaking God help us he said and I'm going to read through these if it's all right verse 13 and the tasmac hasten onto them to fulfill your work and your daily task as then there was as was when there was straw and the officers of the children of Israel which were the Tymers set over them and they were beaten God was answering their prayers God promised to answer their prayers this is how he did it he beat them and demanded thereof that you fulfill the task of making both the bricks of yesterday and today there henceforth now right about that time Israel wasn't sure if they wanted God to be the Lord they were thinking we may be better reconsider in verse 15 and the officers of the children of Israel came and cried onto Pharaoh saying there thereof dealest thou with thy servants and 16 and there is no straw given unto thy servants and they say unto us make brick Behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is of thine own people now he here's the world saying it's your fault because you prayed but he said unto them ye are Idol and ye are Idol therefore ye say let us go and sacrifice unto our Lord so here I'm trying to show you that and God's trying to show you is anytime you do anything for God he didn't promise it'd get better amen this is a Battle Ground we we're we we know the end of the story we know we've won the war we know we're going in the Rapture but you're in the front lines right now and just because you knocked down a couple Devils there's another whole Fleet coming at you the prophet said that all the guns are a aimed on the bride of Christ and hearing said just because you wanted to sacrifice just because you wanted to come to church and worship God you'll run in the ditch have a car accident you say why I'm going to church God hallelujah verse 19 and the officers of the children of Israel did not see that they were evil in evil case and after it was said ye not minimize ought of the bricks daily task and verse 20 and they met Moses and Aaron watch this this is like the church meeting the pastor or the prophet or the Evangelist or whoever you'd want to say and they met Moses and Aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh and they said unto them Lord look upon you and judge because you have made our savior to a a Bo a to a horde in the eyes of pharaoh and the eyes of his servants and ye have put the sword upon us to slay us there's there's there's the people that Moses was called to to to by God to lead out and the people are accusing them of You're a murderer and you've set the guns on us to kill us with the sword if there had been a vote about right down of Moses I think you would have lost the election and Moses returned unto the Lord therefore and he said why we read this and said Lord why hast thou so evily re entreated this people and why hast thou even sent me now now just think about that now let's look at but reverence respect dignity admire highest steam none of these are playing into effect here verse 23 and since I came to pharaoh and spake in thy name here here's Moses communion with God and saying wh why is it going this way since I came to pharaoh and spake in thy name in Jesus Christ's name thou Hast done evil that was answered prayer to this people and neither hast thou delivered thy people at all why doesn't God answer prayer because God has a greater plan out of another time to bring more glory to himself I mean this is is this not a perfect example of it amen let's let's let's look back at this I mean if you forgive me to go back here in my notes reverence deep respect High esteem high regard great re admire adoration honor praise hold in high regard ch perish idolize value and treasure Moses is threatening God said why did you do her we don't want to put Moses down because many times we do that say God why why why am I why is this happening God I've asked God why I think if you're breathing you've asked God why God why did I why did this happen why did why am I in the Str in Exodus 6 in Exodus 61 and then the Lord said unto Moses now shall thou see what I will do to Pharaoh for with the strong hand shall I let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of the land now I want to show you something when God revealed this to to Moses the children of Israel were still getting beaten and they never got this word they never got it there was no way that Moses could preach to a million people that were being beaten in slavery they had to trust Moses and they were struggling with that part I don't I don't blame him I would have been too I would have been the first one with a stone to throw at Moses you know why I can can say that cuz I'm a human amen and God spake unto Moses and said onto him I am the Lord verse three and I appeared unto Abraham and Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of the Lord God Almighty now I want you to show you something here excuse me here's God telling him that I appeared onto Abraham Isaac and Jacob but by God Almighty but I'm going to do something different for you but by my name Jehovah was I not known unto them Jehovah is provider Jehovah Gyra my provider he said I'll be known as Jehovah to you where I wasn't even known that way to them and verse five and he said I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel and the Egyptians whom the Egyptians keep in bondage and I have redeemed my Covenant and therefore the children of Israel for I am the Lord and I will bring them out under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will ride rid you out of their burdens and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgment now now now that that's that sounds pretty positive let's go to verse n and Moses preached to the children of is Israel uhoh but they hearkened not onto Moses for the anguish of Spirit and the cruelty of their bondage in that service there was no amens it was Stone I don't believe there wasn't one person there that believed has anything changed we're still people God ain't changed amen and so this message just helps us to understand why are you going through what you're going through well we know how this end turned out that the children of Israel were delivered and they were paid for their back slavery and they they literally spoiled all of the wealth of Egypt and we're delivered in a Great and Mighty powerful hand and so will we be delivered but our battle is for us to to to to mature and character and that don't change what God's doing because you're going through the worst battle don't mean God ain't answering your prayer you might say but God I can't pay the hydro B tomorrow but maybe God will pay three in a row amen the only way we can get the answer is to make them our Lord and in the and the Heat of the battle and when the bullets are going by you and maybe even hitting you you got to say God you're it I'm going to read some quotes here where brother Brown talked about your attitude towards your lord and my question is did the children of Israel have the right mental attitude when the hardships and cruel bondage and evil came towards them when they had to keep when they didn't have straw and they had to make the same amount of bricks and that was God answering their prayer to let us go free and worship you I I I would question that the children of Israel when they were going through their burden they kind of lost their interest about having a sacrifice in the wilderness they got to well maybe it ain't so bad if they just bring us a straw we'll just keep making bricks here the prophet said this multiple times and I put up five or six he said the right mental attitude he said all along here he said if you understand what I mean it's a right mental attitude towards God Divine promises will bring it to pass if you start bossing God around you're going to get nothing from God if you don't have reverence and respect and high esteem and honor and adoration and all those things that call with reverence remember the Bible said this is a great mystery concerning Christ and the church and if God's the Superhead power is he's not on no Eagle trip but he's still the boss and he ain't going to have some little wimpy two-year-old coming along saying change the rules and rewrite this because I don't like how you're doing it you're going to get forgotten about here's another example he said listen to me listen to this carefully he said and I say this with reverence this is the prophet really making a point is that all right listen to me listen to this and I say this reverently and quietly so you can remember what God will do the right mental attitude to every promise of God will bring it to pass he said remember and don't forget this quotation this is a prophet he's driving these things home when he says things like this remember the attitude the right meal attitude to any Divine promise in the Bible will bring it to pass don't start dictating God God hurry up but maybe say the same thing say God I know you're more than able and your perfect times are coming look at the difference of the reproach he said if God watch this he said if God is his God and if God word is no good then go then God is no good he's no better than his word and I'll say this that God keeps every word that he said and every promise that he said and if you'll take the right mental attitude towards every Divine promise that God ever made he'll bring it to pass if you just take the right attitude and believe it with all your heart God help me God help us that when things aren't the way exactly like you think they should be at that time they're exactly how they're supposed to be by God's desire the Bible clearly tells us in the prophet clearly taught us that there's nothing out of syn for God even the most evil devils in the world are working right in tune for God they're helping them bring everything to pass perfectly they're like a tool in his wrench and he say oh yeah they're thinking they're the baked cheese and they're working at they're lining all God's program up perfectly but so many times as Believers we don't understand it now watch here another example he said now the word of God when it's written in the Bible is his word to us and every promise is the same power for the creation behind and the word of God that the word of God did in the beginning and if we believe it to be the word of God it depends on the the ground that the seed falls on that's you individually he said if it falls on ground that can create and grow with moisture and nourishment and around the great Promises of God it will bring forth the promises of Bible just as it said the right mental attitude towards the Divine promise of God will bring it to pass and you'll look at it and it'll take care of the word just right because it's an infinite God spoke it see if we have the right clay if we build the right atmosphere you know if we have the soil to seed connection conversion God will have no problem fulfilling his word but God demands respect God demands reverence and anybody that thinks they're going to passs God around you know you know you see even you know in our world today you know like God could you see people that oh my goodness it's just hilarious they think they're going to blaspheme God and their very next breath is coming from God it's so Insanity you know there's things on the online where you can see people that blasphemed God and they died within seconds literally one of them was at the UN and they were blaspheming God's people the the the Israel nation and all that and he fell off the podium and died that's in our day God is still God he's the same as yesterday today and forever you want to see God move God's moving everywhere you know Esther let me this ain't part of my notes or my plan you know Esther told you that little testimony you should have lost your mind over it I I if you don't think so when you come you know me and Lan we were even talking today and we were talking last week and we want to have everybody come out to our place on Tuesday or Thursday night and fellowship but we only want to have two or three at a time so we can actually talk to everybody you should look at the tractor that run over our dog now I'll just tell you what like this is no offense brother Tim but me and Tim were talking about it when the person there that seen it wasn't there and Tim said he said now dad the tractor didn't really run over over the dog because you know like Dad if the tractor run over the dog he'd be squished like a pancake and I was there with Tim and I couldn't help but agree with them and so I come back to challenge Moses on his testimony of God and Jared said this he said well I can tell you this Dad the dog was sticking out both sides sides of the tire and the tractor bounced on the seat when I went over the dog oh that I'm not going to to tell you what I would look like if the tractor ran over me and bounced and that dog literally ran in the house and was still running up and downstairs the same day that's not even possible even me and Tim don't think it's possible but mes still tells us it is possible you see it's like this you know it's like if your wife tells you something I say but I'm only a human man I can only believe so much but when it comes to God it's different amen and so God did all this to the Israelites to make his name more wonderful and more glorious and more fantastic in in every way and and and it was all about God God it wasn't about making Israel glorious it was about making God glorious and and when when they finally left Egypt Pharaoh said get out of here take everything you want we just just leave amen amen Luke 18 1-8 and and I I I need to read this to to show how God does things in secret and so our personal life with God and that's an individual walk is all about what you do in secret everything is about the the bible promises this is that what you do in secret he will reward you openly that's I mean I would take that promise you want to see something happen just deal with God in secret and God will take care of the rest here in Luke 181 Jesus is speaking in Parables unto them to this end and he said man ought to pray and not faint you know we read scriptures last week is you should pray without ceasing pray all the time you should be in a in a I don't mean kneeling but I mean in a a a thought of prayer and watch this this is a story he says and there was a city judge which feared not God neither regarded men and there was a widow woman of the city and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversaries and he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself he said there I don't even fear God and neither do I regard this woman or any man but she's driving me she's bothering me did you can you imagine praying so much that God said they're bothering me brother Dale's praying so much he's messing up the internet in heaven you're disturbing our our daily government ranks and here he said yet because this wible troubleth me I will answer her prayer and avenge her lest she continue coming wear me out I don't believe any of us has ever wore God out but this is actually now watch this but this is actually God Jesus Christ using this for an example hello for an example an example and the Lord said hear ye these unjust judge and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he beareth long with them what kind of a god are we serving amen I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall we even find people praying on the earth wow you know the Bible says you have not because you asked not God help us I want to show you another example if if this is all right in my throat I'm I'm actually got herbal tea here to keep me so I don't completely go horse and then brother M or Jared would have to come out and preach here we see an example and this is a quote of Elijah when when the Syrian Army was coming down to surround him and the King wanted to uh take him captive because they couldn't understand God amen and one of the people the Syrian government the Syrian King brought his army together and he was convinced this is an evil King a pagan King he was convinced that there was a spy or a traitor in their midst because everything they did to destroy God's people backfired on them I want to tell you something it's exactly the same today you can just rest peace and ly you know if you go in the ditch when you're going home from here say praise God the 18-wheeler didn't run over me it ran over the next car or something you know it can always be worse amen hallelujah and so here uh the one of the pag this we need to watch this we're are we Believers and we're Holy Ghost filled now here's a pagan evil King and one of his army men said King I got to tell you something there's a prophet in that land and he tells the Israelite King what you even think in your bedroom now that's what you call a Believer he was in the first steps of conversion they again you know the story The the king and the government they said well let's go get that guy and surround them and the Syrian Army came down to to surround them and here the the Elijah was with his servant and the the servant woke up and he see he wasn't a Believer yet like he was hanging around Believers cuz he liked their friendship but he wasn't really like he had a couple more steps to go and he woke up and he told Elight he said oh Lord he said we're surrounded by the army of Syria we're finished a pancake he said why Elijah woke up and he looked out and he said oh he said there's more with them than there be with us you know I want to tell you a story I was listening to it last night and and Len heard me to hear it and this this is this is just for what it's worth I was planning on sharing it today but I I actually it it came to me and I feel L you know there was a story of a man that came to a a little country church and I believe this is a true story and when he got to the church he was going to preach on missions and he was going to preach on going to all the world and preach the gospel for people to get saved and when he got there it was a cold blizzardy night really miserable weather like it was uh two Wednesdays ago was minus 20 it was unbelievable and all the people there were like 80 in over and he thought oh my goodness what am I preaching this for this this don't apply to anybody here none of these people are going to and he felt still let he felt led I we actually listened to it last night he said I felt led he said I still preached the message and he said they had a pipe organ there and there was a boy that pumped the air into it and and when he finished his message he said who will go that here's God calling for Laborers and the in the field of the weak field of the sheeps and he said who will go and spread the gospel and the little boy said I'll go I'll go to the mission field just a little squirt like Jared's boys and so the the story goes farther he he actually did grow up and he went and he went to be a medical doctor and he went to the mission field as a medical doctor he was there for many years but he could actually you know Help the People physically and preach the gospel and when there was one of the tribes or one of the people there in the country which just happens on a regular basis I'm actually actually talking to a missionary right now that's in North G and one of these days on Wednesday night or something I'm going to read some of the stuff he sends me is just unbelievable and he's never ever asked me for a penny but if he don't baptize 50 people a week it's like an unusual low week he has it's just it's just wild what he tells me uh just beyond belief amen he's driving around North Ghana but their Muslim present is very heavy there and so there's times where they'll have a whole church or people want to get baptized and the moslim won't let them go in their river by the damn or something and so this this is a reality okay and so the king of the One Tribe or the people there they told the doctor they said we're coming down the you know you such and such a day and he said we're going to take care of you uh your hindrance to us here in this area and so the now the reason you can tell this story and they and actually I I have the guy's name I'm not making this up this is this guy breathed this guy lived I have his name it had to be on my phone but he wrote kept a diary and so the day came and he was praying to God he said God you know this is why I'm here and you know I mean he could have been in North America making thousands of dollars and he's there making nothing and it just saved and he said you know whatever God and so they came and you know came and went and they were still alive and later on that same guy came and got saved and he said hey he said you know you sent me a note you know a year ago and you were going to come down and kill us all he said what happened it's the exact same thing that happened here in Elijah see God God never changed if he changed he only changed in your mind he didn't change your God might have change but not Jehovah God never changed and he said oh yeah he said we came down but he said when we come down to encamp your house and the people around you he said there was 39 of the biggest Angel soldiers that we've ever seen in our life camped around about them and so he came back to the very same church like this is years later like I mean he he's not traveling every week to the missioni and he comes back to this very same church where he was a small boy and he's telling this testimony and the secretary of the church comes up and he says could you give me the date the date that they were coming down to do you harm he said I sure can he opens up his diary and he said it was on such and such a date right here boom he said we had3 people at church that day at prayer meeting 39 people that day were the angels that were somewhere else in prayer 39 days that's I can give you the guy's name just after services on my phone and here Elijah says to his servant how do you say his servant's name he says oh buddy he said there's more with us than be with them and he says he says well I I don't know what kind of glasses you're wearing but he said this whole mountains is encircled with the Syrian Army and he and Elijah went to God he said God could you please open that poor dumb boy's eyes and he opened his eyes and there was a great Heavenly force of angels around him and you know the story Elijah walked right out to them and God smoted him with blindness and said who you looking for Elijah and he said oh well follow me I'll take you to him you had that just happened in the Bible times well I just showed you another example that just happened on the mission field what you do in secret you know those people in that church that were there the 39 praying they had no idea no communication no connection or nothing I can show you I send the things it's on my phone that that was happening but what they were doing in secret God was doing openly amen if we ever catch that understanding we'll be at perfect rest perfect peace you don't have to worry about your lord and King you just you just have to you just fall into complete trust and obedience and the Bible smoked them blind and he said that settles it he said they they were here's a prophet talking this is this is right before he dies in 65 said the Bible said he smok them blindness he said that settles it the people are so spiritually blind today it's not brother Dale ministering this message it's God ministering this message he's trying to show you I'm still God the same yesterday and forever everything that God ever gave to the church it's still there he never took any of it away every all the promises and that are all for the Holy Ghost filled Believers if you're a Believer they apply amen they're all yours they're up to you to get them all you got to do is go into the enemy's Camp take back what he's took from you amen the great exceedingly great and precious promises are all yours you just got to cross the River Jordan and step into the water he said that's why the the people are so spiritually blind today though the Lord God came down in the midst of the people and do anything and the things that he promised he still can't see they're spiritually blind they still don't know that God they're spiritually blind they still don't know that God don't know his great power and now you notice what he did in the Days of Elijah he can still do today but do we do we believe that I hope we believe that he said God smelt them blind he said you say today he said yes today God can still do the same thing and he said to the same thing about Elijah because they were taken up watch this this is a really powerful quote he said he said they did the same thing when Elijah was taken up and this is this is huge this is this is beyond belief he said because when Elijah was taken up Elisha took his place a young man that went baldheaded now watch this I know you understand this perfectly a young man and the young children came running out to Elisha and said why didn't you go up with Elijah you old bald man you know who those young people were they were the children from the Believers at church he said why didn't you go up baldheaded why didn't you go up with Elijah this is a direct quote this is in spiritual food and due season 65078 in the evening and he said see they didn't even believe it in the beginning the people after so many things that had been done the great man of God had been translated into Heaven by a fire Chariot of fire and the people still didn't believe it and their little children ran out behind the man and said you old Baldi why don't you why don't you go up too he said see and the pr the pro the prophet cursed the people and a Shear bear come out and ate 42 of them he said that was because of the Believers unbelief you said well I believe God have I seen Elijah go up in the Chariot of fire these Believers Never God help us God help me God help me can you imagine physically see Elijah leave in a chariot of fire and be so spiritually stupid to mock God and say well why didn't you go up too Elijah cuz they didn't even believe it really even happened wow God help us God help us here and I I read this scripture before and I'm going to close here just uh Luke 18: 28:30 and Peter said Lo father we've left everything to follow you and he said unto them this is God verily I say unto you that there is no man that's left a house or parents or Brethren or wife or children children for the kingdom of God's sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come everlasting life Amen brother bram's talking about us being nuts for Christ he said it's about time we became nuts radical radical ridiculous peculiar eye-catchers people that stand out for Christ oddballs he said how do I know I'm threaded right because I watch the word of God and you know whether you're threaded right whether you're a nut for Christ or you'll be a nut for The World God help us my last quote and we'll close but there's there is a Christian Amnesia here that's that's a sleeping drug and there's an Opie that comes from the Lily and the Christian church has some Opie and it's from the lily of the valley oh it sues all the pain that's it's and it's all over when when you get to become a Christian you have the Christian Opie the painkiller and it's a new wine the they had on the day of Pentecost and it soes the pain that's came through your life and people there's two paragraphs and we're closing and people are so arrogant that they they're doing things that they ought not do instead of trying to get to the root cause of what's wrong in their life and people are flirting with you know the Bible says if you love the world and the things of the world you're not even converted they're just putting on they're just putting on another case with it and you'll never find the cure until you get rid of the case and man's trying to find something to satisfy and he's thirsty and God made him to thirst and he built a way but God built him in a way that he would thirst after God but he tries to satisfy it he tries to satisfy it and the harsh and whole holy call that's in him by the things of the world and we got no right to do that now but the people do wrong constantly instead of going to the place that you get rid of the cause and try to to uh you try to get rid of it by worldly pleasure when God built it up for worshiping him and all this builds up pressure and it just makes it get worse all the time because you're not going about or you're not looking for the right thing God help us God help us amen whatever you do in secret God will reward you openly amen God help me and God help us to do more for him in secret God's plan for the church and God's plan in the church number one was the reverence of the Lord God in secret and he would reward his people openly God help us that we I pray that we don't want just God as our savior and our healer but we actually want him as the boss the boss and no matter how what decision he makes that we'll follow it because we know it'll be good for us the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord regardless of where they go it's to bring Glory it might not just bring glory to you individually but it'll bring glory to the family of God Amen God help us reverence I just I just love that you know it's a great mystery but that we will reverence God it's our our attitude to God does God disappoint you or do you love them anyway let's stand oh help me Jesus help me Jesus just sing that song worthy or worthy are you Lord amen he's worthy whether we know it or not he's still worthy amen help me Jesus regardless of what happens in your life God's in control just lay it at his door just

I just lay my bills right there I just put them on the desk God it's up you know if you if you're traveling for God it's not up to you to pay the bills that's God's bill to pay amen if God wants our church here there'll be the money will be there if he doesn't it won't be there that's God's plan it's up to him we just get a res that that he's our Lord whatever he chooses is what he wants but
