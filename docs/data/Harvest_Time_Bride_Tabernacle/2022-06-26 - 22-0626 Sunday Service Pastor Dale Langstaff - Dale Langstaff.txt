your beautiful name we pray hallelujah amen thank you lord jesus thank you musicians jared bless you all it's just wonderful to be here we uh love and appreciate every one of you just remember we we say sometimes remember sister kim and sarnia just just has been here a few weeks just just lift her up in prayer for you we've talked to her and just you know she still loves us she'll be listening online and just life sometimes comes in like a flood and then also jim and linda and chatham we also talk to them regularly man and just sister linda's very poorly and also brother john blackman we seen him yesterday he said to greet the church and send you his love and he uh he just can't walk he's just not an old man 69 with basically no legs man just so god would he's not happy just being locked in a room you know it's just kind of life life can be kind of tough amen we just remember our brothers and sisters and our friends in christ amen amen let's just turn to scriptures uh matthew 12 34 we're going to start with and i want to preach on i believe god wants to preach on something this morning what what is in your cup what is in your cup we're going to read to 37 o generation of vipers how can ye be an evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speakest and a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasures bringeth forth evil things you can judge the whole world on those two scriptures but i say unto you that every idle word that's powerful that a man shall speak he shall give an account therefore on the day of judgment i i don't want to be in that spot amen 20 or 37 for by thy words shall doubt be justified and by thy words shalt thou be condemned wow that's powerful so we have a choice galatians 5 13 to 17 galatians 5 13 17 for brethren ye have been called on to liberty not only use not liberty for the occasion to the flesh but to love serve one another now we were preaching that christianity is living for others for the law is fulfilled in one word even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if thou bite and devour one another take heed that you not consume each other for this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh blesses after the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary one to another so that ye cannot do the things that ye would hallelujah you may have your seats and we just ask the lord to bless his word in a special way amen we thank him for that amen you know i want to give you a little uh scenario here before we look into god's word this morning and we're going to look at a bunch of examples in god's word situations people that came into situations the same as we do same as each one of us do in our daily watch amen and so i want you to think of this compare this uh and this will help you i believe with this thought that we want what's in your cup you think of this that you got a cup of coffee and somebody comes by and carelessly bumps into you spilling your coffee everywhere and i want to ask you what spilled your coffee and you would look at me kind of say isn't it kind of obvious somebody carelessly recklessly bumped into you bumped into me and spilled my coffee but i want you to look at that a different way because if you would have had tea in your cup you wouldn't have spilled coffee and if you wouldn't had nothing in your cup nothing would have came out of your cup and life gives us all cups and what you have in your cup when the world comes in on you will depend on what you spill now we're all going to be hit by cares and things of the world and people but what are you going to spill out of your cup are you gonna spill the fruits of the spirit which are love patience meekness goodness longsuffering gentle forgiveness for bearing one another or is you're gonna spill all over you envy hate malice evil speaking you say oh i would never ever even go there on these things we all deal with that every day every day i want to tell you a story to start out with the profit and its questions and answers and i i'm sorry but i just uh i just feel i want to read some of this because it's just so amazing it just is our sermon in a nutshell he said now if the spirit of elijah was on john then it makes john act like elijah and if the spirit of god is upon you you will act like jesus now there's where you find the holy spirit see the holy spirit does it and it makes you meek and makes you humble and it makes you forgiving could they pull the whiskers of your face and if you had them there could they jerk out and spit on your face and would you have the power when could they pull out your whiskers and spit in your face when you had the power to call the legions of an army could you do that for the love of the people that was spitting in your face could you do it if someone could just walk up to you and say you're a hypocrite and smack you on one side of the face could you pray for their forgiveness he said now that's where the test whether you got it or not whether you got the holy spirit or not when someone says evil against someone and sometimes claims to have the holy spirit now watch this when someone says something evil against someone sometimes that claims to have the holy spirit and i'll even with i now even that up with her if it takes me until my last days he said now that's where you check your holy spirit wow you'll get eve uh he said blessed are they that say all manner of evil against you for my sake so so often rejoice in be exceedingly glad for before you so persecuted they the prophets and then someone would say evil to you about you and you would say something good if you can't say something good about them then don't say nothing at all but pray for them and if there's one thing in life that helped me now this is our prophet talking this question is the answer 59 he said if there's one thing in life that helped me understand what the holy spirit was when it came down there to me and that day that i was a hot-headed furious irish on both sides and he said i could go i could hardly eat sorry i was watching that i could hardly eat because my mouth god bless you brother fred i could hardly eat because my mouth was smashed in from fights because i had such a short temper this is our vindicated prophet he said people would jump up he said if people got my fury up he said if they were so big i had to get on a stepladder i would beat the right out of them huh he said i had an old teacher one time she said i was getting in trouble every day just fighting every day people would make fun of me they made fun of my hair they made fun when he moved to indiana because he was from kentucky that made fun of his english and he said i would just two or three boys would be circled me and he said i would beat them and they would beat me he said this teacher came out and she's give me a string she loved brother billy and and she cried over him and she just wanted him to do well she said billy when when that happens again he said take your string out of your pocket and tie knots and tie the knots so everything's under control and so this teacher loved me she cried over the top of me and said these things and so first time out in the playground these boys jumped me i said i pulled that string out and i tried to tie one knot said i dropped that string on the ground and i give them a pounding of course they amen he said one time you know the story when the three boys beat up on them so bad they almost left them for dad he said i went home and he said i got my winchester rifle and he said there was four or five of the boys that beat me so i could hardly stand up and he said i would have shot all four of them see that was in his cup he said i was only about 20 12 then a hot temper and the teacher said he said you take that string and he said when you get mad tie knots he said when you do that it'll bring the string back to me and it'll beat your temper he told her i'll try to do that man of course it never happened he said mr billy talked to himself he said i could never be a christian he said but let me tell you some he said down there in in ohio the ave when the holy spirit came down on me he said it settled the temper matter right there he said that was over see what was in his cup changed it changed he said it was over he said i could never do that he said at the time he said i could never be a christian because i couldn't get over it but he said something that was born in me that made him have that temper but boy my daddy was hot-headed and my mom was half-indian and they would fight like a bug saw those boys would jump me and he's talking about it climbing a ladder but he said now he said now you could drag me out there and wallop me to death he said i wouldn't do a thing he said that's not me doing that he said something happened he said it's an old power the old william branham died and someone else came in and he said now it makes me feel sorry for my enemies and when someone does something wrong against me he said i never pray against them i pray for them and that's where the holy spirit that's where the holy spirit will give you the test the other night he's talking about in england where those people were in the front of the seat and he said i forgive you he said that's the real test of what spirit is anointing you what do we have in our cup if we have good things in our cup when you get bumped into just good things we'll fall out and if you have bad things in your cup bad things and you can be assured that what's in your cup is going to spill god made it that way it will spill guaranteed this bill i want to show you i have another example of where the prophet did but i want to look at some examples in the bible and i know i want to cautious you on this you think well this is past tense and it's hard to read a book when you know how it ended it's hard to read and to finish a book and you know the ending and you think well you know this was this was you know this was this ain't parallel to today but you got to try to place yourself in their position second kings five the beginning of second kings five here we had the captain naham and he was the host of the king of syria and they had one down to israel and they had taken over in an army and taken prisoners captive now i can guarantee you and especially for a young teenage girl it was not a purdy site but wait say oh yeah but wait no the story was sofa but what was in that little girl's cup spilled out and if it had been you just put yourself in that position can you imagine your mom and dad being massacred by another army and them dragging you off to war you're completely their slave they can do whatever you they want to with you you have completely zero say i'm not sure that good things would come out of my cup amen because see we're still in bodies and see what's in her cup can change i'm going to show you somebody and david's got but changed can change daily man but what's in your cup and it affects your environment around you and it affects all the people that you love the most because they're the ones that are getting spilled on they're either getting burnt by good things blessed by good things they're burnt by bad things and here this little maid he says in in verse two he said they were brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maine now you know as soon as an israelite jew leaves their homeland they lose all their blessings now she's she's a prisoner of war a slave i can't trust that's enough can you imagine julie you're kid just a slave gone boom you'll never see him again and they find out that the the dirty rotten person that took him had a sickness and this is what spilled out of her cup in verse 3 she said i would to god my lord were with the prophet that was back in israel because he could recover of his leprosy i'm not so sure if i was in that situation i'd be worrying about my slave master leprosy amen you just picture that here's a little maid and slave leprosy here's joseph in genesis 45 verse one it starts out in joseph when he comes and his brother and came to him now just remember this they had joseph was a perfect type of jesus they had beat joseph they left him for dead they had sold him into slavery i mean they actually planned on killing him it was only their greed for money that they never killed him wasn't a lot of love flowing between that family reunion and joseph the bible says in 45 and verse 1 it says he couldn't refrain before them and he cried so loud that all of egypt heard him wow verse two he wept aloud that the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard him he actually cared for the people that planned on murdering them and then they seemed that they could get through the pieces of silver he had something in his cup it wasn't flesh it wasn't flesh here down in verse 4 he said i am joseph your brother whom you sowed into egypt verse 5 and now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for god did sent me before you to preserve life you know what do we have in our cup what do people around us have in their cup you can see it when it's pushed amazing here's the prophet another story from the prophet and i won't read this so close but you know the story of the prophet when he was going to a nice restaurant during the week it was the mennonites in the restaurant and the prophet says they closed to go to sunday school on sunday and he needed something to eat and he went to the nasty restaurant across the road or the worldly restaurant across the road and he walked in the place and it was a bad scene now now in defense of our prophet you have to understand that he just came from the presence of jehovah and it was going from heavenly things to hell literally and it was really really really bad and the prophet said he said oh god why don't you just wipe this place right off the map he couldn't imagine his daughters growing up in a place like that now that you know there was a young girl there with a bunch of men messing around on a table and there was an older lady there in her 50s that was with the cop and it was just a bad bad bad very vulgar scene they were gambling he said it was illegal to gamble in ohio at that time and see what the prophet had in his cup it spilled out because when he walked in that restaurant he wanted to blow them up and then he said in paragraph 30 he said and they heard the angel of the lord say come aside and i walked over there and he said i got through and he got through with me and i felt like a different person it's what changed in his cup he said what are you condemning her for and he said i saw a vision of the world and he said another world and there was a rainbow around the world it was the blood of christ and it was protecting god's wrath and he couldn't look upon it and he would destroy the thing right then because he said the day that you eat thereof you shall die so god's wrath caused for judgment but it was the blood of christ that was keeping god's judgment from blowing us all off the face of the earth including this restaurant and he said i thought like this and i said i seen myself also though and i didn't do that but i'm a sinner i didn't do what they're doing in the restaurant but i'm a sinner and then the blood of jesus christ acts like a bumper and when my sin went up it hit him in the face and jarred his precious head and i could see the tears and the blood running down i said oh forgive them father christ said oh forgive him father for he didn't know what he was doing and i would do something else and it would hit him like that again this is the prophet from the sins and jesus would say to the father forgive him father the prophet don't know what he's doing billy don't know what he's meaning the prophet and he said i see my old book laying there a sinner and everything on it and i seen my sins that i was doing it and i said lord will you forgive me and he took my hand to one side and got some got got some blood out and rode across the top pardon and threw it back in the sea of forgiveness and to remember it no more and it was gone forever and he said i forgave you but you're for condemning them or her and it changed my whole idea and i said lord have mercy he went over to the lady and you know the story of the lady said that she had someone and she was thinking completely carnal and the prophet said no i don't mean in that way and she had been an old sunday schools teacher she had children at home and life had come in and backslitter drove her to the bar and he said you know what he said the woman wiped out slipped out of the seat the restaurant he said we had a prayer meeting there like you've heard never heard in your life because she come to christ and what was it don't condemn them don't tell them the gospel don't condemn them tell them the gospel he said they're demon possessed and they're immortals in this realm and they've been influenced over here but your influence comes above theirs he said let's see what we can do with our talents and win others to christ see how god had to come to our prophet and change his cup in a vision god help us it's not because somebody bumps into you the bad things come out of your cup it's because you already have the bad things in there and it's just manifesting what's coming out by your action to a reaction showing what you really are and not only are you showing other people around you but god's actually doing that to show ourselves a reaction to an action now i don't know if you're really getting this i want to i want to maybe give you another bible one then i want to talk about david here's an example where they came to get jesus out of the garden now jesus was god and he was flesh too he was 100 the fullness of the godhead bodily but he was 100 percent felt the affirmatives of us he felt what it was like when they put the thorns on his head he knew what pain was he felt what it was like to be rejected he felt what it was like to be spit on and gambled and smacked and said tell us who who hit you he knew what that felt like because he had to feel that to feel what we feel man and here he goes done nothing wrong an innocent man an innocent man and peter out of the love of the flesh pulled his sword to defend him and cut off one of the high priesters now they're there to take jesus to nail them to a cross and jesus knows it and in luke 22 and 51 jesus answered and said suffer these things of fire and he touched the high priest's ear and he healed his ear and they immediately led him away for judgment pretty obvious to see what was in his cup he knew that those same people were going to condemn him to death he didn't have to touch the year it wasn't him that did the year he hadn't given the order to do the year he was completely unhappy that it happened see how christianity is living for others and it shows it by what's in your cup god help us you know god help us in our daily lives let me let me give you a daily thing and we're going to look at david and david's cop changed there's three different scriptures on david's cup you know we were heading to church this morning and we're going to go celebrate our anniversary tomorrow and that and we were part way to church i had to pass sister patty on the way and then i felt real guilty we got stopped at a red light together and god was judging me for passage or something and i said honey did you bring the money and she said well no i said well what are we going to buy gas with well i have she told me and i said but you're going away for five days but you see now i knew what i was preaching this morning or i was oh what would have been in my cup what a show how could you go on a holiday without money i made that really personal that happened an hour ago but that probably happened to you an hour ago too you don't have to tell me but it showed the people closest to you what was in your cup huh every idle word you answer for meanness or patience meekness longsuffering see we just think we can just you can't just let her fly amen it shows what's in our cup i mean what we're we're saying one thing but when we get bumped our life spills and everybody gets burned amen here's an example in first samuel 24 here's david and saul he's running for his life and god makes a way to see what's in david's cup and uh god brings saul to him and david's men come right up to david's men said unto him in in verse 4 samuel 24 and 4. he's the name of man said unto behold the day of the lord the day which the lord said unto thee behold i deliver thy enemies into thy hand thou mayest doeth with him and shall seem good unto thee and david arose and cut off a piece of saul's robe they wanted him to take his life when saul was back in the cave and this shows you what was in david's cup and it came to pass afterwards verse 5 came to pass afterwards said david's heart smote him because he had killed saul that's what we would have done that's what i would have felt like doing i mean it's either me or you right i don't know how those people that are christians in the state they fed people tell me you know i got enough ammunition to hold off the town david came to pass afterwards david tart smote him because he had touched saw his garment that's all cut his garment i imagine if he had a it looked like god had done it for a purpose saul had three thousand men david had a few just close-knit friends they weren't even jews most of them for sure here's another example what with david in his cup in samuel first samuel 26 and verse 5 and david arose and came to the place where saul was pitched and david beheld the place where saul laid and the men with them the captain of the hosts or men that were with saw and they laid entrenched and the people were pitched around about him now saul was out if you read these scriptures in both cases he had 3 000 of his best military men with them 3 000 to get one man like they probably had enough and david asked this man he said who will go down with me into the camp of saul and one of his men said i'll go down with you and david said unto him to the people that by night behold saw laid sleeping in the trench and his spear was stuck in the ground at his poster and the people laid about them in verse 8 and david's man said hath god not delivered thine enemy into thy hands this day now remember remember david's man was not out of the way david was anointed by god's prophet to be the king at that very time because the bible says previous that the spirit of god had left saul we could learn a lot by this date god's delivered that enemy into the hand to make them like the bible would say make them your footstool and now therefore let me slay him i pray thee with his spear that's in the earth once and i will only smote him one time i won't hit him twice it'll just take one spear through his heart we won't mangle him we won't torture him and david said unto his men destroy him not for whom can stretch forth his hand against god's anointed and be guiltless and actually it was a stretch to say he was god's anointed but here i want to show you in second samuel 12 where david's cop changed now david had a really good stuff in his cup and that's where with us in our life we can have really good stuff in our cup but sometimes the satan will come in like a flood and the holy spirit's there oh yeah he's there if you accept him but sometimes like paul said he said i fall down daily sometimes something catches you just off and you say something that when you went to bed at night you wished you hadn't said amen second samuel 12 in the beginning of one and the lord sent nathan to david and he came on to him and said unto him therefore there was two men in one city one was rich and one was poor and the rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing save one yo lamb which he brought and nourished it up and grew it up together with him and his children and they did eat his own meat and drank his own cup and they laid in his bosom and was with him as a daughter the little lamb was as a daughter to the man and there came a traveler on to the rich man and he spared to take his own flock and his own herds and he dressed the fair and to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but he took the poor man's lamb and he dressed that man's lamb that was come unto him and david's anger was immediately kindled against a man and he said unto the prophet he said as a lord god liveth that man that done this thing so surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he hath no pity and nahim the prophet said unto david doubt art that man verse 9 he said therefore thou has despised the commandments of the lord to do evil in his sight and thou has killed uriah the hittite here a lot of david's inner circle men when saul was killed were not even jews but they seen the power of god in the anointing of god on david and they knew he would be kin here's a hittite giving his life for the jewish people a hittite with his sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of ammon see david's cop changed and so can our cup change that's why we always need to be on guard amen who's in our cup here here's another example and just show you like the things and i want to i got a kind of a climax to finish here here's the story of paul and silas and you knew this story now paul was not uh the the same lineage as like he was not able to be beaten jewish background and that men like paul and silas prayed they'd been through into prisoner but it was actually illegal for paul to not have a trial and uh they sang songs and were praising god for for uh well they were just continuing on as if nothing had changed and suddenly there was a great earthquake and the prisons were shaken and immediately the doors of the prison opened and the their bands were loose now listen number one paul and silas hadn't done nothing wrong to be in prison number two the people that had threw him in there had actually broke their own laws because paul had the right to a trial and the pre-loop and all that he actually brought them because they actually feared when they realized who paul was man and they agreed to let paul go the fear and he paul made him come right to him i don't think we would have been worried about the person that was in charge of putting us in there you know like if something happened to somebody like big in our you know we'd say we're surprised it took that long you know and the keeper of the prison awake from his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew his own sword and would have killed himself and we would have said hooray can i help you but paul had something else in his cup this prisoner or the jailer had supposing the prisoner left him but paul cried with a loud voice wait we're all here what have i done that would have you done that you can answer that question by what's in your cup but because of what was in paul's cup he was able to lead the jailer and his whole family to eternal life wow wow god help us amen here's another example in exodus one here the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives and he told the midwives he said when the hebrew women come to have their children if it's a son kill them if it's a daughter let it live but the midwives they were pagan they had no lineage like they didn't go to church on sunday they didn't profess the message of the hour no no they were flat out working for the government but they feared god man they had something even in that state they had something else in their cup how much more should a holy ghost-filled child of god have something different in his cup and they lied to their own king and they said the hebrew women are super women and when they come to that state they are so powerful they've already birthed before we arrived but believers what would have we had done that depends what's in your cup let me give you a little scenario this is and then i was going to read a scripture here at the end who killed abel his brother who sold joseph his brothers who expelled jehoshaphat ex expelled i think i'm saying that right his brothers who was jealous of david his brothers who was unhappy from the prodigal son returned his brother i want to finish reading this now among so many examples in the bible we perceive that all those who have been betrayed and mistreated by their own brethren have been mainly have been greatly blessed and kept by god wow they had something in their cup in life people may consider your family and may turn their backs on you they may their rejection may be a path to god's plan for your glory only never hold a grudge against them pray instead for them and wish them well and blessings even if your own family don't believe in you almighty god himself has chosen you and will give you what you need to fulfill his plan may god lead you where you will and consider and be honored to be a part of god's family wow let's go to second peter one we can close with this what's in your cup well it seemed fairly obvious somebody carelessly bumped into me but if you wouldn't have had nothing in it or only blessings in it those other things would not have spilled out it wasn't the person's fault that carelessly bumped into you it was god revealing to the world and mainfully yourself what was in your cup now you think of all the people in your own life we we should judge ourselves first but then people that have been in your life cycle and see what's you can see by what spills in the cup see the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered of the lord but a righteous man still spills his cup because god it has to be that way because that's how god's salvation happens how's the gospel spill it's because it's good things in the cup how's the world know that he's a savior by what spills out of your cup how's the world know kindness by what spills out of your cup how's the world ever see patience or honor or reverence because what spills out of your cup so it's just it's like the bible in genesis where where it's a law that the seed will bring forth of its own kind we talked about that a couple weeks ago and jesus was our wave sheaf offering and brought a family after him but so here here was a seed of the kind of jesus and he was our example he was our lord he was our savior but so will this be with our cup the same law applies a seed will bring forth of its kind and so if you got the wrong kind of seed in your cup it'll spill because it is going to spill you don't have to worry about it spilling that's called life life the destination of life is spilling your cup and that was god's whole plan to redeem a lost world let your light so shine before men that they shall see your good works and glorify your father these are worldly people which is in heaven this ain't a mistake god knew exactly what he was doing god planned on you hitting a road bump and spilling your coffee so the world would see and glorify him he planned on people listen to this church he planned on people mistreating you robbing and saying lies about you he planned on that so your cup would spill kindness and the world would see and glorify him that's powerful so what's in your cup if it's positivist is all for the glory of god or the glory of satan depending on what seed brings forth of its kind god help me god help me ii peter 1 and starting at verse 5 and besides this giving all diligence to your face virtue and virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness charity which if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren or unfruitful see god gets the glory maybe not even directly from you but by the people that seen you they give glory to god wow there goes a gentleman wow there goes a real lady wow they were and they give and when they go wild they're giving god glory or they go ouch that you be not barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sense wow god help us i want to close with just a little story maybe this will be for the kids you know it's all in how you see your actions your or your your that what happens to you it's all in how you react to what happened reaction to an action is life there was a story told about two boys and it was they went out to the barn and they had been praying for a pony and the one boy the boys had different things in their cup and they went out to the barn but they didn't see a pony they thought their dad had pulled the fast one on them and not got him a pony and the one boy seen some waste and he said oh boys we got garbage to clean out of the barn and the other boy started jumping up and down he said oh boy where there's garbage there's horses where there's manure there's horses that's that god help us what's in our cup it happens every day to us we get the opportunity to show and and i know because i'm human i know what happens in every one of your days just any little thing it might be it might be a little spill it's like oh i almost lost it some days it's a whole baked splash but how you go back through the drive-through and say oh this coffee burnt me yesterday fried me and i want a triple cup and you drive away do they glorify your god which was in heaven wow was all god's plan to save a world and he would get the glory by what spills out of our cup if nothing ever spilled out of our cup the world would be lost if these good things hadn't spilled out of jesus christ we all would have been lost but she was our great sacrifice hallelujah that's just amazing thank you lord thank you lord jesus give me something honey hallelujah thank you lord jesus amen more than ever before lord i love you [Music] when i left they've been watching for years i told them how we enjoyed being next to the church and he said something that made me think he said it's amazing our life circle keeps bringing us around 20 years ago back around 20 years later watch christ could care less if they ever remember who or what about me for us but just christ we could just see christ let's sing this one more times [Music] lord i need you more than ever [Music] [Laughter] oh lord jesus we thank you for your word today lord jesus i pray lord jesus for myself and us lord jesus that you would help us look at what's in our cup lord jesus i desire to have only you and my cup i desire to have the attributes of you everything that would come out of your beautiful holy spirit in my cup lord jesus the lord as we go through our life and we get bumped and our cup spills out that it would splash jesus it would splash kindness and patience and love and all these beautiful things salvation and long-suffering and mercy and grace to a world that's going to hell without your salvation lord jesus help us to let our light shine that the world will see but for sure our closest friends and family will see that there's something in our cup and when it spilled it didn't burn us it spilled all over us but it didn't burn us it was really peculiar it was almost a paradox i got soaking wet but it was supposed to be hot but it didn't burn because it was you christ hallelujah blessed be your beautiful name for all of eternity bless your beautiful bride here today lord jesus thank you for our friends thank you for our family and our friends may our light so shine that the world testify and give glory to you lord jesus you sure deserve the glory and the honor and praise the magnificent lord
