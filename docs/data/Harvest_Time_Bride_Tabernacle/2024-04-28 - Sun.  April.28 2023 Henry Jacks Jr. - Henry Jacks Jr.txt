love I just love what I'm seeing every every year I come there's the changes happening different different changes that's amazing oh praise God I just love it you know I just love when people is doing something for the Lord you know yeah I just love it praise the Lord St John chapter 6 praise the Lord we're going to read a few verses we're going to look at um verse 61- 63 when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmur at it he said unto them don't this offend you right what he knew was what he said back here in verse 54 whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood at eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my verse 55 for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him these are very strong statement Hallelujah verse 57 as the living father had sent me and I live by the father so he he that eateth me even He Shall Live By Me Oh God we are called to eat Christ amen we're called to heit him praise God verse 58 this is that bread which came down from heaven if you go back further in the in the same chapter they were talking about man right yes you know Moses our fathers eat Mana in the wilderness and Jesus said though they eat Mana they are dead Hallelujah so he was shifting their focus shifting their mind from the Mana to himself I am the living bre but he was not speaking to them in our literal way but they misunderstood that and they thought that he was speaking literal but it was spiritual Hallelujah because everything that Jesus said he was speaking in a spiritual sense but in order to it the Bible said in 1 Corinthians 2:14 the natural man cannot understand the things of God it is foolishness unto him Hallelujah because it is spiritually designed amen hallelujah he said as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread Hallelujah shall live forever hallelujah hallelujah praise God so because he said these things it offended them I tell you there's something about the truth the truth can cause offend and the truth can liberate hallelujah praise God the truth liberate us hallelujah that's why we sing the song I am free I'm no longer bound no more trains holding me Hallelujah praise God go back to verse 60 63 now verse 62 what and if you shall see the son of man asign up where he was before it is the spirit that Quicken it Hallelujah can I repeat that can I endorse on that it is a spirit that Quicken it not the word that's right not the letter now the letter cannot Quicken it that's right it takes a spirit to Quicken the letter amen because the letter kill it but the spirit give life glory to God hallelujah he said and the flesh profit nothing that's right though Jesus understood that they that they thought it was literal he was saying you see this flesh it profit nothing without the spirit in this flesh it profit nothing amen hallelujah oh glory to God that's why it is important to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] Hallelujah it is important to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give you Revelation hallelujah oh you can be seated Hallelujah I just get excited I'm sorry to keep you standing so long I'm just excited about the word hallelujah glory to God remember in St John 1 the Bible said the word was made flesh amen hallelujah and dwelt Among Us amen and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of the father amen he said heing was full of grace and truth yes sir Hallelujah so without the Holy Ghost we know the Holy Ghost Inside of us though the word is the seed of God and once the word is been so in that heart amen which is the good ground yes it takes the spirit to Quicken that word so that it become alive amen hallelujah so that it become accelerated yes you know when you're driving a a a a motor vehicle and you put your foot and the gas it accelerate so we it with the Holy Ghost you accelerate in the Rapture you accelerate in the body of Christ you accelerate in the resurrection Hallelujah you accelerated in Grace you accelerated in Mercy amen hallelujah oh praise the god the word Quicken Hallelujah it means glory to God hallelujah it means to make alive right glory to God you see that it means to give life that word Quicken the Greek word it is pronounced zo Z which means to give life that's the difference between the quickening spirit and the living Soul the Bible said in 1 Corinthians 5 verse 47 and Adam was made a living Soul yes sir but Jesus was made a quickening spirit sir there's a difference there the quickening spirit gives life yes sir to the spirit amen amen Adam couldn't give life to the spirit yes sir because he was made of a living soul but Adam could give life to the flesh that's why Jesus tell Nicodemus he that is born of the flesh is of the flesh but he that is born of the spirit is of the spirit amen hallelujah praise God glory to God hallelujah amen do you love him this morning yes sir praise God when Jesus speak these things in St John 6 he was in in Galilee and Nazareth is in Galilee that was about Galilee was about 80 to 85 miles away from Jerusalem right yeah remember Jerusalem was of the kingdom of the South Hallelujah Judah there was two Kingdom in that time when Jesus came the kingdom was splitted in two you have the kingdom of Judah that was in the South yeah and the Kingdom of Israel that was in the north amen Jesus was born in Bethany which was in Jerusalem Hallelujah but he grow up in Nazareth that's why they call him Jesus of Nazareth that's right and the disciples came from galileans that's why act to ear these men of um galileon and know they speak in our own language Hallelujah so these disciples they came from galileans is it not right according to Acts chapter 2 but here hallelujah in St John 5 Jesus was in Jerusalem Hallelujah but then in St John 6 he left Jerusalem and went back to Galilee to the Sea of tiberious Hallelujah and here he was speaking about Hallelujah the the bread of life right when you read St John 6 the Bible said they came to him and he turned to his disciples what we have can feed these persons he said it just to prove them God can say things to you just to prove you right amen because he want to test you that's right do you know that God can give you a s yeah just to see what you would do with that stick right Hallelujah that's how he works right he gave the prophet Moses a stick right he said Moses whatever you do you just stretch those stick right but then Moses relied so much upon the staff when it was time for him to move away from the staff God said to Moses speak to the rock that water make come for it God can bring you to a level where he allow you to use this piece of paper and then in his appointed time he's ready to shift you away from the paper right and God was doing that to Moses Israel and Moses R so much on the stick Hallelujah when Israel saw Moses Tres the stick they knew that Miracle is going to happen Hallelujah and God said to Moses speak to the rock hallelujah speak to the Rock now today people rely so much on the tapes right Hallelujah they rely so much on the tapes Hallelujah glory to God but God is moving us hallelujah the voice that is under tape must be in our heart Hallelujah glory to God he must be in our show it must accept at us it must revive us it must Quicken us sir bring us to life we are The Voice Hallelujah I see today that people when they need healing brother Dale they will just play the tape to receive healing Hallelujah I got news for you healing must be in you not on the tank Hallelujah it must be in you the prophet said whatever you got needed for in this life yes sir there you go in this life he's already in you don't you think that God know that you're going to meet certain condition that you're going to need healing amen he has to place that in you because healing is a sign that you have a Immortal body with Hallelujah so that is in you he said Moses why cry speak and go forward why you cry when healing in you you got to speak it you got to step into that promise but it takes the spirit of God to Quicken that word that becomes alive and said I have received healing right Hallelujah I'm going to step in my healing there you go glory to God hallelujah beautiful Hallelujah do you love him yes sir amen amen I tell you s we live in a glorious age yes Hallelujah God is doing something in this age and God is doing it to the body of Christ Hallelujah glory to God here when Jesus buil a conversation he said gather all the mens into group and he gathered them the Bible said there were about 5,000 men right did you know that that God when you know God did you know that God don't waste anything brother God doesn't waste anything the Bible said after he feed the 5,000 men children and woman and those and and and the fragman that was leave he said to his disciple pick up everything pick up everything God doesn't waste thing he doesn't waste it he said pick it up yes sir and today we're such some Christians like to waste things oh the Lord will provide tomorrow so you know what you can waste it today because the Lord is going to provide tomorrow wow it doesn't work that way it doesn't work that way am God doesn't waste thing yes he said let tomorrow provide for itself but he never tell you oh because I'm going to provide for tomorrow you can waste it no that's not the God we serve God doesn't waste he said pick up the fragments amen amen pick it up everything everything that left you pick it up do not lose nothing yeah read the Bible that's what it said in the Bible he said do not lose nothing that's the God we serve here we talk about the Rapture what is the rapture Hallelujah the Rapture is a Ministry yeah yes sir it's a Ministry yeah we thought yes the prophet said the Rapture is not going he said the Rapture is in progress right it is in progress Hallelujah some person believe that the Rapture already gone some believe that the Rapture is not happening now yeah but when you understand the Bible right when you understand the shout the voice and the Trump of God then you understand that the Rapture is a Ministry and is happening right now amen because it's a Ministry the prophet speak about the seven Thunders he said you know what the seven Thunders was it give you rapturing Faith amen if the prophet said that give you rapturing faith we are to be manifesting rupturing Faith now but it's a progress he said when you see Christ become visible among you Jesus Christ am I preaching he must be visible among you when I look at brother Dale I must see Christ when I look at brother Geron I must see Christ when I look at my brother car I must see Christ he must be visible Among Us Hallelujah sir oh praise God and when Christ is visible among us we see signs and wonders hallelujah hallelujah we see signs and wonders I tell you saints of God no matter the condition your very present can heal somebody beside you Hallelujah your very presence can heal somebody beside you you know that's why it is important come to Fellowship amen amen hallelujah because God want to even use the very [Applause] Shadow Hallelujah not your mouth not your hands not your feet but your very Shadow Hallelujah the Bible said Peter even when they laid H all the sick person he pass over them and his very Shadow healer sick sometime God doesn't want to use our mouth he doesn't want to use our hands but even though our very Shadow can heal the sick thank you Lord but you know what you got to get in harmony with the [Music] father once you get in that Harmony God can Hallelujah the power of God will manifest amen the Bible said Peter the devil is after you to see you to see you like wheat that's right Jesus Hallelujah do you know that God never call us to fight one another no God never call us to fight the ministry no no God never call us hallelujah to say oh that church is not do not preaching the right thing or that church is not preaching the right thing no you know what God call us to do love love love strengthen he said Peter when you are converted strengthen your Breen yes sir and I think that's what the most emphasis must place on is conversion yes sir because when you converted you know what is your purpose you know that your purpose is to strengthen one another you're here to strengthen me and I'm here to strengthen you Hallelujah and we must work together as one Jesus Hallelujah glory to God God doesn't work without his body God always work with his body Hallelujah when he came he said foxes of whole birds of Nest but the son of man has no where to lay his head Hallelujah glory to God one time they turn to him said there is your mother there is your brother Hallelujah here they were referring to in the natural but Jesus said who is my mother and who is my brother but they that do the will of my father they are my mother there my brothers Hallelujah yes sir it's about the body of Christ yes sir because that's what God is using today Hallelujah to reveal himself to reconcile the world back unto himself is using the body of Christ and we are the members of his body amen hallelujah oh glory to God we are members of that body yes sir by one Spirit we're all baptized into the body of Christ yes sir thank you Jesus hallelujah praise God it takes the spirit of God to even Quicken our own language yes sir Hallelujah without the spirit to Quicken that language Hallelujah people cannot even understand the things of the spirit that's right when Jesus was speaking to Nicodemus who was a teacher yes sir he was a Pharisee a master of Israel yes sir Jesus was speaking things that he didn't even understood amen Jesus said how can you be a ruler how can you be a master and you don't know these things he said I can't even tell you Heavenly things amen you know what because he wouldn't even understand Heavenly things because it's a different language yes right you go when the Bible said in Mark 16 verse 16 he that believeth and is baptized these sign shall follow them that believe sir they shall speak with new tongues that word new tongues means language it means Revelation Hallelujah so it takes the spirit of God to Quicken even the very language that we speak hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God and when that language is quickened we understood amen hallelujah thank you Jesus glory to God it takes a spirit of Quicken us into the body of Christ right to manifest the Rapture the ministry of the Rapture amen am the prophet said Enoch at this testimony that's right that he pleases God hallelujah without faith it is impossible to please God the prophet said what is Faith he said faith is a revelation hey amen it's a revelation Hallelujah it takes a revelation glory to God to put you into that position yes that you can have the confidence and when you have the confidence you are going to express amen you're going to manifest yes Hallelujah and here glory to God Enoch when he was 300 the Bible said 365 years God took him and he was not found the Bible said he walk with God the word walk there that statement walk was mentioned two times in the Bible amen hallelujah amen Enoch walked with God right Hal two times it was mentioned Hallelujah the prophet said that walk means Hallelujah glory to God he said that walk Hallelujah it means a divine revelation it means Oh Glory to God it has to takes God hallelujah yes sir to bring us into that level amen that we can understand Hallelujah the things of God yes sir glory to God Enoch knew when he was going to leave Hallelujah Enoch knew when he was going to leave yes sir but he never tell his family but it wasn't for them you know what it was for you praise the Lord everything that was written in the Scripture it was for your good it was for your translation it is for your salvation it is for your Redemption yes sir Enoch was an example and God placed it there so that you it's for you to understand it glory to God God God saw us in this age that when we come through a natural birth glory to God hallelujah when we bypass our Tony Hallelujah God knew that we're going to be here in this age you know what and he sent back the spirit so that he can Quicken your life to this age Hallelujah the prophet said God has quickened your life to this age sir it's no coincidence while you here it's not a coincidence it was God who quickened your life to this age am you know what God said I want to see brother Dale in this age I want to see sister Sharon in this age H I want to see you in this age because you know what you're going to manifest me amen hallelu oh Hallelujah so even when the devil line up some some Harrows at you and start to shooting hallelujah oh God when all the weapons start to form against you you know what your life is Quicken to this age that's right amen it is already Quicken amen so though the the weapons has been forming and the weapons Hallelujah and the dev is shooting his Harrow glory to God he's just bouncing off because there is an imp penetrated Shield The Shield of faith God has placed that armor upon you so every time when the devil attack you it cannot hurt you he cannot stop you Hallelujah because he has quickened your life to this sh that you are the resurrection you are the life you are the truth you are the way and you are the mercy you are the Redemptive product of God and God has called you to express himself in this age and time so nothing that form against you shall prosper because it is God's doing and the life of God is upon you and His Hands is up you the Bible said Ezekiel said the hand of God was upon me and the hand of God brought me into the desert Hallelujah you know why sometime the hand of God can bring in some situation brother day Hallelujah God this way Saints some situation that we go through yes we describe it as h we describe it as hell Hallelujah but the beauty about it God is there amen David said if I lay my bed in hell is there if I go to the uttermost part of the earth is there amen you know what sometime God will allow us to go to hell you
