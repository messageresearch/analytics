[11:37] say a few
[11:39] things in connection with the song I'm
[11:41] going to
[11:42] sing um the title of the song is called
[11:45] He Didn't Throw the Clay

[11:57] Christ were so
[12:00] broken and
[12:03] fragmented and um we we look like
[12:11] this uh we have rough edges and sharp
[12:17] edges
[12:19] uh and there's no use real use for
[12:23] this um but we have
[12:26] someone who can take this and turn it
[12:30] into

[12:41] home I did for one
[12:44] year I didn't know
[12:46] why I've had this in my drawer for a
[12:48] whole year and then at 3 o'clock this
[12:50] morning the Lord told me to pick these

[12:56] up and now I I know why I had this it's
[13:02] been of no use to me you been occupying
[13:06] pre of space in my
[13:08] drawer uh but when we're like this
[13:12] someone can take us and make us into

[37:38] could not have happened any other time
[37:41] it's phenomenal how God work I want to
[37:45] speak on the thought this morning what's
[37:47] on your
[37:48] mind I
[37:50] heard the Saints group maybe a choir
[37:54] something singing leaving is on my mind
[37:57] oh I just cried oh
[38:00] God
[38:02] hallelujah before you take your seat I
[38:04] just want to say I appreciate brother
[38:06] Dale and his wife and the family he just
[38:09] he has such a Lov the family and you
[38:12] know uh he he is a pastor
[38:16] indeed wonderful pastor and I'm not just
[38:20] saying that because I want to come back
[38:23] no I I I wash spirit and I try to be
[38:26] very observant where I go not all
[38:30] preachers are pastors right pastoring is
[38:34] a
[38:35] gift the Bible speaks of five they are
[38:38] not positions they are
[38:40] gifts you know there were different
[38:42] anointings the Lord commanded the Ravens
[38:45] to feed
[38:46] Elijah but he commanded the widow woman
[38:49] to sustain him so there's a big
[38:52] difference in feeding and
[38:54] sustaining and the spirit of sustainance
[38:57] is on brother
[38:59] Dale not just a feeding the Ravens fed
[39:03] and left that's the woman
[39:07] sustained some of us preachers we feed
[39:10] and leave but the pastor

[44:59] not I'm not going to I'm not taking back
[45:01] anything that I
[45:04] brought I got to leave everything here
[45:07] that I came with is that right it's not
[45:10] fair you know if I come here to Canada
[45:13] for the first time I got to leave
[45:15] everything that I came with so you make
[45:18] sure you you you're here Wednesday night
[45:21] we just have a good time and I I really
[45:23] love all the Holy Spirit just bringing
[45:25] us from Friday you know the current is
[45:28] good and pulling us you know so if we go
[45:31] back and pick some things from Friday
[45:33] last night amen we just just just leave
[45:36] ourselves open you get what you come for
[45:41] you know what you expect but it's all
[45:43] about the mind let's just read you know
[45:46] the writer said in Proverbs
[45:48] 23:8 eat thou not the bread of him that
[45:52] had and Heil High neither desire thou is
[45:56] D toates for as he thinketh in his heart
[46:00] so is he heat and drink said he to the
[46:06] but his heart is not with the God bless
[46:10] you be
[46:11] seated I I actually read that because I
[46:14] read some quotes of the prophet of God
[46:16] he said concerning this but he just
[46:18] state from it what a man thinketh in his
[46:21] heart so is he you know so you say you
[46:25] becoming what you're
[46:28] thinking certainly you're becoming what
[46:30] you're
[46:31] thinking you know and and and so what
[46:34] jumped out of this thought in me is that
[46:36] you know the the the is that what are
[46:38] you thinking
[46:40] now people say I'm thinking about God
[46:44] even a man in a rum bar thinking about
[46:47] God you know that the whole world seems
[46:51] to be so
[46:52] religious every you know they think
[46:54] about God and try not to call the name
[46:57] Jesus though but they're thinking about
[47:00] God you know everybody love God but they
[47:04] hate the name of Jesus that's
[47:07] interesting a religious world that we're
[47:09] living into and you know but when you
[47:12] think about it and you know the proverb
[47:15] says that as you think in your heart so
[47:19] you are is that
[47:22] right so we could talk today and you
[47:25] know know you remember in the Book of
[47:27] Genesis chapter 2:5 if you notice how I
[47:30] preach I like to give a lot of
[47:31] scriptures because what we preach are
[47:33] like to prove it from this is that right
[47:36] SS of God the prophet brought you he
[47:39] said go back to this go back to the word
[47:42] this is absolute amen praise be to God
[47:46] Amen and so you know here in uh in in
[47:50] Genesis chapter
[47:51] 65 amen we saw where the right amen
[47:55] Moses said the imagination of the
[47:59] thoughts of man's heart
[48:02] was evil
[48:06] continually evil in his mind in his
[48:09] thinking was constantly evil and so man
[48:15] becomes evil every day is that right but
[48:19] then let us look at a foundation here
[48:22] and you know in Hades four think and
[48:28] brother Paul the Apostle Paul was in
[48:30] prison when he wrote the letter to the
[48:35] Saints in
[48:36] Ephesus it was one letter with six pages
[48:40] but we call it six
[48:42] chapters but six pages all right but
[48:46] then when you understand that you know
[48:49] think about this as
[48:51] he while he wrote this letter but when
[48:54] you reach a uh history shows that he
[48:58] sailed to
[48:59] militus when he called the Elders of the
[49:03] church in Ephesus because he wasn't able
[49:06] to go back they were trying to persuade
[49:09] him not to go to
[49:11] Jerusalem because the the the the Saints
[49:14] knew that there was a threat on his life
[49:17] in
[49:18] Jerusalem especially from the Jews and
[49:21] so he knew but he really wanted to be at
[49:25] the pass over because Paul was a Jew
[49:28] from The Tribe of Benjamin is that right
[49:31] yet he had dual citizenship with Rome
[49:34] and so he was really uh Bening going to
[49:38] Jerusalem because he want to be at the
[49:40] Passover but they were trying to
[49:43] persuade him not to go but anyway he
[49:45] went he he he s to Milius and you know
[49:49] really wanted to to to speak to the
[49:52] Saints in Ephesus because if you notice
[49:55] how he addressed the Saints in Ephesus
[49:58] Saints in
[50:00] Christ unto the Saints in Christ and or
[50:04] we or we talk to them was a little
[50:07] different how we spoke to those in
[50:10] Corinth and even Rome because the Saints
[50:13] in Ephesus they were more mature when it
[50:16] comes to the word of God you understand
[50:19] that different country different Spirits
[50:22] different regions different spirits and
[50:25] so you know when he called them and he
[50:27] called the elders and you know he told
[50:30] them uh amen I will not see you face to
[50:33] face anymore you know and oh he spoke to
[50:36] them Bible said they were crying and
[50:39] they they kissed him on the neck and
[50:42] embrac him because he told them this is
[50:45] the last I'm going to sing you because
[50:47] he knew that his time was
[50:50] close glory to God hallelujah he knew he
[50:55] upon you knew that he fought a good
[50:57] fight he knew that he kept the faith he
[51:00] said I know I'm going to leave you and I
[51:03] will not see you again but bring this
[51:06] letter home and read it to the
[51:09] regions glory to God and so in page four
[51:14] of the letter we realize oh we all
[51:18] outline the five gifts oh God Amen that
[51:22] God sent to perfect the
[51:26] Saints which was a fivefold
[51:29] Ministry on this is for the perfecting
[51:32] of the Saints for the work of the
[51:36] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[51:39] Christ until we all come into the unity
[51:44] of the faith and now am just laying the
[51:47] foundation here Saints then in the next
[51:50] page P page five he would show them how
[51:55] now when he admonished them and the in
[51:58] the verses 15 and 16 when he said walk
[52:03] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[52:08] Redeeming the time because the days are
[52:15] evil the days are evil glory to God not
[52:19] as fools but as
[52:23] wise then he went down f
[52:26] as he chares the husbands how to treat
[52:29] their
[52:31] wives
[52:32] Hallelujah and he spoke about amen the
[52:36] connection that brought a man to his
[52:40] wife he leave his father and his mother
[52:44] and cleave to his wife it reminded me
[52:48] when the word says Brothers your prayers
[52:52] can be endered the way you treat your
[52:59] wives we having
[53:01] church we having service is that right
[53:05] your prayers can be endered the way you
[53:08] treat your wife we saw about a Paul late
[53:12] out right there when he said Brothers
[53:16] amen you cannot hate your wife because
[53:19] if you hate your wife you are hating
[53:21] your own
[53:22] flesh oh he made it out there amen upon
[53:27] the verge of his departure but not
[53:30] theless he went brought it further he
[53:33] said I'm showing you a
[53:36] mystery I'm showing you a mystery it's
[53:40] your husband and wife but I'm actually
[53:42] showing you a mystery between Christ and
[53:46] the
[53:47] church Hallelujah the church is his wife
[53:51] is that right amen what a mystery oh
[53:55] when the page was read to the church in
[53:59] Ephesus it was told that when the
[54:02] letters reach Ephesus it would have gone
[54:05] on to galatia leysia sardes and all
[54:11] tesalonica amen that everybody want to
[54:14] hear amen that letter right from the
[54:16] Apostle
[54:18] Paul when the part about the husband and
[54:22] wife was read and oh Paul showed you
[54:26] that Christ is going to wash his
[54:29] bride with the washing of the Water by
[54:32] the word oh Christ loved the church and
[54:36] he gave himself for her all the hearts
[54:40] of the people
[54:41] Rejoice like you're rejoicing today to
[54:46] remember that Christ loves you he cares
[54:50] for you he knows what you're going
[54:53] through oh oh my and there is no power
[54:58] in hell that can stop you from going
[55:04] [Applause]
[55:05] home you came from God and there is no
[55:10] doubt you're going back where you came
[55:16] from
[55:18] oh when that page was
[55:21] read it brought to
[55:23] rejoicing it brought a great shout among
[55:28] the
[55:29] Believers Hallelujah that's page
[55:32] five but then God of a way of doing
[55:36] things to shift our
[55:39] minds because he want us to be thinking
[55:43] otherwise
[55:44] Hallelujah the one that turned the next
[55:48] page Paul shift from a marriage because
[55:53] when that was read what came in the mind
[55:57] of the church is that we are happily
[56:00] married we are expecting to go home in
[56:04] the marriage
[56:06] supper can't wait to come back for the
[56:10] honeymoon but the next page was read oh
[56:15] my what is it as they turn the page over
[56:19] he changed the
[56:21] scenario he said Church you are on a
[56:29] Warfare woo
[56:31] God how he jump from a marriage the
[56:35] Beauty and the essence of a love life to
[56:38] a Warfare he said church we are in a
[56:43] Warfare but you are not wrestling
[56:45] against flesh and blood you are
[56:48] wrestling against
[56:50] principalities against Powers against
[56:53] rulers of the darkness of the church you
[56:57] are wrestling against spiritual
[57:00] wickedness in high
[57:03] places oh then he know what he did he
[57:07] told him how to prepare thems Lo loin
[57:11] guard your loins with truth oh
[57:16] breastplate put on the breastplate of
[57:20] righteousness oh shout your feet with
[57:23] the preparation of the go gospel of
[57:25] peace hold the shield of Faith make sure
[57:30] your head is covered with the helmet of
[57:36] salvation don't forget your
[57:42] sword don't forget your
[57:45] sword oh what a
[57:48] change what a change in the scenario you
[57:52] wonder why did he jump to to that
[57:56] because he was preparing their minds
[57:59] it's time to
[58:02] leave you are the wife of Christ you are
[58:06] married to Christ but it's time to leave
[58:11] what's on your
[58:14] minds what are you thinking
[58:17] about glory to God what are we thinking
[58:23] about Hallelujah
[58:27] notice in
[58:30] Exodus chapter
[58:34] 11 well from verse one to a few verses
[58:38] there I will pick
[58:40] out we're on the verge of leaving here
[58:44] we're on the eve of
[58:47] leaving brothers and
[58:49] sisters no doubt in my
[58:53] mind
[58:55] EXA oh God we got a few things to say
[58:59] today don't rush
[59:04] me my two friends will be in my corner
[59:08] don't rush me I know he's listening I
[59:10] love him I I'm going to pray I'm going
[59:13] to bless him before I left here
[59:14] especially oh God we want young men like
[59:17] those again around the
[59:19] place we want them again oh he's sweet
[59:22] he's
[59:23] sweet you that goes to tell you is on
[59:27] good
[59:29] Tage he's watching his daddy
[59:32] close I didn't know that you know until
[59:34] I see them sit there and say where he
[59:36] come from and I
[59:38] realized glory to God Amen a fruit
[59:43] wonderful fruit bearing so notice here
[59:46] Saints and just keep her thoughts in
[59:49] line what's on the
[59:52] Mind Seasons come and Seasons
[59:56] go amen is that right Seasons come and
[1:00:00] Seasons go we ought to be careful not to
[1:00:03] misunderstand the
[1:00:05] season sometimes you're here worshiping
[1:00:09] under the atmosphere of another
[1:00:12] season and then you may not be able to
[1:00:14] manipulate what is required of you for
[1:00:16] this season Oh Glory to God is that
[1:00:20] right Saints and and I know I'm right
[1:00:23] I'm that
[1:00:25] and so God have a way of allowing things
[1:00:28] to happen or to say some words even to
[1:00:32] your
[1:00:33] pastor to shift your
[1:00:36] mind because what you're thinking that's
[1:00:39] what you're
[1:00:43] becoming glory to God so you remember
[1:00:47] the first night was change of the
[1:00:49] Dynamics sir so what they keep looking

[1:01:01] the Believers to keep looking at that
[1:01:04] thinking about that and they are
[1:01:06] becoming
[1:01:08] that glory to God is all right pastors

[1:01:21] unto Moses yet will I bring one plague
[1:01:25] more upon pharaoh and upon Egypt
